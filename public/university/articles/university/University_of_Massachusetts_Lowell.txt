<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p>UMass Lowell and the city reached an agreement in 2009 for the school to acquire the Tsongas Arena and the  of land adjacent to it. The transfer was finalized in February 2010. The university bought the DoubleTree Hotel in downtown Lowell in 2009.

The building is called the UMass Lowell Inn &amp; Conference Center.</p>
<p>The university broke ground in June 2010 on the new Emerging Technologies Innovation Center, the first new academic building built on campus in 30 years. The building, which will be located on the former site of Smith Hall (demolished in July 2010), will cost $70 million with half of the funding coming from the state. There is also an academic building being planned for UMass Lowell's South Campus. It will house disciplines from humanities and the social sciences.  The groundbreaking is scheduled for fall of 2010. It will be a $40 million building with $26 million coming from the state.  The university is planning on building a parking deck on South Campus and a 600 space garage on North Campus.</p>
<p>In July 2009, the Massachusetts legislature eliminated from the Commonwealth's 2010 budget over $1 million in funding for the state's Toxic Use Reduction Institute, based on the UMass Lowell campus. In October 2009, it was announced that the university had secured federal stimulus funds that would enable the institute open through the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2010.</p>
