<h3>Brooklyn Campus</h3>
<p>This campus is centrally located in Brooklyn and close to transportation routes. The campus, called MetroTech, is easily accessible from all parts of New York City and Long Island. They have state-of-the-art facilities, including a brand new library, and new faculties for their electrical engineering, computer science and computer engineering programs. [[File:First Free Congregational Poly jeh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wunsch Building, Polytechnic Institute of New York|Wunsch Building]], a former church]] The Brooklyn campus offer programs primarily for undergraduates but also offers opportunities for graduate students, including those executive programs for students with related experience.</p>
<p>MetroTech Center:  Polytechnic Institute of New York University played a leadership role in bringing about <a>MetroTech Center</a>, one of the largest urban university-<a>corporate park</a>s in the world and the largest in the United States. Today, the 16-acre (65,000 m&#x00b2;), $1 billion complex is home to the institute and several technology-dependent companies, including <a>Securities Industry Automation Corporation</a> (SIAC), <a>New York City Police Department</a>'s 911 Center, <a>New York City Fire Department</a> Headquarters and the U.S. technology and operations functions of <a>JPMorgan Chase</a>. In 1998, a <a>Marriott Hotel</a> was built adjacent to MetroTech.  MetroTech has proven to be a case study in effective university, corporate, government and private-developer cooperation. It has resulted in renewing an area that once was characterized more by <a>urban decay</a>.</p>
<p><a>Wunsch Building</a> houses the school's undergraduate admissions offices and is used to host many social, cultural, and academic events for the school and community. The building dates back to 1847 and was the first independent black church in Brooklyn.  It was also a stop on the <a>Underground Railroad</a> and has been designated a historic landmark since November 24, 1981.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Dibner Library</a>The Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology, opened in 1990 in a new building, is Polytechnic's information hub, accessible online from anywhere, on or off campus, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, <a>wireless networks</a> allow users with notebook computers to access the library's electronic services from anywhere on campus.</p>
<p>The Poly community also has access to NYU's other libraries, including <a>Elmer Holmes Bobst Library</a> and Frederick L. Ehrman Medical Library.</p>
