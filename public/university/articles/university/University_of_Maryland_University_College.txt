<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Inn &amp; Conference Center</a> UMUC is an outgrowth of the <a>University of Maryland</a>'s evening program for adults that began in the 1920s. In 1947, the College of Special and Continuation Studies (CSCS) was established. In 1959, The CSCS became the University of Maryland University College (UMUC). In 1970, UMUC became an independent institution, but in 1988, it became a part of the <a>University System of Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>UMUC formerly had an international campus in <a>Schw&#x00e4;bisch Gm&#x00fc;nd</a>, <a>Germany</a> (near <a>Stuttgart</a>) until 2001. It also ran a 2-year <a>residential campus</a> in <a>Munich</a>, Germany from 1950 to 1992, which then moved to <a>Augsburg</a>, Germany from 1993 to 1994, and then to <a>Mannheim</a>, Germany in 1995 until it finally closed in 2005. The residential campus offered a two-year Associates degree and served mainly high school graduate children of U.S. military and government personnel stationed in <a>Europe</a>.</p>
<p>UMUC offers courses on over 130 military installations at locations throughout Europe, and the Middle East, as well as in Asia. In 2004, UMUC shared the ICDE Prize of Excellence from the International Council for Open and Distance Education. In FY 2007, UMUC's overseas divisions offered on-site classes in 22 countries throughout the world, enrolling 16,908 and 21,554 individual students, respectively through its Asia and Europe divisions, including the Middle East. </p>
<h3>University name</h3>
<p>UMUC is a <a>college</a> in the traditional American sense of the word, albeit one associated with a <a>university</a>. Hence, &quot;University College.&quot; The &quot;University of Maryland&quot; prefix indicates the historical entity to which the college originally belonged. In the university's name, &quot;University College&quot; represents &quot;the specialized concentration on profession development&quot;, while &quot;University of Maryland&quot; represents the affiliation of the university with the <a>University System of Maryland</a>. To American ears, the words &quot;university&quot; and &quot;college&quot; may sound synonymous, and &quot;University College&quot; would be redundant in its name. Among the collegiate universities of Europe, however, the practice of giving one college in the university the name &quot;University College&quot; is not uncommon. In England, for example, one of the 39 colleges of the <a>University of Oxford</a> is called <a>University College</a>. </p>
<p>When UMUC first opened in 1947, the school was named College of Special and Continuation Studies to distinguish it as an institution independent from the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a>., which are awarded in business management, computers/information technology, communications, criminal justice/legal studies, and social sciences. Undergraduate students can earn credit through classroom-based and online courses or through the Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs. The Undergraduate program serves as a continuation of the Community Colleges of Maryland and elsewhere. The Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs offer an escalated degree option for education and training completed in the workplace or military.  This program provides general education credits that can be applied towards a degree at UMUC.</p>
<h4>Graduate</h4>
<p>The Graduate School of Management &amp; Technology offers 18 <a>master's degree</a> programs, 38 graduate certificates, and a <a>Doctor of Management</a>. Most graduate programs are available in both classroom and online formats. Several master's degrees are available in an accelerated Executive format.</p>
<h2>Downrange Locations</h2>
<p>UMUC offers face-to-face courses and support in both Afghanistan and Iraq. UMUC deploys both faculty members and staff members to bases throughout Afghanistan and Iraq to support the war-fighters on those bases. UMUC has accompanied the war-fighters in downrange locations since the Army gave them clearance in 2005.</p>
<h3>Afghanistan</h3>
<p>Currently, UMUC offers courses and services at the four main Army Education Centers, located in Bagram Air Field, Kabul (Camp Phoenix), Salerno and Kandahar. Bagram Air Field is the largest site in Afghanistan, with about 275 active enrollments each session, and up to twenty face-to-face courses. All four sites have collegiate professors and Field Representatives stationed on them to assist soldiers, airmen, Marines, and sailors with UMUC's programs and courses.</p>
<p>Field Representatives, commonly referred to as Field Reps, deploy with faculty members to help promote and facilitate UMUC's program at each site. Field Reps assist students with enrollment, tuition assistance, and textbook sales, as well as guidance and assistance with academic goals and careers. The Field Rep is also responsible for the local program, to include marketing and maintaining relationships with military personnel.</p>
<p>Faculty members assigned to a downrange location teach servicemembers wherever they may be. Classroom space is limited in Afghanistan, and faculty members teach their classes anywhere they can, to include hangars, unit conference rooms, dining facilities, even chapels and picnic benches. Faculty members, known and referred to as instructors, also assist the Field Rep located where they are in assisting students and promoting classes and programs.</p>
<h3>Iraq</h3>
<p>UMUC has recently made an entrance into the Iraq Theater of Operations. Field Reps Stacey Tate and Danny Powers and Faculty have traveled from Germany to Baghdad and Balad to offer classes to servicemembers stationed in and around Baghdad. November 2008 marks the beginning of UMUC's support in Iraq, and classes will be starting in December 2008 and January 2009.</p>
<h2>Campus and facilities</h2>
<h3>Headquarters/main campus</h3>
<p>The headquarters for UMUC is located in <a>Adelphi</a>, <a>Maryland</a> near the campus of the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a>. Until late 2000, UMUC's headquarters was listed in <a>College Park</a>, Maryland. In an attempt to establish its own identity as an independent university and move away from the common notion of serving as the &quot;Night School&quot; for non-traditional students, UMUC changed its postal address to <a>Adelphi</a>, Maryland, an unincorporated community that borders College Park. The address change with the U.S. Postal Service involved no physical move of people and facilities. The marketing decision to change its postal address was one of many undertaken by UMUC to distinguish the university as one of the largest distance-education centers, with over 80,000 students enrolled worldwide.</p>
