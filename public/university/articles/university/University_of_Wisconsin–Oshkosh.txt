<p> The <strong>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Oshkosh</strong> (also known as <strong>UW&#x2013;Oshkosh</strong> or <strong>UW&#x2013;O</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> in <a>Oshkosh</a>, <a>Wisconsin</a>, USA. It is part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> and offers both bachelor and master degrees. The University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Oshkosh is the third-largest university in Wisconsin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1871 the school opened as Oshkosh State Normal School, <a>Wisconsin</a>'s third teacher-training school. Oshkosh Normal was the first state <a>normal school</a> in the United States to have a kindergarten.</p>
<p>The university was called Oshkosh State Teachers College from 1927 to 1951, Wisconsin State College&#x2013;Oshkosh from 1951 to 1964, and Wisconsin State University&#x2013;Oshkosh from 1964 to 1971. It became part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> in 1971.</p>
<p>Until the 1960s the Oshkosh student body was almost exclusively white. In 1968, when students protested against the lack of black faculty and black-oriented courses, the university expelled 94 students, mostly black, after using baton-wielding riot police to arrest them. The events were marked in a campus exhibit in 2008-09. The administration at the time has been described as &quot;conservative, paternalistic&quot; and &quot;ruled by elderly white males in the twilight of their careers&quot;.</p>
<p>The university has been expanding in capacity and infrastructure.  Student population and campus changed little through the 1980s and 1990s.  Since 2005, the institution has undertaken several green building projects and a Growth Agenda for new programs, faculty hiring and increased student population.   </p>
<p>In 2007, the Student Recreation and Wellness Center added a popular student-funded facility to the university waterfront, which has garnered an Innovative Architecture and Design award from Recreation Management Magazine.</p>
<p>In 2010, the campus opened a refurbished dining hall as its new Student Success Center.  The building consolidated student services into a single location.  It is designed to be one of the most energy efficient buildings in the state, with a geothermal ground source heating system installed beneath a nearby parking lot.</p>
<p>The campus has three major buildings under construction in 2010.  A new academic building, the first since 1971, will house the College of Business and allied departments from the College of Letters and Science, including Psychology, Geography, and Environmental Studies.  It is designed to use less than half the energy of similar buildings on campus, and to generate 10% of its energy from renewable technologies. A new residence hall will replace three older buildings to provide suite-style accommodations. The building will have numerous green building features, including geothermal and solar technologies. The third facility is the first commercial-scale dry fermentation anaerobic biodigester in the Americas, a waste-to-energy plant that will produce up to 10% of the campus electricity and heat.</p>
<p>Today, the school offers seven baccalaureate, seven masters, and one doctorate degrees in 73 programs spanning four colleges. The college is reputed to be strong in accounting, nursing, business, teaching, and fine arts.</p>

<h2>Historic places</h2>
<p>Three locations on the campus have been listed on <a>Registered Historic Places</a>.</p>
<h3>Oshkosh State Normal School Historic District</h3>
<p>Three buildings on the original campus comprise this historic district. Dempsey Hall serves as the administration center of the campus. Harrington Hall hosts geology classes. Swart Hall, completed in 1928, is used by the mathematics, social work, and sociology departments and houses the Center for Economic Education. It was originally used as a lab school where student teachers taught kindergarten through ninth grade students. </p>

<h3>Oviatt House</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Oviatt House</a> Moses Hooper moved to Oshkosh in 1863, and started construction of the house in 1882. It was located at the north edge of the Wisconsin State Normal School at Oshkosh. It cost approximately $20,000 to build. Hooper moved into his new residence on October 31, 1883. The structure had modern amenities including hot water heat and running water. The interior was painted by local painters Frank Waldo and Gustav Behncke. The house was sold on September 20, 1900 to Dr. Charles W. Oviatt, a surgeon who paid $18,000 for the property. After Oviatt's death in 1912, his heirs sold the house and grounds to the State Normal School Regents in 1913 with the agreement that the heirs could live in the house until June 1914.</p>
<p>The house was first used by the school as a women's dormitory, the first on campus. Because the dormitory operated at a loss, school president Polk discontinued the venture in 1932. After considering dismantling the building, Polk started renting the house from the school in 1934. The following three presidents of the school also resided in the house, ending with President Penson in 1989. The <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Oshkosh Foundation</a> moved its office in the house the following year.</p>
<p>The college turned the residence into a women's <a>dormitory</a> which could house up to 32 co-eds. In the 1960s it was used as an honors dormitory until closing in 1967. From 1967 until 1970 it housed the College of Nursing administrative offices. When the College of Nursing was relocated to a new building, the structure was taken over by the Alumni Association, who have occupied it since 1970. It is occasionally used for special functions.</li>
