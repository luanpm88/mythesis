<h2>History=</h2>
<p>The school was founded in 1886 by through the offices of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was known as the <strong>Delaware Conference Academy</strong>.
Later UMES came to be called <strong>Industrial Branch of Morgan State College and Princess Anne Academy</strong>.
The State of Maryland, in operating its Land-Grant program at the Maryland Agricultural College at College Park, which did not admit African American students, sought to provide a Land-Grant program for African Americans.
In 1919 the state of <a>Maryland</a> assumed control of the academy and changed its name to <strong>Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College</strong>.
In 1948 the name was again changed, this time to <strong>Maryland State College</strong>.
Finally, in 1970, the name became University of Maryland of Eastern Shore.</p>

With the strong support of the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, Administration, and the faculty, UMES has developed an academic program perhaps more impressive than any other higher education institution of its size in the East.

<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Athletics logo</a> UMES was one of the founding members of the <a>Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference</a> in 1970.
The school left the MEAC in 1979 but rejoined in 1981 and has been a member ever since.
The Hawks compete in 15 sports at the <a>Division I</a> level: seven men's and eight women's.
</p>
<p>The school was once a powerhouse in black college <a>football</a>, producing five undefeated seasons between 1947 and 1960, but like many smaller <a>colleges</a>, the high costs associated with operating a Division I football program and complying with <a>Title IX</a> became too much of a burden, and the team was shut down after the 1979 season.
In 1948, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and Albright College played the first intercollegiate football game between an Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institution and a majority-white institution.
NFL player and coach <a>Art Shell</a> attended UMES.</p>

They won the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match).
The team was led by All-Tournament players Jessica Worsley (who was named the tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez.
With the series win, UMES became the first HBCU to win a women's NCAA national championship.
The women's bowling team came in 2nd at the NCAA National Championship in 2007 (Orlando, Florida) who fell to <a>Vanderbilt University</a> in a 4-3 series.
