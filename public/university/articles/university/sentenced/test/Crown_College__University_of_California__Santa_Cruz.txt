<p> <strong>Crown College</strong> is one of the <a>residential college</a>s that makes up the <a>University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, <a>USA</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its thematic grounding in natural science and technology, like at all UCSC colleges, Crown students major in subjects across all disciplines.
Crown has a favorable reputation for academically-focused students, possibly due to both its reputation as a science college and its secluded location on the Santa Cruz campus.
Because of its strong academic roots, Crown College is regarded as one of the quieter colleges on the campus.
It is very close to Upper Campus, frequented by hikers and mountain bikers, and near where drum circles take place during full moons.</p>
<p>Residents of the college are informally known as &quot;crownies.&quot;</p>
<h2>History and campus</h2>
<p>Crown was founded in 1967 when the Chancellor <a>Dean E. McHenry</a> invited chemist <a>Kenneth V. Thimann</a> to come to <a>Santa Cruz</a> and head what would become Crown College and to build the science faculty at <a>UCSC</a>.
</p>
<p>Located on the upper northern side of campus by <a>Merrill College</a>, Crown also borders the newly constructed Colleges <a>Nine</a> and <a>Ten</a>.
Crown is made up of eight three-floor residence halls as well as having about half of the Crown-Merrill apartment buildings.
The UCSC fire station is located at Crown.</p>
<p>Because of its strong science-related roots and continuing tradition, all of the student residence buildings have science-related themes and names: <a>Gauss</a> House, <a>Galen</a> House, <a>Rutherford</a> House, <a>Harvey</a> and <a>Maxwell</a> Houses, <a>Leonardo</a> House, <a>Galileo</a> House, and <a>Descartes</a> House.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Crown College started the popular College game of <a>Humans vs Zombies</a> attracting up to one hundred students when they meet, this is also the location where the USSC zombie defense council will be formed.</p>

  <li><a>Sandra M. Faber</a> &#x2013; Professor of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics noted for invention of <a>Cold dark matter</a> theory and fundamental work in the field of <a>Galaxy formation and evolution</a>; member of the <a>NAS</a>; member of the <a>AAAS</a> (elected 1989)</li>
  <li><a>David Haussler</a> &#x2013; Professor of Biomolecular Engineering noted for work on the human genome and development of the <a>UCSC Genome Browser</a> as part of the <a>Human Genome Project</a>; member of the <a>AAAS</a> (elected 2006)&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;</li>
  <li><a>Douglas N. C. Lin</a> &#x2013; Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics; member of the <a>AAAS</a> (elected 2002)&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;<a>(Publications at Scientific Commons)</a></li>
  <li><a>Harry Noller</a> &#x2013; Professor of Biology noted for RNA research; member of the <a>AAAS</a> (elected 1969)&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;</li>
  <li><a>Joel Primack</a> &#x2013; Professor of Physics, noted <a>cosmologist</a>; renowned for Cold Dark Matter Theory proposed along with Sandra Faber (see above) and <a>Sir Martin Rees</a></li>
  <li><a>Kenneth V. Thimann</a> &#x2013; Founding Provost notable for his research in biology; in 1934, obtained and isolated pure <a>auxin</a>, an important plant-growth hormone and, with several coworkers, proved that auxin promotes cell elongation, formation of roots, and growth of buds, discoveries that led to the development of a widely used synthetic auxin, <a>2,4-D</a>.
Use of this chemical prevents the premature falling of fruit and stimulates cut stems to grow abundant roots.
Because high concentrations of auxins are toxic to most plants, synthetic auxins are effective weed killers.
This research was used in the subsequent development of the Vietnam-era herbicide <a>Agent Orange</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Stephen Thorsett</a> &#x2013; Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Dean of Physical and Biological Science known for work on properties of compact stars</li>
  <li><a>Stanford E. Woosley</a> &#x2013; Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics noted for his work on <a>supernova</a> <a>gamma ray burst</a>s; member of the <a>NAS</a> and <a>AAAS</a> (elected 2001)&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;</li>
