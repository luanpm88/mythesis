<p>The <strong>New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</strong> (abbreviated to <strong>CALS</strong> or <strong>Ag School</strong>) is a <a>statutory college</a> at <a>Cornell University</a>, a <a>private</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Ithaca, New York</a>.
With about 3,100 <a>undergraduate</a> and 1,000 <a>graduate</a> students enrolled, it is the third-largest college of its kind in the <a>United States</a> and the second-largest <a>undergraduate</a> college or school at Cornell.
It is the only school of agriculture in the <a>Ivy League</a>.
The undergraduate business program at CALS is one of only two such Ivy League programs accredited by the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a> (AACSB).</p>
<p>As part of Cornell's land-grant mission, the college jointly administers New York's <a>cooperative extension</a> program with the <a>College of Human Ecology</a> and it runs both the <a>New York State Agricultural Experiment Station</a>, in <a>Geneva, New York</a>, and the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, in addition to many other research facilities around the state.</p>
<p>For 2007-08, CALS total budget (excluding the Geneva Station) is $283 million, with $96 million coming from tuition and $52 million coming from state appropriations.
The Geneva Station budget was an additional $25 million.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Established in 1874 as the Department of Agriculture, the department became a college in 1888.
In 1904, eminent <a>botanist</a> and <a>horticulturist</a> <a>Liberty Hyde Bailey</a>, along with <a>New York State</a> farmers, convinced the <a>New York Legislature</a> to financially support the agriculture college at Cornell, a private <a>university</a> that had been established in 1865 as New York's <a>land-grant</a> institution.
Thus, it became a <a>statutory college</a>, and changed its name from the New York State College of Agriculture in 1904 to the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1971.</p>
<p>In 1898, the State Legislature established a separate <a>New York State College of Forestry at Cornell</a>.
However, the school ran into political controversy, and the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation in 1903.
In 1910, <a>Liberty Hyde Bailey</a>, the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.
At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named <a>Fernow Hall</a>.
That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources.
In 1927, Cornell established a  research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.</p>
<p>In 1900, the college began offering a reading course for farm women.
In 1907, the Department of Home Economics was created within college.
In 1919, the Department of Home Economics became a school within the Agriculture College.
Finally, in 1925, the Home Economics department became a separate college, although both colleges continued to work together to provide cooperative extension services.</p>
<p>The <a>World Food Prize</a> has been awarded for the sixth time to a Cornellian.
Dr. Andrew Colin McClung, M.S. 1949, was awarded the World Food Prize for helping to transform a large area of Brazil into fertile land.
His recommendations regarding key agricultural inputs made this transformation possible.</p>

<h3>The Agriculture Quadrangle</h3>
<p>[[Image:CornellAgQuad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Agriculture Quad viewed from Bradfield Hall, [[Ithaca, NY|Ithaca's]] West Hill and <a>Cayuga Lake</a> in the background]]<strong>The Agriculture Quadrangle</strong> (<strong>Ag Quad</strong>) contains buildings which house many of the programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
It is a <a>quadrangle</a> east of the <a>Arts Quad</a> and west of the <a>College of Veterinary Medicine</a>.
The oldest building still standing on the quad is <a>Caldwell Hall</a>, opened in 1913.
The Plant Science Building opened in 1931 and Warren Hall, across from Plant Science, opened in the next year, The <a>art deco</a> style Mann Library on the eastern end of the quad, connecting Warren Hall on the north to the Plant Sciences Building on the south, opened in 1952.
Completed in 1990, Kennedy and Roberts Halls, featuring an archway that connects the two halls, extend along the western face of the quad, having replaced the original Roberts Hall (1906).
The Computing and Communications Center (1912, formerly Comstock Hall) stands between Roberts and Caldwell Halls.
These buildings are owned by New York State, which pays for their construction and maintenance.</p>
<h3>Other facilities</h3>
<p>The college operates the <a>New York State Agricultural Experiment Station</a>,  in <a>Geneva, New York</a>, 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) northwest of the main campus.
The facility comprises 20 major buildings on 130&nbsp;acres (0.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land, as well as more than 700&nbsp;acres (2.8&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of test plots and other lands devoted to horticultural research.
It also operates three substations, Vineyard Research Laboratory in <a>Fredonia</a>, Hudson Valley Laboratory in <a>Highland</a> and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in <a>Riverhead</a>.</p>
<p>The Dilmun Hill Student Farm is a student-run farm that has been practicing sustainable agriculture on Cornell University's campus since 1996.
It is located near the intersection of Judd Falls Rd. and Rt.
366 (Dryden Rd).</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The <a>undergraduate</a> programs lead to the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> in at least one of the 23 currently offered majors.
The college also offers <a>graduate</a> degrees in various fields of study through the <a>Graduate School</a>, including the <a>M.A.T.</a>, <a>M.L.A.</a>, <a>M.P.S.</a>, <a>M.S.</a>, and <a>Ph.D.</a></p>

<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>The <a>Undergraduate Business Program at Cornell University</a> (or Applied Economics and Management program) ranked 4th Nationally in BusinessWeek's Best Undergraduate Business Programs for 2008.
In 2009, <em>DesignIntelligence</em> magazine ranked Cornell's undergraduate and graduate landscape architecture programs as 4th and 3rd respectively, in the nation.</p>
<h3>Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory</h3>
<p> The <strong>Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory</strong> was inaugurated in July 2001, as a research facility dedicated to education, conservation, and the discovery of novel medicinal compounds from applied field chemoecology, under the direction of Dr. <a>Eloy Rodriguez</a>.
The laboratory was constructed in partnership with the Amazon Yarapa River Lodge, an ecotourism venture, with funds granted from <a>Cornell University</a>, the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, and private donations.</p>
<p>The laboratory is located in the <a>Amazon Rainforest</a> along the banks of the Yarapa River, a remote tributary of the <a>Amazon River</a> in <a>Peruvian Amazon Rainforest</a>.
Jaldar, the closest native village, has been brought into an agreement to serve as custodians of the land and manage it in a way consistent with conservation and sustainable use.
Further upstream can be found the villages of Nuevo Loreto and Puerto Miguel, and on an adjacent tributary the village of Jerusalem where a local <a>shaman</a> leads students in botanical expeditions.</p>
<p>Research at the EsBaran Field Laboratory relies heavily on the collaboration of local guides with native knowledge of the rainforest.
Students engage local children in an exchange of knowledge to facilitate the sharing of perspectives and cultural assets.</p>
