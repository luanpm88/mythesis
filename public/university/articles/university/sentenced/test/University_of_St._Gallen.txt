<p>The <strong>University of St.Gallen</strong> (in German: <em>Universit&#x00e4;t St.Gallen</em>) is a <a>research university</a> based in <a>St.
Gallen</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>.
Highly regarded in Europe, it enjoys an unrivaled reputation in the German-speaking region, given its record of placing its graduates in leadership positions in a variety of organizations across the Continent.</p>
<p>The University is generally known as <strong>HSG</strong>, which is an acronym derived from its full name Universit&#x00e4;t St.Gallen &#x2013; Hochschule f&#x00fc;r Wirtschafts-, Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaften.
It is also known in <a>English</a> as the <em>University of St.Gallen for Business Administration, Economics, Law and Social Sciences</em>.
</p>
<p>Despite being one of the smallest universities in Switzerland, it has the largest <a>business</a> <a>faculty</a> in Switzerland and is considered to be one of the leading schools for business, economics and public administration in Europe.</p>
<p>The University of St.Gallen is a member of the <a>CEMS</a> and <a>APSIA</a> networks.
It is <a>EQUIS</a> and <a>AACSB</a> accredited.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of St.Gallen (HSG), Switzerland, was founded as a &quot;Business Academy&quot; in 1898 - in the heyday of the St. Gallen embroidery industry - and offered its first lectures in 1899.
It is therefore one of the oldest universities of its kind in the world.
The HSG continues to pursue the goal of providing students with a practice-oriented education, guided by an integrative view of business, economics, law, and social sciences.
With success: the University of St.Gallen has constantly been ranked among the top business schools in Europe.
Accreditations by EQUIS and AACSB International underline its commitment to a holistic curriculum that meets the highest academic standards.</p>
<p>In autumn 2009, there were about 6,500 students, 80 tenured professors, 60 assistant professors and senior lecturers, and over 300 lecturers and 300 assistants.
The University is financed by the Canton of <a>St.
Gallen</a> and other cantons.
The laws of the Canton of <a>St.
Gallen</a> give the University far-reaching research autonomy.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The HSG is located on top of Rosenberg hill, overlooking the old town of St. Gallen and the Alps.
A remarkable feature is the integration of art and architecture throughout the campus.
</p>
<p>In the Main Building, designed by Walter Foerderer  and regarded as a significant examplar of 1960s architecture far beyond Switzerland's borders, art tends to play the role of a counterpart to the architecture, whereas in the Library Building of 1989, the works of art complement the diversity of architectural forms in a narrative fashion.</p>
<p>There are works by Burckhardt, Mastroianni, <a>Kem&#x00e9;ny</a>, Penalba , <a>Arp</a>, <a>Braque</a>, <a>Hajdu</a>, Soniatta, <a>Mir&#x00f3;</a>, <a>Calder</a>, <a>Soulages</a>, <a>Giacometti</a>, <a>T&#x00e0;pies</a>, <a>Coghuf</a>, Valentin, <a>Otto M&#x00fc;ller</a>, Stahly, Baier, Bodmer, Oertli, Gehr, Gubler, Prantl, Baumgarten, <a>Disler</a>, <a>Bill</a>, <a>Josef Felix M&#x00fc;ller</a>, <a>Paladino</a>, <a>Richter</a>, Fabro, and <a>Cucchi</a>.</p>
<p>HSG offers the latest facilities and services to support individual and collaborative learning, including web-based communication platforms and wireless LAN.
The library contains around 400,000 bound volumes, some 1,500 journals and a vast selection of e-journals.
To keep body and mind in balance a full spectrum of sports activities awaits the students, from aerobics to yoga.
The University's attractive location between Lake Constance and the Alps makes St. Gallen an ideal setting for all kinds of leisure activities.</p>
