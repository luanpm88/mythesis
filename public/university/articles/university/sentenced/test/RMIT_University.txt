<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>[[File:ConstructionWorkingMensCollegeMelbourne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Construction of the [[Working Men's College of Melbourne|Working Men's College]], circa 1880s]] The <a>Working Men's College of Melbourne</a> was founded in 1887 by a prominent <a>grazier</a> and <a>philanthropist</a>, <a>The Hon.</a> <a>Francis Ormond</a> <a>MLC</a>, who donated &#x00a3;5000 toward the establishment of the college.
The Council of the <a>Melbourne Trades Hall</a> then matched Ormond's initial donation through rallying its members.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, the university underwent a rapid expansion and amalgamated a number of neighbouring institutes.</p>
<p>RMIT is also ranked as the top <a>entrepreneurial</a> university in Australia, and 12th in the World, according to the GSEA annual Top Entrepreneurial Universities List.
It is ranked as the top advertising school of the decade in Australia and 5th in the World, according the YoungGuns International Awards.
In Victoria, RMIT is currently ranked as the 3rd most research-intensive university, and 10th in Australia.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is a <a>public university</a> created under the <em>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act of 1992</em> by the <a>Government of Victoria</a>.
Before its creation as a public university, RMIT was a private institution for 105 years.
Each school is grouped into one of three academically-contextual colleges, which are known as &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Design and Social Context&quot; and &quot;Science, Engineering and Health&quot;.
Most schools also maintain their own field-relevant research collections, which are in addition to the <a>RMIT University Library</a> network (<em>see: <a>Notable school collections</a></em>).
RMIT's 30+ centres of excellence are also grouped into a college according to their context, to allow for cross-field research.</p>

The two unions differ in that RMIT Union is an unincorporated subsidiary body owned by the university that's concerned with <a>campus</a> life and administers a wide range of arts, sporting and recreational activities and collectives for students.
Whereas RMIT Student Union is an independent, not-for-profit and student-run organisation that's concerned with <a>student</a> life, and administers clubs and services in support of students.
A number of other activities and clubs are also run independently of RMIT's unions, usually within a school of the university.</p>
