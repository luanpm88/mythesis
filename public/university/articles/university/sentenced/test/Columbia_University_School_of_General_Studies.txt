<p>The <strong>School of General Studies</strong>, commonly known as <strong>General Studies</strong> or simply <strong>GS</strong>, is <a>Columbia University</a>'s undergraduate college for <a>non-traditional students</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>GS students have the option to attend part- or full-time (unlike <a>Columbia College</a>, whose students are required to attend full-time).
In the 2006 class, the average age was 27 for incoming students, and the majority attend full-time.</p>
<p>GS awards both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.
Located at Columbia University's <a>Morningside Heights</a> campus, GS is also home to Columbia's Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program, which is the largest and oldest in the United States.
</p>
<p>Students at GS take the same classes, with the same professors, and earn the same degree as students in Columbia&#x2019;s other undergraduate colleges.
A Columbia undergraduate class could include students from any of the following schools: GS, Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Barnard College.
<a>thumbnail|left|200px|General Studies Student Council's Owl Logo as sketched in 2007</a> While Columbia University&#x2019;s mascot is a lion, the School of General Studies has its own mascot: the owl, which was selected for two reasons.
First, it represents a connection to night classes, which most GS students attended in the School's early days.
Second, the owl represents Athena and thus knowledge and wisdom; an owl can be found hiding in the robes of the university's central <a><em>Alma Mater</em> statue</a>.
The school also has a separate motto - &quot;<em>Lux In Tenebris Lucet,</em>&quot; Latin for: <em>The light that shines in the darkness</em>.</p>
<p>In 2006, two students composed the school song, or Alma Mater.
&quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot; was conceived by lyricist/student Erich Erving the student/composer Paul Farinella provided the music.
The fully orchestrated recording premiered in May 2006, during class day.
It is hoped that &quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot;  will be given equal consideration and representation as the song Sans Souci during class day exercises.
&quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot; can be heard via the following link:  <a>http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gssc/senior2006/index.shtml</a>
&quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot; is the only Alma Mata composed by two students matriculating at a school during the time of its creation.
</p>
<p>The school&#x2019;s name refers to its diverse student body by alluding to medieval universities, which were also known as <em><a>studia generalia</a></em>.
Unlike the <em>studia partiuclaria</em>, schools that educated only members of a local population, the <em>studia generalia</em> were degree-granting institutions that served a much broader, often international group of students and scholars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:1950 shield72 large.jpg|right|thumb|The
GS [[coat of arms]], as first sketched in 1950]]  Nontraditional education began at Columbia in the 1830s.
A formal program, Extension Teaching (later renamed University Extension), was created by Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1904.
In the 2009-2010 school year, the school hosts 88 of Columbia's 210 studying veterans.</p>
<p>Formerly housed in the Alumni House, now known as Buell Hall, the School of General Studies moved to its current location, Lewisohn Hall, in 1964.
GS admissions statistics are not reported in conjunction with CC/SEAS statistics.
This is related both to GS's different admission deadlines and the fact that CC/SEAS and GS have different applicant pools.
</p>
<p>Additionally GS students deal with a dearth of financial aid funding.
Because GS is operated separately from the joint administration of CC and SEAS, it is not covered in the plan to eliminate student loans for CC and SEAS students with family incomes below $50,000, an initiative applicable only to the financial aid office under CC/SEAS's Division of Student Affairs.</p>
<h2>Myths</h2>
<ul>
  <li>GS is night school.</li>
</ul>
<p>:GS students attend the same classes as students in other colleges at the university.
Columbia offers some classes at night, which are available to all students.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GS is an extension program.</li>
</ul>
<p>:GS is a degree-granting college.
Students are expected to pursue a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.
The separate <a>Columbia School of Continuing Education</a> offers individual courses on a non-degree basis.
(<a>Brown University</a> and <a>Yale University</a> nontraditional student programs do not have full-fledged undergraduate colleges devoted to nontraditional students, though Brown's RUE Program and Yale's <a>Eli Whitney Students Program</a> are considered among the most integrated nontraditional student programs in the Ivy League.
The College of Liberal and Professional Studies at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> also serves nontraditional students and offers heavily discounted night classes taught by a faculty that includes tenured professors, adjunct professors, and advanced graduate students (though LPS students also have the option to take day classes).)</p>
<ul>
  <li>GS is a back door to CC.</li>
</ul>
<p>:* It is unclear whether anyone has ever successfully transferred into CC or another Columbia undergraduate school from GS.
The official policy reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Undergraduates enrolled in the School of General Studies, including Joint Program students, who are interested in transferring to another Columbia or affiliated undergraduate school (Columbia College, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Barnard College, or List College/JTS) should not submit a transfer application to any of those schools without prior consultation with their GS advisors.
</p>
  <p>Transfer applications from GS to Columbia College, SEAS, or the Joint Program with JTS will not be considered by those schools without a written endorsement from the GS Dean of Students.
Endorsements are limited to those students in good standing who have sound academic reasons for seeking to transfer from GS. Joint Program students who are considering the submission of a transfer application to one of the Columbia undergraduate schools, including GS, should also discuss the matter with their GS and JTS advisors; transfer to GS is not automatic for Joint Program students and requires a new application to GS through the Office of Admissions.</p>
