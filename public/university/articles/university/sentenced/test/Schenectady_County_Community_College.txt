<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Schenectady County Board of Representatives</a> formed Schenectady County Community College on January 26, 1967 and then purchased the former Van Curler hotel which required renovations so that classes could commence in the building in 1969.
The Van Curler would be renamed Elston Hall after Charles W. Elston, the long standing, original board member and eight-year chairperson for the Schenectady County Board of Representatives.</p>
<p>The first of a number expansions occurred in 1978, with the building that houses the Begley library, a television stations, lecture halls, and a wing for the music department along with the Carl B. Taylor Community Auditorium.
A 1982 expansion added the Tempo Building, housing four classrooms and continuing education.
1987 brought the Center for Science and  Technology, while 1992 saw the creation of a new student center which included a cafeteria, college store, student lounge, along with <a>biology</a> and <a>geology</a> labs and fifteen classrooms.
Also completed in 1992 was a South Wing expansion which created four new <a>culinary arts</a> labs, expanded upon the Casola Dining Room, and added a childcare center, and an enclosed bridge that connected Elston Hall with the Center for Science and Technology which is located across the street from the school's main campus.</p>
<p>In 2000 the Gateway Building was erected  for childhood development classes and a childcare center.
The next year the Stockade Building was build in order to house  six computer classrooms, nine general classrooms, two lecture halls, conference rooms and offices for the Continuing Education Division and Capital District World Trade Center.
Additionally a new quad area was build in front of Elston Hall.</p>
<p>In 2006 a $6.3 million dollar expansion to the Culinary Arts department began off of Elston Hall and was completed in 2007.
This expansion was funded in part by fund raising activities along with $3,082,300 from the <a>County of Schenectady</a>.</p>
<p>The process is underway for the building of , five-story building to house 313 student dorm rooms for the college.
The estimated cost of this project will be $20 million with an expected opening date of fall 2009.</p>
