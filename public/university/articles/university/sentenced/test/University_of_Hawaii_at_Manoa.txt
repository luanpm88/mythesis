<p>The <strong>University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa</strong> is a public, co-educational <a>university</a> and is the flagship campus of the greater <a>University of Hawaii system</a>.
The school is located in <a>M&#x0101;noa</a>, an urban neighborhood community of <a>Honolulu CDP</a>, <a>City and County of Honolulu</a>, <a>Hawaii</a>, <a>United States</a>, approximately three miles east and inland from <a>downtown Honolulu</a> and one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from <a>Ala Moana</a> and <a>Waik&#x012b;k&#x012b;</a>.
The campus occupies the eastern half of the mouth of the greater M&#x0101;noa Valley.
It is accredited by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a> and is governed by the <a>Hawaii State Legislature</a> and a semi-autonomous Board of Regents, which in turn hires a president to be administrator.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Hawaii at M&#x0101;noa was founded in 1907 as a <a>land grant college</a> of agriculture and mechanical arts.
In 1912 it was renamed the College of Hawaii and moved to its present location.
William Kwai Fong Yap petitioned the territorial legislature six years later for university status which led to another renaming to the University of Hawai'i in 1920.
This is also the founding year of the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1931 the Territorial Normal and Training School was absorbed into the university.
It is now the College of Education.</p>
<h2>College</h2>
<p>[[Image:UniversityHawaiiManoaCampusRoundtop.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Manoa
campus with [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] from <a>Round Top Drive</a>]] Today the primary facet of the university consists of the four Colleges of Arts and Sciences: Arts and Humanities, Languages Literatures and Linguistics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.
The college of agriculture and mechanical arts is now the <a>College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources</a> (CTAHR), one of the few agricultural colleges in the United States focused on tropical research.
The University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa is also home to two of the most prominent professional schools in the state.
The <a>William S. Richardson School of Law</a> and the <a>John A. Burns School of Medicine</a> are the only law and medical schools in Hawai<img>i, respectively.
The <a>Center for Hawaiian Studies</a> provides 'excellence in the pursuit of knowledge concerning the Native people of Hawai<img>i' [<a>http://www.hawaii.edu/chs/</a>].</p>
<p>Together, the colleges of the university offer bachelor degrees in 87 fields of study, master degrees in 87 fields, doctoral degrees in 53 fields, first professional degrees in three fields, post-baccalaureate degrees in three fields, 29 undergraduate certification programs and 26 graduate certification programs.
Total enrollment as of 2006 was 20,357 students, 14,307 of which are undergraduates.
There are approximately sixteen students per instructor.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>With extramural grants and contracts in excess of $300 million in 2002-03, UH-Manoa exploded in terms of research related to Hawaii's physical landscape, its people, and their heritage.
The landscape facilitates advances in marine biology, oceanography, underwater robotic technology, astronomy, geology and geophysics, agriculture, aquaculture and tropical medicine.
Its heritage, the people and its close ties to the Asian and Pacific region create a favorable environment for study and research in the arts, genetics, intercultural relations, linguistics, religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Extramural funding increased from $211 million in FY 2002 to nearly $255 million in FY 2003.
Research grants increased from $125 million in FY 2002 to $165 million in FY 2003.
Nonresearch awards totaled $90 million in FY 2003.
Overall, extramural funding has increased by 50% over the past ten years.
Princeton Review and The National Science Foundation ranks UH Manoa in the top 30 public universities for federal research funding in engineering and science</p>
<p>The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) received the largest amount of extramural funding among the Manoa units at $60 million.
SOEST was followed by the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) at $41 million, the College of Natural Sciences at $24 million, the Institute for Astronomy at $22 million, the Pacific Basin Research Center at $21 million, the College of Education at $19 million, and the Cancer Research Center of Hawai&#x2018;i at $18 million.</p>
<p>Systemwide, the majority of research funding comes from the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce, and the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA).
For nonresearch grants, the majority of funding comes from Hawai&#x2018;i government agencies, the Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, Hawai&#x2018;i health organizations, and NASA.</p>
<p>The new $150-million medical complex in the area of Kaka&#x2018;ako opened in the spring of 2005.
The facility houses a state-of-the-art biomedical research and education center that attracts significant federal funding and private sector investment in biotechnology research and development.

<li>The <a>Lyon Arboretum</a> serves as the only tropical <a>arboretum</a> belonging to any University in the United States.
The Arboretum, located in Manoa Valley, was established in 1918 by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association to demonstrate watershed restoration and test various tree species for reforestation, as well as collect living plants of economic value.
In 1953, it became part of the University of Hawai&#x02bb;i at Manoa.
Its over 15,000 accessions focus primarily on the monocot families of palms, gingers, heliconias, bromeliads, and aroids.</li>

The University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a>, the only Hawai<img>i school to do so.

[[Image:Aloha Stadium, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|right|The
off-campus [[Aloha Stadium]], situated near <a>Pearl Harbor</a> in <a>Honolulu</a> has been the home of Warrior Football since 1975.]]
&lt;!--  Commented out: <a>thumb|left|Hawaii Athletic Logo</a> --&gt; The men's teams were formerly known as the <em>Rainbow Warriors</em> but in 2000, in response to complaints from the football program that the rainbow was a symbol of <a>homosexuality</a>, the University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa athletics program allowed each sport to select their own team names.
The current situation is rather confusing; various men's teams are called the <em>Warriors</em>, the <em>Rainbow Warriors</em>, or the <em>Rainbows</em>.
The men's volleyball team chose the name <em>Men of War</em>, but that name proved to be unpopular and was replaced by the <em>Warriors</em>.
</p>
<p>The women's teams are called the <em><a>Rainbow Wahine</a></em>.
This name is often shortened to <em>The Rainbows</em> or <em>The 'Bows</em>.
</p>
<p>The <em>Warriors</em> and <em>Rainbow Wahine</em> are most notable for their highly-ranked men's and women's <a>basketball</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>baseball</a> and <a>football</a> programs.
The University also won the 2004 <a>Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships</a>.
The women's volleyball program has won NCAA championships in 1982, 1983 and 1987.
The men's volleyball won an NCAA championship in 2002, but it was later vacated due to violations.</p>
<p>The principal sports venues are <a>Aloha Stadium</a>, <a>Stan Sheriff Center</a>, <a>Les Murakami Stadium</a>, <a>Rainbow Wahine Softball Stadium</a>, and the <a>Duke Kahanamoku Aquatic Complex</a>.</p>
<p>The universities athletic budget in FY 2008-2009 is $29.6 Million.</p>
<h2>Chancellors</h2>
<p>From 1986 to 2001, the President of the <a>University of Hawaii system</a> also served as the M&#x0101;noa campus's chancellor.
In 2001, the position of Chancellor was recreated by then-UH president <a>Evan Dobelle</a> after several years of discussion around the possible conflict of interest that might arise in this dual role (being the president of a University system while concurrently being the chancellor of a specific campus within the system).</p>
