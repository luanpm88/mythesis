<p>  <strong>Southeastern Louisiana University</strong> is a state-funded public <a>university</a> in <a>Hammond</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>.
It was founded in 1925 by <a>Linus A. Sims</a>, the <a>principal</a> of <a>Hammond</a> <a>High School</a>, as <a>Hammond Junior College</a>, located in a wing of the high school building.
Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College.
It achieved university status in 1970.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are approximately 15,000 students representing 43 states and 66 countries enrolled.
During the 1990s Southeastern was the fastest-growing college in the United States.
</p>
<p>Southeastern's colors are <a>green</a> and <a>gold</a>, and the nickname is the <em><a>Lions</a></em>.
Southeastern's sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (FCS for <a>football</a>) in the <a>Southland Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>240px|thumb|left|Commons Area in Southeastern's War Memorial Student Union</a> What began as a junior college supported by local taxes developed into a major university as Southeastern has grown to meet the evolving needs of southeast Louisiana and the Florida parishes.
<a>420px|right|thumb|Fayard Hall, completed in 2001, makes practical use of brick, glass, light, and open space.</a></p>
<p>On July 7, 1925, the voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue that created Hammond Junior College.
Operated under the auspices of the Tangipahoa Parish <a>School Board</a>, Sims opened the doors on September 13, 1925, with a faculty of three women and two men and 40  students.
The two-year coeducational institution offered basic undergraduate work in arts and sciences that culminated in a teaching certificate.
</p>
<p>Rapidly increasing enrollments quickly forced the college out of its two rooms in Hammond High School.
In 1927, voters supported the purchase of the Hunter Leake estate on Hammond&#x2019;s north end.
In 1928, Hammond Junior College became Southeastern Louisiana College, formally adopted into the state educational system under the control of the State Board of Education.
The purchase of  adjoining the original  plot provided the space to develop a suitable campus.
In 1934, a state bond issue provided for the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium.
</p>
<p>Lucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935.
As of 2009 it is the oldest building constructed by the University.
McGehee Hall is on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>In 1937, the State Board of Education authorized curricula for four-year programs in liberal arts, teacher education, business administration, music, social sciences, and physical education.
The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred in May 1939.

Zachary Taylor Hall is the only academic building in Louisiana named for the sole <a>President</a> to come from Louisiana.]]
Voter approval of Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted Southeastern Louisiana College the same legal status as other four-year colleges.
The amendment did not, however, require the state to fund Southeastern at the level of other institutions of higher education, despite strong local support.
</p>
<p>On January 18, 1946, the State Board made available funds to purchase seven city blocks east and west of the campus, and  of land north and northwest of the campus, increasing Southeastern&#x2019;s total area to approximately .
</p>
<p>On March 3, 1946, Southeastern was formally approved and accepted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as a four-year degree-granting institution.

<p>After World War II, returning G.I.s caused exponential growth of the college, necessitating construction of classrooms, a student union, a cafeteria, a health center, dormitories, apartments for married students, and many surplus temporary buildings donated by the federal government.
In 1948, the U.S. Navy contributed two steel barracks for use as dormitories including McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007).
</p>
<p>In 1960, the State Board authorized Southeastern to offer master&#x2019;s degrees through the newly-formed Division of Graduate Studies.
Southeastern began awarding the Education Specialist degree in 1967.
The War Memorial Student Union, constructed in the mid-1960s, is the only student union building in the United States dedicated to alumni who died in World War II.
Governor John J. McKeithen on June 16, 1970, signed into law the legislative act turning Southeastern Louisiana College into Southeastern Louisiana University.
Early 1970s also saw the construction of D Vickers, the Athletics Building, and the C.E. Cate Teacher Education Building.
</p>
<p>After years of planning and fundraising, the <a>Southeastern Louisiana University Center</a> was constructed.
An 8000-seat (more if the floor level is used) arena, the University Center hosts all home basketball games and a variety of civic, cultural, and big-name entertainment events.

<p>In October 1986, a group of faculty members launched Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities and sciences.
Since then, Fanfare has become an acclaimed month-long event, drawing nationally and internationally recognized artists and providing recognition for those closer to home.
In addition to providing entertainment for <a>Lake Pontchartrain</a>'s Northshore Area, Fanfare has an educational-outreach program that works closely with local schools.
In October 2005, Fanfare proudly celebrated its 20th anniversary.
</p>
<p>Southeastern&#x2019;s enrollment, continually increasing since its inception, reached an important milestone in 1997, registering over 15 thousand students for the fall semester.
Pervasive professional accreditations, such as accreditation of the College of Business by <a>AACSB</a>, and excellent egress from/to <a>I-55</a> and <a>I-12</a> figure significantly in the increase.
Since 1925 Southeastern has conferred over 50 thousand degrees as of 2009.
</p>
<p>As Southeastern celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2000, the fall semester marked an exciting change as Southeastern implemented screened admissions standards for the first time.
Also during the 2000-2001 academic year, the Village, Fayard Hall, and the Claude B. Pennington, Jr., Student Activity Center were completed.

<p>In May 2001, Southeastern received full approval from the Board of Regents for its first new graduate degree program in more than a decade, an MS in Integrated Science and Technology.
Since then, Southeastern received approval for seven additional programs: MA in Organizational Communications, MS in Applied Sociology, BS in Athletic Training, BS in Health Education &amp; Promotion, BS in Health Studies, BS in Occupational Health, Safety &amp; Environment, and Master of Arts in Teaching.
</p>
<p>In Fall 2003, Southeastern hit a record enrollment of 15,662 students.
Fall 2003 also saw the return of football to Strawberry Stadium, after an 18-year hiatus.
The Lions completed the season 5-7.
</p>
<p>In Fall 2004, Southeastern began implementing portions of the Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criteria, a full year ahead of schedule and before any other schools in the state.</p>
<p>In Fall 2005, Southeastern began its first year under the full Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criterion.
In the same semester Southeastern, which was virtually undamaged by <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>, absorbed some two thousand students whom the storm had displaced from institutions in <a>New Orleans</a>.
North of the War Memorial Student Union is a large fountain constructed and dedicated in 2007 to the victims of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a> and <a>Hurricane Rita</a>; as of 2009 it is the only such memorial fountain in existence.</p>
<p><a>thumb|800px|left|Southeastern's already ample parking was augmented in 2008 by this innovation undertaken by the Student Government Association: A parking garage fitted to Strawberry Stadium.
Initiated by the students and paid for by student fees and parking permits, it is one of only two parking garages on public university campuses in Louisiana.
Juxtaposing the parking garage with the stadium has made the combination especially attractive to the media on game days.</a></p>
<p>A Southeastern alumnus is <a>State Representative</a> <a>Donald Ray Kennard</a>, who has represented parts of <a>East Baton Rouge</a> and <a>Livingston</a> parishes since 1976.
Kennard is also a former president of the Southeastern Alumni Association.

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>Southeastern's major campus media and publications are the <em>Lion's Roar</em> (campus newspaper), KSLU (campus radio station), <em>ByLion</em> (weekly online publication), the Southeastern Channel (local cable channel), and <em>Le Souvenir</em> (official yearbook).</p>
<h3><em>The Lion's Roar</em></h3>
<p><em>The Lion's Roar</em> is the official newspaper of the students of Southeastern Louisiana University.
Distributed on Tuesdays, it is published weekly during regular semesters and monthly during the summer semester.
<em>The Lion's Roar</em> is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern Louisiana University working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs.
<em>The Lion's Roar</em> has been in continuous publication since 1937.</p>
<h3>KSLU</h3>
<p>KSLU began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at Southeastern Louisiana University, operating at 10 watts of power.
Initially the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during the weekends and during the holidays.
Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assessed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the <a>Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a>.
Since that time the station has grown to 3,000 watts, the maximum allowed because of the crowded 88-92&nbsp;MHz band and the university's proximity to Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
</p>
<p>In 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in the South to install a digital touchscreen operating system.
The installation was featured in Broadcast Engineering magazine and visited by radio personnel from across the world.

The broadcast schedule offers a vast array of non-commercial programs which both enlighten and entertain.
Diversity is the strength of KSLU, with offerings including local talk shows, entertainment and sports news, campus and community activities.
</p>
<p>In 1993, an emergency situation room was added utilizing amateur radio equipment purchased with grants from <a>State Farm Insurance</a> and Louisiana Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of <a>Entergy</a>).
During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the Florida parish area.
</p>
<p>In the past, the station produced several political forums which were fed to all public radio stations in Louisiana and to commercial stations via the Louisiana News Network.
</p>
<p>The year 1996 brought another exciting time as KSLU began broadcasting globally via the internet, enabling families of international and out-of-state students to hear live university events.</p>
<h3><em>ByLion</em></h3>
<p><em>ByLion</em> is published weekly online (bi-weekly during the summer session) for the faculty and staff of Southeastern Louisiana University.
This bi-weekly newspaper is very popular among freshman students.
</p>
<h3>Southeastern Channel</h3>
<p>The Southeastern Channel officially hit airwaves July 9, 2002, and less than five years later has already established itself as one of the premier university television channels nationwide.

With high-quality production and programming as its staple, the Southeastern Channel has already won over 40 national and international awards in the past four years, including two Emmy awards, along with multiple <a>Telly</a>, Aurora, <a>Axiem</a>, Videographer, Communicator, and WorldFest International Film and Video Festival Gold Remi awards.
Last year, the Southeastern Channel had eight Emmy nominations; six more than any other television channel (commercial, news, or non-commercial) in Louisiana.
The Southeastern Channel is the first university channel in state history to have won an Emmy.</p>
<p>Led by an international award-winning professional staff, some with decades of experience at the national television network level, the Southeastern Channel produces over 300 hours of fresh, original  programming each week&#x2014;roughly two-thirds of its 24/7 schedule.
Of the 1,000 hours of telecourses airing each year, 900 have been produced using Southeastern faculty.
</p>

<p>The Southeastern Channel recently won four Tellys.
Staffmember Steve Zaffuto won two Bronze Telly's for animation of &quot;Native Sounds&quot; and &quot;Current Events&quot; promos, and Josh Kapusinski won a first-place Silver Telly for animation and a Bronze Telly for editing the &quot;Florida Parish Chronicles&quot; promo.
Josh Kapusinski&#x2019;s &#x201c;Florida Parish Chronicles&#x201d; promo previously won a 2006 Emmy Award in the Suncoast Region.</p>
<p>In the short history of the Southeastern Channel, the channel has provided a valuable training ground for university television students who have worked and studied over 17,000 hours at the state-of-the-art studio production facility.
Here, students have gained great preparation for the television marketplace, and several graduates have landed jobs right after graduation.
The Channel has an extensive  line up of programs like Northshore News, The Big Game, College Night, Southeastern Times, and Indi-Visual.
The Channel is run by talented student workers Nick Elliott (editor/videographer), Danielle Konnecker (anchor/editor), Sujan Pant (Operations Assistant/anchor), Daron Short (editor/videographer).
Southeastern Channel was named best college station in the south.</p>
<p>Southeastern Channel alumni include Randi Rousseau, Christopher Guagliardo, Chris Lecoq, Matt Milton, Nick Brilleaux, Robbie Rhodes, Travis Connelley, Tim Tregle, Tim Tully, John Reis, Allen Waddell, and Chris Coleman.
</p>
<h3><em>Le Souvenir</em></h3>
<p><em>Le Souvenir</em> is the official student Yearbook of Southeastern.
It is published annually and distributed to the student body in the fall semester.
<em>Le Souvenir</em> is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs.
<em>Le Souvenir</em> (French for &quot;the memory&quot;) has been in continuous publication since 1929.</p>
