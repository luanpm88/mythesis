The first building was finished in 1899 [<a>http://www.eiu.edu/~localite/coles/charleston/eiu/oldmain/beginning.htm</a>] and is called Old Main, though it is formally named the <a>Livingston C. Lord</a> Administration Building in honor of EIU's first president, who served from 1899 to 1933.
Built of Indiana limestone in a heavy <a>Gothic revival</a> style with turrets, towers, and battlements, its distinctive outline is the official symbol of the school.
Old Main is one of &quot;<a>Altgeld's castles</a>&quot;, five buildings built in the 1890s at the major Illinois state colleges.
Governor <a>John Peter Altgeld</a> was instrumental in funding the Illinois university system, and he was especially fond of the Gothic style.
Eastern's &quot;Old Main&quot;  and <a>Illinois State University</a>'s Cook Hall are the only schools where the &quot;castle&quot; is not named after Altgeld.
Other original <a>Gothic Revival</a> buildings include <a>Booth Library</a> and Blair Hall.
Blair Hall was restored after a disastrous fire in 2004.
In fall 2008, the university opened the newly constructed Doudna Fine Arts Center,  designed by international architect <a>Antoine Predock</a>.
The  complex houses the music, theatre, and visual arts departments.</p>
