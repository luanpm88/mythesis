<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:LDS Laie Hawaii Temple front view.jpg|left|thumb|The
building of the LDS Church's [[Laie Hawaii Temple]] was a key predecessor to the establishment of BYU&#x2013;Hawaii.]]
The LDS Church was established in the islands in 1850 following the <a>Edict of Toleration</a> promulgated by <a>Kamehameha III</a>, giving the underground <a>Hawai&#x2018;i Catholic Church</a> the right to worship while at the same time allowing other faith traditions to begin establishing themselves.
By 1919, the Church was prominent enough in the area for the church to build a <a>temple</a> in <a>Laie</a>.
Two years after the temple was dedicated then-<a>apostle</a> for the LDS Church <a>David O. McKay</a> stated that the Church would build a school in the area in the future.
In 1951, McKay, now <a>President of the Church</a>, began preliminary plans on the school, and in 1954 ground was broken for the new university.
BYU-H was founded in September 1955 as <strong>Church College of Hawaii</strong> to accommodate the burgeoning LDS population in the <a>Territory of Hawai&#x2018;i</a>.
This was largely a result of McKay's views on both education and strengthening the Church outside of its longtime inter-Mountain West U.S. base.
The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old <a>World War II</a> buildings, with <a>Reuben D. Law</a> as the school's first president.
The school's first buildings were dedicated on December 17, 1958.
The college was at first a two-year college but was reorganized in 1959 to become a four-year college.
By 1961 the College had been granted four-year accreditation by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.
Dormitories, a cafeteria, and other buildings had also been constructed.
Approximately 95% of the student body is LDS.</p>

<h3>Honor code</h3>
<p> [[Image:BYUH mahalo.jpg|thumb|right|A
sign reminds students of [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|BYU-H Honor Code]] standards]] All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an <a>honor code</a>.
Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the <a>Brigham Young Academy</a> and educator <a>Karl G. Maeser</a>.
Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization,&quot; which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and <a>academic dishonesty</a>.
<a>Ernest L. Wilkinson</a> expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards.
(At this time, Wilkinson, as President of BYU, had some authority over BYU&#x2013;Hawaii as well.)
This led to the Honor Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol.
A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff.
Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council.
In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.
One significant difference between BYU's Honor Code and BYU&#x2013;Hawaii's is BYU-H's prohibition of the drinking of <a>kava</a> by students and faculty.
Kava is a traditional Polynesian drink with some drug-like side-effects.</p>
