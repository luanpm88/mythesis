<h2>Centres</h2>
<h3>Canadian Forces Management Development School (CFMDS)</h3>
<p>Founded in 1966, the mission of the CFMDS is to apply management and leadership training and consultation to the defence team.
The CFMDS is housed at the RMC Saint-Jean.</p>
<h3>Non-Commissioned Members Professional Development Centre (NCMPDC)</h3>
<p>The NCMPDC was created on 1 April 2003 and is located at Campus St-Jean.
The courses that are offered at the centre are the Intermediate Leadership Qualification (ILQ), the Advanced Leadership Qualification (ALQ) and finally the CPO1/CWO Chief Qualification (CQ).
All courses include both distance learning and a residential portion.
The distance learning portion lasts 9 or 10 weeks depending on the course and allows the candidates to remain with their respective units.
These courses also prepare the candidates for the residential portion which last three weeks and takes place on the RMC Saint-Jean site.</p>
<p>The NCMPDC courses were created as a result of the NCM Corps 2020, which is the strategic suidance for the professional development of the Canadian Forces Non-Commissioned Members.
[<a>http://www.cda-acd.forces.gc.ca/2020/engraph/ncm/doc/NCMCorps2020_ShortVersion.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>More than a thousand members of the Canadian Forces transit through the NCMPDC each year in order to perfect their knowledge and skills following or before their promotion to the ranks of warrant officer (petty officer 1st class), master warrant officer (chief petty officer second class) or chief warrant officer (chief petty officer first class).</p>
<p>The NCMPDC is a unique professional education establishment within the CF.
It is the only pan-CF school that is for NCM's taught by NCM's and as of September 2007 commanded by an NCM.</p>
<p>Since May 2009, NCMPDC is under the command of the Canadian Forces College (CFC) in Toronto, which offers a similar professional development curricumlum but for officer from the ranks of major to brigadier-general.</p>
<h2>Regular Officer Training Plan(ROTP)/Reserve Entry Training Plan (RETP)</h2>
<p>In addition to a university education, Officer Cadets receive military training, occupation training and second language training and a career after graduation.
The full-time salary includes full dental care, as well as vacation with full pay.
Upon successful completion of ROTP, Officer Cadets are awarded a university degree and granted commissions as Officers in the Canadian Forces.
Normally, graduates serve at least five years with the Canadian Forces.
The application deadline to ROTP is in January for Basic Officer Training in July and admission the following September.</p>
<p>Typically, successful applicants enter the Canadian Military College (CMC) System as an Officer Cadet, where they receive an education that balances academics, leadership, bilingualism and athletics.
If there are more qualified candidates than the CMC System can accommodate or the choice of programme is not offered, such as <a>Nursing</a>, <a>Physiotherapy</a> and <a>Pharmacy</a>, successful applicants would be eligible to apply to any Canadian university where books, lab fees and student fees are covered, and students receive a monthly salary.</p>
<p>Since an application to ROTP is also an application to the Canadian Military College System, all candidates are assessed against an aptitude test, a medical examination, and an interview.
Military Potential is an assessment of Aptitudes, Personality Traits, and the choice of occupation.
Academic Performance is an a candidate's top six most recent marks related to the requirements of the chosen programme.
Officer Cadets are obliged to maintain satisfactory academic and military performance throughout the programme.</p>
<h2>Squadrons of the Cadet Wing</h2>
<p>The undergraduate student body, known as the Cadet Wing, is sub-divided into 3 smaller groupings called <em>Squadrons</em>, under the guidance and supervision of senior cadets.
Squadrons are subdivided into flights and sections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the 1960s, the three squadrons were named Cartier, Mainsonneuve and Champlain.

<h2>Routine</h2>
<p>When they arrive at the Officer Cadets Division, the officer-cadets have already chosen their service.
They are soon separated into three squadrons (Richelieu, Iberville or Tracy).
</p>
<p>The preuniversity programme features modern, diversified teaching methods: workshops, introduction to research methods, laboratories, group projects, oral and multimedia presentations.
The staff provide academic support in the form of workshops, tutorials, and supplementary courses.</p>
<p>The cadets live in the Cartier Building or the Champlain Building and eat in  <a>Dextraze</a> Pavilion (completed in 1993).
The cadets can leave the campus at any time when they do not have classes, study periods or training.</p>
<p>During the week, the daily routine consists of inspection, running, breakfast, classes, sports, and studies.
The officer-cadets attend academic classes and undergo military training.
The <a>military training</a> is in the form of drill, cartography, compass use and three major field exercises each year.
The cadets take roles as cadet squadron commander, second in command (2IC) and section commanders.
Outside classes, <a>bilingualism</a> is promoted by <a>French</a> / <a>English</a> weeks.</p>
<p>On the weekend, with the exception of military training, the students are largely free.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Fall 2007, the federal government reopened the military college at Saint-Jean, which was closed in 1995.
The reopening of RMC Saint-Jean greatly differs from the original college which opened in 1952 and from the RMC of Canada located in Kingston.
The new RMC Saint-Jean emcompasses the Canadian Forces Management and Development School, one of the oldest CF training establishments in the country.
It is also the home to the Non-Commissioned Member Professional Development Centre, which develops the prospective future senior leaders of the Canadian Forces NCM Corps.</p>
<p><a>Micha&#x00eb;lle Jean</a>, Governor General of Canada, inaugurated the Royal Military College Saint-Jean on May 24, 2008, and she presented the new college coat of arms to the Commandant, Colonel Francois Pion.</p>
<p>The Commandant of Royal Military College Saint-Jean reports to the Commander, Canadian Defence Academy (CDA).
RMC Saint-Jean also has its own board of governors.
Cadets at RMC Saint-Jean are issued scarlet uniforms.
The first-year program at RMC Saint-Jean is freeing up beds at <a>RMC</a> allowing more Regular Officer Training Program (ROTP) cadets to attend <a>RMC</a> rather than civilian universities.</p>

<h3>Royal Military College Saint-Jean Museum</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Fort Saint-Jean circa 1775 siege of the fort</a>  <a>thumb|200px|right|Passage of the Richelieu by night</a> <a>thumb|200px|right|Fort Sainte-Th&#x00e9;r&#x00e8;se on Richelieu River</a> The museum is located in Fort Saint-Jean on the campus of the Coll&#x00e8;ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean.
The museum mandate is to collect, conserve, research and display material relating to the history of the CMR, its former cadets and its site, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
The museum contains collections of military memorabilia and military artefacts.
The site has been occupied since 1666 by different garrisons, a shipyard and a military college.</p>
<p>The CMR Ex-Cadet Foundation manages the museum which recognizes more than 325 years (1666&#x2013;1995) of military history at the fortifications located on the Richelieu River.
The flora and centennial trees enhance the site.</p>
<p>The museum was located in the old <a>guardhouse</a> from 1974&#x2013;1998.
The museum was closed from 1998&#x2013;2003 but is now situated in the former Protestant chapel.
The museum is opened Wednesday to Sunday, from 10:00 to 17:00, from May 24 until September 1.
The museum has formed a cooperating association of friends of the museum to assist with projects.</p>
<h2>Features and buildings</h2>
