<p></p>
<p><strong>Maastricht University</strong> (officially abbreviated as <strong>UM</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Maastricht</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>.
Founded in 1976, the university is the second youngest in the Netherlands.
The university's founding name was <strong>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</strong> and was changed into <strong>Universiteit Maastricht</strong> in 1996.
Since 2008 the name is Maastricht University, which the university claims will emphasize the international character.</p>
<p>Maastricht University has over 13,000 students, 39% of whom are foreign students, and over 3,500 employees.
About half of the <a>bachelor</a>'s programmes are fully offered in <a>English</a>, while the other half is taught wholly or partly in <a>Dutch</a>.
Most of the <a>master</a>'s and <a>PhD</a> programmes are in English.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maastricht University was officially established in 1976 to become the eighth public medical school in the Netherlands.
Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the national government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities.
Political leaders in the province of <a>Limburg</a>, most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the <a>Dutch Labour Party</a> and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht.
This new academic institution, Tans argued, would not only be vital to sustain the city's intellectual life, but could also contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in the southernmost part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing serious economic challenges following the collapse of the <a>regional coal mining industry</a>.
</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>By the early 1970s, however, the shortage of medical professionals had all but disappeared and political support for a new medical school waned.
In an unusual decision, the newly established school decided not to await official recognition and to start its educational programme in September of 1974, promising an innovative approach to academic education by adopting a new teaching method known as <a>problem-based learning</a>.
About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year.
By the end of 1975, the <a>Dutch Parliament</a> eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.
The new university, named <em>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</em>, was officially established on January 9th, 1976, when <a>Queen Juliana of the Netherlands</a> signed the university&#x2019;s founding charter at a ceremony in Maastricht.
Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.</p>
<p>Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to expand into other academic fields.
A Faculty of Law was created in 1981, to be followed by an economics faculty in 1984.
In the 1990s, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and the Faculty of Psychology were established.
The university adopted a growth strategy focusing on new academic disciplines, such as knowledge engineering and biomedical studies, and began to develop educational programmes with a distinctly European outlook, such as the European Law School and European Studies.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the university started to establish schools and colleges, such as <a>University College Maastricht</a> (2002), one of the first liberal arts colleges in the Netherlands, and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (2004).
Often created as separate entities within the university, these new departments were later integrated in the university&#x2019;s faculty structure.
</p>
<p>The university was renamed <em>Universiteit Maastricht</em> in 1996 and switched to its current English-language name in 2008.
As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor&#x2019;s programmes, 56 master&#x2019;s programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>Maastricht University  has two campuses: the city centre campus, consisting of a number of historic buildings housing the humanities and social sciences faculties, and the modern Randwyck campus in the southeastern part of the city, which has become the university&#x2019;s centre for the medical, health, psychology and life sciences.
The Randwyck campus includes the university hospital.
Initial plans in the 1960s and 1970s, in line with infrastructural plans at other public universities in the Netherlands, envisaged a functional, single-campus university to be established in the largely undeveloped Randwyck district.
These plans never fully materialized, in part because university administrators and staff considered the UM&#x2019;s presence in the historic inner city to be important asset in attracting prospective students.
Instead, the university developed in a bipolar way with campuses at both sides of the river <a>Meuse</a>.
This bipolarity is symbolized in the university's logo by two triangles pointing to each other.
</p>
<p>In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of <a>Venlo</a>, the Belgian capital of <a>Brussels</a> and the city of <a>Bangalore, India</a>.</p>
<h3>City Centre Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The courtyard at Nieuwenhof, home of University College Maastricht.</a>The university&#x2019;s humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht&#x2019;s city centre, west of the river Meuse, at what can be described as an 'urban campus&#x2019; in the historic inner city.
In addition to teaching and research facilities, the university&#x2019;s executive and administrative centre, the visitors&#x2019; centre and the main branch of the university library are situated here.
Most UM facilities in the city centre are situated in the <em>Jekerkwartier</em> neighbourhood, the southwestern part of the inner city sometimes referred to as Maastricht&#x2019;s university quarter.
Most of the university&#x2019;s inner city properties have official monumental status.
As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed significantly to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht&#x2019;s historic city centre.</p>
<p>The first building to be obtained by the university is the former <a>Jesuit</a> monastery at the Tongersestraat, where in 1974, the newly established medical school started its first academic year.
After the medical faculty moved to the newly constructed university hospital, this large building complex, constructed in 1939, became home to the economics faculty, which is the university&#x2019;s largest academic unit in terms of student numbers.
The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (&#x2018;mensa&#x2019;) and a large lecture hall (&#x2018;collegezaal&#x2019;).
The Faculty of Law is housed in the former provincial government building (<em>Oud Gouvernement</em>) at the Bouillonstraat (Nos.
1-3), which was constructed in 1935 and was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new building in the southeastern part of the city.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The university's executive building at the Minderbroedersberg.</a><a>University
College Maastricht</a> is located in the 15th-century <em>Nieuwenhof</em> convent, situated at the Zwingelput.
The <a>Maastricht Graduate School of Governance</a> has moved into the recently renovated <em>Hustinx Mansion</em> (1882) at the Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa&#x00e7;ade and a covered courtyard.
The only faculty in the inner city which is not located in the <em>Jekerkwartier</em> neighbourhood is the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
This faculty, founded in 1994, was initially housed at the Hustinx building, but currently occupies two historic, adjacent buildings north of the Vrijthof square: <em>Tilly Court</em>, built in 1714 as the residence for the military governor of Maastricht, and <em>Soiron Canon&#x2019;s House</em> (1786), located at the Grote Gracht.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The university library's inner city branch at the Grote Looiersstraat.</a>The university&#x2019;s administrative headquarters is located in the <em>Minderbroedersberg</em> building, which dates back to 1699 and was originally built as a <a>Franciscan</a> monastery, was later used as a prison, and served as the regional court house for most of the twentieth century.
The UM acquired the building to become its administrative head office in 1999.
The Minderbroedersberg and the university&#x2019;s executive organization located here are colloquially referred to as &#x2018;de Berg&#x2019; (the Hill) by university employees for its physical location upon a small hill in the inner city, overlooking several other inner city locations.
The building complex, especially its &#x2018;Aula&#x2019; (main hall), also serves as the university&#x2019;s primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. defenses.
Down the hill, at the former Bonnefanten Convent, is the university&#x2019;s visitors centre, which also houses the student service centre, administrative offices, the university gift shop and a coffee house.
This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent until 1798 and was afterwards for military purposes.
In the twentieth century, the city&#x2019;s main art museum, the <a>Bonnefantenmuseum</a>, was established here.
It became the main branch of the university library in 1979, until the library moved to its current location at the Grote Looiersstraat.
</p>
<p>The library building at the Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and after serving as the city&#x2019;s <a>poor house</a> for a few years, it was transformed into a military hospital which it remained until the 1920s.
Later, the building housed the city&#x2019;s public library until 1999, when it moved to its new location in the modern Ceramique district.
The building was then acquired by the UM.
After major renovation and expansion works, which included a new entrance at the courtyard, the university library relocated here in 2003.</p>
<h3>Randwyck Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Randwyck district in the southeastern part of Maastricht.</a>The
Randwyck campus, developed since the 1970s, has become the centre for the university&#x2019;s medical and life sciences.
The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the sprawling university hospital, which moved from its original location in the western part of Maastricht to its current site in Randwyck in 1992.
The main university buildings, some of which are physically connected to the hospital, were built in the 1990s.
Most sites have been constructed along the Universiteitssingel, the area&#x2019;s eastern thoroughfare running parallel to the A2 highway.
The medical faculty, the first to move to the Randwyck district, merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences in 2007 to become the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences.
The other faculty currently housed at Randwyck is the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience.
The university library's Randwyck branch is located at Universiteitssingel 50.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, when it became clear that the university would not relocate to Randwyck in its entirety, the city decided that the area would become a business district.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the city approved several large infrastructural projects, such as the new provincial government building along the river Meuse and the MECC convention centre, as well as the construction of office buildings and a small residential area in the district.</p>
<p>In 2008, local <a>housing association</a> Servatius began construction for a campus project entitled 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital.
The ambitious project, designed by Spanish architect <a>Santiago Calatrava</a>, would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space.
The project was criticized early on for its environmental impact as a result of its abundant use of copper.
Soon after the start of construction, it became clear that the projected costs of the campus, estimated at &#x20ac; 165 mln, were unrealistic.
Servatius, having failed to secure additional investments, came under heavy political pressure and was forced to put the project on hold in May 2009.
In November 2009, the housing association announced that it had cancelled the campus project with immediate effect, as continuation would impair its ability to carry out its principle function to provide social housing in Maastricht.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>As is common in the Netherlands, Maastricht University's teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of <a>faculties</a>.
Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges.
The names of organizational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university&#x2019;s organizational hierarchy.
In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed School of Business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.</p>
<p>Faculties are governed by a faculty board, headed by a dean.
The dean has overall responsibility for policy and management at the faculty.
Each faculty has a faculty council, a representative body the members of which are appointed for annual or biannual terms on the basis of elections by the faculty&#x2019;s staff and students.
Faculty councils have a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the faculty&#x2019;s teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.
In addition to the faculty boards and faculty councils, other bodies may be created within faculties for advising or consultation purposes.</p>
<p>At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a President, a Vice-President and a Rector.
The Executive Board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities.
The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, performs functions similar to those of faculty councils.
The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.</p>
<p>Additional services at the university are provided by a number of central service centres, such as the university library, the language centre and the university catering department.</p>
<h3>Tuition and Financial Assistance</h3>
<p>Tuition fees at Maastricht University vary, depending on nationality and programme of study.
Regular tuition fees for public universities in the Netherlands are determined annually by law.
Maastricht's tuition fees are therefore similar to those at other Dutch public universities.
Regular tuition fees currently amount to &#x20ac; 1,672 annually for both bachelor's and master's programmes.
Under European regulations, regular tuition levels are also applicable to foreign students from the <a>European Economic Area</a>, which includes all <a>European Union</a> member states.
Tuition for students from non-EEA countries is &#x20ac; 8,500 annually for bachelor's programmes and &#x20ac; 12,000 annually for master's programmes.
The University is currently considering an increase in tuition fees for the academic year 2011/2012.
A plan to introduce an institutional fee of &#x20ac; 950 for students at University College, which would be used to pay for scholarships and to maintain the College's overall quality standards, was shelved after criticism from staff and students.
</p>
<p>Dutch students are eligible for national student grants and loans, administered by the Dutch government.
International students normally are not eligible for student grants, but students from EEA countries are usually eligible for loans to cover tuition fees.
Unlike several other Dutch universities, Maastricht University is not in the US Department of Education list of approved schools for US student aid (FAFSA) funding purposes.
UM administers several university-wide scholarship programmes for international students, including the UM High Potential Scholarships, UM Company Scholarships and Friends Make the Difference Scholarships.
Annually, the top 3% of UM students with the highest overall grades are awarded a full refund of their tuition.
The Limburg University Fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the UM, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets.
A special fund was created to support students from Southeast Asian countries hit by the 2004 tsunami.</p>
<p>As is common in the Netherlands, Ph.D. candidates ('promovendi') at Maastricht University typically are not considered students and accordingly do not pay tuition.
Instead, they have the rank of junior members of the academic staff.
Such Ph.D. candidates are employed by the university or faculty on full-time, four-year contracts with regular, entry-level wages and employee benefits.
Ph.D. appointments usually involve teaching responsibilities and limited administrative duties.</p>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<h4>Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</h4>
<p>The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences offers two bachelor programmes, seven undergraduate minors, eight postgraduate programmes, and has a Graduate School for Ph.D. students.

<h4>School of Business and Economics</h4>
<p>The Maastricht University School of Business and Economics is currently accredited by <a>EQUIS</a> (<a>press release</a>), <a>AACSB</a> (<a>press release</a>) and <a>Association of MBAs</a> (AMBA).
This <a>Triple Crown accreditation</a> has only been achieved by 48 other business schools, including RSM Erasmus University, INSEAD, IMD, FGV(Brazil), and the London Business School.
Students from the Maastricht University School of Business and Economics have also successfully participated in the case competitions at <a>McGill University</a> (<a>MMICC</a>) and the <a>University of Southern California</a> (USC) in 2006 (<a>website</a>).
In 2007, the university was once again invited and participated at CBS Case Competition ([<a>http://www.casecompetition.com</a>]).</p>
<h4>Faculty of Law</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Faculty of Law, located at the former provincial government building.</a>Maastricht
University&#x2019;s Faculty of Law was founded in 1981.
It started with a programme in Dutch law, designed in line with UM&#x2019;s problem-based learning principles.
Ninety students enrolled in the first year.
The Faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof, which is currently home to the University College.
With the number students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location at the Bouillonstraat in 1990.
This building complex, the former seat of the provincial government, consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices.
The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the Feestzaal.
The Faculty celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2011.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the Faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focuses on European, comparative and international law.
The programme is taught partly in English.
A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007.
It is the first English-language bachelor&#x2019;s programme in law in the Netherlands.
The Faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff.
It offers four bachelor&#x2019;s (<a>LL.B.</a>) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, a Dutch-language ELS and an English-language ELS.
In addition, the Faculty offers seven master&#x2019;s (<a>LL.M.</a>) programmes and three advanced master&#x2019;s programmes, many of which are taught in English.</p>
<p>In research, the Faculty has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law.
The Faculty participates in two national research schools: the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, which focuses on European, international and transnational legal questions in both private and public law.
The Faculty is also home to several research institutes.
In 1991, the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO) was founded, followed by the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights in 1993.
The Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht (Centre for European Parliamentary History and Constitutional Development), the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI) and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI) were established more recently.</p>
<h4>Faculty of Humanities and Sciences</h4>
<p>The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>University College Maastricht</a> (UCM)</li>
  <li>Department of Knowledge Engineering (DKE)</li>
  <li>International Centre for Integrated Assessment and Sustainable Development (ICIS)</li>
  <li><a>Maastricht Graduate School of Governance</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences</h4>
<p>The Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences started January 1, 2007.
The faculty was the result of a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine.
The Faculty of Medicine was the first Faculty to be established at Maastricht University.
The University was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, although the first medical students began their studies in September 1974.</p>
<p>The Faculty developed into a community with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff), and approximately 1950 medical students.
Since 1992 staff and students are based at the complex of buildings of the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Faculty of Psychology, and the University Hospital (Academic Hospital Maastricht) which opened in 1991.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Health Sciences offered a broad range of disciplines that made the faculty unique.
Not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe.
The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, sickness and health.
By way of research and specific (undergraduate and postgraduate) education, the Faculty of Health Sciences contributed to quality improvement in health care.</p>
<h4>Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience</h4>
<p>Founded in 1995, Maastricht University&#x2019;s Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary angles in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology.
There are three different master programmes with each it specialisations.
The one year master programme psychology offers 6 different specialisations: neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology.
The two year research master in cognitive and clinical psychology offers four different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology and psychopathology.
The master program forensic psychology has no specialisations.
Like all those at Maastricht University, its programmes revolve around Problem-Based Learning (PBL).</p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of <a>problem-based learning</a> (PBL).
According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.
In 1974, Maastricht's newly-established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method.
As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.
</p>
<p>At the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.
A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.
A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual.
Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting.
The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate.
The instructor, typically named 'tutor', plays only a limited role during tutorials.
Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems.
Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.
</p>
<p>Even though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure.
Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used.
As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course.
The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.</p>
<h2>Academic Life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Student housing complex in the city centre, owned by Woonpunt housing association.</a>The
Maastricht University student body is still composed primarily of students from the Netherlands, but UM has a sizable number of international students.
Of the 13,117 registered students in 2008, 39% were of a foreign nationality.
Most foreign students are from European Union member states: 4,794 students, or 37% of the total student body.
Other, non-EU foreign students, amounting to less than 2% of the total number of UM students, came from various countries in Europe (91), Asia (129), Africa (45), North America (33), Central and South America (15), and Oceania (29).
The university attracts a significant number of German students, especially in its economic, European Studies and psychology programmes.
About 800 students annually choose Maastricht as their study abroad destination, while about 1,400 Maastricht students spend one or more semesters at a foreign university each year.
Some 70 nationalities are currently represented at UM. </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Maastricht University's academic staff, which has been growing over the past years, consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46.
The number of support staff members amounts to 1,600, of which about 62% is female.
Nearly 20% of UM's staff members hold a foreign nationality.
About 12% of professors at Maastricht University are women.
Regarding the number of female professors, the university ranks lower than comparable universities in the Netherlands even though the number has been on the increase over the past years.
</p>
<p>Like most other Dutch universities, UM itself does not provide regular student housing.
However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students.
About 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the Maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations Woonpunt, Servatius and Maasvallei.
Some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords.
Most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods.
Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.
Student accommodations are usually rented out unfurnished, but the number of furnished rooms is growing to meet the demands of the increasing number of international master's students in Maastricht.</p>
<p>The university's independent newspaper, <em>Observant</em>, is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university.
It provides news, background articles, columns and educational information in Dutch and English, directed primarily at the university community.
<em>Studium Generale</em>, the university's cultural office, organizes lectures and cultural activities for members of the university community and the general public.</p>
