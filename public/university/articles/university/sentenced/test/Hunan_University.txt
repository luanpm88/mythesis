<p><strong>Hunan University</strong> (), located in <a>Changsha</a>, <a>Hunan</a> province, is one of the oldest and most important national universities in <a>China</a>.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hunan University traces its history back to the <strong><a>Yuelu Shuyuan</a></strong> (<a>Yuelu Academy</a>) founded in the <a>Song Dynasty</a>, originally in 976, over 1000 years ago (&#x5343;&#x5e74;&#x5b78;&#x5e9c;).
<a>Shuyuan</a> (academy) were once two main forms of higher learning school in China, and another form was government-sponsored schools including imperial central school <a>Taixue</a> or <a>Guozijian</a> and regional schools.
Yuelu Academy had no degree-granting mechanism, and no some other features of a Western university.
The Yuelu Academy was a venue for Chinese scholars and their students to meet and study deep issues in broad areas of <a>Confucian Studies</a>.
In 1903 it was changed to be a modern school with the incorporation of the school which was founded in 1897, initially called Shiwu Xuetang and once in 1902 called Hunan Daxuetang (&#x6e56;&#x5357;&#x5927;&#x5b78;&#x5802;) .
The school name Hunan University (&#x6e56;&#x5357;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) was proposed in 1912, and in 1926 <strong>Hunan University</strong> was formed with the merger of three specialized public schools of Hunan.
The Hunan University was later changed for several times.
The name <strong>Hunan University</strong> was again adopted in 1959.</p>
<p>The Chinese calligraph of &quot;Yuelu Academy&quot; was written by <a>Emperor Zhenzong of Song</a> in 1015, and the Chinese calligraph of &quot;Hunan University&quot; was written by <a>Mao Zedong</a> in 1950 as soon as the People's Republic of China was founded.
