<p> <a>200px|thumb|right|The George Lucas Instructional Building was the center of CNTV for many years until its demolition in 2009 after the opening of the new Cinematic Arts Complex</a></p>
<p>The <strong>USC School of Cinematic Arts</strong>, until 2006 named the <strong>School of Cinema-Television</strong> (CNTV), is a <a>film school</a> within the <a>University of Southern California</a> in <a>Los Angeles, California</a>.
It is the oldest and largest such school in the United States, established in 1929 as a joint venture with the <a>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>.
The school offers multiple <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> programs.
For 2006-2007, the school had 865 undergraduates and 653 graduate students.
</p>
<p>The School&#x2019;s founding faculty include <a>Douglas Fairbanks</a>, <a>D.
W. Griffith</a>, <a>William C. DeMille</a>, <a>Ernst Lubitsch</a>, <a>Irving Thalberg</a>, and <a>Darryl Zanuck</a>.</p>
<p>On September 19, 2006, USC announced that alumnus <a>George Lucas</a> had donated US$175 million to expand the film school with a new  facility.
This represented the largest single donation to USC and the largest to any film school in the world.
His previous donations resulted in the naming of two existing buildings after him and his then-<a>wife</a>, though Lucas was not fond of the architecture used in those buildings.
An architectural hobbyist, Lucas laid out the original designs for the project, inspired by the <a>Mediterranean Revival Style</a> that was used in older campus buildings as well as the Los Angeles area.
The project also received another $50 million in contributions from <a>Warner Bros.</a>, <a>20th Century Fox</a> and <a>The Walt Disney Company</a>.
