<p>  The <strong>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona</strong>, or <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong> (<em>see <a>naming</a></em>), is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Pomona</a>, <a>California</a>, <a>United States</a>.
The university is one of <a>two polytechnics</a> in the 23-member <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona began as a satellite campus of the California Polytechnic School (today known as <a>Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>) in 1938 when a completely equipped school and farm in the city of <a>San Dimas</a> were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son <a>Jerry Voorhis</a>.
The satellite campus, initially called the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit, grew further in 1949 when an  <a>horse ranch</a> in the neighboring city of Pomona became part of the school grounds.
The ranch belonged to retired businessman <a>Will Keith Kellogg</a> who had originally deeded it to the <a>University of California</a> in 1932.
Cal Poly Pomona, then known as &#x201c;Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit&#x201d;, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo continued operations under a unified administrative control until they became unaffiliated in 1966.
Cal Poly Pomona has transitioned from an agricultural <a>two-year technical college</a> with an inaugural enrollment of 110 all-men students into a <a>master&#x2019;s university</a> currently offering multiple educational programs in <a>9 academic units</a> while having a <a>coeducational</a> enrollment of over 20,000 students as of fall 2009.
Cal Poly Pomona is one among a small group of <a>polytechnic universities in the United States</a> having a curriculum emphasizing the study and application of <a>science</a>, <a>technology</a>, <a>engineering</a>, and <a>mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>Once known strictly as a commuter school, in recent years Cal Poly Pomona has undertaken an effort to increase its academic standings while also evolving into a more traditional university.
The university has raised admissions standards, increased on-campus student residences, built new facilities and expanded <a>its undergraduate research opportunities</a>.
Its sports teams are known as the <a>Cal Poly Pomona Broncos</a> and play in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> as part of the <a>California Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (CCAA).
The Broncos sponsor 12 varsity sports and have won 14 NCAA national championships.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>In addition to its official names of &quot;California State Polytechnic University, Pomona&quot; and &quot;Cal Poly Pomona&quot;, the university is commonly referred to by other names.
Among local residents, it is often called by the shortened form &quot;Cal Poly&quot;, which does not fully distinguish it from its sister CSU campus in San Luis Obispo.
Cal Poly Pomona has rejected such usage for official university documents.
and &quot;Cal State Pomona&quot;.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Events leading to the foundation of present-day Cal Poly Pomona began with the demise of the Voorhis School for Boys in <a>San Dimas, California</a> and its acquisition by the California Polytechnic College (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo or Cal Poly S.L.O.) in 1938.</p>
<p>Cal Poly S.L.O. had originally been founded as a <a>vocational</a> <a>high school</a> in <a>San Luis Obispo, California</a> when California Governor <a>Henry Gage</a> signed the Polytechnic School Bill on March 8, 1901.
Voorhis School was established in 1928 and provided <a>elementary schooling</a> for underprivileged boys.
Its founder Charles B. Voorhis and <a>headmaster</a> <a>Jerry Voorhis</a> maintained the school opened throughout the worst years of the <a>Great Depression</a> but persistent economic pressures forced them to transfer control to Cal Poly S.L.O.
Hence, Voorhis School became the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit and its educational offerings were raised to the same level as Cal Poly S.L.O.&#x2019;s &#x2013;then a two-year college.
The entire horticulture program was moved to the new satellite campus and the two units operated as one institution spanning two locations under the leadership of president Julian McPhee.</p>
<p>During <a>World War II</a> most of the student body was called to active duty, enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943.
Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture.
Also in 1957, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the <a>College of Engineering</a>, the second academic unit after the <a>College of Agriculture</a>.
The <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors for the first time to 329 female students.</p>
<p>In 1998, Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to <a>Robert Mugabe</a>.
Mugabe&#x2019;s negative humanitarian record as president of Zimbabwe lead protests from staff, faculty and students ultimately forcing the university to rescind the award.</p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the 1990s and early 2000s, with the construction of the <a>CLA Building</a>, academic facilities, expansion to the <a>Cal Poly Pomona University Library</a> and the addition of programs such as the <a>Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies</a>, the <a>I-Poly High School</a> and <a>U.R. Bronco</a>.
Under president <a>J.
Michael Ortiz</a>, Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment.
Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the <a>late-2000s recession</a> has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and the introduced a mandatory <a>furlough</a> calendar for most of its 47,000 employees.
Cal Poly Pomona&#x2019;s financial endowment declined in value from $33.7 million in fiscal year 2007 to $27.6 million in 2009.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona is situated in <a>Pomona, California</a>, a largely suburban city part of the <a>Los Angeles Metropolitan Area</a>.
The city of Pomona is located in the eastern portion of <a>Los Angeles County</a> and borders the neighboring county of <a>San Bernardino</a> to the east.
The university&#x2019;s  campus make it the second largest in the <a>California State University</a> system, a figure which includes various facilities scattered throughout <a>Southern California</a> such as a  ranch in <a>Santa Paula, California</a>,  at Spadra Ranch, and the <a>Neutra VDL Studio and Residences</a> in <a>West Los Angeles</a>.
In addition, the main Pomona campus is home to a 31-hectare (0.31 km2) <a>ecological reserve</a> known as the Voorhis Ecological Reserve.</p>
<p>Although part of the <a>Los Angeles metropolitan area</a>, the university is in close proximity to two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the <a>Inland Empire</a> and <a>Orange County</a>.
The university has a local-serving area, defined as an geographical region surrounding the campus, roughly bounded by the <a>San Gabriel Mountains</a> to the north, the city of <a>Chino Hills</a>, <a>Interstate 605</a> to the east, and <a>Interstate 15</a> to the west.
Cal Poly Pomona's campus buildings vary in age and style from the <a>Mission Revival</a> Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House (suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of <a>Southern California</a>) built in the 1920s; the modernist box-like portion of the <a>library</a> completed in 1969; to <a>contemporary</a> dormitories, engineering, science and library-expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century.
Leisure and recreational locations include a Rose Garden dating back to the Kellogg Ranch years, a  Japanese Garden built in the Summer of 2003 and designed by <a>landscape architecture</a> professor emeritus <a>Takeo Uesugi</a>, and the Kellogg House designed by prominent architect <a>Myron Hunt</a> (who also designed the <a>Rose Bowl</a> and <a>The Huntington Library</a>).
Kellogg&#x2019;s House features grounds which were initially landscaped by <a>Charles Gibbs Adams</a> At the center of the campus and atop Horsehill is the <a>Collins College of Hospitality Management</a> and <a>Kellogg West</a>, a hotel and conference center and home of the <a>Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch</a>, a facility run by students and faculty.
At the north edge of the campus is the <a>Voorhis Ecological Reserve</a>, which serves as a <a>wildlife corridor</a> and home to <a>Coastal Sage Scrub</a> and <a>Coast Live Oak</a> trees.
Contrasting some of this architecturally prominent facilities, there are various <a>portable building</a>s on campus which are used to accommodate the growing population of recent decades.
Cal Poly Pomona houses the <a>International Polytechnic High School</a>; a college preparatory high school housed entirely in portable buildings and located on what used to be a parking lot.
As of June 2008, <a>financial audit</a>or <a>KPMG</a> valued Cal Poly Pomona's <a>capital asset</a>s at $307.9 million <a>US Dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona's dominant landmark is a <a>futurist</a>-style administrative facility known as the <a>CLA Building</a> which was designed by <a>Antoine Predock</a> and opened in 1993.
The building&#x2019;s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped &#x201c;skyroom&#x201d; atop its eight-story tower ) has become a symbol of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the <a>Hollywood</a> borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as <em><a>Gattacca</a></em> and <em><a>Impostor</a></em>.
Nevertheless, the CLA Building has been suffering from various problems since its completion.
The building suffers from water leakage, and connections and beams at the building do not meet California earthquake safety standards.
CLA Building is located atop the <a>San Jos&#x00e9; Hills Fault</a> and its structural stability has been put to question in the event of a major earthquake as it holds the second-highest seismic &#x201c;risk score&#x201d; of all <a>CSU</a> buildings with as score of 72.94/100.
The building needs so much work and investment to overcome its major flaws that university officials have contemplated razing it.</p>
<h3>Academic and research facilities</h3>
<p>The <a>W.
K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center</a> is an academic and research facility serving one of the 22 terms and conditions to the donation of the Kellogg ranch by maintaining Kellogg&#x2019;s purebred <a>Arabian horse</a>s and their breeding program.
Another academic facility highlighting the Kellogg legacy is the Horse Stables (also known as University Plaza) which houses a small research library specializing in equine studies along with offices for student services and various campus organizations such as the annual <a>Cal Poly Rose Float</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent academic buildings, standing centrally located within the core campus, is the  <a>Cal Poly Pomona University Library</a>.
This central library houses over 3 million items and serves as the most important center for scholarly pursuits on campus.
Built in 1961, the library underwent a major renovation and expansion completed in the summer of 2008 at a cost of over $46 million dollars.</p>
<p>Conceived in 1995 by then University President, Bob H. Suzuki, and initially financed by <a>NASA</a> and the <a>Economic Development Administration</a>, the <a>Innovation Village</a> is a  public/ private partnership research/ business facility at the southern edge of the campus.
Later phases were jointly developed by real estate development firm <a>Trammell Crow</a>.
Major tenants include the <a>American Red Cross</a>, <a>Southern California Edison</a>, and the <a>NASA</a> Commercialization Center.
It's mission is to act as a bridge between academic research and private industry.
The project is currently at the halfway mark of building and leasing  of entitled building space.
Once complete, it is estimated that the project would employ 2000 to 3000 people and provide half a billion dollars of economic benefits to the local, regional and state economies.</p>
<h3>Campus sustainability</h3>
<p>The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus.
In November 2007 Cal Poly Pomona became a signatory member of the <a>American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment</a>.
Among other things, this committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution's electric consumption from <a>renewable sources</a>.
The university is also a member of the <a>California Climate Action Registry</a>.
and lists on <em><a>The Princeton Review</a>'s</em> <em>Guide to 286 Green Colleges</em>.</p>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona's institute for sustainability education is the <a>Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies</a>.
The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research in the areas of sustainable technology and agriculture.
As an example of <a>Cradle to Cradle Design</a>, it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing an environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students.
The center is part of <a>Agriscapes</a>, a  research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste.
Agriscapes is home of the <a>Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch</a> which sells locally and campus grown foods and products.
The Cal Poly Pomona campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California <a>ethnobotany</a> garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as <a>BioTrek</a> which provides environmental education to all academic levels.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p> Cal Poly Pomona is one of <a>two polytechnics</a> in the 23-member <a>California State University</a> system.

<h3>Housing</h3>
<p></p>
<p><a>left|thumb|Residential suites</a></p>
<p>With a housing capacity of 3,600 students, Cal Poly Pomona boasts the fifth largest housing system in the <a>California State University</a>.
There are three styles of <a>residence halls</a> on the Cal Poly Pomona campus.
The first to be built are the six residential halls located on University Drive.
The four older red-brick halls are named <em>Alamitos</em>, <em>Aliso</em>, <em>Encinitas</em>, and <em>Montecito</em> and provide room for 212 students each.
The remaining two gray halls were constructed later and consist of <em>Cedritos</em> and <em>Palmitas</em> and have room to accommodate 185 students each.
The University Village apartments and Campus Suites offer apartment-style living to non-freshman students as an alternative to the campus dormitories.
About 52% of first-year students and 12% of all undergraduates live in college housing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Suites&quot; are the product of more recent on-campus residential developments.
Phase I of the construction of the suites, housing 420 students, completed in 2004 and a second phase is set to open in 2010.
The total on-campus population is 3,200 (as of 2009), but will grow to over 3,822 after the Phase II of the Residential Suites are completely opened in summer 2010, making it one of the largest student housing programs in the California State University system.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce commuting and raise academic standards, starting on the 2010-2011 academic year, freshmen from outside the Tier 1 Local Admissions area (the area roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains and Chino Hills to the north and south and the 15 and 605 freeways to the east and west), will be required to live on campus.
