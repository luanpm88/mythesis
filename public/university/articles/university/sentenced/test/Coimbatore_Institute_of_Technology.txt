<a>Morarji Desai</a> the former Prime minister of India laid the foundation for CIT.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Coimbatore Institute of Technology was founded in the year 1956 by Prof P. R. Ramakrishnan, son of a wealthy Industrialist, after completing a brilliant academic career at the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) and <a>Sloan School of Management</a> in the USA.
He was also one of the earliest Indian to graduate from MIT.
The trust was formed under the name V. Rangaswamy Naidu Educational Trust with the noble aim of disseminating knowledge in the fields of science, engineering and technology to the student community.
The philanthropic founders envisioned a unique professional learning order with special emphasis on  industrial training.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Institute is located in one of the city's busiest road, <a>NH-47</a> ( Avinashi Road ).
The proximity of the college to the roadways, railways and airways is one of the added advantage of the students.</p>

CIT offers 10 Under Graduate Academic Programmes and 7 Post Graduate Academic Programmes in addition to M.S. and Ph.D. Research Programmes.
As part of the invaluable service rendered to the society by V. Rangaswamy Educational Trust, the CIT Sandwich Polytechnic College was started in 1961.
Presently, 6 Engineering Diploma Programmes are  offered by the Polytechnic in various engineering disciplines.
The  National Board of Accreditation has accredited the Mechanical Engineering (Sandwich) and Mechanical Engineering diploma programmes.
Dr.<a>A.P.J.Abdul Kalam</a>, then President of India was the chief guest for the CIT Golden Jubilee Celebrations.</p>
<h2>Autonomy</h2>
<p>The Institute, under <a>Bharathiar University</a>, was granted autonomous status by  UGC  and Government of <a>Tamil Nadu</a> with effect from the Academic year 1987-88.
The Institution is currently an autonomous  institution under Anna University.
The purpose of autonomy is to provide freedom for the institution to design its own curriculum and evaluation system to produce high quality engineers suitable to meet the current  challenges of the industry and society.
The syllabi are restructured and improved involving senior faculty of the institute, experts in various fields of specialisation and practicing professional engineers from industry.
The revision is based on the feedback from the industry, employers, faculty, students and the current status of technology.
A substantial qualitative development in the students' attitude, basic improvement in discipline, better student-staff interaction and higher employability of the graduates are some of  the key benefits of autonomy.</p>
