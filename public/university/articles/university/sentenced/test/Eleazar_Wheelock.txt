<p> <strong>Eleazar Wheelock</strong> (April 22, 1711 &ndash; April 24, 1779) was an American <a>Congregational</a> minister, orator, educator, and founder of <a>Dartmouth College</a>.</p>
<p>He was born in <a>Windham, Connecticut</a> to Ralph Wheelock and Ruth Huntington.
He is the great-grandson of the first teacher of the first free school in the United States (see <a>Dedham, Massachusetts</a>), <a>The Rev. Ralph Wheelock</a>.
In 1733, he graduated from <a>Yale College</a> having won the first award of the Dean Berkeley Donation for the distinction in classics.
He continued his theological studies at Yale until he was licensed to preach in May 1734, and installed as pastor of the Second Congregational Church of Lebanon, Conn. in February 1735.
He served as their minister for 35 years.
On April 29, 1735, he married Sarah Davenport.
He participated fully and enthusiastically in the <a>Great Awakening</a>, which had begun to sweep the <a>Connecticut River Valley</a> around the time of his graduation from Yale.
He was one of its greatest proponents in Connecticut, serving as the &quot;chief intelligencer of revival news&quot;.
</p>
<p><a>Wheelock, Vermont</a> is named in his honor.
It is located in <a>Caledonia County, Vermont</a>.</p>
<h2>Christian Missionary Work</h2>
<p>In 1743, he took in a student named <a>Samson Occom</a>, a <a>Mohegan</a> who knew English, and had been converted to <a>Christianity</a> in his childhood.
Wheelock's success in preparing Occom for the ministry encouraged him to found a school in Lebanon for Native American Indians, with the purpose of instilling, in the boys, elements of secular and religious education, so that they could return to their native culture as missionaries.
The girls were to be taught &quot;housewifery&quot; and writing.
The school was to be supported by charitable contribution.
His plans to educate the young Native American students in his school, which was called the Moor's Charity School, located on the Lebanon town green, did not progress well however - many of his students became sick and died while some turned profligate and in other ways failed to successfully pursue the charter of missionary work.</p>
<h2>Establishment of Dartmouth and presidency</h2>
<p>He eventually decided to enlarge the school and add a college (for the education of whites in the classics, philosophy, and literature) and began to search for another location for the schools.
Wheelock obtained a charter from <a>King George III</a> on December 13, 1769.
<a>Samson Occom</a> and the British Board of Trustees headed by <a>Lord Dartmouth</a> opposed the addition of the college, and despite (or because of) Lord Dartmouth's opposition, Wheelock named the college <a>Dartmouth College</a>.
<a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a> was chosen for the site, and in 1771, four students were graduated in Dartmouth's first commencement, including Wheelock's son <a>John</a>.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Eleazar Wheelock died during the <a>Revolutionary War</a>, on <a>April 24</a>, <a>1779</a>.
He is buried in Hanover.
His writings include &quot;Narrative of the Indian School at Lebanon.&quot;</p>
<p>During World War II a <a>Liberty Ship</a> (Maritime Hull Number 0038) was named for Rev. Wheelock.
This was a C-2 cargo ship outfitted to carry 550 troops.
It participated in the Normandy Invasion and is frequently mentioned  in the book <em>The Far Shore</em> by American author Max Miller.</p>
