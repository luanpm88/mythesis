<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Jackson Male Academy was founded in 1823 just after West Tennessee was opened for settlement .
Only five years earlier in 1818 was the land purchased from the <a>Chickasaw</a> Indians.</p>
<p>In 1907, Dr. T. T. Eaton, a trustee of Southwestern Baptist University, left his 6,000 volume library to the college.
Eaton was a former professor of Union University at Murfreesboro, where his father, Dr.
Joseph H. Eaton, was a former president.
</p>
<p>Southwestern soon changed its name to Union University in honor of the Eatons and others from Union at Murfreesboro who had impacted Southwestern as faculty, administrators, trustees, and contributors.
</p>
<p>In 1925 the Tennessee Baptist Convention secured a charter that vested the rights, authority, and property of Union University in the Tennessee Convention.
This charter included the election of the University&#x2019;s trustees.
Two years later, the Convention consolidated Hall-Moody Junior College at Martin (1900&#x2013;1927) with Union University.
</p>
<p>In 1948 the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted Union University accreditation.
</p>
<p>In 1962 Union developed a nursing program with the assistance of <a>Jackson-Madison County General Hospital</a> at the request of local physicians.</p>
<p>In 1975 Union moved from downtown <a>Jackson, Tennessee</a>, to a new campus located near the Highway 45-Bypass in north Jackson.</p>
<h3>The Craig and Barefoot Administrations</h3>
<p>During President Robert Craig (1967&#x2013;85) and President Hyran Barefoot's (1987&#x2013;1996) administrations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>enrollment increased from fewer than 1,000 students to more than 2,000; </li>
  <li>the Penick Academic Complex was enlarged several times; </li>
  <li>additional housing units were erected; </li>
  <li>and the Blasingame Academic Complex (1986) and the Hyran E. Barefoot Student Union Building (1994) were constructed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Union operated an Extension Center in the Memphis area.
From 1987-95, Union offered the degree-completion program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN track) in Memphis.
At that time there were over 300 graduates of this program.</p>

Those supercells were responsible for at least 32 deaths (courtesy of NWS Nashville)</a></p>
<p> On February 5, 2008, at 7:02 p.m.the university was struck by an <a>EF4 tornado</a>, with winds between 166&#x2013;200 miles  per hour.
The tornado destroyed eighteen <a>dormitory</a> buildings and caused over $40 million dollars worth of damage to the campus, which  suffered a direct hit rendering almost 80% unlivable.
None of the approximately 1,800 students on  campus at the time were killed.
David Dockery, the president of the University, said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm convinced-nobody will ever convince me otherwise-that God's angels were unleashed to come as minstering spirits to protect those students in the most precarious of situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>51 students were taken to Jackson-Madison General Hospital.
While most students were released after being treated, nine were kept overnight.
Some students were trapped for hours while emergency crews worked to rescue them.
A total of 31 buildings received damage of varying degrees.
The devastation captured nation wide attention and was featured by <a>CNN</a>, <a>Fox News</a> , the <a>New York Times</a>  and numerous regional news outlets.
<a>Secretary of Homeland Security</a>, <a>Michael Chertoff</a>, <a>FEMA Director</a>, <a>R.
David Paulison</a> and Governor <a>Phil Bredesen</a> all visited the campus after the disaster.</p>
<p><a>The Commercial Appeal</a> reported that due to extensive damage, the campus would not reopen until February 18. <a>Lambuth University</a>, a rival area university, reportedly offered to open its dormitories to displaced Union students.
The congregation of Englewood Baptist Church, which owns the Old English Inn in Jackson, voted unanimously to open the Inn to Union students.
The church's move will accommodate almost three hundred students until December 2008.
The University also expected that around 200 students would be housed in the private homes of Union faculty, staff and friends.</p>
<p>It was the second time in just over 5 years that the campus was hit by a tornado.
On the evening of November 10, 2002, during the <a>Veterans Day Weekend tornado outbreak</a>, the school was struck by an <a>F1 tornado</a>, with winds of approximately 100 miles  per hour, which did approximately 2 million dollars worth of damage to the school.
There were no serious injuries.
Union president David Dockery stated that the February 5, 2008 tornado was about fifteen times as bad at the 2002 tornado.
The damage caused by the February 5th tornado was estimated at $40 million.</p>
