<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tracing its roots to 1897, TIU formed in the late-1940s as the result of a merger of three schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A school run by the Swedish Evangelical Free Church, founded in 1897 in <a>Chicago, Illinois</a>, initially as a 10-week Bible course and then growing into the Swedish Bible Institute of Chicago and finally becoming the Swedish Department of Moody Bible Institute and Seminary</li>
  <li>A three-year Bible school, the Norwegian-Danish Bible Institute and Academy, founded in 1910 by the Norwegian-Danish Free Church, established in <a>Rushford, Minnesota</a> and later moving to <a>Minneapolis</a> and becoming Trinity Seminary and Bible College</li>
  <li>The Evangelical Free Church Bible Institute and Seminary, established in Chicago in 1925.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 1949, the Minneapolis-based school moved to Chicago and the unified schools became known as Trinity Seminary and Bible College.
In 1961 the school moved to a new campus in <a>Bannockburn, Illinois</a> and a year later was renamed <a>Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</a> (TEDS) and Trinity College.
The school grew from an enrollment of 51 in 1961 to 1,400 in 1990.
In 1995, TEDS became part of Trinity International University, along with Trinity College in Deerfield, Illinois, and Trinity College in Miami.
In 1997 Trinity Law School, located in Santa Ana, California, was incorporated into Trinity International University and the Trinity Graduate School was founded.</p>
