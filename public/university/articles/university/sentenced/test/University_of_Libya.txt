<p>The <strong>University of Libya</strong> () was a <a>Libya</a>n <a>university</a> established in 1955 and disestablished 1973, at which time its colleges were split between the new University of Benghazi (later <a>Garyounis University</a>) in <a>Benghazi</a> and the new University of Tripoli (later <a>Al Fateh University</a>) in <a>Tripoli</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|The former &quot;Al Manar&quot; Royal Palace in central Benghazi, was the university's first campus.</a>
Despite its difficult economic situation, the Libyan government decided to found a university in 1950s.
For that purpose, it sent its delegates in 1955 to <a>Egypt</a> and met prime minister <a>Gamal Abdul Nasser</a>, and ask for borrowing some lecturers working there.
The Egyptian government agreed, and promised to pay  the salaries of the four borrowed lecturers for four years.</p>
<p>A royal decree, issued in December 15th 1955, decided the founding of the university, and the starting point was the Faculty of Literature in <a>Benghazi</a>, and the royal palace &quot;Al Manar&quot;, from which King <a>Idris I of Libya</a> declared its independence in December 24th 1951, was assigned to be the campus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The next step was of course to extend the university and establish new faculties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty of Science, <a>Tripoli</a>, 1956.</li>
<li>Faculty of  Economics, <a>Benghazi</a>,1957.</li>
  <li>Faculty of Law, <a>Benghazi</a>, 1962.</li>
<li>Faculty of Medicine, <a>Benghazi</a>, 1970.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Islamic University of Mohammed ben Ali es <a>Senussi</a> at <a>Al Bayda</a> was subordinate to University of Libya.</p>
<p>On 6 October 1968, a celebration was made at site of the new campus at Garyounis vicinity, <a>Benghazi</a>, because of its founding.
The celebration was attended by King <a>Idris I of Libya</a>, <a>Wanis al-Qaddafi</a>, the prime minister, and of course Abdel Moula Dughman, President of the university.</p>
<p>In August 1973 the university split to form two new universities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Tripoli Campus formed the University of Tripoli.</li>
<li>The Benghazi and al Bayda campuses formed the University of Benghazi.</li>
</ul>
<p>After 7 April 1976 both universities have been renamed: University of Tripoli to <a>Al Fateh University</a>.
University of Benghazi to <a>Garyounis University</a>.</p>
<p>Al Bayda campus formed a new independent university named <a>Omar Mukhtar University</a>.</p>
