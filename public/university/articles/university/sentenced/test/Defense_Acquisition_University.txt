<p>The <strong>Defense Acquisition University</strong> (DAU) is a <a>United States</a> military training establishment that trains and enables the 133,103 military and civilian <a>Department of Defense</a> personnel in the fields of acquisition, technology, and logistics, including leadership and program management.
DAU serves the members of the Defense Acquisition Workforce and their defense industry counterparts and recently celebrated the one millionth graduate.</p>
<p>DAU's mission is to provide a global learning environment to support a mission-ready Defense Acquisition Workforce that develops, delivers, and sustains effective and affordable warfighting capabilities.</p>
<p>DAU aims to impact acquisition excellence through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Acquisition certification and leadership training</li>
  <li>Mission assistance to acquisition organizations and teams</li>
  <li>Online knowledge-sharing resources</li>
  <li>Continuous learning assets</li>
  <li>Strategic workforce planning</li>
</ul>
<p>The DAU vision is to enable the Defense Acquisition Workforce to achieve the right acquisition outcomes.</p>
<p>The Defense Acquisition Workforce is responsible for spending billions of dollars each year on systems, services, and supplies to support the warfighter.
The Defense Acquisition Workforce has an even greater need to be a motivated, well-educated, and highly trained workforce.</p>
<p>To ensure a mission-capable workforce, DAU has implemented the AT&amp;L Performance Learning Model (PLM).
The elements of the PLM&#x2014;training courses, continuous learning, mission assistance, and knowledge sharing&#x2014;give the Defense Acquisition Workforce the right training and tools to positively impact the acquisition outcomes of our defense programs.
</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong>  The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) requires Defense Acquisition Workforce members to be certified for the position they hold.
DAU offers training courses for all Defense Acquisition Workforce members in 14 career fields and at three certification levels.
Through DAU&#x2019;s Core Certification and Core Plus training courses, the workforce can fulfill the training requirements needed to achieve the certification required by DAWIA.
DAU uses innovative approaches to impact all learners and learning styles as they work to complete their certification training.
In FY09, there were: &#x2022; 6,479,014 hours of training (22 percent increase over FY08) &#x2022; 193,967 graduates (26 percent increase over FY08) &#x2022; 154,399 online graduates (30 percent increase over FY08) &#x2022; 39,568 classroom graduates (10 percent increase over FY08)</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Learning</strong> DAU&#x2019;s Continuous Learning Center (CLC) places cutting-edge learning modules on critical acquisition topics at the fingertips of the Defense Acquisition Workforce whenever and wherever they want.
With these modules, DAU is able to deliver the newest initiatives and latest policy changes as well as refresh the workforce&#x2019;s skills.
The continuous availability of these modules conveniently and quickly helps the workforce meet their continuous learning requirements and positively impacts job performance.
In FY09, there were: &#x2022; 236 continuous learning modules (CLMs) available in the online DAU CLC &#x2022; 494,568 completions of CLMs (48 percent increase over FY08).</p>
<p><strong>Mission Assistance</strong> DAU&#x2019;s multi-disciplinary faculty teams with acquisition organizations to help positively influence acquisition outcomes.
Mission assistance extends services beyond the classroom and into the workplace.
From major defense acquisition programs to smaller acquisition teams, DAU is able to provide advice, consulting support, rapid-deployment training on new initiatives, or training targeted to address the mission needs of acquisition field organizations.
Through the mission assistance program, DAU is able to impact acquisition outcomes by helping to solve program and technical issues.
In FY09, there were: &#x2022; 577 consulting, targeted training, and rapid-deployment events (49 percent increase over FY08) &#x2022; 492,521 consulting, targeted training, and rapid-deployment contact hours (17 percent increase over FY08)</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong> By combining people and information, ideas are easily shared.
DAU has been doing this formally for years through coursework and consulting efforts.
But to expand the impact, information and ideas must be shared informally.
DAU does this through a variety of knowledge sharing assets.
Impacting the Defense Acquisition Workforce outside the classroom through increased access to information enhances job performance and improves acquisition outcomes.
In FY09, there were: &#x2022; 696,701 contact hours on the Defense Acquisition Portal (DAP) (59 percent increase over FY08) &#x2022; 540,270 contact hours on the Acquisition Community Connection (ACC) (109 percent increase over FY08)</p>
