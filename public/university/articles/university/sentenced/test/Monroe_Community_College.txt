<p><strong>Monroe Community College</strong> is a two-year college of the <a>State University of New York</a>, located in <a>Monroe County, New York</a>.
The college has two campuses, one in the <a>town of Brighton</a> and another, the Damon City Campus, in the <a>City of Rochester</a>.
The College also encompasses the Applied Technologies Center, programs at the Monroe County Public Safety Training Facility, and has courses online and at four extension sites in East Rochester, Greece, Spencerport, and Webster.
It was founded in 1961.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1961, local physician Dr. Samuel J. Stabins recognized the need to prepare students to work in local hospitals and health care facilities, and thus MCC was founded.
On September 9, 1962, the doors of MCC&#x2019;s original campus swung open and welcomed 720 students.
Three years later, in June 1965, MCC became the first college in the nation to receive accreditation within three years of its founding.</p>
<p>Through the years, MCC has continually grown in degree programs, educational initiatives and facilities to meet the community&#x2019;s diverse needs.
The College also serves seventh through 12th graders in pre-collegiate programs, and incorporates community activism (service-learning) into its courses.
MCC embraces diversity and inclusion, offering activities and programs to enhance the personal and professional development of faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>To date, MCC has served more than a quarter of a million people.
Within the past several years, MCC has welcomed the additions of the Louis S. and Molly B. Wolk Center for Excellence in Nursing and the PAC fitness and recreational facility to help meet evolving educational needs of people throughout our region.

<h2>Academics</h2>

<p>Of the approximately 41,000 students who take classes through Monroe Community College annually, more than 65 percent are under 25 years old, and more than half are women.
The majority of students are enrolled in certificate and degree programs.
In addition, the college trains the area's workforce through open enrollment and corporate training programs, serving small to mid-size employers such as Melles Griot and large employers including <a>Kodak</a> and <a>Xerox</a>.</p>
<p>Many students opt to take a &quot;2+2&quot; transfer program, in which they enroll in a program to earn their <a>associate Degree</a> in two years with the intent of transferring to a college or university &#x2014; primarily the <a>University of Rochester</a>, <a>Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Saint John Fisher College</a>, <a>Roberts Wesleyan College</a>, <a>SUNY Geneseo</a>, <a>SUNY Brockport</a>, <a>Nazareth College</a>, or the <a>Eastman School of Music</a> &#x2014; to complete a <a>bachelor's degree</a>.</p>
<p>Graduates of MCC have moved on to more than 100 different schools.
In 2005, 2,680 people graduated from the college.
Of those who transferred to another college, 62 percent chose one of the region's four-year colleges and universities.
Of those graduates who enrolled at MCC to prepare for a career, 89 percent stayed in the greater Rochester area and found work in business, communications, technology and health care.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Students maintain a regular <a>newspaper</a>, The Monroe Doctrine, which includes both a bi-weekly print version and an online version which can be accessed at [<a>http://www.monroedoctrine.org</a>].
The <a>radio</a> station (closed circuit/web feed only) is also student operated and there are 57 student clubs and organizations for students to participate in.</p>
<p>The Student Association, of which all currently enrolled student life fee-paying students are members, is governed by the Brighton Campus Student Government Association (SGA) and the Damon Campus Student Events and Governance Association (SEGA).
These governing bodies promote the general welfare of the student body, provide programs of educational value to the college community and promote, within the college, a spirit of harmony among students, administration, staff and faculty.
These two governing bodies work closely together to actively engage students from both campuses in the life of MCC.</p>
<p>The Campus Activities Board (CAB) is the events organization at MCC.
The CAB sponsors on-campus activities such as Freestyle Fridays, Fall Fest and Spring Fling.
CAB also brings in Guest Speakers to present on various current issues facing students.</p>
<p>MCC offers smart classrooms, interactive <a>videoconferencing</a> capabilities, eight electronic learning centers (the largest of which has 100+ workstations), the Warshof Conference Center (open to the public), dental and <a>massage therapy</a> clinics, fitness and dance studios, a new <a>synthetic turf</a> field, and a variety of dining and restaurant options on campus.
Brighton Campus is one of the few college campuses that is nearly completely enclosed.
The Brighton Campus, along with the Applied Technologies Center on West Henrietta Road, is completely wireless; while most of the Damon City Campus is equipped with '<a>hotspot</a>s.'
In 2008, a .
athletics facility &#x2013; the PAC Center &#x2013; was added to the Brighton Campus.</p>
<p>Unlike most U.S. community colleges, MCC provides <a>residence halls</a> for on-campus living.
In 2003, the Alice Holloway Young Residence Halls opened on the Brighton Campus.
Today, four more buildings have been added: Alexander Hall, Canal Hall, Pioneer Hall, and Tribune Hall.
Each housing facility is equipped with modern technology services and has a strong sense of community.</p>
<h3>Community programs</h3>
<p>In addition to academics, MCC supports programming that provides solutions to community needs.
They provide a G.E.D program, a support network for parents and infants called 292-BABY, and an AmeriCorps program called <a>Rochester AmeriCorps</a>.</p>
