<p><a>thumb|The distinctive towers of Antioch's Main Building</a> <strong>Antioch College</strong> is a private, independent <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Yellow Springs, Ohio</a>, <a>United States</a>.
It was the founder and the flagship institution of the six-campus <a>Antioch University</a> system.
Founded in 1852 by the <a>Christian Connection</a>, the college began operating in 1853 with politician and education reformer <a>Horace Mann</a> as its first president.
Between 1921 and 2008, the college's educational approach blended practical work experience with classroom learning, and participatory community governance.
Students received <a>narrative evaluations</a> instead of <a>academic letter grades</a>.
In June 2007, the University&#x2019;s <a>Board of Trustees</a> announced that Antioch College would be suspending operations as of July 2008.
Antioch University transferred the assets, including the college campus, a $20 million endowment, Glen Helen and the Antioch Review, to Antioch College Continuing Corp. in 2009 for $5 million.
Since then, Antioch College has raised nearly $17 million from alumni in its quest to reopen in fall 2011.</pre>
<p>  </pre>
<p>Antioch College is a member of the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>, which mediated negotiations for transfer of the College from Antioch University to the ACCC, and the North American Alliance for Green Education.
It was also formerly a member of the <a>Eco League</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On October 5, 1850, the <a>General Convention of the Christian Church</a> passed a resolution stating &quot;that our responsibility to the community, and the advancement of our interests as a denomination, demand of us the establishing of a College.&quot;
The delegates further pledged &quot;the sum of one hundred thousand dollars as the standard by which to measure our zeal and our effort in raising the means for establishing the contemplated College.&quot;
The Committee on the Plan for a College was formed to undertake the founding of a college, and make decisions regarding the name of the school, the <a>endowment</a>, fundraising, faculty, and administration.
Most notably, the committee decided that the college &quot;shall afford equal privileges to students of both sexes.&quot;
The Christian Connection sect wanted the new college to be sectarian, but the planning committee decided otherwise.</pre>
<p>Despite its enthusiasm, the Christian Connection's fundraising efforts proved insufficient.
The money raised before the school opened failed to cover even the cost of the three original buildings, much less create an endowment.
The [[Unitarian Church]] contributed an equal amount of funds and nearly as many students to the new school, causing denominational strife early on.
The first curriculum focused on [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[mathematics]], [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[science]], and offered electives in [[art]], [[botany]], [[pedagogy]], and [[modern languages]].
Tuition was $24 a year, and the first graduating class consisted of 28 students.
Although the founders planned for approximately 1,000 students, enrollment only exceeded 500 once in the 19th century, in 1857.</pre>
<p>[[Image:Horacemann.jpg|thumb|200px
|[[Horace Mann]], Antioch's first president.]]</p>
<p>One notable character in Antioch's history is <a>Rebecca Pennell</a>, Mann's niece, who was one of the college's ten original faculty members.
She was the first female college professor in the United States to have the same rank and pay as her male colleagues.
Her home, now part of the Antioch campus and called Pennell House, served in recent years as community space for several of Antioch's student-led independent groups.</pre>
<p>In 1859, Mann gave his final commencement speech, including what became the college's motto: &quot;Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.&quot;
Mann died in August and was initially interred on the Antioch College grounds.
The next year, he was reinterred in <a>Providence</a>, <a>Rhode Island</a>, next to his first wife.</p>
<p>The original founders gave no consideration to the question of whether Antioch should admit students of color, neither forbidding nor explicitly allowing it.
The associated [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] admitted two [[African American]] girls during the mid-1850s, an action one trustee responded to by resigning and removing his own children from the school.
His opinion was apparently the minority one, though, as the African American students were not withdrawn.
In 1863, Antioch trustee John Phillips proposed a resolution stating &quot;the Trustees of Antioch College cannot, according to the Charter, reject persons on account of color.&quot;
The resolution passed with nine trustees in favor and four opposed.
However, the college remained nearly all white until after [[World War II]], when the school undertook a minority recruitment program.</pre>
<p>Antioch College was insolvent the day it opened and faced financial difficulties from its first years.&lt;!--Please source assertion that college faced financial difficulty due to enrolling women and people of color.--&gt;
From 1857 to 1859, Antioch ran an annual deficit of [[US$]]5,000, out of a total budget of [[US$]]13,000.
In 1858, Antioch was bankrupt.
Mann died in 1859 and the college was reorganized, but deficits continued.
Hill resigned in 1862 due to increasing financial troubles, sectarian conflict between Christian Connection and Unitarian trustees, and his election as president of [[Harvard]].
In 1862, the college was closed until finances improved and remained closed until after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</pre>
<p>In 1865, the college reopened, now administered by the Unitarian Church.
The financial health of the college seemed improved, as the Unitarians had raised a <a>US$</a>100,000 endowment in the space of two months.
The endowment was originally invested in government bonds and later in real estate and timber.
The investment income, while performing well, was still insufficient to maintain the college at the high level desired by the trustees.
Some of the principal was lost to foreclosures during the [[Long Depression]], which began in 1873.</p>
<h3>1900-1945</h3>
<p>The turn of the century saw little improvement in the college's finances.
In 1900 faculty made between <a>US$</a>500 and $700 a year, very low for the time, and the president was paid $1,500 a year.
In contrast, Horace Mann's annual salary had been $3,000 more than forty years prior.
Enrollment did increase significantly under the presidency of [[Simeon D. Fess]], who served from 1906 to 1917.
In 1912 he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], and served three of his five total terms while also acting as president of Antioch.</pre>
<p><a>World War I</a> had little effect, good or bad, on the college and though some people contracted influenza during the <a>Spanish flu</a> epidemic, there were no deaths.
In February 1919, the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] attempted a peaceful takeover of the college, offering to raise an endowment of [[US$]]500,000 if Antioch would serve as the official national college of the YMCA.
The YMCA proposal was received positively by the college's trustees and enacted by a unanimous vote, and Grant Perkins, a YMCA executive, assumed the college's presidency.
By May, Perkins had resigned, reporting that he was not prepared to raise the necessary funds.
He presented his plan for &quot;practical industrial education&quot; to the trustees, which accepted the new plan.
Antioch closed for a third time while the curriculum was reorganized and the co-op program developed.
In 1920, Morgan was unanimously elected president and, in 1921, the college reopened with the [[cooperative education]] program.</pre>
<p><a>thumb|Arthur E. Morgan, circa 1921.</a></p>
<p>The early co-op program was not required; students could enter as traditional students or cooperative education students.
Despite this, by the 1935 academic year, nearly 80% of the student body had chosen the cooperative program.
Students initially studied for eight-week-long terms alternating with eight-week-long work experiences.
Male students generally took apprenticeships with craftsmen or jobs in factories; female students often served as nursing or teaching assistants.
In 1921, when the program was inaugurated, fewer than 1% of available co-op jobs were located outside of Ohio, but this had grown to about 75% within 15 years.</pre>
<p>Morgan constructed a new board of trustees of prominent businessmen, replacing many of the local ministers and adding a new source of income.
<a>Charles Kettering</a> alone contributed more than $500,000 to Antioch.
These kinds of major donations by board members and their friends totaled more than $2 million for the decade.
Kettering and other major patrons hoped to create a model institution that would create potential business administrators with students &quot;trained for proprietorship.&quot;
The college declined an offer from [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)]] to finance the college completely if Antioch would leave rural Yellow Springs, re-establish itself on NCR grounds in Dayton, and rechristen itself the National Cash Register College.</pre>
<p>The college enrolled no <a>black</a> students from 1899&#x2013;1929 and only two from 1929&#x2013;1936 (neither graduated), so it is unknown how <a>racial discrimination</a> among employers affected the co-op program.
While Antioch itself had no religious quotas (elsewhere common until the 1940s), many employers discriminated against <a>Jew</a>s, a fact that limited the number of Jewish students at Antioch.
The program suffered for available positions during the <a>Great Depression</a>, prompting the college to employ many students at industrial jobs on campus.
Antioch was one of the first historically white colleges to actively recruit black students.
Antioch was also the first historically white college to appoint a black person to be chair of an academic department, when Walter Anderson was appointed chair of the music department.</pre>
<p>In the 1950s Antioch faced pressure from the powerful <a>House Un-American Activities Committee</a> and faced criticism from many area newspapers because it did not expel students and faculty accused of having <a>Communist</a> leanings.
College officials stood firm, insisting that freedom begins not in suppressing unpopular ideas but in holding all ideas up to the light.
The school, including professors and administration, was also involved in the early stages of the <a>American Civil Rights Movement</a> and was a supporter of <a>free speech</a>.
</p>
<p>In 1965, Dr. <a>Martin Luther King Jr.</a> gave the commencement speech.</p>
<p>Antioch became increasingly progressive and financially healthy during the 1960s and early 1970s under the Presidency of Dr. James P. Dixon.
The student body topped out at around 2,400 students, the college owned property all over Yellow Springs and beyond, and the college grew throughout the decade.
It began to appear in literary works and other media as an icon of youth culture, serving, for example, as the setting for a portion of <a>Philip Roth</a>'s novel, &quot;<a>Portnoy's Complaint</a>&quot; and an <a>S.J. Perelman</a> satire, &quot;To Yearn Is Subhuman, To Forestall Devine.&quot;
At this time, Antioch became one of the primary sources of <a>student radicalism</a>, the <a>New Left</a>, the anti-<a>Vietnam War</a> movement, and the <a>Black Power</a> movement in the region.
The town of Yellow Springs became an island of liberal and progressive activism in southern Ohio, an otherwise very politically conservative region.</p>
<p>In many instances, the environment of the school spurred its students to activism.
<a>Eleanor Holmes Norton</a>, future congressional delegate for <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, recalled her time at Antioch as one &quot;when the first real action that could be called movement action was ignited&quot;, according to an interview now available in the National Security Archives.</pre>
<p>The 1970s saw the college continue to develop its reputation as a source of activism and progressive political thought.
Several graduate satellite schools around the country, under the <a>Antioch University</a> name (with the college as a base), were established as well, including the <a>McGregor School</a> (now known as Antioch University McGregor located on a new campus in Yellow Springs that opened September 2007).
<a>Antioch University New England</a> was the first graduate school offshoot in 1964.
The university campuses are located in <a>Keene, New Hampshire</a>; <a>Seattle</a>, <a>Washington</a>; <a>Los Angeles, California</a>; and <a>Santa Barbara, California</a>.
</p>
<p>After considering 337 candidates in its search, <a>William Birenbaum</a> was named as president of Antioch College in April 1976.
The chairman of the search committee called him a &quot;courageous and charismatic personality&quot; who is an &quot;experienced chief executive with a strong track record in crisis-type settings.&quot;
By 1979, <em><a>The New York Times</a></em> described tensions on campus due to the school's dire financial crisis and that Birenbaum's &quot;pugnacious and often abrasive style had offended many Antiochians&quot;, with enrollment at the <a>Yellow Springs, Ohio</a> campus dropping from 2,000 to 1,000 during the 1970s.
Birenbaum implemented cost-cutting measures including a reduction in the number of satellite campus programs nationwide from 30 down to under 10 and changed its name to <a>Antioch University</a> as a parent for its multiple campuses.
By November 1980, <em>The New York Times</em> was able to report in a headline of an article about the college that &quot;A Streamlined Antioch Appears on the Way to Survival&quot;.
Birenbaum announced in June 1984 that he would be retiring and Alan E. Guskin of the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Parkside</a> was named to succeed him as of September 1, 1985.</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, under the leadership of Antioch Presidents Alan Guskin and Bob Devine, Antioch's enrollment figures and financial health improved, though college enrollment never surpassed 1,000 students.
The campus underwent renovations and many buildings that had been boarded up were repaired and reopened, including South Hall, one of the college's three original buildings.</p>
<h4>The Sexual Offense Prevention Policy</h4>
<p>In 1993 Antioch became the focus of national attention with its &quot;Sexual Offense Prevention Policy.&quot;
Under this policy, <a>consent</a> for sexual behavior must be &quot;(a) verbal, (b) mutual, and (c) reiterated for every new level of sexual behavior.&quot;
This policy was initiated after two <a>date rape</a>s reportedly occurred on the Antioch College campus during the 1990-91 academic year.
A group of students formed under the name &quot;<a>Womyn</a> of Antioch&quot; to address their concern that sexual offenses in general were not being taken seriously enough by the administration or some in the campus community.
Advocates of the policy explain that the original &quot;Sexual Offense Policy,&quot; as it was then called, was created during a couple of late-night meetings in the campus Womyn's Center, and that &quot;this original policy was questionable.
It was not legally binding, no rights were given to the accused, and it called for immediate expulsion of the accused with no formal process.&quot;
and a media frenzy ensued, one that arguably garnered more attention to Antioch than anything since the <a>student strike</a> of 1973.
The policy was often ridiculed by the mainstream American news media that fall, even becoming the butt of a <a>Saturday Night Live</a> sketch, entitled &quot;Is It Date Rape?&quot;
Some media outlets voiced support for the policy.
For example, syndicated columnist <a>Ellen Goodman</a> asserted that most &quot;sexual policy makers write like lawyers in love,&quot; and that, likewise, &quot;at Antioch the authors could use some poetry, and passion.&quot;
But, she was ultimately sympathetic to their goals of leveling the sexual playing field and making students think about what consent means, saying that the Antioch campus &quot;has the plot line just about right.&quot;</pre>
<h3>The 21st century</h3>
<p>In 2000, Antioch College was again subject to media attention after inviting political activist and <a>death row</a> inmate <a>Mumia Abu Jamal</a> and <a>transgender</a>ed rights advocate and Jamal supporter <a>Leslie Feinberg</a> to be commencement speakers.
Graduating students had chosen Jamal and Feinberg to highlight their concerns with <a>capital punishment</a> and the American <a>criminal justice system</a>.
Many conservative commentators criticized the Antioch administration for allowing students to choose such controversial commencement speakers and the college administration received death threats.
Antioch President Bob Devine chose not to overturn the students' choice of speakers, citing the ideals of free speech and free exchange of ideas, and likened the media reaction to the coverage of <a>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s 1965 commencement address.</pre>
<p>In the early 2000s enrollment declined to just over 600 students.
This combined with a declining economy caused Antioch University to institute a &quot;Renewal Plan&quot; in 2003.
The controversial plan called for restructuring Antioch's first year program into <a>learning communities</a> and upgrading campus facilities.
Many students and faculty stated that they were shut out of planning.
Antioch University's Board of Trustees committed to five years of funding for the renewal plan but discontinued this commitment to the college three years into the plan.</pre>
<p>Simultaneously with the announcement of the renewal plan, the University's Board of Trustees announced mandated staff cuts at the college, including the elimination of the Office of Multicultural Affairs.
Student anger over the mandated renewal plan and program cuts led to a student-initiated protest entitled &quot;People of Color Takeover&quot;, which garnered negative media attention.
Partially in response to this, Antioch College created the <a>Coretta Scott King</a> Center for Cultural and Intellectual Freedom in 2006.</pre>
<p>With the implementation of the controversial renewal plan, enrollment dropped from 650 students to 370 in two years, a decline that many feel was a result of the curriculum change mandated by the Board of Trustees.
At an Antioch University Board of Trustees meeting in June 2007 the Board stated that while the college was only in its third year of implementation of the plan they had not raised the funds needed, and that the college would be indefinitely closed at the end of the 2007-08 academic year.
</pre>
<p>Many Antioch alumni and faculty, upset at the prospect of the loss of the college's legacy, began organizing and raising funds in an effort to save the college, keep it open without interruption, and gain greater transparency in its governance.
In August 2007, the college faculty filed suit against the Board of Trustees, charging that the Board was violating various contractual obligations.</pre>
<p>Following a meeting between university and alumni representatives in August 2007, the Board of Trustees approved a resolution giving the Alumni Board until the October 2007 trustees' meeting to demonstrate the viability of an Alumni Board proposal to maintain the operations of the College.
Despite initially stating he would remain until December, Antioch president Steve Lawry abruptly stepped down as president on September 1, 2007.
The role of president was turned over to a three-person group, comprising the Dean of Faculty, Director of Student Services, and Director of Communications.
While no reason for Lawry's immediate departure was given, it has been reported that he was forcibly ousted by the Board of Trustees.
In response to this reported ousting, the faculty gave Antioch University Chancellor Toni Murdock a [[vote of no confidence]].</pre>
<p>A story about Antioch's closing in <em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> detailed the uncertain future of some faculty and staff members, along with the town of Yellow Springs, following suspended operations at the college.
One professor, who got tenure 28 hours before the college announced its closing, had turned down other jobs in academia to work at Antioch.
The story includes a slideshow showing outdated and crumbling buildings on campus.</pre>
<p>On November 3, 2007, the University Board of Trustees agreed to lift the suspension of the college, which would have seen the college operate continuously rather than closing.
The Alumni Board embarked on a $100 million fundraising drive to build the college's endowment, raising more than $18 million in gifts and pledges by November 2007.
However, major donors balked out of concern that the deal did not make the college sufficiently autonomous from the university, and a group began meeting directly with the university, incorporating as the Antioch College Continuation Corporation (ACCC).
On February 22, 2008, the university issued a press release reinstating the suspension, despite ongoing negotiations with the group.
On March 28, 2008, university trustees rejected a $12.2 million offer from the ACCC, which then offered $10 million for 10 seats on the 19-member board.
On May 8, 2008, university trustees rejected the ACCC's &quot;best and final&quot; offer -- $9.5 million for the college and another $6 million for the graduate campuses in exchange for eight board seats, with an additional four new trustees to be jointly agreed upon by the ACCC and current trustees.
</pre>
<p>The college closed as promised on June 30, 2008.</p>
<h4>Continuation of Antioch College</h4>
<p>The suspension of operations of the College led to a collaboration between the University and its College alumni association to explore a means to separate the College from the University in a manner which preserved the viability of both.
The closure of Antioch College also spurred the creation of the <a>Nonstop Liberal Arts Institute</a>.
Led by former faculty, staff, and students, and with the support of Yellow Springs residents, Nonstop aims to keep the values and mission of the College alive in the midst of its suspension .
Recognizing that any reopening of the College required the cooperation and substantial financial support of alumni, the Board of Governors of Antioch University adopted a resolution on June 8, 2008, requesting that the Alumni Association prepare a plan to bring the College back to vigor and vitality.
Thereafter, the Antioch University Board of Governors and the Board of Directors of the Antioch College Alumni Association publicly announced on July 17, 2008, the creation of a new task force composed of University and Alumni representatives to develop a plan to create an independent Antioch College.
The Alumni Association then delegated its role in the discussions to a limited group of alumni who had incorporated as Antioch College Continuation Corporation (&quot;ACCC&quot;), an Ohio non-profit corporation.
The task force discussions were facilitated in part by the Great Lakes College Association.
As the result of those discussions, ACCC and.</pre>
<p>Antioch University agreed to an asset purchase agreement on June 30, 2009.
That agreement called for the transfer of the College campus and the College endowment to ACCC which would operate the College as an independent corporation with its own fiduciary board of trustees.
As part of the transaction, Antioch University licensed to ACCC an exclusive right to use the name &quot;Antioch College&quot;.
The parties closed on the transfer of assets on September 4, 2009, staff and an interim President have been hired to recruit an entering class for the Fall of 2011.
(reference Associated Press) </p>
<p><a>Mark Roosevelt</a>, formerly of <a>Pittsburgh Public Schools</a>, was hired as the new president in October 2010.
</p>
<h2>Profiles, recognition, and criticism</h2>
<p>Huffington Post recognized Antioch College on its list of <strong>Top Non-Traditional Colleges</strong> alongside Brown, the New School and Wesleyan University, among others.
The editors wrote: &quot;When it was up and running, Antioch provides students with smorgasbord of interdisciplinary majors founded on the basis of the school's &quot;Three C's&quot;: classroom, co-op and community.
Though the school closed its doors in 2008, it will reopen in fall 2011.&quot;</pre>
<p>The <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> college and university rankings classify Antioch College as a third-tier Liberal Arts College.</pre>
<p>Antioch has been regularly included in the guidebook &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot; which declares that &quot;there is no college or university in the country that makes a more profound difference in a young person's life or that creates more effective adults.&quot;</pre>
<p>Less positive opinions include that of <a>George Will</a>, who wrote in response to the college's announced closure that there is &quot;a minuscule market for what Antioch sells for a tuition, room and board of $35,221 &#x2014; repressive liberalism unleavened by learning.&quot;</pre>
<p>During her remarks to the college in 2004 alumna <a>Coretta Scott King</a> stated that &quot;Antioch students learn that it&#x2019;s not enough to have a great career, material wealth and a fulfilling family life.
We are also called to serve, to share, to give and to do what we can to lift up the lives of others.
No other college emphasizes this challenge so strongly.
That&#x2019;s what makes Antioch so special.&quot;</pre>
<p><em>The Twilight Zone</em> TV series includes an episode titled &quot;<a>The Changing of the Guard</a>&quot; that is considered to be &quot;the Antioch episode&quot; for its references to Antioch that include mention of <a>Horace Mann</a> and the school motto.</p>
