<h2>History</h2>

Norbert College was established when Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Dutch immigrant priest from the <a>Premonstratensian</a> abbey of <a>Bern (Netherlands)</a>, founded the college to train young men for the priesthood.
Frances I. Van Dyke, a seminarian, was the first and, at the time, the only student.
