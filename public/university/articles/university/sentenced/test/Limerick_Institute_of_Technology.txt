</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A series of technical colleges, to be known as <a>Regional Technical College</a>s (RTCs) was announced by the Minister for Education, <a>Patrick Hillery</a> in 1963 and the first of the RTCs were opened in <a>Athlone</a>, <a>Carlow</a>, <a>Dundalk</a>, <a>Sligo</a> and <a>Waterford</a> in 1970.
A Regional Technical College for Limerick was cancelled after a <a>National Institute for Higher Education</a> was announced for the city in 1972.
</p>
<p>The Limerick City Vocational Education Committee (VEC) independently planned to build Limerick Technical College and acquired land at Moylish Park to do this.
The college was opened in 1975 and has since developed into the main campus of Limerick Institute of Technology.
In 1980 the VEC established <strong>Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology</strong> (<strong>Limerick CoACT</strong>) to include the newly established <a>Limerick School of Art and Design</a>, the School of Professional Studies, located on <a>O'Connell Avenue</a> and the Limerick Technical College at Moylish Park.</p>
<p>CoACT finally became a Regional Technical College in 1993 and was finally upgraded to <a>Institute of Technology</a> status in 1997, along with the rest of the RTCs.
The Institute awards its own bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees, which were previously awarded by the <a>Higher Education and Training Awards Council</a>.</p>
