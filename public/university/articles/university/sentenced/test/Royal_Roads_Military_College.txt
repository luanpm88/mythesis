<p> <strong>Royal Roads Military College</strong> (RRMC) was a Canadian military college (1940 to 1995) located in <a>Hatley Park</a>, <a>Colwood, British Columbia</a> near <a>Victoria, British Columbia</a>, <a>Canada</a>.
The facility is currently being used as the campus for <a>Royal Roads University</a>, a public university that offers applied and professional academic programs on campus and via distance education.
The centrepiece of the campus is <a>Hatley Castle</a>, constructed in the early part of the 20th century by B.C. <a>coal</a> baron <a>James Dunsmuir</a> for his wife, Laura.
The house had been purchased as a wartime residence for the King, Queen, and their daughters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Hatley Castle</a> The property owned by industrialist James Dunsmuir, along with his mansion Hatley Castle, was acquired by the Dominion Government in 1940.
Designed to support Canada's naval war effort, the facilty began operating in December 1940 as an officer training establishment known as <em>HMCS Royal Roads</em>.
Many of the 600 volunteer reserve officers who underwent training during this time served in the <a>Battle of the Atlantic</a>.
HMCS Royal Roads was used to train short-term probationary Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) sub-lieutenants to serve in <a>World War II</a>.
</p>
<p>In 1942, because of wartime expansion, the <em>Royal Canadian Naval College</em> was established.
In 1947, the facility became known as the <em>RCN-RCAF Joint Services College</em> where <a>Royal Canadian Navy</a> and <a>Royal Canadian Air Force</a> personnel were trained.
The facility changed its name to <em>Canadian Services College, Royal Roads</em> in 1948 where personnel from all three services - the Navy, Air Force, and Army were trained during a two-year program.</p>
<p>In 1968 the college's name was changed to <em>Royal Roads Military College</em>, and in 1975, the college began granting degrees.</p>
<p>The gentlemen cadets of RRMC were not only required to excel in their respective academic fields, but to achieve the standard in the three other components as well, the Second Language Training component, <a>Physical Fitness</a> component and the Military component.
Failure in any of these four components resulted in the <a>officer cadet</a> not being awarded the coveted RRMC degree.</p>
<p>In February 1994, after the end of the <a>Cold War</a> and under the pressure of massive spending cuts from the Government of <a>Canada</a>, the <a>Department of National Defence</a> announced that it would close Royal Roads Military College.
The final class graduated in May 1995.</p>
<p>Hatley Park and former Royal Roads Military College was declared a <a>National Historic Site of Canada</a> in 1995 to commemorate the Dunsmuir family (1908&#x2013;1937) and RRMC (1940&#x2013;1995).
The site was plaqued in 2000 as a Canadian example of an Edwardian park, with gardens, which remains practically intact.
<em>HMCS Royal Roads</em> is a <a>Canadian</a> naval training centre commissioned on 13 December 1940.
This was the first of a series of related institutions to be set up by the <a>Department of National Defence</a> at <a>Hatley Park</a> in <a>Esquimalt, British Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>The name Royal Roads was drawn from geography.
The name refers to an anchorage located in <a>Juan de Fuca Strait</a> between the city of <a>Victoria, British Columbia</a> and Albert Bay.
HMCS Royal Roads was located on a property originally purchased by <a>James Dunsmuir</a> in 1902.
Dunsmuir was a former <a>British Columbian</a> Premier and <a>Lieutenant-Governor</a>.
The <a>Hatley Park</a> Estate originally comprised .
The Dunsmuir family added <a>Hatley Castle</a>, which was completed in 1908.
The Canadian <a>Department of National Defence</a> purchased Hatley Park, almost in its entirety, in 1940, for $75,000.
This sum was roughly the value of the fence surrounding the property.</p>
<p>As Executive Officer, Commander Reginald Amand (Jumbo) Webber D.S.C., C.D. served there till late 1942.
On June 21, 1995, after negotiations with the Department of National Defence and the Government of <a>British Columbia</a>, the British Columbia government passed the Royal Roads University Act, creating <a>Royal Roads University</a>.
The campus is currently leased from the federal government under a $1, 50-year <a>lease</a> agreement with <a>Royal Roads University</a> which was announced in 2001.
The Department of National Defence leases approximately 55 hectares of land for the campus to Royal Roads University, and has entered into a five-year Renewable Management Agreement with the University for the maintenance of the remaining 175 hectares of property owned by the Department of National Defence.</p>
<p>The athletic facilities at Hatley Park included a swimming pool, five <a>tennis</a> courts, two <a>squash</a> courts, three <a>soccer</a> pitches, one rugby field, two ball diamonds, a quarter- mile track, a 6.1&nbsp;km cross country course, jetty and boat house.
Cadets played sports including <a>rugby</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>baseball</a>, scuba diving, <a>track and field</a> and <a>hockey</a>.</p>
