<p> The <strong>State University System of Florida</strong> (<strong>SUS</strong>, or <strong>SUSF</strong> out-of-state) is a system of eleven public <a>universities</a> in the U.S. state of <a>Florida</a>.
As of 2008, over 300,000 students were enrolled in Florida's state universities.
Together with the <a>Florida College System</a>, which includes Florida's 28 <a>community colleges</a> and <a>state college</a>s, it is part of Florida's system of public <a>higher education</a>.
The system is overseen by a Chancellor and governed by the <a>Florida Board of Governors</a>.
</p>
<p>The Florida Board of Governors was created in 2003 to centralize the administration of the State University System of Florida.
Previously Florida's State University System had been governed by the <a>Florida Board of Regents</a> (1965&#x2013;2001) and the <a>Florida Board of Control</a> (1905&#x2013;1965).
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1905, Florida's state institutions were governed by a Board of Education and even earlier variations thereof, reaching back to the <a>Florida</a> Constitution of 1838 wherein higher education and normal education was established, based on grants of land from the <a>U.S. Congress</a>.
From 1905 to 1965, the few universities in the system were governed by the <a>Florida Board of Control</a>.
The Board of Control was replaced by the <a>Florida Board of Regents</a> in 1965, to accommodate the growing university system.
The Board of Regents governed until it was disbanded by the <a>Florida Legislature</a> in 2001, and its authority was divided between the <a>Florida Board of Education</a> (which was given some authority over all levels of public education in the state), and appointed university boards of trustees, which operated independently for each separate institution.
In 2002, Floridians led by <a>U.S. Senator</a> <a>Bob Graham</a> passed an amendment to the <a>Florida Constitution</a> establishing a new statewide <a>governing body</a>, the <a>Florida Board of Governors</a>.</p>
<p>During the 2008-2009 academic year, the State University System enrolled 301,135 total students.
In total 233,772 undergraduates, and 56,872 graduate and professional students..
Each campus maintains its own library catalog and also shares an agreement for library reciprocal borrowing.
The agreement was called the Florida Distance Learning Iniative and was signed on February 9, 1999.</p>
<p>The physical collections are scattered across each of the SUS campuses.
Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed in the main article.
Due to organizational differences, having more libraries does not directly translate into a higher volume of specific collections of materials.</p>
<h2>Tuition differential</h2>
<p>During Florida's 2007 Legislative Session, <a>Governor</a> <a>Charlie Crist</a> signed into law SB-1710 which allowed the <a>Florida Board of Governors</a> to charge Tuition Differential of 40% above and beyond the regular in-state <a>undergraduate</a> <a>tuition rates</a> for the <a>University of Florida</a> and <a>Florida State University</a>.
In addition the <a>University of South Florida</a> was allowed to raise its rates 30% above and beyond the regular in-state undergraduate tuition charges.
This was allowed because these three institutions reached Research Flagship benchmarks that the other universities in the State University System could not achieve.</p>
<p>In 2008, in lieu of receiving increased research funding in excess of $100 million, the Tuition Differential was allowed to now include the <a>University of Central Florida</a> and <a>Florida International University</a>.
These two institutions were allowed to raise their in-state undergraduate tuition rate 30% above and beyond the regular tuition rates.
This legislation ultimately created a multi-tier system for higher education in <a>Florida</a>'s State University System of Florida.</p>
<p>In 2009, Governor Charlie Crist and the <a>Florida Legislature</a> passed an even broader tuition differential for all of the institutions within the State University System of Florida.
The new provision allows for a 15 percent annually tuition increase for in-state undergraduate tuition until they reach the national average.
Governor Crist signed off on the legislation on June 1, 2009.</p>
<p>The expanded tuition differential is not covered by the <a>Bright Futures Scholarship Program</a>, and the stipulation states that 30 percent of the added revenue must go to <a>need-based student financial aid</a>.
This legislation was passed due to severe budget restrains caused by the <a>Florida</a> economy.</p>
