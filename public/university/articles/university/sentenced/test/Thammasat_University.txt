<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Monument of Pridi Banomyong, Thammasat University 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The monument of [[Pridi Banomyong]] at Tha Phrachan Campus]]</p>
<h3>University of Moral and Political Sciences</h3>
<p>Thammasat University began in 1934 as an open university called the <strong>University of Moral Science and Politics</strong> (UMPS; ); this was two years after <a>Siamese revolution of 1932</a> and eighteen years after <a>Chulalongkorn University</a> had been founded.
Thammasat University was the idea of <a>Pridi Banomyong</a>, architect of the 1932 coup and the then <a>Minister of Interior</a>, who drafted the <em>Act of University of Moral and Political Science 1934</em>.
The university was inaugurated on 27 June 1934, and Pridi served as the university's first rector.</p>
<p>The university is a result of the sixth principle of the Khana Ratsadon.
The first announcement of Khana Ratsadon stated they &quot;must provide the people with full education&quot; because people &quot;lack education, which is reserved for royals&quot;.
The desire of students at the School of Law to see their institution upgraded to a university rather than simply a department at Chulalongkorn University also helped Thammasat University become the successor of the Law School.
The property and faculty of the Law School were transferred to University of Moral and Political Science, and the building of the old Law School was the first Thammasat site.
The university moved to Tha Phrachan campus the following year.</p>
<p>When the university opened, 7094 people applied for admission.
At that time Chulalongkorn University was graduating only 68 students a year.
Thammasat initially offered a <a>bachelor's degree</a> with an emphasis on legal studies and previously banned <a>economics</a> and <a>political science</a>, plus a bachelor's degree equivalent diploma in accountancy.
<a>Master's degree</a> courses soon followed in <a>law</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>economics</a>, and <a>doctoral degree</a> courses in law, political science, economics, and diplomacy.</p>
<p>During its early years, the university did not rely on government funding, but instead relied on its low tuition fees and interest paid by the <a>Bank of Asia for Industry and Commerce</a>, in which the university owned 80 percent of the shares.</p>
<p>Under Pridi's leadership, the University became the clandestine headquarter of the <a>Free Thai</a> anti-Japanese underground during <a>the Second World War</a>.
Ironically, the University campus also functioned as an interment camp for Allied civilians, with Thai guards more or less protecting them from abuses by the occupying Japanese.
The internment camp was where the Multipurpose Building now stands.</p>
<h3>Reform</h3>
<p>The <a>coup d'&#x00e9;tat on 8 November 1947</a> marked the end of an era.
Pridi Banomyong left the country and went into exile.
The original Thammasat degree was replaced by specialised departments in 1949, when the Faculties of Law, Political Science, Commerce and Accountancy, and Economics were founded.
The university was forced to sell its bank shares, thus becoming dependent on government funding.
The words <em>and political</em> were removed from its name, and Thammasat was no longer an open university.
A new <em>Thammasat University Act</em> was passed in 1952.
Thammasat added four more faculties during the 1950s and 1960s: Social Administration, Journalism and Mass Communication, Liberal Arts, and Sociology and Anthropology.</p>
<h3>Bloody October protests</h3>
<p>In 1973, Thammasat became the centre of the pro-democracy protest movement that led to the <a>bloody uprising on 14 October</a>.
A large crowd, led by university students, assembled at Thammasat University to protest the arrest of thirteen pro-democracy student activists.
The protest continued for several days before a bloody confrontation took place at the <a>Democracy Monument</a>.
When Thailand's military leaders fled into exile, <a>Sanya Dharmasakti</a>, then Thammasat rector, was appointed as the Prime Minister of Thailand.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|6 October Memorial at Tha Phrachan</a> Three years later, the <a>6 October 1976 Massacre</a> took place on the  Tha Phrachan campus.
The event began with protests against the return of exiled dictator <a>Thanom Kittikachorn</a>.
Violence first appeared on 25 September when two <a>EGAT</a> employees who handed out protest literature in <a>Nakhon Pathom</a> were branded 'communists', beaten to death, and their bodies hung from a wall.
This led to peaceful protests by  labor groups, students, and other activists demanding the expulsion of Thanom.</p>
<p>On 4 October, students staged a play on the Thammasat campus to dramatize the hanging of the protesters in Nakhon Pathom.
Several newspapers printed photographs of the mock hanging, however with one of the students retouched to resemble Crown Prince <a>Vajiralongkorn</a>, implying that the students had committed <a>l&#x00e8;se-majest&#x00e9;</a>.
Uniformed police and enraged right-wing paramilitary groups promptly surrounded Thammasat University.
At dawn of 6 October the police and paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
The mayhem continued for several hours.
Newspaper sources gave the number killed as between 43 and 46, but the actual figure may have been over a hundred, with several hundred more injured.
Many student protesters escaped by jumping into <a>Chao Phraya River</a>, where they were rescued by the sympathetic Royal Thai Navy.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>During the 1980s, Thammasat University built a new campus at Rangsit to house the new Faculty of Science and Technology.
This faculty accepted its first students in 1985.
The Faculty of Engineering opened at Rangsit in 1989, followed by the Faculty of Medicine in 1990.
By the late 1990s, all first years students were studying at Rangsit.
At present almost all undergraduate classes are taught at Rangsit, the exceptions being the international English language programmes.
Graduate degree classes are also still taught at Tha Prachan.
</p>
<p>The Rangsit campus was chosen as one of the venues for the <a>1998 Asian Games</a>.</p>
<p>Thammasat University is a member of &quot;Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange&quot; (<a>LAOTSE</a>), an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia.
It also cooperates with some of the top universities around the globe.
Regional cooperation is maintained with the <a>Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network</a>.</p>
<h2>Seal</h2>
<p>The <a>seal</a> represents the centerpiece of the <a>Democracy Monument, Bangkok</a>, which itself honours the Thai Constitution of 1932.
It is superimposed on a <a>Dharmacakra</a>, or <em>Wheel of Law</em>, symbolising the <a>Dharma&#x015b;&#x0101;stra</a>, the university's name in <a>Pali</a>.
</p>
<p>The university has been honoured with a commemorative 10-<a>baht</a> coin.
The university seal is on the reverse, encircled by the university's name, &quot;70 years&quot;, and 27 June 2547 <a>BE</a> (<a>AD</a> 2004).
The obverse depicts King <a>Bhumibol Adulyadej</a> as a young man dressed as a student.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>Thammasat University has two campuses in <a>Bangkok Metropolitan Area</a>, Tha Phrachan and Rangsit.
There are four regional campuses.</p>
<h3>Tha Phrachan</h3>
<p>: [[Image:TUfromSirirat.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Tha
Phrachan campus from the opposite bank of [[Chao Phraya River]]]]  49 <a>rai</a> (0.078&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) <strong>Tha Phrachan Centre</strong> () is located in <a>Phra Nakhon</a>, <a>Bangkok</a>, bordering <a>Sanam Luang</a>, the <a>National Museum</a>, <a>Wat Mahathat Yuwaratrangsarit</a>, and the <a>Chao Phraya River</a>.
It was the first permanent campus of Thammasat, purchased from the military with public donations in 1935.
The site had originally been part of the <a>Front Palace</a> of the deputy king (formerly the designated heir to the throne).</p>
<p>The symbolic building of the university is the Dome, the original building on Tha Phrachan campus.
It was constructed from four existing military buildings.
The Dome housed Pridi Banomyong's office as well as the command centre of the <a>Free Thai Movement</a> during the <a>Second World War</a>.
Late in the war, when a rising against the occupying Japanese was planned, military weapons were concealed in the attic.</p>
<p>The Tha Phrachan campus played a significant role in <a>the uprising</a> against the military regime on 14 October 1973.
It was also the site of the <a>6 October 1976 Massacre</a>, in which students protesting against the return to Thailand of exiled military dictator <a>Thanom Kittikachorn</a> were murdered by right-wing activists and police.</p>
<p>Eight faculties have their building in Tha Phrachan campus: Law, Political Science, Economics, Commerce and Accountancy, Liberal Arts, Social Administration, Journalism and Mass Communication, and Sociology and Anthropology.
Nowadays, however, only <a>postgraduate programmes</a>, integrated bachelor's and master's programmes, and the English-language international programmes are Tha Phrachan.
Thammasat Tha Phrachan also has a notable Thai Language course for foreigners, taught by professors in the Faculty of Arts.
Tha Phrachan has a football field, a track, a <a>gym</a>nasium, eight libraries, and several <a>cafeteria</a>s.</p>

<p>Sociology and Anthropology was formed as one of the departments of the Faculty of Social Administration, Thammasat University from the initiation of the Dean(1961&#x2013;1965) Professor Major General Buncha Mintarakhin.
His view was that Thailand should have sociologists and anthropologists who contribute to the society by undertaking research which would strengthen the disciplines.
At the time of the department foundation Thai scholars in sociology and anthropology were sparse.
It took several years to recruit qualified members in the academic team.
Subsequently the expanding Department of Sociology and Anthropology became a separate division from Social Administration Faculty in 1976.</p>
<p>The status was then raised to what is today the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology since 1984.
Since the last three decades the Faculty has offered various academic programmes of graduate and post-graduate levels which introduce students to theory and related disciplines.
In the near future the Faculty will also open a PhD programme.
Each degree aims to provide knowledge and understanding of cultural and social mechanism as well as to equip students with ability to analyse the past and present society.
Many graduates undertake further research.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Engineering</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering was founded on August 19, 1989 as the 10th faculty of the university.
Originally formed as a response to governmental initiative to promote the study of science and its related field.
It originally started teaching electrical and industrial engineering in 1990, then expanded its offerings to civil engineering (1992), chemical engineering (1994), and mechanical engineering (1996).</p>
<p>The faculty also has an international department which taught in English and very often mistaken as <a>SIIT</a> (see below) by outsiders.
This special programme is divided into two distinct parts, <em>Twinning Engineering Programme (TEP)</em>, established in 1997, and the <em>Thammasat English Engineering Programme (TEPE)</em>, established in 2000.
The TEP programme is a sandwich programme, two years in Thammasat and two years in a foreign university (currently either the <a>University of Nottingham</a> or <a>University of New South Wales</a>).
Many of the graduates continue their Master&#x2019;s or Ph.D. in prestigious UK universities, such as Imperial, LSE, UCL, Warwick.</p>
<p>The faculty is also known for its teaching excellence and strong research links although their works are not often known.
The faculty has strong ties with both NECTEC and MTEC located in Thailand Science Park.
The faculty also has strong researching ties with Japan particularly and more recently with the <a>University of Karlsruhe</a> in Germany.
Its current dean is Associate Professor Dr. Uruya Weesakul.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Architecture and Planning</h3>
<p>The university had proposed the establishment of a Faculty of Architecture under the Eighth National Higher Education Plan (1997&#x2013;2001) of the Ministry of University Affairs (now Office of the Commission on Higher Education under the Ministry of Education).
However, a Cabinet meeting on February 3, 1998 decided to restrict the establishment of all new departments.
The university then created an Architecture Programme to be autonomous under the Thammasat University Council by its resolution of May 6, 1999.</p>
<p>The programme was approved to be the Faculty of Architecture by a resolution of the Thammasat University Council on October 29, 2001.
Professor Dr. Vimolsiddhi Horayangkura, who had been the programme's director since 1999, was appointed to be the first dean of the Faculty of Architecture.
The faculty offered two more new undergraduate programmes, Interior Architecture and Urban Environmental Planning and Management Program, in the 2002 academic year.</p>
<p>In 2007, the undergraduate program in Landscape Architecture and the graduate program in Interior Architecture were started in response to high market demand for landscape architects and research oriented designers.
In the following year, the school launched the graduate program in Innovative Real Estate Development.
The program will take a leading role in establishing a new interdisciplinary resource that fosters excellence in real estate education and research.</p>
<h3>Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, located in the university's Rangsit Centre, <a>Pathum Thani Province</a>, is a semi-autonomous <a>institute of technology</a> established in 1992.
It offers a range of science, technology and engineering education, as well as related management programmes.
All of them are international programmes, with English language as a medium of instructions.
Although it is an academic unit of the university, and graduates of the institute receive Thammasat University degrees, the institute is self-administered and financed.
The institute enjoys strong links with <a>Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency</a>, <a>Thailand Science Park</a>, national graduate schools (such as <a>JGSEE</a>, <a>TGIST</a>, and <a>TAIST</a>) and many international universities, notably its neighbour <a>Asian Institute of Technology</a>, and a group of Japanese and European universities.</p>
<p>Being a research-led academic institution in nature, from the most recent performance evaluation (Academic Year 2003) by the university, the institute has the highest number of research publications (both in raw quantity and per graduate student heads), compare to other academic units in the university, and when compare to other universities, each SIIT faculty member produces twice the highest value of national range for international journal publications (0.74 vs 0-0.41, academic year 2004).
In 2007, the <a>Thailand Research Fund</a> assessed research outcomes of universities in Thailand, and SIIT ranked as <em>&quot;Very Good&quot;</em> for all three indicators, make it the only engineering school in the country that can achieved this.
The institute is also one of a very small numbers of universities which can secure numbers of Thailand Research Fund's <em>Royal Golden Jubilee grants</em>, considered to be the country's most prestigious research grants for PhD students, for every single year since the programme began in 1998 &#x2014; one of the only three which can secure <em>Engineering discipline</em> grants for every single year.</p>
<h3>Faculty of medicine</h3>
<p>The faculty of medicine was found in 1990 as the 11th faculty of the university and was the 9th medical school of Thailand.</p>
<h3>Pridi Banomyong International College</h3>
<p>Pridi Banomyong International College has been established in 2008 to introduce unique interdisciplinary programs taught in English for both international and Thai students.
Of particular emphasis will be new programs and degrees created in collaboration with leading universities overseas.
The College is named after Professor Dr. Pridi Banomyong, former Prime Minister and founder of Thammasat University, in recognition of his significant role in Thailand and at the university.
On the occasion of the centenary of Dr. Pridi Banomyong's birth in 2000, he was named by UNESCO as one of the world's great personalities of the century.</p>
<p>Bachelor's Degree in Chinese Studies (International Program)</p>
<p>The People's Republic of China is a superpower with great global influence in the fields of economics, politics, arts, and culture.
China has exerted a profound influence on Thai culture, particularly over the past 200 years of Chinese-Thai foreign relations.
Thais, from everyday citizens to those working at the highest levels of government, recognize the importance of China, both in the global sphere and for Thailand specifically.
Given China's importance and the need for China scholars in Thailand, the Pridi Banomyong International College has developed the Chinese Studies International Program.
The purpose of the program is to produce graduates who have both the Chinese language proficiency and the knowledge and understanding of China.</p>
<p>Uniqueness of studying Chinese Studies at Thammasat University</p>
<p>The Chinese Studies International Program at Pridi Banomyong International College is unique in its close relationship with the School of International Studies at Peking University in China.
Students in the program are required to spend at least one semester abroad at Peking University.
Moreover, many of the courses offered by the Chinese Studies International Program at Thammasat are equivalent to courses offered at Peking University, including Global Political Economy in the 21st Century of China, Investment and Trade of language classes in Thailand and study abroad at China's top university, students have the opportunity to study Chinese in full immersion contexts and, especially, in the university which is the first in China and among the tops in the world.
The Chinese Studies program thus responds to the need for China experts at all levels of the labor market, from the local, to the national, or the international level.</p>
<p>The Thai Studies Program</p>
<p>For more than 10 years the Thai Studies program has offered undergraduate students a fascination and in-depth study of the language, society, arts, culture and politics of Thailand.
As a one-year certificate program, foreign students study within five clusters focusing on the social sciences, art and cultures, public health, development and migration.</p>
<p>Students within the program are pricilaged to some of the country's leading scholars.
For example, Dr. Mano Mettanando Laohavanich has two degrees from Harvard University and Oxford University as well as a PhD in Thai studies from Hamburg University in Hamburg, Germany.
The other faculty members are also highly accomplished and have advanced degrees in Asian and Thai Studies.</p>
<p>The Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) is in conjunction with many great educational institutions around the world.
Through the Thai Studies program, university send and receive roughly 100 exchange students each year.
Because Thammasat has an MOU with all the University of California (UC) campuses, the majority of visitors are American.
Students typically take one semester at PBIC, transfer the credits and take the rest of the classes at their home schools.
Students leaving Thailand typically study in America, China or Japan.</p>
