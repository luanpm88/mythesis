<p>  <strong>Middle East Technical University</strong> (<strong>METU</strong>; in <a>Turkish</a>, <em>Orta Do&#x011f;u Teknik &#x00dc;niversitesi</em>, commonly referred to as <em>ODT&#x00dc;</em>) is a <a>public</a> <a>technical university</a> located in <a>Ankara</a>, <a>Turkey</a>.
The university puts special emphasis on research and education in <a>engineering</a> and <a>natural sciences</a>, offering about 40 undergraduate programs within 5 faculties, and 97 masters and 62 doctorate programs within 5 graduate schools.
Over 40% of METU's undergraduate alumni choose to pursue graduate studies.</p>
<p>In the early years immediately following its foundation, METU was temporarily hosted in a small building that previously belonged to the Social Security Office of Retirees in <a>K&#x0131;z&#x0131;lay</a> and another building near the <a>Grand National Assembly of Turkey</a>.
In 1963, the university moved to its current location west of Ankara city center, creating the first university campus of Turkey.
In 1956, the Department of Architecture initiated the first academic program at METU, followed by the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the spring of 1957.
At the start of the 1957&#x2013;1958 academic year, the Faculty of Architecture, the Faculty of Engineering, and the Faculty of Administrative Sciences were established.
In 1959, the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was completed.
The Faculty of Education launched its academic program in <a>1982</a>.

<h3>Graduate schools</h3>
<p>The 5 graduate schools present in METU are responsible for the graduate programs.
Over 40% of METU's students go on to graduate school.
Each academic year, METU hosts over 1,500 regular international students from nearly 80 different countries; and through 168 <a>Erasmus Programme</a> agreements and 182 bilateral exchange and cooperation agreements with universities abroad (e.g. in Central Asia, Middle East, North America, Australia, Far East and Pacific Region), it sends 350 students and receives 300 students and 50 researchers annually., with over one third of the 1,000 highest scoring students in the national university entrance examination choosing to enroll; and most of its departments accepting the top 1% of the nearly 1.5 million applicants., METU ranked as the world&#x2019;s 435th (1st place within Turkey) among 15,000 universities, being the only university from Turkey to get included among the top 500.
Recently, the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> published in September 2010 placed METU at the 183rd position worldwide based on indicators of teaching, research, influence, innovation, and international character, making it one of the two universities from Turkey listed among the top 200 (The other being <a>Bilkent University</a> at number 112)., and as 285th in the field of natural sciences.</p>
<p>The language of instruction at METU is <a>English</a>.
Within the <a>7th Framework Programme</a> (FP7), 33 research projects involve participation of METU, since 2007.</p>
<p>As of 2010, METU has 19 international <a>joint degree programmes</a> with European and American universities at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
The university has completed the evaluation process of Institutional Evaluation Programme (IEP) of the <a>European University Association</a> (EUA) in 2002.</p>
<p>Because of METU's effort to maintain international standards, the Faculty of Engineering was awarded in 1977 the &quot;Silver Badge of Honor&quot; by the <a>UNESCO</a> International Center for Engineering Education and the &quot;Meritorious Achievement Award in Accreditation Activities&quot; by the <a>Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a> (IEEE).
METU was awarded the international <a>Aga Khan Award for Architecture</a> in 1995 for its forestation program.</p>
<p>Being the pioneer institution of the country to connect to the Internet backbone in the early 1990s, METU also manages Turkey's <a>Country Code Top-level Domain (ccTLD)</a> (the &quot;.tr&quot;
domain).</p>
<h3>METU library</h3>
<p>The METU main library has one of the largest collections in <a>Turkey</a>, containing nearly 400,000 books classified according to the <a>Library of Congress Classification</a> (LCC) scheme.
The library subscribes to 1,500 print journals (170,270 volumes) and it provides access to 50,537 electronic journals, 71,256 electronic books, and 66 electronic reference sources.

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|Part of METU campus, as seen from the MM Building ().</a></p>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>METU main campus in Ankara, used by the university since 1963, is the first university campus of Turkey.
It is situated about 20&nbsp;km west of central Ankara and encompasses an area of 11,100 acres (4,500 ha), of which 7,500 acres (3,000 ha) constitute the METU Forest.
Lake Eymir near <a>G&#x00f6;lba&#x015f;&#x0131;</a>, inside the campus, is used by the students and faculty for rowing and recreational activities.
The campus is accessible by several types of public transport, and the construction of METU subway station of the <a>Ankara Metro</a> on the main entrance to the campus (gate A1) is near completion.</p>
<h3>Erdemli campus</h3>
<p>METU <a>Erdemli</a> campus in <a>Mersin</a> on the Mediterranean coast, used by the <a>Institute/Graduate School of Marine Sciences</a> (<em>Deniz Bilimleri Enstit&#x00fc;s&#x00fc;</em>) since 1975, is the first campus of METU out of Ankara.
It is situated about 45&nbsp;km from <a>Mersin</a>.
Campus area is 660,000 m&#x00b2;, close to the shore and surrounded by lemon trees.
The laboratory space is about 700 m&#x00b2;.
METU-IMS Harbor is an important shelter for marine biological diversity on the Mersin coast.
The harbor is the only intact rocky habitat along the long sandy coast.</p>
<h3>Northern Cyprus Campus</h3>
<p>The new METU Northern Cyprus Campus, about 50&nbsp;km west of <a>Lefko&#x015f;a</a> (<a>Nicosia</a>) on the island of <a>Cyprus</a>, admitted its first students during the academic year 2002 - 2003, but the doors were officially opened in Cyprus in September 2005.</p>
<p>Live footage from all campuses can be accessed via <a>METU-CAM</a>, a collection of six webcams in METU main campus, one in METU Northern Cyprus Campus, and one in the Graduate School of Marine Sciences, in Erdemli, Mersin.</p>
<h2>METU-Technopolis</h2>
<p>METU-Technopolis, or METUTECH, is the first <a>science and research park</a> of Turkey.
Founded within the campus, it aims to facilitate the development of companies that conduct substantial <a>research and development</a> to produce high-tech products and services through benefiting from METU's research capacity and information pool.
Priority is given to companies executing research and development work on information technologies, advanced materials, energy, automotive, chemistry, biology and environment technologies.</p>
<p>As of 2009, the METU-Technopolis project employs about 3,300 personnel, approximately 2,700 of which are researchers (86% of the total staff are university graduates, and 23% have MS, MA, or PhD degrees), working within 240 firms.
Around 90% of the firms are <a>small and medium enterprises</a> (SMEs), 65% of these are specialized in <a>information and communication technologies</a>, 25% in electronics, and 15% in other sectors such as aerospace, environment, bio-technology, nanotechnology, and advanced materials., ReSIST, SmeInnov8gate and IP4INNO.</p>
<h2>Student life and culture</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|A view from 17th METU Spring Festival (), May 2003.</a></p>
<p>The student life at METU is marked with activities of student societies, frequent <a>political protests</a>, and festivals.
The <a>Cultural and Convention Center</a> continually hosts a wide spectrum of cultural events and also regular occurrences such as the METU Jazz Days and METU Art Festival.
The event with the largest number of participants is the annual METU Spring Festival, a five day long series of open air concerts and exhibitions held at the main campus.</p>
<p>There are various traits shared by METU students, including the usage of an English&#x2013;Turkish <a>jargon</a> (apparently stemming from the fact that English is the language of instruction) covering academic processes and student life, which reputedly is not liked much by the students of other universities; and the omnipresent word &quot;<em>hocam</em>&quot; (meaning &quot;<em>my teacher</em>&quot;), which is used by METU students to address anyone from bus drivers to senior faculty members.
Underneath this phrase lies the philosophy that everyone has something to learn from each other.</p>
<p>The main campus has dormitory capacity for nearly 6,000 students who benefit from the shopping center, banks, post office, and a wide variety of sports facilities, including gymnasiums, tennis courts, basketball and football fields, jogging trails, olympic-size indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor swimming pool.
Some of these are:</p>
