<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Bandung Institute of Technology</strong> (, abbreviated as <strong>ITB</strong>) is a state, <a>coeducational</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Bandung</a>, <a>Indonesia</a>.
Established in 1920, ITB is the oldest <a>technology</a>-oriented university in Indonesia.
</p>
<p>The University prides itself on its reputation as one of the country's centers of excellence in science, technology, and art.
ITB was considered the top choice among Indonesia's high school students in 2006 and has been credited as one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia, together with <a>University of Indonesia</a> and <a>Gajah Mada University</a>.
</p>
<p><a>Sukarno</a>, the first president of the Republic of Indonesia, earned his engineering degree in <a>civil engineering</a> from ITB.</p>
<p>The university cultivates professional and social activities by supporting its <a>students' union</a>s, the student government councils that exist in every department.
Each students' union has its own distinctly designed jacket that, among other traditions, serves as part of its member identity.
There are also a number of student activity units/clubs supporting ITB student interests in rounding out their educational experience.
It is not uncommon that the students and alumni are identified by the clubs to which they belong (or used to belong) at ITB, in addition to their class year and major.</p>
<p>The university is a member of <a>LAOTSE</a>, an international network of leading universities in <a>Europe</a> and <a>Asia</a> exchanging students and senior scholars.</p>
<p>ITB's march &quot;Mars ITB&quot; and hymn &quot;Hymne ITB&quot; were arranged by a former professor, Prof. Dr. Sudjoko Danoesoebrata.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), was founded on March 2, 1959.
The present ITB main campus is the site of earlier engineering schools in Indonesia.
Although these institutions of higher learning had their own individual characteristics and missions, they left influence on developments leading to the establishment of ITB.</p>
<p>In 1920, Technische Hogeschool (TH) was established in Bandung, which for a short time, in the middle forties, became Kogyo Daigaku.
Not long after the birth of the Republic of Indonesia in 1945, the campus housed the Technical Faculty (including a Fine Arts Department) of Universitas Indonesia, with the head office in Jakarta.
In the early fifties, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, also part of Universitas Indonesia, was established on the campus.</p>
<p>In 1959, the present lnstitut Teknologi Bandung was founded by the Indonesian government as an institution of higher learning of science, technology, and fine arts, with a mission of education, research, and service to the community.</p>
<p>Government Decree No. 155/2000 pertaining to The Decision on ITB as Legal Enterprise (Badan Hukum) has opened a new path for ITB to become autonomous.
The status of autonomy implies a freedom for the institution to manage its own business in an effective and efficient way, and to be fully responsible for the planning and implementation of all program and activity, and the quality control for the attainment of its institutional objective.
The institution has also freedom in deciding their measures and taking calculated risks in facing tight competition and intense pressures.</p>
<p>Bandung, with a population of approximately one and a half million, lies in the mountainous area of West Java, at an altitude of 770 meters.
The ITB main campus, to the north of the town centre, and its other campuses, cover a total area of 770,000 square meters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Technische Hoogeschool</h3>
<p>ITB traces its origin to <em>de Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (THB)</em> established by the Dutch colonial administration to meet the needs of technical resources at its colony in the region now known as Indonesia.
When the school opened its door for the first time on July 3, 1920, it had one department namely 'de Faculteit van Technische Wetenschap' with only one academic major of 'de afdeeling der Weg en Waterbouw'.
Later ITB became part of the Faculty Engineering of the <a>University of Indonesia</a> (UI) in <a>Jakarta</a> after <a>Indonesian independence</a> in 1945.
On March 2, 1959 ITB was officially chartered as a separate academic entity by the government of Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Towards Autonomy</h3>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The ITB main campus, to the north of the downtown Bandung, and its other campuses, cover a total area of 770,000 square meters.</p>
<p>Students and faculty housing, and administrative headquarters are not on the main campus but are within easy reach.
Facilities on the campus include book shops, a post office, student cafeteria, and medical clinic.
The architecture of ITB is a fine mixture of the traditional and the modern, and the beauty of the buildings is enhanced by the surrounding lawns and gardens.</p>
<p>In addition to lecture rooms, laboratories, workshops and studios, ITB has an art gallery, sports facilities and a student activities' center.
Also near the campus is the Salman Mosque for worship and religious activities of the ITB Muslim community.
For implementation of academic and research activities there are seven academic support facilities, namely, the Central Library (with approximately 150,000 books and 1000 journal titles) on campus, Sports Center, Language Center, and the <a>Bosscha Observatory</a> (a facility of the Department of Astronomy) in Lembang, 11 kilometers to the north of Bandung.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Organization</h3>

<h3>Admission and Selectivity</h3>
<p>Admission to ITB is conducted exclusively through (nationwide) entrance examination.
Historically ITB has been the most selective University in the nation.
In 2000, the last Asiaweek survey available, ITB ranked first in Asia in student selectivity.
In the 2007 and 2008 national entrance examination, ITB has the highest average score as well as the highest passing grade in the nation.
The aggregate admission rate in 2008 was around 4%.
According to THE-QS, an England-based University surveyor, ITB was ranked 80th in the field of Engineering and IT in the world, the only university in Indonesia within the top 100.
The first rank was occupied by MIT.
While according to the level of student selectivity, ITB got the highest difficulty level in the field of science through the SNMPTN (national selection to enter public university in Indonesia) in 2009 from 422,159 examinees.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The typical student life in the ITB can be categorized into 4 general phases</p>
<p>At the first phase of the study, which occurred in the first year, the students will not yet pursue courses related to their specific majors.
This so called &quot;Tahap Persiapan Bersama&quot; (TPB) phase, includes general science and education courses such as calculus, physics, chemistry, languages, politics, moral studies, and other few courses that serve as an introduction to the students specific majors.
To advance to the second phase, the student will need to obtain a CGPA&gt;2, with all courses' grades of C or better.</p>
<p>In the second and third year, so called the &quot;Sarjana Muda&quot; phase, students pursue courses related to their specific major.
Here, a few courses might be offered from other departments due to the needs in providing necessary foundations.
For example, in the Chemical Engineering (Teknik Kimia) track, the students will be required to take the Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry classes from the Chemistry Department.</p>
<p>The final phase (fourth year), so called the &quot;sarjana&quot; phase, is the final phase of which the students pursue a more advanced courses in their related fields, and also a few classes related to introductory management and economical sciences.</p>
<p>The typical daily life of an ITB student, other than taking classes, includes the choice of meals on several university cafeterias.
On their free time, some students choose to study in the library, while some others chooses to meet friends whom are associated with similar interests, i.e. student organizations, etc.</p>
