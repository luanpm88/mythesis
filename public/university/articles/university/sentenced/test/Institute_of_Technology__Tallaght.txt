<p><strong>Institute of Technology, Tallaght</strong> (<strong>ITT</strong>) formerly <strong>Regional Technical College, Tallaght</strong>, located in <a>Tallaght</a>, <a>South Dublin</a> in <a>Ireland</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institute was established in 1992, at that time the final new <a>Regional Technical College</a> opened in Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2005 the institute adopted the abbreviated title of <strong>ITT Dublin</strong>, to differentiate it from IT Tralee; this does not change the legal name which continues to be &quot;Institute of Technology, Tallaght&quot; as confirmed in the Institutes of Technology Act, 2006.</p>
<h2>Faculties and Courses</h2>
<p>The institute offers a variety of courses including: <a>Higher Certificate</a>s and <a>Bachelors Degree</a>s as well as <a>Postgraduate courses</a> in the schools of <a>accountancy</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>computing</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>humanities</a> and <a>science</a></p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The college has many societies such as drama society.
It has many successful sports teams.
ITT is in the process of redeveloping land donated by Saint Mary's Priory for use as sports pitches.</p>
<p>The Club's and Societies in IT Tallaght are some of the best in Ireland.
For the size of the college the sports clubs box way above their weight and the societies that are involved in national events often bring home awards.
Financial support from the college is given but the real centre of help comes from Tim O'Connor.
Tim has been the Sports and Recreational Officer for many years and has seen students go right to the top of national events.
His attitude towards college focuses on a healthy social/academic balance and has always noted that some of the best sports men and women from the college have also been the top performers in the classroom.
He motived students to take part in whichever sport or society they like and makes sure that everyone involved receives the best available resources.
It is unequivocally Tim who keeps the blood of IT Tallaght's sports and societies flowing strongly.</p>
