<p>   <strong>Beihang University</strong>, previously known as <strong>Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</strong> (, abbreviated as <em>BUAA</em> or <em>Beihang</em>) is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Beijing</a>, <a>China</a>.</p>
<p>BUAA was founded on October 25, 1952 with an area of over 100 hectares, BUAA is one of China's leading universities on research and education.
It is regarded as one of the best engineering universities in China and has a great influence on China's <a>aeronautical</a> and <a>astronautical</a> industry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Initial years</h3>
<p>BUAA was formed in 1952 from a merger of the aeronautical departments of <a>Tsinghua University</a>, <a>Peiyang University</a>, <a>Xiamen University</a>, <a>Sichuan University</a>, <a>Yunnan University</a>, <a>Northwestern Engineering College</a>, <a>North China University</a>, and <a>Southwest Aeronautical Institute</a>.

<p>The meeting announcing the founding of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics (BIA) was held in the auditorium of Beijing Institute of Technology on October 25, 1952.
In the early days of the university, most of the faculty and students lived on campuses of <a>Tsinghua University</a> and <a>Beijing Institute of Technology</a> before they moved on to their own new campus, which was chosen in May, 1953 and located at the BaiYanZhuang Village, <a>Haidian District</a>, in the western suburb of Beijing.
Construction of campus buildings started on June 1, 1953.
More than 60,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of buildings were completed within 6 months.
By October, 1953, all students and some of the faculty moved to the new campus and started their daily work and study.
Initially, there were two departments with 4 majors: Aeroplane Design and Aeroplane Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engineering, and Engine Design, Engine Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engine Engineering.
</p>
<p>BUAA was among China's first 16 key universities back in the 1950s, and among the top 15 for priority development during China's <a>7th Five-Year Plan</a> period (1986&#x2013;1990).
During the <a>8th Five-Year plan</a> it was listed among the top 14 for priority development, and at the start of the <a>9th Five-Year Plan</a> BUAA was among the first batch of 15 universities in &#x201c;<a>project 211 for Higher Education</a>.&#x201d;</p>

<h3>Feng Ru Cup</h3>
<p><em>Feng Ru Cup</em>, named after China's first aircraft designer and aviator Feng Ru , is an annual competition of student scientific innovation works in BUAA.
It is like <a>Senior Project</a> in the <a>United States</a>.
This competition attracts thousands of students each year.
All first prize winners can continue their graduate studies exempt from <a>entrance examination</a> in BUAA.</p>
<h3>Student societies</h3>
<p>There are various of student societies and activities to join, from sport clubs to scientific interest groups.
Student scientific and engineering innovation groups can have fund from different entities, e.g.
departments, schools and companies.
All students activities are organized by <a>Communist Youth League of China</a>, BUAA branch.</p>
<h3>Gender balance</h3>
<p>However, the common concern of engineering universities is also shared in BUAA&#x2014;the gender balance.
In some serious engineering departments like the School of Jet Propulsion, School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Astronautics, female students are so rare that the ratio of male to female students in an undergraduate class can be as low as 7:1.</p>
