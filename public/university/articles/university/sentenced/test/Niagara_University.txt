<p><strong>Niagara University</strong> is a <a>Catholic university</a> in the <a>Vincentian</a> tradition, located in the Town of <a>Lewiston</a> in <a>Niagara County, New York</a>.
Originally founded by the <a>Congregation of the Mission</a> in <a>1856</a> as Our Lady of Angels Seminary, it became Niagara University in <a>1883</a>.
The University is still run by the Vincentian Fathers.
All of Niagara's 25 presidents, including its current president, Father Joseph L. Levesque, C.M., have been Vincentian priests.</p>
<p>Niagara has 3,300 undergraduate students in 50 academic programs.
Approximately half of the students are residents, while the other half commutes from the surrounding area.
The college is known as a liberal arts school, but offers programs in technical and pre-professional disciplines as well.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>College of Arts and Sciences</h3>
<p>The <a>College of Arts and Sciences</a> forms the foundation of the Niagara University's curriculum and serves as the basis for its designation as a liberal arts college.
All Niagara students complete a portion of their coursework in the College of Arts and Sciences, as numerous general education courses are housed within this unit.</p>
<p>A majority of Niagara's <a>academic departments</a> and <a>faculty</a> are housed within Arts and Sciences, including: Biochemistry/Chemistry, Biology/Life Sciences, Communications, Computer Science, Criminal Justice, English, History, International Studies, Liberal Arts, Mathematics, Modern Languages, Nursing, Political Science, Philosophy, Psychology, Religious Studies, Sociology, Social Sciences, Social Work, and Theater Studies.
</p>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences also offers Master's degrees in both <a>Criminal Justice Administration</a> and <a>Interdisciplinary Studies</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008, Niagara University announced that a $10 million gift, the largest gift in the university's history, had been made to the College of Arts and Sciences by <a>B.
Thomas Golisano</a>, the CEO of <a>Paychex</a> and the owner of the <a>Buffalo Sabres</a>.
The gift will fund a new science building, to be known as the B. Thomas Golisano Center for Science.
The groundbreaking for the project is scheduled for May 2011.</p>
<h3>College of Business</h3>
<p>With programs in Accounting, Business Administration, and Commerce, the College of Business continues to enhance its academic standing at the local, regional, and national levels.
Each year, students in the College of Business conduct tax return processing as a community service for area residents.</p>
<p>On January 23, 2006, the University announced a gift of $5 million from College of Business alumnus Gerald Bisgrove, Class of 1968.
At the time, it was the largest single gift in Niagara's 150-year history.
$4.5 million of this gift has been appropriated to expand the College of Business facilities.
Groundbreaking occurred on this project in May 2006, and Bisgrove Hall was opened to the public in August 2007.
The remainder of Mr. Bisgrove's gift will be allocated to academic scholarships in the College of Business.</p>
<h3>College of Education</h3>
<p>Niagara has a long-standing commitment to training teachers for K-12 schools.
Education students major in the College of Education and choose a concentration in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Student teaching takes place in area schools, many of which are located in rural or low-income urban districts.</p>
<h3>College of Hospitality and Tourism Management</h3>
<p>The College of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Niagara's newest, is an offshoot of earlier tourism programs at the university.

<p>The College of Nursing, long a Niagara institution, graduated its last class in 2003.

</p>
<p>In response to the chronic shortage of nurses, Niagara University created the Department of Nursing in the College of Arts and Sciences to offer an <a>RN to BS in Nursing Completion Program</a>.
