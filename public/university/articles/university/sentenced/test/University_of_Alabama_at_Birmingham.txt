<h2>Institution History</h2>
<p>UAB is the newest and largest in terms of faculty, staff, and budget of Alabama's major universities.
UAB began in 1936 as the Birmingham Extension Center of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
Because of the rapid growth of the Birmingham area, it was decided that a program for students in the Birmingham area was needed.
In 1945, the <a>University of Alabama School of Medicine</a> moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham, and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman Hospitals in Birmingham.
In 1966, the Extension Center and the School of Medicine were merged into the University of Alabama in Birmingham.
In 1969, UAB became one of three autonomous institutions of the <a>University of Alabama System</a>, which includes the <a>University of Alabama</a> (UA) in <a>Tuscaloosa</a> and the <a>University of Alabama in Huntsville</a> (UAHuntsville).
The university's name was changed to the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1984.
and construction projects are common across campus.
Current projects that are in planning, recently completed, or under construction include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shelby Biomedical Research Building</li>
  <li>Southern Bio-Safety Lab Alabama Birmingham</li>
  <li>Alumni Affairs House</li>
  <li>UAB Softball Complex</li>
  <li>Campus Green Project</li>
  <li>Women's and Infants Center </li>

<h3>Campus Green</h3>
<p>In 2007, UAB constructed a new park called the Campus Green.
Planning for the Campus Green began in late 2000.
The park is divided into the North and South Greens.
The North Green is 340' long and 240' wide.
The South Green is  square of green space and major sidewalks with pedestrian lighting, decorative architectural landscape elements, and multiple trees.
There is also a formal garden and a corner plaza.
The Green is bordered by Blazer Hall, the Commons on the Green (the campus dining faculty), the Campus Recreation Center, and the new  Heritage Hall academic building.
Blazer Hall opened in Fall 2006 and is a new 753-bed freshman Residence Hall located adjacent to the Commons on the Green.
Other aspects of the Campus Green that would make it distinctly representative of UAB are being discussed such as a bell tower and fountains area.</p>

<h2>Honors Programs</h2>
<h3>University Honors Program</h3>
<p>The University Honors Program (UHP) is UAB&#x2019;s core liberal arts honors program.
This program provides students with a variety of interdisciplinary courses that are designed to be more challenging, innovative, and personal than normal courses.
The program only accepts a maximum of 50 students per year that represent a diverse range of majors and disciplines in order to create a unique and cultivating learning environment.</p>
<p>This program does not have any minimum requirements for admission.
Applicants are considered if they demonstrate particular academic or creative talent and after having a personal interview.</p>
<p>The University Honors Program represents a unique program.
The interdisciplinary fall course consists of a 9 hour block (equivalent to three classes) taken the fall of freshman and sophomore years.
These classes have an overarching theme such as &quot;Bottom Up, Top Down,&quot; &quot;The Anatomy of Desire,&quot; and &quot;Paradigm Shifts&quot; and are team taught by at least five faculty members from varying disciplines.
These courses have in the past featured faculty from psychology, literature, visual arts, physics, egyptology, and applied neuroscience just to name a few.
This class combines freshman and sophomores together in a small learning environment allowing them to explore curiosities and form friendships across age groups.
The remaining portion of the honors curriculum is made of 5 seminars.
These are also very diverse in subject and are taught in small class sizes of approximately 15.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|UAB Spencer Honors House</a></p>
<h3>Science and Technology Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Science and Technology Honors Program, otherwise known as Sci-Tech Honors or S&amp;T Honors, is UAB&#x2019;s research based honors program.
This program prepares students for research careers and graduate school by connecting them with labs and mentors in their undergraduate years.
The first two years of the program focus primarily on teaching the methodologies and techniques used in scientific research, while the last two years are spent on developing the student&#x2019;s Honors Thesis, consisting of an individual research project and report that will be submitted for publication.</p>
<p>The program also encourages collaboration amongst students and boasts its tight-knit learning community, which is facilitated by numerous program meetings, activities, and summer retreats.
In order to promote these ideas, the program only accepts a maximum of 50 students each year.
The minimum requirements for application are a 3.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and an ACT or SAT score at or above the 90th percentile in math and science.
However, all applications are individually reviewed and there is no definite cut-off based on ACT or SAT scores.</p>
<h3>Experimental Learner's Scholars Program (ELSP)</h3>
<p>ELSP is a new program on the UAB campus, started in the fall of 2009.

This program provides specialized curriculum and incorporates Study Away/Study Abroad programs into its required courses.</p>
<h3>The Early Medical School Acceptance Program</h3>
<p>The Early Medical School Acceptance Program (EMSAP) is the most competitive honors program available at UAB. EMSAP serves as a magnet for academically superior high-school seniors, attracting them to UAB&#x2019;s undergraduate programs by offering guaranteed acceptance into the School of Medicine, Dentistry, or Optometry, after completion of their undergraduate degree at UAB.</p>
<p>EMSAP is a combination of three separate programs: the Early Medical School Acceptance Program (EMSAP), the Early Dental School Acceptance Program (EDSAP), and the Early Optometry School Acceptance Program (EOSAP).
Currently, EMSAP accepts only 10 students per year into its program while EDSAP and EOSAP, both of which are new programs starting Fall 2008, are anticipated to accept only 1&#x2013;2 students each per year.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements for application are a 3.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and at least a 30 ACT or 1320 SAT (out of 1600).
However, the average ACT score of those accepted ranges from 32 to 36.
The minimum academic requirements for remaining in good standing are a 3.5 GPA in natural science and math courses and a 3.6 GPA overall.
Should a student&#x2019;s GPA drop below these minimums, the student is placed on probation and has one year to bring their GPA back up to the minimum, or be expelled from the program.
In addition, EMSAP students must achieve a minimum score of 28 on the  MCAT examination before their matriculation into the School of Medicine, while EDSAP and EOSAP students must make at least average scores on the DAT and OAT.</p>
