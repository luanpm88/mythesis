<p>The <strong>College of New Rochelle</strong> (<strong>CNR</strong>) is a private <a>Catholic</a> college with its main campus located in <a>New Rochelle, New York</a>.
The College of St. Angela was founded by the Order of the <a>Ursulines</a> as the first Catholic <a>women's college</a> in New York state in 1904, a time when women were generally excluded from higher education.
The name was changed to the College of New Rochelle in 1910.
Building on its original commitment to women, the college reaches out to those who have not previously had access to higher education.
It places particular emphasis on the concept of life long learning.
Three of the four schools are now co-ed.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><a>left|300px</a> Following the university model, the College of New Rochelle is composed of four separate schools: </p>

  <li>Graduate School</li>
  <li>School of Nursing</li>
  <li>School of New Resources (for adult learners)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Its oldest school, the School of Arts &amp; Sciences was established in 1904 as a <a>women's college</a> and still enrolls only women students.
It offers courses in the <a>liberal arts</a>, pre-medicine, pre-law, communication arts and business.
Both men and women may enroll in the School of Nursing, the School of New Resources (for adult learners) and the Graduate School.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>right|300px</a></p>
<p>The main campus is located in <a>New Rochelle</a>, a suburban <a>Westchester</a> city about  north of <a>Manhattan</a>.
In 1896, the college's founder, Mother Irene Gill, traveled to New Rochelle to explore the possibility of establishing a seminary there for young women.
It was during this trip that she came across <a>Leland Castle</a>, an 1850s <a>gothic revival</a> structure and former vacation home of wealthy New York hotelier Simeon Leland.
The castle was purchased in 1897 and became the first structure of the College.
It has since been designated a National Historic Site.
The castle is part of the campus quadrangle and currently houses the &quot;Castle Gallery&quot;.
</p>
<p>The campus consists of 20 main buildings including a $28MM athletic, recreational and educational complex called The Wellness Center (completed in 2008), including an <a>NCAA</a> competition-sized swimming pool, basketball court, fitness center, indoor running track, <a>yoga</a> studio, roof garden and meditation garden, and volleyball court; The Mooney Center with computer and photography labs, TV production studio and the Debra and Russel Taylor Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies; the 200,000-volume Gill Library; the Student Campus Center; the Rogick Life Sciences Building with many laboratories; four <a>residence hall</a>s; and the Learning Center for Nursing.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The College of New Rochelle Blue Angels, who make their home in the College's new Wellness Center, are an NCAA Division III athletic program and a member of the Association of Division III Independents (D3 Independents) and locally the Hudson Valley Women&#x2019;s Athletic Conference (HVWAC).
The Blue Angels have a rich athletic history, which includes numerous NCAA records and All American selections.</p>
<p>With competitions offered in Basketball, Volleyball, Softball, Tennis, Swimming, and Cross Country, the College offers a varied and competitive program.
Cheerleading is offered as a year-round program administered by the Athletic Department.
Club Soccer has been a recent addition to the athletic program.</p>
<h5>Mission</h5>
<p>The Mission of the Intercollegiate Athletics Department is to support and realize the Shared Vision of the College and in particular, the Student Services Philosophy and Statement of Mission and Goals by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing the qualities of mind and physical skills needed by a student-athlete to meet academic and athletic challenges;</li>
  <li>Developing a clear sense of abilities and promoting a sense of worth as individuals and as members of a team;</li>
  <li>Providing competitive opportunities appropriate to the skill levels of our student-athletes on a local, regional, and national basis; </li>
  <li>Developing the capacity for ethical decision making; </li>
  <li>Promulgating high academic standards as well as providing a broadly based academic experience; </li>
  <li>Sharing the vision with others that our fundamental philosophy of studying, working, and participating is composed of many elements and touches many people throughout the lives of the student-athletes; </li>
  <li>Encouraging the student-athletes to make commitments to serve as involved members of our concerned and active community; </li>
  <li>Fostering the ideal that student-athletes and the Athletic Department staff act with respect and brotherhood to all; and </li>
  <li>Carrying the name of the College to the general public and our positive image, winning attitudes, thus participating in advancing and enriching the community of the campus.
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As part of our NCAA Division III Philosophy we realize:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Intercollegiate Athletics is an integral part of the total educational experience; </li>
  <li>Student-athletes have the opportunity to develop skills, techniques, and lifelong friendships; </li>
  <li>As an integral component of the total learning experience it will lead to the student-athletes overall enrichment, growth, and development; and </li>
  <li>Intercollegiate competition promotes a positive atmosphere and contributes to the physical, social, mental, and emotional advancement of the student-athlete.</li>
</ul>
<h5>History</h5>
<p>The first mention of sports at CNR is in the St. Angela&#x2019;s Quarterly in 1905.
A coach was hired to organize a basketball team.
By 1908, annual inter-class athletic meets began between the &#x201c;odds&#x201d; and &#x201c;evens&#x201d; (year of graduation).
The meets became a focus of inter-class spirit and competition&#x2014;often reaching a fevered pitch.
Each class had its own colors, banners, and songs which were brought out for the meet.
Ingenious ways and places of getting the class banner to the highest point on campus put lives in peril as students scaled trees, sneaked up to the Castle towers, or climbed onto roofs to place the class banner.
Held in the fall and spring, the meets initially involved gymnastic drills as well as basketball.
Later, track and field competitions were held and awards were given.
The meets continued until the early 1940s.
Intramural sports were popular--basketball, volleyball, golf, hockey, tennis, and riding.
In 1916, CNR began playing basketball with other college teams.</p>
<p>In less than 30 years, the growing College needed a much larger and more modern gymnasium than the gym in Chidwick.
In 1932, at the height of the Depression, the ultra-modern Art Deco Sports Building was completed&#x2014;with a pool, gymnasium, social rooms, equipment, and exercise rooms.
The Athletic Association was open to anyone interested in sports, as a team member or supporter.
Dues paid for some new equipment, parties, prizes, and speakers.
In later years, a full CNR scholarship was offered every four years, fundraised by the Athletic Association through sponsored games and dances.</p>
<p>Sports lost some of their appeal during the politically-turbulent late 1960s-1970s, but the annual Swimphony/Landphony water and land ballet competition begun when the pool was opened continued to spark class spirit and inter-class competition into the 1990s.
Exercise equipment was added in the 1970s, and the pool was often opened in the summer to day camps and residents of Residence Park.</p>
<p>The College of New Rochelle joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association during the mid 1980s.
CNR&#x2019;s basketball team took the name &#x201c;Blue Angels&#x201d; and won a number of local championships, a state championship and a NCAA Tournament bid, losing in the Championship Game.</p>
<p>The College also elevated the sports of volleyball, swimming, tennis, and softball to NCAA status.
CNR athletic teams have produced many successful team and individual records during their NCAA tenure.</p>
<p>Today, the &#x201c;Blue Angels&#x201d; remain an NCAA Division III Member and compete locally in the Hudson Valley Women&#x2019;s Athletic Conference and the New York State Women&#x2019;s Collegiate Athletic Association.
They have continued to place in the top echelon of the HVWAC, with the Volleyball Team winning the Championship.</p>
<h5>Affiliation Conferences</h5>
<p><strong><a>National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)</a></strong>&lt;br /&gt; This association provides for post-season competition on a regional and national level.
We are obligated to comply with the regulations established by the NCAA.</p>
<pre>  </pre>
<p>The number of events, number of student-athletes, length of season and student-eligibility are some of the aspects that the Coaches are responsible for knowledge of these regulations.
</p>
<p><strong><a>Hudson Valley Women's Athletic Conference (HVWAC)</a></strong>&lt;br /&gt; This is the local conference consisting of colleges in the Greater New York area.
The conference offers season and post-season competition in Volleyball, Basketball, Softball and Tennis.
Two general meetings are held each academic year.
Two sports meetings are held each season.
The coaches are invited to attend the general meetings.
</p>
<p><strong><a>Association of Division III Independents (AD3I)</a></strong>&lt;br /&gt; The Association of Division III Independents has evolved from an association where the purpose was to provide a unified voice to issues of common concern for independent institutions, to operating more like a conference in terms of offering exempted postseason championship opportunities, and enhanced recognition and stats programs for outstanding independent student-athletes.
</p>
<p>The mission is to continue to create a sense of belonging for member institutions and participating student-athletes, and establish a more tangible presence for the association on member campuses.</p>
