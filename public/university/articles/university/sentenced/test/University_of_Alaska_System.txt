<p>The <strong>University of Alaska</strong> is a land-grant university founded in 1917 in <a>Fairbanks</a> in the <a>State of Alaska</a>.
However, its largest campus by number of students was established in the much-more populous <a>Anchorage</a> area  </p>
<p>The University of Alaska System consists of three main <a>universities</a>, each with several satellite campuses in smaller communities.
These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>, the first university</li>
  <li><a>University of Alaska Anchorage</a>, the largest university, and</li>
  <li><a>University of Alaska Southeast</a>, its third component, located in the <a>capital city</a> of <a>Juneau</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly 33,000 students attend classes at these three campuses and their branches.</p>
<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) is home to the noted <a>Geophysical Institute</a>, which operates the <a>Poker Flat Research Range</a> presently the only collegiate rocket test range in the U.S. (The California Institute of Technology and other colleges formerly had them.
See <a>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>-History.)   Also, there is the <a>Arctic Region Supercomputing Center</a>, the location of the only <a>Cray</a> supercomputer in the Arctic region, and the <a>School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences</a> which has facilities and research projects all over Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>Since the population of Alaska is small, the University of Alaska System is a relatively-small one.
However, it does have several notable academic departments.
At UAF, these are the <a>geology</a> department, the <a>atmospheric sciences</a> department, and the <a>wildlife</a> <a>biology</a> department.
Reflecting the state's small population, the amount of Federal land granted to the University of Alaska under <a>Morrill Act</a> was the second-smallest grant in the country .</pre>
