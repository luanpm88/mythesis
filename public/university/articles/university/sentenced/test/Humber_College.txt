In November, 1968, North Campus was officially opened by Mayor E.A Horton of Etobicoke and Mayor Jack Moulton of York. .
In the early seventies, student enrollment was rapidly increasing which led Humber to develop 10&#x2013;14 section of Business Administration programs.

A 3 year co-op programs were developed in the early seventies.
