<p> <strong>Ernest Fox Nichols</strong> (June 1, 1869 &ndash; April 29, 1924) was a <a>U.S.</a> educator and <a>physicist</a>.
He was born in <a>Leavenworth County</a>, <a>Kansas</a>, and received his undergraduate degree from <a>Kansas State University</a> in 1888.
After working for a year in the Chemistry Department at Kansas State, he matriculated to graduate school at <a>Cornell University</a>, where he received degrees in 1893 and 1897.
He also studied at the <a>University of Berlin</a> and <a>Cambridge University</a>.</p>
<p>Nichols served as a professor of physics at <a>Colgate University</a> from 1892-1898, at <a>Dartmouth College</a> from 1898-1903, and <a>Columbia University</a> from 1903-1909.
Thereafter, Nichols served as the 10th President of Dartmouth College between 1909 and 1916, and as the president of <a>MIT</a> from 1921 until 1923.</p>
<p>Nichols was awarded the <a>Rumford Prize</a> by the <a>American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1905 for his proof that <a>light exerts pressure</a>.
He was also elected Vice President of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<h2>Dartmouth Presidency</h2>
<p>The appointment of Ernest Fox Nichols as the 10th president in the Wheelock Succession could be seen as both a reflection of the times and a tribute to the quality of Dartmouth's faculty.
A member of the physics department and its chair at the time of his appointment, Nichols' pioneering work in the measurement of <a>radiation</a> expanded the frontiers of knowledge at the end of the 19th century.
He was the first Dartmouth president since <a>John Wheelock</a> who was not a member of the <a>clergy</a>, yet his deep appreciation of the importance of broad-based scholarship to the moral and spiritual growth of students was internationally recognized.
</p>
<p>Many of the College's most cherished institutions and traditions took shape during the Nichols administration, including the <a>Dartmouth Outing Club</a> and <a>Winter Carnival</a>.
In addition, to improve communications between Dartmouth and its growing body of graduates, President Nichols established the <a>Dartmouth Council of Alumni</a>.</p>
<p>Ernest Fox Nichols stepped down in 1916 to become a professor of physics at <a>Yale University</a> and subsequently became president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
