<p> <strong>Hobart and William Smith Colleges</strong>, located in <a>Geneva</a>, <a>New York</a>, are together a <a>liberal arts college</a> offering <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a>Bachelor of Science</a> and <a>Master of Arts in Teaching</a> degrees.
In <a>athletics</a>, however, the two schools compete with separate teams, known as the Hobart Statesmen and the William Smith Herons.
Legally, the combined corporation of the two colleges, Hobart College and William Smith College, is <strong>The Colleges of the Seneca</strong>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><strong>Hobart College</strong> traces its roots to Geneva Academy, founded in 1796 by the Rev. Henry Axtell.
Hobart College proper was founded in 1822 as <strong>Geneva College</strong> and renamed in honor of its founder, <a>Episcopal</a> bishop <a>John Henry Hobart</a>, in 1852.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|350px|right|The Colleges&#x2019; campus, looking toward Seneca Lake.</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>Geneva at the time was a bustling <a>Upstate New York</a> city on the main land and stage coach route to the West.
When John Henry Hobart, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, visited Geneva in 1818, Geneva Academy had temporarily closed its doors.
Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the Academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status.</p>
<h3>Geneva Academy</h3>
<p>Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a little frontier settlement.
It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva.
The area was considered &quot;the gateway to Genesee County&quot; and was in the early stages of development from the wilderness.</p>
<p>The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825 and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College.</p>
<p>The period of greatest prosperity for the school occurred between the years 1840 to 1850.
During that time, a total of 596 physicians graduated from the college.</p>

<p>Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the head of her class, the first woman doctor in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Blackwell went on to found the New York Infirmary for Women and Children and had a role in the creation of its medical college.</p>
<p><strong>Coxe Hall</strong>, serves as the main administrative hub of campus.
In addition, the building, built in 1901, and named after Bishop Arthur Clevland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, houses the president's office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing which was added in the 1920s.
Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school.
The building was designed by <a>Clinton and Russell</a> Architects.</p>
<p><strong>Scandling Campus Center</strong>, Named after <a>William F. Scandling</a>, alumni of Hobart College, Scandling Center is the central hub of student life.
Scandling, renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).</p>
<p><strong>Gulick Hall</strong>, built in 1951 as part of the post-war &quot;mini-boom&quot; that also included the construction of the Hobart &quot;mini-quad&quot; dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th Century Hobart College president), Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar.
Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 prior to its renovation in 1992.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left| Medbery Hall in 1955</a></p>
<p><strong>Stern Hall</strong>, 2004, houses the political science, anthropology/sociology, and economics departments.</p>
<p><strong>Smith Hall</strong>, built in 1907, Smith Hall originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments.
It is now home to the Dean's Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments.
Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Williams Hall</strong>, 1907, built to house the first campus gymnasium, it served several other lives as campus post office, and book store after the construction of Bristol gymnasium.
Now home of the Music Department and IT services.</p>
<p><strong>Demarest Hall</strong>, connected to St. John's Chapel by St. Mark's Tower.
Houses the departments of religious studies, philosophy, and English and comparative literature.
Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.
Demarest was designed by <a>Richard Upjohn's</a> son, Richard M. Upjohn.
(Upjohn's grandson, <a>Hobart Upjohn</a> would additionally design several of the College's buildings as well).
Demarest served, until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s, as the College's library.
In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the College's growing number of volumes.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left| Demarest Hall, 1919</a></p>
<p><strong>Trinity Hall</strong> Built in 1837, Trinity Hall, is the second building to be built by the college.
Trinity Hall was designed by college president Benamin Hale, who taught architecture.
Trinity served a bout as a Dormitory, a library, and classroom building, but was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century.
It presently is home to the Salisbury Center for Career Services.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right| Merrit Hall, Chemistry Dept.</a></p>
<p><strong>Merrit Hall</strong>, built in 1879, Merrit was built of the ruins of the old medical college.

Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building.
On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times.
Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith.
Today Merrit Hall houses a lecture hall, and faculty offices.
<strong>St.
John's Chapel</strong>, Designed by <a>Richard Upjohn</a> the architect of <a>Trinity Church</a> in New York City, St. John's served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original Campus chapel.
In the 1960s, St. John's was connected to Demarest Hall by St. Marks Tower.</p>
<p><strong>Houghton House</strong>, The mansion, known for its Victorian elements, is home to the art and architecture departments.
The country mansion was built in the 1880s by <a>William J. King</a> .
It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family's summer home.
Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion's interior to the present classical decor in 1913.
The family's &quot;town home&quot; is 624 S. Main Street is now Sigma Phi.
Helen Vail's heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a woman's dormitory.
After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center.
The building is now home to the Davis art gallery, the Architecture studios on the top floor, lecture rooms, and multiple faculty offices.</p>

<p>   </p>
<h2>Coordinate System</h2>
<p>When many single-sex institutions became co-ed in the 1960s and '70s, both Hobart and William Smith retained their separate identities while integrating many aspects of student life in an arrangement called the &#x201c;Coordinate System&#x201d;.
Emblematic of the nature of this system is the sculpture of a scissors embedded in the lawn south of the library: two separate entities, joined together in order to work as a whole.
<a>thumb|left|The colleges' campus borders Seneca Lake.</a>
The colleges share most administrative offices (there is only one president's office, for example) they maintain separate deans' offices, athletics programs, student governments and, until recently, admissions offices.
Even some regulations about student life vary.
Hobart College allows <a>fraternities</a> and Greek organizations while William Smith does not allow <a>sororities</a>.</p>
<p>A male graduate receives a degree from Hobart College and a female graduate from William Smith College.
Alums are always referred to in the single-sex sense of the word, as &#x201c;alumnae and alumni&#x201d; and any reference to the institution is always in the plural (&#x201c;colleges&#x201d;).</p>
<p>Each college celebrates its own traditions.
During the academic year, William Smith College celebrates annual events such as Founder's Day and Moving Up Day.
Hobart has Charter Day, which celebrates the 1822 founding and its own honor societies:  The Druid Society for seniors (founded 1903), Chimera Society (juniors, 1910) and Orange Key (sophomores, 1926).
The William Smith Senior Honor Society is Hai Timai (&quot;Honored Women&quot; in Greek).
Each society has specific roles and functions on campus.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Hobart and William Smith Colleges offer degrees in <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a>Bachelor of Science</a>, and <a>Master of Arts in Teaching</a>.
The colleges follow the semester calendar and have a student to faculty ratio of 11:1.</p>
<p>The colleges are known for the number of students that study abroad for a semester during the academic year; in recent years, between 40% and 60% of students have spent at least one semester studying off-campus.</p>
<p>The Colleges have long been recognized for the high quality of their education and in 1961 were National Champions on the GE College Bowl, one of only three institutions in the United States to achieve this distinction at the time.
In 2004, a William Smith student was selected as a Rhodes Scholar.</p>
<p>From 2001-2004, Hobart and William Smith Colleges saw the publication of a literary magazine, SCRY!: A Nexus of Politics and the Arts.
Under the editorship of Binh Nguyen (Hobart '04), the magazine saw some contributions from professionals and students, both.
The Canadian poet/classicist Anne Carson appeared twice; John O'Brien, the founder of The Center for Book Culture, was included; the award-winning on-campus writers as Jim Crenner, David Weiss, Deborah Tall and James McCorkle submitted original poems.

The morning after the game, the <em><a>New York Times</a></em> referred to the team as &quot;the statesmen from Geneva,&quot; and the name stuck.
The nickname for William Smith's athletic teams comes from a contest held in 1982.
Several names were submitted, but &quot;<a>Heron</a>s&quot; was selected because of the strong and graceful birds that lived near Odell's Pond.
These ominous birds frequently flew over the athletic fields as the teams were practicing.</p>
