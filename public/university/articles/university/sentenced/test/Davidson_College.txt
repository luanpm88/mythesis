<p> <strong>Davidson College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Davidson</a>, <a>North Carolina</a>.
The college has graduated 23 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> and is consistently ranked in the top ten liberal arts colleges in the country by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> magazine.</p>
<p>Both the town and college were named after Brigadier General <a>William Lee Davidson</a>, a Revolutionary War commander.
The land for the college came from General Davidson's estate, a large portion of which was donated by his son.
The college was established by <a>Presbyterians</a> in 1837 and maintains a loose affiliation with that denomination.
According to its Statement of Purpose, &quot;the ties that bind the college to its Presbyterian heritage . . .
have remained close and strong&quot; but the dedication of the college &quot;extends beyond the Christian community to the whole of humanity and necessarily includes openness to and respect for the world&#x2019;s various religious traditions.&quot;
Majors are offered in over twenty fields, as are several minors and self-designed interdisciplinary options.</p>
<h2>Institution</h2>
<p>According to <a>The Princeton Review</a>, Davidson is ranked among the top twenty colleges nationally for the following categories: &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience For Undergraduates,&quot; &quot;Professors Get High Marks (#1),&quot; &quot;Professors Make Themselves Accessible (#16),&quot; &quot;Students Study the Most(#10),&quot; &quot;School Runs Like Butter (#4),&quot; &quot;Town-Gown Relations are Great (#3),&quot; &quot;Easiest Campus to Get Around (#3),&quot; and &quot;Best Quality of Life (#16).&quot;
Davidson students once complained of a lack of name recognition among the American public, but recent national media coverage, including articles in the <em>New York Times</em> Education supplement and <em>Time</em> and <em>Newsweek</em> magazines, has heightened Davidson's national profile.
<em><a>Newsweek</a></em> named Davidson as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies.&quot;
In 2007, <em><a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a></em> ranked Davidson fourth in the list of liberal arts colleges.
On 19 March 2007, Davidson became the first liberal arts college in the country to eliminate the need for loans in financial aid packages.
All demonstrated need is met through grants and student employment.
In 2009, <a>Forbes</a> rated it 60th of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>The school became co-educational in 1973 and today maintains a 50/50 ratio of men to women.
A high percentage of Davidson graduates enter the legal profession, medicine, or government service.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Admissions profile</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Chambers Building on the Davidson College campus</a></p>
<p>Numerous magazines such as <a>Princeton Review</a> and <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> regard Davidson's admission process as &quot;most selective&quot;.
</p>
<p>The Davidson College Office of Admission &amp; Financial Aid presents the college as one &quot;dedicated to intellectual and cultural growth in the broadest sense.&quot;
Davidson prides itself on a student body chosen not only for their academic promise, but also for their character.</p>
<p>&quot;Faculty and admission personnel work together to select students for admission.
The selection process is composed of three major elements: 1) the evaluation of academic performance and potential; 2) the assessment of individual characteristics; and 3) the recognition of outstanding interests, achievements, and activities.
These three elements are used to gain an understanding of each student's academic and personal strengths and, thus, give an overall evaluation of the individual's eligibility for admission.&quot;</p>
<h3>Faculty</h3>
<p>Davidson has a student-faculty ratio of 10-1, 89% of its classes are under 30 students, and no classes have more than 50 students.</p>
<p>Davidson has 167 instructional faculty members, of whom 159 are full-time employees.
Almost all faculty members have terminal degrees in their field, with 163 of the 167 faculty members holding a PhD or their field's terminal degree.</p>
<h3>Majors and minors</h3>
<p>Davidson offers majors in 20 subject areas, which include Anthropology, Art, Biology, Chemistry, Classics, Economics, English, French, German, History, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Religion, Sociology, Spanish, and Theater.
Students can also design their own major through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies.
In addition to the one major required for graduation, students may pursue a second major, a minor, or a concentration.
Interdisciplinary concentrations are offered in Applied Mathematics, Asian Studies, Computer Science, Education, Ethnic Studies, Film and Media, Gender Studies, Genomics, International Studies, Medical Humanities, Neuroscience, and Southern Studies.</p>
<p>In February 2002, the Royal Shakespeare Company opened the Duke Family Performance Hall, one of the premier performance spaces in the Southeast.
In 2007 and 2008, the Cunningham Fine Arts building, home to several smaller performance spaces, faculty offices, classrooms and set construction facilities, will be completely renovated.</p>
<p>Davidson President Tom Ross has repeatedly credited Davidson's Classics Abroad program with redirecting his life.
Begun by Professor George Labban in the 1960s, the program has survived the retirement of Labban and his successor Dirk French.
Presently, it is the most popular of the college&#x2019;s study abroad programs, along with the Semester in India program.
Davidson students may also take advantage of the wealth of outside study abroad programs available, applying their Davidson financial aid package to their program of choice.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Davidson competes at the NCAA Division I level in 21 sports.
Of these sports, 11 are men's and 10 are women's.
Approximately 24% of the Davidson on-campus student body participates in varsity sports.
Davidson has the second smallest enrollment of any school in Division I football.</p>
<p>Davidson's sports teams are known as the Wildcats.
Their colors are red and black, although since 2008, many sports including football, men's basketball, and men's soccer have moved towards a brighter hue of red and white.
The Wildcats participate as a member of the <a>Southern Conference</a> in most sports.
Sports that compete in other conferences include <a>football</a> in Division I Football Championship Subdivision <a>Pioneer Football League</a>, men's and women's swimming and diving in the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a>, Field Hockey in the <a>Northern Pacific Field Hockey Conference</a>, and women's lacrosse in the <a>National Lacrosse Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The Wildcat men have competed in 10 NCAA tournaments (1966, 1968&ndash;70, 1986, 1998, 2002, 2006&ndash;08).
Their last tournament victory was in <a>2008</a> over <a>Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball</a> in the third round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament.
With that victory, the Wildcats advanced to the Elite Eight where they lost to the eventual champion <a>Kansas Jayhawks</a> 59&ndash;57, capping off an incredible run that saw the rise of <a>Stephen Curry</a> to national prominence.
The Wildcats' NCAA Tournament run came after finishing their regular season undefeated in conference play, at 20&ndash;0, and as the champions of the <a>Southern Conference Tournament</a>.
Curry led the nation in scoring in 2008-09, his last season at Davidson before declaring for the 2009 NBA Draft.
</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Coach <a>Bob McKillop</a>, the Wildcats have consistently posted winning seasons.
In <a>2006&ndash;07</a>, the team completed its regular-season conference schedule with only one loss and entered the <a>Southern Conference Tournament</a> as a No. 1 seed, where the team would win the Southern Conference Tournament for the second consecutive season.</p>
<p>In <a>2005-06</a>, the Wildcats went 20&ndash;10 and earned an automatic bid to the <a>NCAA tournament</a> after winning the Southern Conference Tournament.
In 2004&ndash;05, the Wildcats were undefeated in conference play at 16&ndash;0 and advanced to the third round of the <a>NIT</a>.
In 2001&ndash;02, the Wildcats won the Southern Conference Tournament and lost a close game to Ohio State in the first round of the <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Driesell and McKillop, a number of notable NCAA men's basketball head coaches have coached at Davidson.
<a>Matt Doherty</a>, current head coach at <a>SMU</a> and former head coach of <a>Notre Dame</a>, <a>North Carolina</a> and <a>Florida Atlantic</a>, experienced his first coaching job as an assistant under McKillop, who, not coincidentally, was Doherty's high school coach on Long Island.
Former <a>Virginia</a> head coach and current <a>East Carolina</a> <a>athletic director</a> <a>Terry Holland</a> is a Davidson graduate (Class of 1964) and was Driesell's first recruit at Davidson, before advancing to assistant coaching, head coaching and athletic director duties at Davidson.
<a>Larry Brown</a>, who would go on to win an NCAA championship with Kansas in 1988 and NBA championship with Detroit in 2004, began his nomadic head coaching career at Davidson, managing to depart before the start of his first season.
<a>Jim Larranaga</a>, who took <a>George Mason</a> to the <a>2006 Final Four</a>, is a former Davidson assistant coach.
<a>Rick Barnes</a> of <a>Texas</a> was also a Davidson assistant.</p>
<h4>Men's soccer</h4>
<p>The men's soccer team at Davidson was declared a varsity sport in 1956 and had their first All-American player, Claude Finney, just four years later in 1960.</p>
<p>The peak of the soccer program was in 1992 when the team made a run to the NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament Final Four.
Led by two-time All-American <a>Rob Ukrop</a>, Davidson finished the regular season 17&ndash;5&ndash;5, earning an at-large invitation to the NCAA Tournament.
Three electrifying wins &#x2014; two on penalty kicks and one in sudden death overtime &#x2014; propelled Davidson into the Final Four, which miraculously was being hosted by Davidson on the school's campus.
Davidson lost 3&ndash;2 in overtime against San Diego in the semifinal game, but the team received plenty of accolades.
Ukrop led the nation with 31 goals and 72 points and was awarded the Adi Dassler Award, given to the nation's best player.
Head coach <a>Charlie Slagle</a> was awarded NCAA Division I Coach of the Year for men's soccer.
Remarkably, all of this was accomplished without the use of a single athletic scholarship on the 1992 team, leading the <em><a>New York Times</a></em> to herald the team as &#x201c;22 educated feet.&#x201d;</p>
<h4>Croquet</h4>
<p>Davidson's two-man golf croquet team has won the National Collegiate Croquet Championship back-to-back in 2007 and 2008.
It also brought home the national trophy again in 2010.
</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>The main student newspaper on campus is the <em>Davidsonian</em>, which is published weekly.
The <em>Davidsonian</em> was founded in 1914 and has published a volume every year since then.
In 2007, Davidson's Library completed a project to digitally archive all past issues of the Davidsonian.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Alvarez College Union, Davidson College, NC</a></p>
<p>Davidson offers over 150 student organizations on campus, including arts &amp; culture organizations, performance groups, sports groups, political organizations, health &amp; sexuality groups, religious organizations, and social action groups.
The Student Activities Office encourages and is available for students wishing to develop an organization not yet established at Davidson.</p>
<p>Most student events are sponsored by the Union Board, the student organization in charge of the student union.
In addition to hosting concerts throughout the Fall and Spring semesters, the Union Board organizes events such as pancake breakfasts at midnight, movies, and Freshmen welcome events.</p>
<h4>Davidson College <em>a cappella</em></h4>
<p>Davidson is also known for its three <a>a cappella</a> groups: the Generals, the Delilahs, and Androgyny.
The groups are among the most popular musical groups on campus.</p>
<p><a>The Davidson Generals</a>, an all-male group, took first place in the &quot;Rockin' the Forest&quot; intercollegiate a cappella competition at <a>Wake Forest University</a> in 2005.
Following the release of their third CD, &quot;Alpha-Kappa-Pella&quot; in 2006 they were selected for the <a>Voices Only</a> 2006 <a>collegiate a cappella</a> compilation CD with their cover of <a>John Legend</a>'s &quot;Used 2 Love U.&quot;  They released their fourth album, titled &quot;General Consensus,&quot; in the Spring of 2008 and their fifth album, &quot;Decorated&quot; in Spring 2010.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|Sloan Music Center, Davidson College, NC</a></p>
<p><a>The Davidson Delilahs</a>, an all-female group, have produced four albums to date: &quot;Falling into Place&quot; (2001); &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (2004); &quot;Kickin' Off our Heels&quot; (2006); and a brand new self-titled album &quot;Davidson Delilahs&quot; (2008).
The Delilahs also frequently host other a cappella groups from across the country, including, most recently, the <a>Haverford S-Chords</a>.</p>
<p><a>Davidson Androgyny</a> was founded in 1998 as a response to the absence of a co-ed a cappella group on campus.
Androgyny has released two albums, &quot;Everything But The Piano&quot; (2001) and &quot;The A Capocalypse&quot; (2003), and released its most recent album, &quot;A Class Act,&quot; in Fall of 2008.
The group also sang &quot;I'm Yours&quot; with platinum recording artist <a>Jason Mraz</a> on his &quot;Music, Magic, and Make Peace Tour&quot; stop at Davidson College on April 19, 2008.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and eating houses</h3>
<p>The fraternity and eating house system at Davidson is known as Patterson Court and is governed by the Patterson Court Council.
<a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Order</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, Connor House, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, Warner Hall, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, Black Student Coalition, Rusk House, and Turner House all currently occupy houses on Patterson Court.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a>Kappa Alpha Psi</a>, <a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a>, and <a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> maintain a presence on campus.
The <a>NPHC</a> sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha is the newest member of Davidson College's social community, receiving its charter in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<p>In total, there are nine national fraternities, four local women's eating houses, and one sorority on campus.
Approximately 65% of the female students and 38% of male students belong to a fraternity or an eating house.</p>
<h2>Royal Shakespeare Company Residencies</h2>
<p>In 2002, the <a>Royal Shakespeare Company</a> performed <a>William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a>The Merchant of Venice</a></em> in residency at Davidson College, the RSC's second residency at a US college or university.
The performance inaugurated the Duke Family Performance Hall.
In March 2005, the RSC returned to Davidson and was in residency for most of the month, performing <em><a>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></em> and <em><a>Julius Caesar</a></em> by <a>William Shakespeare</a>, as well as numerous educational activities, many of which were open to the general public.
In February 2006, their artists directed scenes from Shakespeare's plays and other theatric materials inspired by Shakespeare, entitled <em>For Every Passion, Something</em>, with Davidson students as actors.
The productions <em>Infinite Variety</em> and <em>For Every Passion Something</em> were presented at the <a>Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a> in <a>Edinburgh</a>, <a>Scotland</a>.
In February 2007, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed Shakespeare's <em><a>Pericles</a></em> and <em><a>The Winter's Tale</a></em>, as well as <a>Roy Williams</a>'s <a>Days of Significance</a>, in the Duke Family Performance Hall.
In 2008, the RSC conducted educational programs, similar to those they presented in 2006.
In addition, during this residency, playwright Rona Munro developed a new play, Little Eagles.</p>
<h2>Financial aid</h2>
<p>On 19 March 2007, Davidson College announced that all students would have their demonstrated financial need met by grants and student employment; loans would no longer be a component of any Davidson financial aid package.
On 7 June 2007, the <a>Duke Endowment</a> pledged $15,000,000 to support the initiative.
Davidson states that they are committed to providing 100% of demonstrated need of all students, with 35% of students receiving need-based aid and over 50% receiving some form of financial aid.</li>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Davidson College was founded in 1837 by The Concord Presbytery after purchasing  of land from William Lee Davidson II.
The first students graduated from Davidson in 1840 and received diplomas with the newly created college seal designed by Peter Stuart Ney, who is believed by some to be Napoleon's <a>Marshal Ney</a>.
<a>thumb|Philanthropic Hall (1850), Davidson College, NC</a></p>
<p>In the 1850s, Davidson overcame financial difficulty by instituting &quot;The Scholarship Plan,&quot; a program that allowed Davidson hopefuls to purchase a scholarship for $100, which could be redeemed in exchange for full tuition to Davidson until the 1870s.
The college's financial situation improved dramatically in 1856 with a $250,000 donation by Maxwell Chambers, making Davidson the wealthiest college south of Princeton.
The Chambers Building was built to commemorate this gift.
On November 28, 1921, the Chambers Building was destroyed in a fire but was rebuilt 8 years later with funds provided by a generous gift from the Rockefeller family.
The Chambers Building continues to be the primary academic building on campus.</p>
<p>In 1923, the Gamma chapter in North Carolina of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Davidson.
Over 1500 men and 500 women have been initiated into Davidson's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>In 1924, James Duke formed the Duke Endowment, which has provided millions of dollars to the college, including a $15 million dollar pledge in 2007 to assist with the elimination of student loans.</p>
<p>On May 5, 1972 the trustees voted to allow women to enroll at Davidson as degree students for the first time.
(Women had attended classes as early as the 1860s but did not enjoy degree privileges.
The first women to attend classes at Davidson were then-President Kirkpatrick's five daughters, who attended classes to increase the size of the student body during the Civil War.)  Art major Marianna &quot;Missy&quot; Woodward &#x2018;73, the only woman in a class of 217, was the first woman to graduate from Davidson.</p>
<p>In early 2005, the College's Board of Trustees voted in a 31-5 decision to allow 20% of the board to be non-Christian.
<a>John Belk</a>, the former mayor of <a>Charlotte</a> and one of the heirs of <a>Belk Department Store</a>, was a casualty of this decision, resigning in protest after more than six decades of affiliation with the college.
Stephen Smith also resigned.
Belk, however, continued his strong relationship with his alma mater and was honored in March 2006 at the Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the Belk Scholarship.</p>
