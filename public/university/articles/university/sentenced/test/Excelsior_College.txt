In April 1998, the Board of Regents granted the College an absolute charter to operate as a private, nonprofit, independent institution.
On January 1, 2001, <strong>Regents College</strong> changed its name to <strong>Excelsior College</strong>.
(Excelsior is <a>Latin</a> for &quot;ever upward,&quot; and is the motto of New York State.)
