Penn State Law, one of the professional <a>graduate schools</a> of Penn State, operates as a unified two-location operation with facilities in both <a>University Park, Pennsylvania</a> and <a>Carlisle, Pennsylvania</a>.
The two campuses operate meaningfully as a single enterprise, with a single identity, single reputation and single stature.
The University Park Campus is Penn State's main campus, and it maintains over 40,000 <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> <a>students</a>.
Carlisle, approximately  southeast of University Park, is the original home of the law school.
</p>
<p>The law school was founded by John Reed in 1834, making it the fifth oldest <a>law school in the United States</a> and the oldest law school in <a>Pennsylvania</a>.
It is home to over 600 law students, most of whom are earning the degrees of <a>Juris Doctor</a> (J.D.) or <a>Master of Laws</a> (<a>LLM</a>).
Penn State Dickinson has a faculty and staff of over 100.</p>
<p><em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>, in its 2010 edition of America's Best Graduate Schools, ranked Penn State Dickinson 72nd among the nation's top 218 law schools.
</p>
<p>In June 2007 Penn State established the <a>School of International Affairs</a> that is intimately linked with the law school.
The School of International Affairs, which offers a professional master's degree in International Affairs with several specialty concentrations, is housed administratively within the law school.
The two schools share similar educational objectives and outstanding faculty including <a>Randall Robinson</a>.</p>
<h2>Dual-Campus System</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>left|thumb|The H. Laddie Montague, Jr. Law Library|</a> --&gt;In 2005 a dispute over whether to move the Dickinson School of Law to Penn State's University Park campus in <a>State College, Pennsylvania</a> led to a dual-campus proposal.
Under this proposal, Penn State plans to invest over $110 million in a law school that will operate out of both locations.
The proposal was approved by the law school's board of trustees before the 2005-2006 academic year.
</p>
<p>The law school has now fully merged with Penn State, and has been integrated into the University's system.
Starting in the fall of 2006, the law school began offering classes at its University Park location.
Ground was broken for the Lewis Katz Building on January 18, 2007.
The building opened for classes in January 2009.</p>
<p>In January 2010, students in the Carlisle location began attending classes in the new Lewis Katz Hall and the renovated Trickett Hall.
The new facilities are the designs of <a>Polshek Partnership Architects</a>.</p>
<h2>Lewis Katz Building</h2>

<p>The Lewis Katz Building in <a>University Park, Pennsylvania</a>, opened for classes on January 9, 2009.
The $60 million,  building is the first academic facility to be built on the west side of Park Avenue, opposite from Penn State's main campus.
It is adjacent to the Penn State Arboretum.
</p>
<p>The Lewis Katz Building is LEED certified and equipped with advanced high definition digital audiovisual telecommunications capacity that enables the real-time delivery of classes and programs between the law school's Carlisle and University Park campuses and other collaborative projects and programs with schools and institutions worldwide.
The second floor includes the glass-enclosed library, with a two-story information commons, four group study rooms and 11 offices among the features.
Library spaces comprise about 50 percent of the building.
</p>
<p>In 2009, Judge D. Brooks Smith used the Lewis Katz Building's courtroom to hear an oral argument to the <a>Third Circuit Court of Appeals</a>.
In addition to the courtroom, the Katz Building includes a 250-seat auditorium, four specially designed 75-person classrooms, several seminar rooms, and a highly advanced &quot;board room&quot; permitting electronic &quot;face-to-face&quot; contact with meeting participants worldwide.</p>
<h2>Lewis Katz Hall</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- <a>right|thumb|Lewis Katz Hall, photo courtesy of Jason Minick </a>--&gt;</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the Carlisle building project is the addition of a new, signature Lewis Katz Hall, named in honor of the principal donor to the project, philanthropist and businessman, Lewis Katz, for his $15 million gift to the Law School.
Completed in January 2010, the transition marks the end of a two-year, $50 million construction project which included the addition of the elegant, new Lewis Katz Hall which is completely interconnected with the University Park campus via the most advanced high-definition, digital audiovisual telecommunications system available.
</p>
<p>The project included an extensive renovation of historic Trickett Hall, the Law School's home since 1918, which houses the Law School's library, named in honor of H. Laddie Montague, Jr., a prominent Philadelphia lawyer and trial attorney who has committed $4 million to the school.
As a design companion to the Lewis Katz Building the Carlisle campus is renovated and rebuilt to comply with LEED standards, the facilities feature state-of-the-art classrooms, a new courtroom/auditorium, an exterior courtyard, and an environmentally friendly vegetated green roof.</p>
<h2>Curriculum</h2>
<p>Like many law schools, the first year program consists of required courses that include two semesters of research and writing.
During their first year, 1Ls must complete courses in <a>Civil Procedure</a>, <a>Constitutional Law</a>, <a>Contracts</a>, <a>Criminal Law</a>, <a>Property</a>,<a>Criminal Procedure</a> and <a>Torts</a>.
Only two courses are required after completion of the first year: Professional Responsibility and a Seminar.
Students' remaining credits are to be filled with electives.</p>
<p>The law school is nationally recognized for its <a>Alternative Dispute Resolution</a> (ADR) Program.</p>
