<p><strong>North China Electric Power University</strong> () is a university based in <a>Beijing</a>, <a>China</a> under the national Ministry of Education that specializes in <a>polytechnic</a> disciplines.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was established as the <strong>Beijing Institute of Electric Power</strong> in 1958.
It was later renamed the <strong>North China Institute of Electric Power</strong> when its location was moved to <a>Baoding</a>, <a>Hebei</a> province in 1970.
When the school merged with the <strong>Beijing Power Engineering and Electronics Institute</strong> in 1995, it was given its present name.
In 2006, the university relocated its main campus from <a>Baoding</a>, Hebei province back to Beijing.
It still has the major campus in <a>Baoding</a>.</p>
