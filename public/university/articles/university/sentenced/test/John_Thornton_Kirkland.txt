<p> <strong>John Thornton Kirkland</strong> (August 17, 1770 &#x2013; April 26, 1840) served as <a>President of Harvard University</a> from 1810 to 1828.
A <a>minister</a> like many of his predecessors, he is remembered chiefly for his lenient treatment of students.
<a>Kirkland House</a>, one of Harvard's undergraduate &quot;houses,&quot; or residence halls, was named in his honor and in recognition of his term at the school's helm.</p>
<p><a>Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> describes him thus, in his study of <a>Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>: &quot;His 'shining morning face' was round as a baby's, and talked as pleasantly as his voice did, with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation....
It was of him that the story was always told,--it may be as old as the invention of printing,--that he threw his sermons into a barrel, where they went to pieces and got mixed up, and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon, and patched the leaves together as he best might.&quot;</p>
<p>His contemporary <a>George Ticknor</a> described Kirkland's sermons as &quot;full of intellectual wealth and practical wisdom, with sometimes a quaintness that bordered on humor.&quot;</p>
<p>Kirkland served as pastor of the <a>New South Church</a> in Boston, 1794-1810.</p>
