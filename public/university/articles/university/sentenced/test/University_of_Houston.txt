<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>[[Image:University of Houston in 1934.jpg|thumb|The
University of Houston administrative offices at [[San Jacinto High School]] in 1934]]  The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC).
On March 7, 1927, trustees of the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> <a>Board of Education</a> unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college.
The junior college was operated and controlled by the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> (HISD).</p>
<p>Originally HJC was located in <a>San Jacinto High School</a> and offered only night courses.
Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty.
The first president of HJC was <a>Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer</a>, who was the dominant force in establishing the <a>junior college</a>.</p>
<h3>University beginnings</h3>
<p>The junior college became eligible to become a <a>four-year institution</a> in October 1933 when Governor <a>Miriam A. Ferguson</a> signed House Bill 194 into law.
On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College became the University of Houston.</p>

At this time, there was no road that led to the land tract, but in 1937, the city added Saint Bernard Street, which was later renamed to <a>Cullen Boulevard</a>.</p>
<h3>State university</h3>
<p>[[Image:UH Religion Center.jpg|thumb|left|The
[[A.D. Bruce]] Religion Center was named after the former President of UH]] In 1953, the university established <a>KUHT</a>, the first educational <a>television</a> station in the nation, after the four-year long <a>FCC</a> television licensing freeze ended.
and forces from <a>state universities</a> geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.
This name change was an effort by the UH&nbsp;System to give its flagship institution a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the University of  (UHD), which is a separate and distinct degree-granting institution that is not part of the University of Houston.</p>
<p>As of the merger in 1997, the University of Houston System administration is located in the <a>Ezekiel W. Cullen Building</a> on the University of Houston campus.
On June 1, 2007, former UH President and Chancellor Dr. <a>Jay Gogue</a> left UH and UH System to become President of <a>Auburn University</a>.
The University of Houston System Board of Regents appointed John M. Rudley, vice chancellor/vice president for administration and finance, to serve as Interim UH System Chancellor and Interim UH President.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2007, <a>Renu Khator</a>&mdash;who had served as provost and senior vice president of the <a>University of South Florida</a>&mdash;was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president.
On November 5, 2007, Khator was confirmed as the third person to hold the UH System chancellor and UH president position simultaneously, and took her position in January 2008.

<h3>Media and entertainment</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|LeRoy and Lucile Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting</a> The official student newspaper is <em><a>The Daily Cougar</a></em>, and has been published since 1927.
<a>Frontier Fiesta</a>, a re-creation of a 19th-century <a>Western</a> town, with music, food and historical exhibits, is a major event on campus each spring semester.
The student led festival is a part of a long-standing tradition at UH dating back to the 1940s.</p>
<p>The official colors of the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white.
These were the colors of <a>Sam Houston</a>'s ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal.
Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man.
The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General <a>Sam Houston</a>.
The first official version was placed on the floor of the <a>Roy Gustav Cullen Building</a>.</p>
<p>The school's official mascot is a <a>cougar</a>, which was adopted in 1947 and later named <a>Shasta</a>.
The university had a live cougar, but the tradition ended in 1989.</p>
<p>The <a>Frontiersmen</a> are a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit.
At football games, the Frontiersmen&#x2014;donning <a>cowboy hat</a>s, <a>Wrangler Jeans</a>, and <a>dusters</a> for attire&#x2014;run across the field with the university's flag and the <a>Flag of Texas</a> after each score.</p>
<h3>The Cougar Paw</h3>
<p><a>thumb|95px|Graphic representation of The Cougar Paw</a> The Cougar Paw is a popular <a>hand sign</a> used by University of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie and support.
The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics events between the University of Houston and <a>The University of Texas</a>.
The first time UH played UT in <a>football</a> was in 1953, and since this was their first meeting, members of <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, the service <a>fraternity</a> in charge of taking care of <a>Shasta I</a>, the university's <a>mascot</a>, brought her to the game.
During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off.
At the game, members of the opposing team discovered what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent.
UT went on to win this game 28&#x2013;7, and UH students began using the sign as notice that they would remember the taunts.
In 1968, at their second meeting, the Cougars, holding up the now-adopted symbol of UH pride, played UT to a 20&#x2013;20 tie.
UH did not play UT again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the <a>Southwest Conference</a>.
In front of a record crowd, UH defeated UT 30&#x2013;0.
This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.
The film featured several real-life UH alumni and former men's golf team members, including <a>Fred Couples</a>, <a>Steve Elkington</a>, and <a>Bruce Lietzke</a>.
The 1999 film <em><a>Arlington Road</a></em> was partially filmed on-campus.
<a>Jeff Bridges</a>' character and his girlfriend are seen walking between Melcher Hall and the University Center.
Other locations on campus are the inside of a classroom in Agnes Arnold Hall and a telephone booth in the <a>College of Technology</a> Annex.
Also filmed on campus was the 2003 movie <em><a>Dude, Where's the Party?</a></em>,
where <a>Kal Penn</a>'s character attends the university.</p>
<p>In the long-running television show <a><em>Reba</em></a>, <a>Steve Howey's</a> character, Van, receives a scholarship to play as a cornerback for the <a>Houston Cougars football</a> team in the episode &quot;Labor for Love.&quot;
In a later episode, &quot;Skating Away,&quot; Van, his wife, Cheyenne, and their new baby move into an on-campus apartment at the university while Van plays football.</p>
<p>In the 1999 movie <em><a>Any Given Sunday</a></em>, <a>Jamie Foxx</a>'s character was portrayed as a former football player of the University of Houston.</p>
