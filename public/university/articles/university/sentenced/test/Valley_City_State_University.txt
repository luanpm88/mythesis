<p>VCSU is technology advanced and each student at the university receives a personal laptop for as long as you are enrolled at least 12 credits.
All this technology came in very handy when the city of Valley City had the flood in the spring of 2009.
A lot of classes started getting cancelled for the day and the students were to report to sandbagging duty.
It was easy for the students to receive these messages via email without having to go to campus to find out class was cancelled.
In Fact, the last month of classes was done completely online and it was successful due to the fact of being advanced</p>
