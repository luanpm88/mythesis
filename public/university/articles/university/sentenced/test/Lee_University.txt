<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lee University</strong> is a private, coeducational <a>university</a> located in <a>Cleveland</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>.
It is affiliated with the <a>Church of God</a>, which has its headquarters in the same town.
Lee University is named for F.J. Lee, second president of the institution (1922&#x2013;23) and one of the most respected leaders in the early years of the Church of God. Lee University was known as Bible Training School from 1918 until 1947 when the name was changed to Lee College.
Lee became a university in 1997 and continues to maintain a strong <a>Christian</a> identity.</p>
<p>Lee University's enrollment has more than quadrupled from 960 (Fall 1986) to 4,377 (Fall 2010) marking the 25th straight year of increased enrollment under president Dr. <a>Paul Conn</a>.
Lee University is now the 5th largest undergraduate enrollment among the 103 Christian colleges who are member institutions of the <a>Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>
<p>Although Lee is notable for its religious education; pre-medicine, business, elementary education, and <a>music</a> are also considered among its strongest specialties, and it is consistently ranked by <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> among the top <a>Southern</a> <a>liberal arts</a> colleges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Lee University (previously named Church of God Bible Training School, and later Lee College) has seen its strongest growth since the 1980s, during which time enrollment has quadrupled and full university status attained.
Lee's student body consists of 4,377 (grown from 960 in 1986) students (as of Fall 2010).
This makes Lee the 5th largest undergraduate enrollment among the 103 Christian colleges who are member institutions of the <a>Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a>.
Students currently represent all 50 states and more than 49 countries.
On average, Lee also accepts more than 200 transfer students each fall.
Since 1986, Lee has also added twenty-two major buildings necessary to serve the students.</p>
<p>Up to the 1970s the university culture had suspicion on people who held Ph.D.s, and the university had an open enrollment policy that placed functionally illiterate students and academically ambitious students in the same classes.
Hanna Rosin, author of <em>God's Harvard</em>, described the university culture at the time as having &quot;some vestiges of the Pentecostal anti-intellectualism&quot;.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Academic program</h3>
<p>Lee University is well-known for its academic program and the extensiveness and diversity of its extracurricular activities.
Many activities such as <a>chapel</a> attendance (offered 4 times per week, students are required to attend 2 services), <a>service</a> requirements (10 hours per semester-80 total hours to graduate), and the <a>study abroad</a> program (Typically taken during a summer break), are required of all graduates before they can receive their respective degree.
Exceptions to these are made only under rare circumstances and only under the approval of an academic <a>dean</a> or the school president.
All non-local entering <a>freshmen</a> are also required to live <a>on-campus</a> with exceptions made to married/divorced/widowed students, students with children, students 21 years and older, part-time students, and students living locally with immediate relatives.</p>
<p>Entering freshmen of Lee University choose their courses of study, developed under the guidance of a faculty adviser.
New freshmen and transfer students with under 16 credit hours are required to take a Gateway-Seminar course (a one-semester special topics seminar that stresses methods of inquiry, critical analysis, writing skills) and helps to transition the student to college life.
The Gateway course is taught by a professor who is paired with an upper class student.
To graduate, all students are generally expected to complete at least 42 <a>credit hours</a> in a major field and a total of 130 credit hours of academic work.
Included in the total is a <a>minor</a> in <a>Theology</a> that consists of 18 credit hours and is required of all students, regardless of their program of study.</p>
<p>Lee has forty-nine different majors offered for study.
Although Lee is notable for its <a>religious education</a>; <a>pre-medicine</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>elementary education</a>, and <a>music</a> are also considered among its strongest specialties.
Lee's intensive teaching, active learning, residence in a community of cultural and global diversity, and the institution's commitment to <a>Christian philosophy</a> in both social and academic life come together to form a distinctive experience of liberal education.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The school's sports teams are named the <strong>Flames</strong>.
With membership in the <a>NAIA Division I-AA</a> (NAIA), the Flames offer thirteen team sports for their men and women student athletes.
The available men's sports are: <a>Baseball</a>, <a>Basketball</a>, <a>Cross Country</a>, <a>Golf</a>, <a>JV Basketball</a>, <a>Soccer</a>, and <a>Tennis</a>.
Athletic programs offered for women are: Basketball, <a>Cheerleading</a>, Cross Country, <a>Fastpitch softball</a>, Golf, Soccer, Tennis, and <a>Volleyball</a>.

<h2>About the campus</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|300px|right|Aerial view of Lee University's campus</a> --&gt; Lee University is located in the town of <a>Cleveland, Tennessee</a>, which lies between <a>Chattanooga, Tennessee</a> and <a>Knoxville, Tennessee</a>.
Cleveland is located near the <a>Ocoee River</a>, the site of the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a> whitewater events, the <a>Smoky Mountains</a>, and the popular <a>Gatlinburg</a> area.</p>
<p>The  campus consists of various old and newly constructed academic buildings.
The residential part is also spread throughout the campus with multiple dormitories and housing.
Many building projects have been undertaken in recent years on the campus including; a new <a>Humanities</a> center, a new <a>Religion</a> building (2008), and a new state of the art <a>Science</a> building (2009).
The campus also features several small park areas and articulate landscaping.
The <a>sidewalks</a> went through a minor renovation several years ago to make them more <a>handicap</a> accessible as well.</p>

<h2>Social activities</h2>
<h3>Community covenant</h3>
<p>Lee University, like many faith-based colleges and universities, encourages a Christian philosophy of student behavior based on Biblical teachings.
All students are asked to sign a &quot;Community Covenant&quot; which lists several restrictions on behaviors and social interaction according to the school's institutional and religious policy.
Most notable are a substance policy barring alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.
Men and Women's dormitories are kept separate and premarital sexual intercourse is prohibited regardless of sexual preference, as is homosexual behavior in general.
Immodesty and &quot;occult practices&quot; are also forbidden.
[<a>http://www.leeuniversity.edu/pdf/newstudents/gateway-portfolio/014-community-covenant.pdf</a>]</p>
<h3>Greek organizations</h3>
<p>Like many colleges and universities in the United States, Lee University students have the opportunity to participate in Greek organizations for the purpose of building social and professional relationships.
Unlike chapters of most &quot;Greek&quot; <a>fraternities and sororities</a>, the primary Greek organizations on Lee University's campus are neither national nor recognized as fraternities or sororities and are instead colloquially referred to as &quot;Greek clubs.&quot;
[<a>http://students.leeuniversity.edu/info/student-life/clubs/greek.asp</a>]
The only national Greek fraternities at Lee University are <a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> and <a>Sigma Alpha Iota</a>, but they are officially regarded as academic organizations because of the administration's current policy against admitting national Greek fraternities and sororities onto its campus.</p>
