<h2>History</h2>
<p>Created in 1968, <a>UFSCar</a> was the first and until now, the unique Federal University in interior of S&#x00e3;o Paulo's state.
March 1970, it receive the first 96 students for the course of Science, today extinct, and <a>Materials Engineering</a> pioneer in Latin America.</p>
<p>Between presidential decree's signature that created December 1, 1968, and beginning class, a commission formed in S&#x00e3;o Carlos' city hall co-ordinated the works of campus' implantation.</p>
<p>Evaluated the possibilities, Thancham's farm, localized in the border of Washington Lu&#x00ed;s highway, was pointed as adequate to receive UFSCar.
Then, instalations of the old farm were adapt to accept the administration, classrooms and laboratories.
The university started with a technological profile with a strong emphasis on natural sciences.
This profile started to be changed during the 1990s, when UFSCar created more courses, departments and graduate programs in the humanities.</p>
<p>In 2008, UFSCar adopted the Federal plan to re-estructure and expand the public universities.
Since then, it has increased the number of campi, courses, graduate courses, staff and, in 2012, the university will be the double of what it was in 2007, id est, it will reach around 17,000 students.</p>

</p>
<p>From 1972 it was consolidated the conditions for the creation of the Center for Life Sciences and Health (CCBS, in Portuguese).
The first course of Degree Sciences was abolished and created the Undergraduate <a>Biological Sciences</a>.
