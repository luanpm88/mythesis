<h2>American Studies Institute</h2>
<p>The Harding American Studies Institute is designed to supplement students' academic training and promote &quot;a complete understanding of the institutions, values, and ideas of liberty and democracy.&quot;[<a>http://www.harding.edu/asi/info.html</a>]
In doing so, the ASI exhibits a generally conservative political stance, focused on going &quot;back to the fundamental values that made this country great.&quot;
The formal roots of this program date back to 1953, when Harding formed the School of American Studies.
</p>
<p>Prior to the formal foundation of the ASI, Harding was also involved in the production of a series of animated cartoons extolling the virtues of free-market capitalism.
This, too, forms a precursor to the political conservatism that has characterized the ASI.
This series, including 1948's  &quot;Make Mine Freedom&quot; (which, ironically, portrays activities not permitted by Harding's code of conduct at the time) and &quot;Going Places&quot;, as well as 1951's  &quot;Meet King Joe&quot;, were all produced by John Southerland Productions as part of a concerted propaganda program to fight against the perceived threats of <a>communism</a> at the beginning of the <a>Cold War</a> using popular media.
The animations portray mainstream American values, some of which might now be considered politically &quot;liberal,&quot; yet at the time, they were meant to contrast with the values of Soviet and Maoist <a>socialism</a>.
The initiative represented a central concern of Harding president George S. Benson, who believed that fighting socialism was a moral imperative, causing him to abandon the pacifism and political disengagement championed by founding influences <a>James A. Harding</a> and <a>David Lipscomb</a>, reversing the university's course and setting it on its current conservative political trajectory.</p>
<p>Currently, the ASI sponsors a number of programs aimed at promoting these values.
These include entrepreneurial and leadership programs, a distinguished student honors program, the Belden Center for Private Enterprise Education, and participation in the Walton Scholars Program, which brings in qualified students from Hispanic countries to Arkansas colleges and universities.</p>
<h3>Lecture series</h3>
<p>One of the most visible aspects of the American Studies Institute is the distinguished lecturer program.
In keeping with Harding University's current conservative political and religious leanings, the American Studies Institute invites distinguished lecturers to speak on campus on a regular basis.
Typically, there are four lectures in an academic year.
Speakers in the Lecture Series have included the following:</p>

<h2>International programs</h2>
<p>Harding offers several study abroad opportunities.
International campuses are located in Italy, Greece, England, Australia, Chile, France/Switzerland and Zambia.
Almost 40% of students from graduating classes have participated in one of these programs.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus comprises 44 buildings located on  near the center of Searcy.</p>
<p>The heart of the campus includes the George S. Benson Auditorium, which hosts daily chapel and sits facing the McInteer Bible and World Missions Center.
Brackett Library, the American Studies Building (Education and English departments, the American Heritage Center (hotel and offices), and the Administration Building frame a grassy central commons area upon which can be found several paths, a fountain, and a bell tower made out of bricks from the institution that once stood there: Galloway Women's College.
Notable additions in recent years have included several dormitories.
Expansions of the cafeteria, student center, art department, American Heritage Center, along with the addition of the Bible Center, came with the closing of the road that once ran through that part of campus.
It is now a pedestrian mall.</p>
<p>After years of playing in the Ganus Athletic Center, Harding's basketball teams moved back to the Rhodes Memorial Field House, a round-topped airplane hangar from WWII.
The &quot;old gym&quot; as it was once called was retrofitted to accentuate the already deafening acoustics of the facility, which has worked to the advantage of the home team.
The campus also has extensive intramural sports facilities.</p>
<p>The campus lies roughly between Race Avenue and Beebe-Capps Expressway and includes several other minor thoroughfares, the campus of <a>Harding Academy</a>, Harding Place (a retirement home), and portions of surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>200px|right|thumb|The Original Harding College Arch</a></p>
<p>Most students participate in local churches, social clubs, spiritual devotionals, or intramural sports.
Each weekday morning students attend chapel, a 35-minute devotional session.
Chapel presentations are usually led by students or faculty, but special events and guest speakers take place on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Social clubs</h3>
<p>Harding forbids formation of local chapters of national social <a>fraternities and sororities</a>.
In lieu of the traditional Greek letter organizations, Harding sponsors student-led &quot;social clubs&quot; that serve a similar social networking function to the Greek system.
Most of these organizations have adopted Greek letter names that are similar to national fraternity and sorority names.
Currently there are 13 women's social clubs and 14 men's social clubs at Harding.
Social clubs are open to all academically eligible students and serve as some of the university's most visible student-led organizations.
The clubs are a prominent part of student life with slightly more than half of all undergraduate students participating as social club members.</p>
<p>The social club induction process begins when clubs host &quot;mixers&quot; in the fall to recruit new members.
Prospective members then complete a &quot;visitation,&quot; which requires that they meet and interview every current member of the club.
The membership process culminates in Club Week, when each prospective member bonds with the other members of the club through a series of scheduled activities throughout the week.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, potential members are scored, and if their efforts are sufficient, they are accepted into the club.
Once a student is accepted into the club, they attend biweekly meetings and can participate in club-sponsored sports, service projects, and Spring Sing.</p>
<h3>Spring Sing</h3>
<p>Spring Sing is an annual musical production held during Easter Weekend, featuring performances by the social clubs.
It is widely attended by current and prospective students, alumni, and Searcy residents.
Typically, over 10,000 people attend the show.
Each year, an overall theme is selected, and each club develops music and choreographed routines for the show.
Rehearsals begin as early as January.</p>
<p>Spring Sing also typically features two hosts, two hostesses, and a general song and choreograph ensemble, with these roles chosen by audition.
The ensemble performs to music played by the University Jazz Band.</p>
<p>Each club act is judged, and according to their performance, each club is awarded a certain amount of money.
The clubs then donate this money to charities of their choice.</p>
<h3>Honor societies</h3>
<p>Harding is a member of many collegiate honor societies and is the current headquarters of the <a>Alpha Chi</a> Honor Society.

<h2>Policies and code of conduct</h2>
<p>In keeping with an expectation of &quot;highest standards of morality, integrity, orderliness and personal honor,&quot; Harding has a number of rules that were designed to foster these standards on campus.</p>
<p>Chapel and Bible class attendance are mandatory for students who are taking at least 8 hours for credit in a given semester.
Additionally, students must complete at least 8 hours of Bible courses in order to complete the Liberal Arts curriculum.
&quot;First Time In College&quot; (FTIC) students must take a survey course in New Testament during the fall of their first year, followed by a survey of the Old Testament in the spring.</p>
<p>Students who live on campus (a majority of students) are required to be in their dorms by midnight during the week and 1 a.m. on weekends.
Except in certain circumstances, men and women are not allowed to visit one another's dorm rooms.</p>
<p>Harding has a no-smoking policy on campus.
Disciplinary action may be taken against students who smoke off campus, and illegal drugs are prohibited both on and off campus.
The consumption of alcohol is also prohibited for students and faculty both on and off campus.
A violation of this policy usually results in expulsion for one semester.
Exceptions to this rule have been made for missionaries participating in communion services in countries where &quot;<a>partaking of the cup</a>&quot; includes wine.
(<a>Searcy</a> is in <a>White County</a>, which is a <a>dry county</a>.)</p>
<p>Harding requires faculty to dress professionally when attending class, chapel, lyceum and American Studies programs.</p>
<p>Students and faculty may not participate in any sexual activity outside of what the school considers to be traditional marriage.
The use or display of pornography is prohibited.</p>
