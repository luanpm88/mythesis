<p> The <strong>State University of New York at Plattsburgh</strong> (also known as <strong>SUNY Plattsburgh</strong> or <strong>Plattsburgh State</strong>) is a four-year, public <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Plattsburgh</a>, <a>New York</a>.
The college was founded in 1889 and opened in 1890.
The college is currently part of the <a>State University of New York</a> system and is accredited by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
The school is also a member of the <a>American Association of State Colleges and Universities</a>.
SUNY Plattsburgh has 6,214 students, of whom 5,567 are undergraduates.&lt;!-- Fall 2006 --&gt;, Weed's final bill was formally proposed on January 12, 1888.
With the strong backing of Assemblyman General Stephen Moffitt, the Plattsburgh Normal and Training School bill was passed by both houses of the New York State Legislature and signed into law by Governor <a>David B. Hill</a> in June 1889.
The Board of Directors adopted official by-laws for Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School on September 2, 1889.</p>

Normal and Training School, early-[[1910s]]]]At a meeting held on June 28, 1889, it was decided that the location of the new normal school would be on land known as &quot;the former athletic grounds&quot;, bounded on the north by Court Street, on the east by Wells Street, on the south by Brinkerhoff Street, and on the west by Beekman Street.
However these original plans were dropped in favor of a larger plot created by combining land on each side of Court Street west of Beekman Street, so that &quot;Court Street, one of the finest residence streets in the village, leads directly to the main entrance&quot;.
This is the same location where Hawkins Hall now rests on the current campus of SUNY Plattsburgh.&lt;sup&gt;<a>modern
map</a>&lt;/sup&gt;</p>
<p>The impressive structure, known as &quot;Normal Hall&quot;, was constructed by Brown Brothers of <a>Mohawk, New York</a>, who also built the Court House in downtown Plattsburgh.</p>
<p>Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School officially opened with its first day of classes on the morning of September 3, 1890.
The school's first principal was Fox Holden, former Superintendent of the Plattsburgh Union Graded Schools.</p>
<p>With an extensive shuffling of city services, classes were able to resume the following Wednesday at City Hall in downtown.
The longer term solution was to share facilities with a number of the city's <a>K-12</a> public schools.
These half-day schooling arrangements were necessary for the survival of Plattsburgh Normal School but proved to be too disruptive to public school students, and the practice was discontinued in September 1930.</p>
<p>By that time initial plans were finally being approved for a new structure to replace Normal Hall.
Plans were formally approved on October 10.
The new building would be located in the same location and be twice as large as the old Normal Hall.
The new structure was completed in 1932 and was named <a>Hawkins Hall</a> in honor of George K. Hawkins, the principal of Plattsburgh Normal School from 1898 to 1933.
It was listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1982.</p>
<h3>Modern era</h3>
<p>Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School was renamed <strong>SUNY Plattsburgh</strong> when it joined the <a>State University of New York</a> system with its establishment in 1948.
When the school became part of the SUNY system, it changed from a two-year teacher's institution to a selective, four-year, public <a>liberal arts college</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s SUNY Plattsburgh, as well as the whole State University of New York system, underwent rapid growth.
Many of the more modern buildings on campus were constructed during this time period, including the Angell College Center, Feinberg Library, and several high-rise dormitories.</p>
<p>Since 1978, the student population has remained relatively low, ranging between 5,900 and 6,600 matriculated students.
The lowest enrollment during this time was the fall 2004 semester, with 5,909, and the highest enrollment in the fall 1988 semester, with 6,594.</p>

Plattsburgh also has men's teams in <a>baseball</a> and <a>lacrosse</a>, and women's teams in <a>softball</a>, <a>tennis</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>.
All Plattsburgh State intercollegiate athletic teams are named either Cardinals or Lady Cardinals.</p>
<h3>Ice hockey</h3>
<p>Cardinal Hockey is by far the most notable of Plattsburgh State sports, featuring  perennial national powerhouses in both men's and women's <a>ice hockey</a>.</p>
<p>The men's hockey team has won two NCAA D-III Championships (1992 and 2001) and 18 <a>SUNYAC</a> Championships.
The women's hockey team has won two NCAA D-III Championship (2007, 2008) and two <a>ECAC</a> Western Division Championships (2006 and 2007).
The 2006-2007 Lady Cardinals' team that won the National Championship went undefeated (27-0-2); a feat accomplished for just the fourth time in NCAA hockey history (men's or women's at any level).</p>
<p>Cardinal hockey players have been named first team <a>All-Americans</a> a total of 16 times.
For the men's team, Tracey Belanger (1999), Jason Desloover (1998), Steve Moffat (1998), Joe Ferras (1987), Peter DeArmas (1985), Gaetan D'Anjou (1982), and Doug Kimura (1980, 1981) have been first team All-Americans.
For the women's team, Stephanie Moberg (2009) Bree Doyle (2006, 2007), Danielle Blanchard (2007, 2008), and Elizabeth Gibson (2004) have been first team All-Americans.
Blanchard won the Laura Hurd Award as the NCAA Division III Player of the Year in 2008.</p>
<h4>Plattsburgh/Oswego hockey rivalry</h4>
<p>In 1990, the Cardinal Hockey Boosters Club began a tradition of fans throwing hundreds of <a>tennis balls</a> on to the ice after the first SUNY Plattsburgh goal was scored against the visiting Lakers from <a>SUNY Oswego</a>.
It is believed that tennis balls were chosen because the Head Coach for Oswego's hockey team was also the school's tennis coach, and because tennis balls matched the bright yellow color of the Lakers' jerseys.
In 1998, Oswego <a>goaltender</a> Carl Antifonario  <a>shutout</a> the Cardinals in Plattsburgh, denying fans the opportunity to throw any tennis balls.
This accomplishment led to an Oswego counter-tradition of throwing hundreds of <a>bagel</a>s (representing a zero) on their home ice following the first goal scored against the Cardinals in Oswego.
The SUNY Plattsburgh tradition of throwing tennis balls at home games against Oswego lasted for 18 years but, following Oswego's lead two years earlier, it was finally ended by school administrators on January 25, 2008.

<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p>In 1904, Plattsburgh Normal College basketball team was shut out by Potsdam Normal College by a score of 123-0.</p>

Since that time, Cardinals basketball has gone to six NCAA tournaments (1975, 1995, 2006 through 2008 and 2010), including a <a>Final Four</a> appearance in 1976.&lt;!--

<h3>Campus media</h3>
<p>Cardinal Points is the name of the student-run weekly newspaper.

<h3>Resident hall councils</h3>
<p>Organized by the Office of Resident Life (headed by Bryan Hartman), each dorm is encouraged to assemble a resident hall council, each headed by a respective elected president, vice president, secretary, and so forth.
Using a budget provided from the hall life portion of tuition, hall council members acting as a small municipal body organize events, parties, barbecues, tournaments, and sometimes competitions or collaborations with other dorms on campus.
Some events have been sponsored by university police as well as the health department and other organizations to boost awareness in student-related issues such as alcohol abuse, unprotected sex, drugs, and so forth.
The hall council is often responsible for creating and maintaining dorm newsletters as well.
