<p>The <strong>University of Central Missouri</strong> (formerly  <strong>Central Missouri State University</strong>) is a four-year public institution in <a>Warrensburg, Missouri</a>.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University was founded in 1871 as <strong>State Normal School, District #2</strong> and became known as <strong>Warrensburg Teachers College</strong>.
The name was changed to <strong>Central Missouri State Teachers College</strong> in 1919, <strong>Central Missouri State College</strong> in 1946, and <strong>Central Missouri State University</strong> in 1971.
In 1965, the institution established a graduate school.
In 2005, Missouri Governor <a>Matt Blunt</a> signed into law a provision authorizing Central Missouri State University to change its name, if so desired, to the University of Central Missouri.
The University's name was changed to the University of Central Missouri on September 20, 2006.
There are 105 majors at UCM, seven of which are accredited programs in the school of technology and home of the only accredited graduate degree in technology in the United States.
Job placement at UCM is 94% after graduation and the average class size is 23.
The university has about 255 student organizations, including a speech and debate team and UCM DECA.
There are also over 58 intramural sports to compete in, free movie nights on campus, and a bowling alley in the union.
Freshman students are required to live in one of the 17 residence halls their first year with other freshman students, which eases the adjustment from high school to college.
Students can also choose to live in SHIPs (Special Housing Interest Programs), which place students with the same program of study together in the residence halls.
UCM has three off campus locations in St. Louis, Lee's Summit, and Springfield, all in Missouri, and also provides online courses.</p>

<h3>GIMPS</h3>
<p>The University of Central Missouri continues to hold an important role in the <a>Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</a>.
The GIMPS project at UCM is a university-wide effort managed by Dr. <a>Curtis Cooper</a> and Dr. <a>Steven Boone</a>.
Central's team (curtisc) is currently the No. 1 contributor to that project ([<a>http://mersenne.org/ips/tops.shtml</a>]), and is the only team that has discovered two Mersenne primes, M43 2&lt;sup&gt;30402457&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 ([<a>http://www.mersenne.org/primes/30402457.htm</a>]) with 9,152,052 digits and M44 2&lt;sup&gt;32582657&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 ([<a>http://www.mersenne.org/primes/32582657.htm</a>]) with 9,808,358 digits.</p>
<h2>Student Life</h2>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>The University of Central Missouri is home to 24 Greek organizations; recruitment takes place in both the Spring and Fall semesters.
Eleven percent of UCM students are involved in Greek life.
Sororities and fraternities contribute not only to enriching campus life at UCM, but also help improve their community by raising over $20,000 for philanthropic organizations and participating in over 15,000 hours of community service.
A Greek program known as <a>GAMMA</a> ( Greeks Advocating Mature Management of Alcohol) is a program that promotes alcohol awareness and assisted the Student Government Association with bringing the Night Rider bus to campus.

It is also the home facility for Mules golf, as well as Mules and Jennies cross country.</p>
<h2>Student privacy violations</h2>
<p>The University of Central Missouri has a poor history of protecting student privacy, with two data breaches occurring in 2009 alone.
In both cases, many thousands of students' personal information, including <a>Social Security number</a>s, dates of birth, and addresses, were stolen due to inadequate security measures.
In the first case of 2009, a former UCM police officer and his wife stole more than 7000 students' information and used that information to commit identity fraud involving more than 250 students.
In a separate case in late 2009, a student retrieved and attempted to sell thousands of records of student information to an undercover federal agent in <a>Rochester, New York</a>.</p>
