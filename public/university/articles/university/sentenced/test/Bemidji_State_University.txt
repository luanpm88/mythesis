<strong>Bemidji State University</strong> (BSU) is a public state university in <a>Bemidji, Minnesota</a>, USA, located on the shores of <a>Lake Bemidji</a>.
It is a part of <a>Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU)</a>.
BSU was founded in 1919 as Bemidji State Normal School.
The name was later changed to Bemidji State Teachers College, then shortened to Bemidji State College and finally Bemidji State University.
During the 1998-1999 academic year, the University Board of Regents recommended changing the name of the university to Minnesota State University - Bemidji, just as Moorhead State University and Mankato State University had changed their names to <a>Minnesota State University Moorhead</a> and <a>Minnesota State University, Mankato</a>, respectively.
The board argued this would emphasize the fact that BSU was a Minnesota university and thus attract more students from both in-state (who would otherwise be unaware that it was located in Minnesota) and out-of-state (who saw Minnesota as a good state in which to attend university).
Large vocal and written opposition from students, <a>alumni</a>, and local townspeople made the Board withdraw the recommendation.
Current enrollment is about 5,300 students, with students from 44 US states and 40 countries.
Each student attending BSU pays a 43 cent per credit fee to sustain the <a>Minnesota State University Student Association</a>, a student-led non-profit that advocates on behalf of all Minnesota State University Students.</p>

He served briefly as President Elect of North Dakota State University, although he was one of twelve semi-finalists, he was not one of the three finalists for the permanent position.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>Bemidji State University is becoming well-known for its programs and conferences in writing.

<h2>Foreign Programs</h2>
<p>For 16 years BSU has had a relationship with <a>Liaoning University</a>, a university in <a>China</a>.
Each year a professor from Liaoning University goes to BSU to teach Chinese and each summer BSU students participate in &quot;Sino-Summer&quot;, a month long visit to China with half of the time spent at Liaoning University and half touring other parts of China including <a>Beijing</a>, <a>Xi'an</a> and <a>Guilin</a>.
Unfortunately, in 2007 for the first time in almost two decades, no group of BSU students went to China through the Sino-Summer program.</p>
