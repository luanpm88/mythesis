<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|225px|left|University Gateway on College Green</a></p>
<p>The <a>Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787 called for educational institutions as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the <a>Ohio Territory</a>: &quot;Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot;
In 1797, settlers from <a>Marietta</a> traveled up the <a>Hocking River</a> to establish a location for the school, choosing <a>Athens</a> due to its location directly between <a>Chillicothe</a> (the original capital of <a>Ohio</a>) and <a>Marietta</a>.
Originally chartered in 1802 as the American Western University, Ohio University was founded on February 18, 1804, when its charter was approved by the Ohio General Assembly.
Its founding came 11 months after <a>Ohio</a> was admitted to the Union.
The first three students enrolled in 1808.
Ohio University graduated two students with bachelor's degrees in 1815.
In 1828, a free black man, <a>John Newton Templeton</a>, became one of the first African Americans to earn a college degree.
The four years Templeton spent at Ohio University, in which he compiled a superior academic record and became an active member of the <a>Athenian Literary Society</a>, are chronicled in the stage play <em><a>Free Man of Color</a></em> by <a>Charles Smith</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, Alumni Gateway was dedicated on the College Green, inscribed with words borrowed from the Latin inscription above the main portal to the ancient university of Padua, Italy.
The famous <a>E.W. Scripps</a> School of Journalism was established with a grant from the Scripps Foundation.
In 1975, Ohio University opened the College of Osteopathic Medicine, which remains the only college in Ohio to award the <em>Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine</em> degree.
Today the university is known for its strong journalism and visual communication programs, as well as its <a>Avionics Engineering</a> Center.
The Avionics Engineering Center, part of the Russ College of Engineering and Technology, specializes in the research, development, and evaluation of electronic navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.
The center, the largest at Ohio University, was established in 1963 to support a combination of theoreticians, technical specialists and graduate students to study navigation issues encountered in air transportation.
Ohio University is regarded as one of the best three avionics schools in the United States; the other two are <a>Princeton University</a> and <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.
Currently the university's <a>medical school</a> and college of engineering are engaging in a major collaboration to develop the Academic and Research Center funded by physician and engineering alumni.
This University is also well-known in <a>Malaysia</a> for its ties with <a>MARA University of Technology</a> in the 1980s.</p>

<h3>Scripps College of Communication</h3>
<p>The Ohio University Scripps College of Communication, on October 5, 2010, was named Ohio's first Center of Excellence in the Cultural and Societal Transformation category .
The college is made up of five schools and one research lab: <a>The E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a>, <a>The J. W. McClure School of Information and Telecommunication Systems</a>,  <a>The School of Communication Studies</a>, <a>The School of Media Arts and Studies</a> (formerly the School of Telecommunications), <a>The School of Visual Communication</a>, and the <a>Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab</a>.</p>
<p><a>Fox News</a> Chairman and CEO <a>Roger Ailes</a> gave a sizeable donation to Ohio University for a renovated student newsroom.
The new facility, set to open in spring of 2010, will double the size of the university's existing newsroom - last upgraded in the 1960s - and allow more students to participate in the school's WOUB radio station and television programs.</p>
<p>Ailes majored in radio and television while at Ohio University and served two years as manager of the school's radio station.
Since 1994 he has funded scholarships for Ohio University students in the school's telecommunications programs.</p>
<p>Ailes' fondness for OU is matched by his generosity.
Although the size of the donation was not revealed, it was described as substantial.
The 67-year-old credits the school with making him the successful man he is today.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ohio University ignited my interest in broadcasting, which became my lifetime career.
The education I received there gave me the opportunity to take on my first managerial responsibilities and provided early lessons in leadership.
I'm happy to contribute to a great university.&quot;</em>
Ailes said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The newsroom is a small part of a planned $34.4 million integrated communication facility for the college.
That project is a new building that will have more than  of assignable space, joining the adjacent, vacated former student union with the Radio-Television Building.</p>
<h4>E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</h4>
<p>One of the flagship programs of Ohio University, the <a>E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a>, is in the Scripps College of Communication.</p>

<h3>College of Business</h3>
<p>In 2011, Ohio University's College of Business was ranked 60th in the nation by Business Week.
The CoB offers nine different majors and a general business minor for students with non-business majors.
Despite University measures to increase enrollment, the CoB prides itself on staying smaller than other business schools.
All business classes are taught by professors, never graduate students.The CoB also offers an Indian MBA program for Indian students in Christ University Bangalore.</p>
<p>The Ralph and Luci Schey Sales Centre is one of only about three dozen schools in the US offering a professional sales certificate.
This certificate is open to any OU student, including those with non-business majors.</p>
<p>The Accountancy school uses the Business Activity Model (&quot;BAM&quot;) in its intermediate classes.
Designed to mimic the experiences of an auditor, Accounting students often credit BAM with preparing them for internships.
One of the authors of BAM, Connie Esmond-Kiger, was named Director of the School of Accountancy in Fall 2007.
She is also the adviser for OU's chapter of Beta Alpha Psi, the financial majors fraternity.
OU's chapter of BAP has been achieved Superior status for several years and has won several awards at the regional and national level.</p>
<p>The CoB's Student Equity Management Group, which was started in 2003, was afforded $1 million from the University to invest.
Unlike many other schools, OU's group is open to undergraduate students and is completely student run.
Since inception, the Student Equity Management Group's portfolio has increased by 51.29%, beating the S&amp;P 500 by 42.61% in that period.</p>
<p>There are 16 active student organizations in the CoB.
There are chapters of three national Business fraternities, a Christian Business Leadership organization, and societies or fraternities for almost every major.
Copeland Hall boasts six computer labs and two study lounges with computers, as well as many conference rooms and small group rooms.
Many business students strongly prefer to study and work in Copeland instead of the library.</p>
<p>The CoB requires students take five classes in the cluster format.
In the cluster, students are teamed up and complete research projects.
The students then receive a grade in all five of their classes on the project.
This program is an opportunity for students of different majors to interact and is considered a good illustration of how situations are often structured in the business world.

<p>Ohio's athletic facilities make up another important component of a winning tradition.
<a>Peden Stadium</a>, Ohio's football venue, is one of the best in the conference and the nation.
The stadium, though small in size, is big in atmosphere and tradition.
The <a>Convocation Center</a>, home of Bobcats basketball, volleyball, and wrestling, is also a great facility.
The largest basketball arena in the MAC, and one of the largest in the state, the Convo's hostile environment has allowed the Bobcats to win over 75% of their games in the facility.
The &quot;O-Zone&quot; student cheering section for men's basketball games is among the largest and most recognized in the Mid-American Conference.</p>
<p>Ohio University is also home to the nationally-acclaimed <a>Ohio University Marching 110</a> marching band which continually draws crowds at the Bobcat football and basketball games.
The band's unique use of contemporary popular music, a &quot;power high-step&quot; stop-action marching style, and high-energy choreographed dance breaks has led the band to perform at many venues throughout the years.
On October 28, 1976, the Marching 110 became the first marching band in history to perform at <a>Carnegie Hall</a>.
On January 20, 1993, the band performed for <a>President Clinton's</a> Presidential Inauguration in Washington, DC.
The band has also performed at many professional football games and has taken part in the <a>Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> in 2000 and 2005</p>
<h2>Athletics: Club Sports</h2>
<p><a>Club Sports</a> are athletic organizations offered through universities that are available to the public body of students and faculty.
There is no recruitment from high school or pre-requisite necessary for club sports.
Club sports include a variety of different sports for both genders, including co-ed sports.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>At <a>Ohio University</a>, there are 36 active athletic organizations within the <a>Department of Campus Recreation</a>.
(Ohio.edu)This is an amazing number and gives students a chance to feel a part of a team again, socialize with their peers, learn discipline/time management skills and also engaged in leadership opportunities.
Though being a member of a club sport is not as serious as being a member of a <a>varsity sport</a>, it does take commitment and dedication.
Each team is student run, which means that there are many positions that students need to fill but also be trained in.
<a>President</a>, <a>vice president</a>, <a>treasurer</a>, <a>safety officer</a> and <a>fund-raising chair</a> are the official positions that each team has to fill, but there is also community service chair, social chair, and even apparel chair (for team outfits)that every team has as well.
Each position has to attend training sessions to learn their own personal duties and roles; and presidents and treasurers must take an exam with the department of student involvement to ensure they understand their job.
It is extremely important that each student take their role seriously because paper work and deadlines are mandatory and can lead a team to being suspended or fined.
</p>
<h3>Four tiers</h3>
<p>There are four tiers in the Ohio University Club Sports department; instructional tier, white tier, green tier and red tier.
The difference between each tier is the importance of the sport.
Depending on the number of members on the team, the dues they collect, the fundraising they incur and the community service hours they participate in determines which tier the sport resides in.
The higher tier the sport is in, the more money that the team receives from the school and also the higher priority that team gets.
Each team can choose to move up a tier if they feel their members can meet that tier&#x2019;s standards.
</p>
<h3>Rules and regulations</h3>
<p>Club Sports is a well established organization at Ohio University and strives to make sure they are meeting all the requirements to comply with University guidelines.
As stated earlier there are many rules and regulations that teams have to follow.
In order to cooperate with the guidelines, paper work needs to be submitted by a certain due date and certain meeting must be attended.
Forms due for each club sport consist of Excellence/developmental funding request, club sports re-registration, campus life re-registration, end of the year report, treasurer&#x2019;s report, quarterly practice and traveling schedules, <a>roster</a>, <a>budget</a>, and electronic copy of team&#x2019;s <a>bylaws</a> and <a>constitution</a>.
Meetings that members of each team must attend consist of General Session, End of the Year Business Meeting, New Offices Training, Club Sports Annual Awards Banquet and Presidents workshops.</p>

<p> The John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after John Calhoun Baker, the 14th president of Ohio University.
The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green.
The $65 million student center is operated by the Division of Student Affairs and serves students, faculty, administrators, visitors and Athens community members.
</p>
<p>The five-story facility has been praised for its visual appeal.
The building features <a>Georgian-style architecture</a> and expansive windows throughout that offer spectacular views of campus and allow a great deal of natural light to enter.
In contrast to the exterior's red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high ceilings, ergonomic furniture and a color scheme of sage, plum and mocha.
The building&#x2019;s planners aimed to connect the campus with the design and structure of the student center by incorporating an escalator system (the only one in Athens County), which cuts through the main atrium of the building and connects the upper and lower portions of campus.
</p>
<p>Baker University Center contains a large food court (West 82), a fine dining restaurant (Latitude 39), a Ballroom, a bookstore and student shop (Bobcat Essentials), a theater, study areas, computer labs, a billiards lounge, administrative offices and numerous conference rooms.
The Front Room, a large coffee house serving Starbucks products and bakery items, is housed on the fourth floor and opens onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Street, making it a hot spot for students between classes.
Other amenities include a United States Post Office, the Trisolini art gallery and a tech depot that sells computer and accessories and offers students tech help.</p>
<p>The design of the facility has garnered several honors.
In 2007, Baker University Center won two <a>Golden Trowel awards</a> from the International Masonry Institute, including the grand prize of Best Project in Ohio for its <a>terrazzo floor art</a> and another prize for its <a>distinctive interior masonry features</a>.
In 2008, Baker University Center was awarded the grand prize with honors from <a>Learning by Design</a>, an organization that recognizes excellence in educational facilities.
The facility also earned the <a>2008 Facility Design Award</a> from the Association of College Unions International, which annually distinguishes excellence in the design of student unions and other student-centered building on college campuses.</p>
<p>Sujit Chemburkar currently serves as the executive director of Baker University Center.
Angela Davis is the associate director for operations.
Several other departments within the facility support the center&#x2019;s operations.
Event Services, which coordinates events held in the facility as well as in other venues on campus, is headed by Associate Director Kristin Stanley, Assistant Directors Nikki Ohms and Caitlin Barnhardt, and Reservations Coordinator Jennifer Coen.
The Technical Production department is managed by Interim Associate Director Jeremy Schaffer and Interim Technical Coordinator Ben Brown.
The Guest Services department is headed by Lureen Bailey, administrative assistant, and the Event Services Administration department is headed by Tim Epley, business manager, and Judy Martin, administrative assistant.
A number of students support each of the above departments in various contexts.
(All positions are for the 2010 - 2011 academic year.)</p>
<p>Baker University Center has a variety of <a>spaces</a> that can be reserved by students, student organizations, university affiliates and external users.
These include the Baker Ballroom, Multipurpose room, conference rooms, lounges, promotional tables and display spaces.</p>

<h3>Alden Library</h3>
<p>Vernon R. Alden Library serves the Athens campus as the central library facility; the building can seat 3,000 people.
The collection of the Ohio University library contains over 2.3 million units of microfilm material, 13,500 periodical subscriptions and 3 million printed volumes</p>
<h2>Presidents</h2>

<p></p>
<p><strong>&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;</strong> Edwin Watts Chubb was acting president for one year in 1920 when President Ellis died and again in 1934 when President Bryan died.</p>
<h2>School mascot</h2>
<p>The University Mascot is 'Rufus' the bobcat.
In 2006, Ohio University alumus Michael A Massa formally suggested to the university that the university provide a proper name and identity to the generic bobcat mascot.
The university held a university-wide competition to select a name and 'Rufus' was the popular choice.
The name reflects the scientific name of the North American bobcat (<em><a>Lynx rufus</a></em>).</p>
<h2>School folklore</h2>
<p> Ohio University is known in state folklore as the most haunted college campus in the entire United States, if not the world.
Established in 1804, the university is quite old by Ohio's standards, which only adds to its ghostly reputation.
A large number of places on campus are said to be haunted, and numerous other popular tales are told about the university across Athens county.
</p>
<p>The <a>British Society for Psychical Research</a> claims that Athens, Ohio, is one of the most haunted places in the world.
Fox at one point also taped an episode of its <em><a>Scariest Places On Earth</a></em> program at OU.</p>
<p>Many of the ghost stories associated with Athens and the University center around the former <a>Athens Lunatic Asylum</a> and the horrors that supposedly went on there.
Two notable examples of alleged local hauntings are a statue of an angel in the cemetery on West State St which is said to be crying, and the spirit of a civil war veteran called Michael Ward, who chants names of the university's students.</p>
