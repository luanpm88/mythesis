In 2007, in the line of the excellence initiative, RWTH Aachen was chosen by DFG as one of nine German <a>Universities of Excellence</a> for its future concept <em>RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges</em> and additionally won funding for one graduate school and three clusters of excellence</p>
<p>The university maintains close links to <a>industry</a> and accounts for the highest amount of third-party funds of all German universities and places second in relative funds per faculty member.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On January 25, 1858, prince <a>Frederic William of Prussia</a>, the later <a>German emperor</a>, was presented a donation of 5,000 <a>talers</a> for charity, raised by the <em>Aachener und M&#x00fc;nchener Feuer-Versicherungs-Gesellschaft</em>, the precursor of the <a>AachenM&#x00fc;nchener</a> <a>insurance company</a>.
In March, the prince chose to use the donation to found the first <a>Prussia</a>n <a>institute of technology</a> somewhere in the <a>Rhine province</a>.
The seat of the institution remained undecided over years; while the prince initially favored <a>Koblenz</a>, the cities of <a>Aachen</a>, <a>Bonn</a>, <a>Cologne</a> and <a>D&#x00fc;sseldorf</a> also applied, with Aachen and Cologne being the main competitors.
Aachen finally won with a financing concept backed by the insurance company and local banks.
<a>Groundbreaking</a> for the new <em>Polytechnikum</em> took place on May 15, 1865 and <a>lectures</a> started amidst the <a>Franco-Prussian War</a> on October 10, 1870 with 223 <a>students</a> and 32 teachers.
Its primary purpose was to educate engineers, especially for the mining industry in the <a>Ruhr area</a>; there were schools of <a>chemistry</a>, <a>electrical</a> and <a>mechanical engineering</a> as well as an introductory <em>general school</em> that taught <a>mathematics</a> and <a>natural sciences</a> and few <a>social sciences</a>.</p>
<p><a>250px|right|thumb|Main building of RWTH Aachen University</a></p>
<p>The first years were characterized by the unclear position of the new Prussian <em>polytechnika</em> (which officially were no <a>universities</a>).
Their reputation in society was low and the number of students decreased.
This began to change in 1880 when the early RWTH, amongst others, was reorganized as a <em>Royal Technical University</em>, gained a seat in the <a>Prussian House of Lords</a> and was finally granted the right to bestow PhD (1898) degrees and <a>Diplom</a> titles (introduced in 1902).
The same year, over 800 male students had been enrolled; the first women were admitted in 1909.
<a>World War&nbsp;I</a>, however, was a serious setback for the university.
Many students voluntarily joined and died in the war and parts of the university were shortly occupied or confiscated.</p>
<p>While the (then no more royal) <em>TH Aachen</em> flourished in the 1920s with the introduction of the more independent <a>faculties</a>, several new institutes and the <a>general students' committee</a>, first signs of <a>nationalist</a> radicalization were also visible within the university.
The <a>Third Reich</a>'s <a>Gleichschaltung</a> of the TH in 1933 was met with relatively low resistance from both students and faculty.
Beginning in September 1933, <a>Jewish</a> and (alleged) <a>Communist</a> professors (and from 1937 on also students) were systematically <a>persecuted</a> and excluded from the university.
Vacant <a>Chairs</a> were increasingly given to <a>NSDAP</a> party members or sympathizers.
The freedom of research and teaching was severely limited and institutes important for the regime's plans were systematically established, existing chairs promoted.
Shortly closed in 1939, the TH continued courses in 1940, although with a low number of students.
On October 21, 1944, when Aachen <a>capitulated</a>, more than 70% of all buildings of the university were destroyed or heavily damaged.</p>
<p>After <a>World War II</a>, the university recovered and expanded quickly.
In the 1950s, many professors who had been removed because of their alleged affiliation with the <a>Nazi party</a> were allowed to return and a multitude of new institutes were founded.
By the late 1960s, the TH had 10,000 students, placing it on top of all German technical universities.
With the foundation of a <a>philosophical</a> and a <a>medical</a> faculty in 1965 and 1966, respectively, the university became a bit more &quot;universal&quot;.
It was especially the newly-founded faculties that began attracting new students, and the number of students almost doubled twice from 1970 (10,000) to 1980 (more than 25,000) and from 1980 to 1990 (more than 37,000).
Today, the average number of students is around 30,000, with exactly one third of all students being women in the <a>winter term</a> of 2007/2008.</em></p>
<p>In 2007, RWTH Aachen was chosen as one of nine German <a>Universities of Excellence</a> for its future concept <em>RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges</em>, earning it the <a>connotation</a> of being an <em><a>elite</a> university</em>.
However, although the list of universities honored for their future concepts mostly consists of large and already respected institutions, the <a>Federal Ministry of Education and Research</a> claimed that the initiative was aimed at promoting universities with a dedicated future concept so they could continue researching on an international level.
Having won funds in all three lines of funding, the process brought RWTH Aachen University an additional total funding of <a>&euro;</a> 180 <a>million</a> from 2007-2011.
The other two lines of funding were <a>graduate schools</a>, where the </em>Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in <a>Computational Engineering Science</a><em> received funding and so-called &quot;clusters of excellence&quot;, where RWTH Aachen managed to win funding for the three clusters </em>Ultra High-Speed Mobile Information and Communication (UMIC)<em>, </em>Integrative Production Technology for High-wage Countries<em> and </em>Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass (TMFB)<em>.</em></p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The RWTH is not a campus university.
Instead, its buildings are spread over some parts of the city.
There are two core areas (midtown and Melaten district), though they are not very distinct.
The Main Building and the <a>K&#x00e1;rm&#x00e1;n</a> Hall are 500&nbsp;m away from the city centre with the <a>Aachen Cathedral</a>, the Audimax (biggest lecture hall) and the main refectory are 200&nbsp;m farther.
Other points of interest include the university's <a>botanical garden</a> (<a>Botanischer Garten Aachen</a>).</p>
<p>The RWTH has external facilities in <a>J&#x00fc;lich</a> and <a>Essen</a> and owns, together with the <a>University of Stuttgart</a>, a house in <a>Kleinwalsertal</a> in the <a>Austria</a>n <a>Alps</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumbnail|200px|Main Building of the RWTH Aachen</a></p>
<p>The university is currently expanding in the city center and Melaten district.
The SuperC, the new central service building for students, was opened in 2008.
The groundbreaking for the new <em>Campus-Melaten</em> will be in 2009.</p>
<p><a>thumbnail|200px|SuperC</a></p>
<h2>Internationality</h2>
<p>Double degrees and student mobility are promoted with other technology universities through the TIME (<a>Top Industrial Managers for Europe</a>) network.
Furthermore the RWTH is member of the <a>IDEA League</a>, which is a strategic partnership among five of Europe's leading research universities, including <a>TU Delft</a>, <a>Imperial College London</a>, <a>ETH Z&#x00fc;rich</a> and <a>ParisTech</a>  and was the first German university starting an <a>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> in 2008.</p>
<p>Compared to other German universities the RWTH Aachen received the highest amount of funds granted by third-party donors in the last years.</p>
<p>Almost 5,200 international students are currently enrolled within the undergraduate, graduate or PhD programme.
Compared to other German universities the portion of international students at the RWTH Aachen is higher-than-average.
The proximity of Aachen to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg combined with the subsequent exposure to a variety of cultural heritages has placed RWTH Aachen University in a unique position with regards to the reflection and promotion of international aspects and intensive interaction with other universities.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the university 158th in the world, making it the eighth highest ranked university in Germany.
Its global subject rankings were: 39th in Engineering &amp; IT, 257th in Life Sciences &amp; Biomedicine, 59th in Natural Sciences, and 283rd in Social Sciences.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>RWTH Aachen is run by the <a>federal state</a> of <a>North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. Since the summer semester of 2004 the state of North Rhine-Westphalia allowed universities to request a maximum of 500&#x20ac; per semester as tuition fees.
Since the summer semester of 2007, all students enrolled at the RWTH Aachen have to pay these 500&#x20ac;, if they are not exempt for one of several reasons put forth by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In the past, tuition fees applied solely for long-term students and second studies.
Almost all basic lectures are held in <a>German</a>, but an increasing number of graduate programs are offered in English.
<a>thumbnail|200px|Institute for physical chemistry</a></p>
<p>The RWTH is divided into nine (previously ten) faculties: </p>
<p>Faculty nine was <a>pedagogical science</a>s, but it was abandoned in 1989.
<a>Teacher education</a>, however, continued.</p>
