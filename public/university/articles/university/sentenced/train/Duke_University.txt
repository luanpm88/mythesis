<p>  <strong>Duke University</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Durham, North Carolina</a>, <a>United States</a>.
Founded by <a>Methodists</a> and <a>Quakers</a> in the present-day town of <a>Trinity</a> in 1838, the school moved to <a>Durham</a> in 1892.
In 1924, tobacco industrialist <a>James Buchanan Duke</a> established <a>The Duke Endowment</a>, prompting the institution to change its name in honor of his deceased father, <a>Washington Duke</a>.</p>
<p>The University is organized into two <a>undergraduate</a>, ten <a>graduate</a> and professional schools, and seven institutes.
In its 2011 edition, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the university's undergraduate program 9th among national universities, while ranking the <a>medical</a>, <a>law</a>, <a>public affairs</a>, <a>nursing</a> and <a>business</a> graduate programs as high as 6th and as low as 15th, all among the top 15 in the United States.
Duke University is also ranked 14th in the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>.
</p>
<p>Duke's research expenditures are among the largest ten in the U.S.A. Competing in the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a>, Duke's <a>athletic teams</a> have twelve <a>national championships</a>, including four by <a>its men's basketball team</a>.</p>
<p>Besides academics, research, and athletics, Duke is also well known for its sizable campus and <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture, especially the <a>Duke Chapel</a>.
The forests surrounding parts of the campus belie the University's proximity to downtown Durham.
Duke's 8,610&nbsp;acres (35&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) contain three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in <a>Beaufort</a>.
Construction projects have updated both the freshmen-populated <a>Georgian-style</a> East Campus and the main Gothic-style West Campus, as well as the adjacent <a>Medical Center</a> over the past five years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p><a>thumb|One of the first buildings on the original Durham campus (East Campus), the Washington Duke Building (&quot;Old Main&quot;) was destroyed by a fire in 1911.</a>
Duke started as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in 1838, in <a>Randolph County</a> in the present-day town of <a>Trinity</a>.
Brown's Schoolhouse was organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of <a>Methodists</a> and <a>Quakers</a>, and in 1841 North Carolina issued a charter for Union Institute Academy.
The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the <a>Methodist Church</a>.</p>
<p>In 1924, Washington Duke's son, <a>James B. Duke</a>, established <a>The Duke Endowment</a> with a $40 million ($434 million in <a>2005 dollars</a>) trust fund.
The annual income of the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, three colleges, and Trinity College.
<a>William Preston Few</a>, the president of Trinity College, insisted that the university be named Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish itself from the myriad of other colleges and universities carrying the &quot;Trinity&quot; name.
At first, James B. Duke thought the name change might come off as self-serving, but eventually he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father.

<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p>Engineering, which had been taught since 1903, became a <a>separate school</a> in 1939.
In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the only <a>Rose Bowl</a> ever played outside California in <a>Wallace Wade Stadium</a> in 1942.
On June 2, 1963, the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college.
Increased <a>activism</a> on campus during the 1960s prompted <a>Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> to speak at the University on the civil rights movement's progress on November 13, 1964.
The former <a>governor of North Carolina</a>, <a>Terry Sanford</a>, was elected president in 1969, propelling <a>The Fuqua School of Business</a>'s opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the <a>Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs</a> (now the Sanford School of Public Policy).
The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the <a>liberal arts</a> college for both men and women in 1972.
Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally.
Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students.
<a>Duke University Hospital</a> was finished in 1980 and the student union was fully constructed two years later.
In 1986, the men's <a>soccer</a> team captured Duke's first <a>NCAA</a> championship, and the men's <a>basketball</a> team shortly followed with championships in <a>1991</a>, <a>1992</a>, <a>2001</a> and <a>2010</a>.]]</p>
<p>Duke University's growth and academic focus have contributed to the university's reputation as an academic and research powerhouse.
The school has regularly sent three-member teams to the <a>William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition</a>, earning the title of the best collegiate undergraduate math team in the United States and Canada in 1993, 1996 and 2000.
In recent years Duke's team has regularly finished in the top five.</p>
<p>Construction continued on campus, with the  <a>Levine Science Research Center</a> (LSRC) opening in 1994 to house interdisciplinary research.
These projects have updated both the freshmen-housed Georgian-style East Campus and the main Gothic-style West Campus, as well as the adjacent <a>Medical Center</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>In 1998, Duke President <a>Nan Keohane</a> initiated a five-year $1.5 billion Campaign for Duke fundraising effort.
<a>Edmund T. Pratt, Jr.</a> ('47) endowed the <a>Pratt School of Engineering</a> with a $35 million gift in 1999.
The Campaign for Duke ended in 2003 with $2.36 billion raised, making it the fifth largest campaign in the history of American higher education.</p>
<p>In the 2008 fiscal year, research expenditures surpassed $766 million.
The first working demonstration of an invisibility cloak was unveiled by Duke researchers in October 2006.
In 2002 and 2006, three students were named <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, a number surpassed by only one other university both years.
Overall, Duke has produced 42 Rhodes Scholars, including 21 in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Duke established a partnership with the <a>National University of Singapore</a> to develop a joint medical program, which had its first entering class in 2007.
In 2006, three lacrosse team members were <a>falsely accused of rape</a>.
Charges against the players were later dropped and the initial prosecutor was disbarred for ethical improprieties.
The incident garnered <a>significant media attention</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:Divinitychapelduke.jpg|right|thumb|Part of the [[Duke Divinity School|Divinity School]] addition, Goodson Chapel]] Duke University owns 220 buildings on 8,610&nbsp;acres (35&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land, which includes the 7,200&nbsp;acre (29&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) Duke Forest.
The campus is divided into four main areas: West, East, and Central campuses, and the Medical Center.
All the campuses are connected via a free bus service or the <a>Duke University Medical Center Patient Rapid Transit</a> people mover.
On the <a>Atlantic</a> coast in <a>Beaufort</a>, Duke owns  as part of its Marine Lab.
One of the major public attractions on the Duke Campus is the  <a>Sarah P. Duke Gardens</a>, established in the 1930s.
Much of the campus was designed by <a>Julian Abele</a>, one of the first prominent African American architects.
The residential quadrangles are of an early and somewhat unadorned design, while the buildings in the academic quadrangles show influences of the more elaborate late French and Italian styles.
Its freshman campus (East Campus) is composed of buildings in the Georgian architecture style.
<a>Duke Chapel</a> stands at the heart of West Campus.
Constructed from 1930 to 1935, the chapel seats 1,600 people; and, at 210&nbsp;feet (64&nbsp;m), is one of the tallest buildings in <a>Durham County</a>.</p>
<p>As of <a>November 1</a>, 2005, Duke had spent $835 million on 34 major construction projects initiated since February 2001.
At that time, Duke initiated a five-year strategic plan, &quot;Building on Excellence.&quot;
Completed projects since 2002 include major additions to the business, law, nursing, and divinity schools, a new library, an art museum, a football training facility, two residential buildings, an engineering complex, a public policy building, an eye institute, two genetic research buildings, a student plaza, the <a>French Family</a> Science Center, and two new medical-research buildings.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|The Gothic Reading Room of Perkins Library</a></p>
<h3>Libraries and museums</h3>
<p> With more than six million <a>volumes</a>, the <a>Duke University Library System</a> is one of the ten largest private research university library systems in the U.S. and is the 22nd largest among members of the Association of Research Libraries.
In addition to the six million volumes there are 17.7 million <a>manuscript</a>s, 1.2 million public documents, and tens of thousands of films and videos.
Besides the main William R. Perkins Library complex, the university library system also includes the separately administered Ford (business), <a>Divinity School</a>, Goodson Law, and <a>Medical Center</a> Libraries.</p>
<p>The William R. Perkins Library system comprises the Perkins Library complex (Perkins Library, Bostock Library, Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library and University Archives, and the von der Heyden Pavilion), Lilly Library (which houses materials on <a>fine arts</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, film &amp; video, and <a>performing arts</a>), the <a>Music</a> Library, and the Pearse Memorial Library (located at the <a>Marine</a> Lab).</p>
<p><a>Nasher Museum of Art</a> was designed by <a>Rafael Vi&#x00f1;oly</a> and is named for Duke alumnus and art collector <a>Raymond Nasher</a>.
The museum opened in 2005 at a cost of over $23 million, and contains over 13,000 works of art, including works by <a>Andy Warhol</a>, <a>Barkley L. Hendricks</a>, <a>Christian Marclay</a>, <a>Dario Robleto</a> and <a>Kara Walker</a>.</p>
<h3>West, East, and Central Campuses</h3>
<p> West Campus, the heart of Duke University, houses all the sophomores, along with some juniors and seniors.
East Campus, the original location of Duke University, </p>
<p>Central Campus, consisting of  between East and West campuses, houses around 850 juniors and seniors and 200 professional students in apartments.
At present, there is a 20- to 50-year plan to restructure Central Campus.
The idea is to develop an &quot;academic village&quot; as a key center for the Duke community.
The first phase will involve replacing the apartments.
Other additions in that phase are expected to include dining, academic, recreational, and service facilities.
A key goal of the Central renovations is to reintegrate the area with the rest of the Duke campus, as it is connected to the other campuses by a circuitous, inefficient bus route.</p>
<h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The <a>36th parallel north</a> goes through the residential area of the West Campus, and the Campus Drive street that connects the campuses together winds about the 36th parallel several times.
The <a>Duke Gardens</a> has a &quot;36th Parallel Club&quot; although the garden itself is just north of the parallel.
The three most major <a>latitude</a>/<a>longitude</a> coordinate points on or near Duke's main campuses in decimal degrees, are 36&#x00b0;N 78.94&#x00b0;W which is in the Kilgo quadrangle courtyard, 36&#x00b0;N 78.93&#x00b0;W which is on Campus Drive right near the intersection with Anderson Street, and 36&#x00b0;N 78.92&#x00b0;W which is on Campus Drive.
In degrees/minutes/seconds, the major gridpoint is at 36&deg;N 78&deg;56'W which is next to the admissions office.</p>
<h3>Key places</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|The Sarah P. Duke Gardens attract more than 300,000 visitors each year.</a>
Duke Forest, established in 1931, today consists of 7,200&nbsp;acres (29&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) in six divisions, just west of Duke University's West Campus.
It is one of the largest continually managed forests in the U.S. and demonstrates a variety of forest stand types and <a>silvicultural</a> treatments.
Duke Forest is used extensively for research and includes the Aquatic Research Facility, Forest Carbon Transfer and Storage (FACTS-I) research facility, two permanent towers suitable for micrometerological studies, and other areas designated for animal behavior and ecosystem study.
More than 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) of trails are open to the public for hiking, cycling, and horseback riding.</p>
<p>The <a>Duke Lemur Center</a>, located inside the Duke Forest, is the world's largest sanctuary for rare and endangered <a>prosimian</a> <a>primate</a>s.
Founded in 1966, the Duke Lemur Center spans 85&nbsp;acres (3.44&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) and contains nearly 300 animals of 25 different species of <a>lemur</a>s, <a>galago</a>s and <a>loris</a>es.</p>
<p>[[File:MedicalCenter.jpg|left|thumb|Entrance to the [[Duke University Medical Center|Medical Center]] from West Campus]] The <a>Sarah P. Duke Gardens</a>, established in the early 1930s, is situated between West Campus and the apartments of Central Campus.
The gardens occupy 55 acres (2.2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), divided into four major sections: the original Terraces and their surroundings; the H.L. Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, devoted to flora of the Southeastern United States; the W.L. Culberson Asiatic Arboretum, housing plants of Eastern Asia, as well as disjunct species found in both Eastern Asia and Eastern North America; and the Doris Duke Center Gardens.
There are five miles (8&nbsp;km) of all&#x00e9;es and paths throughout Gardens.</p>
<p><a>Duke University Medical Center</a>, located directly north of West Campus, combines one of the top-rated hospitals and one of the top-ranked <a>medical schools</a> in the U.S. Founded in 1930, the Medical Center occupies 8 million square feet (700,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) in 99 buildings on 210&nbsp;acres (8.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;).</p>
<p>Duke University Marine Lab, although located in the town of <a>Beaufort, North Carolina</a>, is also part of Duke's campus.
The marine lab is situated on Pivers Island on the <a>Outer Banks</a> of North Carolina, only  across the channel from Beaufort.
Duke's interest in the area began in the early 1930s and the first buildings were erected in 1938.
The resident faculty represent the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine biomedicine, marine biotechnology, and coastal marine policy and management.
The Marine Laboratory is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML).</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|East Campus' Union building, home to the freshman dining hall</a> Duke requires its students to live on campus for the first three years of undergraduate life, except for a small percentage of second semester juniors who are exempted by a lottery system.
This requirement is justified by the administration as an effort to help students connect more closely with one another and sustain a sense of belonging within the Duke community.
Thus, 85% of undergraduates live on campus.
All freshmen are housed in one of 14 residences on East Campus.
These buildings range in occupancy size from 50 (Epworth&#x2014;the oldest residence hall, built in 1892 as &quot;the Inn&quot;) to 190 residents (Gilbert-Addoms).
Most of these are in the Georgian style typical of the East Campus architecture.
Although the newer residence halls differ in style, they still relate to East&#x2019;s Georgian heritage.
Two learning communities, the Performing Arts Community and East Campus Wellness, connect the residential component of East Campus with students of similar academic and social interests.
Similarly, students in the <a>Focus program</a>, a first-year program that features courses clustered around a specific theme, live together in the same residence halls.</p>
<p>The vast majority of sophomores reside on West Campus, but they may also elect to live on Central Campus.
Juniors and seniors can choose to live on West or Central.
West Campus contains six quadrangles&#x2014;the four along &quot;Main&quot; West were built in 1930&#x2019;s, while two newer ones have since been added.
West Campus is home to three learning communities including West Campus Wellness, a substance-free section, and the Baldwin Scholars program.
These groups are allocated &quot;sections&quot; of the quadrangles, thereby living close to one another, but still within the context of a larger community.
Also, 25 &quot;selective living groups&quot; are housed within sections on West, including 15 <a>fraternities</a>.
Nine of the 11 non-fraternity selective living groups are coeducational.
Central Campus provides housing for approximately 1,050 students (of which about 850 are undergraduate juniors or seniors) in 45 apartment buildings.
About half of Duke seniors, however, choose to live off campus.</p>
<h3>Greek and social life</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Cameron Crazies gathering in K-ville</a> About 30% of undergraduate men and about 40% of undergraduate women at Duke are members of <a>fraternities and sororities</a>.
In addition, four other fraternities and sororities form the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization.
Duke also has 11 Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students wanting self-selecting living arrangements.
Selective Living Groups at Duke are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities but are generally co-ed, housed on Central and West Campus, and unaffiliated with any national organizations.
Fraternity chapters frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.</em></p>
<p>In the late-1990s, a new keg policy was put into effect that requires all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services.
According to administrators, the rule change was intended as a way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety.
Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke.
As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies.
Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations.
Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers.
The administration has been very active in the past few years with efforts to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially the Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities.
In March 2006, the university also purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented.
These houses are now owned by individual families who live in them, including the Dean of Duke Chapel.</p>
<p>Duke athletics, particularly basketball, is a significant component of Duke's student life.
Duke's students have been recognized as some of the most creative and original fans in all of collegiate athletics.
Students, often referred to as <a>Cameron Crazies</a>, show their support of the men's basketball team by &quot;tenting&quot; for home games against key <a>ACC</a> rivals, especially <a>UNC</a>.
Because tickets to all varsity sports are free to students, they line up for hours before each game, often spending the night on the sidewalk.
For a mid-February game against UNC, some of the most eager students might even begin tenting before spring classes begin.
The total number of participating tents is capped at 100 (each tent can have up to 12 occupants), though interest is such that it could exceed that number if space permitted.
Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near <a>Cameron Indoor Stadium</a>, an area known as <a>Krzyzewskiville</a>, or K-ville for short.
There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent.
At night, K-ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert.
The men's basketball coach, <a>Mike Krzyzewski</a>, is known to buy pizza on occasion for the inhabitants of the tent village.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<h4>Student organizations</h4>
<p></em>[[File:New buildings 002.jpg|thumb|Duke's
West Campus Union building has restaurants, offices, and some administrative departments.
<em>[[The Chronicle (Duke University)|The Chronicle]]<strong>s administrative office, the Mary Lou Williams Center for <a>Black</a> Culture, and the Center for <a>LGBT</a> Life are all located in the Union.]]</strong>
Approximately more than 500 student clubs and organizations operate on Duke's campus.
These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations.
Chartered by the Board of Trustees, the most prominent amongst these are the Duke Student Government, the Duke University Union, and Campus Council.
Duke Student Government (DSG) subsequently charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.
The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.
Campus Council is the school's residential student government, specializing in programming, policy, and facilities and services.
Cultural groups are also provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center as well as other institutional funding sources.
One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports.
Duke has 35 sports clubs and 29 intramural teams that are officially recognized.
Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups such as the Duke Pitchforks, student bands such as <a>Alan Davis Band</a>, and <a>Duke University Improv</a> are also prominent on campus.
The Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee, or DUSDAC, provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.</p>
<p>Cultural groups on campus include: the Asian Students Association, Blue Devils United (the student lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group), Black Student Alliance, Diya (South Asian Association), Jewish Life at Duke, Mi Gente (Latino Student Association), International Association/International Council, Muslim Student Association, Native American Student Coalition, Newman Catholic Student Center, Languages Dorm, and Students of the Caribbean.</p>
<h4>Civic engagement</h4>
<p>[[File:VonderHeydenPavillion.jpg|thumb|The
[[Karl von der Heyden|von der Heyden]] Pavilion is a popular place among students for gathering and studying.]]
According to <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>, Duke is one of 81 institutions in the country with outstanding community service programs.
In 2008, Duke received the Community Engagement Classification from <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> for the Advancement of Teaching.
In February 2007, Duke launched DukeEngage, a $30 million civic engagement program that allows undergraduates to participate in an in-depth service opportunity over the course of a summer or semester.
The program's scope has been called &quot;unprecedented in U.S. higher education.&quot;
In addition, Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area.
Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients (<a>Camp Kesem</a>) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, alcohol and drug use, and eating disorders (Healthy Devils).
The Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources.
Another community project, &quot;Scholarship with a Civic Mission,&quot; is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the <a>Kenan Institute for Ethics</a>.
Other programs include: Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; an after-school program for at-risk students in Durham that was started with $2.25 million grant from the <a>Kellogg Foundation</a> in 2002; and Project BUILD, a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, and homeless shelters.
Some courses at Duke incorporate service as part of the curriculum to augment material learned in class such as in psychology or education courses (known as service learning courses).</p>
<h4>Student media</h4>
<p> <em><a>The Chronicle</a></em>, Duke's independent undergraduate daily newspaper, has been continually published since 1905 and has a readership of about 30,000.
Its editors are responsible for selecting the term &quot;<a>Blue Devil</a>&quot;.
The newspaper won Best in Show in the tabloid division at the 2005 Associated Collegiate Press National College Media Convention.
<a>Cable 13</a>, established in 1976, is Duke's student-run television station.
It stands as a popular activity for students interested in film production and media.
<a>WXDU-FM</a>, licensed in 1983, is the University's nationally recognized, noncommercial FM radio station, operated by student and community volunteers.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  [[File:Duke Blue Devil mascot cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Duke
Blue Devils]] mascot.
This is an older design; an updated mascot was introduced in 2008.]]
Duke's 26 varsity sports teams, known as the <a>Blue Devils</a>, are members of the <a>NCAA's</a> <a>Division I</a> <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a>.
Athletic teams at the school had no moniker until approximately 1924 when the school's newspaper, The Trinity Chronicle, decided upon &quot;Blue Devils&quot; as the name after a much maligned democratic effort to select a name in the previous year.
Historically, Duke's major <a>rival</a> has been the <a>Tar Heels</a> of the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, especially in basketball.
<a>The rivalry</a> has led people to identify the two differing shades of blue in relation to their respective university&#x2014;calling the lighter powder blue &quot;<a>Carolina blue</a>&quot; and the darker blue &quot;<a>Duke blue</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Duke has finished in the top 30 every year in the <a>NACDA</a> <a>Directors' Cup</a>, an overall measure of an institution's athletic success.
In the past six years, Duke has finished 10th (2010), 17th (2009), 19th (2008), 11th (2007), eighth (2006), and fifth (2005).
Duke teams that have been ranked in the top ten nationally in the 2000s include men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's fencing, men's and women's cross country running, men's and women's lacrosse, women's field hockey, and men's and women's golf.
Eight of these teams were ranked either first or second in the country during 2004&#x2013;05.
Women's golf has been particularly dominating, compiling a record of 796-45-3 (.945) in the 2000&#x2013;2005 seasons.
Duke has won 114 ACC Championships, 44 of which have come since 1999-2000 (through 2008-09).
The men's lacrosse program has been one of the most successful in the nation recently&#x2014;it has ranked in the top 15 in the country in five of the last six last participating seasons and reached the national championship game in 2005 and 2007, losing to <a>The Johns Hopkins University</a> by a single goal and accumulating season records of 17-3 both times.
Duke Men's Lacrosse finally won its first national championship on May 31, 2010.</p>
<p>According to a 2006 evaluation conducted by the NCAA, Duke's student-athletes have the highest graduation rate of any institution in the nation.
In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Duke ranked first among Division I schools in the National Collegiate Scouting Association Power Rankings&#x2014;a combination of the institution's Director's Cup standing, its athletic graduation rate, and its academic rank in <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report.</em></p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> [[File:Cameron indoor.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Duke's
famous [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]]]] Duke's men's basketball team is one of the nation's most successful basketball programs.
The team has captured four <a>National Championships</a> (fifth place all time), while attending 15 <a>Final Fours</a> (third place overall) and 10 Championship games (tied for second place with Kentucky).
Duke has the most Atlantic Coast Conference championships with 18 and has the most National Players of the Year in the nation with 11.
Seventy-two players have been selected in the <a>NBA Draft</a>, while 32 players have been honored as <a>All-America</a>ns. Duke's program is one of only two to have been to at least one Final Four and one National Championship game in each of the past five decades.
The program's home facility is historic <a>Cameron Indoor Stadium</a>, considered one of the top venues in the nation.</p>
<p>The team's success has been particularly outstanding over the past 30 years under coach <a>Mike Krzyzewski</a> (often simply called &quot;Coach K&quot;) who also has coached the <a>USA men's national basketball team</a> since 2006 and led to team to Olympic gold in 2008 and to World Championship gold in 2010.
Their successes include becoming the only team to win four national championships since the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> field was expanded to 64 teams in 1985, 11 <a>Final Four</a>s in the past 25 years, and eight of nine ACC tournament championships from 1999 to 2006.
Fourteen of its alumni play in the NBA as of the 2010 season, making Duke tied for the highest number among college teams.</p>
<p>[[File:Wallace Wade Stadium 2005 Virginia Tech at Duke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wallace Wade Stadium]]]]</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> The Blue Devils have won seven <a>ACC Football Championships</a>, and have had three [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs come through the program (second in the ACC to only [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami's]] four).
In addition, the Blue Devils have produced 11 College Football Hall of Famers which is tied for the 2nd most in the ACC.
Duke has also won 18 total conference championships (7 ACC, 9 Southern Conference, and 1 Big Five Conference).
That total is the highest in the ACC.</pre>
<p>The most famous Duke <a>football</a> season came in 1938, when <a>Wallace Wade</a> coached the &quot;Iron Dukes&quot; that shut out all regular season opponents; only three teams in history can claim such a feat.
Duke reached their first <a>Rose Bowl</a> appearance, where they lost 7-3 when <a>USC</a> scored a <a>touchdown</a> in the final minute of the game.
Wade's Blue Devils lost another Rose Bowl to <a>Oregon State</a> in 1942, this one held at Duke's <a>home stadium</a> due to the <a>attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, which resulted in the fear that a large gathering on the West Coast might be in range of Japanese aircraft carriers.
The football program also proved successful in the 1950s and 1960s, winning six of the first ten <a>ACC football championships</a> from 1953 to 1962 under coach <a>Bill Murray</a>; the Blue Devils would not win the ACC championship again until 1989 under coach <a>Steve Spurrier</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its long history of success at football, Duke has not had a winning season since 1994.
<a>David Cutcliffe</a> was brought in two years ago as head coach, however, and he and his staff have been widely hailed as contributing to a turnaround that is currently in progress.
The 2009 team won 5 of 12 games and was eliminated from bowl contention in the next-to-last game of the season.
Typical of the external recognition given the team is the fact that Mike MacIntyre, the defensive coordinator, was named 2009 Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association </p>
<p>While the football team has struggled at times on the field, the graduation rate of its players is consistently among the highest among Division I-A schools.
Duke's high graduation rates have earned it more <a>American Football Coaches Association</a>'s Academic Achievement Awards than any other institution.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p> Duke alumni are active through organizations and events such as the annual Reunion Weekend and <a>Homecoming</a>.
There are 75 Duke clubs in the U.S. and 38 international clubs.
For the 2005&#x2013;06 fiscal year, Duke tied for third in alumni giving rate among U.S. colleges and universities.
