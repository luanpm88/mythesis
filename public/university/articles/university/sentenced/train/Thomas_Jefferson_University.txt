<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Jefferson Medical College</h3>
<p>[[File:Tivoli Theater Jefferson Medical College.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The

During the early 19th century, several attempts to create a second medical school in Philadelphia had been stymied, largely due to the efforts of <a>University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine</a> alumni  In an attempt to circumvent that opposition, a group of Philadelphia physicians led by Dr. <a>George McClellan</a> sent a letter to the trustees of Jefferson College in <a>Canonsburg, Pennsylvania</a> (now <a>Washington &amp; Jefferson College</a>) in 1824, asking the College to establish a medical department in Philadelphia.
The trustees agreed, establishing the Medical Department of Jefferson College in Philadelphia.
An additional 10 Jefferson College trustees were appointed to supervise the new facility from Philadelphia, owing to the difficulty of managing a medical department on the other side of the state.
Owing to the teaching philosophy of Dr. McClellan, classes focused on clinical practice.</p>
<p>By 1844 Jefferson was providing patient beds over a shop at 10th and Sansom Streets.
A 125-bed hospital, one of the first in the nation affiliated with a medical school, opened in 1877, and a school for nurses began in 1891.
The Medical College became Thomas Jefferson University on July 1, 1969.
As an academic health care center, Jefferson is currently involved in education, medical research, and patient care.</p>

The agreement brought together the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc. and Main Line Health under one corporate parent.
Since then, other established networks have joined Jefferson Health System as founding members, which at one point included the <a>Albert Einstein Healthcare Network</a>[<a>http://www.jeffersonhealth.org/news/archives.html</a>],
