<p>  <strong>Wellesley College</strong> is a private, highly selective <a>women's</a> <a>liberal-arts college</a> located in <a>Wellesley, Massachusetts</a>, <a>United States</a>.
Its  campus is located approximately  west of <a>Boston</a>.</p>
<p>Boston lawyer and lay preacher <a>Henry Fowle Durant</a> and his wife Pauline Fowle Durant founded the college in 1870 (enrollment began in 1875).
Wellesley is one of the original <a>Seven Sisters Colleges</a>.
After the destruction of the central College Hall in 1914, the college adopted a master plan developed by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.</a>, <a>Arthur Shurcliff</a>, and <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a> in 1921 and expanded into several new buildings.
The campus hosted a Naval Reserve Officer training program during the <a>second World War</a> and began to significantly revise its curriculum after the war and through the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Wellesley enrolls approximately 2,400 women in fifty-six baccalaureate degrees.
The college also offers research collaborations and cross-registration programs with other Boston-area institutions such as <a>Babson College</a>, <a>Olin College</a>, <a>MIT</a>, and <a>Brandeis University</a>.
Wellesley students have a number of traditions and also participate in 13 varsity sports in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a>'s <a>New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Campus of Wellesley College as it appeared circa 1880</a> Founded by Henry and Pauline Fowle Durant, the charter for Wellesley College was signed on March 17, 1870 by Massachusetts Governor <a>William Claflin</a>.
The original name of the College was the Wellesley Female Seminary, and the renaming to Wellesley College was approved by the <a>Massachusetts</a> legislature on March 7, 1873.
Opening day was September 8, 1875.</p>
<p>The first president of Wellesley was <a>Ada Howard</a>.
There have been twelve more presidents in its history: <a>Alice Elvira Freeman Palmer</a>, <a>Helen Almira Shafer</a>, Julia Josephine Thomas Irvine, Caroline Hazard, <a>Ellen Fitz Pendleton</a>, <a>Mildred H. McAfee</a> (later Mildred McAfee Horton), Margaret Clapp, Ruth M. Adams, Barbara Wayne Newell, <a>Nannerl Overholser Keohane</a> (later the president of <a>Duke University</a> from 1993&#x2013;2004), Diana Chapman Walsh and H. Kim Bottomly.</p>
<p>The original architecture of the College consisted of one very large building, College Hall, which was approximately 150 meters in length, and up to five stories in height.
The architect was <a>Hammatt Billings</a>.
From its completion in 1875 until 1914, it was both a principal academic building and a principal residential building.
On March 17, 1914 College Hall was destroyed by fire.
The precise cause of the fire was never officially established.
The fire was first noticed by students who lived on the fourth floor near the zoology laboratory.
It has been suggested that an electrical or chemical accident in this laboratory- specifically, an electrical incubator used in the breeding of beetles- triggered the fire.
A group of residence halls, known as the Tower Court complex, are located on top of the hill where the old College Hall once stood.
Wellesley is also home to Green Hall, the only building bearing the name of famed miser <a>Hetty Green</a>; Galen L. Stone Tower, in which a 32-bell <a>Carillon</a> is housed, is part of the building.</p>
<p>Like other women's colleges, Wellesley considered going co-ed in the late 1960's.
A combination of financial issues and student unrest led to the creation of a commission to decide the future of the college.
This committee voted to start admitting men.
However, Wellesley's board of trustees rejected this proposal, and the college remained a women's school.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|260px|Tower Court</a> The college is renowned for the picturesque beauty of its  campus which includes Lake Waban, evergreen and deciduous woodlands and open meadows.
<a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, Jr., Boston's preeminent landscape architect at the beginning of the 20th century, described Wellesley's landscape as &quot;not merely beautiful, but with a marked individual character not represented so far as I know on the ground of any other college in the country.&quot;
He also wrote: <em>I must admit that the exceedingly intricate and complex topography and the peculiarly scattered arrangement of most of the buildings somewhat baffled me.</em>
The original master plan for Wellesley's campus landscape was developed by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.</a>, <a>Arthur Shurcliff</a>, and <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a> in 1921.
This landscape-based concept represented a break from the architecturally-defined courtyard and quadrangle campus arrangement that was typical of American campuses at the time.
The  site's glaciated topography, a series of meadows, and native plant communities shaped the original layout of the campus, resulting in a campus architecture that is integrated into its landscape.
The most recent master plan for Wellesley College was completed in 1998 by <a>Michael Van Valkenburgh</a> Associates, Inc. (MVVA).
According to the designers, this plan was intended to restore and recapture the original landscape character of the campus that had been partially lost as the campus evolved through the 20th century.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>The current president of Wellesley College is H. Kim Bottomly.
The previous president was <a>Diana Chapman Walsh</a>, class of 1966.
As of June 30, 2008, the endowment for this college was about $1.63 billion.
Wellesley's last fund-raising campaign, in 2005, set a record for liberal arts colleges with a total of $472.3 million, 18.1% more than the goal of $400 million.

Wellesley has 30 academic departments, each offering a major, as well as 17 interdepartmental majors and an option for an individual major, designed by the student.</p>
<p>The college also has a special program for students over age 24, called Davis Scholars.
The program allows people who, for various reasons, were unable to start or complete a bachelor's degree at a younger age, to attend Wellesley.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|210px|Wellesley College Library</a> Wellesley College has a beautiful lake and path around the lake which is about  total.
In the beginning of their first year, the women throw pennies into Lake Waban.
As is the case with many colleges, especially the <a>Seven Sisters</a>, Wellesley College has many traditions, many of them carried over from the late 19th century.</p>
<p><a>Hoop rolling</a> is also a highly competitive annual tradition at the college dating back to 1895.
Each upperclasswoman has a wooden hoop, often passed down to her from her &quot;big sister&quot;.
Before graduation, the seniors, wearing their graduation robes, run a short race while rolling their hoops.
The winner of the race is said to be the first woman in her class to achieve success however she defines it, though this title has itself changed over the years (in early 20th century, it used to be the first woman to get married, later the first woman to become a CEO ).
She is also awarded flowers by the college president and tossed into Lake Waban.
The tossing of the winner into the lake began several decades ago when a <a>Harvard University</a> male, dressed as a Wellesley student, won the race.
When, upon his victory, it was discovered that he wasn&#x2019;t a Wellesley student, he was thrown into the lake.
The night before the race, many &quot;little sisters&quot; will camp out on the racecourse near the Library to save a good starting position for their &quot;big sisters&quot;.</p>
<p>Some other traditions include step-singing, dorm and class crew races, &quot;Lake Day&quot;, &quot;Spring Week&quot;, and &quot;Marathon Monday&quot;.
Each graduating class plants a tree during its sophomore year.
Class trees, as they are called, can be found all over the campus, marked with each class year on a stone at the base of the tree.
During sophomore year, students also design and purchase class sweatshirts.</p>
<p>Step-singing is one of the college's oldest traditions and occurs twice during the year.
Each graduation class has its own color (purple, red, green, or yellow).
Students dress in their class colors and they sing songs on the steps of the chapel.
In-between some of the songs, the classes shout cheers that make fun of the other classes.</p>
<p>Each fall, on a date that is not announced until the night before, students celebrate Lake Day.
The event consists of fun outdoor activities ranging from fried-dough stands to moonwalks and is deejayed by the college radio station, WZLY.
In the past, students skipped classes on Lake Day, but in recent years professors have objected to the practice and hold classes as planned.</p>
<p>One of the most popular traditions is the celebration of Marathon Monday which occurs on <a>Patriots Day</a> each spring, and is highlighted by the <a>Boston Marathon</a>.
The course of this marathon passes the college campus, which marks the race's halfway point.
Students line up along the street with posters and cheer for the runners.
Since they are so loud, the students have created what is widely known as the &quot;Wellesley Scream Tunnel&quot;.</p>
<p>Spring Week, held in April, is a week-long series of concerts sponsored by SBOG (Schneider Board of Governors).</p>
<p>Since 1970 three alumnae are honored at the Alumnae Achievement Awards every February for outstanding achievements in their respective fields.</p>
<p>Ruhlman and Tanner Conferences, supported by Wellesley alumnae, are held every year for students to share their learning experience within the college community.
Classes are usually canceled on these days.
Tanner Conference is held in the fall to celebrate outside-the-classroom education, including internships and summer or winter session research projects.
Ruhlman, in the spring, is a chance for students to present projects they&#x2019;ve been working on in courses or independent research during the year.
Both conferences encompass panels, readings, and multimedia projects.</p>
<p>Before finals, Wellesley has <a>midnight breakfast</a> every semester when students can take a break and eat late-night snacks with other fellow classmates that will be staying up late studying for exams.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Student body</h3>
<p>Fifty-six percent of all Wellesley students receive financial aid.
<a>In February 2008, the College eliminated offering financial-aid loans</a> to students from families with incomes under $60,000 (and for international students and Davis Scholars) and it lowered the total amount of student loans by one-third (to a maximum of $8,600 total over four years) to students from families with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000.
The maximum loan level for other students on aid is $12,825 total for four years.
Wellesley is one of few colleges or universities to meet 100% of a student's demonstrated financial need.</p>
