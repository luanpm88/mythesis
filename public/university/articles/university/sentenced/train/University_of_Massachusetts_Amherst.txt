<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Foundation and early years</h3>
<p><a>right|160px|The Centennial Seal of UMass Amherst</a> The university was founded in 1863 under the provisions of the <a>Federal Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a> to provide instruction to Massachusetts citizens in the &quot;agricultural, mechanical, and military arts.&quot;
Accordingly, the university was initially named the <strong>Massachusetts Agricultural College</strong>, popularly referred to as &quot;Mass Aggie&quot; or &quot;M.A.C.&quot;
In 1867, the college had yet to admit any students, had been through two Presidents, and still had not completed any college buildings.
In that year, <a>William S. Clark</a> was appointed President of the college and Professor of Botany.
He quickly appointed a faculty, completed the construction plan, and in the fall of 1867 admitted the first class of approximately 50 students.
Clark became the first functioning President and arguably the primary founding father of the college.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|Goodell Hall at UMass Amherst.</a>The
original buildings consisted of Old South College (a dormitory located on the site of the present South College), North College (a second dormitory once located just south of today's Machmer Hall), the Chemistry Laboratory, also known as College Hall (once located on the present site of Machmer Hall), the Boarding House (a small dining hall located just north of the present Campus Parking Garage), the Botanic Museum (located on the north side of the intersection of Stockbridge Road and Chancellor's Hill Drive) and the Durfee Plant House (located on the site of the new Durfee Conservatory).</p>
<p>Although enrollment was slow during the 1870s, the fledgling college built momentum under the leadership of President <a>Henry Hill Goodell</a>.
In the 1880s, Goodell implemented an expansion plan, adding the College Drill Hall in 1883 (the first gymnasium), the Old Chapel Library in 1885 (one of the oldest extant buildings on campus and an important symbol of the University), and the East and West Experiment Stations in 1886 and 1890.
The Campus Pond, now the central focus of the University Campus, was created in 1893 by damming a small brook.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|A picture looking north from the W.E.B. DuBois Library at UMass Amherst.
Lederle Graduate Research Tower can be seen in the background and the Campus Center and Hotel in the foreground.</a>The
early 20th century saw great expansion in terms of enrollment and the scope of the curriculum.
The first female student was admitted in 1875 on a part time basis and the first full time female student was admitted in 1894.
In 1903, Draper Hall was constructed for the dual purpose of a dining hall and female housing.
The first female students graduated with the class of 1905.
The first dedicated female dormitory, the Abigail Adams House (on the site of today Lederle Tower) was built in 1920.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century, the college was thriving and quickly expanded its curriculum to include liberal arts.
In recognition of the higher enrollment and broader curriculum, the college was renamed <strong>Massachusetts State College</strong> in 1931.</p>
<p>Following World War II, the <a>G.I.
Bill</a>, facilitating financial aid for veterans, led to an explosion of applicants.
The college population soared and Presidents <a>Hugh Potter Baker</a> and <a>Ralph Van Meter</a> labored to push through major construction projects in the 1940s and 50s, particularly with regard to dormitories (now Northeast and Central Residential Areas).
Accordingly, the name of the college was changed in 1947 to the &quot;University of Massachusetts.&quot;</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the University continued to grow and gave rise to a shuttle bus service on campus as well as many other architectural additions; this included the <a>Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center</a> complete with a hotel, office space, fine dining restaurant, campus store, and passage way to the parking garage, the <a>W.
E. B. Du Bois Library</a>, and the Fine Arts Center.
</p>
<p>Over the course of the next two decades, the <a>John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center</a> and the Conte National Polymer Research Center were built and UMass Amherst emerged as a major research facility.
The Robsham Memorial Center for Visitors welcomed thousands of guests to campus after its dedication in 1989.
For athletic and other large events, the <a>Mullins Center</a> was opened in 1993, hosting capacity crowds as the Minutemen basketball team was ranked #1 for many weeks in the mid 1990s, and reached the <a>Final Four</a> in 1996.</p>
<p>UMass Amherst entered the 21st century as the flagship campus of the state&#x2019;s five-campus University system, has close to 24,000 students enrolled, and gained a national as well as international reputation for excellence.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The school has several buildings (constructed in the 1960s and 70s) of importance in the modernist style, including the Lincoln Campus Center and Hotel designed by <a>Marcel Breuer</a>, the Southwest Residential Area designed by <a>Hugh Stubbins Jr</a> of <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>, The <a>Fine Arts Center</a> by <a>Kevin Roche</a>, the W.E.B. DuBois Library by <a>Edward Durell Stone</a>, and Alumni Stadium by <a>Gordon Bunshaft</a>.
While many of the older dorms and lecture halls are built in a <a>Georgian Revival</a> style such as <a>French Hall</a>, <a>Fernald Hall</a> and <a>Flint Laboratory</a>.
i The eclectic mix of building styles draws mixed reactions from students and visitors.</p>
<p>Newly completed construction projects on campus include the Studio Arts Building, the Campus Recreation Center and the Integrated Science Building.
There are projects on campus currently under construction which include: a new Campus Police Station, the Minuteman Marching Band Building, a Bowditch Greenhouse, a Southwest Concourse and a Laboratory Sciences Building.</p>
<h3>Designation as flagship campus</h3>
<p>In 2003, for the first time, UMass Amherst was legally designated by the state legislature as a research university and the &quot;flagship campus of the UMass system.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>There are 972 permanent faculty, 20,000 undergraduates.
In 2010 the state budgeted $465 million for the UMass system.
State funding is 25% of revenue.&lt;!--I omitted the comparisons with 2000 which should probably be in a history section--&gt;&lt;!--selection of soft copy arbitrary.
Could not match hard copy though contents are the same---&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Buildings and layout</h3>
<p>The campus extends about  from the Campus Center in all directions.
The university owns significant amounts of land in the nearby towns of <a>Sunderland</a> and <a>Hadley</a>.</p>
<p>The campus may be thought of as a series of concentric rings.
In the outermost ring are parking lots, the admissions center, playing fields and barns for the animal science program.
In the middle ring there are the six residential areas and dining commons.
(There are four dinning commons on campus, Franklin, Worcester, Berkshire and Hampshire.
Though Berkshire was most recently renovated and is considered the premier dining hall, Worcester sees the highest volume of diners.)
The innermost ring has most of the classroom buildings and research labs.</p>
<h4>South Campus</h4>
<p>[[File:Umass Amherst Chapel &amp; Library in the evening.jpg|thumb|225px|left|The
center of the UMass Amherst campus.
To the left is the Old Chapel, and to the right the [[W.
E. B. Du Bois Library]]]] The <a>Isenberg School of Management</a> has its buildings in the southernmost part of campus near the Visitors Center and the <a>Newman Center, the Catholic student center</a>.
In addition to being the site of the main administration building, Whitmore, the southeast side of campus has buildings mainly dedicated to the humanities and fine arts.
Buildings include Herter, Bartlett, Mahar and the Fine Arts Center (FAC).
Between Whitmore, the FAC and Isenberg lies the Haigis Mall, a local stop on both the <a>PVTA</a> and <a>Peter Pan bus</a> lines.
The buildings on the southwest side of campus house the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.
These include Dickinson Hall and Tobin Hall.</p>
<h5>Student Union</h5>
<p>The Student Union Building houses most of the University's registered student organizations (RSOs) and is the home of the Student Government Association.
Other facilities include a convenience store, a ball room, and a student lounge.
Several student-run businesses and co-ops are also present in the building including: Campus Design and Copy (CD&amp;C), Tickets Unlimited, Bike Coop, People's Market (a <a>Fair trade</a> convenience store/bagel shop),  and a vegan/vegetarian eatery called Earthfoods Cafe.
The Student Union also includes a stairwell and a connecting passageway to walk through to the Campus Center.
Many students can be found walking through the buildings rather than outside to get around campus as well as doing homework in the lounge chairs provided.</p>
<h5>South College</h5>
<p>The linguistics department is located at the South College.
The DuBois library was intended to be an annex to South College.</p>
<p>;Campus Center Designed by famed architect <a>Marcel Breuer</a>, the Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center is located adjacent to the Student Union and is accessible via passageways from both the Student Union as well as from the main level of the parking garage.</p>
<p>On the concourse level are the campus store, restrooms, graduate student lounge, which serves beer, and the Bluewall, which contains a cafe, a smoothie stand and a fair trade coffee stand.
This level is a high-traffic area throughout most of the day with students and faculty not only using it as a 'pass through' from one building to another, but also as the central hub of on-campus life.
Many people often pass the time between classes on this level and it is common to find vendors and organizations operating from fold-out tables along either side.</p>
<p>The lower level of the campus center has multiple conference rooms and a large auditorium.
Within the central space of the lower level are telephones, ATMs, vending, as well as couches and television.
The offices of the University newspaper, The Daily Collegian, can be found at the far end of the level, along with the University radio station, <a>WMUA</a>, and its offices.
One of the basement rooms is home to the UMass Science Fiction Society's library which is the second largest Science Fiction library on the east coast.</p>
<p>The top floor of the Campus Center, &quot;The Top of the Campus&quot; recently underwent a complete renovation.
It is home to a state of the art teaching kitchen, beverage lab and dining room facility.</p>
<p>;Campus Center Hotel Above the concourse level is the Campus Center Hotel, a five-level full service facility with 116 rooms, including four suites located in the Campus Center.
The Campus Center Hotel is the training ground for the university's Hospitality and Tourism Management students.
The Campus Center Hotel was completely renovated and refurnished in 2009 and was renamed &quot;The UMASS Hotel at the Campus Center.&quot;</p>
<p>;Fletcher's Cafe Fletcher's Caf&#x00e9; is a student-run business on campus at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.
It is located in Flint Lab, the Hospitality and Tourism Management building, which is next to the campus center parking garage.
Students that are part of the Hospitality and Tourism Management major take on full managerial responsibilities and are required to hire employees, order food and drinks, take care of accounting and hopefully make a profit by the end of the semester.
Fletcher's Cafe is currently run by Jamie Tooley and Dan Shaw.</p>
<h4>North Campus</h4>
<p>The north side of campus is mostly dedicated to science and engineering, and many buildings there are newer than their counterparts in the humanities.
The Physics Department primarily uses Hasbrouck Lab, located at 666 North Pleasant Street.
The Lederle Graduate Research Tower is the largest building on the north side, housing the Math department on its sixteenth floor.
As the Math Department headquarters, the sixteenth floor is prominently labeled 4&#x00b2;.
The <a>Silvio Conte</a> Polymer Research facility is located in North campus.</p>
<h5>Computer science</h5>
<p>The Computer Science department recently moved into an airy new building built for them on the edge of campus, though classes are often taught elsewhere, especially for lower division classes.
Between the imposing concrete LGRT, the second-story walkway from it to its sister structure the LGRC, the glass-and-aluminum Computer Science building, and other new buildings for the Engineering and Polymer Science departments, North Campus looks more &quot;high-tech&quot; than the rest of campus.</p>
<h3>Sports, recreation, and exercise</h3>
<p>[[File:Stadium2-3.jpg|link=<a>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stadium2-3.jpg</a>|thumb|right|300px|Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium.]]
Major sporting events, such as UMass's hockey and basketball team games, are held in the <a>Mullins Center</a>, amidst the fields to the west.
Other locales for sporting events include <a>Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium</a> (where UMass holds its football games) and Garber Field, which is an artificial-turf field adjacent to Boyden Gym used for lacrosse, field hockey, and various team practices.</p>
<p>In fall 2007, ground was broken across the street from the Mullins Center on a new $50 million recreation complex.
The Recreation Center was completed in spring 2009 and spans three floors, including weight and cardio equipment, a basketball court and jogging/running track, activity rooms, locker facilities, and a juice bar.
The Rec Center is free for undergraduates, and available for a fee to graduate students and faculty/staff.
The building was originally scheduled to open in early September, but was delayed due to problems with fire safety and security systems.
The Rec Center opened to the public on December 3, 2009.</p>
<p>On campus there are two other gyms: Totman (adjacent to the North Apartments) and Boyden (near the Southwest residential area).
Prior to 2009, both gyms held fitness centers which have been replaced by the Rec Center.
Both buildings also hold basketball courts (although the Totman court has remained closed in the fall 2009 semester), locker room facilities, and pools.
Both buildings also hold classrooms and offices; Totman in particular is home to the kinesiology department and has a student-run Body Shop.
There are four small in-dorm gyms that are available for a fee as part of the Wellness program; in Lewis (in Northeast), John Quincy Adams and Washington towers (in Southwest), and Webster (in Orchard Hill).
To the west of campus are numerous fields used for recreation and intramural sports.
There is also a set of tennis courts located north of Boyden.</p>
<p>The baseball team plays its home games at <a>Earl Lorden Field</a>, adjacent to the Mullins Center practice rink.
Down the street, near Southwest, is the UMass Softball Complex as well as Rudd Field, home of the UMass men's and women's soccer teams.</p>
<p>In addition to Totman and Boyden, there is <a>Curry Hicks Cage</a>, which hosts a small indoor track, pool, and basketball court.
It is also occasionally used as a venue for guest speakers (such as the fall 2006 visit from comedian <a>Bob Saget</a>) and for the Western Mass high school basketball championships and other similar sporting events.
The Cage was the home of the UMass men's and women's basketball teams before the Mullins Center was built.</p>
<h3>Campus bus system</h3>
<p><a>UMass and the PVTA, employing student workers, provide campus bus service throughout both the UMass Amherst campuses and the northern region of the PVTA service area.|thumb|left|200px</a>
The campus bus system was established in 1969 as the Student Senate Transit Services (now UMass Transit).
In 1973, a demonstration grant secured money to set up a fare-free transit system.
This, coupled with increased parking fees and strict parking regulations, was used to alleviate vehicular congestion and parking problems on campus.
In 1976, the University of Massachusetts Transit Services became a contractor for <a>PVTA</a>.
UMass Transit (or UMTS) introduced an honor-based system in which any potential rider (not including students with valid UCards) during certain reduced service periods times of the year (or PVTA employees at any time of year) will be expected to have in his or her possession a ticket purchased locally in Amherst that grants either single or multiple rides, or a days or weeks pass purchased in Amherst or from a Springfield or Northampton bus.
UMass Transit, or UMTS, is a contractor for the PVTA, and runs its Amherst based routes from a garage based on campus.
It serves not only the University of Massachusetts campus, but also the surrounding colleges and communities.
This bus system is run primarily by University students and is free for students, which allows them to easily get to classes at the other four colleges.</p>
<h3>Residential areas</h3>
<p> At UMass Amherst, only Freshman are required to live on campus.
Housing is open to all full-time undergraduate students, regardless of year.
Upper-class students who have continuously lived on campus during their first and sophomore years are guaranteed housing as long as they choose to live on campus.
If, however, a student is admitted after their sophomore year, or moves off campus, and wants to move back onto campus, they are not guaranteed housing, but instead must go through a housing lottery, since demand outstrips supply.
Housing assignments are accomplished by a <a>complex process</a> that takes into account building seniority as well as class year; those choosing to move from their building are subject to a lottery system.
There are approximately 12,000 students living on-campus.</p>
<h4><a>North Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>The newest residence halls on campus opened in the Fall of 2006.
Located between Sylvan and Northeast, these apartment-style dormitories house approximately 850 undergraduates in four buildings.
They boast a living area, a kitchen, two bathrooms and four individual bedrooms, and central air conditioning.
The point of the design was to simulate &quot;apartment style living&quot;.
They are the most expensive residence halls on campus.</p>
<h4><a>Sylvan Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>Sylvan is adjacent to the North Residential Area, and before the opening of North, was the newest residential area on campus, construction having been completed in the early 1970s.
Sylvan contains three, eight-story towers: McNamara, Brown, and Cashin.
It is morbidly nicknamed &quot;Suicide Sylvan&quot; by the students due to its isolated location from other dorms and because it is thought to be less social than other residence areas, making it an unpopular living area for students.
Sylvan is distinctive for offering suite-style living in a shady wooded area.
Sylvan derives from Latin silva, &quot;a wood or grove.&quot;
Each residence hall contains 64 suites and each suite is either unisex or co-ed.
Sylvan Snack Bar is a student run dining option in the McNamara dorm.
Founded in 1971 the snack bar serves a variety of foods and delivers to the Sylvan and North areas of campus.</p>
<h4><a>Northeast Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>Northeast, is across the street from North and diagonal to Sylvan.
The residential area consists of nine buildings assembled in a rectangle surrounding a grassy quad.
Northeast is one of the oldest residential areas on campus and has what one might call classic academic architecture, consisting of red brick buildings and gabled/shingled roofs.</p>
<p>Northeast is also home to Worcester Dining Common, which contains a separate dining room called the Oak Room, primarily offering Asian-style food during the lunch and dinner hours.
Worcester's basement is also home to a large, grocery-style convenience store as well as one of the four Pita Pit locations on campus.</p>
<h4><a>Central Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>Central is unique because it has three academic buildings in addition to nine residence halls located along a hill on the east side of campus.</p>
<p>University Health Services is located next to Brett and Brooks halls, on Infirmary Way.
Central is serviced by Franklin Dining Common, across the street from Brett and Wheeler.
Franklin contains kosher and vegan dining options as well as a convenience store.
Greeno Sub Shop is also an option for students living in the Central area.
Located in the basement of the Greenough dorm, Greeno is a student run business that offers sandwiches and other snacks to students.</p>
<h4><a>Orchard Hill Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>Completed in 1964, the Orchard Hill residence area is located in an old apple orchard which still blooms every spring.
It is located to the north of the Central residential area, and to the east of the main academic campus.
Orchard Hill is composed of four residence halls: Dickinson, Webster, Grayson and Field.
Orchard Hill is also home to Sweets and More, a student run business that offers baked goods, ice cream, and small snacks.
It is located in the Field Lounge.
</p>
<p>The Orchard Hill Area Government, which is run by elected students, is headquartered in Field 112.</p>
<h4><a>Southwest Residential Area</a></h4>
<p>Southwest is the largest residential area on the UMass campus, housing 5,500 students.
There are 11 low-rise dormitories and 5 high-rise consisting of 22 stories each.
It was built in the 1960s, and all the buildings are built in the modern style.
The 5 high-rise dormitories are named after the four <a>U.S. Presidents</a> from the state of <a>Massachusetts</a> (<a>John Adams</a>, <a>John Quincy Adams</a>, <a>Calvin Coolidge</a>, and <a>John Kennedy</a>), and <a>George Washington</a>.</p>
<h3>Parking on-campus</h3>
<p>Parking at UMass is open to all students via Parking Services for a fee.
Cost varies depending on seniority and location.
The most typical student parking permits range from $60 to $300 for the year.
It is a color coded system with Green, Purple and Yellow Lots available to students.
Purple Lots are typically closest to the dorm/housing areas; Yellow Lots are the cheapest but the farthest away; Green lots are for commuter students.
Parking is also available in the campus garage for a fee of $1.50 per hour during the day.
In the evening there is a night rate of $3.00.
Payment options include cash or ucard.
Meter parking is also available at select locations through out campus.
The meters accept nickels, dimes, and quarters only.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<h3>Environmental Research</h3>
<p>UMass Amherst researchers have positioned the campus as a national leader in <a>sustainability</a>.
</p>
<p>Economics professor <a>Robert Pollin</a> has influenced the national discussion about how best to stimulate the U.S. economy and promote sustainability.
He and colleagues at the Political Economy Research Institute have developed a plan for national recovery that shows, for example, that investing in clean energy (wind power, solar, and biofuels) will create about three times as many good-paying jobs than conventional projects will, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil.
</p>
<p>Since September 2009, the campus has won more than $36 million in competitive stimulus grants.
These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$7.1 million in grants from the National Science Foundation to approximately 20 separate researchers.</li>
<li>$16 million from the Department of Energy to establish an Energy Frontier Research Center on campus to develop highly efficient non-silicon polymer materials for harvesting solar energy.</li>
<li>$1.9 million to chemical engineer George Huber to further develop bio-fuels from inedible corn stalks, bark, wood waste, and similar biomass.</li>
</ul>
<pre></pre>
<p>Other significant research in environmentally-safe technology among UMass Amherst faculty includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microbiologist Susan Leschine has raised $25 million to commercialize technology that converts plant waste into ethanol using the Q microbe, discovered in the Quabbin Reservoir just east of the campus.</li>
<li>James Manwell, director of the Renewable Energy Research Laboratory, leads testing on large wind-turbine blades at a new federal facility in Boston after helping construct two municipal wind turbines in Hull, Massachusetts.</li>
</ul>
<pre></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Microbiologist Derek Lovley discovered <a>Geobacter</a>, a tiny biological structure that can clean up groundwater and produce electricity through conductive microbial nanowires.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sustainability on Campus</h3>
<p>The campus adopted (OS1) &#x2014; cleaning program that stresses environmental health and specific standards &#x2014; 15 years ago.</p>
<p>The award-winning Central Heating Plant, opened in 2009, is one of the cleanest-burning plants in the nation.
It reduces greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 75 percent from the previous coal-burning plant that dated back to 1918.</p>
<p>Across campus, other conservation measures have cut campus greenhouse gas emissions by 24 percent since 2004.</p>
<p>Sustainability Studies is offered through the <a>University Without Walls</a>, the university's adult bachelor's degree completion program.</p>

<h3>Student Government Association</h3>
<p>The Student Government Association (SGA) is the undergraduate student governmental body, and provides funding for the many registered student organizations (RSOs) and agencies, including the Student Legal Services Office (SLSO) and the Student Center for Educational Research and Advocacy (SCERA).
The SGA also makes formal recommendations on matters of Administration policy and advocates for undergraduate students to the Administration, non-student organizations, and local and state government.
The SGA has a budget of approximately 2 million dollars per year which is collected for students in the form of the Student Activities Fee.
The student activities fee is currently $47 per semester (Spring 2009).
It is used to fund RSOs, Agencies and the SGA itself.</p>
<p>The SGA has three branches: the President and Executive Cabinet, the Undergraduate Student Senate, and the Student Judiciary.</p>
<p><strong>Area governments</strong> There are a total of seven area governments.
Each of the campus's six residential areas has an area government, and there is also a Commuter Area Government to serve commuter students.
Area governments provide social programming for their areas, and are in charge of the house councils for the dorms in their area.
They also represent the needs and interests of students in their areas to the Administration, Housing and Residence Life and the SGA.</p>
<p>Area Governments have a tradition of sponsoring large events, generally in the Spring, such as Fill the Hill, Bowl Weekend and Southwest Week.</p>
<p><strong>House councils</strong> Each residence hall or residential &quot;cluster&quot; (a group of residence halls) at UMass Amherst has a house council.
House councils report to their respective area governments.

House councils also engage in social programming for their halls or clusters, and advocate to housing staff in regards to concerns of students in their hall/cluster.</p>
<h3>Registered student organizations</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|UMass Amherst looking southeast from the air.</a>UMass
Amherst has many registered student organizations (RSOs).
Most RSOs are funded by the Student Government Association (SGA), from the activity fee that all students pay, however, the SGA has often been criticized for not funding all clubs fully or equally.
In recent years, the fee has been about $81.
In order to start an RSO, one needs a group of at least eight interested students, who then petition the SGA for recognition.
Each semester, the SGA reviews RSOs, and those which have too few members are considered inactive.
Club Sports, which are non-NCAA athletic or organized sports teams, are considered RSOs.</p>
<h3>Residential Leadership Association</h3>
<p>The Residential Leadership Association is a student organization composed of residential students.
It is composed of an executive board and hall level leaders known as Community Leaders (CLs).
RLA is nationally affiliated with the National Association of College and University Residence Halls (NACURH).
This organization makes an effort to support all the residential students UMass Amherst by providing programming and leadership development opportunities.
It provides various leadership opportunities such as leadership conferences and roundtable discussions while continuing to foster the development of the on campus community through innovative programming.
In the past, such programs such as Johnny Cupcakes, a Ski Trip, a BBQ/Concert have been put on by RLA.</p>
<p>Founded in 2003, RLA strives to make a positive impact on this campus.
RLA is the parent/sister group to the National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) which recognizes student leaders within the residence halls.
The RLA office is located in the basement of Pierpont Hall in the Southwest Residential Area.</p>

<p>UMass Amherst scientists Richard Farris, Todd Emrick, and Bryan Coughlin lead the research team that has developed a synthetic polymer that doesn't burn.
This polymer is a building block of plastic, and the new flame-retardant plastics won't need to have flame-retarding chemicals added to their composition.
These chemicals have recently been found in many different areas from homes and offices to fish, and there are environmental and health concerns regarding the additives.
The newly developed polymers would not require the addition of these potentially hazardous chemicals.
Coughlin, one of the research team leaders, notes that this is &quot;really a two-birds-with-one-stone approach for a new polymer.
It is extremely fire-safe and does not contain halogenated additives, which are known to be environmentally hazardous.&quot;</p>
<h3>Campus activism</h3>
<p>UMass Amherst has a history of protest and activism among the undergraduate and graduate population.
It has been the site of many sit-ins, and protests, often led by the Radical Student Union and its successor movements, Take Back UMass, among others.
Students at UMass have received press for their <a>activism</a>, including numerous rallies against the <a>Vietnam War</a>, <a>South African Apartheid</a>, the <a>Persian Gulf War</a>, the <a>WTO</a>, and the <a>Iraq War</a>, along with a large vigil for the victims of the <a>September 11th Attacks</a>.
There have also been numerous protests regarding campus-related issues, including opposition to the ending of affirmative action at UMass in 2000, to the imposition of a <a>Student and Exchange Visitor Information System Fee</a> in 2003-2004, and protesting tuition and fee hikes in 2007 that make the university the second most expensive for in-state students (behind the <a>University of Vermont</a>).</p>
