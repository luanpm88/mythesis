<p>The <strong>University of Illinois</strong> is a system of public <a>universities</a> in <a>Illinois</a> consisting of three campuses: <a>Urbana-Champaign</a>, <a>Chicago</a>, and <a>Springfield</a>.
Across its three campuses, the University of Illinois enrolls about 70,000 students.
It had an operating budget of $4.17 billion in 2007.
The university changed its name to University of Illinois in 1885, and then again to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1982.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is the largest and most prestigious of the three campuses.
UIUC, or more commonly U of I, is the flagship state university campus.
It is home to 16 colleges and instructional units including the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences; College of Applied Health Sciences; Institute of Aviation; College of Business; College of Education; College of Engineering; College of Fine and Applied Arts; Graduate College; Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations; College of Law; College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; Graduate School of Library and Information Science; College of Media; College of Medicine (a branch of the medical school); School of Social Work; and the College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<p>It is also home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, <a>NCSA</a>, where <a>Marc Andreessen</a> (of <a>Netscape</a> fame) and others helped develop the <a>Mosaic</a> web browser, the first <a>HTML</a> browser capable of rendering images.
In addition, in <a>1987</a>, NCSA created <a>NCSA Telnet</a>, a program which permitted users access to the supercomputer's resources remotely.
Also, in the movie <em><a>2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>, the ship's computer, HAL, states that it was built in Urbana.</p>
<p><a>UIUC</a> is also famous for its contributions in electrical engineering, and is the birth place of world's first <a>light-emitting diode</a> (LED).
It is generally considered that a UIUC professor or alumnus will, on average, win a <a>Nobel</a> or <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> at least every three years, which speaks to the quality of the scientific research and literary standards of the institution.
The library is notable both for being the largest public academic library in the country, with over forty departmental libraries, and for possessing eleven million volumes.
Each year, the library circulates about 1.2 million items and answers about 293,000 reference questions.
The University is highly ranked in engineering, law, library and information science, chemistry, computer science, labor and industrial relations, educational psychology, finance, accounting, business administration, communication, and music.
Physics professor <a>John Bardeen</a> won the <a>Nobel Physics Prize</a> <a>twice</a> in his lifetime, an honor no other researcher has received.
The school's marching band, named the <a>Marching Illini</a>, also enjoys a superb reputation.
Until recently, the symbol of the University's <a>athletic teams</a> was a Native American figure, <a>Chief Illiniwek</a>, which had sparked significant controversy.
Chief Illiniwek completed his last performance on February 21, 2007 and has since been retired from performing and as the official symbol of the school.</p>
<p>Currently the campus boasts the world's most technologically advanced Computer Science building, Siebel Center, as well as many other world-class research laboratories such as Loomis Laboratory of Physics.</p>
<h3>Chicago</h3>

The largest university in the <a>Chicago</a> area, UIC serves approximately 25,000 students within 15 colleges &amp; schools including Applied Health Sciences, Architecture and the Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Graduate, Honors, Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, Social Work, Urban Planning &amp; Public Affairs, and the College of Medicine (largest branch of four branches of the medical school) which is the nation's largest medical school.
With annual research expenditures exceeding $290 million, UIC is one of five doctoral research universities in the State of Illinois.
Playing a critical role in Illinois healthcare, UIC operates the state&#x2019;s major public medical center and serves as the principal educator of Illinois&#x2019; physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The modern UIC was formed in <a>1982</a> by the consolidation of two U. of I. campuses: the Medical Center campus, which dates back to the nineteenth century; and the comprehensive Chicago Circle campus, which in 1965 replaced the two-year undergraduate <a>Navy Pier</a> campus designated to educate returning veterans.
This consolidation and expansion is why &quot;UIC&quot; is the preferred shortened name today.</p>
<p>UIC&#x2019;s student body is recognized as the nation&#x2019;s fourth most diverse, and it reflects the global character of Chicago.</p>
<h3>Springfield</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The smallest campus is <a>University of Illinois at Springfield</a>, formerly Sangamon State University from <a>1969</a> until June 30, 1995.
It is the smallest in the Illinois system with the lowest student/teacher ratio of all three campuses, and is located in <a>Springfield, Illinois</a>, the state <a>capital</a> of <a>Illinois</a>.
The University of Illinois system transitioned Sangamon State University from an upper division university into a full four-year institution with an undergraduate program, and now enrolls approximately 275 freshmen, including 125 honors students each year to the Capital Scholars Honors Program.</p>
<p>UIS serves almost 5,000 students in 20 master's degree, 20 undergraduate programs, and a Doctorate in Public Administration.
The academic curriculum of the campus emphasizes a strong liberal arts core, an array of professional programs, extensive opportunities in experiential education, and a broad engagement in public affairs issues in its academic and community service pursuits.</p>
<p>The 2008-2009 sports seasons will be the last for UIS as a member of the NAIA.
UIS is becoming an NCAA Division II.
The institution received a formal invitation to join the <a>GLVC</a> athletic conference starting in the fall of 2009, provided it has installed a baseball program by 2010 or it will lose its membership.</p>
<p>As a Master's University, UIS is a Tier 1 university according to U.S. News and World Report.
It is ranked as the 4th best public university in the Midwest.
Furthermore, UIS students graduate with the 3rd least debt load of all universities in the Midwest category.</p>
<h3>Global Campus</h3>
<p> In January 2008, the University of Illinois launched The Global Campus, the University's newest initiative in <a>online education</a>.
The University <a>Board of Trustees</a> established The Global Campus in March 2007 to further the land-grant mission to expand educational opportunities for the <a>Illinois</a> community and beyond with <a>distance education</a> technologies.
The University of Illinois Global Campus primarily serves non-traditional and place-bound students, in order that they may gain the academic and career benefits of a University of Illinois education without the barriers of location and scheduled class times.</p>
<p>In May 2009, the Board of Trustees voted to phase out the Global Campus Initiative.
The University of Illinois transitioned the programs developed by the Global Campus to academic units on the corresponding residential campuses.</p>
<h2>Foundation</h2>
<p>The University of Illinois foundation is the official fundraising and gift agency of the University of Illinois system.
Currently, The University aims to raise $2.25 billion for students, faculty, research and the campus environment through the &#x201c;Brilliant Futures&#x201d; fundraising campaign.
The program is dubbed as &quot;the largest and most ambitious campaign in the history of the University of Illinois&quot;.</p>

<p>Inclusive of all graduates, current and former students of the University of Illinois, the University of Illinois Alumni Association has the largest alumni membership in the world with more than 600,000 members internationally.
The UIAA has offices at each UI campus in Urbana-Champaign, Springfield and Chicago, as well as the Alumni Career Center in Chicago&#x2019;s Loop, which offers comprehensive career services to all UI alumni.
In addition to hosting events, awards programs, and regional and special-interest alumni groups, the UIAA publishes a variety of communications vehicles to inform and connect alumni with the University and each other.
It also coordinates the Illinois Connection legislative advocacy network and the EXPLORERS alumni travel program.
