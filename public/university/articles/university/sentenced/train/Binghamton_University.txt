<p></p>
<p><strong>State University of New York at Binghamton</strong>, also called <strong>Binghamton University</strong> , is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> located in the <a>state</a> of <a>New York</a>.
The school's main campus is located in <a>Vestal, New York</a>, with a secondary education center located in nearby downtown <a>Binghamton, New York</a>.
The university is one of the four university centers in New York State's <a>State University of New York</a> system of post-secondary public education centers.
Since its establishment in 1946, the university has grown from a small liberal arts college to a large doctoral-granting institution, presently consisting of six colleges and schools and is now home to nearly 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
The Carnegie Foundation has classified the university as RU/H (university with high research activity).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Binghamton University was established in 1946 as <strong>Triple Cities College</strong> to serve the needs of local veterans returning from <a>World War II</a> of the <a>Triple Cities</a> area.
Established in <a>Endicott, New York</a>; the college was a branch of <a>Syracuse University</a>.
Originally, Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years of their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse.
However, starting in the 1946-47 year, students were allowed to earn their degrees entirely in Binghamton.
When the college split from Syracuse and became incorporated into the <a>State University of New York</a> (SUNY) in 1950, it was renamed <strong>Harpur College</strong>, in honor of <a>Robert Harpur</a>, a Colonial teacher and pioneer who settled in the Binghamton area.
It was one of only two public liberal arts schools in New York state.
Of the four University Centers (<a>Stony Brook</a>, <a>Albany</a>, <a>Buffalo</a> and Binghamton), Binghamton was the first to join SUNY.</p>
<p>In 1951, the college began a move to its current location in <a>Vestal, New York</a>.
The  site was purchased from a local farmer, anticipating future growth for the school.
Colonial Hall, the original building of the former campus, stands today as the <a>Village of Endicott</a> Visitor's Center.

<p>After Harpur was selected as one of the four university centers of <a>SUNY</a> in 1965, it was renamed <strong>State University of New York at Binghamton</strong>.
As other schools were added to the university, Harpur College retained its name and its status as the largest of Binghamton's constituent schools -- Harpur College of Arts and Sciences, with more than 60 percent of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in its degree programs.</p>
<p>The first president of Harpur College, who began as dean of Triple Cities College, was Glenn Bartle.
The second president, g. Bruce Dearing, served several years during the Vietnam era, and then left to become vice chancellor for academic affairs at the SUNY Central Administration in Albany.
Third in line was C. Peter Magrath, who came from the University of Nebraska, served from 1972-1974, then left in the summer of 1974 to become president at the University of Minnesota.
</p>
<p>The fourth president at Binghamton was Clifford D. Clark, who left his position as dean of the Business school at the University of Kansas to serve as vice president for academic affairs at Binghamton in 1973, but quickly was asked to take on the job of acting president in the fall of 1974 when Magrath left for Minnesota.
Clark then was selected as president and served from March 1975 through mid-1990.
In Clark's presidency, he led the campus as it moved from primarily a stellar four-year liberal arts college to a thriving research university.
Clark added the Anderson Center for the Performing Arts and inaugurated the Summer Music Festival, created the Harpur Forum (now called the Binghamton University Forum), established the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science, fostered the expansion and development of the Decker School of Nursing, turned a simple public information office into a development, alumni and public relations office able to represent the University to its many constituencies, and, during a short leave from Binghamton when he served as vice chancellor for graduate studies and research at SUNY Central, pushed for and got a new program for underrepresented graduate students, which continues today to bring diverse students of exceptional caliber to SUNY.
The program at Binghamton is enhanced through the Clark Fellowship program, which provides supplemental funding to support these students' endeavors.
Upon his retirement from the presidency, Clark taught for several years at Binghamton as University Professor in the Economics Department and on taking emeritus status has continued to teach one course a year in development economics in his home in southeast Michigan.
Lois B. DeFleur became the University's fifth president upon Clark's retirement in 1990.
DeFleur retired in 2010 and on July 1, C. Peter Magrath returned as president on an interim basis.</p>
<p>Although the University's name officially remains State University of New York at Binghamton, since 1992, it has called itself Binghamton University, its popularly used, short-form name.</p>
<h3>Thomas J. Watson</h3>
<p><a>Thomas J. Watson</a> is an important figure in Binghamton's fabric.
Having been a founding member of <a>IBM</a> in <a>Broome County</a>, Watson viewed the region as an area of great potential.
In the early 1940s he collaborated with a group of local leaders to initiate the creation of Triple Cities College (of <a>Syracuse University</a>), which would later become Harpur College and then finally Binghamton.
He donated land at and around the original IBM site in <a>Endicott, New York</a>, where the school called home for just a few years.
The campus broke ground at its current location in <a>Vestal, New York</a>, in 1954.
In 1967, the School of Advanced Technology was established&#x2014;the precursor to the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science that was founded in 1983.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Binghamton's New Downtown Campus in July 2007</a> <a>thumb|right|The Couper Administration Building</a></p>
<p>Binghamton has grown to include roughly 120 buildings, including recent additions from a $2.2 billion SUNY capital plan.
New facilities include a housing complex; academic facilities; an indoor multipurpose Events Center to accommodate the University's commencement exercises, Bearcat athletic events and other activities; an addition to the University Union and the partially completed Innovative Technologies Complex (ITC).
Another significant addition is the $29 million University Downtown Center in downtown Binghamton, which opened in fall 2007 and houses the College of Community and Public Affairs.
Most recently, the 2007 soccer season saw the debut of a new outdoor soccer and lacrosse stadium, construction on a $66-million engineering and science building at the ITC is well underway and the University has broken ground for its Center of Excellence building, also at the ITC.
</p>
<p>A unique feature of the main campus is that it is shaped like a brain.
The primary road on campus creates a closed loop to form the <a>cerebrum</a> and <a>cerebellum</a>, and the main entrance road creates the spinal cord which leads up to a traffic circle (representing the <a>medulla</a>).
The main road is thus frequently referred to as <em>The Brain</em>.
The connector road, which goes behind the Mountainview and College-in-the-Woods residential communities, is closed for a portion of the year (from late fall to spring).
The campus is spread over 930 acres (3.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) just south of the <a>Susquehanna River</a>.
It features a 190-acre (0.8&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) Nature Preserve, which contains forest and wetland areas and includes a six-acre (24,000 m&#x00b2;) pond, named Harpur Pond, that adjoins the campus.</p>

<h3>Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Binghamton University Alumni Association is nearly as old as the University itself.
The Harpur College Alumni Association elected its first officers in 1951, following the first Commencement.
As Harpur College grew and became a part of the State University of New York, the Alumni Association grew and today serves as the umbrella organization for a number of alumni groups and activities.</p>
<p>The University's Office of Alumni Relations supports the Alumni Association, working on behalf of its board of directors, an all-volunteer policy-setting body.
The Association represents more than 100,000 alumni, and is a non-dues paying organization.
All graduates automatically become members and are entitled to the quality services and activities provided by the association.</p>
<p>Among other events on and off campus, the Alumni Association sponsors the University's annual Homecoming weekend.</p>
