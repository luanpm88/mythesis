<h2>History</h2>
<p>IIT Bombay was the second <a>IIT</a> to be established in 1958 with assistance from <a>UNESCO</a> and with funds contributed by the <a>Soviet Union</a>.
UNESCO agreed to provide equipment and technical experts mainly from the Soviet Union, while the Government of India accepted the responsibility for all other expenses including the cost of the building project and recurring expenses.
<a>thumb|left|300px|IIT Bombay Main Building</a> The site chosen for the institute was <a>Powai</a>, eighteen miles (29&nbsp;km) from the city of Bombay (Mumbai), with an area of  which was given by the then Bombay State Government.
While construction was being completed, the first academic session of the Institute opened on July 25, 1958, in its temporary home at the Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) building in <a>Worli</a> (Bombay) with 100 students.
These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants for admission to the first year undergraduate programmes in Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical and <a>Metallurgical Engineering</a>.
One of the main objectives of establishing the Institute was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialised engineering and technological sciences.
The need for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years.</p>
<p>While the Institute was functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and <a>Jawaharlal Nehru</a> laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on March 10, 1959.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The IIT Bombay campus is located at Powai, a <a>suburb</a> in north eastern <a>Mumbai</a>, between the <a>Vihar</a> and <a>Powai</a> lakes.
It was designed by Vanu G. Bhuta for Messers G.M.  Bhuta &amp; Associates.
The four main entrances to the campus are the <em>Main Gate</em>, the <em>Middle Gate</em> (now closed for security reasons), the <em>Y-Point Gate</em> (also called the <em>Market Gate</em>) and the <em>Lake Side Gate</em>.
The <em>Main Gate</em> is the only one which is open 24 hours a day, while the <em>Y-Point Gate</em> is open only between 7&nbsp;a.m. to 11&nbsp;p.m. [[Image:IITB Lawn.jpg|thumb|250px|The <em>Tree of Knowledge</em> - a [[wrought iron]] sculpture in the lawns facing the Administrative Building at IIT Bombay]] The campus is divided into clusters of buildings.
The academic area chiefly comprises the Main Building, various Departmental annexures and auditoria.
All department annexures are connected by a corridor named <em>Infinite Corridor</em>.
Beyond the Convocation Hall lies the hostels (with the exception of Hostel 10, which is abutting the departmental annexure).
The hostels are numbered from 1 through 14, with Hostel 10 (under-graduate and post-graduate) and Hostel 11 (post-graduate) specially reserved for women.
<em>Tansa House</em> is a housing complex exclusively for the single male project staff.
It is the smallest hostel in IIT Bombay with 128 rooms.
The <em>Tulsi House</em> is  meant for  married research scholars.
