<p> <strong>Hampshire College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Amherst</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>.
It was founded in 1965 as an experiment in alternative education, to be in association with four other colleges in the <a>Pioneer Valley</a>: <a>Amherst College</a>, <a>Smith College</a>, <a>Mount Holyoke College</a>, and the <a>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>.
Together they are now known as the <a>Five Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>The College is widely known for its alternative curriculum, its focus on portfolios rather than distribution requirements, and its reliance on <a>narrative evaluations</a> instead of grades and <a>GPA</a>s.
It is known particularly for facilitating the study of film, music, theater, and the visual arts.
In some fields it is among the top undergraduate institutions in graduate-school enrollment: fifty-six percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and it is ranked 30th among all US <a>colleges</a> in the percentage of its graduates who go on to attain a <a>doctorate degree</a> (notably 1st among history doctorates), when adjusted for institutional size.
Its School of Cognitive Science was the first interdisciplinary undergraduate program in <a>cognitive science</a> and has few peers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College opened to students in 1970; its history dates to the immediate aftermath of <a>World War II</a>.
The first <em><a>The New College Plan</a></em> was drafted in 1958 by the presidents of the then-Four Colleges; it was revised several times as planning for the College began in the 1960s.
Many original ideas for non-traditional arrangements for the College's curriculum, campus, and life were discarded along the way.
Many new ideas generated during the planning process were not described in the original documents.</p>
<p>During several years immediately after its founding in the early 1970s, Hampshire College was among the most selective undergraduate programs in the United States.
Its admissions selectivity declined thereafter, but the school's number of applications increased in the late 1990s, allowing for greater admissions selectivity since then.
The college's rate of admissions is now comparable to that of many other small liberal arts colleges.</p>
<p>The school has struggled with financial difficulties since its founding.
Ceasing operations or merging into the <a>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> were seriously considered choices at various points.
In recent years the school is on more solid financial footing (though without a sizable endowment).
Its financial stability is often credited to the fundraising efforts of its most recent past presidents, Adele Simmons and <a>Gregory S. Prince, Jr.</a>.
The College has also distinguished itself recently with a draft for a &quot;sustainable campus plan&quot; and a &quot;cultural village&quot; through which organizations not directly affiliated with the school are located on its campus.
The &quot;cultural village&quot; includes the <a>National Yiddish Book Center</a> and the <a>Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art</a>.<a>thumb|right|200px|<strong>The

<p>On April 1, 2004, president Prince announced his retirement, effective at the end of 2004-05 academic year.
On April 5, 2005, the Board of Trustees named <a>Ralph Hexter</a>, formerly a dean at <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>'s College of Letters and Science, as the college's next president, effective August 1, 2005.
President Hexter was inaugurated on October 15, 2005.
The appointment made Hampshire one of a small number of colleges and universities in the United States with an openly <a>gay</a> president.</p>
<p>Some of the most important founding documents of Hampshire College are collected in the book <em>The Making of a College</em> (MIT Press, 1967; ISBN 0-262-66005-9).
<em>The Making of a College</em> is (as of 2003) out of print but available in electronic form from the Hampshire College Archives <a>thumb|left|200px|Dakin House dormitory</a> </p>
<p>Since 2002,  the school has taken several steps to expand the school and attract more academically conventional students.
The most significant change was a revision of the Division I program for first year students.
Before the fall of 2002, Division I traditionally consisted of four major exams, one in each of the academic departments and/or quantitative analysis.
These exams took one of three forms: a &quot;two-course option&quot;, where a student could take two sequential courses; a &quot;one-plus-one&quot;, where a Hampshire course supplements an outside course (AP score of a four or five, or a summer college class); or a project, which usually consists of a primary or significant secondary research paper, or an art production (a short film, a sculpture, etc.), and which stems from previous coursework.
Students were required to complete at least two project-based exams, while transfer students were usually waived one project requirement.
In fall of 2002, the new first-year program was started in response to high numbers of second and third year students who had not completed Division I.
The subsequent program mandates eight courses in the first year, at least one in each of the five schools.
This reduces the required work for passing Division I significantly, as up to 10 courses could be required under the older system.</p>
<h2>Academics and resources</h2>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Hampshire College describes itself as &quot;experimenting&quot; rather than &quot;experimental&quot; in order to emphasize the changing nature of its curriculum.
From its inception the curriculum has generally had certain non-traditional features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An emphasis on <em>project work</em> as well as, or instead of, courses.</li>
<li>Detailed <a><em>written evaluations</em></a> (as well as portfolio evaluations) for completed courses and projects, rather than letter or number grades.</li>
<li>A curriculum centered on <em>student interests</em>, with students taking an active role in designing their own concentrations and projects.</li>
<li>An emphasis on independent motivation and student organization, both within and without the college's formal curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>[[Image:emilydickinsonhall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Emily
Dickinson]] Hall, designed by the architecture firm of former faculty member <a>Norton Juster</a>, houses much of the humanities, creative writing, and theatre]]</p>
<p>The curriculum is divided into three &quot;Divisions&quot; rather than four years, and students complete these Divisions in varying amounts of time.
The administration has recently made efforts to encourage students to stick more closely to the traditional 4 year model by requiring three semesters be spent in Division I, three semesters be spent in Division II, and that Division III be completed in a year.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Division I</strong>, the distribution stage, requires students to complete one course in each of the five &quot;Schools of Thought&quot; and three other courses, either on or off campus.
(Until fall 2002, Division I required student-directed independent projects; the new system, designed with the goal of quicker and smoother student progress, has caused a great deal of controversy on campus.)</li>
<li><strong>Division II</strong> requires students to complete &quot;two full years&quot; of course work in their selected area(s) of study (which may or may not be traditional academic fields.)
Most students combine related subject matter to form an interdisciplinary concentration such as &quot;The chemistry of oil painting.&quot;
Still, some choose to concentrate in multiple areas without drawing such connections, instead simply concentrating in &quot;Both Chemistry and Oil Painting.&quot;
Some students, but perhaps the minority, complete an in depth concentration in one field only.
Each student is responsible for designing his or her own Division II in cooperation with a committee of at least two faculty members (who must give their approval).
Many students choose a faculty committee whose members represent their own interdisciplinary interests.
The Division II requirements also include a community service project and a multicultural perspectives requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Division III</strong>, the advanced project, requires students to complete an in-depth project in their field of choice (which is generally related to the Division II field).
Division III usually lasts one year and is completed while taking few or no courses, but two &quot;advanced learning activities,&quot; which might be courses, internships or specific independent studies, and may or may not be related to the Division III, are required.
A Division III topic can be a long written academic paper (in which case it is best considered as something between a traditional college's &quot;bachelor's&quot; or &quot;honors&quot; thesis and a Master's or other graduate thesis), but it can also be a collection of creative work (writing, painting, photography, and film are popular choices) or a hands-on engineering, invention, or social organizing project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Schools and programs</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|180px|Cole Science Center contains the School of Natural Science and administrative offices</a> The Hampshire College faculty are organized broadly in defined Schools; the Schools function much as Departments do at a traditional liberal arts college.
The Schools' names and definitions have varied over the College's history, but there have always been between three and five of them.
As of 2010, the Schools were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Cognitive Science</a> (CS): includes linguistics, most psychology, some philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science.</li>
<li><a>Humanities</a>, <a>Arts</a>, and <a>Cultural Studies</a> (HACU): includes film, some studio arts, literature, media studies, and most philosophy.</li>
<li>Critical Social Inquiry (CSI): includes most sociology and anthropology, economics, history, politics, and some psychology.</li>
<li><a>Natural Science</a> (NS): includes most traditional sciences, mathematics, and biological anthropology.</li>
<li><a>Interdisciplinary</a> <a>Arts</a> (IA): includes performing arts, some studio arts, and creative writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Five College Program in Peace and World Security Studies (PAWSS) is based at Hampshire; its director is <a>Michael Klare</a>.</p>
<h3>Five College Consortium</h3>
<p>Hampshire College is the youngest of the schools in the Five-College Consortium.
The other schools are <a>Amherst College</a>, <a>Mt.
Holyoke College</a>, <a>Smith College</a> and the <a>University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>.</p>
<p>Students at each of the schools may take classes and borrow books, generally without paying additional fees,  and incorporate all of the resources available at each of the schools, including internet access, dining halls, and so forth.
Among the five colleges, there are over 5,300 courses available, and over 8 million volumes between the five libraries.
The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) operates bus services between the schools and the greater <a>Pioneer Valley</a> area.</p>
<p>There are two joint departments in the consortium: Dance, and Astronomy.
Several certificate programs among the schools are available to students at any of the schools:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Prominent Campus Issues</h2>
<h3>Re-Radicalization</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2004, a student group calling itself the Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College (Re-Rad) emerged with a <a>manifesto</a> called <em>The Re-Making of a College</em>, which critiques what they see as a betrayal of Hampshire's founding ideas in alternative education and student-centered learning.
On May 3, 2004, the group staged a demonstration which packed the hall outside the President's office during an administrative meeting.
Response from the community has generally been amicable and Re-Rad has made some progress.</p>
<p>[[File:Hampshire College Yurt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Yurt]] is home to Hampshire's student radio station]] </p>
<p>The Re-Radicalization movement is responding in part to a new &quot;First-Year Plan&quot; entailing changes to the structure of the first year of study in the curriculum.
Beginning in the Fall of 2002, the requirements for passing Division I were changed so that first-year students would no longer be required to complete independent projects (see Curriculum above).
Though presently a major source of contention, this change is rapidly fading from memory as most of the students who entered into the old plan have graduated or are in their final year.
Re-Rad submitted its own counter-proposal in both 2006 and 2007; however, these proposals were not followed, and no follow-up was attempted.</p>
<p>The Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College assisted the administration in launching a pilot program known as 'mentored independent study'.
In it, ten third semester students were paired with Division III students with similar academic interests to complete a small study, all under the observation of, and subject to the approval of a faculty member.
The program was judged successful and has been institutionalized.</p>
<p>While some students worry about what they see as Hampshire's headlong plunge into normality, the circumstances of Hampshire's founding tends to perennially attract students who revive the questions about education on which the institution was founded and challenge the administration to honor them.
Unsurprisingly, then, Re-Rad was not the first student push of its type.
Efforts like it have sprung up at Hampshire with some regularity throughout the years, with varying degrees of impact.
In 1996, student Chris Kawecki spearheaded a similar push called the Radical Departure, calling for a more holistic, organic integration of education into students' lives.
The most durable legacy of the Radical Departure was EPEC, a series of student-led non-credit courses.
A more detailed account of movements such as these can be found in a  history of Hampshire student activities, a Division III thesis written by alumnus Timothy Shary, subsequently a faculty member at <a>Clark University</a> of <a>Worcester, Massachusetts</a>,  and <a>University of Oklahoma</a></p>
<h2>In the media</h2>
<p>Hampshire was the first college in the nation to decide to divest from <a>apartheid South Africa</a>, in 1979 (with the nearby <a>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> second).
Legal and financial research undertaken by student Michael Current and faculty member Kurtis Gordon was promoted nationally by business activists Douglas Tooley and Debbie Knight.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In November 2001, a controversial All-Community Vote at Hampshire declared the school opposed to the recently-launched <a>War on Terrorism</a>, another national first which drew national media attention, including scathing reports from <a>Rupert Murdoch</a>'s <a>Fox News Channel</a> and the <a>New York Post</a> (&quot;Kooky College Condemns War&quot;).
<em><a>Saturday Night Live</a></em> had a regular sketch, &quot;<a>Jarret's Room</a>&quot;, starring <a>Jimmy Fallon</a> which purports to take place at Hampshire College but is grossly inaccurate, referring to non-existent buildings (&quot;McGuinn Hall&quot; which is actually the Sociology and Social Work building at fellow cast member <a>Amy Poehler</a>'s alma mater, <a>Boston College</a>) and featuring yearbooks, tests, seniors, fraternities, 3-person dorm rooms, and a football team, none of which have ever existed at the school (although in the Fall 2005, 2006, and 2007 semesters the college experienced a higher than expected number of freshmen and temporarily had to convert some of the common spaces into 3-person dorms).
The sketch also claims that the college is actually in <a>New Hampshire</a> (a common mistake).</p>
<p>Alumnus <a>Ken Burns</a> wrote of the college: &quot;Hampshire College is a perfect American place.
If we look back at the history of our country, the things we celebrate were outside of the mainstream.
Much of the world operated under a tyrannical model, but Americans said, 'We will govern ourselves.'
So, too, Hampshire asked, at its founding, the difficult questions of how we might educate ourselves...
When I entered Hampshire, I found it to be the most exciting place on earth.&quot;
<a>Loren Pope</a> wrote of Hampshire in the college guide <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>: &quot;Today no college has students whose intellectual thyroids are more active or whose minds are more compassionately engaged.&quot;
In 2006, the <a>Princeton Review</a> named Hampshire College one of the nation&#x2019;s &quot;best value&quot; undergraduate institutions in its book &quot;America&#x2019;s Best Value Colleges&quot;.</p>
