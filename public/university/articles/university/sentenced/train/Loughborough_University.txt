<p>  <strong>Loughborough University</strong> is a <a>campus university</a> located in the <a>market town</a> of <a>Loughborough</a>, <a>Leicestershire</a>, in the <a>East Midlands</a> of <a>England</a>.</p>
<p>It has been a university since 1966, but the institution dates back to 1909, when the then Loughborough Technical Institute began with a focus on skills and knowledge which would be directly applicable in the wider world, a tradition which continues to this day, with the UNIEI funded <em>Annual Survey on University Technology Transfer Activities</em> finding Loughborough to be the most efficient technology transfer operation in the UK.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The University traces its roots back to 1909 when a Technical Institute was founded in the town centre.
There followed a period of rapid expansion during which the Institute was renamed Loughborough College and the development of the present campus began.</p>
<p>In the early years, efforts were made to mimic the environment of an <a>Oxbridge</a> college (e.g.
requiring students to wear gowns to lectures) whilst maintaining a strong practical counterbalance to academic learning.
During <a>World War I</a>, the Institute served as an &quot;instructional factory&quot;, training workers for the munitions industry.</p>
<h3>The Loughborough colleges</h3>
<p>Following the war, the Institute fragmented into four separate colleges:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Loughborough Training College</strong> (teacher training)</li>
  <li><strong>Loughborough College of Art</strong> (art and design)</li>
  <li><a>Loughborough College of Further Education</a> (technical and vocational)</li>
  <li><strong>Loughborough College of Technology</strong> (technology and science)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last was to become the nucleus of the present university.
Its rapid expansion from a small provincial college was due largely to the efforts of its Principal, Dr <a>Herbert Schofield</a> (1882&#x2013;1963).</p>
<p>Loughborough University has been awarded the Best Student Experience four years running (2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009) according to the Times Higher Education  and was also named the 2008 <em><a>Sunday Times</a></em> &quot;<a>University of the Year</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>The University has been chosen as a base by both the Great Britain team  and the <a>Japanese</a> team for the <a>2012 Summer Olympics</a> [<a>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100618f1.html</a>].</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|University Centre of Cricket Excellence (UCCE) cricket ground</a> The University's main campus is in the <a>Leicestershire</a> town of <a>Loughborough</a> and until 2003 it was developing a secondary campus at <a>Peterborough</a>.
The Loughborough campus (once the estate of Burleigh Hall) covers an area of 433 acres (1.75&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), and includes academic departments, halls of residence, the Students' Union, two gyms, gardens and playing fields.
Of particular interest are the walled garden, the &quot;garden of remembrance&quot;, the Hazlerigg-Rutland Hall fountain-courtyard and the Bastard Gates.
In the central quadrangle of the campus stands a famous <a>cedar</a>, which has often appeared as a symbol for the University.
Unfortunately a heavy snowfall in December 1990 led to the collapse of the upper canopy which gave the tree its distinctive shape.
The recent acquisition by the University of Holywell Park from Advantica Technologies and a  parcel of land between New Ashby Road and Holywell Park from 3M Heath Care Limited has increased the size of the campus to .</p>
<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>The University has 24 academic departments and over 30 research institutes, divided between three faculties: Science, Engineering and Social Science &amp; Humanities.
It has approximately 17,500 students, 61% of whom are undergraduates and 32% are pursuing postgraduate courses and/or research.
Its current <a>Chancellor</a> is Sir <a>John Jennings</a>, CBE, FRSE (the previous chancellor, Sir <a>Denis Rooke</a>, OM, CBE, retired from the position in summer 2003, having served for fourteen years), and its <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> is Professor <a>Shirley Pearce</a>.
The previous Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sir <a>David Wallace</a> CBE FRS DL, was appointed to the Mastership of <a>Churchill College</a>, <a>Cambridge</a>, in succession to Sir <a>John Boyd</a> KCMG.
David Wallace was Vice Chancellor of Loughborough University between 1994 until December 2005.</p>

The University has won six <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a>s for Higher and Further Education for work with the aeronautical and automotive industries (1994); support for developing countries (1998); for a pioneering role in developing applications of modern optics and laser technologies (2000); for its world leading role in sports research, education and development (2002); for its world leading role in social policy in recognition of its outstanding and widely respected work in evaluating and helping develop social policy-related programmes, such as those for cared for children, social security policy, crime prevention, education initiatives and young carers (2006); and for recognition of its vehicle, road and driver safety research (2007).</p>
<p>In <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> 2007 league tables, Loughborough was ranked 9th.
In the 2007 Times rankings it was 6th overall but fell to 12th position in the latest edition for 2008.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|230px|Loughborough University logo at the entrance on Epinal Way</a></p>
<p>The official colour of the University is <a>African Violet</a>, with students taking part in practical sessions on Sport &amp; Exercise Science courses having to wear the school kit in this colour.
The <a>coat of arms</a> incorporates several symbols relevant to the history of the Loughborough area, including <a>Offa of Mercia</a>'s cross (a symbol of the ancient kingdom of <a>Mercia</a>, within whose borders the town now stands) and the <a>peafowl</a> from the arms of the <a>Dukes of Rutland</a>.
The motto of the University is <em>veritate scientia labore</em> (&quot;with truth, wisdom and labour&quot;, or, alternatively, &quot;with truth, knowledge and work&quot;, depending on the translation).</p>
<p>The University has a strong tradition in both engineering and sporting.
From its strong engineering and technical background it has now expanded, becoming a centre of excellence in the field of <a>sport</a>s and <a>sports science</a>.
It has graduated a number of world-class athletes including <a>Paula Radcliffe</a> and <a>Lord Coe</a>.
In keeping with this tradition, Loughborough University students have won the <a>British Universities Sports Association</a> championship every year for over three decades.
Sports students were previously entitled to wear a different style of <a>scarf</a> from other undergraduates however this has now been discontinued.
The university is the home of the England and Wales Cricket Board's <a>National Academy</a>, opened in November 2003.</p>
<p><a>thumb|center|600px|Loughborough University, Epinal Way entrance.</a></p>
<p>The phonetic spelling &quot;Lufbra&quot; is sometimes used amongst students, graduates, and in Students' Union publications, and the name is also often abbreviated to &quot;lboro&quot; both casually as well as within more formal/academic circles, stemmed from the university's <a>URL</a> of &quot;www.lboro.ac.uk&quot;.</p>
<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <a>students' union</a> is unusual in English universities, in that its premises are owned by the students themselves.
The Union building sits in the north-eastern corner of the campus, and offers a range of facilities for clubs and societies, retail, entertainment and other activities.
The Union has five rooms, each with its own theme.
The most popular night in the Union is 'FND', on a Friday.
'Hey Ewe' is also well attended on Wednesday nights, which is an evening to celebrate the University's sport successes of the day.
'Stupid Tuesday' is also a popular night at the union.
Other nights at the union include 'Universal Thursday' - a night primarily aimed at international students but open to all; and 'Subversion' - a fortnightly rock and metal night, held every other Saturday, and run by the university's <a>rock society</a>.
Most night staff - including bar staff, security and crew - are current students.</p>
<p>Along with Loughborough Students Union's numerous sports clubs, the Union hosts and organises many other activities and societies.
LSU is also home to Loughborough Campus Radio, LSUTV and <em>Label Magazine</em>.</p>
