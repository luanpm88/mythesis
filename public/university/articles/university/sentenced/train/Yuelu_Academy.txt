<p>The <strong>Yuelu Academy</strong> (also as known as the &quot;<strong>Yuelu Academy of Classical Learning</strong>&quot;, ) is located on the east side of <a>Yuelu Mountain</a> in <a>Changsha</a>, the <a>capital</a> of <a>Hunan</a> <a>province</a>, <a>China</a>, on the west bank of the <a>Xiang River</a>.</p>
<p>It was founded in 976, the 9th year of the <a>Song Dynasty</a> under the reign of <a>Emperor Kaibao</a>, and was one of four most renowned Shuyuan (<a>academies</a> of higher learning).</p>
<p>The renowned <a>Confucian scholars</a> <a>Zhu Xi</a> and <a>Zhang Shi</a> both lectured at the academy.
</p>
<p>In 1903 the academy became a <a>university</a>, and in 1926 it was officially named <a>Hunan University</a>.</p>
<p><a>300px|left|thumb|Yuelu Academy</a> As one of the four most prestigious academies over the last 1000 years in China, Yuelu Academy has been a famous institution of higher learning as well as a centre of academic activities and cultures since it was formally set up in 976 (the <a>Northern Song Dynasty</a>).
The Academy, which has survived the Song, <a>Yuan</a>, <a>Ming</a> and <a>Qing</a> dynasties, was converted into Hunan Institute of Higher Learning in 1903.
It was later renamed <a>Hunan Normal College</a>, Hunan Public Polytechnic School, and finally <a>Hunan University</a> in 1926.

<p>The academy has witnessed more than a thousand years of history and is the only one of the ancient Chinese academies of Classical Learning to have evolved into a modern institution of higher learning.
The historical transformation from Yuelu Academy to Hunan University can be seen as the epitome of the development of China's <a>higher education</a>, a change which mirrors the vicissitudes of <a>education system in mainland China</a>.
As a part of <a>Hunan University</a>, today the academy is a center of publication and research of the ancient <a>Chinese language</a>, and is one of the most important academic and <a>cultural</a> centers in China.</p>
