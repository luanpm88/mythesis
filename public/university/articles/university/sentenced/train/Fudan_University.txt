<p></p>
<p><strong>Fudan University</strong> (), located in <a>Shanghai</a>, is one of the oldest and most selective <a>universities</a> in China, and is a member of the <a>C9 League</a>.
Its institutional predecessor was founded in 1905, shortly before the end of China's imperial <a>Qing dynasty</a>.
Fudan University is composed of four campuses, including Handan (&#x90af;&#x9132;), Fenglin (&#x6953;&#x6797;), Zhangjiang (&#x5f35;&#x6c5f;), and Jiangwan (&#x6c5f;&#x7063;).
It is a comprehensive university highly ranked in <a>physical sciences</a>, <a>humanities</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, and <a>medicine</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Fudan University historic gate</a>   Fudan was initially known as Fudan College in 1905.
The two Chinese characters Fu (&#x5fa9;) and Dan (&#x65e6;), literally meaning &quot;(heavenly light shines) day after day&quot;, were chosen by the distinguished educator in modern Chinese history, Father <a>Ma Xiangbo</a> <a>S.J.</a> (&#x9a6c;&#x76f8;&#x4f2f;), from the <a>Confucian Classics</a> (&#x300a;&#x5c1a;&#x4e66;&#x5927;&#x4f20;&#x2022;&#x865e;&#x590f;&#x4f20;&#x300b;): &quot;Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces&quot; (&#x65e5;&#x6708;&#x5149;&#x83ef;&#xff0c;&#x65e6;&#x5fa9;&#x65e6;&#x516e;).
In 1911 during the <a>Xinhai Revolution</a> the college was taken up as the headquarters of the <a>Guangfu Army</a> and closed down for almost one year.
The university motto comes from Analects Book 19.6(&#x300a;&#x8ad6;&#x8a9e;&#x2022;&#x5b50;&#x5f35;&#x300b;): &#x535a;&#x5b78;&#x800c;&#x7be4;&#x5fd7;,&#x5207;&#x554f;&#x800c;&#x8fd1;&#x601d;, which means &quot;to learn extensively and adhere to aspirations, to inquire earnestly and reflect with self application&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1917, Fudan Public School became a <a>private university</a> named the Private Fudan University (&#x79c1;&#x7acb;&#x5fa9;&#x65e6;&#x5927;&#x5b78;), and also had a <a>middle school</a> and <a>university-preparatory school</a>.
In 1929, Fudan adjusted its departments, expanded to include the Journalism Department, Municipals Department, Law Department and Education Department, totalling 17 departments devoted to Arts, Science, Law and Business.
<a>thumb|250px|Fudan University Museum of School History</a> In 1937, Fudan moved with the <a>Kuomintang</a> to the inland city of <a>Beibei</a>, <a>Chongqing</a>, later the temporary capital.
On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the <a>National Government</a> of the <a>Republic of China</a> voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a <a>public university</a> with <a>Wu Nanxuan</a> as its president.
Fudan University then became National Fudan University (&#x570b;&#x7acb;&#x5fa9;&#x65e6;&#x5927;&#x5b78;).
Five years later, it moved back to <a>Shanghai</a>.</p>
<p>After the founding of the <a>People's Republic of China</a>, Fudan lost its &quot;National&quot; appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public.
Fudan was the first university to be adjusted by the new government in 1952 and modelled on <a>Soviet education</a>.
The original departments were changed, and Arts and Science departments from at least ten other universities in eastern China were added.
This not only added to basic academic offerings of Fudan, but also gathered many talented academics from <a>Jiangsu</a>, <a>Zhejiang</a>, <a>Anhui</a> and <a>Shanghai</a>, including <a>Su Buqing</a>, <a>Chen Jiangong</a>, <a>Tan Jiazhen</a>, and <a>Lu Hefu</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, after the <a>Cultural Revolution</a>, the university was changed to a modern, comprehensive-style university.</p>
<p>Fudan University and <a>Shanghai Medical University</a> were merged on April 27, 2000.</p>

<h3>Admissions</h3>
<h4>Undergraduate program</h4>

Fudan University has been carrying out a profound reform in its undergraduate program, aiming at quality higher education and intending to train more creative talents for the world.
The reform begins with the construction of a credit system.</p>
<p>Fudan has reconstructed its course system to suit education goals.
A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in arts and sciences has been implemented.
Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields.
All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training.
According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules.
In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies.
In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours.
Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to a wider range of knowledge.</p>
<h4>Graduate program</h4>
<p>The Graduate School of Fudan University was established on November 6, 1984 and the Graduate School of Shanghai Medical University on January 25, 1985.
Both were among the first 22 graduate schools after China's universities officially resumed enrolling graduate students.
With the merger of Shanghai Medical University and Fudan University in April 2000, the two graduate schools were joined to be a new Graduate School of Fudan University.
Therefore, a comprehensive graduate education structure is formed with disciplines in humanities, law, sciences, engineering, medicine and management.</p>
<h4>International students</h4>
<p>Since the 1950s, Fudan has enrolled international students &mdash; one of the first few institutions in China to do so.
Since then, Fudan has accepted and trained over 10,000 foreign students from 100 countries and regions worldwide.
At the end of 2006, there were 2,812 international students studying at Fudan University, ranked number 2 in the nation.
Half of them were actively pursuing degrees, the rest were general visiting scholars.
In addition, Fudan enrolls over 1700 short-term students each year.
</p>
<p>The international student programs consist of degree program and non-degree program.
The university has also established a Bachelor of Arts program called the &quot;Chinese language for international students&quot; and there have been seven groups of graduates.
Besides all levels of Chinese language teaching, the university has opened courses such as Chinese literature, Chinese history, Chinese economy, Chinese philosophy and Chinese law for interested international students.
These courses will introduce students to basic knowledge of Chinese social economy, history and culture, according to their different requirements.</p>
<p>The <a>International Students Office</a> is responsible for the management of all international students at Fudan University.</p>
<h3>Ranking</h3>
<p>In 2009, Fudan University ranked third overall among universities in mainland China in the <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (From 2010, two separate rankings will be produced, one by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and the other by <a>QS World University Rankings</a>.).
It was placed in the world's top 200 list, ranked 103.
In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>, it was ranked 105th in the world.
In the subject tables compiled by QS for the rankings, Fudan is ranked 54 in the world for <a>social sciences</a>, 69 for <a>life sciences</a> &amp; <a>biomedicine</a>, 64 for <a>art</a>s and <a>humanities</a> 92 for <a>natural sciences</a> and 117 for <a>engineering</a> and <a>technology</a>.</p>

<p>Li Deng-hui, ex-president of Fudan instructed the students to unite, serve and sacrifice.
A well-known 77-year-old architect from the Alumni Association in Taipei also said that strength lies in unity and that Fudan alumni are expected to serve as an example in the increasing mergers of higher learning schools in mainland China.</p>
