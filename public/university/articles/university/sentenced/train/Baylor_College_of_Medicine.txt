<p> </p>
<p><strong>Baylor College of Medicine</strong>, located in the <a>Texas Medical Center</a> in <a>Houston</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>USA</a>, is a highly regarded medical school and leading center for <a>biomedical research</a> and clinical care.
The school, located in the middle of the largest medical center in the world, has affiliations with eight teaching hospitals, including the following venerable institutions: <a>Texas Children's Hospital</a>, <a>MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>, <a>The Methodist Hospital</a>, The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR), <a>Menninger Clinic</a>, The <a>Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a>, <a>St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital</a>/<a>The Texas Heart Institute</a> and the Level I Trauma Center <a>Ben Taub General Hospital</a>.
The medical school has been consistently considered in the top-tier of programs in the country and is particularly noted for having the lowest tuition among all private medical schools in the US.
Its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is among the top 10 percent of all graduate schools in the United States.
On June 21, 2010, Dr. Paul Klotman was named as the new President and CEO of the Baylor College of Medicine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was formed in 1900 in <a>Dallas, Texas</a>, by a small group of physicians who aimed to improve medical practice in North Texas.
Originally called the University of Dallas Medical Department, the school opened its doors October 30, 1900, with 81 students.
In 1903, an alliance with <a>Baylor University</a> in Waco was formed and the name changed to Baylor University College of Medicine.</p>
<p>By 1918, Baylor University College of Medicine was the only private medical school in Texas.
The M.D. Anderson Foundation invited Baylor University College to join the newly formed <a>Texas Medical Center</a> in 1943.
The College opened in the medical center on July 12, 1943, in a converted Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. building, with 131 students.
four years later, the College moved into its present site in The Roy and Lillie Cullen Building, the first building completed in the Texas Medical Center.</p>
<p>In 1948, <a>Michael E. DeBakey</a> joined the faculty as chair of the Department of Surgery, and the following year, The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences was established.
The College's rise in prominence began in the 1950s when Dr. DeBakey's innovative surgical techniques garnered international attention.
In the 1960s, the college underwent its first major expansion.</p>
<p>In 1969, the College separated from Baylor University and became an independent institution, which allowed it access to federal research funding.
The institution's name changed to Baylor College of Medicine.
That same year, the College entered into an agreement with the state legislature to double its class size in order to increase the number of physicians in Texas.</p>
<p>Baylor College of Medicine opened the Baylor Clinic on June 29, 2005, and was in the process of building a state-of-the-art integrated hospital and clinic, to be called The Baylor Hospital, which was slated to open sometime in 2011.
In 2009, the college postponed construction, due to lack of funds.
The outer shell of the hospital has been completed, while the interiors remain unfinished.
BCM is looking for an affiliate partner to complete construction.
In 2009, BCM entered into extensive discussions with <a>Rice University</a> regarding a potential merger between the two Houston institutions.
After many meetings between the two schools, the boards at both institutions mutually decided that each school would be better off as an independent entity.
Following this development, Baylor University entered into talks with BCM with a goal of strengthening ties to the medical school, however, the BCM board decided that it would remain an independent institution.</p>
<h2>Medical school</h2>
<p>Each year around 172 medical students join the medical school, about 75% of whom are Texas residents.
For entering medical students in 2008, the average undergraduate GPA was 3.85 and the average MCAT score was 34.5, making it one of the top five medical schools in the country when measured by matriculant statistics.
Baylor College of Medicine is the only private medical school in the southwest region of the United States, and has the lowest tuition of all private medical schools in the United States.
Baylor is one of the few medical schools in the United States that is structured with an accelerated 1.5 year preclinical curriculum (the others are <a>Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> in <a>New York City</a> and the <a>University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine</a> in <a>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>).</p>
<p>Baylor College of Medicine was ranked 24th overall in the 2010 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> top medical schools for research, down from 10th in 2007.
Prior to 2009, BCM has consistently ranked in the top 10-15 schools in the country.
However, in 2008, under the direction of former President Dr.
Peter Traber, Baylor changed the way it reported its funding, electing to only report funding received through the College itself as opposed to the more commonly used method of reporting all funding of the medical schools' affiliates.
The reported funding is averaged across two years, so although Baylor's funding increased in this span of time, this change in reporting to USNWR caused a substantial drop in ranking over two years resulting in BCM dropping below the 13th for the first time in the USNWR rankings history.</p>
<h2>Graduate school</h2>
<p>In 2005 BCM ranked 13th in terms of research funding from the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, and its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences ranked 22nd for best Ph.D. program in the biological sciences (2007).
Additionally, several individual departments earn particularly heavy NIH funding, receiving several &quot;Top Ten&quot; rankings by the NIH in 2005:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No.
1: Molecular &amp; <a>Cellular Biology</a>; Molecular and <a>Human Genetics</a>; and <a>Pediatrics</a></li>
  <li>No.
2: <a>Biochemistry</a> and <a>Molecular Biology</a></li>
  <li>No.
8: <a>Neurosciences</a></li>
</ul>
<p>100 students join the graduate program each year, of which one-half were women and one-third were graduates from foreign schools.
The average graduate student GPA is 3.5 and the average GRE score is above the 70th percentile.</p>
<p>Many departments of the graduate school collaborate with <a>Rice University</a> and other institutions within the <a>Texas Medical Center</a>.
Currently, 489 graduate students are enrolled in one of the fourteen different PhD programs.
These programs are:</p>

<h2>Physician Assistant program</h2>
<p>Baylor College of Medicine is also home to a <a>Physician Assistant</a> (PA) program.
Forty PA students are accepted each year.
For PA students entering in 2004, the average GPA was 3.70 and the average GRE score was 1169 verbal/quantitative and 4.9 analytical.
Baylor College of Medicine ranked 7th in the 2007 <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> rankings for Physician Assistant schools.
The overall passing rate for all graduates of the PA Program on the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination is 97 percent with a 100 percent pass rate for the past eight years.</p>
<h2>Residency training</h2>
<p>Baylor College of Medicine offers residency training in a wide variety of specialties.
Notable departments at the college include the Department of <a>Pediatrics</a>, led until 2003 by world-renowned pediatrician Dr. <a>Ralph Feigin</a> and currently by Dr. <a>Mark Kline</a>, a world expert on pediatric HIV, and the Department of <a>Surgery</a> founded by Dr. <a>Michael E. DeBakey</a>, the world-renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, and chaired by Dr. <a>F.
Charles Brunicardi</a>, the Debakey/Bard Professor of Surgery.</p>
<h2>Hospital affiliation</h2>
<p>BCM is affiliated with many of the hospitals that make the <a>Texas Medical Center</a> the largest medical center in the world.
These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a></li>
  <li><a>Ben Taub General Hospital</a></li>
  <li><a>St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital</a>/<a>The Texas Heart Institute</a></li>
  <li><a>The Methodist Hospital</a></li>
  <li><a>The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center</a></li>
  <li><a>Texas Children's Hospital</a></li>
  <li><a>Memorial Hermann - The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research</a></li>
  <li><a>Menninger Clinic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cooperating Patient Care Institutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Community Health Centers</li>
  <li>Cullen Bayou Place</li>
  <li><a>DePelchin Children's Center</a></li>
  <li>Houston Child Guidance Center</li>
  <li>Jewish Family Service Cancer Center</li>

  <li><a>Woman's Hospital of Texas</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While <a>The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center</a> is a component of the University of Texas System, its faculty and trainees may be affiliated with either Baylor or the University of Texas medical school in Houston, which is located across the street from Baylor.
<a>Methodist Hospital</a> had been Baylor's primary private teaching hospital for many decades.
Baylor and Methodist dissolved some of their connections during a conflict in 2004 for reasons that seem to revolve around a planned ambulatory care center and ownership of the physicians' private practices.
Methodist and Baylor retain a number of important affiliations and Baylor medical students and residents continue to rotate through The Methodist Hospital during some rotations.
In the meantime, Baylor has strengthened its ties to other Medical Center hospitals like MD Anderson and St. Luke's, leading, for example, to the recent decision for MD Anderson's chairman of neurosurgery to also be chair at Baylor.</p>
<p>Baylor initiated plans to build its own hospital and clinic after ties with <a>Methodist Hospital</a> were dissolved.
The Baylor Clinic is currently in operation and the 600 bed not-for-profit hospital's exteriors are complete but construction is currently suspended on the interiors due to economic concerns.
The hospital will be located in Texas Medical Center on the McNair Campus of Baylor College of Medicine near <a>Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a> on Old Spanish Trail.
Once the Hospital building is fully complete the Baylor Clinic will move from its current location to the McNair Campus.</p>
<h2>Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative</h2>
<p>The Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) (<a>http://bayloraids.org</a>)
at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital was established in 1996, and has rapidly become the world's largest university-based program dedicated to global pediatric and family HIV/AIDS care and treatment, health professional training and clinical research.
Baylor constructed and opened the world's two largest centers for the care and treatment of HIV-infected children and families, the Romanian-American Children's Center in Constanta, Romania in 2001, and the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence in Gaborone, Botswana in 2003.
These centers have transformed the care and treatment of pediatric HIV/AIDS in the two countries, making Romania and Botswana two of a precious few countries worldwide where children are at least proportionately represented among those accessing HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
BIPAI has replicated these successes in Uganda, Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, and Burkina Faso, where it has entered into partnership with the Ministries of Health to scale up pediatric HIV/AIDS care and treatment, and build and open new Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence.</p>
<p>BIPAI also has created the Pediatric AIDS Corps; a model program to place up to 250 American pediatricians and infectious disease specialists in its African centers to vastly expand capacity for pediatric HIV/AIDS care and treatment and health professional training.
Major funders of BIPAI's activities include NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Abbott Laboratories, and numerous private and corporate foundations.</p>
