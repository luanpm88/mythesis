<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding principles and Civil War involvement</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Hillsdale College's coat-of-arms</a> <a>thumb|right|Hillsdale in the nineteenth century</a> <a>thumb|right|Hillsdale College's historic Central Hall and clocktower</a>  Hillsdale College was established as <strong>Michigan Central College</strong> in <a>Spring Arbor, Michigan</a> on December 4, 1844.
In 1853, the college moved to <a>Hillsdale, Michigan</a> and assumed its current name.
Hillsdale was the first American college to prohibit in its charter all <a>discrimination</a> based on race, religion, or <a>sex</a>.
Black students were admitted immediately after the college's 1844 founding, and the College became the second</p>
<p>Many Hillsdale students served in the <a>Union army</a> during the <a>American Civil War</a>.
A higher percentage of Hillsdale students enlisted than from any other non-military college.
Of the more than 400 men serving, half became officers.
During the conflict, four Hillsdale students received the <a>Medal of Honor</a>, three became generals, and many more served as regimental commanders.
For the more than sixty that died, a monument was erected in their honor, which now stands between Kendall and Lane Halls.
Hillsdale College's policies came under fire in the 1970s following the enactment of <a>affirmative action</a> legislation.
Because some students were receiving federal loans, the federal government asserted that it could require Hillsdale College to submit Assurance of Compliance forms mandated by <a>Title IX</a> as a condition of the continued receipt of federal financial assistance by two hundred Hillsdale students.
Hillsdale refused compliance on the grounds that its own policies were less discriminatory than those the federal government would impose.
This ongoing dispute with the <a>Department of Health, Education, and Welfare</a> (HEW) began to intensify in 1979 when the College filed a petition for judicial review in the <a>United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a>, asking the court to overturn a previous decision by the Reviewing Authority, Office of <a>Civil Rights</a> of HEW.
In December 1982, the Sixth Circuit upheld Hillsdale's refusal to sign the compliance forms but also ruled that government aid to individual students could be terminated without a finding that a college actually discriminated.
In February 1984, in a related case, <em><a>Grove City College v. Bell</a></em>, the <a>Supreme Court</a> required every college or university to fulfill federal requirements - past and future requirements - if its students received federal aid.
As a result of the court's decision, Hillsdale withdrew from all federal assistance beginning with the 1984-85 academic year; Grove City, the defendant in that case, followed Hillsdale's lead four years later.
Beginning with the 2007-2008 academic year, Hillsdale also stopped accepting Michigan state assistance, instead matching any funds that a student would have received from the state with its own aid.
</p>
<p>Since 2007, Hillsdale's entire operating budget of the college, including scholarships, come from private funding and endowments.</p>

<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>Since 1981, Hillsdale has presented National Leadership Seminars nationwide on issues of politics, economics and culture.
To date, more than 19,000 community, business and media leaders around the country have attended these seminars.
Past speakers include <a>Steve Forbes</a>, <a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a>Dan Quayle</a>, <a>Tony Snow</a>, <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>, and <a>Caspar Weinberger</a>.
</p>
<p>In 1987, Hillsdale College's dean of women initiated a lawsuit against another faculty member, alleging he had made slanderous remarks about her in the context of a controversy around her role in the selection of the editor of the student newspaper, <a><em>The Hillsdale Collegian</em></a>.
A letter to the editor signed by sixteen faculty members questioned the appropriateness of legal action in this dispute.
One of the three faculty members who had prepared the letter, history professor Warren Treadgold, was informed afterwards that his probationary appointment would not be renewed.
A subsequent investigation by a committee of the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> concluded that Hillsdale had violated the Association's standards in the context of the nonreappointment and found evidence that the administration had made that decision because of Treadgold's role in preparing the letter, even though this activity &quot;should have been protected under generally accepted principles of <a>academic freedom</a>.&quot;
