<p><strong>Drew University</strong> is a private university located in <a>Madison</a>, <a>New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>Originally established as the <strong>Drew Theological Seminary</strong> in 1867, the university later expanded to include an undergraduate <a>liberal arts college</a> in 1928 and commenced a program of graduate studies in 1955.
Nicknamed the &quot;University in the Forest&quot; because of the relative serenity of its wooded 186 acres (753,000 m&#x00b2;) relative to the school's suburban surroundings, Drew University maintains a combined undergraduate and graduate enrollment of approximately 2,500 students, with the majority living on-campus.</p>
<p>While Drew is affiliated with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>, it makes no religious demands of its students.
Many of the Theological School's students and faculty are United Methodist, and the General Commission on Archives and History of the <a>United Methodist Church</a> is housed on campus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>200px|left</a></p>
<p>In 1867, <a>Daniel Drew</a> (1797&#x2013;1879), a <a>financier</a> and <a>railroad</a> <a>tycoon</a>, endowed his <a>antebellum</a> estate in Madison for the purpose of establishing the <a>Drew Theological Seminary</a>.
<a>John McClintock</a> was the first president of the Seminary.
To this day, the Theological Seminary continues to graduate candidates for service in the ministry; however, the institution grew to include a <a>liberal arts</a> curriculum.</p>
<p>Dr.
<a>James Strong</a> first published his seminal work, <a>Strong's Concordance</a>, in 1890, during his tenure as Professor of exegetical theology at Drew Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>The College of Liberal Arts admitted its first class of 12 students in 1928, after the trustees of the Drew Theological Seminary voted to accept a gift of $1.5 million from brothers Arthur and Leonard Baldwin to build and endow such an institution, and to change the name of the institution to Drew University.
In 1955, a Graduate School became the third of the university's degree-granting entities.</p>
<p>From its beginnings, the College of Liberal Arts has honored its founders' wish that it be <a>ecumenical</a> in its choice of faculty and students.
The Baldwins also asked that the new institution be named <em>Brothers College</em> in recognition of their extraordinary relationship.
The name was later changed to the <em>College of Liberal Arts</em>, but its major academic building still bears its original name.</p>
<p>In its early years, Drew provided educational opportunities for women, through enrollment in religious classes.
However, for a brief time, Drew became an all-male institution, during the 1930s until 1942.</p>
<p>During the <a>Second World War</a>, the draft threatened to take too many of Drew's students and the college of liberal arts responded by enrolling both women and <a>US Navy</a> recruits, through a <a>V-12 Navy College Training Program</a>.
At this time, Drew became <a>coeducation</a>al.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, the College also established, with generous assistance from the <a>Mellon Foundation</a>, a now widely-imitated freshman seminar program.
It allows first-year students to participate, with faculty who also serve as their academic advisers, in intensive study of a topic of hopefully mutual interest.
Interdisciplinary study became a focus of the curriculum as well, with the creation of majors in <a>behavioral studies</a>, <a>neuroscience</a> and <a>Russian Studies</a>, and minors in such fields as <a>American studies</a>, <a>arts administration</a> and <a>museology</a>, <a>business management</a>, <a>dance</a>, <a>public health</a> and <a>writing</a>.</p>
<p>In 1984, psychology professors Philip Jensen and Richard Detweiler led an effort to provide a personal computer and application software to all incoming freshman, a program referred to as the &quot;Computer Initiative&quot;.
Drew was the first liberal arts college to have such a requirement.
The Computer Initiative differentiates Drew from other liberal arts colleges, and continues to this day.
As a result, Drew has considerably fewer public computing labs than comparable schools its size, utilizing the centrally-managed student laptops for instructional and general-purpose computing use.</p>
<p><a>Thomas Kean</a>, former <a>Governor of New Jersey</a> (1982&#x2013;1990) and Co-Chairman of the <a>National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</a>, was Drew's president for 15 years and stepped down in June, 2005.
Robert Weisbuch, former President of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, was named Drew's eleventh president in July 2005 and formally inaugurated on April 28, 2006.</p>
<p>During his tenure as president, Kean succeeded in adding new faculty in <a>African</a>, <a>Asian</a>, <a>Russian</a>, and <a>Middle Eastern Studies</a>, significantly increased opportunities for students to study abroad, increased applications from prospective students, nearly tripled the school's endowment, and committed more than $60 million to construction of new buildings and renovation of older buildings&#x2014;principally student residence halls.
In the event, several of these faculty were not retained, and the program in Asian Studies fell victim to a lack of cooperation among concerned faculty.</p>
<p>In July, 2007, it was reported that Drew University's rising undergraduate tuition cost, at a then minimum of $34,230, had outranked <a>Princeton University</a> at $33,000 minimum and <a>Stevens Institute of Technology</a> at $32,000 minimum, making Drew the most expensive school in the state of New Jersey.
This report, however, uses a purely geographic context that does not reflect the divergent natures of these institutions.
Drew University remains in the middle range of the schools with which it is directly comparable.
The university also offers considerable financial aid, which, in 2007, reduced the average tuition for an entering student to $18,500.</p>
<p>Drew University is home to the <a>Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey</a>, and the archives of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>200px|right</a></p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>Drew University offers programs leading to the traditional undergraduate degree of <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> (<a>B.A.</a>) through its <strong>College of Liberal Arts</strong>.
Known for its academic programs, Drew University has been compared to some of the top liberal arts college in the nation.</p>
<p>The school's philosophy is that Drew students fulfill a general education program that allows them to shape an individual academic program to serve their own needs and interests, while taking traditional core liberal arts courses.
The school states that its programs emphasize depth, independent research, and experiential and collaborative teaming.
A declared minor is required in the general education program, and students choose from structured disciplinary and interdisciplinary offerings, or may design a minor course of study, subject to faculty approval.</p>
<p>The <strong>College of Liberal Arts</strong> provides major concentrations in 31 academic areas, including: <a>Anthropology</a>, <a>Art</a>, <a>Art History</a>, <a>Behavioral Science</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>Biological Anthropology</a>, <a>Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a>, <a>Business</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Chinese</a>, <a>Classics</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Environmental Studies &amp; Sustainability</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>German</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Music</a>, <a>Neurosciences</a> (includes psychobiology), <a>Pan-African Studies</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Political Science</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Religious Studies</a>, <a>Sociology</a>, <a>Spanish</a>, <a>Theater Arts</a>, <a>Women's</a> and <a>Gender Studies</a>.</p>
<p>Minor concentrations are available in <a>American Studies</a>, <a>Archeology</a>, <a>Arts Administration and Museology</a>, <a>Asian Studies</a>, <a>Business, Society, and Culture</a>, <a>Dance</a>, <a>European Studies</a>, <a>Holocaust Studies</a>, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Italian</a>, <a>Jewish Studies</a>, <a>Latin American Studies</a>, <a>Linguistic Studies</a>, <a>Middle Eastern Studies</a>, <a>Public Health</a>, <a>Russian</a>, <a>Western Heritage</a>, <a>Women's</a> and <a>Gender Studies</a>, and <a>Writing</a>.</p>
<h3>Graduate</h3>
<p><a>150px|left</a> The <strong>Caspersen School of Graduate Studies</strong> offers the traditional <a>Master of Arts</a> (M.A.) and <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) degrees.
The <a>Master of Philosophy</a> (M.Phil.)
degree is awarded to Ph.D. students at the completion of their comprehensive exams, as a recognition of having A.B.D., or <a>All But Dissertation</a> status in completion of the Ph.D. Areas of study include: Book History (M.A. only), English Literature, Modern History &amp; Literature, and Women's Studies (M.A. only, Ph.D. concentration).
It also offers an innovative interdisciplinary arts and letters program offering <a>Master of Letters</a> (M.Litt.)
and <a>Doctor of Letters</a> (D.Litt.)
degrees as well as a program in Medical Humanities, offering a Certificate of Medical Humanities (C.M.H.), as well as Masters (M.M.H.) and Doctoral degrees (D.M.H.).
The Caspersen School is currently developing a graduate program in Education.
The Caspersen School is known for its particular faculty strengths in the study of <a>Willa Cather</a>, intellectual history, and medical humanities.</p>
<p>In 2006, the <strong><a>Graduate Division of Religion</a></strong> (GDR)&#x2014;with programs in Biblical Studies, Historical Studies, Liturgical Studies (this area is currently not accepting students), Religion &amp; Society, and Theological &amp; Philosophical Studies&#x2014;was created as an administrative move of the graduate programs in religion from the Caspersen School to the Theological School.
The change was made to reflect current trends in the academic study of religion.
The Ph.D degree is offered in these areas, and many students elect to pursue a concentration in Women's Studies.
Drew is particularly strong in the areas of constructive and systematic theology, liturgical studies, theological ethics, feminist issues in religion, and post-colonial Biblical studies.</p>
<p>The transition of the GDR from the Caspersen School was the first of many changes initiated in the school recently.
Since 2006, the school has opened a Master of Arts in Teaching and reformulated its Ph.D. programs to focus on a single, interdisciplinary History program, entitled History and Culture, which will be admitting M.A. candidates for the Fall of 2009 and Ph.D. candidates for the Fall of 2010.
The school is, furthermore, in the process of considering the addition of other programs that will further emphasize its approach to an interdisciplinary approach to the Humanities.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Theological School</strong> offers degree programs designed to train candidates for the ministry.
While affiliated with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>, its programs are open to individuals of all faiths.
Degrees offered include the <a>Master of Divinity</a> (M.Div.), <a>Master of Arts</a> (M.A.), <a>Master of Arts in Ministry</a> (M.A.), <a>Master of Sacred Theology</a> (S.T.M.), and the <a>Doctor of Ministry</a> (D.Min.).
The faculty of the Theological School are largely the same as in the Graduate Division of Religion, and are additionally noted in the areas of evangelism and environmental issues in religion.
The Theological School is often noted for its strong ties to <a>Korean Methodism</a>.</p>
<h3>Other programs</h3>
<p>Drew also offers a few other programs through the office of <strong>Continuing University Education.</strong>
These programs include professional teacher continuing education; some community education programs; certificates in pharmacological laboratory analysis (in a partnership with <a>Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>) and in historic preservation; and a post-baccalaureate, pre-medical preparation program.</p>
