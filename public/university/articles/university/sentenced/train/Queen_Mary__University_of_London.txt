<p></p>
<p> <strong>Queen Mary, University of London</strong> (informally <strong>Queen Mary</strong>) is a public research university located in <a>London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a> and a constituent college of the federal <a>University of London</a>.
Queen Mary has roots dating back to 1785.
The modern Queen Mary was formed from the merger of four historic colleges and since joining the University of London in 1915 has grown to become one of its largest colleges.
</p>
<p>Queen Mary's main campus is based in the <a>Tower Hamlets</a> area of <a>central London</a>, with other campuses located in <a>Holborn</a>, <a>Smithfield</a> and <a>Whitechapel</a>.
It has around 16,000 full-time students and 3,000 academic staff and had a total income of &#x00a3;265 million in 2008/09, of which &#x00a3;64 million was from research grants and contracts.
Queen Mary is organised into three faculties - the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and Engineering and the <a>Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry</a> - within which there are 21 academic departments and institutes.</p>
<p>In the official 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, Queen Mary was ranked 11th by the <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> and 13th by <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> out of the 132 UK higher education institutions assessed.
In the 2010 <em><a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a></em> Queen Mary is ranked 35th in Europe and 120th in the world.
Queen Mary's degree courses in English, History, Politics, Linguistics, Law and those based at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry are particularly strong, ranking in the top 10 of national academic league tables.
There are 6 <a>Nobel Laureates</a> amongst Queen Mary's alumni and current and former staff.</p>
<p>Queen Mary is a member of the <a>1994 Group</a>, the <a>Association of Commonwealth Universities</a> and <a>Universities UK</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Queen Mary's origins lie in the mergers, over the years, of four older colleges: <strong>Queen Mary College</strong>, <strong><a>Westfield College</a></strong>, <strong><a>St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College</a></strong> and the <strong><a>London Hospital Medical College</a></strong>.
In 1989 Queen Mary merged with Westfield College to form <strong>Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College</strong>.
Although teaching began at the London Hospital Medical College in 1785, it did not become part of Queen Mary until 1995.
In that same year the two medical schools merged together to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College, but Barts and The London has, to some extent, retained its own identity.
In 2000, the college adopted its present title of <strong>Queen Mary, University of London</strong>, but the official legal title remains <strong>Queen Mary and Westfield College</strong>.
Although not directly responsible for the conception of the People's Palace, the novel did much to popularise it.</p>
<p>The trustees of the Beaumont Trust, administering funds left by <a>Barber Beaumont</a>, purchased the site of the former Bancroft's School from the <a>Drapers' Company</a>.
On 20 May 1885 the Drapers' Court of Assistants resolved to grant &#x00a3;20,000 &quot;for the provision of the technical schools of the People's Palace.&quot;
The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886 and on 14 May 1887 <a>Queen Victoria</a> opened the palace's Queen's Hall as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace's east wing.</p>
<p>The technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892.
When opening them, the Master of the Drapers' Company declared their aims to be &quot;to improve the scientific and technical knowledge of apprentices and workmen engaged in industrial life&quot;.
However others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End.
The conflicting demands of pleasure and education were identified by the Assistant Charity Commissioner as early as 1891 and for the next forty years this was to dog the People's Palace.
In 1892 the Drapers' Company provided &#x00a3;7000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income.</p>
<h4>Into the University of London</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|Part of the Charterhouse Square site</a> The classes reached a peak of 8000 tickets in 1892&#x2013;1893 but fell to less than half for the following year, due to competition from the London School Board, despite the Palace's classes being more advanced.
With the level of teaching grew, in 1895 John Hatton, Director of Evening Classes (1892&#x2013;1896; later Director of Studies 1896&#x2013;1908 and Principal 1908&#x2013;1933) proposed introducing a course of study leading to the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree of the <a>University of London</a>.
By the turn of the century the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other Professors, were recognised as Teachers of the University of London.
In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds &quot;for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature&quot;, led to the College being told it was &quot;of the highest importance that there should be a School of the University in the faculties of Arts, Science and Engineering within easy reach of the very large population of the East End of London.&quot;
The educational part of the People's Palace was admitted on an initial three year trial basis as a School of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as <em>East London College</em>.
In 1910 the College's status in the University was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915.
During this period the organisation of the governors of the People's Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People's Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex.</p>
<p>During the <a>First World War</a> the College admitted students from the <a>London Hospital Medical College</a> who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together.
After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east.
In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories.
The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the <a>Board of Education</a>.
In April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the <a>Privy Council</a> for a <a>Royal Charter</a>, but on the advice of the Drapers' Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended amongst other things to reamalgamate the People's Palace and the College, with guaranteed provision of the Queen's Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space.</p>
<p>In the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen's Hall, though both the College and the winter gardens escaped.
In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the College which would then apply for a Charter alone.
The Drapers' Company obtained St Helen's Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People's Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the College.
Separation was now achieved.
The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that &quot;east London&quot; carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the College and its graduates.
With the initial proposed name, &quot;Queen's College&quot;, having already been taken by <a>another institution</a> and &quot;Victoria College&quot; felt to be unoriginal, &quot;Queen Mary College&quot; was settled on.
The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by <a>Queen Mary</a> herself.</p>
<h4>Under the Charter</h4>
<p><a>thumb|The Queens' Building</a> During the <a>Second World War</a> the College was evacuated to <a>Cambridge</a>, where it shared with <a>King's College</a>.
Meanwhile the Mile End site was requisitioned for war work and was for a time used as the Municipal Offices of Stepney Borough Council.
After the war the College returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion.</p>
<p>The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the College itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the College site now became vacant.
The former church of St Benets' to the immediate east of the College was now defunct and was demolished in 1950, with the space used to build a new block for <a>physics</a>, but most of the acquisitions in the immediate post war years were to the west of the college.
Even the new People's Palace was no longer able to meet its needs and it was acquired by the College along with several pieces of land that together formed a significant continuous stretch along the <a>Mile End Road</a>.
New buildings for engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens' Building (to reflect the support and patronage of both Queen Mary and <a>Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother</a>).</p>
<p>Limited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in <a>South Woodford</a> (now directly connected to <a>Mile End tube station</a> by means of the <a>Central Line</a>'s eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established.
Consequently, student numbers continued to expand.
The College also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society's clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), despite being physically separated from what was now a campus to the west.</p>
<p>From the mid 1960s until the mid 1980s the College was in a period of uncertainty and flux.
Much planning was dominated by the &quot;BLQ scheme&quot; which proposed to link Queen Mary College with the <a>London Hospital Medical College</a> and <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College</a> with a joint facility in Mile End, but the land was not yet available.
Over the period land that come onto the market was purchased with the intention to consolidate as soon as possible.
The Queen Mary College Act 1973 was passed &quot;to authorise the disposal of the Nuevo burial ground in the <a>London Borough of Tower Hamlets</a> and to authorise the use for other purposes thereof...&quot; and gave the authority to disinter and reinter most of the graves to <a>Dytchleys</a>.
A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew's was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges.</p>
<p>At the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances caused much concern through the university sector and led to a reorganisation of the <a>University of London</a>.
At Queen Mary some subjects, such as <a>Russian</a> and <a>Classics</a> were discontinued, whilst the College became one of five in the University with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from <a>Westfield College</a>, <a>Chelsea College</a>, <a>Queen Elizabeth College</a> and <a>Bedford College</a>.</p>
<p>From the mid 1980s onwards the College began expanding across the newly acquired land to the east, taking the campus to the <a>Regent's Canal</a>.
A part of the burial ground remains to this day but the rest of the area has been absorbed by the College's expansion.
The long planned Pre Clinical Medicine building for the BLQ Scheme finally materialised in the late 1980s, further strengthening the ties between the three colleges.
In 2007 parts of the School of Law &#x2014; postgraduate facilities and the <a>Centre for Commercial Law Studies</a>&#x2014; moved to premises in <a>Lincoln's Inn Fields</a> in central London.</p>
<h3>Westfield College</h3>

<p>Continued uncertainty about the future of Westfield College led to its merger with Queen Mary in 1989 to form <strong>Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College</strong> (often abbreviated to <strong>QMW</strong>).
Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold off.</p>
<h3>Merger with the medical schools</h3>
<p>A reorganisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the freestanding medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions.
In 1995 the <a>London Hospital Medical College</a> and <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College</a> merged together and into Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College to form the entity now named <a>Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry</a>.</p>
<h3>Public name change</h3>
<p>In 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to <strong>Queen Mary, University of London</strong>; however, the College's charter has not been reissued and its legal name remains Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College.</p>
<h3>Nuclear reactor</h3>
<p>From 1964 until 1982 QMC maintained a nuclear reactor, the first to be built for a UK university.
Initially sited beneath Mile End Road, it was moved to the new QMC Nucleonics Laboratory in Marshgate Lane in 1967, upgraded in 1968, and decommissioned in 1982, with the site licence surrendered in November 1983.
The Marshgate Lane site became part of the <a>Olympic Park</a> from 2006; in response to safety concerns about the former purpose of the site, a <a>Greenpeace</a> spokesman was quoted as saying &quot;In our view there's nothing to worry about.&quot;

<h2>Collaborative international programmes</h2>
<h3>Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</h3>
<p> Queen Mary offers a groundbreaking joint degree programme with Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, one of China's top engineering universities.
This was the first of its kind to be approved by the PRC Ministry of Education: it is taught 50% by each institution; in English; in Beijing; by staff who fly out from Queen Mary to teach its part of the programme; and the students receive two degrees, one from each university.
The programmes are in Telecommunications and Management and Ecommerce Engineering and Law.
Almost 2,000 students are studying on these programmes in 2009 and the first cohort graduated in the Summer of 2008.
The joint programmes have been praised by the UK Quality Assurance Agency; the PRC Ministry of Education; and the UK Institution of Engineering and Technology.</p>
<h3>University of London Institute in Paris</h3>
<p>Queen Mary collaborates with <a>Royal Holloway, University of London</a> to help run programmes at a college of the University of London in <a>Paris</a>, <a>France</a>, known as the <a>University of London Institute in Paris</a> (ULIP), enabling undergraduate and graduate students to study University of London ratified French Studies degrees in France.</p>
