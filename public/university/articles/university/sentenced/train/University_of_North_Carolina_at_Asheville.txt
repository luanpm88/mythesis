<p>UNC Asheville was founded in 1927 as <strong>Buncombe County Junior College</strong>, part of the Buncombe County public school system.
In 1930 the school merged with the College of the City of Asheville (founded in 1928) to form <strong>Biltmore Junior College</strong>.
In 1934 the college was renamed <strong>Biltmore College</strong> and placed in the control of a board of trustees.
1936 brought both a further change of name to <strong>Asheville-Biltmore College</strong> and a transfer of power to the Asheville City School Board.</p>
<p>In 1961 Asheville-Biltmore College moved to the present UNCA campus in north Asheville.
In 1963 it became a state-supported four-year college, and awarded its first bachelor's degrees in 1966.
Its first residence halls were built in 1967.
It adopted its current name in 1969 upon becoming part of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, since 1972 called the <a>University of North Carolina System</a>.
It is the designated public <a>liberal arts university</a> within that system, and has been classified as a Liberal Arts I institution since 1992.</p>
<p>UNCA has more than 207 full-time faculty members and an enrollment of approximately 3,600 students.
