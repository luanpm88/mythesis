<p>  <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong>, commonly called <strong><em>Illinois Tech</em></strong> or <strong>IIT</strong>, is a private <a>Ph.D.</a>-granting university located in <a>Chicago</a>, <a>Illinois</a>, with programs in <a>engineering</a>, <a>science</a>, <a>psychology</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>communications</a>, <a>industrial technology</a>, <a>information technology</a>, <a>design</a>, and <a>law</a>.
It is a member of the <a>Association of Independent Technological Universities</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>IIT was formed in 1940 by the merger of Armour Institute of Technology (founded in 1893) and Lewis Institute (founded in 1895).</p>
<h3>Armour Institute of Technology</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Main building of Armour Tech on right ca. 1914</a> The Armour Institute of Technology was founded in 1893 with one million dollars from <a>Philip Danforth Armour</a>, Sr., a prominent Chicago <a>meat packer</a> and grain merchant.
Armour had heard Chicago <a>minister</a> <a>Frank W. Gunsaulus</a> say that with a million dollars he would build a school that would be open to students of all backgrounds instead of just the elite.
After the sermon, Armour approached Gunsaulus and asked if he was serious about his claim.
When Gunsaulus said yes, Armour told him that if he came by his office in the morning, he would give him the million dollars.
Armour also stipulated that Gunsaulus become the first <a>president</a> of the school, and Gunsaulus served as president of Armour Tech from its founding in 1893 until his death in 1921.
Gunsaulus's sermon thus became known as the &quot;Million Dollar Sermon&quot;.
Armour Institute of Technology opened its doors on September 14, 1893.
It shared the neighborhood now known as <a>Bronzeville</a> with many historic places: <a>Comiskey Park</a> was a few blocks away, west of what is now the <a>Dan Ryan Expressway</a>; the land used to expand the campus in the 1940s through 1970s was home to many of Chicago's old famous <a>jazz</a> and <a>blues</a> clubs, with performers like <a>Louis Armstrong</a> highlighting the neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Lewis Institute</h3>
<p>[[Image:Lewis Institute 1903.gif|thumb|Lewis
Institute [[circa|ca.]]
1903]] Founded in 1895 from the estate of the Chicago real estate investor <a>Allen Cleveland Lewis</a>, <a>Lewis Institute</a> stood where the <a>United Center</a> now stands.
Allen Lewis was one of many investors to descend on Chicago after the 1871 <a>Great Chicago Fire</a>, and helped to rebuild the city's west side.
Under its first director, <a>George Noble Carman</a>, Lewis Institute was the first institution to offer adult education programs, making it the first <a>junior college</a> in the United States.
The Institute offered courses in engineering, sciences, and technology, but also featured courses in home economics and other domestic arts.
Lewis Institute offered a program in which a young child was borrowed from a member of the community and would be cared for by students for up to a year.
As the first President, Carman helped create <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, the first educational <a>accreditation</a> board.
Armour's campus became the permanent home of the new school while Lewis's campus was briefly repurposed by the City of Chicago as a civic building before being demolished for the construction of the <a>United Center</a>.
The resistance by Lewis supporters led to a court battle in which the original will of Allen C. Lewis was dissolved.
The Lewis Institute and Armour Institute completed the merger in July 1940, with the first academic year for the new Illinois Institute of Technology beginning in the fall of the same year.
The <a>Armour College of Engineering</a> is composed of five departments: the Department of <a>Biomedical Engineering</a>, the Department of <a>Biological</a> and <a>Chemical Engineering</a>, the Department of <a>Civil</a>, <a>Architectural</a> and <a>Environmental Engineering</a>, the Department of <a>Mechanical</a>, <a>Materials</a> and <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> and the Department of <a>Computer</a> and <a>Electrical Engineering</a>.
</p>
<p>The College of Science and Letters is divided into six departments: the Department of <a>Applied Mathematics</a>; the Department of <a>Biological</a>, <a>Chemical</a> and <a>Physical Sciences</a>; the Department of <a>Computer Science</a>; the Lewis Department of <a>Humanities</a>; the Department of Mathematics and Science Education; and the Department of <a>Social Sciences</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a>Institute of Design</a> was founded in 1937 as the New Bauhaus: Chicago School of Design by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.
It became known as the Institute of Design in 1944 and later joined Illinois Institute of Technology in 1949.</p>
<p>IIT also contains the College of <a>Architecture</a>.
This College began in 1895 when trustees of Armour Institute and Art Institute merged the architectural programs of both schools to form the Chicago School of Architecture of Armour Institute.
</p>
<p>The Institute of <a>Psychology</a> was created in  1996.
Originally a part of the Lewis College of Science and Letters, the first psychology degrees were awarded in 1926.
</p>
<p>The Center for Professional Development opened in 2001 in order to provide technology oriented education for working professionals.</p>
<p>In December 2009, IIT announced the formation of the School of Applied Technology, which is composed of undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Industrial Technology and Management (INTM) and Information Technology and Management (ITM), as well as non-credit Professional Learning Programs (PLP).
These programs were all formerly part of the Center for Professional Development.
</p>
<p><a>Chicago-Kent College of Law</a> began in 1886 with law clerks receiving tutorials from Appellate Judge Joseph M. Bailey in order to prepare for the newly instated Illinois Bar Examination.
By 1888 these evening sessions developed into formal classes and the Chicago College of Law was established.
It wasn't until 1969 that the school was incorporated into Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>IIT also offers many dual admission programs including programs in medicine, optometry, pharmacy, law, and business.
The programs in medicine are particularly competitive and include an 8-year program with <a>Midwestern University</a> leading to a D.O. degree and a 6-year program with <a>Rush University</a> leading to a M.D. degree, both of which are earned after satisfactory completion of a bachelor's degree from IIT.
The IIT/Midwestern program accepts anywhere from 5-10 students each year, and the IIT/Rush program accepts anywhere from 0-4 students each year.</p>

It is named for the founder of <a>Motorola</a>.]]
The  IIT main campus is centered around 33rd and State Streets, approximately  south of the <a>Chicago Loop</a> in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood on the <a>South Side</a> of Chicago, part of the <a>Douglas</a> <a>community area</a>.
Also known as the Black Metropolis District, the area is a landmark in African-American history.
Following rapid growth during the <a>Great Migration</a> of African-Americans from the south between 1910 and 1920, it became home to numerous African-American owned businesses and cultural institutions and offered an alternative to the race restrictions that were prevalent in the rest of the city.
The nine extant structures from that period were added jointly to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1986 and designated a <a>Chicago Landmark</a> in 1998.</p>
<p>In 1941, the <a>Chicago Housing Authority</a> began erecting massive public housing developments in the area.
By 1990, the IIT campus was encircled by high-rise housing projects rife with crime.
The projects were demolished beginning in the 1999, Neighborhood features include <a>U.S. Cellular Field</a>, home of the <a>Chicago White Sox</a>, <a>Burnham Park</a> and <a>31st Street Beach</a> on the <a>Lake Michigan</a> waterfront, and historical buildings from the heyday of the Black Metropolis era, including the <a>Chicago Bee Building</a>, the <a>Eighth Regiment Armory</a>, and the <a>Overton Hygienic Building</a>.
The campus is bordered on the west by the <a>Chicago 'L'</a><a>Red Line</a>, which runs parallel to Lake Michigan north to <a>Rogers Park</a> and south to 95th street.
The <a>Green Line</a> bisects the campus and runs north to the Loop and then west to the near west suburbs and south to the <a>Museum Campus</a> and the <a>University of Chicago</a>.</p>

The campus, roughly bounded between 31st and 35th streets, <a>Michigan Avenue</a> and the <a>Dan Ryan Expressway</a>, was designed by <a>modernist</a> architect <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>, &quot;one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture&quot;, who chaired the IIT School of Architecture from 1938 to 1958.
Van der Rohe's master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived and the campus, with twenty of his works, is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world.
The layout of the campus departs radically from &quot;traditional college quadrangles and limestone buildings&quot;.
The campus was landscaped by van der Rohe's close colleague at IIT, <a>Alfred Caldwell</a>, &quot;the last representative of the <a>Prairie School</a> of landscape architects.&quot;
Known as &quot;the nature poet&quot;, Caldwell's plan reinforced van der Rohe's design with &quot;landscaping planted in a free-flowing manner, which in its interaction with the pristine qualities of the architecture, introduce[d] a poetic aspect.&quot;</p>
<p>On the west side of Main Campus are three <a>red brick</a> buildings that were original to Armour Institute, built between 1891 and 1901.
In 1938, <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> began his 20-year tenure as director of IIT's School of Architecture (1938&#x2013;1959).
The university was on the verge of building a brand new campus, to be one of the nation's first federally funded urban renewal projects.
Mies was given carte blanche in the large commission, and the university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized.
From 1943 to 1957, several new Mies buildings rose across campus, including the  <a>S.R. Crown Hall</a>, which houses the architecture school, and was designated a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> in 2001.
The IIT Main Campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>In 2010, IIT received <a>the Princeton Review</a>'s highest <a>sustainability</a> rating among universities in Illinois, tied with the <a>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p> There are numerous student organizations available on campus, including religious groups, academic groups, and student activity groups.
</p>
<p>Three of IIT's major student organizations serve the entire student body: the Student Government Association (SGA), the Student Union Board (UB), and <em>TechNews</em>.
SGA is the governing student body of IIT and acts as a liaison between the university administration and the student body, serves as a forum to express student opinion, and provides certain services to student organizations such as official recognition and distribution of funds.
UB serves as the main event programming group and plans over 180 on and off-campus events for students per year.
Since 2005, UB has been particularly active and has increased the frequency of student activities, and is responsible for the emergence of the school spirit and booster group Scarlet Fever; UB it has been active since its founding on November 23, 1938.
<em>TechNews</em> is the campus paper and serves as a news outlet for campus interests and as another outlet for student opinion in both a weekly paper edition and online format; it has existed since at least the 1930s.
</p>
<p>IIT hosts a campus radio station, <a>WIIT</a>, with an antenna located atop Main Building and a radio studio in the McCormick Tribune Campus Center.
In September 2007, IIT opened a nine-hole <a>disc golf</a> course which weaves around the academic buildings on the Main Campus and is the first disc golf course to appear within the Chicago city limits.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the opening of the <a>McCormick Tribune Campus Center</a>, the on-campus pub and bowling alley known as &quot;The Bog&quot; ceased operations in 2003.
However, in response to students, faculty, and staff who missed the former campus hangout, the Bog reopened in February 2007 and is now open every Thursday and Friday night offering <a>bowling</a>, <a>billiards</a>, <a>table tennis</a>, and <a>video games</a>.
The Bog is also home to the campus bar, which serves <a>beer</a> and <a>wine</a>, and hosts weekly events such as comedians, live bands, or karaoke nights on its stage.</p>
<p>On the sixth floor of Main Building is the IIT Model Railroad Club.
Founded in 1948, the club builds and runs an <a>H0 scale</a> <a>model railway</a> layout that occupies much of the floor.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2007, the third generation of <a>a cappella</a> groups was formed,  The TechTonics, a coed group of students.
Within a year the organization expanded and now includes an all-male group, the Crown Joules, and an all-female group, the X-Chromotones.
IIT A Cappella performs a variety of shows on campus as well as off campus and in the midwest.
They perform shows at the end of each semester which showcase everything they have learned.</p>
<p>The Illinois Institute of Technology Main Campus has an established Greek System, which consists of 7 fraternities and 3 sororities.
Fraternities <a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Phi</a>, <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, <a>Alpha Sigma Phi</a>, <a>Phi Kappa Sigma</a>, and <a>Triangle</a> fraternity and sororities <a>Kappa Phi Delta</a>, and <a>Alpha Sigma Alpha</a> have chapter houses.
The <a>Omega Delta</a> fraternity and <a>Zeta Pi Omega</a> sorority do not.</p>
