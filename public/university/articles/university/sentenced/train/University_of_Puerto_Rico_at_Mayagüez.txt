<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>University of Puerto Rico</a> was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903 emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system.
In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university.
Eloquent evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at <a>R&#x00ed;o Piedras</a> in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayag&#x00fc;ez in 1911 as a <a>land-grant university</a>.</p>
<p>The founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), <a>Jos&#x00e9; de Diego</a> and Carmelo Alemar.
In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mec&#x00e1;nicas (CAAM).</p>
<p>In 1918, an earthquake and a fire caused significant damage to the institution.
The ruins of the entrance of one of the buildings, Degetau Hall &#x2014; which not only withstood the earthquake, but proved to be almost indestructible after the rebuilt hall was torn down in the late 1940s &#x2014; would later become the emblem of the institution.
In 1988, the archway ruins (the <a>portico</a>) was moved, landcaped and turned into a monument.</p>
<p>The campus rectory was located at the <a>Jos&#x00e9; de Diego building</a>, the oldest standing edification within the campus, built in 1911.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

<p>The UPR-Mayag&#x00fc;ez campus encompasses approximately 315&nbsp;acres (1.27&nbsp;km2).
The campus has a sports complex that includes a gym, a weight room, rooms for dance/aerobic classes, courts for basketball, a tennis and volleyball complex, a natatorium, an outdoor sports field and the Rafael A. Mangual Coliseum.
The campus also offers two cafeterias, a bookstore, a bank, a lounge called La Cueva de Tarz&#x00e1;n (Tarzan&#x2019;s cave) and a computer center, although several academic departments operate their own computer laboratories.</p>
<h3>Library system</h3>
<p> The Mayag&#x00fc;ez Campus General Library serves the local campus community as well as residents of Mayag&#x00fc;ez and nearby towns.
It fully supports UPRM education and research mission and objectives by providing adequate library and information resources, facilities and services.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Puerto Rico at Mayag&#x00fc;ez consists of four major colleges:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>College of Agricultural Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>College of Arts and Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>College of Business Administration</a></li>
  <li><a>College of Engineering</a></li>
</ul>
<p>UPRM offers 52 bachelor's programs, 28 master's programs and five doctoral programs.</p>
<p>UPRM offers undergraduate and graduate education in all of their four colleges.
Doctoral programs are offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering.</p>
<p>The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the <a>Agricultural Experiment Station</a> and the Agricultural Extension Service.</p>
<p>UPRM College of Engineering graduation rates are higher than the University of Wisconsin, Texas A &amp; M, University of Washington and the University of Minnesota.
It has increased the percentage of its faculty with doctorates from 66.5% in the 1999-00 academic year to 79.4% in 2007.</p>
<p>The Mayag&#x00fc;ez campus is one of two land-grant universities in the tropics and the only one where Spanish is the native language (although English is also used extensively).
The campus provides a unique setting and, to some extent, it is in a privileged position to serve as an international center for studies, training, and research in the fields of agricultural sciences.</p>
<p>The academic calendar has two semesters: fall (early August to mid-December) and spring (early January to mid-May).
While textbooks and research materials used at the <a>University of Puerto Rico</a> are often in English, Spanish is the language of instruction in most courses at UPRM, and students are required to have a working knowledge of the English language.
The individual professor decides the language used in class lectures and in student evaluation activities.</p>
<p>The UPRM Office of Institutional Research and Planning reported a total enrollment of 12,380 students for the 2006 fall semester.
In 2006 the institution had an acceptance rate of 62%.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>UPR-Mayag&#x00fc;ez is the most important center in the Atlantic region for the study of tropical marine science due to its location, facilities, and first-rate researchers.
The research facilities includes the Puerto Rico Water Resources and Environmental Research Institute, the Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI), the Research and Development Center, the Agricultural Research Station and the Caribbean Atmospheric Research Center (ATMOSCarib).</p>
<p>The College of Engineering offers modern computerized laboratories for teaching, measuring fatigue and fractures in different materials, designing manufactured products and the processes to build them, and <a>computer design</a>.
There is a Center for Civil Infrastructure used to design structures resistant to natural disasters and transportation systems.
Other research areas include development of <a>solar powered vehicles</a> and boats, use of <a>satellite photography</a> to study earth phenomena, and study of the environmental impact of industrial <a>toxins</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerous research laboratories under direct faculty supervision, the Mayag&#x00fc;ez campus has several research and development institutes that provide valuable support for research activities.
Arts and Sciences is the College with the largest portfolio of funded research at the university and the highest number of patents, mostly from the Physics Department.
Most of the  science education funded efforts are in the following areas: <a>Science</a> and <a>Mathematics Education</a>, <a>Detection of Explosives</a>, <a>Environmental Sciences</a>, <a>Biotechnology</a>, <a>Ecosystems</a> and <a>Conservation</a>, <a>Oceanic processes</a>, <a>Nanotechnology</a> and Advanced Materials, <a>Human Behavior</a> and <a>Energy</a>.</p>
<p>Its researchers, faculty, graduate and undergraduate students are at the forefront of areas such as <a>Tsunamis</a>, Nanotechnology, <a>Protein</a>, Oceanic processes, <a>Bio&#x2010;markers</a>, <a>Coral reefs</a>, <a>Applied Economics</a>, <a>Disasters</a>, monitoring of <a>Seismic activity</a>, <a>Biodiversity</a> and <a>Physical Oceanography</a>.</p>
