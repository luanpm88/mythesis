<p>   <strong>Al-Azhar University</strong> (pronounced &quot;AZ-har&quot;, ; <em></em>, &quot;the Noble Azhar University&quot;) in <a>Egypt</a>, founded in 970~972 as a <a>madrasa</a>, is the chief centre of <a>Arabic literature</a> and <a>Sunni</a> <a>Islamic learning</a> in the world.</p>
<p>The Al-Azhar is considered by one author the <a>world's second oldest surviving degree granting university</a>.
However, this claim on precedence appears to confound the distinct nature of madrasas and <a>medieval universities</a> which followed very different historical trajectories until the former were expanded to the latter in <a>modern times</a>, and fails to take into account that the Islamic <a>Ijazah</a> certificate deviated in concept and procedure from the medieval <a>doctorate</a> out of which <a>modern university degrees</a> evolved.</code></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Al-Azhar University concerns itself with the religious syllabus, which pays special attention to the Quranic sciences and traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, on the one hand, while on the other hand the university teaches all the modern fields of science.
In 1961, according to Al-Azhar university's legislatory law No. 103, new colleges of applied sciences, such as the faculties of Medicine and Engineering, were introduced to Al-Azhar university.
These newly introduced faculties are not duplicates of their counterparts in other universities because they combine the empirical sciences with the religious sciences.
Alongside the Egyptian students who are studying at Al-Azhar university, there are also many other students from various Islamic and European countries.
These foreign Muslim students have exactly the same rights as the Egyptian students.</p>
<p>The madrasa was founded by the <a>Fatimid</a> dynasty of Egypt, descended from <a>Fatimah</a>, daughter of <a>Muhammad</a>.
Fatimah was called <em>Az-Zahra</em> (the brilliant), and the university was named in her honor.</p>
<p>Studies began at Al-Azhar in the month of <a>Ramadan</a>, 975 AD.
According to Syed Farid Alatas, the <a>Jami'ah</a> had <a>faculties</a> in <a>Islamic law</a> and <a>jurisprudence</a>, <a>Arabic grammar</a>, <a>Islamic astronomy</a>, <a>Islamic philosophy</a>, and <a>logic</a>.
In the 12th century, following the overthrow of the Shia <a>Fatimid</a> dynasty, Sultan <a>Saladin</a> (the founder of the staunchly Sunni <a>Ayyubid Dynasty</a> ) converted Al-Azhar to a <a>Shafi'ite</a> <a>Sunni</a> center of learning.
<a>Abd-el-latif</a> delivered <a>lecture</a>s on <a>Islamic medicine</a> at Al-Azhar, while <a>Maimonides</a> delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin.</p>
<p>In 1961, Al-Azhar was established as a university under the government of Egypt's second President <a>Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> when a wide range of secular faculties were added for the first time, such as <a>economics</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>agriculture</a>.
Before that date, the <a>Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> classifies the Al-Azhar variously as madrasa, center of higher learning and, since the 19th century, religious university, but not as a university in the full sense, referring to the modern transition process as &quot;from madrasa to university&quot;.
An Islamic women's faculty was also added in the same year, six years after <a>Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah</a> had been the first woman to speak at the university..</p>
<h2>Magazine publishing</h2>
<p>Since 1929, Al-Azhar has published a magazine (now monthly) whose stated mission is to publicise religious rules, subjects related to Islamic literature, and basic jurisprudence <em>(<a>Fiqh</a>)</em>, including sections on history, biographies, translated texts, and news concerning the Muslim world.</p>
<h2>Political views</h2>
<p>[[Image:Al Azhar, Egypt.jpg|thumb|300px|Al-Azhar,
photo of the old Mosque.&lt;br
/&gt;[[Cairo]], <a>Egypt</a>]] <a>Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy</a>, the former Imam of Al-Azhar, declared that the perpetrators of the <a>9/11 attacks</a> and suicide bombers to be &quot;heretics&quot; who are deviating from the true path of <a>Islam</a>.
At a conference in <a>Indonesia</a>, he called on all &quot;true believers&quot; to deny proponents of extremist and heretical forms of Islam the opportunity to give speeches in mosques, with a view to preventing the spread of violent ideologies.</p>
<p><a>Ali Goma'a</a>, the Egyptian <a>Mufti</a> associated with Al-Azhar, has also declared that Islam authorizes the thwarting and eradication of those who kidnap and kill civilians in <a>Iraq</a> since they wreak havoc on Earth.</p>
<p>Sheikh Tantawy noted that among the priorities of Muslims are &quot;to master all knowledge of the world and the hereafter, not least the technology of modern weapons to strengthen and defend the community and faith&quot;.
He added that &quot;mastery over modern weaponry is important to prepare for any eventuality or prejudices of the others, although Islam is a religion of peace.&quot;.</p>
<p>Sheikh Tantawy also reasserted that his is the best faith to follow (a tenet common to proponents of many religions) and that Muslims have the duty of active <em>da'wa</em>.
He has made declarations about Muslims interacting with non-Muslims who are not a threat to Muslims.
There are non-Muslims living apart from Muslims and who are not enemies of Islam (&quot;Muslims are allowed to undertake exchanges of interests with these non-Muslims so long as these ties do not tarnish the image of the faith&quot;), and there are &quot;the non-Muslims who live in the same country as the Muslims in cooperation and on friendly terms, and are not enemies of the faith&quot; (&quot;in this case, their rights and responsibilities are the same as the Muslims so long as they do not become enemies of Islam&quot;).
However, Shi'a <a>fiqh</a> (according to a fatwa by Al-Azhar, the most respected authority in Sunni Islam) is accepted as a fifth <a>school of Islamic thought</a>.</p>
<h3>On freedom of speech</h3>
<p>In October 2007, <a>Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy</a>, then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, drew allegations of stifling freedom of speech when he asked the Egyptian government to toughen its rules and punishments against journalists.
During a Friday sermon in the presence of Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and a number of ministers, Tantawy is alleged to have stated that journalism which contributes to the spread of false rumours rather than true news deserves to be boycotted, and that it is tantamount to sinning for readers to purchase such newspapers.
Tantawy, a supporter of Egyptian President <a>Hosni Mubarak</a>, also called for a punishment of eighty lashes to &quot;those who spread rumors&quot; in an indictment of speculation by journalists over Mubarak's ill health and possible death.
This is not the first time that he has criticized the Egyptian press regarding its news coverage nor is it the first time he in return has been accused by the press of opposing freedom of speech.
During a religious celebration in the same month, Tantawy released comments alluding to &quot;the arrogant and the pretenders who accuse others with the ugliest vice and unsubstantiated charges&quot;.
In response, Egypt's press union issued a statement suggesting that Tantawy appeared to be involved in inciting and escalating a campaign against journalists and freedom of the press.</p>
