<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on March 5, 1839 as the Farmville Female Seminary Association, Longwood University is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States and one the <a>oldest public institutions of higher education for women in the United States</a>.
The Farmville Female College was incorporated in 1860 as the increasing prosperity of the seminary led the stockholders to expand it into a college.
Longwood is the third oldest public institution of higher learning in Virginia, after the <a>College of William and Mary</a> and the <a>University of Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>On April 7, 1884, the state of Virginia acquired the property of the Farmville Female College, and in October of the same year the Normal School opened with 110 students enrolled, making it the first state institution of higher learning for women in Virginia.
The Normal School expanded its curriculum over the years and progressed through a succession of names.
It became the State Normal School for Women in 1914, the State Teachers College at Farmville in 1924, and Longwood College in 1949.
In 1954, graduate programs were authorized.
Longwood became fully coeducational in June 1976.</p>
<p>On April 24, 2001 a main university building, Ruffner Hall, caught on fire and burned down despite the efforts of multiple local fire departments including the <a>Farmville fire department</a>.
It was in the middle of a renovation and was subsequently rebuilt.
Ruffner Hall, built in 1839 as the &quot;College Building&quot;, had evolved through several stages of construction and expansion from 1839 to 1907.
For decades the sprawling Ruffner, whose image appears on the university's logo and seal, was the main administration building, with administrative offices on the first floor and student housing on the upper two floors.
After students vacated the building by the early 1970s, dorm rooms were converted to office and classroom space.
The former library, Lancaster Hall, was renovated and reopened in 1996 as the main administration building.
Ruffner was then used primarily for classrooms and faculty offices before being closed in 1999 for renovation.</p>
<p><a>Governor Mark Warner</a> officially signed legislation changing Longwood's designation to university on April 24, 2002, the one-year anniversary of the fire that destroyed Ruffner Hall.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2010, Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan officially became the 25th president of Longwood University.
Finnegan previously served as the dean of the Academic Board at the <a>United States Military Academy</a>.
He replaced <a>Patricia Cormier</a>, who had been the president of Longwood since 1996.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Longwood sits on approximately  near downtown <a>Farmville</a>, <a>Virginia</a>.
Although a single campus, architecturally speaking the grounds are separated into two distinct areas: the historic &#x201c;north core&#x201d; and the more modern south end.</p>
<p>The oldest part of campus stretches along High Street from French dormitory to Grainger Hall.
These six red-brick Jeffersonian buildings (French, Tabb (Being Renovated to serve as athletic offices in the future), South Tabb (Offline and slated for demolition in the future) and South Ruffner dormitories, and Grainger, Ruffner, and Blackwell Halls) date from the 1830s to the 1920s  and are joined by a covered colonnade and all bear the university&#x2019;s signature red roofs.
At the center of this complex is Longwood&#x2019;s main building, Ruffner Hall.
The College of Arts and Sciences and recently the university&#x2019;s athletic offices, are located in along this section of campus.
To the western end of the north core is the administration building, Lancaster, as well as Jarman Theatre and the recently completed Chichester Science Center.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|150px|Longwood University from the entrance to Wheeler Residence Hall</a> Surrounding the main campus walk, Brock Commons, are the College of Business and Economics in Hiner Building, as well as the Cunninghams dormitories, the Dorrill Dining Hall and Lankford Building, the student union.
At the south end of campus are the library, music and arts buildings, and the Hull Education Center.
Several athletic complexes and dormitories surround the perimeter of the campus.</p>
<h3>New Construction</h3>
<p>Construction has been completed on a new Communications and Theater building.
The $11.9 million dollar new theater building features a 75 seat flexible black box theatre, a 100 seat studio theatre, 4 multi-function classrooms, a costume lab, a rehearsal studio, traditional drafting lab and a computer design lab.</p>
<p>The new Health and Fitness Center opened on August 28, 2007.
The  facility,  features a wide range of amenities including an indoor track, basketball and racquetball courts, a climbing wall, work-out rooms, juice bar, and the latest weight, exercise and training equipment.</p>
<p>Across Main Street, a new retail/student housing complex made of four four-story buildings arranged in an <a>pedestrian mall</a>-type setting, called &quot;Longwood Landings,&quot; was completed in the fall of 2006.</p>
<p>A new athletic training facility is currently under construction and is due to be completed by the spring semester.</p>
<p>Bedford Hall, the Art building on campus is currently being renovated.
The $30 million project is expected to be completed in 2011.</p>

</p>
<h2>Hazing</h2>
<p>In 2001, the <a>Pi Kappa Phi</a> fraternity had its charter revoked due to <a>hazing</a> allegations.
The national organization and Longwood allowed for <a>Pi Kappa Phi</a> to come back as an associate chapter in 2008.</p>

<h2>Joan of Arc</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|175px|<em>Jeanne d'Arc</em> in Longwood University's Ruffner Hall</a></p>
<p>Unique among public American universities is Longwood&#x2019;s adoption of a patron saint.
Saint Joan of Arc is said to both protect and inspire Longwood students.
The University&#x2019;s two prized depictions of Joan are &#x201c;Jeanne d&#x2019;Arc,&#x201d;&#x2014;known affectionately as &#x201c;Joanie on the Stony&quot;&#x2014;an 1870 plaster statue created by French sculptor <a>Henri-Michel-Antoine Chapu</a> and <a>Anna Hyatt Huntington</a>'s 1915 bronze <em>Joan of Arc</em> equestrian statue, nicknamed &#x201c;Joanie on the Pony.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Rituals and myths dealing with the two statues abound.
Joanie on the Stony, for example, heralds the occasion of every CHI walk with a pair of mysteriously appearing blue and white carnations.
Joanie on the Stony is also said to bring good luck for tests to students who touch her clasped hands on their way to class.</p>
<p>Joanie on the Pony, however, with her knight's armor and sword, acts as Longwood&#x2019;s protector.
On the night of the Great Fire of 2001, Joanie turned bright red upon her horse from the intense heat of the flames.
Although the fire spread west-ward, engulfing Grainger Hall along with Ruffner, the connected student dorms past Joanie to the east remained untouched&#x2014;the fire stopped directly before her.</p>
<p>In October 2009, Joanie on the Pony was vandalized.
After being restored, she was placed in Ruffner Hall in April 2010.</p>
<h2>The Dos Passos Prize</h2>
