<p> <strong>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</strong>, or <strong>RPI</strong>, is a <a>private</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Troy</a>, <a>New York</a>, <a>United States</a>.
It was founded in 1824 by <a>Stephen Van Rensselaer</a> for the &quot;application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;, and is the oldest technological university in the English-speaking world.
Built on a hillside, RPI's  campus overlooks the historic city of Troy and the <a>Hudson River</a> and is a blend of traditional and modern architecture.
The institute operates an on-campus business incubator and the  <a>Rensselaer Technology Park</a>, and is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace.</p>
<p>RPI's mission has slowly evolved over the years while retaining a focus on the scientific and technological roots upon which it was founded.
Over the past century, RPI has grown into a university with 5 schools: The School of Architecture, The School of Engineering, The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, The School of Science, and the <a>Lally School of Management &amp; Technology</a>.
All together, the university offers around 140 degree programs in 60 fields leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.
RPI consistently ranks in the top 50 among US universities for overall academics and among the top 50 worldwide for technology.
Adopted by the Board of Trustees in 1995, RPI's current mission is to &quot;educate the leaders of tomorrow for technologically based careers.
We celebrate discovery, and the responsible application of technology, to create knowledge and global prosperity.&quot;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1824-1900</h3>
<p></p>
<p><a>Stephen Van Rensselaer</a> established the Rensselaer School on November 5, 1824 with a letter to the <a>Rev.
Dr. Samuel Blatchford</a>, in which van Rensselaer asked Blatchford to serve as the first president.
Within the letter he set down several orders of business.
He appointed <a>Amos Eaton</a> as the school's first senior professor and appointed the first board of trustees.
On December 29 of that year, the president and the board met and established the methods of instruction, which were rather different from methods employed at other colleges at the time.
Students spent six hours a day performing experiments and explaining their rationale and gave their own lectures rather than listening to lectures and watching demonstrations.
Tuition was around $40 a semester.
The opening was announced by a notice, signed by the president, and printed in the Troy <em>Sentinel</em> on December 28.
The school attracted students from New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
The fact that the school attracted students from afar is attributed to the reputation of Eaton.
Fourteen months of successful trial led to the incorporation of the school on March 21, 1826 by the State of New York.
In its early years, the Rensselaer School resembled a graduate school more than it did a college.
It drew graduates of older institutions such as <a>Amherst</a>, <a>Bowdoin</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Penn</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Union</a>, <a>Wesleyan</a>, <a>Williams</a>, and <a>Yale</a>.
Indeed, there was a considerable stream from Yale, where there were several teachers interested in the sciences.
During this period, the Rensselaer School, renamed the Rensselaer Institute in 1832, was a small but vital center for technological research.
The first Civil Engineering degrees in the United States were granted by the school in 1835, and many of the best remembered civil engineers of that time graduated from the school.
Important visiting scholars included <a>Joseph Henry</a>, who had previously studied under <a>Amos Eaton</a>, and <a>Thomas Davenport</a>, who sold the world's first working <a>electric motor</a> to the institute.
In 1847, alumnus <a>Benjamin Franklin Greene</a> became the new senior professor.
Earlier he had done a thorough study of European technical schools to see how Rensselaer could be improved.
In 1850 he reorganized the school into a three-year polytechnic institute with six technical schools.
In 1861 the name was changed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>The severe conflagration of May 10, 1862, known as &quot;The Great Fire&quot; destroyed over 507 buildings in Troy and gutted  in the heart of the city.
The &quot;Infant School&quot; building that housed the Institute at the time was destroyed in this fire.
<a>Columbia University</a> proposed that Rensselaer leave Troy altogether and merge with its New York City campus.
Ultimately, the proposal was rejected and the campus left the crowded downtown for the hillside which offered potential for expansion.
Classes were temporarily held at the Vail House and in the <a>Troy University</a> building until 1864, when the Institute moved to a building on Broadway on 8th Street, now the site of the Approach.
Named President in 1901, Ricketts liberalized the curriculum by adding the Department of Arts, Science, and Business Administration, in addition to the Graduate School.
He also expanded the university&#x2019;s resources and developed RPI into a true polytechnic institute by increasing the number of degrees offered from two to twelve; these included electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, chemistry, and physics.
During Rickett's tenure, enrollment increased from approximately 200 in 1900 to a high of 1700 in 1930.
This arrangement was used by students until new freshman residence halls were opened in 1953.
The new dorm complex, affectionately called &quot;Freshman Hill&quot;, was subsequently expanded with the Commons Dining Hall in 1954, two more halls in 1958, and three more in 1968, just in time for the <a>baby boomers</a>.
The year 1961 saw major progress in academics at the institute with the construction of the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator, then the most powerful in the world, and the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center.
In addition to new academic buildings, the growing student body also needed a larger Student Union, which was finished in 1967.
The next three decades brought continued growth with many new buildings (see '<a>Campus'</a> below).
It was during these years that the university began to become proactive in helping businesses.
In 1980, several researchers and graduate students who wished to start a company approached the administration and asked for a place to set up a small lab.
The administration provided them with a basement in an old engineering building.
Two weeks later, another start-up company made a similar request.
It was at this point that the &quot;H-building&quot;, which had previously been used for storage, became the home for the RPI incubator program, the first such program sponsored solely by a university.
Shortly after this, RPI decided to invest $3 million in pavement, water and power on around  of land it owned  south of campus.
However, the program has persisted, and remains an integral part of life at RPI, with many courses requiring that a student bring their laptop to class.
1999 also saw the arrival of President <a>Shirley Ann Jackson</a>.
A graduate of <a>MIT</a>,  Jackson had held physics research positions at <a>Bell Laboratories</a> and <a>Rutgers University</a>, and had most recently served as chairperson for the <a>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>.
She instituted the &quot;<a>The Rensselaer Plan</a>&quot; (discussed below), an ambitious plan to revitalize the institute.
Many advances have been made under the plan, and Jackson has enjoyed the ongoing support of the RPI Board of Trustees.
However, her leadership style did not sit well with many faculty; on April 26, 2006, RPI faculty voted 149 to 155 in a failed vote of no-confidence in Jackson.
In August 2007, Jackson's administration disbanded the faculty senate and called for a full review of faculty governance, prompting a strong reaction from the Rensselaer community, including faculty petitions against the measure and a faculty hosted &quot;teach in&quot;.</p>
<p>On October 4, 2008, RPI celebrated the grand opening of the $220 million <a>Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center</a>.
About two months later, President Jackson announced via email that there would be Institute-wide layoffs due to &quot;the global and national economic crisis, and its impact on endowments.&quot;
On December 16, 2008, RPI eliminated 98 positions across the Institute, about five percent of its workforce.</p>
<p>Having nearly two centuries of history and a high tech future in store, the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> remarks, &#x201c;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is simultaneously the oldest technological school in the country and the most modern school of technology in the U.S. It&#x2019;s like George Jetson meets Archimedes.&#x201d;</p>
<h3>Firsts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1824 - The institute is founded and eventually becomes the first continually existing technological university in the English-speaking world.</li>
<li>1864 - The Alpha (first national) chapter of <a>Theta Xi</a> fraternity opens at RPI.</li>
  <li>1898 - The first <a>association</a> of <a>Latin American</a> students in the United States was formed at RPI, called the Union Hispano-Americana.
This organization would later merge with other like-minded organizations and form the first Latin American <a>fraternity</a> in the United States, <a>Phi Iota Alpha</a>, in 1931.</li>
<li>1909 - Alumni of <a>Pittsburgh</a> provide funds for the Pittsburgh Building.
This was the first time in American history that the alumni of a single city raised enough money to build a building on a college campus.</li>
<li>1961-  The institute awarded the first accredited <a>environmental engineering</a> degree in the United States.</li>
<li>1980 - The institute founds the first business incubator wholly sponsored and operated by a university.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>RPI's  landscaped campus sits upon a hill overlooking historic Troy, New York and the <a>Hudson River</a>.
The surrounding area is mostly residential neighborhoods, with the city of Troy lying at the base of the hill.
The campus is bisected by 15th Street, with most of the athletic and housing facilities to the east, and the academic buildings to the west.
An iconic footbridge spans the street, linking the two halves.
Much of the campus features a series of <a>Colonial Revival style</a> structures built in the first three decades of the 20th century.
Overall, the campus has enjoyed four periods of expansion:</p>
<h4>Ricketts Campus, 1906&#x2013;1935</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|Russell Sage Laboratory</a> President Palmer Ricketts supervised the construction of the school's &quot;Green Rooftop&quot; Colonial Revival buildings that give much of the campus a distinct architectural style.
Buildings constructed during this period include the <a>Carnegie Building</a> (1906), Walker Laboratory (1907), Russell Sage Laboratory (1909), Pittsburgh Building (1912), Quadrangle Dormitories (1916&#x2013;1927), Troy Building (1925), <a>Amos Eaton Hall</a> (1928), <a>Greene Building</a> (1931) and Ricketts Building (1935).
Also built during this period was &quot;The Approach&quot; (1907), a massive ornate granite staircase found on the west end of campus.
Originally linking RPI to the Troy Union Railroad station, it again serves as an important link between the city and the university.</p>
<h4>Post-War Expansion, 1946&#x2013;1960</h4>
<p>[[Image:WestHallRPIPano.jpg|thumb|right|[[West
Hall (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)|West Hall]]]] [[Image:VorheesComputingCenter.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Alan M. Voorhees|Voorhees]] Computing Center]] After <a>World War II</a>, the campus again underwent major expansion.
Nine dormitories were built at the east edge of campus bordering Burdett Avenue, a location which came to be called &quot;Freshman Hill.&quot;
The <a>Houston Field House</a> (1949) was reassembled, after being moved in pieces from its original <a>Rhode Island</a> location.
<a>West Hall</a>, which was originally built in 1869 as a hospital, was acquired by the Institute in 1953.
The ornate building is an example of <a>French Second Empire</a> architecture.
It was listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973.
Another unique building is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC).
Originally built as St. Joseph&#x2019;s Seminary chapel in 1933,it was once the institute's library, until the completion of the <a>Folsom Library</a> in 1976.
Interestingly, the new library, built adjacent to the computing center, was designed to match colors with the church, but is very dissimilar architecturally; it is an excellent example of the modern <a>brutalist</a> style &#x2013; a style that has invited comparisons with a <a>parking garage</a>.
The university was unsure of what to do with the church, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 the institute decided to preserve it and renovate it into a unique place for computer labs and facilities to support the institute's computing initiatives and today serves as the backbone for the institute's data and telephony infrastructure.</p>
<h4>Modern Campus, 1961&#x2013;present</h4>
<p>[[File:BiotechCenterRPI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies]]]] [[File:EMPACTwilight.JPG|thumb|right|[[Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center|EMPAC]]]] The modern campus features the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center (J-ROWL) (1961), Materials Research Center (MRC) (1965), Rensselaer Union (1967), Cogswell Laboratory (1971), Darrin Communications Center (DCC) (1973), <a>Jonsson Engineering Center</a> (JEC) (1977), <a>Low Center for Industrial Innovation</a> (CII) (1987), a public school building which was converted into Academy Hall (1990), and the <a>Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies</a> (2004).</p>
<p>On October 4, 2008, the university celebrated the grand opening of the <a>Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center</a> (EMPAC) situated on the west edge of campus.
The building was constructed on the precipice of the hill, with the main entrance on top.
Upon entering, elevated walkways lead into a 1,200 seat concert hall.
Most of the building is encased in a glass exoskeleton, with an atrium-like space between it and the &quot;inner building&quot;.
Adjacent to and underneath the main auditorium there is a 400 seat theater, offices, and three studios with  to  ceilings.</p>
<p>In October 2007, tentative plans were announced by President Jackson for a major addition to the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center, which would add  to  of lab space.
Design mock-ups showed a new adjacent building built next to the Science Center, with a glass-enclosed atrium spanning the space between the old building and the new.
The plans were further elaborated on by Jackson at the 2008 Town Meeting.
It was announced that under the plan the <a>Hirsch Observatory</a> would be renovated as well.
Vice President Claude Rounds said the budget had not been worked out in full but the project should cost somewhere between $70 to $75 million.
It houses about 300 students in 148 rooms and includes a fitness center, dining hall, and conference area.
RPI also owns the <a>Proctor's Theater</a> building in Troy which was purchased in 2004, with the intention of converting it into office space.
Due to the historic nature of the building, there was resistance by the Troy community and RPI has not done any redevelopment.
Advocates are hoping to restore the building back to its original use.</p>
<h3>Other Campuses</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Institute runs a  campus in <a>Hartford, Connecticut</a> and a distance learning center in <a>Groton, Connecticut</a>.
These centers are used by graduates and working professionals and are managed by the Hartford branch of RPI, <a>Rensselaer at Hartford</a>.
At Hartford, graduate degrees are offered in <a>Business Administration</a>, <a>Management</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, <a>Computer and Systems Engineering</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, Engineering Science, <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>, and <a>Information Technology</a>.
There are also a number of certificate programs and skills training programs for working professionals.</p>
<p>RPI also has a location in <a>Malta, New York</a> for graduates of the Navy Nuclear Power Training School (NNPTS) who work at the <a>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</a>'s (KAPL) <a>Kesselring</a> Site Operation in nearby <a>West Milton</a>.
Faculty from the Troy campus provide the teaching.
Students enter with one year's worth of coursework and in two to three years graduate with a BS in Nuclear Engineering, Engineering Physics, or Engineering Science.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Academy Hall</a> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has five schools: the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, the <a>Lally School of Management &amp; Technology</a>, and the School of Science.
The School of Engineering is the largest by enrollment, followed by the School of Science, the School of Management, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and the School of Architecture.
There also exists an interdisciplinary program in <a>Information Technology</a> that began in the late 1990s, programs in prehealth and prelaw, <a>Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> (ROTC) for students desiring commissions as officers in the armed forces, a program in <a>Cooperative Education</a> (Co-Op), and domestic and international exchange programs.
All together, the university offers around 140 degree programs in nearly 60 fields that lead to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.
In addition to traditional majors, RPI has around a dozen special interdisciplinary programs, such as Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences (GSAS), &#x0009; Design, Innovation, and Society (DIS), Minds &amp; Machines, and Product Design and Innovation (PDI).
RPI is a technology-oriented university; all buildings and residence hall rooms have hard-wired high speed internet access, most of the campus buildings have wireless, and all incoming freshmen have been required to have a laptop computer since 1999.
In 2004, <a>Forbes</a> ranked RPI #1 for having the &quot;most connected campus.&quot;
Nationally, RPI is a member of the <a>National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a> (NAICU) and the NAICU's <a>University and College Accountability Network</a> (U-CAN).</p>
<h3>Rensselaer Plan</h3>
<p>[[File:RPIPano.jpg|thumb|350px|View of RPI from [[Central Troy Historic District|downtown Troy]]]] With the arrival of the current president, <a>Dr.
Shirley Ann Jackson</a>, came the &quot;Rensselaer Plan&quot; announced in 1999.
Its goal is to achieve greater prominence for RPI as a technological research university.
Various aspects of the plan include bringing in a larger <a>graduate student</a> population and new research faculty, and increasing participation in undergraduate research, international exchange programs, and &quot;living and learning communities.&quot;
Financially speaking, the plan uses half its money for <a>research</a>, a quarter for scholarships, and a quarter for campus platforms, such as athletic facilities.
So far, there have been a number of changes under the plan: new infrastructure such as the <a>Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies</a> and <a>Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations</a> (CCNI) was built to support new programs, and application numbers have increased.
In fact, in the three years between 2005 and 2008 application numbers doubled from 5,500 to 11,000.
According to <a>Jared Cohon</a>, president of <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a> &#x201c;Change at Rensselaer in the last five years has occurred with a scope and swiftness that may be without precedent in the recent history of American higher education.&#x201d;
Although the number of doctoral students has increased,  These pages show a decrease from 1839 in 1999 to 1228 in 2007, a decrease of 36% (Hartford students were not included in the 1999 figure).</p>
<p>The ability to attract greater research funds is needed to meet the goals of the plan, and the university has set a goal of $100 million annually.
As of 2006, research expenditures have reached $90 million per annum.
The university recognizes the relatively small size of its <a>endowment</a> compared to its competition (cf.
Case Western Reserve U., University of Rochester, etc.).
To help raise money the university mounted a $1 billion capital campaign, of which the public phase began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008.
In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360 million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S. university at the time.
The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15 million.
By September 2006, the $1 billion goal has been exceeded much in part to an in-kind contribution of software commercially-valued at $513.95 million by the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE).
In light of this, the board of trustees announced a new goal of $1.4 billion by June 30, 2009.
The new goal was met by October 1, 2008.</p>
<h3>Faculty</h3>
<p>The number of faculty has been steadily growing since the implementation of the Rensselaer Plan in 1999.
As of 2006 there are 400 full time and 81 part time faculty, yielding a student faculty ratio of 14:1.</li>
<li><a>Leik Myrabo</a> - known for designing and testing laser &quot;lightcraft&quot; propulsion systems</li>
  <li><a>Pauline Oliveros</a> - musician and composer of electronic art music</li>
  <li><a>Robert Resnick</a> - textbook author and physics professor emeritus</li>
  <li><a>Sal Restivo</a> - pioneering researcher in the ethnography of science and social studies of mathematics; founding member and former president of the Society for Social Studies of Science</li>
  <li><a>Neil Rolnick</a> - former head of the Arts Department, and founder of iEAR studios</li>
  <li><a>Michael Shur</a>- well-published <a>solid state electronics</a> researcher</li>

<h2>Research and development</h2>
<p>[[Image:LowCenterRPI.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Low Center for Industrial Innovation]]]] RPI has established six areas of research as institute priorities: <a>biotechnology</a>, <a>energy and the environment</a>, <a>nanotechnology</a>, <a>computation and information technology</a>, and <a>media and the arts</a>.
Advances in these fields have the potential to effect dramatic transformations in 21st century society.</p>
<p>RPI is home to the United States' first on-campus business incubator, One of the largest companies to have originated in the incubator is <a>MapInfo</a>, a major publisher of mapping and geographic information systems software.
Others incubator success stories include <a>Vicarious Visions</a>, a well known maker of video games, and CORESense, Inc., a leading provider of multi-channel retail software.
RPI operates the <a>Rensselaer Technology Park</a>, which is home to over 50 technologically oriented companies.
The  park is about  south of the campus along the Hudson River.
Park tenants collaborate with faculty and students on research projects and hire students for internships, co-ops, and employment.</p>
<p>Some notable research centers operated by RPI are the Terahertz Research Center, <a>Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies</a>, Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center, New York State Center for Polymer Synthesis, Darrin Fresh Water Institute, Center for Automation Technologies and Systems, and the Lighting Research Center.
The Lighting Research Center (LRC) is the leading university-based research center devoted to lighting, offering the world's only M.S. degree in lighting.
Since 1988 it has built an international reputation as a reliable source for objective information about lighting technologies, applications, and products.
The LRC provides training programs for government agencies, utilities, contractors, lighting designers, and other lighting professionals.</p>
<p>RPI conducts nuclear research at the 60MeV Gaerttner <a>Linear Accelerator</a> (LINAC) Laboratory.
The LINAC is used primarily for the testing of materials, but there is also ongoing research in <a>neutron generation</a> and other technologies.

Other important research facilities include the geotechnical centrifuge, used for civil engineering simulations, and RPI's array of six subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic <a>wind tunnel</a>s.</p>
<p>In May 2006, RPI announced a partnership with IBM and New York State to create the <a>Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations</a>, a supercomputing center to be used for nanotechnology research.
As of June 2008, the $100 million center is North America's most powerful university-based supercomputing center and the 22nd most powerful supercomputing center of any kind in the world.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|RPI's &quot;Quad&quot; dormitory on the central campus</a> In the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year, RPI's enrollment included 5,534 resident undergraduate, 1,055 resident graduate, 722 graduate students on the Hartford campus and 71 distance learning graduate students.
The institute attracts students from every state and 92 foreign countries.
Among class of 2013, 61% were in the top 10% of their high school class.
The yield rate (percentage of admitted students who attend) was 27.3% in 2008.</p>
<p>Around 17% of students received the RPI medal/scholarship in high school, which is a merit scholarship of $15,000 a year.
Altogether about 90% of students receive either need-based or merit-based financial aid.</p>
<h3>Gender ratio</h3>
<p>Since becoming coeducational in 1942, RPI has struggled to attract a gender-balanced applicant pool.
In 1966 the male-to-female ratio was 19:1, in the 1980s it reached as high as 8:1, and in the early 1990s the ratio was around 5:1.
As of 2009 RPI has a ratio of 2.5:1 (72% male / 28% female), which is among the highest of major American universities.
Both the class of 2011 and the class of 2012 have a ratio of about 2.3:1, or about 30% female.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|RPI Athletics logo</a>   The <strong>RPI Engineers</strong> are the athletic teams for the university.
RPI currently sponsors 23 sports, 21 of which compete at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> level in the <a>Liberty League</a>, men's and women's ice hockey compete at the <a>Division I</a> level in <a>ECAC Hockey</a>.
The official nickname of some of the school's Division III teams was changed in 1995 from the Engineers to the Red Hawks.
However the hockey, football, cross-country, tennis, and track and field teams all chose to retain the Engineers name.
The Red Hawks name was, at the time, very unpopular among the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted with thrown concessions and chants of &quot;kill the chicken!&quot;
In contrast, the official hockey mascot known as The Puckman has always been very popular.
The Puckman is an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer's helmet.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 80s, one RPI cheer was: :<em>E to the x, dy/dx, E to the x, dx</em> :<em>Cosine, secant, tangent, sine</em> :<em>3.14159</em>
:<em>Square root, cube root, log of pi</em> :<em>Disintegrate them, RPI!</em></p>
<h3>Ice hockey (men's)</h3>
<p><a>thumb|150px|The Puckman Mascot</a> The school features a competitive <a>Division I</a> <a>ice hockey</a> team, the Engineers, who won <a>NCAA</a> national titles in 1954 and 1985.
Depending on how the rules are interpreted, the RPI men's ice hockey team may have the longest winning streak on record for a Division I team; in the 1984-85 season it went undefeated for 30 games, but one game was against the <a>University of Toronto</a>, a non-NCAA team.
Continuing into the 1985-86 season, RPI continued undefeated over 38 games, including two wins over Toronto.
<a>Adam Oates</a> and <a>Daren Puppa</a>, two players during that time, both went on to become stars in the NHL.
<a>Joe Juneau</a>, who played from 1987 to 1991, also spent many years in the NHL.
<a>Graeme Townshend</a> who also played in the late 1980s, had a brief NHL career.
He is the first person of <a>Jamaican</a> ancestry to play in the <a>National Hockey League</a>.</p>
<p>The hockey team plays a significant role in the campus's culture, drawing thousands of fans each week to the <a>Houston Field House</a> during the season.
The team's popularity even sparked the tradition of the hockey line, where students lined up for season tickets months in advance of the on-sale date.
Today, the line generally begins a week or more before ticket sales.
Another tradition since 1978 has been the &quot;Big Red Freakout!&quot; game held close to the first weekend of February.
Fans usually dress in the schools colors Red and White, and gifts such as tee-shirts are distributed en masse.
In hockey the school's biggest rival has always been the upstate engineering school <a>Clarkson University</a>.</p>
<h3>Ice hockey (women's)</h3>
<p>The women's ice hockey team moved to the NCAA Division I level in 2005.
During the 2008-09 season the team set the record for most wins in one season (19-14-4).
On February 28, 2010, Rensselaer made NCAA history.
The Engineers beat Quinnipiac, 2-1, but it took five overtimes.
It is now the longest college hockey game in NCAA history.
Senior defenseman Laura Gersten had the game winning goal.
She registered it at 4:32 of the fifth overtime session to not only clinch the win, but the series victory.</p>
<h3>Lacrosse (men's)</h3>
<p>The lacrosse team won the <a>national championship</a> in 1952.
The lacrosse team also represented the United States in the <a>1948 Olympics</a> in London.
<a>Ned Harkness</a> coached the lacrosse and ice hockey teams, winning national championships in both sports.</p>
<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p>The Red Hawk baseball squad is perennially atop the Liberty League standings, winning the league title in 2008 with the help of Liberty League Pitcher of the year Joe Zongol.
The team is coached by ex-New York Yankee Karl Steffen (Ithaca '78) with Steve &quot;Smoke&quot; Allard (Massachusetts '87) as Associate Head Coach.
The Red Hawks play their home games at Robison Field.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Since 1903 RPI and nearby Union College have been rivals in football, making it the oldest such rivalry in the state.
The teams play for the <a>Dutchman's Shoes</a>.
The 2008 Engineers look to compete for a National Championship.
As defending Liberty League Champions they have the target on their back but look to return to the NCAA playoffs.
RPI Football had their most successful season in 2003, where they finished 11-2 and lost to St. Johns (Minn.) in the NCAA Division III semi final game.</p>
<h3>Athletic facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Houston Field House</a> <a>thumb|300px|East Campus Athletic Village, under construction</a>  The Houston Field House is a 4,780-seat multi-purpose arena located on the RPI campus.
It opened in 1949 and is home to the RPI Engineers men's and women's ice hockey teams.
The Field House was recently renovated starting in 2007 as part of the major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village.
The renovations included locker rooms upgrades, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness.
Additionally, as part of the renovations, solar panels were added installed on the roof to supply power to the building through a government grant.</p>
<p>As part of the Rensselaer Plan, the institute recently completed a major project to improve its athletic facilities with the East Campus Athletic Village.
The plan included construction of a new and much larger 4,842 seat football stadium, a basketball arena with seating for 1,200, a new 50-meter pool, an indoor track and field complex, new tennis courts, new weight rooms and a new sports medicine center.
The institute broke ground on August 26, 2007 and construction of the first phase is expected to last two years.
The estimated cost of the project is $78 million for phase one and $35&#x2013;$45 million for phase two.
Since the completion of the new stadium, the bleachers on the Class of '86 football field on the central campus have been removed and the field has become an open space.
In the future the new space could be used for expansions of the academic buildings, but for now members of the campus planning team foresee a &quot;historic landscape with different paths and access ways for students and vehicles alike&quot;.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|Student Union</a> The students of RPI have created and participate in a variety of student-run clubs and organizations funded by the Student Union.
The Union is unusual in that it is entirely student-run and its operations are paid for by activity fees.
About 170 of these organizations are funded by the Student Union, while another thirty, which consist mostly of political and religious organizations, are self-supporting.
In 2006 the <em>Princeton Review</em> ranked RPI second for &quot;more to do on campus.&quot;</p>
<p>Phalanx is RPI's Senior Honor Society.
It was founded in 1912, when Edward Dion and the Student Council organized a society to recognize those RPI students who have distinguished themselves among their peers in the areas of leadership, service, and devotion to the alma mater.
It is a fellowship of the most active in student activities and has inducted over 1300 members since its founding.</p>
<p>Greek organizations are popular with about 30 social fraternities and 5 sororities.
There are two coed fraternities, <a>Psi Upsilon</a>, a social fraternity, while the other, <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, is a <a>service fraternity</a>.
As such, about a third of men are in fraternities and about a fifth of women are in sororities.
See the <a>List of RPI fraternities and sororities</a>.</p>
<p>RPI has around twenty intramural sports organizations, many of which are broken down into different divisions based on level of play.
Greek organizations compete in them as well as independents.
There are also thirty-nine club sports.</p>
<p>Given the university's proximity to the Berkshires, Green Mountains, and Adirondacks, the Ski Club and the Outing Club are some of the largest groups on campus.
The Ski Club offers weekly trips to local ski areas during the winter months, while the Outing Club offers trips on a weekly basis for a variety of activities.</p>
<p><em><a>The Rensselaer Polytechnic</a></em> is the student-run weekly school newspaper.
<em>The Poly</em> prints about 7000 copies each week, and distributes them around campus.
Although it is the Union club with the largest budget, <em>The Poly</em> receives no subsidy from the Union, and obtains all funding through the sale of ads.
There is also a popular student-run magazine called <em>Statler &amp; Waldorf</em>.
Another popular source of news is the student-run <a>RPInsider.com</a>.</p>
<p>RPI has an improvisational comedy group, Sheer Idiocy, which performs several shows a semester, as well as a sketch comedy troupe, Experimental Error.
There are also several music groups ranging from <a>a cappella</a> groups such as the Rensselyrics, the Rusty Pipes, Partial Credit and Duly Noted, to several instrumental groups such as the Orchestra, the Jazz Band, and a classical choral group, the Rensselaer Concert Choir.</p>
<p>Another notable organization on campus is <a>WRPI</a>, the campus radio station.
WRPI differs from most <a>college radio</a> in that it serves a  radius including the greater <a>Albany</a> area.
With 10&nbsp;kW of broadcasting power, WRPI maintains a stronger signal than nearly all college radio stations and some commercial stations.
WRPI currently broadcasts on 91.5 FM in the Albany area.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The RPI Playhouse</a> The RPI Players is an on-campus theater group that was formed in 1929.
The Players resided in the Old Gym until 1965 when they moved to their present location at the 15th Street Lounge.
This distinctive red shingled building had been a USO hall for the US Army before being purchased by RPI.
The Players have staged over 260 productions in its history.</p>
<h3>RPI songs</h3>
<p> There are a number of songs commonly played and sung at various RPI events.
Notable among them are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Alma Mater (Here's to Old RPI)</em> - sung at formal events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>, also played and sung by the <a>Pep Band</a> at hockey and football games.
It was published in the first book of <em>Songs of Rensselaer</em> printed in 1913.</li>
<li><em>Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer</em> - used to be the <a>fight song</a> during the 1960s.
It is still played today by the Pep Band at athletic events.</li>
<li><em>All We've Learned at Rensselaer</em> - sung at the RPI commencement ceremonies by the Rensselyrics.
Although the Rensselyrics are an <a>a cappella</a> group, this song is accompanied by piano.
Each verse or section has a different musical style, several of which are closely based on <a>Billy Joel</a> songs or other popular songs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>First Year Experience and CLASS Programs</h3>
<p>Another notable aspect of student life at RPI is the &quot;First-Year Experience&quot;, or FYE program.
Freshman begin their stay at RPI with a week called &quot;Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond&quot; or NRB week.
The Office of the First-Year Experience provides several programs that extend to not only freshman, but to all students.
These include family weekend, community service days, the Information and Personal Assistance Center (IPAC), and the Community Advocate Program.
Recently the FYE  program was awarded the 2006 NASPA Excellence Gold Award, in the category of &quot;Enrollment Management, Orientation, Parents, First-Year, Other-Year and related.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 2008, Dr. Jackson's administration has led an effort to form the CLASS Initiative (&quot;Clustered Learning Advocacy and Support for Students&quot;), which requires all sophomores to live on campus and to live with special &quot;residence cluster deans&quot;.
The transition to this program began in early 2010 among some resistance from fraternities and students who had planned to live off campus.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
