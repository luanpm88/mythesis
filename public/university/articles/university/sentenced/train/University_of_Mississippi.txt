<p>The <strong>University of Mississippi</strong>, also known as <strong>Ole Miss</strong>, is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducational</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Oxford</a>, <a>Mississippi</a>.
Founded in 1848, the school is composed of the main campus in Oxford, four branch campuses located in <a>Booneville</a>, <a>Grenada</a>, <a>Tupelo</a>, and <a>Southaven</a> as well as the <strong><a>University of Mississippi Medical Center</a></strong> in <a>Jackson</a>.
It also operates the University of Mississippi Field Station in <a>Abbeville</a>.
Additionally, it is both a <a>sea-grant</a> and <a>space-grant</a> institute.
Sixty-nine percent of undergraduates are from Mississippi, and nineteen percent of all students are minorities.
International students come from sixty-six nations.</p>

<p>As a way to find a name for the book, a contest was held to solicit any suggestions from the student body.
Elma Meek, a student at the time, submitted the winning entry of Ole Miss.
This sobriquet was chosen not only for the yearbook, but also became the name by which the University is now known.</p>
<p>The Lyceum, built in 1848, is the oldest building on campus.
In its first year, it housed all of the classrooms and faculty offices of the university.
The Lyceum is now the home of the university's administration offices.
The columned facade of the Lyceum is represented on the official crest of the university, along with the date of establishment.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine, which was originally located at the eastern gate of the campus, was used as a hospital during the <a>Civil War</a> for both <a>Union</a> and <a>Confederate</a> soldiers, especially those who were wounded at the <a>battle of Shiloh</a>.
Soldiers who died in the campus hospital were buried in a mass grave located at the northeast corner of the Coliseum which was built nearly 100 years later as a venue for concerts and basketball games.
The School of Medicine, then providing the first two years of pre-clinical education and granting medical certificates, was moved to the western edge of campus into Billy S Guyton Hall in 1934.
After the medical school moved to the new University Hospital in Jackson, Guyton Hall housed the ROTC units.
After a complete renovation in 2005 it currently houses the School of Education.
</p>
<p>The School of Medicine is now located in Jackson, Mississippi.
The original building, renamed Brady Hall in honor of a former head nurse, served first as a dormitory for male students, and then as the home of the Music Department in its last years before being condemned in the early 1970s.
It was replaced by a new Chemistry building in the mid 1970s.
</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, classes were interrupted when the entire student body and many faculty from Ole Miss enlisted in the Confederate army.
Their company, Company A, 11th Mississippi Infantry, was nicknamed the <em><a>University Grays</a></em>, and suffered a 100% casualty rate during the Civil War.
A great number of those casualties occurred during <a>Pickett's Charge</a> at the <a>Battle of Gettysburg</a> on July 3, 1863, when the University Grays made the deepest encroachment into Union territory.
Some of the soldiers actually crossed the Union defensive fortification wall, only to be killed, wounded or captured.
On the very next day, July 4, Confederate forces <a>surrendered</a> at <a>Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>; the two battles together are commonly viewed as the turning point in the war.
When Ole Miss re-opened, only one member of the University Grays was able to visit the university to address the student body.
The university was led, during the post-war period, by former Confederate <a>general</a> <a>A.P. Stewart</a>, a <a>Rogersville, Tennessee</a> native, who was <a>President</a> from 1874-1886.</p>
<p>During the 1930s, an attempt by <a>Mississippi Governor</a> <a>Theodore G. Bilbo</a> to move the University of Mississippi to <a>Jackson</a>, was prevented by then Chancellor <a>Alfred Hume</a> by giving Mississippi legislators a grand tour of Ole Miss and the surrounding city of Oxford.
It so impressed the legislators that the move was defeated.</p>
<h3>Desegregation</h3>
<p></p>
<p><a>Desegregation</a> came to Ole Miss in the early 1960s with the activities of <a>United States Air Force</a> veteran <a>James Meredith</a> from <a>Kosciusko, Mississippi</a>.
Even Meredith's initial efforts required great courage.
All involved knew how violently Dr. <a>William David McCain</a> and the white political establishment of Mississippi had recently reacted to similar efforts by <a>Clyde Kennard</a> to enroll at Mississippi Southern College (now the <a>University of Southern Mississippi</a>).</p>
<p>Meredith won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962.
He attempted to enter campus on September 20, September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi Governor <a>Ross R. Barnett</a>, who proclaimed that &quot;...No school in our state will be integrated while I am your Governor.
I shall do everything in my power to prevent integration in our schools.&quot;</p>
<p>After the <a>United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor <a>Paul B. Johnson, Jr.</a> in contempt with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of <a>U.S. Marshals</a>, entered the campus on September 30, 1962.</p>
<p>The enrollment of Meredith led to an anti-<a>desegregation</a> riot.
Thousands of students, citizens from the surrounding area and many from out of state, many armed, were involved.There was a sense among a certain class of white Mississippi males that this was their battle against 'Catholic, Communist, Northern' intervention in Mississippi white people's business.
The protesters swarmed the campus in a violent effort to prevent Meredith's enrollment, and thus save a part of the segregationist policies of Mississippi at the time.</p>
<p>Two people died during the riot.
Meredith, thanks to the protection afforded by federal marshals, was able to enroll and attend his first class on October 2. Following the <a>riot</a>, elements of an <a>Army National Guard</a> division were stationed in Oxford to prevent future similar violence.
While most Ole Miss students did not riot prior to his official enrollment in the university, many harassed Meredith during his first two semesters on campus.</p>
<p>According to first person accounts chronicled in Nadine Cohodas's book <em>The Band Played Dixie</em>, students living in Meredith's dorm bounced basketballs on the floor just above his room through all hours of the night.
When Meredith walked into the cafeteria for meals, the students eating would all turn their backs.
If Meredith sat at a table with other students, all of whom were white, the students would immediately get up and go to another table.</p>
<p>The site of these riots, known as the <a>Lyceum-The Circle Historic District</a>, was designated as a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> by the <a>United States Secretary of the Interior</a> on October 7, 2008.
The district includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Lyceum</li>
  <li>The Circle</li>
  <li><a>Croft Institute for International Studies</a>, also known as the &quot;Y&quot; Building</li>
  <li>Old Chemistry Building</li>
  <li>Carrier Hall</li>
  <li>Shoemaker Hall</li>
  <li>Ventress Hall</li>
  <li>Bryant Hall</li>
  <li>Peabody Hall</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, on April 14, 2010, the University campus was declared a National Historic Site by the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> to honor reporters who covered the 1962 riot.
One of the two people killed during the riot was a <a>French</a> reporter named <a>Paul Guihard</a>.</p>
<h3>Presidential debate</h3>
<p>The  <a>University</a> was chosen to host the <a>first presidential debate of 2008</a>, which was held September 26, 2008.
This was the first ever presidential debate to be held in Mississippi.

<h3>Mascot Change</h3>
<p>The University of Mississippi is currently undergoing a process to adopt a new on-field mascot for athletic events.
The university has not used an on-field mascot since 2003, when Colonel Reb was removed from the sidelines by the administration.
The mascot issue has been a source of controversy since this change.
Some students and alumni found the Old South imagery conjured by Colonel Reb to be offensive, while many others cherished Colonel Reb as a representation of regional pride and the perfect example of the Southern gentleman.
In the spring of 2010, students at the university were asked to vote, &quot;Do you want to be part of the mascot selection process?&quot;  23% of students voted &quot;Yes&quot; to this question.
On October 14, 2010, the mascot-selection process ended with the committee submitting &quot;Rebel Black Bear&quot; concept to the university administration.
The university administration then turned over the concept to the athletic department for further development before official implementation.
Regardless of the official on-field mascot fielded by the university, all the university's sports teams will still be referred to as the Rebels.
Students are less than enthusiastic about the new mascot.

<ul>
  <li><em><a>The Daily Mississippian</a></em> is the student-published newspaper of The University, established in 1937.
Although The Daily Mississippian (DM) is located on the Ole Miss campus, it is operated largely as an independent newspaper run by students.
The DM is the only college newspaper in <a>Mississippi</a> that is published five times a week.
The editorial staff consists of approximately 15 students, along with a staff of 15-20 writers and 5 photographers, though these numbers vary from year to year and semester to semester.
There is also an entire department devoted entirely to advertising sales and production.
With a circulation of 15,000, it is one of the largest college newspapers in the country.</li>
<li><em>The Ole Miss</em> student yearbook is a 416-page color book produced by students with faculty advice.
It has won various awards including the Gold Crown.</li>

<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> [[Image:Olemissspeedlimit.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Archie Manning]]'s uniform number as the official speed limit on campus.]]
<a>Archie Manning</a>'s uniform number, 18, has become the official speed limit of the Oxford campus.</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p>Approximately 4,386 students live on campus in the fourteen residence halls available.
All freshmen (students with less than 30 credit hours) are required to live in campus housing their first year unless they meet certain commuter guidelines.
The Department of Student Housing and Residence Life is an auxiliary, meaning that it is self-supporting and does not receive appropriations from state funds.
All rent received from students pays for housing functions such as utilities, staff salaries, furniture, supplies, repairs, renovations and new buildings.
Most of the residence staff members are students, including day-to-day management, conduct board members and maintenance personnel.
Upon acceptance to The University of Mississippi, a housing application is submitted with a processing fee.
Delta Kappa Epsilon followed shortly after at Ole Miss in 1850, as the first to have a house on campus.
Delta Gamma national sorority was founded in 1873 at the Lewis School for Girls in nearby Oxford.
Today, sorority chapters are very large, with many boasting of around 250 active members.
Recruitment is fiercely competitive and potential sorority members are encouraged to secure personal recommendations from Ole Miss sorority alumnae in order to increase the chances of receiving an invitation to join one of the 9 NPC sororities on campus.
