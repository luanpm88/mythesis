<p>NSU was founded in 1884 as the <strong>Louisiana State Normal School</strong> to train teachers.
It was the first school in Louisiana to offer degree programs in nursing and business education.
NSU, along with numerous other state colleges, gained university status in 1970 during the administration of President <a>Arnold R. Kilpatrick</a>, a Northwestern alumnus who served from 1966-1978.
Kilpatrick succeeded the 12-year president, <a>John S. Kyser</a>, a native of <a>El Paso</a>, <a>Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>NSU was one of the first six colleges to enter into <a>NASA</a>'s <a>Joint Venture Program</a> (&quot;JOVE&quot;).
Students worked with NASA scientists to help analyze data and do research for the 1996 <a>Space Shuttle Columbia</a> shuttle mission.</p>
<p>NSU also hosts Louisiana's designated honors college in the liberal arts and sciences, called the <a>Louisiana Scholars' College</a>.
The <a>Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts</a>, a state supported residential high school for sophomores, juniors and seniors, is also located on the campus.
It was a brainchild of former <a>State Representative</a> <a>Jimmy D. Long</a> of Natchitoches, who also attended NSU.</p>
<p>NSU currently offers more than 50 degree programs and complete accreditation of all of its accreditable degree programs.
Fall 2005 total enrollment was 9,847, a decline from Fall 2004's record enrollment of 10,546 that university administrators said was due to the application and enforcement of new admissions standards.
NSU also claims more than 70,000 alumni.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Northwestern State University stands on ground that has been dedicated to learning for well over a hundred years.
Prior to the <a>American Civil War</a>, a portion of the present campus was the property of the Bullard family of Natchitoches.
As early as 1856, the Bullard mansion was in use as a convent by the Religious Society of the Sacred Heart.
The following year a school building was erected at the <a>convent</a> and in 1884 the town and parish of Natchitoches purchased the property.
Three of the four great white columns that once supported the east gable of the mansion still stand on &#x201c;The Hill&#x201d; and serve as the unofficial symbols of the university.
The campus, developed upon rolling hills and high river bottomland, is acknowledged to be one of the most spacious and attractive in the South.
The natural beauty of the site drew people to it even in prehistoric times.
Long the home of a major Indian tribe for which it was named, the French fortified Natchitoches in 1714 as an outpost of their New World Empire facing Spanish <a>Texas</a> to the west.</p>
<p>In 1884, the <a>Louisiana State Legislature</a> by Act 51 created the Louisiana State Normal School for the preparation of teachers.
Shortly thereafter, a freshman member of the <a>Louisiana House of Representatives</a>, <a>Leopold Caspari</a> of Natchitoches, offered the convent site as a campus for the school with the anticipated approval of the citizens of Natchitoches.
The offer was accepted, and from 1885 to 1918 the Normal School offered two years of study for the training of teachers.
Baccalaureate programs were inaugurated, and the Louisiana Constitutiofn of 1921, changed the name of the school to Louisiana State Normal College.
The resources and curricula of &quot;Normal&quot; grew steadily to meet the increasingly diverse requirements of Louisiana&#x2019;s expanding population.
In 1944, the institution&#x2019;s excellent service in its broader role was accorded formal recognition by Act 326 of the Legislature, which changed its name to Northwestern State College of Louisiana.</p>
<p>Northwestern maintained and strengthened its long tradition of leadership in public service and academic endeavor and became, in 1954, the first college under the jurisdiction of the Louisiana State Board of Education to offer the Master&#x2019;s degree.
The Specialist in Education degree was first offered in 1966 and the Doctor of Philosophy in Education degrees were authorized in 1967.
On June 18, 1970, Governor <a>John J. McKeithen</a> signed a legislative act that brought the old campus its greatest distinction, changing its title to Northwestern State University of Louisiana.
In 1980, the old campus quadrangle where the columns stand was entered into the National Register of Historic Places under the title &#x201c;Normal Hill Historic District.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Although primarily a regional institution, Northwestern also offers an opportunity for education at other satellite locations, including <a>Leesville</a>, <a>Shreveport</a>, and <a>Alexandria</a>.
In addition to academics, these centers are also developing student life programs.
The Nursing Education Center, located in Shreveport, provides the educational environment for nursing majors enrolled in clinical courses as well as general education courses.
The Center houses departments administering masters, baccalaureate and associate degree programs.
The campus includes state-of-the-art academic facilities, office space for faculty and staff, a bookstore, and facilities for activities and organizations.
<a>Excerpt from University Student Handbook</a></p>
<p><a>A.A. Fredericks</a> was president of NSU from 1934-1941.
He was later a member of the <a>Louisiana State Senate</a> and the private secretary on two occasions to <a>Governor</a> <a>Earl Kemp Long</a>.
Fredericks obtained his teaching credentials from Northwestern &quot;Normal&quot; in 1912.
The A.A. Fredericks Auditorium on campus commemorates his memory.
</p>
<p><a>Eugene P. Watson</a> of Natchitoches, for whom the NSU library is named, was head <a>librarian</a> and professor of <a>library science</a> from 1940 until his death in 1964.
He founded <a>Alpha Beta Alpha</a>, the national library science fraternity.
The group held its first biennial convention on the NSU campus in 1952.</p>
<p>The <a>centennial</a> history of NSU (1884&#x2013;1984) was published by the NSU Press in 1985 by the  <a>historian</a> <a>Marietta LeBreton</a>, who taught forty-five years at the institution, from 1963 until her sudden death in 2009.</p>
<h3>The Legend of Isabella</h3>
<p>Isabella was a young French maiden, renowned for her beauty, who once lived in the original Bullard mansion after the Bullards were gone.
The young lady had many suitors but preferred the company of a young man from the East, sent to Louisiana on business.
They fell in love and were to be married.
Shortly before the wedding date arrived, the young man was killed in a duel.
Legend has it that the duel concerned a dispute over another woman.</p>
<p>Isabella, overcome by grief, became a nun, and the French maiden&#x2019;s beauty wasted away through constant mourning of her intended.
Everyone believed she had gone mad from grief and mourning.
One stormy night she ended her mourning by plunging a dagger into her heart.
Soon after she was found dead in her room, with a bloody handprint on the wall.</p>
<p>Her spirit roamed Bullard mansion until it was torn down.
Since then she has roamed various buildings on campus.
She lived in East Hall until it was torn down in 1926.
This was evidenced by the eyewitness accounts of girls who lived in East Hall.
From there, Isabella's spirit moved to the Music Hall and resided there until 1948 then that building was also torn down.
Just before the Music Hall was dismantled, a group of young men, dressed in sheets, coaxed Isabella from the doomed building.</p>
<p>From there she wandered aimlessly around campus from building to building (including East Varnado) for almost three years, until, becoming weary, she chose Caldwell Hall as her next residence.
Speculation has it that Caldwell was chosen because of its close proximity to the original Bullard dwelling.
According to newspaper articles, the official date of the move was January 15, 1949.
Reportedly a letter from the ghost was found on the steps of Caldwell along with a few drops of blood.</p>
<p>Isabella's current residence is the Old Women&#x2019;s Gym located on College Avenue beside Varnado Hall.
When Caldwell Hall burned in October 1982, a group of 750 students gathered and performed a ceremony on Halloween night that aided Isabella in her transition to her present location.</p>
<h3>Vic the Demon</h3>
<p>On November 8, 1922, by proclamation of President V. L. Roy and Coach H. Lee Prather, all athletic teams became known as the Demons.
The name was decided upon by a contest open to all students with a grand prize of $10.
A committee was appointed by the President to narrow down the names submitted by the student body.
The final selection was decided by a vote of the students.
The two most popular choices were Braves and Demons.
Among other names submitted by students were Sharks, Daredevils, Musketeers, Pelicans, Prather&#x2019;s Ground Hogs, Bloodhounds, Cyclops and Serpents.
The official winners were Aileen Ritter and Truett Scarborough.</p>
<p>On September 22, 1984, the Demon received his official given name by means of another contest sponsored by the Athletic Department.
The contest was open to faculty, staff, and students.
The objective: to find a name for the Demon.
Over 300 entries were submitted to the committee.
The grand prize was an all expense paid weekend at the Louisiana State Fair Classic.
Ray Carney, an alumnus of the university, was the official winner with &quot;Vic,&quot; which is short for &quot;Victory&quot;.</p>
<h3>Jim Croce</h3>
<p><a>Singer-songwriter</a> <a>Jim Croce</a> died in a plane crash hours after finishing a 1973 concert on the NSU campus.</p>
<h2>Student media</h2>
<p>Its student-run weekly <a>newspaper</a>, <em>The Current Sauce</em>, was founded in 1914.
Its annual student-run yearbook is called <em>The Potpourri</em>.
There is also a student-run <a>radio</a> station, KNWD &quot;The Demon&quot; 91.7FM, and a faculty-administrated and student-operated local television station, NSU22, on which can be found daily student-produced newscasts.</p>
<p>NSU's literary magazine is called <em>The Argus</em>.
It is student-run and published during the spring semester.

<h2>Lady of the Bracelet pageant</h2>
<p>The <strong>Lady of the Bracelet</strong> pageant (commonly referred to as LOB) is a long-standing competition which scholarships are awarded to female students.
The first place winner of the pageant is awarded the title of &quot;Lady of the Bracelet&quot; for one year.
</p>
<p>The program is under the direction of the Director of Student Activities and the Assistant Director of Student Activities of Northwestern State University.
Contestants compete in several categories including interview, evening wear, and swimsuit competition.
In addition to being bestowed the title of &quot;Lady of the Bracelet&quot; for the following year, the first place contestant receives a full scholarship and goes on to compete in the <a>Miss Louisiana</a> pageant, which can ultimately result in a berth to the <a>Miss America</a> pageant.
It is traditionally held during on the first Friday in February.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s, the Potpourri, Northwestern&#x2019;s yearbook, sponsored the first beauty pageant held on the university campus.
The contestants were selected from photographs submitted to well-known producers for judgment and were chosen for their charm and beauty.
In 1958, Miss Kahne Dipola was crowned the first Miss Lady of the Bracelet and she received a gold bracelet to wear when she represented the university in public.
Over the years, the bracelet has been passed down to each holder of the title.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of Mr. Robert W. Wilson, Sr., the Student Union Governing Board purchased the first franchise from the Miss Louisiana Pageant in 1971, enabling Northwestern&#x2019;s Lady of the Bracelet to enter the state contest.
The Student Activities Board, formerly the Student Union Governing Board, has continued the tradition of sponsoring the Lady of the Bracelet Pageant for the enjoyment of the Northwestern community.
The Lady of the Bracelet pageant has gained state recognition for production, scholarship, and quality of contestants.</p>
<p>The current Lady of the Bracelet is Carly McCord.</p>
<h2>ROTC Program</h2>
<p>With an agreement signed between Northwestern State College and the Department of the United States Army,  an anti-aircraft field artillery unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps was established in the  fall of 1950.
In August 1950, the building to house the ROTC unit was authorized.
The new military science program, under President Prather, enrolled its first students in the fall of 1950 with one officer and five enlisted men on the staff.
By the end of the 1950-51 academic year 220 men had selected military training and the future of the program looked promising.
In 1965, NSC under President Kyser signed an agreement with the department of Army stating that the Military Science Senior ROTC program would be provided with a university secretary, armory, and utilities.
The NSU ROTC Department and the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana mutually support Cadet Command by identifying quality soldiers with officer potential and in assisting them in transition from active duty under the college ROTC Green to Gold program.
The NSU ROTC Demon Battalion has commissioned nearly 1000 Second Lieutenants in to the United States Armed Services.
Quite a few graduates have become distinguished Army Officers, including several General Officers.
A Hall of Fame was begun in 1983.
Portraits and biographies of the Hall of Fame members are on permanent display in the ROTC office foyer .
NSU ROTC cadets have been selected to attend specialty schools in Germany and at West Point.
Cadets have also participated in ceremonies commemorating the Bataan March in New Mexico, and supporting the Habitat for Humanity and Loggers Conventions.
During the past two years, several renovation projects have been completed.
The cadets have been able to enjoy a TV lounge, kitchen area and game room to include a billiards, ping pong  and foosball.
Notably, five NSU ROTC commissioned officers have been inducted into NSU&#x2019;s highest Hall of Distinction, the Long Purple Line.</p>
