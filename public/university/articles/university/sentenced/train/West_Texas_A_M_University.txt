<p><strong>West Texas A&amp;M University</strong> (also known as <strong>WTAMU</strong>, <strong>WT</strong>, and formerly <strong>West Texas State</strong>), part of the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>, is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Canyon</a>, <a>Texas</a>, a small <a>city</a> south of <a>Amarillo</a>.
West Texas A&amp;M opened on September 20, 1910.
West Texas A&amp;M University was originally called West Texas State <a>Normal College</a> and started out as one of the seven state-funded <a>teacher college</a>s.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the first school year, West Texas State Normal College had 152 students and 16 faculty members.
Its first president was Robert B. Cousins.
A year after the <a>Texas State House of Representatives</a> approved the bill to establish West Texas State Normal College, construction began on the school's Administration Building.
It consisted of the school's only classrooms, laboratory, library, and offices.
On March 25, 1914, the school burned down; however, classes continued in local churches, courthouses, and vacant buildings.
Later, in 1916, a new Administration Building opened.</p>
<p>The first four-year college degrees were granted in 1919.
In the following years the college was admitted to: American Association of Teachers Colleges in 1922, Association of Texas Colleges in 1923, and Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1925.
The school changed its name to West Texas State Teachers College in 1923.
In the early 1930s, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society built its <a>Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum</a> on the campus.
</p>
<p>In 1948, a nonconformist leftist <a>sociology</a> professor, <a>Joseph L. Duflot</a> (1881&#x2013;1957), created a sensation on campus when he told a meeting of the <a>American Federation of Labor</a> in Amarillo that &quot;modern capitalism&quot; is the &quot;No.
1 enemy of the United States economy.&quot;
A powerful legislator at the time, Sam Hanna of <a>Dallas County</a>, warned that state funding could be jeopardized for any college with &quot;a communist&quot; on the faculty.
Though the West Texas regents first dismissed Duflot, he survived a second vote, and regent H.L. Mills praised him for &quot;the courage of his convictions&quot;.</p>
<p>Many returning veterans from <a>World War II</a> enrolled at the institution in the latter 1940s, taking advantage of new <a>G.I. Bill of Rights</a> assistance.
Conditions were so overcrowded for a time that the former soldiers slept in the <a>gym</a>nasium, and beds were brought from a former <a>Prisoner of War</a> camp in <a>Hereford</a>.
Subsequently, Pickens donated $165 million to <a>Oklahoma State University-Stillwater</a>.  In 2007, Pickens endowed the &quot;Pickens Professorship of Business&quot; and in 2010 he endowed the &quot;Pickens Professorship of Management.&quot;
The business school as a whole remains unnamed.</p>
<p>In 1986, WT President Ed Roach was the subject of protests and calls for his resignation over the amount of money spent on the campus' Presidential House.
The  house cost $991,000, which was more than the $494,900 authorized by the State College Coordinating Board.
In 1991, Roach was indicted for diverting scholarship money to meet other budget deficits.</p>
<p>The university joined the Texas A&amp;M University System on September 1, 1990, and started to use the name West Texas A&amp;M University in 1993.
The school's first president under the new system was Barry B. Thompson.
Early in Thompson's tenure, he dropped the school's <a>football</a> program, but the program returned a year later without athletic scholarships.</p>
<p>President Thompson was appointed Chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University System in 1994 and Russell C. Long became the new president.
During Long's tenure, the school renovated buildings, maintained its student enrollment growth, and added its first <a>Ph.D.</a> in agriculture.
</p>
<p>In late 2005, Long retired from his position as the school's president, and J. Patrick O&#x2019;Brien took that office.
As of 2006, West Texas A&amp;M University has approximately 7,000 students.
The university contains over 60 <a>undergraduate</a>-<a>degree</a> programs, 40 <a>graduate</a>-degree programs, and one <a>doctoral</a> program</p>
