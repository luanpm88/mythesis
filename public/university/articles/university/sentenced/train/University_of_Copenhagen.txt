<p>The <strong>University of Copenhagen</strong> () is the oldest and largest <a>university</a> and research institution in <a>Denmark</a>.
Founded in 1479, it has more than 37,000 <a>student</a>s, the majority of whom are female (59%), and more than 7,000 employees.
The university has several <a>campus</a>es located in and around Copenhagen, with the oldest located in central Copenhagen.
Most courses are taught in Danish; however, many courses are also offered in English and a few in German.
The university has 2800 foreign students of which about half are from <a>Nordic countries</a>.</p>
<p>The university is a member of the <a>International Alliance of Research Universities</a> (IARU), along with <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>University of Oxford</a>, <a>Yale University</a>, <a>The Australian National University</a>, and <a>UC Berkeley</a>, amongst others.
The <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, compiled by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, sees Copenhagen as the leading university in <a>Scandinavia</a> and the 40th ranked university in the world in 2010.
The university is generally understood to be one of Europe's leading research institutions.
The university has had 9 alumni become Nobel laureates and 1 Turing award recipient.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>The university is governed by a board consisting of 11 members: 6 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 2 members are appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are  appointed by the university students.
The Rector is appointed by the university board.
The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments.
There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads.
Hence the university has no faculty governance.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p></em>[[Image:Copenhagen Rundet&#x00e5;rn street left.jpg|thumb|left|The
<em>[[Rundet&#x00e5;rn]]<em> (round tower) was used in the 17th century as an observatory by <a>Ole R&#x00f8;mer</a>.]]</em>
The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479 and is the oldest <a>university</a> in Denmark.
Between the closing of the <a>Studium Generale</a> in <a>Lund</a> in 1536 and the establishment of the <a>University of Aarhus</a> in the late 1920s, it was the only university in Denmark.
The university became a centre of <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>theological</a> learning, but also had faculties for the study of <a>law</a>, <a>medicine</a>, and <a>philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>The university was re-established in 1537 after the <a>Lutheran Reformation</a> and transformed into an <a>evangelical</a>-<a>Lutheran</a> <a>seminary</a>.
Between 1675 and 1788, the university introduced the concept of degree examinations.
An examination for <a>theology</a> was added in 1675, followed by law in 1736.
By 1788, all faculties required an examination before they would issue a degree.</p>
<p>In 1801, under the command of <a>Admiral Horatio Nelson</a>, the British fleet <a>bombarded</a> Copenhagen during the <a>Battle of Copenhagen</a>, destroying most of the university's buildings.
By 1836, however, the new main building of the university was inaugurated amid extensive building that continued until the end of the century.
The <a>university library</a>, the <a>Zoological Museum</a>, the <a>Geological Museum</a>, the <a>Botanic Garden</a> with <a>greenhouse</a>s, and the Technical College were also established during this period.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Interior of the old university library at <em>Fiolstr&#x00e6;de</em> around 1920.</a> Between 1842 and 1850, the faculties at the university were restructured.
Starting in 1842, the <a>University Faculty of Medicine</a> and the <a>Academy of Surgeons</a> merged to form the <a>Faculty of Medical Science</a>, while in 1848 the Faculty of Law was reorganised and became the <a>Faculty of Jurisprudence and Political Science</a>.
In 1850, the <a>Faculty of Mathematics and Science</a> was separated from the <a>Faculty of Philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>The first female student was enrolled at the university in 1877.
The university underwent explosive growth between 1960 and 1980.
The number of students rose from around 6,000 in 1960 to about 26,000 in 1980, with a correspondingly large growth in the number of employees.
Buildings built during this time period include the new Zoological Museum, the <a>Hans Christian &#x00d8;rsted</a> and August Krogh Institutes, the campus centre on <a>Amager Island</a>, and the <a>Panum Institute</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|300px|The Geological Museum.</a>
The new university statute instituted in 1970 involved <a>democratisation</a> of the management of the university.
It was modified in 1973 and subsequently applied to all <a>higher education</a> institutions in Denmark.
The democratisation was later reversed with the 2003 university reforms.
Further change in the structure of the university from 1990 to 1993 made a <a>Bachelor's degree</a> programme mandatory in virtually all subjects.</p>
<p>Also in 1993, the law departments broke off from the <a>Faculty of Social Sciences</a> to form a separate <a>Faculty of Law</a>.
In 1994, the University of Copenhagen designated <a>environmental studies</a>, north-south relations, and <a>biotechnology</a> as areas of special priority according to its new long-term plan.
Starting in 1996 and continuing to the present, the university planned new buildings, including for the <a>University of Copenhagen Faculty of Humanities</a> at <a>Amager</a> (&#x00d8;restaden), along with a Biotechnology Centre.
By 1999, the student population had grown to exceed 35,000, resulting in the university appointing additional professors and other personnel.
<a>thumb|left|300px|The Faculty of Humanities.</a></p>
<p>In 2003, the revised Danish university law removed faculty, staff and students from the university decision process, creating a top-down control structure that has been described as absolute monarchy, since leaders are granted extensive powers while being appointed exclusively by higher levels in the organization.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Center for Health and Society (Center for Sundhed og Samfund - CSS) opened in central Copenhagen, housing the Faculty of Social Sciences and Institute of Public Health, which until then had been located in various places throughout the city.
In May 2006, the university announced further plans to leave many of its old buildings in the inner city of <a>Copenhagen</a>, an area that has been home to the university for more than 500 years.
The purpose of this has been to gather the university's many departments and faculties on three larger campuses in order to create a bigger, more concentrated and modern student environment with better teaching facilities, as well as to save money on rent and maintenance of the old buildings.
The concentration of facilities on larger campuses also allows for more inter-disciplinary cooperation; for example, the Departments of Political Science and Sociology are now located in the same facilities at CSS and can pool resources more easily.</p>
<p>In January 2007, the University of Copenhagen merged with the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science.
The two universities are now faculties under the University of Copenhagen, and are now known as the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>
<h2>Student housing</h2>
<p>[[Image:Tietgenkollegiet.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tietgenkollegiet]].]]
Although many privately owned <a>dormitories</a> (<em>kollegier</em> in Danish) exist in <a>Copenhagen</a>, there are also five which are partially administered by the university.
Only students who have passed at least two years of studies are considered for <a>admission</a>.
These are normally referred to as the <em>old dormitories</em>, and they consist of <a>Regensen</a>, <a>Elers' Kollegium</a>, <a>Borchs Kollegium</a>, <a>Hassagers Kollegium</a>, and <a>Valkendorfs Kollegium</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to the tradition of most American dormitories, Danish dormitories in general, and the old dormitories in particular, only offer single rooms for rent, meaning no student has to share their room with others.
Many Danish students live in dormitories throughout their studies.</p>
<h2>The seal</h2>
<p>The oldest <a>seal</a> only exists on a letter from 1531 and it depicts <a>Saint Peter</a> with a key and a book.
In a circle around him is the text  When the university was re-established by <a>Christian III</a> in 1537 after the <a>Protestant Reformation</a>, it received a new seal.
The seal shows the king with <a>crown</a>, <a>sceptre</a>, and <a>globus cruciger</a> sitting above a <a>coat of arms</a> that contains the <a>Danish</a> coat of arms in the upper right part and the <a>Norwegian</a> coat in the left.
The text is  The 1537 seal is very similar to the current seal, shown at the top of this page.
The text is different and there is only the national coat of arms of Denmark on the seal.
The coat of arms has a crown and contains three lions and nine hearts.
The text is </p>
<p>In addition to the university seal, each of the university's eight faculties have a seal of their own.

<h2>International reputation</h2>
<p>The 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> published by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> ranks the University of Copenhagen as the best university in Denmark and Scandinavia, the 7th best university in Europe, and is #40 in Top 500 World Universities rankings.</p>
<p>On the 2009 <a>THE&#x2013;QS World University Rankings</a> list, the University of Copenhagen was ranked inside the top 100 for the sixth consecutive year.
In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> Copenhagen moved back into the top 50 at 45th.</p>
<p>The university cooperates with universities around the world.
In January 2006, the University of Copenhagen entered into a partnership of ten universities, along with the <a>Australian National University</a>, <a>ETH Z&#x00fc;rich</a>, <a>National University of Singapore</a>, <a>Peking University</a>, <a>University of California Berkeley</a>, <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>University of Oxford</a>, <a>University of Tokyo</a> and <a>Yale University</a>.
The partnership is referred to as the <a>International Alliance of Research Universities</a> (IARU)./nn20050712b2.htm</p>
