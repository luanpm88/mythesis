<p>The <strong>Victoria University of Manchester</strong> (commonly known as the <strong>University of Manchester</strong>) was a <a>university</a> in <a>Manchester</a>, <a>England</a>.
On 1 October 2004 it merged with the <a>University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> (UMIST) to form a new entity, &quot;<strong><a>The University of Manchester</a></strong>&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1851 - 1951</h3>
<p>The University was founded in 1851 as <em>Owens College</em>, named after <a>John Owens</a>, a textile merchant, who left a bequest of &#x00a3;96,942 for the purpose.
Its first accommodation was in Quay Street, Manchester, in a house which had been the residence of <a>Richard Cobden</a>.
In 1859, Owens College was approved as a provincial examination centre for matriculation candidates of the <a>University of London</a>.
As the college progressed it became inadequate so a move to <a>Chorlton on Medlock</a> was planned in 1871 and <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a> was the architect of the new college building west of Oxford Road which was opened in 1873.
It was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1880, becoming the first constituent college of the federal <a>Victoria University</a>.
In 1884, <a>University College Liverpool</a> joined the University, followed in 1887 by the <a>Yorkshire College</a> in <a>Leeds</a>.</p>
<p>In 1903, the college in Liverpool left the Victoria University to become the independent <a>University of Liverpool</a> and Leeds followed in 1904 to become the <a>University of Leeds</a>.
The remaining university and college were merged by Act of Parliament, 24 June 1904 (the Victoria University of Manchester was established by royal charter 15 July 1903).</p>
<h3>1951 - 2004</h3>
<p>In the mid 1960s the University and the Corporation commissioned Hugh Wilson &amp; Lewis Womersley to produce a new plan for the campus.
The final report was issued in 1966 and included removing traffic from Oxford Road to the adjacent main routes east and west and a building called the Precinct Centre which was subsequently constructed in 1970-72.
The Precinct Centre building includes the oldest part of the <a>Manchester Business School</a>, Devonshire House and Crawford House and the St Peter's House, the University Chaplaincy.
It stands on Booth Street East and Booth Street West and Oxford Road runs through it at ground level.
The architects were Wilson &amp; Womersley, in association with the University planning officer, H. Thomas; for St Peter's House the architects were Cruickshank &amp; Seward.</p>
<p>The University had over 18,000 full-time students (including 2500 international students from more than 120 countries) by the time it merged with UMIST.
It was regarded as one of the top universities in the country, frequently getting top ratings for research.</p>
<p>On 5 March 2003 it was announced that the University was to merge with <a>UMIST</a> on 1 October 2004, to form the largest conventional university in the UK, the <a>University of Manchester</a>, following which the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST would cease to exist.
The new University was inaugurated on 1 October 2004.</p>

<p>The chief officers of the University were the Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar, the Bursar and the <a>Librarian</a>.
In later years many administrative changes were made that increased the independence of the Director of Estates and Services, the Director of the Manchester Computing Centre, and eventually combined the offices of Registrar and Bursar as that of Registrar and Secretary, the last holder of this post being Eddie Newcomb (1995-2004).</p>

<p>Many famous or well-known people worked and studied at the Victoria University of Manchester: see <a>People associated with the University of Manchester</a> and <a>List of University of Manchester people</a>.</p>
<h2>Motto and arms</h2>
<p>The motto of the University was &quot;Arduus ad solem&quot;, meaning &quot;striving towards the sun&quot;.
It is a metaphor for aspiring to <a>enlightenment</a>.
It is quoted from <a>Virgil</a>'s <a>Aeneid</a> book VI, and the archives do not record the reasons for its choice.
The original verse refers to a serpent and the sun, both of which featured in the university <a>coat of arms</a>.
The serpent is traditionally associated with wisdom.
The arms were granted in October 1871 to Owens College while the Victoria University had arms of its own which fell into abeyance from 1904 upon the merger of the College with the University.
</p>
<p>The emblem of the University in use for a number of years (last used September 2004) was based on the archway into the quadrangle from Oxford Road where there used to be a set of coats of arms relating to the history of the component colleges on the gates.</p>
