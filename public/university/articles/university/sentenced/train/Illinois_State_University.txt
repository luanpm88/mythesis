<p><strong>Illinois State University</strong>, founded in 1857, is the oldest <a>public university</a> in <a>Illinois</a>; it is located in <a>Normal</a>.
Most commonly referred to as <strong>ISU</strong>, the school was founded by <a>Jesse W. Fell</a>, who had his friend, <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>, draw up the legal documents to establish the university.
The original name of the school was <em>Illinois State Normal University</em>, reflective of its primary mission as a teacher training institution (at that time called a <a>normal school</a>).
In 1964, as the institution began expanding and moving toward a full <a>liberal arts</a> curriculum, its name was changed, first to Illinois State University at Normal, and then by 1968 to Illinois State University.
The Town of Normal, originally named North Bloomington, took its name from the school.
</p>
<p>ISU is recognized in the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> rankings as a &quot;National University,&quot; that is, a university which grants a variety of doctoral degrees and strongly emphasizes <a>research</a>.
Among public universities in Illinois awarding doctorate degrees, only the <a>University of Illinois</a> ranks higher.
Illinois State University was most recently ranked the 95th best university by <a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</a> in the January 2011 issue.
It is also ranked as the 123&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; best university in the U.S. by the <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em>.
</p>
<p>The ISU <a>athletic teams</a> are members of the <a>Missouri Valley Conference</a> and the <a>Missouri Valley Football Conference</a> and are known as the &quot;Redbirds,&quot; in reference to the state bird, the <a>cardinal</a>.</p>
<p>Illinois State is also home to one of the world's tallest residence halls, <a>Watterson Towers</a>.
Standing just shy of , its massive capacity allows it to house over 2,200 students.
The building, which consists of a pair of towers, was completed in 1967.</p>
<h2>A Teaching School</h2>
<p>ISU is recognized as one of the top ten largest producers of <a>teacher</a>s in the US according to the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education.</p>
<p>In accordance with its mission, the school's motto was originally &quot;and gladly wold he lerne and gladly teche,&quot; in the Middle English spelling of <a>Geoffrey Chaucer</a>.
By the 1960s, the motto was spelled in the modern style, &quot;and gladly would he learn and gladly teach.&quot;
Despite the apparently gender-specific &quot;he&quot; in this motto, until the 1970s there were significantly more women than men attending the university.
The motto has since been updated to the gender-neutral form &quot;Gladly we Learn and Teach.&quot;</p>
<h2>Academics and Organizations</h2>
<p>Though originally a teachers' college, ISU has grown into a university offering a range of programs at the bachelor, master, and doctoral levels.</p>
<p>The English Department, the largest department at ISU, is unique in its interdisciplinary focus named &quot;<a>English Studies</a>&quot;, which includes various <a>literature</a> in <a>English</a>, <a>writing</a>/<a>composition</a> theories, <a>cultural studies</a>, <a>K-12</a> English <a>education</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>TESOL</a>, and so forth.
The Department also leads in the field of <a>children's literature</a> in the United States.
ISU's History Education program, housed in the History Department, is frequently cited as one of the leaders in that field.
Premised on the philosophy that future history teachers should learn their craft from historians, immersing themselves not just in content knowledge but in <a>historical method</a> too, the History Education program has served as a model for similar programs at other universities.
ISU also has a respected nursing school, the Mennonite College Of Nursing, and its Speech Pathology and Audiology programs and Special Education programs are strong.
The current president of Illinois State University, Clarence Alvin Bowman, Ph.D., is the former chairman and head of the Speech Pathology and Audiology Department.
It operates the Eckelmann-Taylor Speech and Hearing Clinic and a program that works with Metcalf Laboratory School and other area schools to train future therapists in providing services to schoolchildren at the graduate and postgraduate level.</p>
<p>ISU has its own student radio station, <a>WZND</a>.
On January 20, 2010 WZND changed its format from a dual format (Rock and Jamz) to a college shuffle format.
The station broadcasts on channels 4 &amp; 5 in the residence halls and on <a>the web</a>.</p>
<p>Illinois State University also boasts one of the largest student spirit organizations in the United States, <a>RED ALERT</a>.
This registered student organization has over 4,100 members, roughly one fourth of the student body.
The group was founded in 2006 to promote student involvement in university athletics and has grown exponentially.
</p>
<p>ISU is also the home of the <a>Gamma Phi Circus</a>, the oldest collegiate <a>circus</a> in the world, founded in 1929.
It is one of two collegiate circuses in the US; the other is run by <a>Florida State University</a>.</p>
<p>The university owns public radio station <a>WGLT</a> (&quot;News, Blues and All That Jazz&quot;), which broadcasts on 89.1 in Normal, 103.5 in <a>Peoria</a>, and by <a>streaming audio</a>.
The call letters are from keywords of the school's motto: &quot;Gladly-Learn-Teach.&quot;</p>
<p>TV-10, a part of the School of Communication, provides the only live local television newscast produced entirely in Bloomington-Normal.</p>
<p>The school publishes two newspapers, <em><a>The Daily Vidette</a></em> and <a><em>The Indy</em></a>, the latter being an alternative weekly publication.</p>
<p>The visual art education program has been a thriving presence in the related professional field.
The National Art Education Association (NAEA) Student Chapter received the national award for Outstanding Student Chapter in 2002 and again in 2003 and 2007&mdash;the only school to have received this award multiple times.
Many students have held the national position of NAEA Student Chapter President, as well as faculty holding national board positions.
The program has an extremely high job placement percentage.</p>
<p>ISU's Department of Politics and Government publishes a journal called <a>Critique</a>.</p>

<p>[[Image:Cookhall.JPG|thumb|left|[[John W. Cook Hall]]]] The Illinois State University campus quadrangle is compact compared with other large universities, with buildings spaced closely together around a rectangular center lawn.
</p>
<p>The quad is a popular site for dissemination of campus information including notifications of events or meetings that are taking place around campus.
In the beginning of the fall semester the Quad is host to Festival ISU, where campus organizations set up tables with games, prizes, and information about themselves to network their organizations.</p>
<p>Many activities take place on the quad as well, such as movies and concerts.
Lined with benches and shady trees, the site is also a popular spot for students to relax, study, and play informal games of football, soccer, beer bags, and capture the flag, among others.</p>
<h2>Milner Library</h2>
<p>The Milner Library contains a collection of more than 1.5 million volumes and an ever-increasing number of electronic materials accessible via the Internet to students and faculty.
The library's collection is distinguished by materials related to educational theory and policy, curriculum development, and issues related to special education and assistive technology.
The Special Collections include extensive Circus and Allied Arts materials and a children's literature collection that features more than 100 first edition volumes signed by author <a>Lois Lenski</a>.
Combined, Milner's collections contribute to the university's relatively high standing in regional, national, and world rankings.
In 2007, the library received the <a>John Cotton Dana</a> Library Public Relations Award, an award given to only seven libraries nationwide.
</p>
<p>Milner Library is also a selective federal depository for government information and administers the Illinois State University Archives, which host an Illinois Regional Archives Depository (IRAD) at an off-site location.
</p>
<p>Additional facilities include book storage both on and off-site as well as a fully staffed <a>preservation</a> department.
</p>
<p>The Milner Library was named for Angeline &#x201c;Ange&#x201d; Vernon Milner (1856&#x2013;1928), a Bloomington-Normal native and the first full-time librarian of Illinois State Normal University.
Milner is credited with organizing the university's initial collection of more than 40,000 items and was a prolific author of more than seventy articles and short monographs in library and education journals during her tenure as University Librarian from 1890 to 1927.
The current library building, the third in the university's history, opened in 1976.</p>
