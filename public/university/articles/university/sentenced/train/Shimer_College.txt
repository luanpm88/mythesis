<p> <strong>Shimer College</strong> (often shortened to <strong>Shimer</strong>;  ) is a very small, private, undergraduate <a>liberal arts</a> college in <a>Chicago</a>, Illinois, in the United States.
Founded by <a>Frances Wood Shimer</a> in 1853 in the frontier town of <a>Mt.
Carroll, Illinois</a>, it was a women's school for most of its first century.
It joined with the <a>University of Chicago</a> (U. of C.) in 1896, and became one of the first <a>junior college</a>s  in the country  in 1907.
In 1950, it became a co-educational four-year college, took the name Shimer College, and adopted the Hutchins Plan of Great Books and <a>Socratic</a> seminars then in practice at the U. of C. The U. of C. relationship ended in 1958.
Shimer enjoyed national recognition and strong growth in the 1960s but was forced by financial problems to abandon its campus in 1978.
The college then moved to an improvised campus in the Chicago suburb of <a>Waukegan</a>, remaining there until 2006, when it moved to the <a>campus</a> of the <a>Illinois Institute of Technology</a> (IIT) in the <a>Douglas</a> <a>community area</a> of Chicago.</p>
<p>Classes are exclusively small seminars in which students discuss original source material rather than read textbooks.
The core curriculum, a sequence of courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and <a>integrated studies</a>, makes up two thirds of the course work required for a degree.
Shimer has offered a <a>study abroad</a> program in <a>Oxford, England</a>, since 1963 and a Weekend Program for working adults since 1981.
Applicants to the school are evaluated on their academic potential, based primarily on an essay.
No minimum grades or test scores are required.
The <a>Early Entrant Program</a>, in place since 1950, allows students who have not yet completed high school to start college early.
Shimer has the highest rate of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college in the country.
Fifty percent of students go on to graduate study; twenty percent complete doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>Shimer resides on the IIT main campus, designed by <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>, which was added to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2005.
There, students maintain Shimer College traditions but also participate in IIT student life.
Shimer practices democratic self-governance to an extent that it states &quot;is rare among institutions of higher education&quot;.
Since 1977, the college has been governed internally by faculty, staff, and students working through a structure of committees and an egalitarian deliberative body called the Assembly.
Shimer enrolled 104 students in 2009.
The town persuaded two schoolteachers from <a>Ballston Spa, New York</a>, <a>Frances Wood</a> and her friend Cindarella Gregory, to come west to the prairie to teach, and on May 11, 1853, the new seminary opened with 11 students in a local church.
Failing to raise enough money locally, the incorporators borrowed enough money to construct a building in 1854; discouraged by the financial picture, however, they sold the school to Wood and Gregory, who borrowed the money to buy it.
<a>William Rainey Harper</a>, then president of the U. of C., was the first to champion the idea of the <a>Junior College</a> in the United States, and in 1907, Shimer became one of the first schools to offer a junior college program.
The two-year junior college program, which operated alongside the original preparatory program, was <a>accredited</a> in 1920.</p>
<p>The college suffered a severe decline in enrollment and subsequent financial hardship during and after the <a>Great Depression</a>, which it survived &#x2014; under five different presidents &#x2014; in part by reorganizing the six-year preparatory program into a four-year junior college program and in part through deep salary reductions.
In 1943, Shimer president Albin Bro invited the Department of Education at the U. of C. to evaluate the entire college community.
The 77 recommendations they returned would become the basis for Shimer's transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.</p>
<p>The school was renamed Shimer College in 1950, and adopted the <a>Great Books</a> curriculum then in place at the U. of C. In 1963 a <em><a>Harvard Educational Review</a></em> article named Shimer as one of 11 colleges with an &quot;ideal intellectual climate&quot;.
A 1966 article in the education journal <em><a>Phi Delta Kappa</a>n</em> reported that Shimer &quot;present[ed] impressive statistical evidence that their students are better prepared for graduate work in the arts and sciences and in the professions than those who have specialized in particular areas.&quot;
Three times in the next four years, the trustees voted to shut the school down, only to later vote to reopen it.
under the leadership of <a>Don Moon</a>, a nuclear engineer and Episcopal priest who had joined the faculty in 1967.
Accepting an invitation from the city of <a>Waukegan, Illinois</a>, a declining industrial suburb north of <a>Chicago</a>, the faculty and 62 students borrowed trucks and moved the college into two &quot;run down&quot; homes over Christmas break in 1978.
By 1988 enrollment had climbed from a low of 40 to 114 and income exceeded expenses.
Shimer won a grant from the <a>National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH) in 1991, with the help of then NEH chair and core-curriculum advocate <a>Lynne Cheney</a>; the grant helped the school raise <a>US$</a>2 million and revitalized fund raising.</p>
<p>In 2006, Shimer, again struggling with stagnating enrollment, accepted an invitation to move, this time to the campus of the <a>Illinois Institute of Technology</a> (IIT)  in Chicago, under a long-term lease agreement; the two institutions kept separate faculties and boards.
Students, organized under the name Shimer Student Alliance, protested at the February 2010 Board meeting.
Following votes of <a>no confidence</a> by the faculty, the alumni, and the Assembly (Shimer's democratic governing body), president <a>Thomas Lindsay</a> stepped down in April 2010.
He was succeeded by <a>Ed Noonan</a>, a Chicago-area architect and longtime Trustee of the college.
The Great Books movement began with the work of <a>John Erskine</a>, who founded a <a>Socratic</a> seminar using great books at <a>Columbia University</a> in 1919.
This seminar profoundly impacted Erskine's colleague <a>Mortimer Adler</a>, who came to believe that the purpose of education was to engage student's minds &quot;in the study of individual works of merit ... accompanied by a discussion of the ideas, the values, and the forms embodied in such products of human art.&quot;
<a>Robert Maynard Hutchins</a>, who led the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951, brought Adler to the U. of C. and wholeheartedly  embraced his ideas.
In 1931, Hutchins implemented the  &quot;Chicago Plan&quot;, which later became known as the &quot;Hutchins Plan&quot;.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Chicago program comprised sequences in the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences which were supposed to integrate past and present work within these divisions of knowledge.
In addition, these sequences were capped by work in philosophy and history.
The emphasis in teaching was on small classes with bright students, where discussion could supplant monologue as the dominant pedagogic technique....
At the same time, in order to retain high academic standards and contact with the &quot;frontiers of knowledge&quot;, the College's pedagogy emphasized reading originals (sometimes although not invariably, defined as Great Books).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shimer,  which had been affiliated with the U. of C. since 1896, adopted the Hutchins plan entirely in 1950, including the Chicago syllabi, comprehensive examinations, and several of their instructors.
The U. of C. abandoned the program after Hutchins left in 1951, but Shimer maintained it, and has done so through the decades that followed.</p>
<p>The 200-book reading list remains largely faithful to the original Hutchins plan, but new works are judiciously added to the core curriculum; these have included voices originally overlooked in the formation of the canon.
It now includes, for example, works by  <a>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, <a>Carol Gilligan</a>, <a>Frantz Fanon</a>, and <a>Michel Foucault</a>, along with other contemporary authors.
Readings are organized by broad historical and philosophical themes, rather than conventional fields.
Small seminars  are the sole form of instruction; even the natural sciences are taught via discussion.
The classes, which are composed of on average eight and no more than twelve students, read and discuss only original source material.</p>
<h4>Core</h4>
<p>The core curriculum of Shimer College is a sequence of 16 required courses in humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and <a>interdisciplinary</a> studies.
The Basic Studies courses, numbered one and two, are generally taken during the first two years, and the Advanced Studies courses, numbered three and four, during the final two years.
The Advanced Integrative Studies courses, numbered five and six, are taken in the senior year.]]</p>
<p>The humanities core begins with the study of visual art and music and progresses through literature, philosophy and theology.
It culminates with  the final course, &quot;Critical Evaluation in the Humanities,&quot;  which seeks to unify the Humanities courses by approaching all of the areas of the Humanities theoretically through critical evaluation of significant works of the 18th century and later.
The course includes <a>Martin Buber</a>'s <em><a>I and Thou</a></em>,  <a>Immanuel Kant</a>'s <em><a>Critique of Judgment</a></em>, <a>Friedrich Nietzsche</a>'s <em><a>Beyond Good and Evil</a></em>, and <a>S&#x00f8;ren Kierkegaard</a>'s <em><a>Fear and Trembling</a></em>.</p>
<p>The social sciences sequence begins with study of the individual and society in the first course, proceeds to classical political thought in the second, then modern social and political theory in the third, and concludes with the &quot;Theories of Social Inquiry&quot; course, which focuses on statistical and interpretive methods in sociology, <a>linguistic</a> theory, and 20th century social thought, through works like  <a>Clifford Geertz</a>'s <em>The Interpretation of Cultures</em>, <a>Paolo Freire</a>'s <em><a>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</a></em>, <a>Michel Foucault</a>'s <em><a>Discipline and Punish</a></em>, and <a>Karl Mannheim</a>'s <em>Ideology and Utopia</em>.</p>
<p>The natural sciences core studies science as it has developed historically, beginning with the <a>presocratic</a> philosophers of the 6th century BC and the theory of atoms in the first course;  <a>evolution</a>, <a>genetics</a>, and animal behavior in the second; <a>optics</a> and the theory of <a>relativity</a> in the third; and concluding with  the study of <a>quantum physics</a> and <a>molecular biology</a>.
The natural science reading list includes <a>Albert Einstein</a>&#x2019;s <em>Relativity</em>,  <a>Isaac Newton</a>&#x2019;s <em><a>Opticks</a></em>, <a>Richard Feynman</a>&#x2019;s <em><a>QED</a></em>, <a>Antoine Lavoisier</a>&#x2019;s <em><a>Elements of Chemistry</a></em>, and <a>Charles Darwin</a>&#x2019;s <em><a>Origin of Species</a></em>.</p>
<p>The first basic integrative studies course teaches the fundamental skills in close reading and argumentation required to work with original source texts.
In the second course, logic and mathematics are studied in terms of the development of geometry and <a>axiomatic system</a>s in ancient and modern times.
The advanced integrative studies courses, in which students explore connections between the course texts and those they have studied in other courses, are the capstone of the Shimer curriculum.
The readings are arranged chronologically in a unified, full-year sequence to demonstrate their historical relationships,  beginning with the ancient epic poems  <em><a>The Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em> and <a>Homer</a>'s <em><a>Iliad</a></em>  and concluding with <a>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>'s <em><a>Faust</a></em>  and <a>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>'s <em>Reason in History</em>.</p>
<h4>Writing projects, comprehensive examinations, and thesis</h4>
<p>Students are required to complete a Semester Project during the final week of each term (known as Writing Week), on a topic they choose in conjunction with their advisor.
The project does not receive a grade, but is reviewed by the student's instructors in a Final Conference and must be accepted before the student can register for the following semester.
Students are also required to complete a separate substantial research paper before registering for the Advanced Integrative Studies courses.</p>
<p>Students must pass at least two comprehensive examinations to graduate.
Each comprehensive examination involves several days of reading and writing, and may include an oral component as well.
After completing the Basic Studies courses, all students must pass the Basic Studies Comprehensive Examination to continue on to higher level courses.
Weekend students have ranged from 23 to 70 years of age and come from all over the country; weekend students have commuted from as far as Florida and New York.
The program enrolled 35 to 40 students in 2010.</p>
<p>Shimer first offered a year of study abroad, in <a>Paris</a>, in 1961 and has held the program biennially in <a>Oxford</a>, <a>England</a>, since 1963.
The Shimer-in-Oxford program allows eight to fifteen students to spend either one or two semesters in Oxford with a Shimer professor.
The students, who are in their third and fourth years, take one course from the core curriculum each term and the remainder of their work as individual or very small group tutorials with academics from in and around the <a>University of Oxford</a> in subjects the students select themselves.</p>
<p>The Teaching Fellows Program offers a <a>graduate</a>-level Great Books course designed for <a>kindergarten</a> through <a>12th grade</a> school teachers.
Shimer does not award graduate degrees, but teachers earn <a>professional development</a> credit through the program.
The program complements traditional education courses by providing the background knowledge required for teachers to give more content-rich instruction.
The program was developed in conjunction with the <a>Core Knowledge Foundation</a>, which was founded in 1986 by <a>E.D. Hirsch, Jr.</a>, author of <em>Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know</em>, to promote a common core of learning in <a>elementary school</a> education.</p>
<p>The Great Books + Law program, launched in 2007, is offered in conjunction with the  <a>Chicago-Kent College of Law</a> (the Law School of the Illinois Institute of Technology).
It allows students to count their first year of law school towards their Shimer degree and receive their <a>J.D.</a> in a total of five years instead of seven.
A joint program has also been operated since 2009 with <a>Harold Washington College</a> (HWC), one of the very few <a>community colleges</a> to offer a Great Books program.
The program allows HWC students to take one Shimer course, and is meant to encourage students to transfer to Shimer to complete their bachelor's degree.</p>
<h3>Faculty</h3>
<p>As of 2009, Shimer had eleven full-time and two part-time faculty; twelve of the thirteen hold doctorate degrees.
The student-faculty ratio is eight to one.
Applicants are asked to write an essay analyzing their academic experience, while displaying their creative talents.
This, along with a personal interview, is the major criterion for admission.
For weekend students, who have typically been out of school for some years, work and prior college experience are also taken into account.
The average GPA of incoming students is 3.29 on a four point scale.</p>
<p>Shimer's <a>Early Entrant program</a>, which admits students who have not yet graduated from high school, was first launched in 1950.
In 2008, 16 percent of new students were early entrants or home-schooled students of a similar age.</p>
<p>In 2009&#x2013;2010, full-time tuition and fees were $21,000 and on-campus room and board was $12,000.
Ninety-one percent of undergraduates received financial aid; the average aid package was $10,594.</p>
<h3>Recognition and accomplishments</h3>
<p> In 2009, Shimer was ranked 82nd among liberal arts colleges by <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em> (WM), while it was unranked by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> (USNWR).
In 2006, Shimer was selected as one of the top 50 colleges in <em>All-American Colleges: Top Schools for Conservatives, Old-fashioned Liberals, and People of Faith</em>, which highlights &quot;programs that connect in a special way with the core values of the American founding and the vibrant intellectual traditions of the West&quot;.
<a>Barron's</a> named Shimer one of the 300 best buys in college education, noting that &quot;the success of the Shimer curriculum depends a great deal on the knowledge and skill of the faculty facilitators, who receive accolades ranging from 'fantastic' to 'brilliant.
In 2000, <em><a>Insight Magazine</a></em> named Shimer one of the most <a>politically incorrect</a> schools in the nation, a list which recognized &quot;colleges that had strong and effective traditional curricula that were not obsessed with the recent educational fads and fetishes such as <a>multiculturalism</a> and <a>diversity</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2007, Shimer joined a national effort by the Educational Conservancy to boycott participation in college-ranking surveys altogether.
Then President <a>William Craig Rice</a> said &quot;what Shimer does well&#x2014;educating ourselves in on-going dialogue with the greatest minds of the past&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be captured in the <em>U.S. News</em> measurements.&quot;
Nearly all Shimer students take the <a>Graduate Record Exam</a> (GRE), a <a>standardized test</a> for <a>graduate school</a> admissions, their <a>senior</a> year, outscoring three of four potential graduate students and &quot;consistently rank among the best in the nation in scores on the verbal and analytical portions of the test&quot;, with average analytic scores in the 91st percentile.
A 2009 report by <em>The Washington Monthly</em> ranked Shimer third in graduate Ph.D. rate among U.S. liberal arts colleges.
In a 1998 study by the <a>University of Wisconsin</a>, Shimer was found to have the highest rate of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college and the third highest of any undergraduate program in the nation.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

Designed by architect [[Walter Netsch]] in 1962, it is named for the founder of <a>Motorola</a>.]]</p>
<p>Shimer relocated to the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2006, after 25 years at its former Waukegan, Illinois location, which comprised a loose collection of vintage houses, an old <a>YWCA</a>, and an apartment building.
Then-president Rice believed that the new location would attract a wider pool of students and financial contributors, and would offer expanded student services (such as dining and athletic facilities) and opportunities to cooperate academically with IIT.</p>
<p>The  campus is centered around 33rd and State Streets, approximately  south of the <a>Chicago Loop</a>, in the historic <a>Bronzeville</a> neighborhood on the <a>South Side</a> of Chicago.
Also known as the Black Metropolis District, the area is a landmark in African-American history for the many notable African-American people and institutions that thrived there in the mid-20th century.
The extant structures from that period were added jointly to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1986, and were designated a <a>Chicago Landmark</a> in 1998.</p>
<p>The campus on which Shimer resides was designed by <a>modernist</a> architect <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>, described by the <em>New York Times</em> as &quot;one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture&quot;.
Van der Rohe's master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived and the campus, with 20 of his works, is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world.
The campus was landscaped by van der Rohe's close colleague <a>Alfred Caldwell</a>, one the last representatives of the <a>Prairie School</a> of landscape architects.
In 1976, the <a>American Institute of Architects</a> named the IIT campus one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States.
The IIT Main Campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.</p>

Students have informally dubbed it the &quot;building under the tracks&quot; or B.U.T.T.
The complex, designed by van der Rohe, consists of four buildings built between 1947 and 1955.
The South building was home to the first industrial <a>nuclear reactor</a> in the U.S. Shimer has access to the resources of the Paul V. Galvin Library, IIT's main research library, which contains 1.8 million volumes, more than 25,500 journal titles, and a wide range of digital resources.
Shimer's own collection of 15,000 books is also housed in the Galvin library, where it was moved when the school relocated from Waukegan.</p>
<p>Other facilities available to Shimer students include the <a>McCormick Tribune Campus Center</a> (MTCC), which was designed by internationally acclaimed architect <a>Rem Koolhaas</a> in 2003.
The facility is the main student activity center, with food courts, a newsstand, lounge areas, conference centers, computer workstations, a bookstore, and an auditorium.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right| alt= People seated on a circle of chairs in a large room with hanging lights from the ceiling and a table visible in the foreground | The Shimer assembly in action in 2010.
Democratic self-governance at Shimer grew out of the collective efforts of the faculty and students to save the school in the late 1970s.</a></p>
<p>Shimer College is a <a>not-for-profit</a> corporation with a self-perpetuating <a>Board of Trustees</a> responsible for the affairs and the assets of the college.
The board delegates authority to the president of the college, who acts as the chief executive administrator, and to the <a>dean</a> of the college and the faculty regarding academic affairs.
As of December 2009, the board had 36 members (including three students and two faculty), with a target membership of 40, and was chaired by Christopher B. Nelson, president of <a>St.
John's College</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;As a function of its mission to promote active citizenship&quot;, Shimer states that it is &quot;devoted to internal self-governance to an extent that is rare among institutions of higher education.&quot;
Since 1977, Shimer has been governed internally by a deliberative body called the assembly.
Students and faculty are elected by the community at large to serve on all administrative bodies, including the Board of Trustees, such that &quot;all the top-down bureaucracy of traditional colleges and universities has been replaced by participatory democracy committed to dialogue.&quot;
The assembly has no legal authority, but governs, Shimer states, &quot;by virtue of the moral suasion established by communal deliberation&quot;.
Begun informally in the years immediately prior to the move to Waukegan, the assembly was formalized by a constitution in 1980.
Voting members include all students, faculty, administrators, staff and trustees.
Alumni are also members but do not vote.
The assembly advises the administration and conducts the business of the college through a system of committees with purview over administration, academic planning, budgeting,  admissions, grievances, financial aid, and quality of life.
Committees are composed of faculty, staff, and students elected by the assembly as a whole.</p>
<p>Shimer students are also represented on, and free to participate in, the IIT <a>Student Government</a> Association (SGA), which acts as a liaison to the university administration and a forum for express student opinion.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left| alt=five young people sitting on stone wall in front of modern sculpture and tree | Shimer students at the Galvin Library in 2006.
Shimer students have access to all student activities on offer at IIT.</a> <em>The New York Times</em> has called Shimer &quot;one of the smallest liberal arts colleges in the United States&quot;, and described Shimer students as &quot;... both valedictorians and high school dropouts.
What the students share, besides a love of books, is a disdain for the conventional style of education.
Many say they did not have a good high school experience.&quot;
Students tend to be individualistic, creative thinkers, and are encouraged to be questioning and inquisitive.
Shimer enrolled 100 students in 2009, from 22 states and two other countries; the majority came from Illinois.
Over 80 percent of the students were white and 40 percent were over age 25.
The college has a tradition of community meals, which all are invited to attend, that dates back to the early days on the Waukegan campus, when the whole community would meet for <a>potluck</a> meals and discuss matters of general interest in gatherings that eventually gave birth to the Assembly.</p>
<p>The Shimer theater program has been under the direction of Humanities Professor Eileen Buchanan since 1967.
Buchanan, also a professional actor and director, directs productions that complement the curriculum and offer anyone who wants to participate in theater the chance to do so.
Productions in the Chicago location have included <a>Anton Chekhov</a>'s <em><a>Uncle Vanya</a></em>, <a>Eve Ensler</a>'s <em><a>Vagina Monologues</a></em>, and an adaptation of <a>Raymond Chandler</a>'s &quot;Trouble Is My Business&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the resources of the MTCC and the athletic facilities, Shimer students are able to take part in the more than 150 student organizations sponsored by IIT, including <em>Liit Magazine</em>, the student-run literary magazine of IIT, and IIT's on-campus radio station, <a>WIIT</a>, where they can host their own shows.</p>
<p>Shimer students do not necessarily graduate with specific career skills.
Another ten percent attend law school and five percent go to business school.
Nearly twenty-five percent of graduates are employed in education (from elementary schools through college), seven percent are lawyers, and seven percent work in computer software.
The remainder occupy all walks of life, from consulting to social services, to non-profit organizations.
Shimer graduates include poets and authors such as <a>Peter Cooley</a>, who has sponsored a Shimer College poetry contest for many years, as part of the University and College Poetry Prize Program of the <a>Academy of American Poets</a>; poet <a>Stephen Dobyns</a>;  <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>-nominated writer <a>John Norman Maclean</a>, author of the bestselling <em><a>Fire on the Mountain</a></em>; and award-winning comic book writer and editor <a>Catherine &quot;Cat&quot; Yronwode</a>.
Alumni also include notable political theorists such as Arab-Israeli conflict scholar <a>Alan Dowty</a> and <a>Robert Keohane</a>, author of the seminal work <em>After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy</em>, and political activists such as <a>C.
Clark Kissinger</a>, former National Secretary of <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a> (SDS) and <a>situationist</a> <a>Ken Knabb</a>.
Computer pioneers <a>Nick Pippenger</a> and <a>Daniel J. Sandin</a> went to Shimer, as did experimental artists <a>Laurie Spiegel</a> and <a>Ken Friedman</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other notable alumni include medical inventor, <em><a>Slate</a></em> columnist, and <a>Yale University School of Medicine</a> professor <a>Sydney Spiesel</a>; <a>Whitman College</a> <a>Classics</a> professor <a>Elizabeth Vandiver</a>; author, activist, and internet publisher <a>Heather Corinna</a>; computer software author <a>Steve Heller</a>; philosopher and chess <a>Grandmaster</a> <a>Jesse Kraai</a>; and <a>Florida</a> State Representative <a>Ron Schultz</a>.
Chicago businessman and Shimer graduate Peter Hanig co-organized the international public art exhibit <a>CowParade</a> in 1999.</li>
