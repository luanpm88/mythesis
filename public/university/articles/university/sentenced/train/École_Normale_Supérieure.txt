<p> The <strong>&#x00c9;cole normale sup&#x00e9;rieure</strong> (; also known as <strong>Normale sup&#x2019;</strong>, <strong>Normale</strong>, and <strong>ENS</strong>) is one of the most prestigious <a>French</a> <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em> (higher education establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public universities system).
The ENS was initially conceived during the <a>French Revolution</a>, and it was intended to provide the <a>Republic</a> with a new body of <a>teacher</a>s, trained in the critical spirit and secular values of the <a>Enlightenment</a>.
It has since developed into an elite institution which does not offer degrees as such, but has become the platform for France's brightest young people to pursue high-level careers in government and academia.</p>
<p>Its alumni have provided France with scores of philosophers, writers, scientists, statesmen and even churchmen.
Among them are 12 <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates, 10 <a>Fields Medalists</a>, 1 <a>Gauss Prize</a> laureate, and 2 recipients of the John Bates Clark Medal in Economics.</p>
<p>For a long time, women were taught at a separate ENS.
The two were merged, after some heated debate, into a single entity, with its main campus at the historic site at the rue d'Ulm in <a>Paris</a>.</p>
<p>The ENS system is different from that of most higher education systems outside France, although it has been copied since Napoleonic times, for instance in Italy.
Nevertheless, the <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (From 2010 two separate rankings will be produced by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and the <a>QS World University Rankings</a>) ranked it the best higher-education institution in Continental Europe in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>The historic Paris ENS campus is located around the rue d'Ulm, the main building being at 45 rue d'Ulm) in the <a>5th arrondissement of Paris</a>.
The ENS-Ulm has annex campuses on Boulevard Jourdan (previously, the women's college) (, elsewhere in <a>Paris</a>), and in <a>Montrouge</a> (a suburb; ), as well as a biology annex in the countryside at Foljuif.</p>
<p>Three other <em>&#x00e9;coles normales sup&#x00e9;rieures</em> were established in the 19th century: the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Lyon</a> (sciences) and <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines</a> (humanities), both in <a>Lyon</a>; and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Cachan</a> (pure and applied sciences, sociology, economics and management, English language) in <a>Cachan</a>.
These schools challenge the supremacy of the ENS-Ulm.
For example, a French think-tank ranked the ENS-Lyon above the ENS-Ulm in the sciences.
In the humanities, the ENS Lettres et sciences humaines (ENS-LSH) has a competitive entrance exam which is as selective as that for the ENS-Paris.
All four together form the informal ENS-group.</p>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure is a member of <a>Paris Universitas</a>, a union of six Parisian universities.</p>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure cooperates in <a>Atomium Culture</a>, the first Permanent Platform for European Excellence that brings together some of Europe's leading universities, newspapers and businesses.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>[[Image:ENS Ulm cour Ernests DSC00106.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The
[[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the main ENS building on rue d'Ulm is known as the <em>Cour aux Ernests</em> &ndash; the Ernests being the goldfish in the pond.]]
Originally founded to train high school teachers through the <em><a>agr&#x00e9;gation</a></em>, it is now an  institution training researchers, professors, high-level civil servants, as well as business and political leaders.
It focuses on the association of training and research, with an emphasis on freedom of curriculum.</p>
<p>Its alumni include ten laureates of the <a>Fields Medal</a> (all French holders of the Fields medal were educated at the &#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure), as well as several <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners in both science and literature.</p>
<p>Like many other <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em>, the ENS mostly enrolls its students two or three years after high school.
The majority of them come from <em>pr&#x00e9;pas</em> (preparatory classes, see <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>) and have to pass France's most selective competitive exams.
Studies at ENS last four years.
Many students devote the third year to the <a>agr&#x00e9;gation</a>, which allows them to teach in high schools or universities.
ENS-Ulm annually enrolls about 100 students in science and the same number in the humanities.</p>
<p>The <em>normaliens</em>, as the students of the ENS are known, are expected to maintain a level of excellence in the various disciplines in which they are trained.
Normaliens from <a>France</a> and other <a>European Union</a> countries are considered civil servants in training.
As such, they are paid a monthly salary, in exchange for an agreement to serve France for 10 years, including their studies.
Although it is seldom applied in practice, this exclusivity clause is redeemable (often by the hiring firm).</p>
<p>Apart from the <em>normaliens</em>, ENS also welcomes selected foreign students (&quot;international selection&quot;), as well as selected students from neighboring universities, to follow the same curriculum but without a stipend.
It also participates in various graduate programs and has extensive research laboratories.</p>
<p>The fictitious mathematician <a>Nicolas Bourbaki</a>'s &quot;association of collaborators&quot; is based at ENS.</p>

<h2>Influence abroad</h2>
<p>The <a>Scuola Normale Superiore</a> in <a>Pisa</a> was founded  in 1810 as a branch of the &#x00c9;cole normale sup&#x00e9;rieure and later gained independence.</p>
<p>The ENS group has opened a branch at the <a>ECNU</a> in <a>Shanghai</a>.</p>
<h2>Free online content</h2>
<p>Some lectures are in free access on the <a>&quot;Transfer of knowledge&quot;</a> site of the ENS.</p>
<p>About fifty books are in free access on the <a>&quot;&#x00c9;ditions Rue d'Ulm&quot; site</a>, all in French.</p>
