<p> <strong>St.
Mary's College of Maryland</strong>, established in 1840, is a public, secular <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>St.
Mary's City, Maryland</a>.
It is a member of the <a>Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges</a> and designated as a Public Honors College (the only one in the state of Maryland and one of few around the U.S.).
St. Mary's College is a small college, with about 2,000 enrolled students.
The institution offers baccalaureate degrees in 22 disciplines, of which psychology, biology, and economics are among the most popular.
The institution also offers one postgraduate degree, a Masters of Arts in Teaching.
The college shares much of its campus with Historic St. Mary's City, the fourth site of colonization in <a>British North America</a> and one of the premier archaeological sites on the East Coast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>St.
Mary&#x2019;s College of Maryland came into existence (on paper only) by an act of the Maryland State Board of Higher Education in 1966.
The first bachelor&#x2019;s (B.A.) degrees were awarded in 1971.</p>
<p>The predecessor institution was St. Mary&#x2019;s Seminary Junior College (1949&#x2013;1968), in turn preceded by St. Mary&#x2019;s Female Seminary Junior College (1927&#x2013;1949).
Both of these &#x201c;junior colleges&#x201d; combined the last two years of high school and the first two years of college, making it a four-year institution.
After earning an <a>associate's degree (A.A.)</a> at St. Mary's girls would often continue studies at another university, where they would study for two more years and receive a <a>B.A.</a></p>
<p>The original St. Mary&#x2019;s Female Seminary was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1840.
In 1840, the word &#x201c;seminary&#x201d; meant only that it was an academy or a high school, not a religious institution.
St. Mary&#x2019;s was established by the legislature to be strictly non-denominational.
It was a boarding school that included the elementary grades as well as grades 9-12, though education did not go beyond the 12th grade.
Occasionally boys from the neighboring areas were allowed to take classes.
</p>
<p>The institution was named after St. Mary's City, the colonial site of <a>Lord Baltimore</a>&#x2019;s experiment in religious tolerance.
The institution was built upon land that once had been inhabited by the colonists two hundred years before.</p>
<p>For roughly the first 100 years (1840-1937) of its existence, the head of St. Mary's was called the &#x201c;principal.&#x201d;
When the school received accreditation as a junior college and included within the Maryland state budget in 1937, the term &#x201c;principal&#x201d; was changed to &quot;president.&#x201d;
The current president is Dr.
Joseph Urgo.</p>
<h2>General information</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|View of the St. Mary's River from the St. Mary's College of Maryland campus.</a>
The campus borders the <a>St.
Mary's River</a>.</p>
<p>St.
Mary's, although a state-operated institution, is independent of the <a>University System of Maryland</a>; it opted out of the system in 1992.
However, in early 2006, St. Mary's joined the University of Maryland Academic Telecommunications System (UMATS), which interconnects the University System of Maryland with several other networks, including the Internet and <a>Internet2</a> networks.</p>
<p>St.
Mary's mascot is the Seahawk, which is a nickname for the <a>osprey</a>s that can be found nesting in the near off-shore areas.
The school colors are Navy Blue, Yellow Gold, and White.
The Seahawks compete in <a>NCAA Division III</a>.
St. Mary's athletics are recognized for the storied varsity <a>baseball</a> team and the nationally-ranked varsity <a>sailing</a> team.</p>
<h3>Green initiatives</h3>
<p>Goodpaster Hall, an academic building devoted to Chemistry, Psychology, and Educational Studies that opened in January 2008, was built to a <a>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) rating of Silver.
It is one of few &quot;<a>green</a>&quot; buildings in the state of Maryland.</p>
<p>Other green initiatives include a student-supported green energy referendum, campus composting, and a geothermal system in the new River Center.</p>
<h3>Mission statement</h3>
<p>&quot;Founded on the site of Maryland&#x2019;s first capital, the College stands as a living legacy to the ideals of freedom and inclusiveness.
Our beautiful residential campus on the banks of the St. Mary&#x2019;s River inspires our work, our play, and our commitment to the environment.&quot;
</p>

<h3>Relationship with Historic St. Mary's City</h3>
<p>St.
Mary's College of Maryland and the Historic St. Mary's City have a close relationship.
Students are often hired to work within the historic site, and those who aren't working are frequently found to be walking or biking along the miles of trail throughout Historic.
Current students may visit the historical site for free.</p>
<p><a>The Maryland Heritage Project</a> is an effort to bring together the College, Historic St. Mary's City, Trinity Episcopal, a church located near the St. Mary's campus, and the wider community.
Two new buildings, to be used jointly by the College and Historic St. Mary&#x2019;s City, are being built on campus.
One of the buildings is a new interpretive center, which will showcase artifacts from St. Mary&#x2019;s City history &#x2013; from the colony established in 1634, to the farmlands that replaced that colony in the 18th century, to the founding of the monument school in the mid-19th century, and beyond.
The second building will be an academic building that will replace Anne Arundel Hall, a current St. Mary's academic building.
This building will include Historic St. Mary's City's research offices, and faculty offices and classrooms for St. Mary's College in Anthropology, Democracy Studies, History, International Languages and Cultures, and Museum Studies.
It will host collection-based courses and summer institutes.</p>

The Center focuses on an interdisciplinary understanding of early Maryland as an &quot;emerging democracy,&quot; and applies the lessons of the region's history to a domestic and international discussion of democracy's role in the modern world.
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) We the People initiative awarded the Center a $500,000 challenge grant in September 2004.
The Center has until April 2008 to raise $1.5 million in private and non-federal funds to meet the matching requirements.&quot;
