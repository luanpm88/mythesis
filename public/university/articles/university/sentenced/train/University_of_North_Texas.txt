<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The university was founded in 1890 by Joshua Crittenden Chilton as the <strong>Texas <a>Normal College</a> and Teachers' Training Institute</strong> and was originally housed in leased facilities above a hardware store.
After three years tenure, facing financial hardships and declining health, Chilton agreed to release his title and interest in the school to the City of Denton.
Since its inception, the institution's name has been changed six times.
In 1894, the name became <strong>North Texas Normal College</strong>, followed by <strong>North Texas State Normal College</strong> in 1901.
The institution was known as <strong>North Texas State Teachers College</strong> in 1923, <strong>North Texas State College</strong> in 1949, and <strong>North Texas State University</strong> in 1961, before becoming the University of North Texas in 1988.
The <a>Texas State Historical Association</a> moved its operations from <a>Austin</a> to UNT in November 2008.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> The University contains 12 college and schools and offers 97 bachelor's, 101 master's and 48 doctoral degree programs.
For much of its history, UNT has been known for its <a>College of Music</a> and the university is often regarded as a &quot;music school&quot;.
UNT's College of Music was founded in 1890 as the Normal Conservatory of Music and is today recognized for its <a>jazz</a> program and the world-renowned <a>One O'Clock Lab Band</a>.
Several of the university's colleges have been founded within the past decade, including the College of Information, the College of Engineering and the Mayborn School of Journalism.
UNT is also home to the <a>Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science</a>, a two-year residential early college entrance program, and the <a>Turkish Institute for Police Studies</a>.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Mascot</h3>
<p> UNT's mascot is the <a>eagle</a> and was adopted in 1922 in a student election over the dragon, the lion and the cottontail rabbit.
This selection is said to have reflected the student population's ideals of individual liberty and freedom of expression, values the UNT community continues to cherish.
Barefoot students are a relatively common sight on or off campus, for example.
The costumed eagle character, Scrappy, appears at sporting and university events, though he didn't always go by that name; in 1974, students who felt &quot;Scrappy&quot; was too warlike dubbed the bird &quot;Eppy,&quot; and he kept that name until 1995.
Athletic teams are referred to as the &quot;Mean Green.&quot;
This name is usually associated with football star and 1969 graduate <a>&quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene</a>, a legendary member of the famous <a>Steel Curtain</a> defense of the 1970s <a>Pittsburgh Steelers</a>; however, accounts vary about the actual origins of &quot;Mean Green.&quot;</p>
<p>In the spring of 2002, the school's chapter of the Albino Squirrel Preservation Society attempted to make the group's namesake the school's secondary mascot.
The student body narrowly rejected the measure.
If it had passed, it would have made North Texas the nation's second university to have a secondary mascot.
In August 2006, the albino squirrel, believed to bring luck to students who spotted him before an exam, was killed by a red-tailed hawk.
By May 2007, another albino squirrel had been born on the campus.</p>

<h3>Traditions and symbols</h3>
<h4>UNT Fight Song</h4>
<p>After winning a university sponsored contest, alumnus Francis Stroup wrote the school's fight song in 1939.
Throughout the years, the song has changed its lyrics to reflect the name changes of the university.</p>
<p><em>Let's give a cheer for U of NT...</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Cheer for the Green and White!</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Victory's in store, whate'er the score,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Our team will ever fight, fight, fight!</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Shoulder to shoulder we march along,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Striving for victory.</em>&lt;br
/&gt; <em>Playing the game for the honor</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>and fame and the glory of UNT!</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>U...N...T....Eagles!
U-N-T Eagles,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Fight!
Fight!
Fight!</em></p>
<h4>Alma Mater</h4>
<p>In 1919, <a>Julia Smith</a>, member of the university's band (now called the <a>Green Brigade</a>), composed <strong>&quot;Glory to the Green and White&quot;</strong> which was adopted as the school's <a>alma mater</a> in 1922.</p>
<p><em>Singing glory to the green,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Singing glory to the white,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>For we know our university is</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>striving for the right,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Down the corridor of years,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>We'll forget the joys and tears,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>But North Texas, North Texas,</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>We love!</em>&lt;br /&gt;<em></em></p>
<h4>Traditions</h4>
<p><a>right|thumb|&quot;In High Places&quot; is a prominent representation of the eagle on campus.</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Bell<strong></strong></a> is a 2,000-pound bell brought in from Michigan in 1891 to signal class changes and curfew.
Members of the Talons spirit group later began running it up and down the field at football games; it was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack.
A 1,600-pound Spirit Bell is currently in use at games.</li>
  <li>[<a>http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/pics/bell.jpg'''McConnell</a>|Tower<strong>], the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building in the center of campus, is bathed in green light for each victory by a UNT athletic team.
It appears on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the One O'Clock Lab Band) and 7:00 (the 1892 curfew time for Texas Normal College and Teacher Training Institute students).</strong></li>
<li>The <a>talon<strong></strong></a> hand gesture is made by curling the thumb, index and middle fingers forward, leaving the ring finger and pinky closed against the palm.</li>
<li>A [<a>http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/rush/bonfire/burning.jpg'''Bonfire'''</a>] is built with thousands of pallets donated by <a>Miller Brewing</a> of Denton and the local <a>Peterbilt</a> plant.
The pallets are stacked in a 40-foot by 40-foot footprint then stacked to a final height of 25 feet.
It is assembled by members of the [<a>http://orgs.unt.edu/talons'''Talons'''</a>]
spirit group the week before Homecoming and is lit on the Friday night of Homecoming week (when a burn ban is not in effect).</li>
<li><a>the Cannon<strong></strong></a>, hand crafted from solid oak on the Denton campus, the 7/8th scale M1841 6 pound, smooth bore muzzleloader cannon has been used to signify scores by the Mean Green since Fall 1970.
Since that time &quot;Boomer the Cannon&quot; has gone through three different phases of restoration by Talon alumni.
The final was in the Fall of 2007 in which the final phase saw him fitted with a custom Limber to assist with transportation and equipment handling.</li>
<li>The <a>Machine<strong></strong></a> is a green 1931 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan and is driven by members of the <a>Talons Cannon Crew</a> at home football games and special events.
This should not be confused with the <em>Mean Green Machine,</em> a large mechanical eagle trailed by remote panel in a truck, controlled by three physics students, that made Homecoming and other appearances between 1968 and 1976.
The Green Machine is currently undergoing an overhaul by members of Talons Cannon Crew.</li>

High Places&quot;<strong>], a 22-foot-tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by Gerald Balciar, is a popular landmark and meeting place, and is often decorated in green for school spirit.
It was dedicated during the university's centennial celebrations in 1990.</strong></li>
