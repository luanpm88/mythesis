<p><strong>Tampere University of Technology</strong> (<strong>TUT</strong>) () is Finland's second largest <a>university</a> in engineering sciences.
The university is located in <a>Hervanta</a>, a suburb of <a>Tampere</a>.</p>
<p>The university's statutory duty is to pursue research and give highest education in its field.
The research, conducted by some 1,800 staff and faculty members, mostly focuses on applied science and often has close ties to many different companies (like <a>Nokia</a>).
Located next to the university campus is a Technology Centre <a>Hermia</a>, including a large Nokia research facility.
The yearly budget of the university is some 120 million <a>euros</a>.
Like all Finnish universities, TUT is state-funded.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> From the late 19th century, Tampere had been the most important industrial center in Finland.
The Technical Institute of Tampere had provided engineers for its industries since 1911, but all higher technological education in Finland took place in <a>Helsinki University of Technology</a>.
In 1950's, the city of Tampere started actively remedying the situation, first founding a municipal <a>scientific library</a> in 1955.
This library later formed the core for the libraries of the TUT and the medical faculty of the University of Tampere In 1960, city succeeded in persuading the small private university <em>Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu</em> to move to Tampere from Helsinki.
A few years later, this university changed its name to <a>University of Tampere</a>.</p>
<p>The founding of the Tampere University of Technology was one of the steps of the city and the local business life in bringing higher education to the region.
The university was founded in 1965 as a branch of <a>Helsinki University of Technology</a> and became an independent university status in 1972.
The Student Union of Tampere University of Technology (<em>Tampereen teknillisen yliopiston ylioppilaskunta, <a>TTYY</a></em>) was also established alongside with the university.</p>
<p>In 2003, the university changed its Finnish name from TTKK (<em>Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu</em>) to TTY (<em>Tampereen teknillinen yliopisto</em>) so that the Finnish name would be closer to the <a>English</a> name and to distinguish itself from polytechnics that are not universities in the meaning of the Humboldtian university ideal or in the meaning of the Finnish law.</p>
<p>As a part of the Finnish university reform, Tampere University of Technology chose to become one of the two Finnish universities operating as <a>foundation</a>s in the beginning of 2010.
The university hopes that compared to the previous form of state agency, the foundation form gives it more operational freedom.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Tampere University of Technology is primarily a <a>research university</a>, which specializes in technology and architecture.
While all departments pursue scientific research and publish in international, peer-reviewed journals, the strongest areas of the university are <a>signal processing</a>, <a>nanophotonics</a>, <a>biotechnology</a>, and intelligent mobile hydraulic systems.
The university has one Finnish Center of Excellence, the Signal Processing Laboratory.
In addition, it participates in two other Finnish Centers of Excellence.
</p>
<p>In 2007, the researchers of TUT published 1282 papers in peer-reviewed international publications, meaning an average of a little more than one article per researcher.
</p>
<p>The university has 131 full professors, 78 tenured lecturers, and 842 researchers.
Depending on the prior education of the student, the doctoral degree is either <em>tekniikan tohtori</em> (<a>Doctor of Science</a> in Technology or Architecture) or <em>filosofian tohtori</em> (<a>Doctor of Philosophy</a>).
As a general rule, the graduate students with a Master's degree in Technology or Architecture will be awarded the Doctor of Science degree, while graduate students with a Master's degree in other majors will be awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
A <em>tekniikan lisensiaatti</em> (<a>Licentiate of Technology</a>) is also available.
Yearly, some 70 doctors graduate.
The mean age of new doctors is 34.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p> All undergraduate students are members of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology.
Post-graduate students are given the option of joining.
In addition to the student union, students join numerous associations for studies, cultural activity, and sports.
Each of the 14 guilds at TUT serve the students in their respective study program.</p>
