It has campuses in Chile located in Valparaiso, Vina del Mar, Santiago, Talcahuano and Rancagua, as well as a campus in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
UTFSM was the first Chilean university to confer a Doctorate in engineering in 1963.
</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The university has four campuses and two branch campuses (<em>sedes</em>).
These are located in four Chilean cities and <a>Guayaquil, Ecuador</a>.
These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Casa Central</strong>, main campus.
Inaugurated in 1931, located in <a>Valpara&#x00ed;so</a></li>
  <li><strong>Campus Santiago Vitacura</strong> and <strong>Campus Santiago San Joaqu&#x00ed;n</strong>[<a>http://www.santiago.usm.cl</a>],
located in the Chilean capital, <a>Santiago</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Campus Guayaquil</strong>[<a>http://www.usm.edu.ec</a>],
located in <a>Guayaquil, Ecuador</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Sede <a>Jos&#x00e9; Miguel Carrera</a></strong>[<a>http://www.jmc.utfsm.cl</a>],
located in <a>Vi&#x00f1;a del Mar</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Sede <a>Rey Balduino de B&#x00e9;lgica</a></strong>[<a>http://www.rbb.utfsm.cl</a>],
located in seaport city of <a>Talcahuano</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the campuses are focused on undergraduate, graduate and university academical activities, <em>sedes</em> are mainly dedicated to technical degrees.</p>
<h3>Casa Central, Valpara&#x00ed;so</h3>
<p>The main UTFSM campus is located in Valpara&#x00ed;so, covering most of the front area of <strong>Los Placeres</strong> hill.
The site directly faces the <a>Pacific</a> coast and it is visible from many parts of the bay of Valpara&#x00ed;so.</p>
<p>The building was designed by Josu&#x00e9; Smith Solar, one of the most respected Chilean architects of the 20th century, and his son Jos&#x00e9; Smith Miller.
The American <a>Neo-Gothic</a> style campus is considered one of the foremost works of Chilean architecture.
The campus is also recognised for its beautiful <a>gardening</a>, with native and exotic species.</p>
<p>In 2001, the illumination of the university frontis was renewed through a contest organised by the Chilean branch of <a>Philips</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Due to the focused nature of the university, its organisation does not include different <a>faculties</a>, only different academic departments.</p>
<p>Within the Chilean campus level, there are 12 departments, which carry out research and graduate/undergraduate educational programs.</p>
<p>UTFSM is the only Chilean engineering school that includes sports as an obligatory course in the <a>curriculum</a>.</p>
<p>The university offers careers of <a>Commercial Pilot</a> and <a>Aeronautical Engineering</a> in its <strong>Academia de Ciencias Aeron&#x00e1;uticas</strong>[<a>http://www.aca.cl</a>] in a joint venture with Chilean airline <a>Lan Chile</a> .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university takes its names from <a>Federico Santa Mar&#x00ed;a</a>, a Chilean who lived in <a>France</a>.
He raised a huge fortune as a broker in the sugar market in <a>Paris</a>.</p>
<p>In his testament, Santa Mar&#x00ed;a donated all his fortune to build in <a>Valpara&#x00ed;so</a>&mdash;his hometown&mdash;a high-standard technical and scientific institution.
This institution would be dedicated to prepare students with great potential to gain technical and scientific knowledge, so they could contribute to the progress of Chile.</p>
<p>Following his philosophy, on March 31, 1926, an institution was created to develop Santa Mar&#x00ed;a's legacy.
Finally on 1931 the School of Crafts and Arts and School of Engineering <a>Jos&#x00e9; Miguel Carrera</a> was founded.
In 1935 its name changed to <em>Universidad T&#x00e9;cnica Federico Santa Mar&#x00ed;a</em>.</p>
<p>In 1960 the Graduate School was created.
In 1963 the university became the first higher-education institution in <a>Latin America</a> to confer a <a>doctorate</a>.</p>
