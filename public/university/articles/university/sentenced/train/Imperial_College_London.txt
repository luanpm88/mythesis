<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Royal School of Mines entrance.</a></p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The origins of the constituent elements of Imperial can be traced back as far as the fifteenth century.
The <a>College of St Gregory and St Martin at Wye</a> was originally founded in 1447 as a seminary, with an agricultural college being established at Wye in the 1890s after the removal of the theological college.
The medical schools of Charing Cross Hospital, Westminster Hospital and St Mary's Hospital were opened in 1823, 1834 and 1854 respectively.
The <a>Royal School of Mines</a> was founded by <a>Sir Henry de la Beche</a> in 1851, laying one of the foundation stones for scientific teaching in Britain.
The <a>Royal College of Science</a> was established in 1881 and the <a>City and Guilds College</a> in 1884.
Imperial merged with the <a>National Heart and Lung Institute</a> in 1995 and the <a>Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School</a>, Royal Postgraduate Medical School (RPMS) and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997.
In that year the Imperial College School of Medicine was formally established.
In 1998 the Sir Alexander Fleming Building was opened in order to provide purpose-built headquarters for the College's medical and biomedical research.</p>
<p>In 2000 Imperial merged with both the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and <a>Wye College</a>, the University of London's agricultural college in Wye, Kent.
In December 2005, Imperial announced a science park programme at the Wye campus; however, this was abandoned in September 2006 following local environmental complaints.
<a>Wye College</a> will now be run by the <a>University of Kent</a> from September 2007 in association with Imperial College London and <a>Wye College</a>, graduates will receive a degree from the <a>University of Kent</a> and an Imperial Associateship of Wye College.</p>
<h3>21st century</h3>
<p>In May 2001 a new faculty structure was established, with all departments being assigned to the Faculties of Engineering, Medicine, Physical Sciences and Life Sciences.
A merger with <a>University College London</a> was proposed in October of that year, but was abandoned a month later following protests from staff over potential redundancies.
In 2003 Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council.
In 2004 the Tanaka Business School (now named the <a>Imperial College Business School</a>) and a new Main Entrance on Exhibition Road were opened by Her Majesty The Queen.
In November 2005 the faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences merged to become the Faculty of Natural Sciences.</p>
<p>On 9 December 2005, Imperial College announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.
Imperial became fully independent from the University of London in July 2007 and the first students to register for an Imperial College degree were postgraduates beginning their course in October 2007, with the first undergraduates enrolling for an Imperial degree in October 2008.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:PM Skating scimus2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The [[Natural History Museum]] on <a>Exhibition Road</a>]]</p>
<p>Imperial College's activity is centred on its <a>South Kensington</a> campus, situated in an area with a high concentration of cultural and academic institutions known as the <a>Albertopolis</a>; the <a>Natural History Museum</a>, the <a>Science Museum</a>, the <a>Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, the <a>Royal College of Music</a>, the <a>Royal College of Art</a>, the <a>Royal Geographical Society</a> and the <a>Royal Albert Hall</a> are all nearby.
Imperial College has two other major campuses &#x2014; at <a>Silwood Park</a> (near <a>Ascot</a> in <a>Berkshire</a>) and at <a>Wye</a> (near <a>Ashford</a> in <a>Kent</a>).
The Imperial College NHS Trust runs multiple hospitals throughout <a>Greater London</a> and various medic lectures are conducted within these hospitals, including <a>St.
Mary's Hospital</a>, <a>Charing Cross Hospital</a>, <a>Northwick Park Hospital</a> &amp; <a>St.
Mark's Hospital</a> and <a>Hammersmith Hospital</a>.
In 1997, the parliamentary <a>Imperial College Act 1997</a> officially transferred all the obligations, powers and property of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, the National Heart and Lung Institute and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School to Imperial College.
The expansion of the South Kensington campus in the 1960s absorbed the site of the former Imperial Institute, designed by <a>Thomas Collcutt</a>, of which only the  high <a>Queen's Tower</a> remains among the more modern buildings.</p>
<p>Extensive renovation continues throughout the College estate.
Recent major projects include the <a>Imperial College Business School</a>, the Ethos sports centre, the Southside hall of residence and the Eastside hall of residence.
Current major projects include the reconstruction of the south-eastern quadrant of the campus.</p>
<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>

<h3>Faculties and departments</h3>
<p>Imperial&#x2019;s research and teaching is organised within a network of faculties and academic departments.
Imperial currently has the following three constituent faculties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Imperial College Faculty of Engineering</a></li>
  <li><a>Imperial College Faculty of Medicine</a></li>
  <li><a>Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a>Imperial College Business School</a>, Graduate Schools, Department of Humanities and Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine exist as academic units outside of the faculty structure.</p>
<p>The humanities department's main purpose is to provide elective subjects and language courses outside the field of science for students in the other faculties and departments.
Students are encouraged to take these classes either for credit or in their own time, and in some departments this is mandatory.
Courses exist in a wide range of topics including philosophy, ethics in science and technology, history, modern literature and drama, art in the twentieth century, film studies.
Language courses are available in French, German, Japanese, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin Chinese.
The humanities department also runs a full-time course in <a>scientific translation</a>, and is home to the Science Communication Group  which offers Masters degrees in <a>Science Communication</a> and Science Media Production for science graduates.</p>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>In the financial year ended 31 July 2010, Imperial had total income (including share of joint ventures) of &#x00a3;694.0 million (2008/09 - &#x00a3;672.1 million) and total expenditure of &#x00a3;651.2 million (2008/09 - &#x00a3;657.4
million).</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Imperial received &#x00a3;286.8 million from research grants and contracts in 2008/09, the second highest amount of any British university (after the <a>University of Oxford</a>).</p>

<p>According to the most recent <a>RAE</a> 2008, five subjects including Pure Mathematics, Epidemiology and Public Health, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical, Aeronautical and Manufacturing Engineering are assessed to be the best in terms of the proportion of internationally recognised research quality.</p>
<p>Imperial College has a dedicated <a>technology transfer</a> company known as <a>Imperial Innovations</a>.
Imperial actively encourages its staff to commercialise its research and as a result has given rise to a proportionally large number of <a>spin-out</a> companies based on academic research.</p>
<p>Imperial College, in conducting research on <a>Parkinson's disease</a> and <a>Multiple Sclerosis</a>, hosts a brain bank consisting of brains donated by individuals affected with either of these diseases.

<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>Imperial College London is among the most selective universities in the UK.
From 1999 to 2009 (dates of all the online available records), the overall acceptance rate of Imperial College programmes has been consistently below 20% and, in 2009, the acceptance rate of the college for undergraduates was 15.3%.
The acceptance rate for postgraduate courses was 19.5%.
and the <a>University of Cambridge</a> is one of the first universities in the UK to make use of the A* grade at <a>A Level</a> for admissions, with engineering and physics courses requiring an A* in Mathematics.
Mathematics and Computer Science courses themselves require A* grades in Mathematics and Further Mathematics, along with another A grade at A Level, making them the only courses in the UK to routinely ask for 2 A*s at A-Level.</p>
<p>Imperial announced in summer 2008 that it was exploring the possibility of entrance exams to help it select the most suitable students.
Since then, the College has been reviewing and piloting a range of assessment approaches, such as subject-specific tests, skills tests and motivation-based tests as part of enhanced interviews and will continue to do so during the 2009-10 academic year.
The Cambridge Thinking Skills assessment (TSA) was one test trialled on existing Imperial College students.
No date is set for the implementation of any entrance exam for applicants.
Medicine at Imperial already uses the BMAT as part of the selection process.</p>

The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining around 300 clubs and societies, the largest number of any students' union in the United Kingdom.
The Union operates two different sites; Beit Quad, South Kensington and Reynold's, Hammersmith.
On top of this the college also runs an additional site, the Holland Club, on the South Kensington campus.</p>
<p>The <a>Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union</a> looks after the social, academic and welfare needs of the 2,200 students within the faculty.</p>
<h3>Student Media</h3>
<h4>Imperial College Radio</h4>
<p><a>Imperial College Radio</a> (or ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student <a>halls of residence</a> from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976.
It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad <a>over the internet</a> www.icradio.com
and, since 2004, on 1134 <a>AM</a> in Wye.
The radio station has a library of over 51,000 tracks, which are searchable on their website.</p>
<p>In 2006 IC Radio received two nominations in the <a>Student Radio Awards</a>: Best Entertainment Show for Liquid Lunch and Best Male Presenter for Martin Archer.</p>
<p>Popular shows on IC Radio in recent years (2006/2007) include: <a>Rocktopia</a>, School Daze' (<a>pop</a>), 'Instru(Mental)' (<a>dance</a>), 'VPT' (Entertainment/Shambles), 'Peter and James' 'Moon Unit' and 'The Cornerstone' (both of which play <a>rock</a> and <a>alternative</a>) and 'Album - A Discourse in Musical History' (devoted to seminal <a>album</a>s).</p>
<p>Imperial College Radio is now best known for its specialist dance music shows, with the likes of Believe The Hype (Electro/Indie), Peer Pressure (Techno) and On Dancefloors (Electro/House) gaining critical acclaim and notoriety not just in college but throughout London.</p>
<h4>stoic TV</h4>
<p><a>stoic tv</a> (Student Television of Imperial College) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operating from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block.
The department had bought an early <a>AMPEX</a> <a>Type A 1-inch videotape recorder</a> and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room.
A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972.
Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block and interview programmes with DJ <a>Mike Raven</a>, <a>Richard O'Brian</a> and <a>Monty Python</a> producer <a>Ian MacNaughton</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 it was named Best Broadcaster at <a>NaSTA</a> and also won awards for Best On-Screen Male and Best On-Screen Female.
It now broadcasts from studios in the specially built media centre in the Student Union to the Junior Common Room and occasionally DaVinci's Bar.
Programmes are also available to watch on their website.</p>
<p>There is also a non-student Imperial College organisation called Media Services, whose main activity is producing videos of College events.</p>
<h4>Felix</h4>
<p>Published weekly, <em><a>Felix</a></em> is the free student newspaper of Imperial College London.
It aims to be independent of both the College itself and also the Student Union.
The editor is elected annually from the student body; the editorship is a full-time, sabbatical position.
There is also a non-student Imperial College newspaper called <em>Reporter</em>, and <em><a>London Student</a></em> distributes on campus.</p>
<p>In 2006 and 2008, Felix won the <a>Guardian Student Media Awards</a> for <em>Student newspaper of the year</em> and <em>Student journalist of the year</em>.</p>
<h4>Live!</h4>
<p>Live! is an online student news source and forum run by the <a>City and Guilds College Union</a>.
Live! also enables readers to view published articles from <a>Livic</a>, the monthly newspaper of <a>CivSoc</a>, the student society in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Content on Live! is text-based <a>news</a>, with one or more photographs per article to illustrate the event.
At the start of 2007  the ability to display videos was added, increasing the breadth of its <a>coverage</a>.
Co-operation with Imperial's student television station, stoic tv has led to the introduction of politically-focused video content on the site by syndicating weekly news bulletins and the &quot;Ask the President&quot; show.
Live! was also named the best student website in the 2007 <a>Guardian Student Media Awards</a>.</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p>[[Image:Beit Hall (596508429).jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Beit
Hall]] (student housing)]]</p>
<p>Imperial College owns and manages <a>twenty halls of residence</a> in <a>Inner London</a>, <a>Ealing</a>, <a>Ascot</a> and <a>Wye</a>.
Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.</p>
<p>The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having <a>en suite</a> facilities.
Study bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms.
The majority of rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.
Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.</p>
<p>Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, since they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial College as their firm offer at <a>UCAS</a>.
The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the College private housing office.
However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a &quot;hall senior&quot;.</p>
<p>Some students are also selected to live in <a>International Students House, London</a>.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>The <a>El Salvador Project</a> is a charitable volunteer project that is constructing earthquake-proof buildings in the poorer areas of <a>El Salvador</a>.
About 10 students from the Civil and Environmental Engineering department travel to El Salvador each year to carry out construction work.</p>
<p>Teams from Imperial won <a>University Challenge</a> in 1996 and 2001.</p>
