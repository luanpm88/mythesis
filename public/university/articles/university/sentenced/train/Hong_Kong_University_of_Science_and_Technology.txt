<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:HKUST Sundial.JPG|left|thumb|The main entrance of the HKUST with the red [[Sundial]]]]</p>
<p>In the late 1980s the <a>Hong Kong Government</a> anticipated a strong demand for university graduates to fuel an economy increasingly based on services.
Sir <a>Chung Sze Yuen</a> and the Governor of Hong Kong, <a>Sir Edward Youde</a>, conceived the idea of another university in Hong Kong.
Envisioning the establishment of an internationally competitive university, planning for the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology began in 1986.
Construction began at the former British garrison <a>Kohima Camp</a> in <a>Tai Po Tsai</a> on the <a>Clear Water Bay Peninsula</a>.
</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to finish in 1994, the death of Sir Edward in 1986 led to increased effort and allowed for UST to open its doors early - in 1991.
<a>Thomas E. Stelson</a> was also a founding member of the administration.</p>
<p>The project was heavily criticized for surpassing the budget originally set forth by the Hong Kong Government and <a>Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club</a>.
However, under the fund raising efforts of its Vice-Chancellor at the time, <a>Woo Chia-wei</a>, the first students enrolled in October 1991.
By 1992, accommodation as well as athletic facilities were expanded to support about 7,000 students.
Several more expansion projects such as the construction of the HKUST Enterprise Centre have since been completed and current efforts include the expansion of housing facilities scheduled for completion for 2009.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb||HKUST Campus as seen from Port Shelter</a> The university campus (<a>layout</a>) occupies a  site which is divided into a several sections: the Academic Building, S.H. Ho Sports Hall, student halls, outdoor sports facilities, the University Centre, apartments, staff quarters and the President's Lodge.
Being constructed along the slope of the surrounding hills, beautiful Port Shelter is clearly visible from virtually every building on campus.
Arranged in cascades, the buildings are connected by walkways and several balconies thus offer a spectacular view of the <a>South China Sea</a>.</p>
<h3>The Academic Building</h3>
<p>The Academic Building contains all lecture theatres, classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices.
There are 10 lecture theaters (A-H, J-K) as well as a multitude of classrooms and labs.
They are designed to accommodate classes of up to 450 students and all offer the latest audiovisual equipment.
Access to UST's wireless network is available throughout most of the Academic Building as well as the surrounding areas.
Information Technology Services Center (<a>ITSC</a>) operates and maintains a multitude of modern computer laboratories and computational facilities.
IT services are extensive and access to services provided by ITSC, including printing resources and UNIX time-sharing facilities, is easy, reliable and universally available.</p>

A selection of these maps, providing an insight into the history of international geographic knowledge, has been published by the library in a limited-edition (1000 copies) volume in 2003.</p>
<h3>Student Housing</h3>
<p>On-campus housing is available for undergraduate as well as postgraduate students.
However, there are insufficient places available for the entire student population.
While international as well as exchange students are generally guaranteed on-campus housing, spaces are appropriated on a competitive basis to the remainder of mostly local applicants.</p>
<p>With housing fees being very low relative to off-campus accommodation, students live in one of several halls.
Generally, a room is shared between two or three students.
While sinks are present in newer rooms, showers as well as toilets are shared.
Similarly, students have access to one or more common rooms per floor.
These include a television, water boiler, microwave, telephone as well as a fridge.
Common rooms face the bay, include a balcony and are often used for study as well as group discussions.
Wireless access is present in many common rooms although wall sockets for wired access to the campus network are universally installed throughout all student halls.
Additionally, there are four (4) university apartment towers (A-D).
Housing arrangements in the apartment towers vary.
In general, however, an apartment of four rooms, including a small kitchen and common area is shared by four occupants.
Apartment housing is extremely scarce and is several times more expensive than standard shared accommodation.</p>
