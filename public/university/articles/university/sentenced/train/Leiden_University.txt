<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|The Academy building of the Leiden university</a> In 1575, the emerging <a>Dutch Republic</a> did not have any universities in its northern heartland.
The only other university in the Netherlands was in southern <a>Leuven</a>, firmly under Spanish control.
The scientific renaissance had begun to highlight the importance of academic study, so <a>Prince William</a> founded the first Dutch university in Leiden as a reward for the heroic <a>defence of Leiden</a> against Spanish attacks in the previous year.
Ironically, the name of <a>Philip II of Spain</a>, William's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate, as he was still the <em>de jure</em> <a>count of Holland</a>.
It is traditionally said that the citizens of Leiden were offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from <a>tax</a>es, and that the citizens believed that a tax law could be rescinded, whereas the great universities of Europe had survived for many centuries.
Originally located in the convent of St Barbara, the university moved to the convent of the White Nuns in 1581, a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed in 1616.</p>
<p>The presence within half a century of the date of its foundation of such scholars as <a>Justus Lipsius</a>, <a>Joseph Scaliger</a>, <a>Franciscus Gomarus</a>, <a>Hugo Grotius</a>, <a>Jacobus Arminius</a>, <a>Daniel Heinsius</a> and <a>Gerhard Johann Vossius</a>, at once raised Leiden university to the highest European fame, a position which the learning and reputation of <a>Jacobus Gronovius</a>, <a>Herman Boerhaave</a>, <a>Tiberius Hemsterhuis</a> and <a>David Ruhnken</a>, among others, enabled it to maintain down to the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, Leiden University again became one of Europe's leading universities.
At the world&#x2019;s first university low-temperature laboratory, professor <a>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</a> achieved temperatures of only one degree above absolute zero of -273 degrees Celsius.
In 1908 he was also the first to succeed in <a>liquifying helium</a> and can be credited with the discovery of the superconductivity in metals.
</p>
<p><a>Kamerlingh Onnes</a> was awarded the <a>Nobel Prize</a> for Physics in 1913.
Three other professors received the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: <a>Hendrik Antoon Lorentz</a> and <a>Pieter Zeeman</a> received the <a>Nobel Prize</a> for their pioneering work in the field of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist <a>Willem Einthoven</a> for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of electrocardiography.</p>
<p>These Nobel prize winners, but also the physicists <a>Albert Einstein</a> and <a>Paul Ehrenfest</a>, the Arabist and Islam expert <a>Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje</a>, the law expert <a>Cornelis van Vollenhoven</a> and historian <a>Johan Huizinga</a>, were among those who pushed the university into a place of international prominence during the 1920s and 1930s.
In 2005 the <a>manuscript</a> of <a>Einstein</a> on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the <a>Einstein-Bose condensation</a>) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.</p>
<p>At present, Leiden has a firmly established international position among the top research institutes in many fields, including the natural sciences, medicine, social and behavioural sciences, law, arts and letters.
Of the fifty-nine <a>Spinozapremie</a> (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), fifteen were granted to professors of the Universiteit Leiden.
Literary historian <a>Frits van Oostrom</a> was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award for his work on developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre.
Other <a>Spinozapremie</a> winners are linguists <a>Frederik Kortlandt</a> and <a>Pieter Muysken</a>, mathematician <a>Hendrik Lenstra</a>, <a>Carlo Beenakker</a>, who works in the field of mesoscopic physics, <a>Ewine van Dishoeck</a>, astronomer at <a>Leiden Observatory</a>, transplantation biologist <a>Els Goulmy</a>, clinical epidemiologist <a>Frits Rosendaal</a>, <a>Rien van IJzendoorn</a> professor of education and child studies, physicist <a>Jan Zaanen</a>, archeologist <a>Wil Roebroeks</a>, neurologist <a>Michel Ferrari</a>, classicist <a>Ineke Sluiter</a>, social psychologist <a>Naomi Ellemers</a> and astronomer <a>Marijn Franx</a>.
Among other leading professors are <a>Wim Blockmans</a>, professor of Medieval History, and <a>Willem Adelaar</a>, professor of <a>Amerindian Languages</a>.</p>
<p>The portraits of many famous <a>professor</a>s since the earliest days hang in the university aula, one of the most memorable places, as <a>Niebuhr</a> called it, in the history of science.
</p>
<p>The <a>University Library</a>, which has more than 3.5 million books and fifty thousand journals, also has a number of internationally renowned special collections of western and oriental manuscripts, printed books, archives, prints, drawings, photographs, maps, and atlases.
Scholars from all over the world visit <a>Leiden University Library</a>, the oldest in the Netherlands.
The research activities of the <a>Scaliger Institute</a> focus on these special collections and concentrate particularly on the various aspects of the transmission of knowledge and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day.
</p>
<p>Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The <a>KITLV</a> or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the <a>observatory</a> 1633; the natural history museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the museum of antiquities (<em>Museum van Oudheden</em>), with specially valuable <a>Egypt</a>ian and <a>India</a>n departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was <a>Philipp Franz von Siebold</a>'s <a>Japan</a>ese collections.
The <a>anatomical</a> and <a>pathological</a> laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of <a>geology</a> and <a>mineralogy</a> have been restored.</p>
<p>The <a>Hortus Botanicus</a> (botanical garden) is the oldest <a>botanical garden</a> in the Netherlands, and one of the oldest in the world.
Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries.
The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese <a>Siebold Memorial Museum</a> symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Research at Leiden is well developed.
There are many university research institutes and Leiden participates in over forty nation-wide research schools, twelve of which being located in the heart of Leiden.</p>
<h2>The institution</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Leiden University Medical Center</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|A new professor's inauguration lecture in the <em>Academiegebouw</em>, 2008</a> The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city.
Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while buildings like Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern.
The university is divided into six major faculties which offer approximately 50 <a>undergraduate</a> degree programs and over 100 graduate programs.</p>
