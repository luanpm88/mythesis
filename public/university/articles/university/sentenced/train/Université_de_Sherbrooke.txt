<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke established as a <a>French speaking</a> Catholic university in a region that was predominantly <a>English speaking</a>.
Initially there was a religious component to the <a>pedagogical</a> activities, but by the end of the 1960s the number of priests working for the university had greatly diminished.
In 1975, the appointment of a <a>layman</a> as Rector marked the end of religious activity in the institution.
The Department of <a>Theology</a> is still officially Roman Catholic, alone in Quebec in this regard.</p>
<p>Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke's arms, supporters, flag and badge were registered with the <a>Canadian Heraldic Authority</a> on January 15, 2004.
Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke's crest and Supporters were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on April 20, 2007.
The motto of the school is <em>Veritatem in Charitate</em> (&quot;Truth through charity&quot;).</p>
<p>In 2006, the university opened a branch of its medical facility on the campus of <a>UQAC</a>, where its students enroll for non-medical courses.
The number of students attending the Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke continues to rise and the university has worked with the City of Sherbrooke to respond to the increase.
Activities at the Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke are mainly centred on teaching and research.</p>
