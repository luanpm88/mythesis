<p><strong>Universiti Tenaga Nasional</strong> (Abbreviation:<strong>UNITEN</strong>, English:Tenaga Nasional <a>University</a>) is a <a>private research</a> <a>university</a> located in Kajang, Selangor.
UNITEN has five colleges containing 15 academic departments offering <a>engineering</a>, <a>information technology</a>, <a>business management</a> programs and related areas.</p>
<p>Universiti Tenaga Nasional is one of the earliest private universities in <a>Malaysia</a> and is wholly-owned by public-listed <a>Tenaga Nasional Berhad</a> (TNB), one of the largest <a>electricity</a> <a>utility companies</a> in <a>Asia</a>.
Universiti Tenaga Nasional prides itself on moving rapidly towards establishing itself as the regional center of educational excellence by year 2020.
The support and commitment it receives from its <a>holding company</a>, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), has enabled it to accelerate the infrastructure development of the campus.</p>
<p>The curricula, further enhanced with project work, <a>research</a>, open-ended <a>experiment</a>s and <a>practical training</a>, are designed with linkages with the industrial and commercial sectors as well as from local and foreign universities.
The emphasis of the university is on producing effective and marketable <a>professional</a>s to fulfill the needs of the industry in particular and the nation in general.
All academic programs are formulated to meet the academic requirements of the <em>Malaysian Qualification Agency</em> (MQA, formerly 'LAN'or the National Accreditation Board of Malaysia).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Universiti Tenaga Nasional started as Institut Latihan Sultan Ahmad Shah (ILSAS) in 1976, which served for many years as the corporate training center for <a>Tenaga Nasional Berhad</a> (TNB) and its predecessor, the National Electricity Board (LLN).</p>
<p>In 1994, TNB was invited to propose for the setting up of an institution of higher learning and eventually ILSAS was transformed into an institute of higher learning and renamed Institut Kejuruteraan Teknologi Tenaga Nasional (IKATAN).
It offered academic programs in engineering and business management at undergraduate and graduate levels through <a>twinning</a> links with local and foreign universities particularly the <a>Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis</a> (IUPUI) program.
In 1997, IKATAN was upgraded to Universiti Tenaga Nasional.</p>
<p>The number of programs offered by Universiti Tenaga Nasional would be increased accordingly, in line with its commitment to serve Malaysia's needs and of other countries that look to Malaysia for assistance to meet their requirements for tertiary education.
In 10 years of its short yet fruitful existence over 9000 students have graduated and attained successful positions in various industries.
Uniten graduates can be seen in many multinationals such as <a>Intel</a>, <a>Shell</a>, <a>Schlumberger</a>, <a>ESSO</a>, <a>Sony</a>, <a>Carrier</a>, <a>Petronas</a> and governmental agencies as diplomatic and administration officers among others .</p>
