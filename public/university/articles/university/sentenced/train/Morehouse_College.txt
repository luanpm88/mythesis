<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>In 1867, just two years after the <a>American Civil War</a>, the Augusta Institute was founded by William Jefferson White, an Atlanta Baptist minister and cabinetmaker, with the support of the Rev. Richard C. Coulter, a former slave from <a>Atlanta, Georgia</a>, and the Rev. Edmund Turney, organizer of the <a>National Theological Institute</a> for educating freedmen in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3>Modern history</h3>

</p>
<pre>  </pre>
<p>Morehouse College is home to a 7,000-piece collection of original documents written by Martin Luther King, Jr. (referred to as the King Collection).
The set was valued by the <a>Library of Congress</a> as being worth between $28 to $30 million dollars and was originally scheduled by his family to be auctioned off to the general public in 2006, but private donors in Atlanta intervened and offered a pre-auction bid at $32 million.

<a>Coca Cola</a> donated a land parcel valued at $10 million in order to assist with the development of the project.
The collection includes King's 1964 <a>Nobel Prize</a> acceptance speech.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Regulation of student conduct</h3>
<p>In October 2009, Morehouse College initiated a student dress code that prohibits wearing women's clothes, <a>jewelry on their teeth</a>, pajamas as classroom attire, <a>tight fitting caps or bandannas on their head</a>s, or <a>pants which hang below the waist</a> at official college-sponsored events.
This dress code is part of the <em>Five Wells</em> which holds that, &quot;Morehouse Men are Renaissance Men with a social conscience and global perspective who are: Well-Read, Well-Spoken, Well-Traveled, Well-Dressed and Well-Balanced.&quot;
Dr. William Bynum, vice president for Student Services was quoted by CNN as saying, &quot;We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress [in] a way we do not expect in Morehouse men.&quot;
These remarks and the dress code itself have been the source of great controversy both on and off the campus.
They eventually led to President Franklin having to personally send out an email to the schools' alumni, clarifying and stressing that the university's new dress policy is not intended as an affront to gays.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
