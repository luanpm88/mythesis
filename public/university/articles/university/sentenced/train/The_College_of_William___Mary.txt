<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Colonial era: 1693&#x2013;1776</h3>
<p>[[Image:James Blair.jpg|thumb|left|[[James
Blair (Virginia)|Reverend Dr. James Blair]], founder of William &amp; Mary]] A school of higher education for both <a>Native American</a> young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the <a>Virginia Colony</a>.
The College was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to &quot;<em>make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and the good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.</em>&quot;
Named in honor of the reigning monarchs <a>King William III</a> and <a>Queen Mary II</a>, the College was one of the original <a>Colonial colleges</a>.
The Charter named James Blair as the College's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743).
William &amp; Mary was founded as an <a>Anglican</a> institution; governors were required to be members of the <a>Church of England</a>, and professors were required to declare adherence to the <a>Thirty-Nine Articles</a>.</p>
<p>The school's charter called for a center of higher education consisting of three schools.
The Philosophy School instructed students in the advanced study of moral philosophy (logic, rhetoric, ethics) as well as natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics); upon completion of this coursework, the Divinity School prepared these young men for <a>ordination</a> in the <a>Church of England</a>.
This curriculum made William &amp; Mary the first American college with a full faculty.</p>
<p>In 1693, the College was <a>given a seat</a> in the <a>House of Burgesses</a> and it was determined that the College would be supported by <a>tobacco</a> taxes and export duties on <a>fur</a>s and animal skins.
The College acquired a  parcel for the new school,  from Jamestown.
In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.</p>
<p><a>Williamsburg</a> was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780.
During this time, the College served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings.
It educated future U.S. Presidents <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a>James Monroe</a>, and <a>John Tyler</a>.</p>
<h3>Revolution and transition</h3>
<p>[[Image:Jamesmonroe-npgallery.jpg|thumb|right|[[James
Monroe]], 5th President of US, W&amp;M alumnus]] During the period of the American Revolution, <a>freedom of religion</a> was  established in Virginia and the <a>separation of church and state</a> achieved, notably with the 1786 passage of the <a>Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</a>.
Future U.S. President <a>James Madison</a> was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and <a>Right Reverend James Madison</a>, his cousin and <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>, who was on the <a>Board of Visitors</a>, helped The College of William &amp; Mary to make the transition as well.
The college became a university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine.
As its President, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.</p>
<p>The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first <a>collegiate secret society</a>, the <a>F.H.C.
Society</a>, founded November 11, 1750.
On December 5, 1776, students <a>John Heath</a> and <a>William Short</a> (Class of 1779) founded <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> as a secret literary and philosophical society.
It is today the nation's premier academic honor society, with chapters at colleges and universities across the United States.
Other <a>secret societies</a> known to currently exist at the College include: The <a>7 Society</a>, 13 Club, Alpha Club, <a>Bishop James Madison Society</a>, <a>Flat Hat Club</a>, The Society, The Spades, W Society, and <a>Wren Society</a>.</p>
<p>In 1842, alumni of the College formed the Society of the Alumni which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States.
In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College.
The <a>Alumni House</a> is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, and the Brafferton.</p>
<h3>Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Wren Building circa 1859</a> At the outset of the <a>American Civil War</a> (1861&#x2013;1865), enlistments in the <a>Confederate Army</a> depleted the student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the College for the duration of the conflict.
The <a>College Building</a> was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces.
The <a>Battle of Williamsburg</a> was fought nearby during the <a>Peninsula Campaign</a> on May 5, 1862, and the city fell to the Union the next day.
The <a>Brafferton building of the College</a> was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town.
On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building, purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover.
Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.</p>
<p>Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War.
The College's 16th president, <a>Benjamin Stoddert Ewell</a>, finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds but the College closed in 1882 due to lack of funds.
In 1888, William &amp; Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the <a>Commonwealth of Virginia</a> passed an act appropriating $10,000 to support the College as a state teacher-training institution.
<a>Lyon Gardiner Tyler</a> (son of US President and alumnus <a>John Tyler</a>) became the 17th president of the College following President Ewell's retirement.
Tyler, along with 18th president <a>J.A.C.
Chandler</a>, expanded the College into a modern institution.
In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since.
In 1918, William &amp; Mary preceded the <a>University of Virginia</a> to be one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become <a>coeducational</a>. [<a>http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html</a>]
During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.
<a>thumb|right|220px|The College, circa 1902</a> Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, <a>Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin</a>, the Sir Christopher Wren Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (the President's office) were restored to their eighteenth century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from <a>John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a> and his wife, <a>Abby Aldrich Rockefeller</a>.
Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of <a>Colonial Williamsburg</a>.</p>
<h3>1930&#x2013;present</h3>
<p> In 1930, William &amp; Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in <a>Norfolk, Virginia</a>.
This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as <a>Old Dominion University</a>.</p>
<p>Significant campus construction continued under the College's nineteenth president, John Stewart Bryan.
President <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> received an honorary degree from the College on October 20, 1934.[<a>http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10917FF3B5D167A93C3AB178BD95F408385F9&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=william%20and%20mary&amp;st=cse</a>]
In 1935, the <a>Sunken Garden</a> was constructed, just west of the Wren Building.
The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at <a>Chelsea Hospital</a> in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.</p>
<p>The College has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s.
In 1945, for example, the College administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in <a>The Flat Hat</a> supporting the end of <a>racist</a> policies of <a>segregation</a>, <a>anti-miscegenation</a> and <a>white supremacy</a>.
According to <a>Time Magazine</a>, in response, over one-thousand William &amp; Mary students held &quot;a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson.&quot;
She was pardoned by the college Board of Visitors decades later.</p>
<p>In 1960, another extension into the <a>Hampton Roads</a> region resulted in the founding of what would eventually become <a>Christopher Newport University</a>.</p>
<p>In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed <a>Ash Lawn-Highland</a>, the  historic <a>Albemarle County, Virginia</a> estate of alumnus and U.S. President <a>James Monroe</a>, to the College.
The College restored this historic presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it to the public.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> [[Image:Wren front.jpg|thumb|225px|upright|Modern
day Sir Christopher Wren Building with the statue of [[Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt|Lord Botetourt]]]] The College is located on a  campus in <a>Williamsburg, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Sir Christopher Wren Building</a> is the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.
The building colloquially referred to as the &quot;Wren Building&quot; was so named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect <a>Sir Christopher Wren</a>.
The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated that the 1699 design was &quot;first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren&quot; and then was adapted &quot;by the Gentlemen there&quot; in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion.
Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement.
The College's Alumni Association recently published an article suggesting that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.
A follow-up letter clarified the apocryphal nature of the Wren connection.</p>
<p>Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known as &quot;Ancient Campus&quot;: the <a>Brafferton</a> (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732).</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p> [[File:W Taylor Reveley III Crop.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Current president [[W.
Taylor Reveley III]]]] The Board of Visitors is a corporation established by the <a>General Assembly of Virginia</a> to govern and supervise the operation of the College of William &amp; Mary and of <a>Richard Bland College</a>.
The corporation is composed of 17 members appointed by the <a>Governor of Virginia</a>, based upon on the recommendations made by the Society of the Alumni, to a maximum of two-successive four-year terms.
The Board elects a Rector, Vice Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.</p>
<p>Until 1776, the chancellor was an English subject, usually the <a>Archbishop of Canterbury</a> or the <a>Bishop of London</a>, who served as the College&#x2019;s advocate to the crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus.
Following the Revolutionary War, General <a>George Washington</a> was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President <a>John Tyler</a> held the post.
The College has recently had a number of distinguished chancellors: former <a>Chief Justice of the United States</a> <a>Warren E. Burger</a> (1986&#x2013;1993), former <a>British Prime Minister</a> <a>Margaret Thatcher</a> (1993&#x2013;2000), and former <a>U.S. Secretary of State</a> <a>Henry Kissinger</a> (2000&#x2013;2005).
Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice <a>Sandra Day O'Connor</a> was installed as the College's 23rd Chancellor on April 7, 2006.</p>
<p>The Board of Visitors delegates to a president the operating responsibility and accountability for the administrative, fiscal, and academic performance of the College as well as representing the College on public occasions such as conferral of degrees.
The president is assisted by a provost, the senior academic officer of the university, and several vice presidents.</p>
<p>Faculty members are organized into separate faculties of the Faculty of Arts and Science as well as those for the respective schools of <a>Business</a>, <a>Education</a>, <a>Law</a>, and <a>Virginia Institute of Marine Science</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The College of William &amp; Mary is a medium-sized, highly residential, public research university.
The focal point of the university is its four-year, full-time undergraduate program which comprises most of the institution's enrollment.
The College also offers undergraduates a dual degree program in engineering with <a>Columbia University</a>.
[<a>http://www.wm.edu/as/undergraduate/curriculum/special/engineering/index.php</a>]
The College has a strong undergraduate arts &amp; sciences focus, with a select number of graduate programs in diverse fields ranging from American colonial history to marine science.
The graduate programs are dominant in <a>STEM fields</a> and the university has a high level of research activity.</p>
<p>William &amp; Mary has produced six <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> since 1989 and 60 students have won <a>Fulbright Scholarships</a>, Truman, and Goldwater fellowships since 2000.
According to the <a>Institute of International Education</a>, William &amp; Mary enjoys the highest <a>Fulbright Scholarship</a> acceptance rate (46%) of any major research university in America.
William &amp; Mary offers exchange programs with 15 foreign schools, drawing more than 12% of its undergraduates into these programs, and receives U.S. State Department grants to further expand its foreign exchange programs.
Former U.S. Secretary of State <a>Madeleine Albright</a> has called W&amp;M International Studies Department &quot;perhaps the finest in the nation.&quot;</p>
<h3>Learning environment</h3>
<p>William &amp; Mary is committed to ensuring the quality of its undergraduate teaching experience.
To advance this mission, W&amp;M provides a &quot;small college environment&quot; and maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of 12-to-1 (the second lowest among U.S. public universities), thereby fostering student-professor interaction.
A notable 99% of all undergraduate classes, excluding labs, are taught by professors (not teaching assistants) and 86% of all classes contain 40 or fewer students.
The 2011 <a>U.S. News</a> college rankings placed W&amp;M 5th in the nation for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; thereby supporting the efficacy of the College's mission.

<h3>Honor System</h3>
<p><a>upright|thumb|Thomas Jefferson</a> William &amp; Mary's <a>Honor System</a> was first established by alumnus <a>Thomas Jefferson</a> in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.
During the orientation week, nearly every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the <a>Wren Building</a> pledging: :<em>As a Member of the William &amp; Mary community I pledge, on my Honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal in either my academic or personal life.
I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust of which we are all stewards.</em></p>
<p>The basis of W&amp;M's Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alumnus and law professor <a>Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.</a>
While teaching law at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, Tucker proposed that students attach a pledge to all exams confirming that on their honor they did not receive any assistance.
Tucker's honor pledge was the early basis of the Honor System at the University of Virginia.
At W&amp;M, the Honor System stands as one of the College's most important traditions; it remains student-administered through the Honor Council with the advice of the faculty and administration of the College.
The College's Honor System is codified such that students found guilty of cheating, stealing or lying are subject to sanctions ranging anywhere from a verbal warning up to expulsion.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Crim Dell bridge in the heart of W&amp;M's wooded campus</a> William &amp; Mary has a number of traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as <a>Santa Claus</a> and reads a rendition of &quot;<a>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</a>&quot;, the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads &quot;Twas the Night Before Finals,&quot; and The Gentlemen of the College sing the song &quot;<a>The Twelve Days of Christmas</a>&quot;.  Christmas is a grand celebration at the College; decorated Christmas trees abound the campus.
This popular tradition in fact started when German immigrant Charles Minnegerode, a humanities professor at the College in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America.
Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor <a>St.
George Tucker</a>, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.

<p>Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the College.
Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the President of the College at his home with the <a>Alma Mater song</a>.
The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their &quot;departure&quot; from the College.
On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.</p>
<p>One unofficial tradition is the Triathlon, a set of three tasks to be completed by each student prior to graduation.
These include jumping the wall of the <a>Governor's Palace</a> in <a>Colonial Williamsburg</a> after hours (and if so inclined, running through the Boxwood Maze to the Palace itself), streaking through the <a>Sunken Garden</a>, and swimming in the <a>Crim Dell</a> pond.</p>
<p>Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William &amp; Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony.
The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William &amp; Mary sings the <a>William &amp; Mary Hymn</a>.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p> William &amp; Mary has a long history of <a>fraternities and sororities</a> dating back to <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, the first &quot;Greek-letter&quot; organization, which was founded there in 1776 .
Today, Greek organizations play an important role in the College community, along with other social organizations (e.g.
theatre and club sports organizations).
Overall, about one-third of its undergraduates are active members of 18 national fraternities and 12 sororities.
William &amp; Mary is also home to several unique non-Greek social fraternities, notably the Nu Kappa Epsilon music sorority and the <a>Queens' Guard</a>.</p>
<h3>A cappella</h3>
<p>William and Mary has eleven <a>collegiate a cappella</a> groups.</p>
<p>The Christopher Wren Singers (1987, co-ed); The Gentlemen of the College (1990,all-male); The Stairwells (1990, all-male); Intonations (1991, all-female); The Accidentals (1992, all-female); Reveille (1992, all-female); DoubleTake (1993, co-ed); Common Ground (1995, all-female); One Accord (1998,all-male); The Cleftomaniacs (1999, co-ed); Passing Notes (2002, all-female)</p>
<h3>Comedy groups</h3>
<p>William and Mary has two campus comedy groups.
I.T. (short for Improvisational Theatre) has been around since 1986, and has become a feeder into the professional improv scene in Chicago and Los Angeles, boasting performers with <a>The Second City</a>, <a>I.O.</a>, <a>ComedySportz</a>, and Mission IMPROVable.
In addition to performing shows across campus and Virginia, I.T. annually travels to Chicago as part of its Fall Tour, where new and returning members develop and practice their improvisational skills.
Every year culminates with Improvathon, a 12-hour show at the <a>Lake Matoaka Amphitheatre</a> to benefit Avalon, a local battered women's shelter.
The <a>sketch comedy</a> ensemble Seventh Grade has been in existence since 1997.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>right|300px|William &amp; Mary Tribe logo</a>  Formerly known as the &quot;Indians,&quot; William &amp; Mary's athletic teams are now known as the &quot;Tribe&quot;.
The College fields <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field.
In addition, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football.
In the 2004&#x2013;05 season, the Tribe garnered five <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a> titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles.
In that same year, several teams competed in the <a>NCAA</a> Championships, with the football team appearing in the <a>Division I-AA</a> national semifinals.
The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th at the Division I <a>NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship</a> in 2006 and 2009, respectively.
The William &amp; Mary men's basketball team is one of five original Division I schools that has never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.</p>
<p>There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe.
On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper <a>Adin Brown</a> was a back-to-back <a>NCAA First Team All-American</a> in 1998 and 1999.
The track program has produced several <a>All-America</a>ns, including Brian Hyde, an <a>Olympian</a> and collegiate record holder in the <a>1500-meter run</a>, and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the <a>5000-meter run</a> at the <a>2007 Pan American Games</a>.
The baseball program boasts a handful of current <a>MLB</a> players, including relief pitcher <a>Bill Bray</a> and <a>Minnesota Twins</a> utility infielder <a>Brendan Harris</a>.
The <a>football program</a> has also produced numerous <a>NFL</a> players and coaches: All-Pro safety <a>Darren Sharper</a>, current <a>Pittsburgh Steelers</a> head coach <a>Mike Tomlin</a>, cornerback <a>Derek Cox</a>, kicker <a>Steve Christie</a>, long snapper <a>Mike Leach</a>, <a>Walter Payton Award</a>-winning quarterback <a>Lang Campbell</a>, wide receiver <a>Dominique Thompson</a>, <a>Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> coaches <a>Marv Levy</a> and <a>Lou Holtz</a>,  and <a>Jacksonville Jaguars</a> linebackers coach <a>Mark Duffner</a>.</p>
<p>In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the American Indian community.
The College's appeal regarding the use of the institution&#x2019;s athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected.
The &quot;Tribe&quot; nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.
The College stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.
Some students have vowed to display the prior logo on their own at NCAA post-season games.
A new design was unveiled in December 2007.</p>
<p>For a short time, the College's unofficial mascot was a <a>green and gold frog</a> (though it was commonly referred to on campus simply as an 'amorphous green blob') called &quot;<a>Colonel Ebirt</a>&quot; (&quot;Tribe&quot; backwards), which was discontinued in 2005.
Prior to that, two students, one male, one female, dressed in buckskins.
The female was referred to as Pocohontas, while the male was usually referred to as &quot;tribe guy.&quot;
The practice ended around 1991.
Subsequently, a selection process was conducted to select the College's new mascot.
In December 2009, five finalists &#x2013; including a <a>Griffin</a>, <a>King and Queen</a>, the <a>Phoenix</a>, a <a>Pug</a> and the <a>Wren</a> &#x2013; were announced from more than 800 submissions.
On April 6, 2010, President Taylor Reveley announced that the College has selected the <a>Griffin</a> as its new mascot.</p>
