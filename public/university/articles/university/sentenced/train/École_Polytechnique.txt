<p></p>
<p>The <strong>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</strong> (commonly known as <strong>Polytechnique</strong> or, in France, by the nickname <strong>X</strong>) is a state-run institution of higher education and research in <a>Palaiseau</a>, near <a>Paris</a>, <a>France</a>.
Polytechnique is renowned for its four year undergraduate/graduate <a>Master's program</a>.
Called the <em>Ing&#x00e9;nieur Polytechnicien</em> (polytechnic engineer) program, this attracts the strongest students from the two-year post-secondary-school science and math <a>preparatory programs</a> for the <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>, provides them with a broad scientific education, and opens the way for many of them to careers in positions of influence in government, industry, and research.
In addition to the 2000 polytechnic engineer students, there are 200 students pursuing two-year Master's degrees and 500 doctoral students, for a relatively small total enrollment of 2700.</p>
<p>Polytechnique was established during the <a>French Revolution</a> in 1794, becoming a military school under <a>Napoleon</a> in 1804.
It relinquished this status to become a public educational establishment in 1970, though it is still overseen by the Ministry of Defense.
Initially, the school was located in the <a>Latin Quarter</a> in central <a>Paris</a>, and it moved to <a>Palaiseau</a> on the <a>Saclay plateau</a> about 14&nbsp;km (8.7&nbsp;mi) southwest of Paris in 1976.
It is a founding member of the <a>ParisTech</a> grouping of leading Paris-area engineering schools, established in 2007.</p>
<p>Polytechnique is one of the <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em> that have traditionally prepared <a>technocrats</a> to lead French government and industry.
Since 1995, Polytechnique has started to admit applicants from outside France to its polytechnic engineer program, and 20% are now foreign students.
This and other changes mean that many of the 500 students who graduate from the polytechnic engineer program each year now choose to pursue further university education rather than enter the French civil service.</p>

<h3>Early locations</h3>
<p>In 1794, Polytechnique was initially hosted in the <a>Palais Bourbon</a>.
One year later, it moved to H&#x00f4;tel de Lassay, an <a>h&#x00f4;tel particulier</a> in the <a>7th arrondissement of Paris</a>.</p>

<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<h3>Military status</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Polytechnique flag guard on Bastille Day 2008.</a></p>
<p>Polytechnique is a higher education establishment run under the supervision of the <a>French ministry of Defence</a>, through the <a>General Delegation for Ordnance</a> (administratively speaking, it is a national public establishment of an administrative character).</p>
<p>Though no longer a <a>military academy</a>, it is headed by a <a>general</a>, and employs military personnel in executive, administrative and sport training positions.
Both male and female French undergraduate <em>polytechniciens</em> are regular officers and have to go through a period of military training before the start of studies.</p>
<p>However, the <a>military</a> aspects of the school have lessened with time, with a reduced period of preliminary military training, and fewer and fewer students pursuing careers as military officers after leaving the school.
On special occasions, such as the military parade on the <a>Champs-&#x00c9;lys&#x00e9;es</a> on <a>Bastille Day</a>, the <em>polytechniciens</em> wear the 19th-century-style &#x201c;grand uniform&#x201d;, with the famous <em><a>bicorne</a></em>, or <a>cocked hat</a>, but students have not typically worn a uniform on campus since the elimination of the &#x201c;internal uniform&#x201d; in the mid-1980s.</p>
<h3>Activities and teaching staff</h3>
<p>Polytechnique has a combined undergraduate-graduate general engineering teaching curriculum as well as a graduate school.
In addition to the faculty coming from its local laboratories, it employs many researchers and professors from other institutions, including other CNRS, INRIA and CEA laboratories as well as the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> and nearby institutions such as the <a>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure d'&#x00c9;lectricit&#x00e9;</a> (<em>Sup&#x00e9;lec</em>), the <a>Institut d'Optique</a> or the <a>Universit&#x00e9; Paris-Sud</a>, creating a varied and high-level teaching environment.</p>
<p>Contrary to French public universities, the teaching staff at Polytechnique are <em>not</em> civil servants (<em>fonctionnaires</em>) but contract employees operating under regulations different from those governing university professors.
An originality of Polytechnique is that in addition to full-time teaching staff (<em>exercice complet</em>), who do research at the &#x00c9;cole in addition to a full teaching service, there are partial-time teaching staff (<em>exercice incomplet</em>) who do not do research on behalf of the &#x00c9;cole and carry only a partial teaching load.
Part-time teaching staff are often recruited from research institutions (CNRS, CEA, INRIA...) operating inside the &#x00c9;cole campus, in the Paris region, or even sometimes elsewhere in France.</p>

<h3>The <em>Polytechnicien</em> studies</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Polytechnicien program is broader than typical French university studies, often including topics beyond one's specialty.
This focus on <em>breadth rather than depth</em> has been hotly debated over the years, but it nevertheless forms a characteristic of the Polytechnicien program.
It is particularly useful for cross fertilization purposes between different fields, as graduates from Polytechnique most often have abilities in several disciplines; for example, they must follow at least six different topics during their second year.
Humanities and sports are also mandatory parts of the curriculum, adding to the differences with most French university programs.</p>
<h4>Admission</h4>
<p>The admission to Polytechnique in <em>polytechnicien</em> cycle is made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in <em><a>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a></em>.
Admission includes a week of written examinations during the spring followed by oral examinations that are handled in batches (<em>s&#x00e9;ries</em>) over the summer.</p>
<p>About 400 French students are admitted each year.
Foreign students, having followed a <em>classe pr&#x00e9;paratoire</em> curriculum (generally, French residents or students from former French colonies in Africa) can also enter through the same competitive exam (they are known as &#x201c;EV1&#x201d;). Foreign students can also apply through a &#x201c;second track&#x201d; (&#x201c;EV2&#x201d;) following undergraduate studies.
In total, there are about 100 foreign students each year and 64 nationalities are represented.
Most of them come from <a>Lebanon</a>, <a>Morocco</a>, <a>Algeria</a>, <a>Tunisia</a>, <a>Brazil</a>, <a>Chile</a>, <a>Ecuador</a>, <a>Peru</a>, <a>China</a>, <a>Vietnam</a>, <a>Iran</a>, <a>Romania</a> and <a>Russia</a>, <a>India</a> but some also from <a>Canada</a>, <a>Cuba</a>, <a>Singapore</a>, <a>Malaysia</a> and the <a>United States</a>.
Finally, some foreign students come for a single year from other top institutions in Europe and the United States.</p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>Four years of study are required for the engineering degree: one year of <a>military service</a> and scientific &quot;common trunk&quot; (respectively 8 months and 4 months), one year of pluridisciplinary studies, and one year of specialized studies (&#x201c;majors&#x201d;).
With the X2000 reform, a fourth year of studies, in another institution than Polytechnique, was introduced.</p>
<p>;First year The curriculum begins with 8 months during which French students undergo civilian or military service.
In the past, military service lasted 12 months and was compulsory for all French students; the suppression of the <a>draft</a> in France made this requirement of Polytechnique somewhat anachronistic, and the service was recast as a period of &#x201c;human and military formation&#x201d;.
All the French students spend one month together in <a>La Courtine</a> in a military training center.
By the end of this month, they are assigned either to a civilian service or to the <a>Army</a>, <a>Navy</a>, <a>Air Force</a> or <a>Gendarmerie</a>.
Students who are assigned to a military service complete a two-month military training in French officer schools such as <a>Saint-Cyr</a> or <a>&#x00c9;cole Navale</a>.
Finally, they are spread out over a wide range of units for a five month long assignment to a French military unit (which can include, but is not limited to, infantry and artillery regiments, naval ships and air bases).
While French students stay under military status during their studies at Polytechnique, and participate in a variety of ceremonies and other military events, for example national ceremonies, such as those of Bastille Day or anniversaries of the <a>armistice</a>s of the <a>World War</a>s, they do not undergo military training per se after having completed their service in the first year.
Ph.D. students generally work in the laboratories of the school; they may also work in external institutes or establishments that cannot, or will not, grant doctorates.</p>
<p>About 35% of Ph.D. students come from abroad.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
