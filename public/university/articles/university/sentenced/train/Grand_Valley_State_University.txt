<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Grand Valley State College accepted its first class of 226 students in 1963 and held its first graduation of 138 students on June 18, 1967.
The middle-late 1960s saw the addition of the first dormitories and construction of new academic buildings, including the Zumberge Library, named for the University's first President <a>James Zumberge</a>.
During the 1970s Grand Valley used a multiple college concept: &quot;College of Arts and Sciences&quot;, &quot;Thomas Jefferson College&quot;, &quot;William James College&quot;, &quot;Seidman College of Business&quot;, and &quot;College IV&quot;.
Former Michigan Governor <a>William Milliken</a> signed into law for the name to be changed to Grand Valley State Colleges in 1973.
However the &quot;s&quot; was dropped and the name was reverted back to Grand Valley State College in 1983 when the academic programs were reorganized into divisions.
The 1980s and 1990s saw addition of satellite campuses or centers in downtown Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Holland and Traverse City.
In 2004, the Board of Control reorganized the University structure again into a college system consisting of College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Interdisciplinary Studies, College of Community and Public Service, College of Education, College of Health Professions, Kirkhof College of Nursing, Seidman College of Business, and Seymour and Esther Padnos College of Engineering and Computing.
The fall semester of 2010 begins a year-long celebration of the university's first 50 years of history and change.</p>
<h3>Allendale campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|One of GVSU's first buildings and part of the Great Lakes Complex -Lake Michigan Hall.</a>
The University's main and original campus in Allendale is the location of most of the university's programs.
The Allendale campus is composed of 1,280 <a>acre</a>s perched above the <a>Grand River</a> next to a system of <a>ravine</a>s and is divided into two areas, north and south campus, separated in the middle by West Campus Drive.
State highway <a>M-45</a> links the campus in suburban Allendale to <a>US Highway 31</a>/<a>Lake Michigan</a> to the west and <a>Grand Rapids, Michigan</a> to the east.
<a>Lubbers Stadium</a>, the <a>GVSU Fieldhouse</a> and all other athletic facilities for the school's 19 varsity sports are also located on the Allendale campus.
The campus is dotted with many sculptures including Dale Eldred, Joseph Kinnebrew and <a>James Clover</a>.
Academic facilities on the Allendale campus include: 122 classrooms, 144 research laboratories, 20 lab prep rooms, 21 computer labs, and the Zumberge Library.</p>
<h3>Muskegon centers</h3>
<p>GVSU has three locations in Muskegon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>James L. Stevenson Center for Higher Education at <a>Muskegon Community College</a> was established in the fall of 1995 as a joint venture between GVSU, <a>Ferris State University</a>, and <a>Western Michigan University</a>.</li>
<li>Lake Michigan Center, which houses the <a>Annis Water Resources Institute</a> (AWRI).</li>
<li>The <a>Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center</a> (MAREC), which is the first fully integrated demonstration facility for distributed generation of electricity using alternative and renewable energy technologies in the United States.</li>

<h3>Public safety</h3>
<p>The Department of Public Safety provides law enforcement services for the Allendale Campus.
While the department is self-empowered to enforce its jurisdiction, officers are also deputized by the <a>Ottawa County</a> <a>Sheriff</a>'s Department.
Because <a>Allendale</a> doesn't have its own police department, the Grand Valley State University Police can handle cases anywhere in Ottawa County, mainly in Allendale and the area surrounding the campus.
The department handles other security issues, such as parking and driving violations, community policing, and lost and found.
Allendale's volunteer fire department serves the campus.
The Department of Public Safety also employs several students who assist the department by performing a variety of clerical and security based duties and services.</p>
<p>The Pew Campus Security and Regional Centers is an entity distinct from the Department of Public safety, and handles security and public safety issues for the Grand Rapids Pew Campus and all Regional Centers including the Holland (MI) Meijer Campus, the Muskegon (MI) campus and the Traverse City (MI) campus.
This department is not sworn or certified and relies on the Grand Rapids Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies for official law enforcement when necessary.</p>
