<p><strong>APIIT</strong>, the <strong>Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology</strong>, is an educational organisation specializing in providing education and training programmes in computing and <a>Information Technology</a>.
Founded by Datuk Dr Parmjit Singh and based originally in <a>Malaysia</a>, APIIT has since established other centres including <a>Pakistan</a>, <a>India</a>, and <a>Sri Lanka</a>.
The Institute works in collaboration with selected universities in the <a>United Kingdom</a> and has produced more than 14,000 graduates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>APIIT was founded in 1993 as part of an initiative by the Malaysian Government to address the shortage of <a>IT Professional</a>s in the country.
The newly formed Institute was based in <a>Damansara</a> Heights, <a>Kuala Lumpur</a>, and offered <a>Diploma</a> courses in computing and IT.</p>
<p>In the following year, co-operative links were established with <a>Monash University</a> in Australia, leading to the launch of a twinning programme in 1995 for <a>Bachelor's degree</a>s.
This was followed in 1996 by a twinning relationship with <a>Staffordshire University</a> in UK for <a>Master's degree</a> courses.</p>
<p>Expansion led to the opening of the Kuala Lumpur city campus in 1997, followed by campuses in <a>Karachi</a>, <a>Pakistan</a> (1998), <a>Colombo</a>, <a>Sri Lanka</a> (2000), <a>Lahore</a>, <a>Pakistan</a> (2000), <a>Panipat</a>, <a>India</a> (2001) and <a>Perth</a>, <a>Australia</a> (2004).
In 2003 the Malaysian campus moved to new premises at <a>Technology Park Malaysia</a>, where it is now known as <em>APIIT TPM</em>.</p>
<p>The curriculum has developed, with the Institute becoming a <a>SUN</a> and <a>Microsoft</a> authorised training centre in 1998, a <a>SAP</a> University Alliance Partner in 1999, and a Microsoft Certified Technical Education Centre in 2001.
APIIT gained University College status in 2004.
The Institute and its students have won numerous awards.
It has a very good reputation.</p>
<p>APIIT Smart School was founded by the Sapura Group in 2007.</p>

<h2>APIIT TPM, Malaysia</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Missing image removed: <a>right|thumb|250px|APIIT TPM</a> --&gt; The Malaysia campus (at ) is a purpose-built complex in <a>Technology Park Malaysia</a>, about 20&nbsp;km south of Kuala Lumpur centre, close to the suburb of <a>Bukit Jalil</a> and the <a>National Sports Complex</a>.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>The basic building for classes houses lecture rooms, auditoria, a multi-purpose hall, offices, discussion rooms, social space, cafeteria, library, computer labs, and research and development facilities.
The library affords access to eJournals and databases, some by arrangement with <a>Staffordshire University</a>.
The cafeteria is open to both APIIT students and to employees from other companies in the Technology Park.</p>
<p>Student accommodation is available locally in <em><a>Vista Komanwel</a> Condominiums</em> and <em>Arena Green Apartments</em>, and a shuttle bus runs between these and the campus.
Initiative students may also go for alternatives by renting an apartment themselves, which saves them more money during the period of study.
7-Eleven in Arena Green apartments do have a posting board for apartment and car-park rentals, usually ranges from RM700 - RM850 per unit depending on facilities provided by the unit's tenant.</p>
<h3>Transport links</h3>
<p>The campus is close to <a>Bukit Jalil LRT station</a> for electric-trains to various parts of Kuala Lumpur.
It has excellent road links, being close to the main PLUS <a>North-South Expressway</a>, the KESAS <a>Shah Alam Expressway</a> and the LDP <a>Puchong-Sungai Besi Highway</a>.</p>
