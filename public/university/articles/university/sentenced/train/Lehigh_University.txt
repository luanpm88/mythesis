<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Asa Packer.jpg|right|thumb|215px|[[Asa
Packer]]]]  <a>Asa Packer</a> named his university 'Lehigh' after his other passion, <a>the railroad</a>, despite suggestions from some to call it 'Packer University'.
It was founded to provide a well-rounded education for young men, combining a <a>liberal</a> and <a>scientific</a> education with the technical skills necessary to increase the prosperity of the region.
According to <a>William Bacon Stevens</a>, the first president of the board of trustees, Asa Packer's founding gift of $500,000 was the largest single endowment for a literary institution at that time.
This, plus its blend of engineering and liberal arts, attracted some of the nation's brightest students, many of whom went on to distinguished careers in industry and engineering.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering schools of the day, Lehigh was envisioned as a university instead of an &quot;institute of technology,&quot; offering an education that was rooted in both scientific and classical traditions as espoused by <a>John Amos Comenius</a>.
a College of Business &amp; Economics was added in 1910.
Lehigh's business curriculum was unique</p>
<h3>The Clery Act</h3>
<p> On April 5, 1986, 19-year-old Lehigh freshman Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in her dorm room and the culprit was later sentenced to death.
It was later disclosed that between 1982 to 1985 there had been 38 violent crimes at the university.
The victim's parents then settled a civil suit out of court with the university for an undisclosed amount.
The backlash of unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.
The Clery Act requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses.</p>

<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p> Nearly all of Lehigh's fraternities and sororities have their own houses which are owned by the university; most of the fraternities and sororities are located on the &quot;Hill&quot; along Upper and Lower Sayre Park Roads.
Approximately 34% of undergraduates are members of a Greek organization.
There are currently 23 fraternities, 18 of which are on campus, and 9 sororities, 8 of which are on campus:</p>

<h2>Spirit and traditions</h2>
<p>Lehigh students have several lasting traditions: Lehigh's school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper of the same name was first published in 1894.</p>
<p>Following the death of Asa Packer in May 1879, the University established &quot;Founder's Day&quot; to be held in October  to remember and recognize those have contributed to the success of the University.
The event remains an annual tradition.</p>
<p>Freshmen are traditionally inducted into the University in a convocation in the <a>Zoellner Arts Center</a> and welcomed at a Freshman-Alumni Rally where their class flag is given to them by the class from fifty years before.</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, freshmen wore small brown hats with their class numbers called &quot;dinks&quot; from the beginning of the fall semester until the Lafayette football game.
The week leading up to the big game was full of festivities created to unite the students and fuel spirit.
In one of these events, &quot;The Pajama Parade,&quot; the freshmen were led across the penny toll bridge in their pajamas singing &quot;We Pay No Tolls Tonight&quot; to the <a>Moravian College</a> dormitories where they would serenade the women.
The week before the game still involves decoration of the Greek houses, a bonfire, parties, rallies and the Marching 97 performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.</p>
<p>While the riots to rip down the goal posts in Taylor Stadium are a thing of the past, many alumni return for the Lafayette game (which is usually sold out three months in advance) to root Lehigh on, to attend parties at their former fraternities and sororities, and to see old friends.</p>
