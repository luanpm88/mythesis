<p>The <strong>University of North Carolina at Wilmington</strong> , commonly referred to as <strong>UNCW</strong> (sometimes known as <strong>UNC Wilmington</strong>) is a public, coeducational <a>university</a> located in <a>Wilmington, North Carolina</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school opened its doors on September 4, 1947 as Wilmington College.
At the time the school operated as a junior college, offering freshman-level courses to 250 students during the first school year, and was under control of the <a>New Hanover County</a> Board of Education.
Wilmington College earned accreditation from the North Carolina College Conference in 1948 and became a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges.
Further accreditation came in 1952 when the institution was so honored by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>
<p>In 1958 Wilmington College was placed under the Community College Act of North Carolina, thereby passing control from the New Hanover County Board of Education to a board of trustees.
The college was now state-supported and under the supervision of the North Carolina Board of Higher Education.</p>
<p>Wilmington College became a senior college on July 1, 1963, when the <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> passed legislation allowing the school to offer a four-year curriculum and award bachelor's degrees.
Six years later, July 1, 1969, the name of the school was changed to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, making UNCW the fifth campus of the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.
On August 22, 1977, UNCW was authorized to offer its first graduate programs at the master's level.
Currently, UNCW has more than 12,000 students enrolled and nearly 500 full-time faculty members.
The school offers seventy-three bachelor's degrees, thirty master's degrees, and two doctoral degrees.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Campus Life</h3>
<p>The wide variety of programs in <a>liberal arts</a>, <a>biological sciences</a>, <a>fine arts</a>, and the university&#x2019;s esteemed  film studies program draws a variety of undergraduate and graduate students from across the United States.
The proximity to <a>Wrightsville Beach</a> is witnessed as a primary draw for incoming freshman, though the allure dies down noticeably for upper classmen.</p>
<p><a>Teal</a> is the official school color of UNCW, with <a>navy</a> and <a>gold</a> as alternate colors.
The school color has become a point of pride for students, which is widely illustrated with spirit shirts bearing slogans such as &#x201c;Feel My Teal&#x201d; and exclusive teal-colored <a>Rainbow Sandals</a> being offered through the university bookstore.</p>
<p>In recent years, UNCW has progressed beyond its former reputation as a &#x201c;party school&#x201d;, and improved academics at the university have given it the appeal as a rising star in the public university system of North Carolina.
By 2010, the average <a>SAT</a> score for incoming freshman was 1170, with an average GPA of 3.8.</p>
<p>UNCW has struggled to diversify its student body, with only 11% of enrolled students referred to as &#x201c;Minority&#x201d;.
As such, the university has implemented a &#x201c;commitment to diversity&#x201d; as one of its &#x201c;strategic goals&#x201d;, and many on-campus events have been held in this pursuit.
However, this issue is somewhat offset by UNCW&#x2019;s impressive enrollment of female students, which make up nearly 60% of the student body.</p>
<h3>Student Facilities</h3>
<p>In 2000, the Student Recreation Center was opened to students, staff, and faculty members.
It houses three basketball courts, a host of exercise machines, a weight training area, an indoor running track, and an indoor <a>climbing wall</a>.
It also includes a group exercise room which supports multiple clubs and activities, including <a>Yoga</a>, <a>Pilates</a>, and an <a>Aikido</a> club.</p>
<p>Lumina Theater, named after the boardwalk theater that was once found on <a>Wrightsville Beach</a>, offers a professional movie theater experience to the UNCW community.
Opened in August 2006, the Lumina Theater features 360 stadium seats, a 15.5' x 30' screen, Dolby Digital surround sound, 35mm capabilities and a digital projection system.
Lumina screens blockbusters, independents, cult classics, art films, international films and student films throughout the academic year, four or more days a week, except during University holidays and breaks.
Some notable Lumina events included a multi-part, <a>high-definition</a> screening of BBC's <a>Planet Earth</a> series over the span of several weekends, and a yearly 24-hour lock-in.</p>
<h3>Residential Accommodation</h3>
<p><strong>Galloway Hall</strong> is the oldest dorm on the campus and has the typical arrangement of shared bathrooms for the entire hall.
Galloway is typically considered to be a <a>freshman</a> dorm and has a social atmosphere.
It underwent extensive renovations in 2006 and the elevators were renovated in 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Graham-Hewlett</strong> and <strong>Belk</strong> dormitories are configured in a suite-style arrangement with eight to ten individuals sharing a bathroom.
Belk is the only dorm on campus which is exclusively female, as all other dorms are coed.
Starting in 2008, Graham, Hewlett, and Belk Halls are arranged to hold additional students, with every other room housing three students (as opposed to the usual two).
This has been done to accommodate the increasingly larger freshmen classes and prevent outsourcing housing to local hotels, as was done in the past when housing was overbooked.</p>
<p>Constructed in the 1980s, <strong>Schwartz Hall</strong> has shared bathrooms but is distinguished by its unusual square layout in contrast with the typical hall style dorms.
One floor in Schwartz are designated as &quot;study floors&quot; and require the residents to abide by stricter regulations.</p>
<p>The newer dormitories include <strong>Honors</strong>, <strong>International</strong>, and <strong>Cornerstone Hall</strong> -- which are arranged with a courtyard between them to form what is referred to as &quot;<strong>Tri-house</strong>&quot;.
These dormitories were constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s and are considered to be the most luxurious and well-maintained freshmen residences on campus.</p>
<p>In addition to the dormitories, UNCW also has on campus apartments and suites.
There are 13 apartment buildings which can serve as home to 400 students.
The Apartments house 4 students, who all have separate bedrooms but share a bathroom, living room, and kitchen.
The apartments were extensively renovated in 2002 and now boast marble counter tops, tiled bathrooms, and new appliances.</p>
<p>The Suites, built in the late 1980s have two separate floor-plans which are divided by a breeze-way and set of stairs.
There are 7 suite buildings which can also house 400 students.
Each floor of the suites consists of a singles and doubles 'pod' The doubles pod consists of 6 bedrooms housing 12 students.
The singles pod consists of 10 private bedrooms housing 10 students.
All residents of the Suites share bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens.
As of 2008 the Suites have not been renovated.
Starting with the 07-08 school year, the suites now house various sororities and the apartments house fraternities in addition to their previous function of housing the university's sports teams.
The idea is for the suites and apartments to eventually become completely Greek.</p>
<p>The University has recently completed the construction of <strong>Seahawk Village</strong>, a luxury apartment complex designed to compete with off-campus accommodations.
Seahawk Village comprises six (6) apartment buildings and a club house with swimming pool.
The complex is constructed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style that is consistent with campus.
The Village includes a mix of 2,3, and 4 bedroom apartments with a total of (524) beds.
The apartments are fully furnished and provided with wireless internet, cable TV, and local telephone service.
They feature a full service kitchen and washer and dryer in each apartment.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2006, as a part of UNCW&#x2019;s initiative to expand on-campus housing for 40% of undergraduate students, the &#x201c;<strong>Seahawk Landing</strong>&#x201d; residence facility was opened, featuring living arrangements similar to that found in the Seahawk Village facility, with expanded amenities such as a sandwich/coffee shop, convenience market, and small-scale recreation facility located on local site.</p>
<p>In 2008, construction began on the third phase of this residential expansion, which has been dubbed &#x201c;<strong>Seahawk Crossing</strong>&#x201d;. Construction of these facilities, which includes the construction of a multi-level parking deck, involved leveling several acres of long-leaf pine forest, which promulgated a vociferous, but ultimately unheard student movement to block the destruction of what became known as &#x201c;fast times forest&#x201d;.
As of December 2008, extensive progress has been made on the site, and the facilities opened August 2009.</p>
<h3>Off-Campus Housing</h3>
<p>There are many apartments and condos that UNCW students live in.
The Seahawk Perch which is maintained by the Dean of Students Office ia avaliable to assist offcampus students.</p>
<h3>Campus Dining</h3>
<p>UNCW has several options for campus dining.
The primary venue for dining on campus is Wagoner Hall, which is referred to as the &quot;Wag&quot; by students.
Conversely, students suffering from gastric distress often blame it on a case of the &quot;Wags&quot;.
Wagoner Hall serves as a standard dining hall setup, with various stations offering a variety of foods, including a salad bar and assorted desserts.
Wagoner Hall is also host to &quot;Wagsgiving&quot;, an annual Thanksgiving feast arranged for students.</p>
<p>The newly renovated University Union now houses The Hawk's Nest where students can choose from: Jole Mole which serves Mexican cuisine, the Tuscan Oven which serves pizza and breadsticks, the Hawk Wok which serves Asian Cuisine including broth bowls and many other delicious dishes, the Varsity Grill which serves hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, there is a Sushi Station where you can custom make your sushi, Chick-fil-A and Quiznos.</p>
<p>As is typical with most college campuses, UNCW's dining services are entirely controlled by <a>Aramark</a>, whose contract demands the inclusion of meal plans in most, but not all, residential fees.</p>
<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p>Greek-letter societies are a part of the student life at UNCW.
Fraternities and Sororities continue to grow at UNCW with membership now above 10 percent of the overall student population, which exceeds the national average.
