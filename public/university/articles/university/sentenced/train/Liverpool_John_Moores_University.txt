<p>  <strong>Liverpool John Moores University</strong> (informally <strong>LJMU</strong>) is a <a>British</a> <a>'modern' university</a> located in the city of <a>Liverpool</a>, <a>England</a>.
The university is named after <a>John Moores</a> and was previously called Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts and later Liverpool Polytechnic before gaining university status in 1992, thus becoming Liverpool John Moores University.</p>
<p>The university is a member of the <a>University Alliance</a>, a mission group of British universities established in 2007.
It is also a member of the <a>European University Association</a> and the <a>North West Universities Association</a>.
At present, LJMU serves more than 24,000 students comprising 20,270 <a>undergraduate</a> students and 4,100 <a>postgraduate</a> students, making it the largest university in Liverpool by student population - as well as the <a>twentieth largest in the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Byrom Street City Campus</a></p>
<p>Originally founded as a small mechanics institution (Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts) in 1823, the institution grew over the centuries by converging and amalgamating with different colleges before eventually becoming Liverpool Polytechnic.
The University also has a long history of providing training, education and research to the maritime industry, dating back to the formation of the Liverpool Nautical College in 1892.
Today it is one of the leading maritime Universities in the UK.</p>
<p>The institution then became a university under the terms of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a> under the new title of &quot;Liverpool John Moores University&quot;.
This new title was approved by the <a>Privy Council</a> on 15 September 1992.
The university took its name from <a>Sir John Moores</a>, the founder of the <a>Littlewoods</a> empire.
Moores was a great believer in the creation of opportunity for all, which embodies the ethos of LJMU in providing educational routes for people of all ages and from all backgrounds.
This belief led Sir John Moores to invest in the institution and facilities, such as the <a>John Foster</a> Building (housing the <a>Liverpool Business School</a>), designed by and named after leading architect John Foster.</p>
<h3>Present day</h3>
<p>LJMU now has more than 24,000 students.
New advances in digital technology and science have placed the university at the forefront of exciting developments in areas such as multimedia, sports science and learning how to fly.
The advances in these subject areas led LJMU to be awarded the <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a> in 2005 which aims to recognise and reward the outstanding contribution that universities and colleges in the United Kingdom make to the intellectual, economic, cultural and social life of the nation.</p>
<p>Currently, Liverpool John Moores University is enjoying a boom in student numbers with the university receiving more applications than previously seen.
The university was recently placed at number 20 in the country for applications received in 2007, the total number of applications submitted to LJMU was 28,214.</p>
<p>On 14 April 2008, <a>Dr Brian May CBE</a> was inducted into the university as the fourth <a>Chancellor</a> of Liverpool John Moores University.
Dr May is also the lead guitarist for the rock band <a>Queen</a>.
He replaced outgoing Chancellor <a>Cherie Booth QC</a>, wife of former Prime Minister <a>Tony Blair</a>.
Honorary fellows in attendance at the ceremony included Sir <a>Patrick Moore</a> and <a>Pete Postlethwaite</a>.</p>
<p>LJMU is a founding member of the <a>Northern Consortium</a>, an educational charity, owned by eleven universities in the north of England.
Alongside LJMU, this group was co founded by The <a>University of Bradford</a>, The <a>University of Huddersfield</a>, <a>Leeds Metropolitan University</a>, The <a>University of Leeds</a>, The <a>University of Liverpool</a>, <a>Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, The <a>University of Manchester</a>, The <a>University of Salford</a>, <a>Sheffield Hallam University</a> and The <a>University of Sheffield</a>.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The university is based primarily on three campuses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>City Campus, housing buildings from many faculties in and around Liverpool city centre</li>
  <li>Mount Pleasant Campus, close to the city centre, home to the <a>faculty of Business and Law</a></li>
  <li><a>I M Marsh Campus</a>, in <a>Aigburth</a> housing the Education, Community and Leisure faculty</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future/Recent projects</h3>
<p>The university is currently expanding and improving numerous buildings on the three campus sites: the latest project will be the new &#x00a3;20 million Byrom Street development.
Once completed in 2009, it will enable the university to consolidate science teaching to one location.
Around 50 per cent of the new building's 6,400 square metre floorspace will be given over to specialist teaching and research laboratories, with the remainder being used for teaching, IT suites and staff accommodation.
LJMU's School of Sport and Exercise Sciences is ranked as the United Kingdom's number one for both teaching and research in this field.
The specialist facilities housed within the new building reflect the School's elite status and will include an indoor 70-metre running track and labs for testing cardio-vascular ability, motor skills and bio-mechanics functions.
The building will also have additional biochemistry and psychology teaching labs.</p>
<p>Another major addition to the university is the Art and Design Academy, which replaced the previous disparate locations of the department.
The &#x00a3;21.4 million development opened in 2008 to coincide with the <a>European Capital of Culture</a> bid which was won by Liverpool and is based at the Mount Pleasant campus.</p>
<h3>Guest speakers</h3>
<p>LJMU hosts guest lectures on occasion, with past speakers including the <a>Dalai Lama</a>, <a>Steven Spielberg</a>, <a>Willy Russell</a>, <a>Phil Redmond</a>, <a>Alastair Campbell</a>, and <a>Baron</a>ess <a>Shirley Williams</a> of <a>Crosby</a>.
The latest guest speakers were <a>United States Senator</a> <a>George J. Mitchell</a>,  <a>Michael Heseltine</a> <a>CH</a>, <a>PC</a>,   and <a>Next</a> clothing retailer <a>George Davies</a>.

<h3>LSU Media</h3>
<p><em>The Looprevil Press</em> is a student newspaper at Liverpool Students' Union.
It is both a student society and a part of the student media.
As of May 2009, The Looprevil Press has been funded by the Liverpool Students' Union.
<em>The Looprevil Press</em> was founded in September 2008 by student Shamit Patel and is currently the only student newspaper in circulation in Liverpool.
The LP offices are located on the second floor of the Haigh building.</p>
<p>The name, The Looprevil Press, is simply Liverpool spelled backwards and plays in with their tag line of &#x201c;Bringing you the other side of Liverpool&#x201d;.
This was done in an attempt to reflect the duality of student life, to show that they can be both professional and a little eccentric of nature.</p>
<p>The Looprevil Press started out as a dynamic website which contains four sections; News, Opinion, Entertainment and Sports.
The current team consists of 29 members and is made up of writers, photographers and a web designer.
The website is active throughout the year while the print edition is circulated four times during the academic year.</p>
<p>The union also has a radio station called Looprevil Radio which is run by students Adam Rickwood and Chris Mather.</p>
<h2>Halls of residence</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Liverpool John Moores University over recent years has sold off a number of previously University owned halls of residence.
North Western Hall, formerly the <a>North Western Hotel</a>, built by <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a> in 1871, was sold to Cosmopolitan Student Homes in 2004.
The hall is situated conveniently between the City and Mount Pleasant campuses.</p>
<p>Two of the most popular halls for students studying at the City Campus are Atlantic Point and Marybone.
Both of these can be found within a few hundred metres of major University buildings.
Many <a>IM Marsh</a> students reside in the accommodation provided on campus in <a>Aigburth</a> but others choose to live in the city-centre.
Two of the most popular halls for students based in the Mount Pleasant Campus are Grand Central (for its location close to the university and city centre) and Cambridge Court (for its close proximity to the buildings of the Business Faculty and LJMU's new Art &amp; Design Academy).
