Professor <a>Glyn Davis</a> <a>AC</a> is Melbourne's current <a>vice-chancellor</a>.</p>
<h2>Arms</h2>
<p>The university's coat of arms is a blue shield on which a depiction of Victory in white colour holds her laurel wreath over the stars of the Southern Cross.
The motto is written on a scroll beneath the shield,  <em>Postera crescam laude</em> (&quot;Later I shall grow by praise&quot; or, more freely, &quot;We shall grow in the esteem of future generations&quot;) The Latin is from a line in a <a>Horace</a> ode: <em>ego postera crescam laude recens</em>.
The arms include no crest or supporters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|230px|Cussonia Court, home to the Schools of Classics and Philosophy.</a></p>
<p>Melbourne University was established by <a>Hugh Childers</a> by an 1853 act of the Victorian Parliament.
Classes commenced in 1855 with three professors and sixteen students; of this body of students, only four  graduated.
The original buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir <a>Charles Hotham</a>, on 3 October 1855.
The first chancellor, <a>Redmond Barry</a> (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880.</p>
<p>In the university's early days, an architectural master-plan was developed, establishing the intended prevailing building style as <a>gothic revival</a>.
Early influential architects included Melbourne's own <a>Joseph Reed</a>, who was responsible for the design of many of the early campus buildings.
Although the master-plan was followed until the 1930s, the 1950s saw the modernist style established as a new &quot;house style&quot;, resulting in the mix of university buildings seen today.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the university was made possible by the wealth resulting from <a>Victoria's gold rush</a>.
The institution was designed to be a &quot;civilising influence&quot; at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth (Selleck, 2003).
It was designated secular and excluded from offering degrees in <a>divinity</a> - the churches could establish colleges on only the northern perimeter.
The local population largely rejected the supposed elitism of its professoriate, favouring teaching of 'useful' subjects like law, over those they deemed 'useless' in the city's context, like <a>classics</a>.
The townspeople won this debate, and law was introduced in 1857, and medicine and engineering in the 1860s.</p>
<p>The admission of women in 1881 was a further victory for Victorians over the more conservative ruling council (Selleck 2003, p 164&#x2013;165).
Subsequent years saw many tensions over the direction of the emerging university and, in 1902, it was effectively bankrupt following the discovery of a &#x20a4;24,000 fraudulent defalcation by the university's bursar, Frederick Dickson, over the period 1886-1901 (when the yearly grant was &#x00a3;15,000).
Dickson was jailed for seven years.</p>
<p>This resulted in a royal commission that recommended new funding structures, and an extension of disciplinary areas into agriculture and education.</p>
<p>By the time of <a>World War I</a>, governance was again a pressing concern.
The Council, consisting of more businesspeople than professors, obtained real powers in 1923 at the expense of the Senate.
Undergraduates could elect two members of the Council.
In this period, students tended to be drawn from affluent backgrounds, with a few opportunities for gifted scholarship students.
The first vice-chancellor to be paid a salary was <a>Raymond Priestley</a> (1936) followed by John Medley in 1939.</p>
<p>After <a>World War II</a>, demand for Commonwealth-funded student places grew in Australia, and the university catered for the demand, becoming much larger and more inclusive.</p>
<p>The 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2003.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>Governance of the university is grounded in an act of parliament, the <a>Melbourne University Act 1958</a>.
The peak governing body is the <em>Council,</em> whose key responsibilities include appointing the Vice Chancellor and Principal, approving the strategic direction and annual budget, establishing operational policies and procedures, and overseeing academic and commercial activities as well as risk management.
The chair of the Council is the <em>Chancellor</em>.
The <em>Academic Board</em> oversees learning, teaching and research activities, and provides advice to the Council on these matters.
The <em>Committee of Convocation</em> represents graduates, and its members are elected in proportion to the number of graduates in each faculty.</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>In 2008, the university had an endowment of approximately $1.105 billion, Whilst the fund had grown rapidly for several years, providing up to $100 million of income per year, some of which incorporate a graduate school.
It also has an affiliation with the <a>Melbourne Business School</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Professor <a>Peter C. Doherty</a> is a <a>Nobel Laureate</a> based in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology as well as being the College Visitor at <a>Janet Clarke Hall</a>.
Sir <a>James Mirrlees</a> (Economic Science, 1996 - emeritus, Cambridge) and Sir <a>Clive Granger</a> (Economic Science, 2003 - emeritus, San Diego) both taught at the university from 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p>Melbourne has produced the most <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> of any Victorian university, including the two 2006 winners.</p>
<p>The numbers of international students have grown from 2,000 in 1996 to over 11,000 in 2008.
A separate venture, <a>Melbourne University Private</a> was created in 1997, and merged with the university at the end of 2005 following the easing of Commonwealth regulations to allow domestic full-fee places in Australian universities.</p>
<p>[[File:International student enrolments.png[|right|thumb|600px|The

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The Melbourne University Library is one of the busiest <a>libraries</a> in Australia, with three million visitors performing 42 million loan transactions every year.
The general collection comprises over 3.5 million items including books, DVDs, photographic slides, music scores, periodicals, as well as rare maps, prints and other published materials.
The university has a node of the <a>Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics</a>.</p>
<h2>Arts and culture</h2>
<p>The university is associated with a number of arts institutions in the wider community.
These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Melbourne Theatre Company</a>, the oldest professional <a>theatre company</a> in Australia and one of the largest theatre companies in the English-speaking world.
The company is a semi-autonomous department of the university.</li>
<li>The <a>Ian Potter Museum of Art</a>, which houses the university's visual arts collection.</li>
<li><a>Melbourne University Publishing</a> (formally Melbourne University Press), an academic press which has since diversified into multimedia production as well as books and monographs.</li>
<li><a>Meanjin</a>, an Australian literary journal.</li>
<li>Thirty-three cultural collections, embodying the history of many of the academic disciplines taught at the university.
These include the <a>Grainger Museum</a> Collection of musical cultural artifacts; the Medical History Museum, covering the history of the medical profession in Victoria; and the Harry Brookes Allen Museum of Anatomy and Pathology, which contains more than 8,000 specimens relevant to the teaching of medicine and other health sciences.</li>
<li><a>The Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation</a> is the only centre of its kind in Australia, combining both theory and practice of cultural material conservation and is a joint initiative of the <a>Faculty of Arts</a>, <a>Faculty of Science</a> and the Ian Potter Museum of Art.</li>
  <li>The Melbourne University is host to the <a>Future Problem Solving Program Australia</a> (FPSPA) national finals every even year.
This is held during mid-October and participants from across Australia attend the University of Melbourne for competition.
The Grand Buffet Hall and the Copeland Theatre are the two main locations for ceremonies and competition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&quot;Growing Esteem&quot; project</h2>
<h3>New strategy</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2005, the university developed a new strategy, 'Growing Esteem', incorporating strands of Research, Teaching and Learning, and Knowledge Transfer.
Within the teaching and learning strand is the <a>Melbourne Model</a>, a curriculum-depth-of-content discipline partly based on the undergraduate experience at first-tier universities of the United States.
The six 'New Generation degrees' of Science, Biomedicine, Environments, Arts, Music and Commerce are designed to lead to graduation and the workplace, graduate degrees focusing on the professions, or research-oriented higher degrees.
The new structure was introduced in 2008, with faculties governing courses in law, medicine, education and architecture establishing graduate schools to administer Master's degrees.
PhD candidatures are generally administered through the School of Graduate Research.</p>

--&gt;Some students and members of the wider community have been critical of the Growing Esteem (or <a>Melbourne Model</a>) project, which has come under much scrutiny in the Australian press.
The university offers a minimum of 50% of the places in each of the new professional graduate degrees  - 100% for education and nursing - for domestic Australian students as <a>Commonwealth Supported Place</a>s, with the University aiming for 75% across all the new courses.
The ability to offer Commonwealth Supported Places to postgraduate students is a first for an Australian university, heralding a new approach to diversity in the higher-education sector by the <a>Howard government</a> and the succeeding <a>Rudd government</a>.</p>
<p>Some have also raised issues about the proposed alterations to how research is funded, with a growing dependence on private industry monies being mooted.</p>
<p>Youth Allowance and Austudy has been extended to Commonwealth-approved Master's degrees by coursework programmes.
20% of places in the new degrees will be allocated to the 'Access Melbourne' programme.</p>
<h3>New courses</h3>
<p>Six courses have been approved as 'new generation undergraduate courses': generalist degrees under the 'Melbourne Model'.
These degrees will eventually replace 96 undergraduate degrees.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bachelor of Arts</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Science</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Commerce</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Environments</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Music</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Biomedicine</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) has been discontinued; instead becoming the graduate degree Juris Doctor (JD) as of 2008.
In addition, several existing courses will continue in 2008, such as medicine, veterinary science and some engineering degrees.
The university anticipates that all professional courses (including engineering, medicine, dentistry, optometry and veterinary science) will change from undergraduate to graduate-entry by 2011.</p>
<p>A number of professional courses will be moved to graduate entry including: <img></p>
<ul>
  <li>Juris Doctor</li>
  <li>Doctor of Medicine</li>
  <li>Doctor of Dental Surgery</li>
  <li>Doctor of Optometry</li>
  <li>Doctor of Physiotherapy</li>
  <li>Doctor of Veterinary Medicine</li>
  <li>Master of Animal Science</li>
  <li>Master of Architecture</li>
  <li>Master of Engineering</li>
  <li>Master of Forest Science</li>
  <li>Master of Nursing Science</li>
  <li>Master of Property and Construction</li>
  <li>Master of Public Policy and Management</li>
  <li>Master of Social Work</li>
  <li>Master of Teaching</li>
  <li>Master of Urban Horticulture</li>
  <li>Master of Urban Planning</li>
</ul>
<p><img></p>
<h3>Criticisms of the 'Melbourne Model'</h3>
<p>Various groups, including trade and student unions,   a handful of academics,  and some students have expressed criticism of the Melbourne Model, citing job and subject cuts, and a risk of 'dumbing down' content.
A group of students also produced a <a>satirical musical</a> regarding the matter.</p>
<h4>VCA controversy</h4>
<p>The university's 2007 acquisition of the <a>Victorian College of the Arts</a> and subsequent plans to introduce the &quot;Melbourne Model&quot; at the campus has attracted much attention and criticism within the wider community.
As of May 2009 the university has 'suspended' the Bachelor of Music Theatre and Puppetry courses at the College and there are fears that they may not return under the Melbourne Model.</p>
<p>A 2005 heads of agreement over the merger of the VCA and the university stated that the management of academic programs at the VCA will ensure that, &quot;the VCA continues to exercise high levels of autonomy over the conduct and future development of its academic programs so as to ensure their integrity and quality,&quot; and also that the college's identity will be preserved.
New dean Sharman Pretty outlined drastic changes under the university's plan for the college in early April 2009.
As a result it is now being called into question whether the university have upheld that agreement.</p>
<p>Staff at the college have responded to the changes, claiming that the university does not value vocational arts training, and voicing fears over the future of quality training at the VCA.
Former Victorian arts minister Race Matthews has also weighed in on the debate expressing his hope that, &quot;Melbourne University will not proceed with its proposed changes to the Victorian College of the Arts,&quot; and for 'good sense' to prevail.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of Melbourne University rankings: </p>
<p>The University of Melbourne has been consistently ranked top 100 universities worldwide by both the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ARWU) and Times Higher Education since their publication.
The <a>Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan</a> (HEEACT) has also ranked Melbourne University ahead of any other Universities in the southern hemisphere and placed it in the top 100 worldwide (together with Sydney University) since its publication.</p>
<p>With regard to rankings by broad subjects, The University of Melbourne has been consistently ranked top 100 worldwide for biomedicine, life and agriculture science, business, law, education, engineering, arts and humanities and social sciences, according to Times Higher Education, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ARWU), The <a>Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan</a> (HEEACT) and the Melbourne Institute.
Moreover, Melbourne University is the only one Australian institution ranked top 30 worldwide across all subjects by Times Higher Education 2009.
This prominent position is also confirmed by 3 other ranking systems, with Melbourne possessing more academic disciplines ranked top 100 in the world than any other Australian institutions.</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Research produced by the <em>Melbourne Institute</em> in 2006 ranked Australian universities across seven main discipline areas: Arts &amp; Humanities, Business &amp; Economics, Education, Engineering, Law, Medicine, and Science, with Melbourne University as the highest in business, law and medicine by both academic surveys and overall performance.
It is to be noted that the Melbourne Institute's rankings are ignored within Australia as performance indicators in academia by prominent universities such as ANU, Sydney, Queensland and Monash, as none of these prominent universities feature or utilize these rankings as performance indicators.
University of Melbourne has also been known to infer over-representation of performance with rankings.
As such, the Melbourne Institute's rankings are not widely supported or endorsed by any major university in Australia.
Without academic consensus, it is generally thought that they do not offer a good independent indicator of performance within academia.
&#x0009;University of Melbourne is the best university in Australia and 40th university in the world.</p>

<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Total enrolment at the university by sex, 1915-2005.</a>
The university student life is reflected by the variety of clubs and services funded by the <a>University of Melbourne Student Union</a>.
Student extracurricular activities generally come under the loose umbrella of the University of Melbourne Student Union, student sporting activities under the Sports Union, and postgraduate students at University of Melbourne Graduate Student Association (a member of the <a>Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations</a>).
Many student clubs are affiliated with UMSU, as well as student theatre and the official student newspaper, <a>Farrago</a>.
A scandal engulfed the Union in 2003, eventually leading to its collapse, liquidation and subsequent rebirth as a new entity.
However, given the introduction of <a>Voluntary Student Unionism</a> from the 1 July 2006, services and activities offered by this new Union have diminished.
The shortfall in funding from declining membership has been offset to an extent by a recurrent grant from the university.</p>
