<p> <strong>Villanova University</strong> is a private university located in <a>Radnor Township</a>, a suburb northwest of <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, in the <a>United States</a>.
Named for <a>Saint Thomas of Villanova</a>, the school is the oldest  <a>Catholic</a> university in the <a>Commonwealth</a> of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Founded in 1842 by the <a>Order of Saint Augustine</a>, the university traces its roots to <a>old Saint Augustine's Church</a>, Philadelphia, which the Augustinian friars founded in 1796, and to its parish school, Saint Augustine's Academy, which was established in 1811.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250|right|Villanova College in 1849</a> In October 1841, two <a>Augustinian friars</a> from Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia purchased the  &quot;Belle Air&quot; estate in Radnor Township with the intention of starting a school.
The school, which was called the &quot;Augustinian College of Villanova,&quot; opened in 1842.
However, the <a>Philadelphia Nativist Riots</a> of 1844 that burned Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia caused financial difficulties for the Augustinians, and the college was closed in February 1845.
The college reopened in 1846 and graduated its first class in 1847.
In March 1848, the governor of Pennsylvania incorporated the school and gave it the power to grant degrees.
In 1859, the first master's degree was conferred on a student.
In 1857, the school closed again as the demand for priests in Philadelphia prevented adequate staffing, and the crisis of the <a>Panic of 1857</a> strained the school financially.
The school remained closed throughout the Civil War and reopened in September 1865; since then it has operated continuously.</p>
<p>The first great expansion of Villanova began in the late 1890s.
Desiring an institution that would &quot;rank among the best in the United States,&quot; the college built more classrooms, dormitories, and recreational facilities, and bought instructional equipment.</p>
<p>The School of Technology was established in 1905.
In 1915, a two-year pre-medical program was established to help students meet medical schools' new requirements.
This led to a four-year pre-medical program, the B.S. in biology, and the founding of the sciences division in 1926.<a>thumb|upright|left|Corr
Hall from The Grotto</a></p>
<p>Villanova was all-male until 1918, when the college began evening classes to educate <a>nun</a>s to teach in <a>parochial school</a>s.
In 1938, a laywoman received a Villanova degree for the first time.
It was not until the nursing school opened in 1953 that women permanently began attending Villanova full-time.
In 1958, the College of Engineering admitted its first female student; other colleges admitted women only as commuters.
Villanova University became fully coeducational in 1968.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, Villanova worked to become a nationally recognized university.
The quality of faculty and students improved dramatically and international studies programs were introduced.
Additional residential and recreational facilities were constructed, and efforts to increase the <a>endowment</a> were undertaken.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, endowed chairs were established in <a>theology</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, <a>engineering</a>, and <a>business</a>; scholarship funding was increased, and the curriculum expanded and improved.
An extensive building campaign created facilities for the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Commerce and Finance, and student residences on the south and the west campuses.
In 1985, the school also won the Men's NCAA basketball tournament, giving the school increased national exposure.</p>
<p>Over the history of the university, it has also served as a headquarters of the <a>Order of Saint Augustine</a> in North America, and has provided staff to establish Catholic high schools throughout the United States, such as <a>St.
Augustine High School</a> in <a>San Diego, California</a>, which was established in 1922 with teaching staff dispatched from Villanova.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|right|St.
Thomas of Villanova Chapel, on the Villanova University campus.</a>
Villanova University sits on  just  from <a>Philadelphia</a>.
The campus was formerly known as <a>Arboretum Villanova</a> which includes roughly 1,500 trees across campus, including the only known instance of a naturally-growing <a>sequoia</a> east of the Mississippi River.
Official Arboretum status has been revoked due to the university's lack of upkeep to Arboretum rules and standards such as the planting of new trees and the offering of tours.
There are three named areas on the campus, all within easy walking distance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main Campus contains most of the educational buildings, administration buildings, Student Center, Library, Bookstore, the Villanova Chapel, the main cafeteria along with a variety of coffee shops and eateries, the newly built Athletic Center as well as the Pavilion and Villanova Stadium, and many freshmen, sophomore and junior student residences.</li>
<li>West Campus contains the Law School, St. Mary's hall (a large building for single housing, a cafeteria, classrooms, indoor swimming pool, market, etc.) some administrative buildings, and housing for juniors as well as some seniors who are permitted to live on campus.
Also included are basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields, volleyball courts and <a>barbecue</a> pits.
The SEPTA Paoli/Thorndale station - Villanova is also located here.
There is also the Law School parking garage in addition to apartment parking.</li>
<li>South Campus contains 7 freshman and sophomore residence halls, Donohue Court (South Campus Cafeteria) and Donohue Market (South Campus Market).
The <a>SEPTA Route 100</a> line has a stop right behind Stanford Hall.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|300px|right|A panoramic view of the Main Campus in early spring</a> The most prominent feature of the Villanova campus is <a>St.
Thomas of Villanova Church</a>, whose dual spires are Villanova's tallest structure.
The cornerstone for the church was laid in 1883, with construction continuing until 1887.
The church underwent major renovations in 1943 and 1992.
It is built in <a>Gothic Revival style</a> .
The church lies at the head of the path crossing <a>Lancaster Avenue</a> into the parking lots and toward South Campus.
As such, it is a popular meeting place for students, and hosts three student-oriented masses on Sunday nights at 6:00PM, 8:00PM, and 10:00PM.
The church is also home to St. Thomas of Villanova Parish, whose Masses take place Sunday morning.
The stained-glass windows of the church depict the life of <a>St.
Augustine of Hippo</a>.
<a>thumb|left|St.
Thomas of Villanova Monastery</a> Situated behind the Church is Mendel Field, around which sit six major campus buildings: Mendel Hall, Tolentine Hall, White Hall, Falvey Hall, John Barry Hall, and the Chemical Engineering Building.
Mendel Hall, named for pioneering <a>geneticist</a> and Augustinian monk <a>Gregor Mendel</a>, holds science labs, lecture halls, and other facilities.
Mendel Hall's two large buildings are connected underground and by a second-floor indoor bridge that forms the gateway between West and Main Campus.
In 1998, the college commissioned a  <a>bronze sculpture</a> of Mendel by Philadelphia <a>sculptor</a> <a>James Peniston</a>, and installed it outside the hall's entrance.
Tolentine Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus, houses classrooms, academic offices such as the Registrar's Office and the Office of the President, and computer labs, and is connected to Villanova's monastery, St. Thomas Hall.  White Hall, consisting mainly of classrooms and laboratories, is directly connected to the Chemical Engineering Building, which was built in 1947.
&quot;Old Falvey&quot; is the <a>annex</a> of the Falvey Memorial Library, named for Rev. Daniel Falvey who served as librarian from 1940 until his death in 1962.
It is home to some classrooms in the Art History and Education departments as well as some offices, along with The Math Center, The Writing Center, and The Augustinian Heritage Institute, and the Matthew J. Ryan Center, a division of the Political Science Department.
John Barry Hall, named for naval officer <a>Commodore John Barry</a>, houses the Navy ROTC Program.
To the West of the Church, the Center for Engineering Education and Research (CEER), which opened in 1998, holds engineering labs, engineering classrooms, an engineering computer lab, and an auditorium hall for projections and slideshows.</p>
<p>Slightly east of Mendel Field sits The Grotto, a landscaped haven between Falvey Library and two residence halls: Alumni Hall, home to the Service Learning Community; and Corr Hall, the location of the Center for Peace and Justice Studies.
Often home to outdoor <a>mass</a>es and other large gatherings, the Grotto is sometimes perfect for quiet contemplation.
The grotto includes a statue depicting <a>Our Lady of Good Counsel</a> and plaques dedicated to the veterans of <a>World War II</a> and the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
Across from Alumni Hall and The Grotto are St.
Rita's Hall and Austin Hall.
In addition to being two residence halls, these two buildings also house the Campus Ministry Office and University Admissions Office, respectively.
Falvey Library, the campus's main research library, houses over 1,000,000 books, thousands of periodicals, television production studios, and quiet places for solitary or group study.
Behind Falvey Library is the Saint Augustine Center for Liberal Arts, commonly called &quot;SAC&quot;, which is home to many departments in the College of Liberal Arts, numerous offices, several seminar-type classrooms, and is home to the Advising and Professional Development Program.</p>
<p>East of Corr Hall sits Kennedy Hall, which houses the University Shop, the campus bookstore.
Across a small courtyard is Dougherty Hall, the campus's main dining hall, referred to as &quot;The Pit&quot; because of its underground location, one of three all-you-can-eat facilities on campus.
Dougherty also houses several smaller eateries and many Student Activity Offices.
Next to Kennedy is Connelly Center with its radically different architecture resembling an alpine ski lodge, containing: the Belle Aire Terrace, which serves a variety of food; several meeting rooms; areas for group study; the Commuter Student Lounge on the upper level; another lounge on the lower level, the campus cinema (movie theater); a large conference room; a smoothie shop; and Holy Grounds, the name of Villanova's coffee shop.</p>
<p>Between the dining halls of Dougherty and the meeting halls of Connelly is &quot;The Oreo&quot;.
A large black-and-white sculpture by <a>Jay Dugan</a>, some of the major campus celebrations have occurred in its circular shadow &ndash; including celebratory vandalism in the wake of the 1985 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship.
Sitting just west of The Quad, <em>The Awakening</em> (as it is officially known) has served as a meeting place in the heart of the campus for generations of Villanovans.</p>
<p>Still further east, there is &quot;The Quad&quot; where there lies a square formation between two dormitories, Sheehan Hall and Sullivan Hall.
Bartley Hall, home to the Villanova School of Business is the last building before Ithan Avenue, which is where main campus ends.
Bartley is adjacent to another entrance to Main Campus, at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and Ithan Avenue.
Behind Bartley Hall are two new buildings: The Health Services Building, home to the Counseling and Medical Centers; and Driscoll Hall, home to the College of Nursing.</p>
<h3>West Campus</h3>
<p>Situated across the <a>SEPTA</a> tracks north and west of Mendel hall is West Campus: home to St. Mary's Hall, the West Campus Apartments, and the <a>Law School</a>.
St. Mary's, a labyrinthine building of classrooms, residence rooms, a cafeteria, and large chapel, was originally built as a seminary, and was once home to the College of Nursing.
Behind St. Mary's sit the Apartments &ndash; eight buildings that house junior and senior resident students.</p>
<p>One of three commuter train stops on campus, the <a>Villanova Rail Station</a> on the <a>Paoli/Thorndale Line</a> provides access to the city of <a>Philadelphia</a>, about 30 minutes away.</p>
<h3>South Campus</h3>
<p>Sitting diagonally across Lancaster Ave. and Ithan Ave. from Bartley Hall, South Campus is home to several residence halls &ndash; usually reserved for underclassmen &ndash; and Donahue Hall, home to &quot;The Spit&quot;, short for &quot;South Pit&quot;.
Donahue hall also houses Donahue Market, commonly referred to by students as &quot;The Sparket&quot;.</p>
<p>The second and third of three on-campus train stops, the <a>Villanova stop</a> and the <a>Stadium stop</a> on the <a>SEPTA Route 100</a> line provides access to the city of <a>Philadelphia</a>, about 30 minutes away.</p>

<h3>NROTC</h3>
<p>The Villanova <a>Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (NROTC) Program mission is to develop <a>midshipmen</a> mentally, morally and physically and to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty, and loyalty, and with the core values of honor, courage and commitment in order to commission college graduates as naval officers who possess a basic professional background, are motivated toward careers in the naval service, and have a potential for future development in mind and character so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.</p>
<p>Villanova NROTC is part of the Philadelphia NROTC Consortium; consisting of Villanova University and <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> (including the cross town agreements with <a>Drexel</a> and <a>Temple University</a>).
Located in <a>Commodore John Barry</a> Hall, it is institution that has been a part of the University since World War Two.
The battalion consists of more than 100 Navy and Marine Corps midshipmen under the advisement of a staff of highly trained and motivated Navy and Marine Corp Officers and Senior Enlisted.
Known for its dedication to excellence, motivation, and pride, the NROTC unit has provided our nation with the finest Navy and Marine Corps Officers for over 50 years.</p>
<p>Midshipmen in the Villanova NROTC program are required to take specific Navy and Marine Corps classes, wear their service's uniform on Tuesdays, attend physical training events, participate in extra-curricular programs that range from sports teams to rifle-shooting, and adhere to the basic premise that &#x201c;a midshipman does not lie, cheat, or steal&#x201d;.
By the time their four years have come to a close, these values have been deeply ingrained into each midshipman, and they know what it means to be a <a>commissioned officer</a> and a Villanovan.
Thousands of midshipmen have gone through this experience to join the ranks of what can be considered the &#x201c;extended&#x201d; Villanova community in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.
Although times have changed as well as the specifics of training, the program remains largely unchanged from the program that has descended from World War Two.</p>
<p>Since its inception in the summer of 1946, the NROTC unit on campus has produced 22 Admirals and Generals in the United States Navy and Marine Corps.
At one point, there had only been two four-star generals in the U.S. Marine Corps, one of them the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and they had both been graduates of Villanova NROTC.
In 2004, the commanders of both <a>U.S. Naval Forces Atlantic</a> (<a>Admiral William J. Fallon</a>)and <a>U.S. Naval Forces Pacific</a> (<a>Admiral Walter F. Doran</a>)were Villanova NROTC graduates.
Admiral Fallon was later assigned as Commander, U.S. Central Command from March 2007 to March 2008.
ADM Fallon was the first Navy officer to hold that position.</p>
<h3>Music Activities</h3>
<p>Villanova University is without a formal music department; therefore, the Office of Music Activities is charged with the organization of the student <a>performing arts</a> groups on campus.
Musicians on campus are from every school in the University.
Located on the lower floor of St. Mary's Hall, the Office of Music Activities coordinates the activities of over 600 students &#x2014; nearly 10% of the student body.</p>
<h4>Villanova Band</h4>
<p>The Villanova Band is the largest and oldest musical group at Villanova with over 100 members.
The Villanova Band has five divisions: the Concert Band, the Scramble Band, the Pep Band, the Jazz Ensemble, and the Villanova Orchestra.
Any student or faculty at Villanova can participate in any or all of these bands.
The Concert Band plays two concerts; one at the end of each semester.
It also performs throughout the Villanova community and on its annual &quot;Fall Tour&quot;.
Past Fall Tour destinations include <a>Florida</a>, <a>Puerto Rico</a>, <a>Montreal</a>, and <a>South Carolina</a>.
The Scramble Band performs for Villanova Football games between plays and at halftime on the field.
The Villanova Pep Band performs at Villanova Men's and Women's Basketball games, including post-season games such as the Big East Tournament.
The Jazz Ensemble and Orchestra also has end-of-semester concerts but also performs around the Philadelphia area several times a year.
The band is made up of students of every school within Villanova.</p>
<h4>Villanova Singers</h4>
<p>Villanova's <a>men's chorus</a>, the Villanova Singers, was founded in 1953 by Dean Harold Gill Reuschlein, then Dean of the <a>Law School</a>.
Established for the purpose of singing various types of music and enriching the cultural life of the University, Dean Reuschlein was known to say that he was &quot;as proud of the Villanova Singers as I am of what the Law School has become.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 1963, the Singers have toured extensively; recent highlights include 7-day tours of <a>Italy</a> in the Spring 2001, <a>Austria</a> and <a>Germany</a> in the Spring of 2003, <a>Puerto Rico</a> in the Spring of 2004,  In concert with the Villanova Voices, the Singers perform two concerts each year: one for <a>Christmas</a>, and one in the Spring.</p>
<p>Entirely student-run, the Singers are governed by an 9-member board of students and sing an eclectic repertoire, ranging from sacred to patriotic, gospel to contemporary, as well as several arrangements by their director, Brian Meneely.
Within the Singers, there exists a smaller, student-directed <em><a>a cappella</a></em> group known as the Spires.
Alumni of the Spires include <a>Jim Croce</a>, <a>Tommy West</a> and <a>Tim Hauser</a> from <a>The Manhattan Transfer</a>.</p>

Their fiercest city rivalry, which is called the &quot;<a>Holy War</a>&quot;, is with <a>St.
Joseph's University</a>.</p>
<p>In the NCAA graduation report released on November 18, 2009, Villanova has a graduation-success rate of 96 percent for student-athletes who entered college in 2002-03.
Villanova women's basketball team is among the athletic program's 14 teams with a 100 percent graduation rate for 2002-03.
The Wildcats' nationally ranked men's basketball and football teams are both at 92 percent.
The men's basketball team's graduation-success rate places it fifth nationally among Division I schools.</p>
<p>In 2009, Villanova's football team won the national title in the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA).&quot;Our
number-one priority at Villanova has always been recruiting kids who want to get a good education,&quot; Wildcats football coach Andy Talley said.
Talley added that no matter how many games or titles Villanova wins, the athletic department's goal is to prepare students for life after college.
Despite those comments, Villanova is currently evaluating whether or not the football program should accept a possible invitation to join the Big East Conference if so invited.
Joining the Big East would allow Villanova to generate much more revenue from membership in a BCS conference.
&quot;Our football evaluation is ongoing,&quot; Villanova AD Vince Nicastro told The Associated Press.
&quot;We are moving forward as quickly as we can, but not at the expense of being absolutely thorough.
We still don't have a specific decision date, but it is likely to be resolved some time during this academic year.&quot;</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>The University Seal</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Right|Plaque of the Seal of Villanova University at the Connelly Center</a> An adaptation of the seal of the Order of St. Augustine, the seal of Villanova University is one of the campus's most ubiquitous images, adorning everything from buildings to chairs to backpacks.
A ribbon carries the University motto: <em>Veritas, Unitas, Caritas</em> (<a>Truth</a>, <a>Unity</a>, and <a>Charity</a>), <a>virtue</a>s to which every member of the Villanova community should aspire.
A book symbolizes Augustine's dedication to education and the <a>New Testament</a> where he found Christianity.
A <a>cincture</a> is part of the <a>habit</a> worn by members of the Order of Saint Augustine.
Hovering above is the flaming heart, symbol of Augustine's search for God and his love of neighbors.
Behind the book is the <a>crosier</a> &mdash; a staff traditionally held by a <a>Bishop</a> &mdash; commemorating Augustine's service as Bishop of <a>Hippo</a>.
Above and behind the book are two <a>cross</a>es, symbolic of Augustine's conversion and the University's commitment to Christianity.
Framing the central portion of the seal is a <a>laurel wreath</a> exemplifying victory through the pursuit of knowledge, and 1842 is the year of the University's founding.
Surrounding the seal is the incorporated fide of the University: <em>Universitas Villanova In Statu Pennsylvaniae</em>.</p>
<h3>The Liberty Bell's &quot;Sister Bell&quot;</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The old wing of the Falvey Library.</a></p>
<p>Villanova University is also home to the <a>Liberty Bell</a>'s &quot;Sister Bell,&quot; the replacement bell ordered from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry after the original bell cracked in 1753.
This new bell was installed at the Pennsylvania State House (<a>Independence Hall</a>), and attached to the State House clock.
The Sister Bell rang the hours until the late 1820s, when the bell was removed during a renovation and loaned to the <a>Olde St. Augustine Church</a> in Philadelphia.
In 1829, the bell was hung in a new cupola and tower designed by architect <a>William Strickland</a>.
There it remained until May 8, 1844, when it was destroyed, along with the Olde St. Augustine Church, during the <a>Philadelphia Nativist Riots</a>.
The friars of the <a>Order of Saint Augustine</a> had the &quot;Sister Bell&quot; recast and transferred to Villanova University.
The Sister Bell is currently enshrined in the Heritage Room on the basement floor of the St. Augustine Monastery on Villanova's campus.&lt;ref

<h3>Campus Myths</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Right|Alumni Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus.</a>
A number of legends are spread around campus by students.
Some of these include the existence of secret tunnels and catacombs under campus, the haunting of some of the older dormitories (sometimes linked to their use as hospitals during the <a>Civil War</a>),&lt;ref name=&quot;villanovan2405&quot; /&gt; and speculation over the existence of an entire wing of St. Mary's Hall which is completely blocked off.</p>
<p>The three buildings most commonly discussed as being haunted are Alumni Hall (located by St. Thomas of Villanova church on the main campus), St. Mary's Hall and Dundale (both located on the west campus).</p>
<p>Alumni Hall dates back to 1848 and stands as one of the oldest structures on campus.
The school was closed in 1861 due to the Civil War and reopened in 1865.
In that time this hall is believed to have been used as a military hospital and potential evidence of that use, such as a pulley located at the top of the main stairwell for moving bodies up and down, can still be seen.
The building was used as a hospital again for influenza patients after World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;villanovan2405&quot; /&gt;  This history has led to rumors that the building is haunted.</p>
<p>St.
Mary's Hall was built in 1962 and served as an Augustinian Seminary until 1972.
Laid out with long corridors and over a thousand rooms, there is a large chapel and many partial floors, basements and sub-basements to feed the legends of blocked off wings.&lt;ref
name=&quot;villanovan2405&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The property on which Dundale Hall is located was originally purchased by an industrialist, Israel Morris II, in 1874, and was built as a mansion for his family.
Purchased from his family in 1978, it has been used for a variety of meetings and is home to several offices.
On more than a handful of occasions, the school's Public Safety officers have been called out late at night to investigate lights in the building coming on inexplicably.&lt;ref
