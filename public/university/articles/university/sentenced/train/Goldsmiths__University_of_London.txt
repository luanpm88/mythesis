Based in <a>New Cross</a>, <a>London</a>, Goldsmiths specialises in the teaching and research of creative, cultural and cognitive disciplines.
The institution was founded in 1891 as <strong>Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute</strong> by the <a>Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths</a>.
It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed <strong>Goldsmiths' College</strong>.
The word 'College' was dropped from its branding in 2006, but &quot;Goldsmiths' College&quot;, with the <a>apostrophe</a>, remains the institution's formal legal name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1891, the <a>Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths</a> set up the Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute (more commonly referred to simply as the &quot;Goldsmiths' Institute&quot;), dedicated to &quot;the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes&quot;.
The Institute was based in New Cross at the former <a>Royal Naval School</a> building.
(This building, which was designed by the <a>architect</a> <a>John Shaw Jr</a>, is now known as the <a>Richard Hoggart</a> Building and remains the main building of the campus today.)
</p>
<p>In 1904, the Institute was acquired by the University of London and was re-established as Goldsmiths' College.
(The apostrophe was removed in a rebranding in 1993.)
Shortly after the acquisition, in 1907, the college added a new arts building, designed by Sir <a>Reginald Blomfield</a>, to the back of the main building.
During the <a>Second World War</a> it was decided to evacuate the students and faculty of the college to <a>University College, Nottingham</a>, a decision that proved wise when the main building was struck by an <a>incendiary bomb</a> and gutted in 1940 (the building was finally repaired in 1947).
During the 1960s the college experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers, and the main building was expanded and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built during this period in order to accommodate the new students.
The college has also come to acquire some historic buildings in the surrounding area including the former Deptford Town Hall and Laurie Grove Baths buildings.
In 1988 Goldsmiths became a full college of the University of London and in 1990 received its <a>Royal Charter</a>.
Among its wardens have been <a>Richard Hoggart</a> and <a>Ben Pimlott</a>.</p>
<p>The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all have Grade II listed building status.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths has been highly-ranked by <em>The Good University Guide</em> as the top London institution for the study of media, communications, music and visual arts.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The college is situated in <a>New Cross</a>, a highly populated area of south-east <a>London</a> with a considerable art and music scene.
The area is not served by London Underground, but is serviced by London Overground trains at New Cross and New Cross Gate.
These former East London Line stations were integrated into the London Overground network in May 2010 with services northbound to Dalston Junction; and southbound to Crystal Palace and West Croydon from New Cross Gate only.
National Rail services still run from both New Cross and New Cross Gate stations to central London termini (i.e.
London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross).</p>
<p>The college's main building, the Richard Hoggart Building, was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect <a>John Shaw Jr</a> (1803&#x2013;1870).
In addition to this the college has built several more modern buildings to develop more of a campus, including the <a>RIBA</a> award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the Ben Pimlott Building designed by <a>Will Alsop</a> completed in 2005 and the New Academic Building which was completed in 2010.</p>
<h2>Research and teaching</h2>
<p>Goldsmiths is best known for courses and research relating to creativity and culture, and has a reputation for producing <a>visual art</a>ists, particularly those collectively known as <a>YBA</a>.
The college's art department is widely recognised as one of Britain's most prestigious and culturally important, producing the YBA's art collective and over 20 Turner Prize nominees.
This reputation was largely established by the influence of <a>Michael Craig-Martin</a>, <a>Jon Thompson</a>, Nick De Ville as teaching staff.
</p>
<p>Goldsmiths' <a>sociology</a> department has been important in the recent development of the discipline in the UK and internationally, with leading sociologists such as <a>Paul Gilroy</a>, <a>Bev Skeggs</a>, <a>Nikolas Rose</a>, Don Slater, Celia Lury,  <a>Les Back</a>, and <a>Jeffrey Alexander</a>, working in the department in recent years.
</p>
<p>The Department of Design's comprehensive approach to design practice grew from a concern for ethical and environmentalist design.
This developed alongside research by John Wood, and others, that informs their research into <a>metadesign</a>.
On the Department's design education side, TERU, the Technology Education Research Unit, has been instrumental in understanding how design &amp; technology works in schools; how to encourage learners towards creative interventions that improve the made world; and how to help teachers to support that process.
The Writing Purposefully in Art and Design Network (Writing-PAD) has its main Centre at Goldsmiths.
The network now spans some 70 institutions across the art and design sector with 6 national and 2 International Writing PAD Centres.
</p>
<p>Goldsmiths is well-known for <a>Cultural Studies</a>.
The Media and Communications Department, as well as the Centre for Cultural Studies, is home to some of the leading scholars in this field including James Curran, <a>Scott Lash</a>, <a>Angela McRobbie</a>, <a>Sara Ahmed</a>, Nick Couldry, John Hutnyk, Sanjay Seth, and David Morley (scholar).
In anthropology there are figures such as Stephen Nugent, Sophie Day, Catherine Alexander, <a>Keith Hart</a> and <a>David Graeber</a>, whose contract at <a>Yale</a> was not renewed in 2005 because of his political commitments.
The Goldsmiths anthropology department is also well known for its focus on visual anthropology.
The realm of continental philosophy is represented with academics such as <a>Saul Newman</a>, Howard Caygill, Alexander D&#x00fc;ttmann and visiting professors <a>Andrew Benjamin</a> and <a>Bernard Stiegler</a>.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the area of Psychology there is <a>Chris French</a> a vocal sceptic of the <a>paranormal</a> who has appeared on television and radio on numerous occasions.
Centre for Russian Music, director Alexander Ivashkin,  is well known internationally for its outstanding archives (Prokofiev, Schnittke) and  unique collections ( Stravinsky, Russian Piano Music first editions).</p>
<p>League tables based on the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> all place Goldsmiths within the top 35 research-intensive universities in the UK: 33rd in the <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em>, 34th in <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> and 24th in <em><a>The Independent</a></em>.

<p>An amateur opera company based in the college, <a>Opera Gold</a>, draws its cast from college members past and present.</p>
<h2>2010 Occupations</h2>
<p>Between October and December 2010, Goldsmiths College was occupied three times.
The first occupation, of the Deptford Town Hall building, had some part in initiating a series of occupations across UK universities.
In the aftermath of the twenty-four hour occupation the Goldsmiths' Senior Management Team (SMT) informed the Student Union that due to the immense damages caused, further occupational protest action would result in the retroactive imposition of a &#x00a3;15,000 charge taken from the following year's budget to pay for the damage that the students concerned had caused.
The SU has suggested that this constitutes blackmail.
Since Deptford Town Hall, two further occupational protest actions have taken place in Goldsmiths.
Both have occurred in the College Library and have sought from the SMT a public condemnation of fees and cuts in Higher Education.
The SMT are yet to present a position either on increased tuition fees or on the proposed 100% cut to the Humanities and Social Sciences teaching grant.
Goldsmiths College management expressed in both public and private meetings, utter condemnation of these student actions, and it was reported that many were worried about job prospects after the activity of fellow students.
The Student's Union had failed to comment in either support or condemnation of the occupation in question, however some officers were said to have taken part along with some lecturers.</p>
