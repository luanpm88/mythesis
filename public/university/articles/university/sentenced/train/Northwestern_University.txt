<p> <strong>Northwestern University</strong> (<strong>NU</strong>) is a <a>private</a> university located primarily in <a>Evanston, Illinois</a>.
Northwestern has twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools and colleges offering 123 undergraduate degrees and 145 graduate and professional degrees.</p>
<p>Northwestern was founded in 1851 by <a>John Evans</a>, for whom Evanston is named, and eight other Chicago businessmen to serve the people of what had once been known as the <a>Northwest Territory</a>.
Instruction began in 1855; women were admitted in 1869.
Today, the main campus is a  parcel in Evanston, along the shores of <a>Lake Michigan</a>.
The university's <a>law</a> and <a>medical schools</a> are located on a  campus in Chicago's <a>Streeterville</a> neighborhood.
In 2008, the <a>Medill School of Journalism</a> and <a>School of Communication</a> opened a campus in <a>Education City</a>, <a>Doha</a>, <a>Qatar</a>.
In 2009, Northwestern enrolled 8,497 undergraduate and 7,880 graduate and professional students.
</p>
<p>Northwestern is one of 61 institutions elected to the  <a>Association of American Universities</a> and remains a research university with very high research activity.
Although the school&#x2019;s  founders were all Methodists, including three <a>ministers</a> of the <a>church</a>, they were  committed to <a>non-sectarian</a> admissions for the entire population of the territory.
</p>
<p>John Evans bought  of land along Lake Michigan in 1853 and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of <a>Evanston</a>.
The first building, <a>Old College</a>, opened on November 5, 1855.
In order to raise funds for construction, Northwestern sold $100 &quot;perpetual scholarships&quot; that entitled the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.
In 1873, the <a>Evanston College for Ladies</a> merged with Northwestern, and <a>Frances Willard</a>, who later gained fame as a <a>suffragist</a>, became the school's first dean of women.
Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869 and the first woman was graduated in 1874.
Willard Residential College (1938) is named in her honor.</p>
<p>Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>.
In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago.
As the university increased in wealth and distinction and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; a modern research university was the result which combined professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, and which gave equal weight to both teaching and research.
The <a>Association of American Universities</a> invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917.
<a>thumb|left|300px| Deering Library (1933) in 2008</a> Under <a>Walter Dill Scott</a>'s presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by <a>James Gamble Rogers</a> to house the professional schools; established the <a>Kellogg School of Management</a>; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, <a>Dyche Stadium</a> and <a>Deering Library</a> among others.
In 1933, a proposal to merge Northwestern with the <a>University of Chicago</a> was considered but rejected.
Northwestern hosted the first-ever <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a> game in 1939 in the original <a>Patten Gymnasium</a>, which was later demolished and relocated farther north in order to make room for the <a>Technological Institute</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|University Hall (1869), the second building constructed on campus, and the oldest building still standing.</a>
Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by <a>World War II</a>.
<a>Franklyn B. Snyder</a> led the university from 1939 to 1949 and during the war nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses.
After the war surging enrollments under the <a>G.I.
Bill</a> drove drastic expansion of both campuses.
In 1948, prominent anthropologist <a>Melville J. Herskovits</a> founded the Program of <a>African Studies</a> at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.
<a>J.
Roscoe Miller</a>'s tenure from 1949&#x2013;1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests.
In 1978, the first and second <a>Unabomber</a> attacks occurred at Northwestern University.
Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.
Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter was a particular source of <a>town and gown</a> tension and led to a federal lawsuit between the city and university which was settled out-of-court in 2004.</p>
<p>Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President <a>Arnold R. Weber</a> was able to stabilize university finances leading to a revitalization of the campuses.
As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, <a>Henry S. Bienen</a>'s tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness.
In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information that exonerated Illinois death row inmate <a>Anthony Porter</a> two days before his scheduled execution and the Innocence Project has since exonerated nine more men.
On January 11, 2003, in a speech at Northwestern School of Law's Lincoln Hall, <a>Governor of Illinois</a> <a>George Ryan</a> announced that he would <a>commute</a> the sentences of more than 150 <a>death row</a> inmates.</p>
<p>The <a>Latin</a> phrase on Northwestern's seal, <em>Quaecumque sunt vera</em> (Whatsoever things are true) is drawn from The Epistle of Paul to the Philippians 4:8, while the Greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open book is taken from the Gospel of John 1:14: <em>&#x03bf; &#x03bb;&#x03cc;&#x03b3;&#x03bf;&#x03c2; &#x03c0;&#x03bb;&#x03ae;&#x03c1;&#x03b7;&#x03c2; &#x03c7;&#x03ac;&#x03c1;&#x03b9;&#x03c4;&#x03bf;&#x03c2; &#x03ba;&#x03b1;&#x03b9; &#x03b1;&#x03bb;&#x03b7;&#x03b8;&#x03b5;&#x03af;&#x03b1;&#x03c2;</em> (The Word full of grace and truth).
<a>Purple</a> became Northwestern's official color in 1892, replacing <a>black</a> and <a>gold</a> after a university committee concluded that too many other universities had used these colors.
Today, Northwestern has but one official color, royal purple, although white is something of an official color as well, being mentioned in both the university's earliest song, <em>Alma Mater</em> (&quot;Hail to purple, hail to white&quot;) and in many university guidelines.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Evanston</h3>
<p>[[File:Northwestern University Evanston campus.jpg|thumb|right|Northwestern's
Evanston campus is located on [[Lake Michigan]].]]
Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the College, Graduate School, and Business School are located, runs north-south between Lake Michigan and <a>Sheridan Road</a> and from Clark Street to <a>Central Street</a>.
North Campus is home to the <a>fraternity</a> <a>quads</a>, the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and other athletic facilities, the <a>Technological Institute</a>, <a>Dearborn Observatory</a>, and other science-related buildings including Ryan Hall, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center.
South Campus is home to the University's humanities buildings, music buildings, e.g.
Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, art buildings such as the <a>Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art</a>, and the <a>sorority</a> quads.
Each of the two campuses has a noticeably different atmosphere, owing to the predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Culture in the other.
In the 1960s, the University created an additional 84 acres by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan.
Among some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library, Norris University Center (the student union), and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall.</p>
<p>The <a>Chicago Transit Authority</a>'s <a>elevated train</a> running through Evanston is called the <a>Purple Line</a>, taking its name from Northwestern's school color.
The <a>Foster</a> and <a>Davis</a> stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the <a>Noyes</a> station is close to the northern end of the campus.
The <a>Central</a> station is close to <a>Ryan Field</a>, Northwestern's football stadium.
The <a>Evanston Davis Street</a> <a>Metra</a> station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the <a>Evanston Central Street</a> Metra station is near Ryan Field.

<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>[[Image:Ward Building 060527.jpg[|thumb|right|The
Montgomery Ward Memorial Building (1927) at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, America's first academic skyscraper.]]
Northwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's <a>Streeterville</a> neighborhood.
The Chicago campus is home to the <a>medical school</a> and hospital, the <a>law school</a>, the part-time business school, and the <a>School of Continuing Studies</a>, which offers evening and weekend courses for working adults.
Northwestern's professional schools and hospital in downtown Chicago are about four blocks east of the <a>Chicago</a> station on the CTA <a>Red Line</a>.
The <a>Chicago Transit Authority</a> and <a>Pace Suburban Bus Service</a> have several bus routes that run through both campuses.</p>
<p>Northwestern's professional schools had been founded or affiliated with the university at various times in its history and consequently their facilities were scattered throughout Chicago.
In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Scott's capital campaign,  of land were purchased at the Corner of <a>Chicago Avenue</a> and <a>Lake Shore Drive</a> for $1.5 million in 1920.
<a>James Gamble Rogers</a> was given a commission to create a master plan for the major buildings on the new campus which he designed in  <a>collegiate gothic</a> style.
In 1923, Mrs. <a>Montgomery Ward</a> donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the <a>Montgomery Ward Memorial Building</a> to house the medical and dental schools and to create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.
The building would become the first skyscraper housing academic facilities in the United states.
and <a>Levy Mayer Hall</a> to house the School of Law.
The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927.
The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of <a>Thorn Hall</a> in 1931 and <a>Abbott Hall</a> in 1939.</p>
<h3>Qatar</h3>
<p>In fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in <a>Education City</a>, <a>Doha</a>, <a>Qatar</a> joining five other American universities: <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, <a>Cornell University</a>, <a>Georgetown University</a>, <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, and <a>Virginia Commonwealth University</a>.
The <a>Medill School of Journalism</a> and <a>School of Communication</a> offer <a>bachelors degree</a>s in journalism and communication respectively.
The <a>Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development</a> provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom will rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The 2010 Report by The Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Northwestern a &#x201c;B-&#x201d; on its College Sustainability Report Card.
In January 2009, the Green Power Partnership (GPP, sponsored by the EPA) listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country that purchase the most energy from renewable sources.
A total of 40 million kWh, or 20% of the energy supplied to Northwestern&#x2019;s Evanston and Chicago campuses is offset through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).
The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN), supporting research, teaching and outreach in these themes, was launched in 2008.</p>
<p>Northwestern requires that all new buildings will be <a>LEED-certified</a>.
Currently there are two LEED Certified buildings on campus: The Wieboldt School of Continuing Studies was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center was awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006.
New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy code requirements where technically feasible.
The university also released the Evanston Campus Framework Plan at the beginning of the 2008-2009 academic year, which outlines plans for future development of the Evanston Campus.
The plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings, but also discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access.
Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990.
Annually more than 1,500 tons are recycled at NU, which represents 26% of the waste produced on campus.
Additionally, all landscape waste at NU is composted.
Northwestern has had <a>sixteen presidents in its history</a> (excluding interim presidents), the current president, <a>Morton O. Schapiro</a>, an economist, having recently succeeded <a>Henry Bienen</a>, whose fourteen-year tenure ended on August 31, 2009.
The president has a staff of 21 vice presidents, directors, and other assistants for administrative, financial, faculty, and student matters.
<a>Daniel I. Linzer</a>, provost since September 2007, serves under the president as the chief academic officer of the university to whom the deans of every academic school, leaders of cross-disciplinary units, and chairmen of the seventeen standing faculty committees must report.
</p>
<p>The University Senate is composed of all full-time faculty and makes recommendations on matters of educational policy, recommends candidates for honorary degrees, and can elect special committees such as the 22-member General Faculty Committee which serves as a liaison between the faculty and administration.</p>
<p>Northwestern University is composed of 11 schools and colleges.
The faculty for each school consists of the university president, provost, the dean of the school, and the instructional faculty.
Faculty are responsible for teaching, research, advising students, and serving on committees.
The admission requirements, degree requirements, course of study, disciplinary and degree recommendations are determined by the voting members of each school's faculty (assistant professor and above).</p>
<p>In 2009, Northwestern's endowment decreased by 24.8% to $5.45 billion, making it the 8th-largest endowment of all American universities.
In the eleven-year period between 1997 and 2007, the endowment grew by an average rate of 13.4%.
$187.9 million in gifts and other voluntary support were made to Northwestern in 2006&#x2013;2007.
In 2003, Northwestern finished a five-year capital campaign which raised $1.55 billion, $150 million more than its goal.
In 2007, the university sold its royalty interest in the pain relief drug <a>Lyrica</a> (developed at Northwestern by Professor <a>Richard Bruce Silverman</a>) for $700 million, the largest royalty sale in history,</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> Northwestern is a large, highly residential research university.
Accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> and the respective national professional organizations for chemistry, psychology, business, education, journalism, music, engineering, law, and medicine, the university offers 123 undergraduate programs and 145 graduate and professional programs.
Although undergraduates are required to complete at least 12 quarters on campus to graduate, Northwestern offers honors, accelerated, and joint degree programs in medicine, science, mathematics, engineering, and journalism.
The comprehensive doctoral graduate program has high coexistence with undergraduate programs.
Since 1951, Northwestern has awarded 520 <a>honorary degrees</a> to distinguished individuals.</p>
<p>Undergraduate tuition for the 2008&#x2013;2009 school year was $37,125.
Northwestern awards financial aid solely on the basis of need through loans, work-study, grants, and scholarships.
$213.8 million was offered in financial aid across the university's undergraduate and graduate programs, including $81 million from university funds, federal and state aid, and outside sources awarded to 3,380 undergraduates in 2007&#x2013;2008.
</p>
<p>Among the six undergraduate schools, 51.2% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the <a>Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences</a>, 17.2% in the <a>McCormick School of Engineering</a>, 14.7% in the <a>School of Communication</a>, 8.4% in the <a>Medill School of Journalism</a>, 5.0% in the <a>Bienen School of Music</a>, and 3.4% in the <a>School of Education and Social Policy</a>.
The five most commonly awarded degrees are in economics, journalism, communication studies, psychology, and political science.
While professional students are affiliated with their respective schools, full-time graduate academic degrees are primarily administered by The Graduate School.
With 2,075 students enrolled in science, engineering, and health fields, the largest graduate programs by enrollment include chemistry, integrated biology, material sciences, electrical engineering and computer science, neuroscience, and economics.
The <a>Kellogg School of Management</a>'s <a>MBA</a>, <a>School of Law</a>'s <a>JD</a>, and <a>Feinberg School of Medicine</a>'s <a>MD</a> are the three largest <a>professional degree</a> programs by enrollment.
The Northwestern library contains over 4.6 million volumes, 4.5 million microforms, and 45,000 periodicals making it (by volume) the 30th-largest university library in North America and the 10th-largest library among private universities.
Notable collections in the library system include the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, one of the largest <a>Africana</a> collections in the world,  an extensive collection of early edition printed music and manuscripts as well as late-modern works, and an art collection noted for its 19th and 20th-century <a>Western art</a> and <a>architecture periodicals</a>.
The library system participates with twelve other universities in digitizing its collections as a part of the <a>Google Book Search</a> project.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center (2005)</a></p>
<p>Northwestern was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1917 and remains a research university with &quot;very high&quot; research activity.
Northwestern's schools of management, engineering, and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation.
Northwestern manages research and development budgets that totaled $420.0 million in 2006, 34th among all universities and 13th among private universities in the United States.
$250.0 million originated from the federal government, $12.2 million from industry, $5.1 million from state and local governments, $44.5 million from other sources, and $108.2 million from Northwestern's own institutional funds, the third most among private universities nationwide.
Northwestern spent $29.8 million on research in non-science and engineering fields like management, education, law, communication, and journalism in 2006, 12th most among all American universities.
$61.56 million in congressional <a>earmarks</a> were appropriated to Northwestern between 1990 and 2003 and $4.98 million in appropriations were granted in 2008.
Northwestern researchers disclosed 184 inventions, filed 158 patents applications, received 32 patents, started 9 companies, and generated $776 million in license income in 2008, although the latter is distorted by the $700 million sale of <a>Lyrica</a> to <a>Pfizer</a>, the largest royalty sale in history.</p>
<p>NU is home to the Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, Materials Research Center, Institute for Policy Research, International Institute for Nanotechnology, Center for Catalysis and Surface Science, Buffet Center for International and Comparative Studies, the Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern  and the <a>Argonne/Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Rock in front of University Hall</a> The undergraduates have a number of traditions: Painting <a>The Rock</a> (originally a fountain  donated by the Class of 1902) is a way to advertise, for example, campus organizations, events in Greek life, student groups, and university-wide events.
<a>Dance Marathon</a>, a 30-hour philanthropic event, raises several hundred thousand dollars every winter.
<em>Primal Scream</em> is held at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals week every quarter; students lean out of windows or gather in courtyards and scream.
Armadillo Day, or, more popularly, <a>Dillo Day</a>, is held on Northwestern's <a>Lakefill</a> every Spring on the weekend after <a>Memorial Day</a>.
The Clock Tower at the Rebecca Crown Center glows purple, instead of its usual white, after a winning game, and by so doing, proclaiming the happy news.
The Clock Tower remains purple until a loss or until the end of the sports season.
Whereas formerly the Clock Tower was lighted only for football victories, wins for men's basketball and women's lacrosse now merit commemoration as well; important victories in other sports may also prompt an empurpling.</p>
<p><a>Corporal punishment</a> for undergraduates was introduced in 1922, when it was announced that students of either sex would be liable to be <a>spanked</a> for a range of offenses mainly concerning behavior in public, including swearing and smoking (if aged under 21), rollerskating in the downtown district, and being rowdy in an ice cream parlor.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p><em><a>The Daily Northwestern</a></em> is the main student newspaper.
Established in 1881, and published on weekdays during the academic year, it is directed entirely by undergraduates.
Although it serves the Northwestern community, the <em>Daily</em> has no business ties to the university, being supported wholly by advertisers.
It is owned by the <a>Students Publishing Company</a>.
Current circulation is in excess of 7,500.</p>
<p><a>North by Northwestern</a> is an online magazine founded and run by undergraduates.
It was established in September 2006 by students at the Medill School and is published on weekdays, with updates on breaking news stories and special events throughout the day and on weekends.
</p>
<p><a>WNUR</a> ((89.3 <a>FM</a>) is a 7,200 watt <a>radio station</a> that broadcasts to Chicago and its northern suburbs.
WNUR's programming consists of music - jazz, classical, rock - varsity sports (football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, and women's lacrosse),  breaking news on weekdays, politics, current events, and literature.</p>
<p><a>Northwestern News Network</a>, commonly known as NNN, is a student-produced television news report.
It broadcasts news and sports programming three days a week during the academic year on NU Channel 1, online at nnntv.org, and weeknights at 10 p.m. on Evanston cable access channel 6.</p>
<p><em>Syllabus</em> is the undergraduate yearbook.
First published in 1885, the yearbook is an epitome of that year's events at Northwestern.
Published by <a>Students Publishing Company</a> and edited by Northwestern students, it is distributed in late May.</p>
<p><em><a>Northwestern Flipside</a></em> is an undergraduate satirical magazine.
Founded in 2009, <em>The Flipside</em> publishes a weekly issue both in print and online.</p>
<p><em>Helicon</em> is the university's undergraduate literary magazine.
Started in 1979, it is published twice a year, a web issue in the Winter, and a print issue with a web complement in the Spring.</p>
<p><em>TriQuarterly Online</em> (formerly TriQuarterly) is a literary magazine published twice a year featuring poetry, fiction, nonfiction, drama, literary essays, reviews, a blog, and graphic art.</p>
<h3>Performing arts</h3>
<p>Two annual productions are especially notable: the Waa-Mu show, and the <a>Dolphin show</a>.
Waa-Mu is an original musical, written and produced almost entirely by students.
Children's theater is represented on campus by <a>Griffin&#x2019;s Tale</a> and <a>Purple Crayon Players</a>.
Its umbrella organization&#x2014;the Student Theatre Coalition, or StuCo&#x2014;organizes the 9 fully-functioning student theatre companies, plus some other performance groups.
Students produce over sixty independent productions each year.
Many Northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers.
Chicago's Lookingglass Theatre was founded by several alumni, including <a>David Schwimmer</a>, and began in the Great Room in <a>Jones Residential College</a>.</p>
<p>Northwestern also has a variety of improv groups.
The improv and sketch comedy group <a>Mee-Ow</a> lists <a>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>, <a>Ana Gasteyer</a>, <a>Dermot Mulroney</a>, <a>Seth Meyers</a>, <a>John Cameron Mitchell</a>, and <a>Kristen Schaal</a> among its alumni.
<a>Mee-Ow</a>, <a>The Titanic Players</a>, and Out da Box, a multicultural comedy show, along with Northwestern's theatre department, have brought attention to Northwestern's improv comedy training and performance.</p>
<p>There are ten a cappella groups and a variety of dance companies on campus.
The dance companies include Fusion Dance Company, Northwestern's premiere Hip-Hop Dance Crew; Graffiti Dancers, a dance group that focuses on jazz and modern; and Boomshaka, Northwestern's premiere drum and dance ensemble, combining body rhythm, drumming, and dance.
Radio drama featuring student voice actors is a staple of WNUR's programming.</p>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>Many Northwestern students are also heavily involved in community service.
Annual events include <a>Dance Marathon</a>, a 30-hour event that raised over $917,000 for charity in 2009.
Another annual event, Project Pumpkin, is a <a>Halloween</a> celebration hosted by Northwestern Community Development Corps (NCDC), where over 800 local children are invited to campus for an afternoon of games and candy.
NCDC connects hundreds of NU student volunteers to over 20 volunteer sites in Evanston and Chicago communities throughout the year.
Many students have assisted with the <a>Special Olympics</a> and have taken <a>alternative spring break</a> trips to hundreds of service sites across the United States.
Northwestern students also participate in the <a>Freshman Urban Program</a>, which is a special program for students who are interested in community service.
A large and growing number of students participate in the university's Global Engagement Summer Institute (GESI), a group service-learning expedition in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, in conjunction with the <a>Foundation for Sustainable Development</a>.
Internationally recognized <a>non-profit organizations</a> have also been born at NU such as the <a>World Health Imaging, Informatics and Telemedicine Alliance</a>, which spun off from an engineering student's <a>honors</a> <a>thesis</a>.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p> Northwestern has diverse student housing options, including both regular residence halls and specially-themed &quot;Residential Colleges.&quot;
Some residential colleges include community service-themed Residential College of Cultural and Community Studies (CCS), business-themed Ayers College of Commerce and Industry, Jones Residential College, dedicated to the arts, multi-themed Willard Residential College, science and engineering themed Slivka Residential College, the International Studies Residential College and the Communications Residential College (CRC) for students interested in communications.
</p>
<p>In fall 2007, 27% of students were affiliated with a <a>fraternity</a> or a <a>sorority</a>.
Northwestern recognizes 21 fraternities and 18 sororities.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> [[Image:Lacrosse women.jpg|right|thumb|2005
[[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]] game between the <a>Virginia Cavaliers</a> and <a>Northwestern Wildcats</a>]] Northwestern is a charter member of the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> and the only private institution in the conference.
Currently, Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's) in addition to numerous club sports.
The <a>women's lacrosse team</a> won five consecutive <a>NCAA</a> <a>national championships</a> between 2005 and 2009, went undefeated in 2005 and 2009, and holds several scoring records.
The men's <a>basketball</a> team is recognized by the <a>Helms Athletic Foundation</a> as the 1931 National Champion.
In the 2008&#x2013;2009 school year, a total of 184 athletes received Academic All-Big Ten honors: 75 athletes in the fall season, 41 in the winter season, and 68 in the spring season.</p>
<p>The football team plays at <a>Ryan Field</a> (formerly known as Dyche Stadium); the basketball and volleyball teams play at <a>Welsh-Ryan Arena</a>.
Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats.
Before 1924, they were known as &quot;The Purple&quot; and unofficially as &quot;The Fighting Methodists.&quot;
The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the <a>Chicago Daily Tribune</a> who wrote that even in a loss to the <a>University of Chicago</a>, &quot;Football players had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to [Coach Glenn] <a>Thistletwaite's</a> boys.&quot;
The name was so popular that university board members made &quot;wildcats&quot; the official nickname just months later.
In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname from &quot;Wildcats&quot; to &quot;Purple Haze&quot; but the new name never stuck.</p>
<p>The Northwestern Athletics' mascot is <a>Willie the Wildcat</a>.
However, the team's first mascot was not Willie, but a live, caged bear cub from the <a>Lincoln Park Zoo</a> named Furpaw.
In fall 1923, Furpaw was driven to the playing field to greet the fans before each game.
After a losing season, the team decided that Furpaw was the harbinger of bad luck and banished him from campus.
Willie made his debut ten years later in 1933 as a logo, but did not actually come to life until 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade.

Field (stadium)|Ryan Field (1926)]], Northwestern's 49,000 seat football stadium ]] Although <a>Northwestern's football team</a> has made 73 appearances in the top 10 of the AP poll since 1936 (including 5 at #1) as well as winning eight Big 10 conference championships since 1903, Other dubious distinctions include being on the losing end of <a>the greatest comeback in Division I-A history</a> and holding the record for the longest losing streak in Division I-A, losing 34 consecutive games between 1979 and 1982.
In 2004, Northwestern broke a 33-year losing streak (46 years at home) by defeating No. 7-ranked <a>Ohio State</a> 33-27.
After head coach <a>Ara Parseghian</a> left the program in 1964, the team did not appear in a bowl game until the <a>1996 Rose Bowl</a>.
Despite playing in the 1996 Rose Bowl, 1997 <a>Citrus Bowl</a>, <a>2000 Alamo Bowl</a>, 2003 <a>Motor City Bowl</a>, <a>2005 Sun Bowl</a>, <a>2008 Alamo Bowl</a>, and <a>2010 Outback Bowl</a>, the last bowl game Northwestern won was the <a>1949 Rose Bowl</a>.
Following the sudden death of football coach <a>Randy Walker</a> in 2006, 31-year old former <a>All-American</a> Northwestern <a>linebacker</a> <a>Pat Fitzgerald</a> assumed the position, becoming the youngest <a>Division I FBS coach</a> at the time.

<p>In 1998, two former <a>Northwestern basketball</a> players were charged and convicted for sports bribery as a result of being paid to <a>shave points</a> in games against three other Big 10 schools during the 1995 season.
The <a>football team</a> became embroiled in a different betting scandal later that year when federal prosecutors indicted four former players for perjury related to <a>betting</a> on their own games.
In August 2001, Rashidi Wheeler, a senior <a>safety</a>, collapsed and died during practice from an <a>asthma attack</a>.
An autopsy revealed that he had <a>ephedrine</a>, a <a>stimulant</a> banned by the <a>NCAA</a>, in his system, which prompted Northwestern to investigate the prevalence of stimulants and other banned substances across all of its athletic programs.
In 2006, the Northwestern women's <a>soccer</a> team was suspended and coach Jenny Haigh resigned following the release of images of alleged <a>hazing</a>.</p>
