<p> </p>
<p>The <strong><em>Vrije Universiteit</em></strong> (literal translation from <a>Dutch</a>: &quot;Free University&quot;) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Amsterdam</a>, <a>Netherlands</a>.
The Dutch name is often abbreviated as <em>VU</em>.
The university is located on a compact urban campus in the southern part of Amsterdam in the <a>Buitenveldert</a> district.
Though a faith-based, private institution, the VU receives government funding on a parity basis with the public universities.</p>
<p>The university should not be confused with the <a>University of Amsterdam</a>, which is a different university, located in the same city.
That university was formerly owned and operated by the City of Amsterdam, but is now one of the <a>public universities in the Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p>The VU University Amsterdam has about 22,738 students, most of whom are full-time students.
The number of faculty members and researchers is 2764 (excluding personnel at <a>VU University Medical Center</a>).
Teaching and research activities are supported by 1905 administrative, clerical, technical, and other employees.
The university's annual budget is around US$500 million, about two third of which comes from the Dutch government.
Tuition, research grants, and industrial contracts provide the rest.</p>
<p>The logo of the university is the <a>griffin</a>, pictured on the right.
The position of its wings symbolizes the freedom in the university's name: freedom from both state and church.

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Abraham Kuyper, founder of the VU University Amsterdam</a> The VU was founded in 1880 by <a>Abraham Kuyper</a> as the first <a>orthodox-Protestant (Calvinist)</a> university in The Netherlands.
Kuyper was a Dutch politician, journalist, and prime minister of The Netherlands from 1901 to 1905.
He was a professor of theology at the VU as well as the first <em>rector magnificus</em> (President of the University).</p>
<p><em>Vrije Universiteit</em> literally means 'Free University' (better: 'Liberated University') to signify freedom from both government and church.
The education itself, however, is not free of cost.
To overcome this association, recently a decision was made to use the term <em>VU University</em> instead of <em>Free University</em> whenever the English translation is needed.</p>
<p>When the Vrije Universiteit started in 1880, it hired some rooms in the Scottish Missionary Church (today a theatre called <a>De Kleine Komedie</a>) and used them as lecture rooms.
Here the founder Abraham Kuyper and his four co-professors gave their lectures.
In 1883 the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the quickly growing number of students and the university bought another building: Keizersgracht 162.
In the following years the university bought more buildings throughout the city.
Since 1968 the university as a whole is located on a campus in the Buitenveldert district.
</p>
<p>As with all accredited universities in The Netherlands, students pay a (government determined) tuition, which is currently (2009) around &#x20ac;1600/year for students from the European Union and ranges from &#x20ac;7000 to &#x20ac;9000/year for students from elsewhere.
Most Dutch students receive a grant or loan from the government to cover tuition and living expenses.</p>
<p>Although current students and faculty members are adherents of many religions, as a consequence of its Protestant heritage, the VU has always placed a special emphasis on the social and cultural context in which it operates.
Many faculties offer courses teaching students about the historical, social, and cultural issues related to their discipline, with course names like &quot;Social Aspects of Science&quot;.
Topics such as the consequences of science for society, ethics, and related issues are discussed.</p>
<h2>Management structure</h2>
<p>The <a>board of trustees</a> of the university is the <em>Vereniging VU-Windesheim</em>, which also manages the <em><a>Christelijke Hogeschool Windesheim</a></em> (University of Applied Sciences) in <a>Zwolle</a> as well as <a>VU University Medical Center</a>, which is the university's <a>teaching hospital</a>.
The university is run by an <a>executive board</a> (&quot;College van Bestuur&quot; in <a>Dutch</a>) which makes decisions in consultation with the Board of <a>Deans</a> (&quot;College van Decanen&quot; in Dutch).
</p>
<p>Recent <em>rectores magnifici</em> (University Presidents) have been:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1983-1987 Pieter Drenth</li>
  <li>1987-1993 Cees Datema</li>
  <li>1993-1997 Egbert Boeker</li>
  <li>1997-2006 Taede Sminia</li>
  <li>2006-today <a>Lex Bouter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Eastern entrance to the campus</a> Organisationally, the university is divided into 12 faculties, which offer a great variety of <a>bachelor</a>'s, <a>master's</a>, and <a>Ph.D.</a> programmes in many fields.
These faculties are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Arts</a> [<a>http://www.let.vu.nl/english/</a>]</li>
  <li><a>Dentistry</a> [<a>http://www.acta.nl/</a>]</li>
<li><a>Earth science</a> and <a>life science</a> [<a>http://www.falw.vu.nl/english/</a>]</li>
  <li><a>Economics</a> and <a>business</a> [<a>http://www.feweb.vu.nl/</a>]</li>
  <li><a>Human movement</a> [<a>http://www.fbw.vu.nl/indexE.htm</a>]</li>
<li><a>Law</a> [<a>http://www.rechten.vu.nl/</a>]</li>
  <li><a>Medicine</a> [<a>http://www.med.vu.nl/english/index.cfm</a>]</li>
<li><a>Philosophy</a> [<a>http://www.wijsbegeerte.vu.nl/english/</a>]</li>
  <li><a>Psychology</a> and <a>pedagogy</a> [<a>http://www.psy.vu.nl/fpp.php/research/</a>]</li>
<li><a>Exact science</a> [<a>http://www.few.vu.nl/en/index.php</a>]</li>
<li><a>Social science</a> [<a>http://www.fsw.vu.nl/english/index.cfm</a>]</li>
<li><a>Theology</a> [<a>http://www.godgeleerdheid.vu.nl/english/index.cfm</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>The language of instruction for most bachelor's courses is Dutch.
However, many of the master's programmes are given entirely in English in order to attract students from outside The Netherlands.
In fact, in some master's programmes, international students outnumber the Dutch students by a large margin.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. programme is different from that in the United Kingdom and the U.S.A. Rather than applying to the university for admission in the winter, prospective students must find a (full) professor who has a position for a Ph.D. student, called an AiO (Assistant in Opleiding&#x2014;Assistant in Training), and contact him or her directly.
Most professors and faculties advertise their open positions on their Websites.
AiOs are paid a salary and are considered university employees.
They do not have to pay tuition.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Left: Exact Sciences; Right: Humanities and law</a> From its humble beginnings, the VU has become a modern research university.
The research focus is given by the VU-star, which emphasizes seven broad areas in which the university excels: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Communication, knowledge, and meaning</li>
  <li>Computerization and digitization</li>
  <li>Economics and society</li>
  <li>Health and disease</li>
  <li>Legal and administrative issues</li>
  <li>Life sciences</li>
  <li>System earth</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these research foci are interdisciplinary, with faculty members and students from multiple faculties working together to forge new breakthroughs.
