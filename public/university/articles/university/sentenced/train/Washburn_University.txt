<h2>History</h2>
<p>Washburn University was established in February 1865 as <strong>Lincoln College</strong> by a <a>charter</a> issued by the State of Kansas and the General Association of  Congregational Ministers and Churches of Kansas on land donated by abolitionist <a>John Ritchie</a>.
The school was renamed <strong>Washburn College</strong> in 1868 after receiving a $25,000 donation from <a>Ichabod Washburn</a>, a church deacon and industrialist who resided in <a>Worcester</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>Washburn&#x2019;s mascot honors the school&#x2019;s early benefactor, <a>Ichabod Washburn</a>.
The original design of the studious-looking, tailcoat-clad figure was created in 1938 by <a>Bradbury Thompson</a> (B.A. &#x2018;34), who became an internationally acclaimed graphic artist.</p>
<p>In 1913 the medical department of Washburn College closed.
Previously as the Kansas Medical School it had become infamous on December 10, 1895, when it was discovered that some of the bodies used for anatomical study had been stolen from local cemeteries.
As the news was being printed (eventually across the country) the governor called out state troops to protect the school in fear of a riot.
Three of the Doctors, including the Dean of the school, and a janitor/student from the school were arrested as well as one man not a member of the school.
Charges against the doctors were discharged, the janitor was convicted but had his conviction reversed on appeal and the final man was convicted but later pardoned.</p>
<p>Formerly a <a>municipal university</a>, the university's primary funding was moved from city property tax to county sales tax sources in 1999, with the school retaining status as a municipal subdivision of the state.
Washburn is governed by its own nine-member Board of Regents.</p>
<p>On June 8, 1966, only a few days after classes were dismissed for the summer, much of the campus was demolished by a <a>tornado</a>, and completely denuded of trees.
Three months before the tornado struck, the Washburn Board of Trustees had reinsured every building on campus for the maximum amount.
A week after the tornado struck, summer classes began at Topeka West High School.
By the fall of 1966, Stoffer Hall was repaired and trailers were in place.
It took years to reconstruct the campus, with students attending classes in trailers well into the early 1970s.</p>

<p>WU provides broadly-based <a>liberal arts</a> and professional education through more than 200 certificate, associate, baccalaureate, master&#x2019;s and juris doctor programs through the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Law, Business, Nursing and Applied Studies.
The university is home to several honor and recognition societies.
The most prestigious societies are the <a>Sagamore Society</a> for men and NONOSO for women.</p>
