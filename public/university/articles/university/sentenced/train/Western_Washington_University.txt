<h2>History</h2>
<p>Western was established as the <em>New Whatcom <a>Normal School</a></em>, a teachers' school for women, by <a>Phoebe Judson</a> in <a>Lynden, Washington</a>.
Eventually the school moved to Bellingham (then &quot;New Whatcom&quot;), and through the efforts of William R. Moultray and George Judson (Phoebe's son), <a>Governor</a> <a>John McGraw</a> signed legislation establishing the <em>New Whatcom Normal School</em> on February 24, 1893.
The first official class entered in 1899, composed of 88 students.</p>
<p>The institution that is now <em>Western Washington University</em> has since undergone several name changes.
In 1901, the school's name was changed to <em>State Normal School at Whatcom</em> to reflect New Whatcom's name change.
Again, in 1904, the name was changed to <em>Washington State Normal School at Bellingham</em> when the townships of Whatcom and <a>Fairhaven</a> joined, and again in 1937, to <em>Western Washington College of Education</em> when it became a 4-year college.
Twenty-four years later it became <em>Western Washington State College</em> and finally, in 1977, the institution gained university status.</p>
<p>The 1960s was a period of especially rapid growth for Western, as its enrollment increased from 3,000 students to over 10,000 during the decade.
Also during this time, <a>Fairhaven College</a> was founded (1967), with non-traditional education methods that would serve as a model for <a>The Evergreen State College</a> in <a>Olympia, Washington</a>.
Two years later, the Huxley College of the Environment was founded, continuing Western's trend toward &quot;cluster&quot; colleges.
That same year, on a spring afternoon, students gained headlines by blocking <a>Interstate 5</a> to protest the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
</p>
<p>Since this period, the College of Arts and Sciences was founded (1973) and divided into the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and the College of Sciences &amp;  Technology (2003); the College of Fine and Performing Arts was formed from several art departments (1975); and the College of Business and Economics was established (1976).
During the 1999&#x2013;2000 school year, Western celebrated its <a>Centennial</a>.
</p>
<p>Today, WWU has a major presence in Bellingham's economy, and contributes significantly to the political, social, and artistic aspects of the city.
With a student body that currently consists of over 13,000 students, the university is the third largest in Washington after Washington State University at about 26,000 students and the University of Washington at about 43,000 students both undergraduate and graduate.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Fisher Fountain</a> WWU's scenic location in Bellingham, a rapidly-growing city of about 80,000 people, overlooks <a>Bellingham Bay</a> and many of <a>Puget Sound</a>&#x2019;s 172 <a>San Juan Islands</a>.
It was originally built on a <a>peat bog</a>, and due to this and the area's geography, the university has had to address problems from its buildings slowly sinking into the ground.
The university is  north of <a>Seattle</a>,  south of <a>Vancouver</a>, <a>British Columbia</a>, and an hour&#x2019;s drive from 10,778 foot (3285 m) <a>Mount Baker</a>.
The university is located close to <a>Interstate 5</a>.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|Wilson Library</a>The campus is 215 acres (870,000 m&#x00b2;), including the 38 acre (154,000 m&#x00b2;) Sehome Arboretum, operated jointly with the city of Bellingham.
Western also has off-campus facilities at Shannon Point Marine Center in <a>Anacortes, Washington</a>; Lakewood, a 15 acre (61,000 m&#x00b2;) student-university facility at nearby <a>Lake Whatcom</a>; and <a>Whatcom County</a> property used for environmental and aquatic analyses.</p>
