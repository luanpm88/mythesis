The <strong>School of the Art Institute of Chicago</strong> (<strong>SAIC</strong>) is one of America's largest accredited independent schools of art and design, located in the <a>Loop</a> in <a>Chicago</a>, <a>Illinois</a>.
It is associated with <a>the museum of the same name</a>, and &quot;The Art Institute of Chicago&quot; or &quot;Chicago Art Institute&quot; often refers to either entity.
Providing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels, SAIC has been recognized by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> as one of the top graduate art programs in the nation, as well as by <a>Columbia University</a>&#x2019;s National Arts Journalism survey as the most influential art school in the United States.</p>
<p>SAIC offers classes in art and technology; arts administration; art history, theory, and criticism; art education and art therapy; ceramics; fashion design; filmmaking; historic preservation; architecture; interior architecture; painting and drawing; performance; photography; printmaking; sculpture; sound; time arts (time-based media); video; visual communication; and writing.
SAIC also serves as a resource for issues related to the position and importance of the arts in society.</p>
<p>SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, by the <a>National Association of Schools of Art and Design</a> since 1944 (charter member), and by the <a>Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design</a> (AICAD) since its founding in 1991.
It is accreditated by the <a>National Architectural Accrediting Board</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Its downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the AIC <a>building</a>.
SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institute has its roots with the 1866 founding of the <strong>Chicago Academy of Design</strong>, which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street, financed by member dues and patron donations.
Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the great Chicago fire of 1871.
In response to financial and managerial problems, business leaders in 1878 formed a board of trustees that then founded the <strong>Chicago Academy of Fine Arts</strong>, whose mission expanded from education and exhibitions to include collecting.
In 1882, the academy rechristened itself the <strong>Art Institute of Chicago</strong>, with banker <a>Charles L. Hutchinson</a> as its elected president until his death in 1924.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>SAIC offers a broad range of fine arts degrees and is interdisciplinary; a selected course of concentration is not necessary unless enrolled in the AIADO department.</p>

<p>SAIC does not utilize a standard grading system.
All academics are marked as credit no credit meaning C or above is pass, and below a C is fail.</p>
<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<p>The main campus is set in downtown Chicago, also known as <a>the Loop</a>.
SAIC uses three main buildings which are the Michigan (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Sharp (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.).
SAIC also has additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used student galleries or investments.</p>
<h3>Visiting Artists Program</h3>
<p>Founded in 1868, the <strong>Visiting Artists Program (VAP)</strong> is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Formalized in 1951 with the establishment of an endowed fund by Flora Mayer Witkowsky, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings.
It is a decidedly eclectic program that showcases artists working in all media including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film, in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the Visiting Artists Program is to educate and foster a greater understanding and appreciation of contemporary art through discourse.
VAP maintains a long-standing commitment to ethnic and gender diversity and has been at the forefront of the movement toward a more socially engaged and theoretically informed aesthetic dialogue.</p>
<p>Recent visiting artists have included <a>Richard Tuttle</a>, <a>Andrea Fraser</a>, <a>Omer Fast</a>, <a>Rirkrit Tiravanija</a>, <a>DJ Spooky</a>, <a>Kalup Linzy</a>, <a>Elizabeth Peyton</a>, <a>Mel Chin</a>, <a>Thomas Hirschhorn</a>, <a>Raymond Pettibon</a>, <a>Rodney Graham</a>, <a>Isaac Julien</a>, <a>Dave Hickey</a>, <a>Vito Acconci</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped who they are today.
Recent alumni speakers include Joe Zucker, Sanford Biggers, Suzie Silver, and Joshua Mosley, to name a few.</p>
<h3>Galleries</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Betty Rymer Gallery</strong> - The Betty Rymer gallery is named in honor of Betty Rymer, the late wife of SAIC Board of Governors member Barry Rymer.
In 1989, Mr. Rymer made a major contribution to SAIC's Advancement Program and the gallery is a dedication to her memory and interests.
It is located in the 280 South Columbus Drive building.</li>
<li><strong>Sullivan Galleries (formerly Gallery 2)</strong> - Relocated to the 7th floor of the Sullivan Center in 2008, Gallery 2 was an off-site space offered through their 847 West Jackson Avenue building.
Its former location did not lend itself to high traffic, and the new location at 36 S. Wabash, in the midst of the SAIC &quot;campus&quot;, features updated and more accessible facilities.
It is run by the school's non-teaching faculty and student workers.
The gallery also annually hosts the Undergraduate and Graduate Thesis exhibitions (respectively, the BFA, MFA, and Graduate Design Exhibitions).
During the rest of the year, it features highly advanced undergraduate and graduate student shows, as well as professionally-curated exhibitions.</li>
<li><strong>Student Union Galleries (LG Space, Gallery X)</strong> - The Student Union Galleries (SUGs) is SAIC's fully student-run gallery system.
Paid student directors maintain the galleries with assistance from a faculty adviser.
A volunteer student committee assists in maintenance and the selection of exhibitions.
They have two locations: LG Space of the 37 South Wabash Avenue building; and Gallery X of the 280 South Columbus Drive building.
The two locations allow the galleries to cycle two shows simultaneously, each with three shows per semester.
They also maintain their own website.[<a>http://www.sugs.info/</a>]</li>

<h4>Student Government</h4>
<p>The student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution resembles a socialist republic, in which four officers hold equal power and responsibility.
Elections are held every year.
There are no campaign requirements.
Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.</p>
<p>The student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month.
At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature.
The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations.
Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not.
The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.</p>
<p>The student government is also responsible for the distribution of the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Fund, Welcome Back to School Party, Monthly Morning Coffees, Open Forums, Barbecues in the Pit (the outdoor area at the entrance of the 280 S Columbus Building), Holiday Art Sale, and a Materials Event.
In the past Student Government has accomplished such things as campus-wide recycling, and access to the <a>Chicago Transit Authority</a>'s <a>U-Pass</a>.</p>

<h2>Controversy</h2>
<h3>&quot;Mirth &amp; Girth&quot;</h3>
<p> On May 11,&nbsp;1988, a student painting of <a>Harold Washington</a>, the first black mayor of Chicago, was torn down by some of the city's African-American <a>aldermen</a> &#x2014; over the protests of many who attempted to block them &#x2014; based on its content.
The painting, titled &quot;Mirth &amp; Girth&quot; by David Nelson, was of Washington clad only in women's underwear holding a pencil.
Washington had died on November 25,&nbsp;1987.</p>
<p>The painting was returned after a day, and the <a>American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen.
The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights.
Nelson ended up receiving a monetary settlement for damage to the painting which occurred during its confiscation.</p>
<h3>&quot;What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?&quot;</h3>
<p>In February&nbsp;1989, a student named &quot;Dread&quot; Scott Tyler draped the American flag across the floor for a piece titled &quot;What Is The Proper Way To Display A U.S. Flag?&quot;
The piece consisted of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit.
However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor.
In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag.
Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans.</p>
