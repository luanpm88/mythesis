<p>The university was founded in March 1863 when the Kansas Legislature passed the enabling act to establish the <strong>Kansas State Normal School</strong>.
The school's first graduating class consisted of two women in 1867, the year the first permanent building was completed.</p>
<p>In 1876, the Kansas Legislature passed the &quot;Miscellaneous appropriations bill of 1876&quot;.
The end result was that <a>Leavenworth Normal</a> and <a>Concordia Normal</a> were closed so the state funding for normal schools could be directed to Emporia.</p>
<p>In February 1923, the name of the school was changed to the <strong>Kansas State Teachers College</strong>.
In July 1974, the name was changed to <strong>Emporia Kansas State College</strong>.
