<p><strong>Glasgow School of Art</strong> (GSA) is one of only two independent art schools in Scotland, situated in the <a>Garnethill</a> area of <a>Glasgow</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1845 as the <strong>Glasgow Government School of Design</strong>, one of the first <a>Government Schools of Design</a>.
In 1853 it changed its name to The Glasgow School of Art.
Initially it was located at 12 Ingram Street, but in 1869 it moved to the <a>McLellan Galleries</a>.
In 1897 work started on a new building to house the school on Renfrew Street.
The building was designed by <a>Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a>, chosen for the commission by the school's director, <a>Francis Newbery</a>, who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation.
The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second in 1909.
The School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building.
The Phase 1 building is opposite the Mackintosh Building on a site now occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.
The competition was won by New York based <a>Steven Holl</a> Architects  working with Glasgow Architects JM Architects.</p>
<p>The school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30% of <a>Turner Prize</a> nominees and two of the last five <a>Turner Prize</a> winners: <a>Simon Starling</a> in 2005 and <a>Richard Wright</a> in 2009.
</p>
<p>Departments include Fine Art photography, founded by <a>Thomas Joshua Cooper</a> in 1982, Painting and Printmaking,Sculpture and Environmental Art, Product Design, Product Design Engineering, Textiles, Silversmithing and Jewellery, Interior Design, Visual Communication and architecture.
The School of Architecture is named after GSA's most famous alumnus <a>Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a> and highly rated by the architecture profession.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Arts, Mackintosh produced one of his purest works.
<a>Queen's Cross Church</a>, in Maryhill, Glasgow is still a hidden gem, one of the artist's most mysterious works, which was built between 1897 and 1899.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Western facade of GSA's Mackintosh building</a> The school is currently situated in a compact <a>campus</a>, spread across 10 buildings, in the centre of Glasgow, north of <a>Sauchiehall Street</a> with the exception of the school's digital design studio which is situated at Pacific Quay.</p>
<p>The Mackintosh Building is the heart of the campus and continues to be a functioning part of the school.
It primarily houses the <a>Fine Art</a> Painting department, the Interior Design department, first year studios and administrative staff.
It also houses the Mackintosh gallery which holds many different exhibitions throughout the year.
The gallery is the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas are of the school are only viewable by guided tour.
An exception to this rule is the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building are opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks.
</p>
<p>Directly opposite the Mackintosh Building are the Newbery Tower, Foulis Building and Assembly Building.
The Newbery Tower houses the Textiles, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing departments and the Refectory cafeteria, a second branch of Where the Monkey Sleeps, a city centre cafe and restaurant run by three ex-graduates.
The Foulis has the Product Design Engineering, Product Design, Visual Communications departments and the Centre for Advanced Textiles.</p>
<p>The Richmond Building is home to the Fine Art photography department.
Connected to the Richmond Building is the John D. Kelly Building which houses the printmaking department, as well as the first year design programme.</p>
<p>The <a>Mackintosh School of Architecture</a> and the school's library are situated in The Bourdon Building.</p>
<p>The Barnes Building on West Graham Street is the base for the MFA and Sculpture and environmental art studios.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Currently, the GSA is planning on developing the current <a>Garnethill</a> campus.
The Mackintosh building will still be centrepiece of the campus, though there are plans to sell off some of the more peripheral buildings and to redevelop the Newbery site.
The building which houses the Assembly Building adjacent to the Mackintosh Building will be redeveloped and retain its existing facade.
As part of the planned expansion, the art school have taken control of Glasgow City Council's <a>McLellan Galleries</a>.
</p>
<p>An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and first building.
The competition was won by New York based <a>Steven Holl</a>Architects  working with Glasgow Architects JM Architects.</p>
<p>GSA has a research and postgraduate digital design studio (DDS) based on the southside of Glasgow in a new facility at <a>Pacific Quay</a> by the <a>River Clyde</a> in a building called The Hub.</p>
