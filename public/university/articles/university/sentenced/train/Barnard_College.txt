<p>  <strong>Barnard College</strong> is an independently incorporated <a>women's</a> <a>liberal arts college</a>, an official college of <a>Columbia University</a>, and a member of the <a>Seven Sisters</a>.
Founded in 1889, Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Barnard Hall</a> Barnard was founded to provide an <a>education for women</a> comparable to that of Columbia and other <a>Ivy League</a> schools, most of which admitted only men for undergraduate study into the 1960s.
The college was named after <a>Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard</a>, an American educator and mathematician, who served as the president of the then-<a>Columbia College</a> from 1864 to 1889.
Frederick Barnard advocated equal educational privileges for men and women, preferably in a coeducational setting.
The school's founding, however, is largely due to the efforts of <a>Annie Nathan Meyer</a>, a student and writer who was not satisfied with Columbia's effort to educate women.</p>
<p>Barnard's original 1889 home was a rented <a>brownstone</a> at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 &quot;specials&quot;, who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science.
When Columbia University announced in 1892 its impending move to Morningside Heights, Barnard built a new campus on 119th-120th Streets with gifts from Mary E. Brinckerhoff, <a>Elizabeth Milbank Anderson</a> and Martha T. Fiske.
As the college grew it needed additional space, and in 1903 it received the three blocks south of 119th Street from Anderson who had purchased a former portion of the Bloomingdale Asylum site from the New York Hospital.</p>
<h2>Relationship with Columbia University</h2>
<p>Barnard degrees are awarded by Columbia University, In 1900, Barnard formalized an affiliation with the university which made available to its students the instruction and facilities of Columbia.</p>
<p>Despite the affiliation Barnard is legally and financially separate from Columbia, with an independent faculty and board of trustees.
It is responsible for its own separate admissions, health, security, guidance and placement services, and has its own alumnae association.
Nonetheless, Barnard students participate in the academic, social, athletic and extracurricular life of the broader University community on a reciprocal basis.
Most Columbia classes are open to Barnard students and vice versa, Barnard students and faculty are represented in the University Senate, and student clubs such as the <em><a>Columbia Daily Spectator</a></em> are open to all students.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|thumb|A view of Milbank Hall, Barnard College</a> Admissions to Barnard College is considered most selective by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>, which most recently ranked the school as the 26th best liberal college in the <a>United States</a>.
Barnard College is the most selective women's college in the nation;</p>
<p>For the class of 2011, Barnard College admitted 28.7% of those who applied.
The median <a>ACT</a> score was 30, while the median combined <a>SAT</a> score was 2100.
For the class of 2012, the admission &lt;!-- their web site calls it an &quot;admit rate,&quot;--&gt; rate was 28.5% of the 4,273 applications received.
The early-decision admission rate was 47.7%, out of 392 applications.
The median SAT Combined was 2060, with median subscores of 660 in Math, 690 in Critical Reading, and 700 in Writing.
The Median ACT score was 30.
Of the women in the class of 2012, 89.4% ranked in first or second decile at their high school (of the 41.3% ranked by their schools).
The average <a>GPA</a> of the class of 2012 was 94.3 on a 100-point scale and 3.88 on a 4.0 scale.</p>
<h2>Barnard Library</h2>
<p>Barnard's Wollman Library is located in <a>Adele Lehman Hall</a>.
Its collection includes over 200,000 volumes which support the undergraduate curriculum.
It also houses an archival collection of official and student publications, photographs, letters and other material that documents Barnard&#x2019;s history from its founding in 1889 to the present day.
Barnard's rare books collections include the Overbury Collection, the personal library of <a>Nobel</a> prize-winning poet <a>Gabriela Mistral</a>, and a small collection of other rare books.
The Overbury Collection consists of 3,300 items, including special and first edition books as well as manuscript materials by and about American women authors.
Alumnae Books is a collection of books donated by Barnard alumnae authors.
Conflicting accounts list either Richard B. Snow or Philip M. Chu as the architect of Lehman Hall... as well as of the <a>Amherst College</a> library and one of the libraries at <a>Princeton University</a>.
The  building opened in 1959.</p>
<h3>Barnard Library Zine Collection</h3>
<p>Barnard collects <a>zine</a>s in an effort to document the <a>third-wave feminism</a> and <a>Riot Grrrl</a> culture.
The Zine Collection complements Barnard's <a>women's studies</a> research holdings because it gives room to voices of girls and women otherwise under or not at all represented in the book stacks.
According to its <a>Library collection development</a> policy, Barnard's zines are &quot;written by New York City and other urban women with an emphasis on zines by women of color.
(In this case the word <em>woman</em> includes anyone who identifies as female and some who don't believe in <a>binary gender</a>.)
The zines are personal and political publications on <a>activism</a>, <a>anarchism</a>, <a>body image</a>, third wave feminism, <a>gender</a>, <a>parenting</a>, <a>queer community</a>, riotgrrrl, <a>sexual assault</a>, and other topics.&quot;</p>
<p>Barnard's collection documents movements and trends in <a>feminist</a> thought through the personal work of artists, writers, and activists.
Currently, the Barnard Zine Collection has over 2,000 items, including zines about <a>race</a>, gender, <a>sexuality</a>, <a>childbirth</a>, <a>mother</a>hood, <a>politics</a>, and <a>relationships</a>. Barnard attempts to collect two copies of each zine, one of which circulates with the second copy archived for <a>preservation</a>.
To facilitate <a>circulation</a>, Barnard zines are <a>cataloged</a> in CLIO (the Columbia/Barnard <a>OPAC</a>) and <a>OCLC</a>'s <a>Worldcat</a>.</p>
<h2>Culture and student life</h2>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Barnard College Greek Games statue</a> Every Barnard student is part of the <a>Student Government Association</a> (SGA), which elects a representative <a>student government</a>.
Students serve with faculty and administrators on college committees and help to shape policy in a wide variety of areas.</p>
<p>Student groups include <a>theatre</a> and vocal music groups, language clubs, <a>literary magazines</a>, a biweekly magazine called the <em>Barnard Bulletin</em>, community service groups, and others.
Barnard students can also join <a>extracurricular activities</a> or organizations at Columbia University, while Columbia University students are allowed in most, but not all, Barnard organizations.</p>
<p>Barnard's McIntosh Activities Council (commonly known as McAC), named after the first President of Barnard, Millicent Mcintosh, organizes various community focused events on campus, such as Big Sub and <a>Midnight Breakfast</a>.
McAC is made up of five sub-committees which are the Multi-Cultural committee, the Time-Out committee, the Network committee, the Community committee, and the Action committee.
Each committee has a different focus, such as hosting and publicizing multi-cultural events (Multi-Cultural), having regular study breaks and relaxation events (Time-Out), giving students opportunities to be involved with Alumnae and various professionals (Network), planning events that bring the entire student body together (Community), and planning community service events that give back to the surrounding community (Action).</p>
<p>Two <a>National Panhellenic Conference</a> organizations were founded at Barnard College.
<a>Alpha Omicron Pi</a> Fraternity, was founded on January 2, 1897, the <a>Alpha Epsilon Phi</a>, founded on October 24, 1909, though both are no longer on campus.
Barnard students now participate in four National Panhellenic Conference sororities - <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a>, <a>Delta Gamma</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a>Sigma Delta Tau</a>.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every April, Barnard and Columbia students participate in the <a>Take Back the Night</a> march and speak-out.
This annual event grew out of a 1988 <a>Seven Sisters</a> conference.
The march has grown from under 200 participants in 1988 to more than 2,500 in 2007.</li>
<li><a>Midnight Breakfast</a> marks the beginning of finals week.
As a highly popular event and long-standing college tradition, Midnight Breakfast is hosted by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).
In addition to providing standard breakfast foods, each year's theme is also incorporated into the menu.
Past themes have included &quot;I YUMM the 90s,&quot; &quot;Grease,&quot; and &quot;Take me out to the ballgame.&quot;
The event is a school-wide affair as college deans, trustees and the President, <a>Debora Spar</a>, serve food to about a thousand students.
It takes place the night before finals begin every semester.</li>
<li>On Spirit Day, there is a large barbecue, the deans serve <a>ice cream</a> to students, different activities are hosted, and the whole student body celebrates.
The school sells &quot;I Love BC&quot; T-shirts, and gives out free Barnard products.
The event is run by the Spirit Day Planning Committee which is chaired by the Programming Officer of the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council) and the Representative for Community Affairs of the Student Government Association (SGA).</li>
<li>During the fall semester, students help to construct and then <a>consume</a> a <a>mile</a>-long <a>sandwich</a> known as &quot;The big sub&quot;.
Every year another foot is added onto the sub as it stretches across campus.
The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).</li>
<li>In the spring of each year, Barnard holds the Night Carnival, in which many of Barnard's student groups set up tables with games and prizes.
The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Barnard athletes compete in the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> Division I and the <a>Ivy League</a> through the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium.
There are 15 <a>intercollegiate teams</a>, and students also compete at the <a>intramural</a> and club levels.
From 1975-1983, before the establishment of the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, Barnard students competed as the &quot;Barnard Bears&quot;.
Prior to 1975, students referred to themselves as the &quot;Barnard honeybears&quot;.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>Barnard College has issued a statement affirming its commitment to <a>environmental sustainability</a>, a major part of which is the goal of reducing its <a>greenhouse gas</a> emissions by 30% by 2017.
Student EcoReps work as a resource on environmental issues for students in Barnard's residence halls, while the student-run Earth Coalition works on outreach initiatives such as local park clean-ups, tutoring elementary school students in environmental education, and sponsoring environmental forums.
Barnard earned a &quot;C-&quot; for its sustainability efforts on the <a>College Sustainability Report Card</a> 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.
Its highest marks were in Student Involvement and Food and Recycling, receiving a &quot;B&quot; in both categories.</p>
<h2>Nine Ways of Knowing</h2>
<p>Nine Ways of Knowing are liberal arts requirements.
Students must take one year of one laboratory science, study a single foreign language for four semesters, and complete one 3-credit course in each of the following categories: reason and value, social analysis, historical studies, cultures in comparison, quantitative and deductive reasoning, literature, and visual and performing arts.
The use of AP or IB credit to fulfill these requirements is very limited, but Nine Ways of Knowing courses may overlap with major or minor requirements.
In addition to the Nine Ways of Knowing, students must complete a first-year seminar, a first-year English course, and two semesters of physical education.</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1960 Columbia University President Grayson Kirk complained to the President of Barnard that Barnard students were wearing inappropriate clothing.
The garments in question were pants and Bermuda shorts.
The administration forced the Student Council to institute a dress code.
Students would be allowed to wear shorts and pants only at Barnard and only if the shorts were no more than two inches above the knee and the pants were not tight.
Barnard women crossing the street to enter the Columbia campus wearing shorts or pants were required to cover themselves with a long coat similar to a <a>jilbab</a>.</p>
<p>In March 1968, <em><a>The New York Times</a></em> ran an article on students who cohabited, identifying one of the persons they interviewed as a student at Barnard College from New Hampshire named &quot;Susan&quot;.
Barnard officials searched their records for women from New Hampshire and were able to determine that &quot;Susan&quot; was the pseudonym of a student (Linda LeClair) who was living with her boyfriend, a student at Columbia University.
She was called before Barnard's student-faculty administration judicial committee, where she faced the possibility of expulsion.
A student protest included a petition signed by 300 other Barnard women, admitting that they too had broken the regulations against cohabitating.
The judicial committee reached a compromise and the student was allowed to remain in school, but was denied use of the college cafeteria and barred from all social activities.
The student briefly became a focus of intense national attention.
She eventually dropped out of Barnard.</p>
