<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|250px|Map of North Carolina highlighting Jackson County, NC</a></p>
<p>Western Carolina University is located in <a>Jackson County</a>, in the <a>unincorporated</a> <a>village</a> of <a>Cullowhee, North Carolina</a>.
The university operates satellite campuses in both <a>Asheville</a> and <a>Cherokee</a> with programs offered online and at various <a>community colleges</a>.
The main campus is located in a valley of the <a>Tuckasegee River</a> between the <a>Blue Ridge</a> and <a>Great Smoky Mountains</a>,  west of <a>Asheville, North Carolina</a> and 5 miles south of <a>Sylva, NC</a>.
The university lies close to the <a>Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a>, the <a>Blue Ridge Parkway</a>, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Reservation (officially known as the <a>Qualla Boundary</a>) and some of the nation's most beautiful <a>national forest</a> lands.
At an elevation of , but located in a thermal valley, the campus enjoys the best of all four seasons but is shielded from most extreme temperatures by surrounding peaks.
Cullowhee typically enjoys a rather mild winter season, in fact, Cullowhee can go some winters without snowfall or with just a trace.</p>
<p>While winters in the valley are generally mild, snow is not unusual in the higher elevations of Jackson County around <a>Cashiers</a> or <a>Balsam</a>.
In nearby Sapphire Valley, snowmaking machines maintain prime snow skiing conditions from mid-December through February.
Locations in Jackson County are also within reasonable driving distance to ski slopes at <a>Maggie Valley</a>.
The Blue Ridge Parkway is usually closed during winter weather, and has become popular with cross country skiiers during those times.</p>
<p>The many rivers, streams and forests surrounding Cullowhee, combined with the mild climate of Southern Appalachia, offer many opportunities for outdoor activities.
Climbing, hiking, biking, rafting, kayaking, and camping are a few of the outdoor activities nearby.
Cities within a three hour drive of campus include Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|The Joyner Building served as a combination classroom and administration facility</a> In 1888, the citizens of Cullowhee desired a better school for the community than was offered in public schools of that day, organized a board of trustees and established a community school that came to be known as <strong>Cullowhee Academy</strong>.
Founded in August 1889 as a semi-public secondary school and chartered as Cullowhee High School in 1891 (also called Cullowhee Academy), it served the Cullowhee community and boarding students from neighboring counties and other states.
The founder, Robert Lee Madison, wanted to provide an education for the young people in the region and train teachers to spread education throughout the Western Carolina part of the state.
In 1893, through the efforts of Walter E. Moore, representative from Jackson County, the North Carolina Legislature authorized an appropriation for the establishment of a normal department at the school &quot;for the purpose of training teachers&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1905, the state assumed title to the school&#x2019;s buildings and property and made it a state institution.
That same year, the school&#x2019;s name was changed to <strong>Cullowhee Normal &amp; Industrial School</strong>.
In 1925, the school&#x2019;s name was changed to <strong>Cullowhee State Normal School</strong>.
During its years as Cullowhee Normal, the stated purpose of the school was to train teachers for the North Carolina public schools.
A coeducational institution, Cullowhee Normal trained over two thousand teachers by the mid-1920s.</p>
<p>Over the next forty years, the school expanded its curriculum and evolved into a junior college, and in 1929 it was chartered by the legislature as a four-year institution under the name <strong>Western Carolina Teachers College.</strong>
Called &quot;the Cullowhee experiment&quot;, Madison&#x2019;s idea became a model for the other regional colleges in the state.
On July 1, 1972, WCU became a member of the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.</p>
