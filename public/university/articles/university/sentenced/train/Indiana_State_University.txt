<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Fairbanks Hall Dome</a> Indiana State University was established by the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a> on December 20, 1865, as the <strong>Indiana State Normal School</strong> in <a>Terre Haute</a>.
As the State Normal School, its core mission was to educate elementary and high school teachers.
The school awarded its first baccalaureate degrees in 1908 and the first master's degrees in 1928.
In 1929, the Indiana State Normal School was renamed the <strong>Indiana State Teachers College</strong>, and in 1961, was renamed <strong>Indiana State College</strong> due to an expanding mission.
In 1965, the Indiana General Assembly renamed the college as <strong>Indiana State University</strong> in recognition of continued growth.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Rankin Hall</a></p>
<p>The Indiana State University main campus is located on the north side of Terre Haute&#x2019;s downtown business district and covers more than  in the heart of the city.
Over 60 brick and limestone buildings and laboratories comprise the main campus.
Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1990s, ISU lost many of its historic buildings, but efforts  to beautify the campus continue: a section of Seventh Street that runs by the university has been converted into a boulevard with flower beds and antique light posts; the old power plant was razed in 2002 and replaced with a modern facility; <a>Stalker Hall</a> reopened in fall 2005 after a complete renovation; Normal Hall, a Neo-Classic building erected in 1909, originally served as the library, and is line for renovation in 2011-12.
In 2009, the university dedicated a more than 109,000-square-foot Student Recreation Center, financed via private funding and student fees.
Also in 2009, the College of Education was relocated to the newly renovated, historic University Hall.
Beginning in 2012, the College of Business will relocate to the renovated Terre Haute Federal Building, a classic Art Deco building erected in 1933.
</p>
<p>The Indiana State University field campus is an outdoor teaching, learning, and research area designed to accommodate educational programs and services.
The field campus is located on 93 scenic acres approximately  east of Terre Haute near <a>Brazil, Indiana</a>, and includes eight man-made lakes.</p>
<h3>2010 Master Plan</h3>

Primary components of the plan include: &#x2022; Meeting the functional needs of academic programs within the current facility square footage.

<h2>University traditions</h2>
<h3>Donaghy Day</h3>
<p>Named for Fred Donaghy, graduate of the Normal School (1912) and a professor of life sciences, this tradition was initiated in 1976 as a day set aside for the community to celebrate the season and to work to help beautify the campus and surrounding community; Donaghy Day is now conducted during the first week of the fall semester and is used to acquaint new students with the university's commitment to community engagement.</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>The term Homecoming was first used in print announcements for the Alumni-Varsity Basketball Game on December 9, 1916.
By 1919, this event became known as Blue and White Day and featured dances and entertainment for alumni of the Normal School.
In 1921 the events were organized around a football game scheduled earlier in the autumn.
A bonfire and pep rally were added to the festivities in 1922; the Blue-and-White Parade in 1923; and in 1937, Bette Whitmore (Kappa Kappa) was elected ISU&#x00b9;s first Homecoming Queen.</p>
<h3>Founders Day</h3>
<p>Conducted in January or February of each year, this event commemorates the opening of the institution in 1870 when 23 students presented themselves to a faculty of three on the first day of classes at the Indiana State Normal School.
</p>
<h3>Mascots</h3>
<p>The school has had two mascots.
Early on in the school's history, the athletes were referred to as the &quot;Fighting Teachers&quot;, until the students chose the name &quot;Sycamores&quot;, from the abundance of Sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the <a>Wabash River</a> Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on 'Sycamores' on a lark, never thinking it would win.
During the 1950s and 60s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State's mascot.
However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State's in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named Chief Quabachi, and his Princess, in 1969.
This change paid homage to the fact that ISU was the &quot;State&quot; university of a state named after Indians (prior to statehood Indiana was primarily inhabited by Indians).
However, the university bowed to political correctness and stopped using Chief Quabachi as a mascot in 1989.
For six years, Indiana State did not have a mascot, until 1995, a blue-and-white &quot;furry woodland creature&quot; named &quot;Sycamore Sam&quot; was developed to replace Chief Quabachi and continues to serve as Indiana State's mascot.</p>
<h3>Tandem</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Tandem race</a> This student-organized race was first run as part of Spring Week activities in 1970.
Teams are coed mixed pairs, which compete on tandem bicycles.</p>
<h3>Trike</h3>
<p>The <strong>Indiana State Tricycle Derby</strong> was first run in 1963 as a 10-lap race around the sidewalks of the Quadrangle on children's tricycles.
The races featured a men's and women's division (the Powder Puff Derby).
The races now feature men's and women's teams racing on specially built tricycles at the new Recreation East complex at Ninth and Sycamore streets.
In October 2005, the Michael Simmons Student Activity Center opened at Rec East, featuring commemorative displays chronicling the history and the participants of trike and tandem, containing bleacher seating, an all-purpose room, restrooms, an observation deck, and storage.
</p>
<h3>The Walk</h3>
<p>The unofficial tradition during homecoming is known as &quot;The Walk.&quot;
A large number of students, typically reaching in the thousands, make the two mile (3&nbsp;km) walk east on Wabash Avenue towards the Football Stadium (approximately two miles) stopping and having a drink at each bar along the way.
In 2010, the university launched &#x201c;SoberRide&#x201d; and &#x201c;Designated Walker&#x201d; programs for homecoming.
</p>
<p>The Walk can be traced back to the early 1980s when students walked from Saturday night football games back to campus, stopping for a beer at every establishment that served beer, including the Pizza Hut, on Wabash.</p>
<h2>Songs</h2>
<h3>Fight Song</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Marching Sycamores</a> <em>March On (You Fighting Sycamores)</em>, the university&#x2019;s fight song, was authored and arranged by Joseph A. Gramelspacher, an ISU professor of music, as a pep song.
It was first performed at a homecoming-eve pep rally on October 20, 1939.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana State&lt;BR&gt; &quot;March On! (You Fighting Sycamores)&quot; :March on!
March on, you fighting Sycamores, Sycamores!
:March on, you Statesmen tried and true! :March on!
March on to glorious victory :Raise that flag of royal blue! :March on!
March on, you fighting Sycamores, Sycamores!
:Shout out that vict'ry song! :Onward, ever onward to our goal!
:As we march on and on!
:<em>Go Big Blue!
Fight Big Blue!</em> :<em>GO!
STATE!
WIN!</em></p>
<h3>Alma Mater</h3>
<p>Charles M. Curry, Professor of English and Literature authored <em>The Alma Mater</em>.
It was originally entitled, &quot;Indiana&#x2019;s Normal&quot; and first printed in a June 1912 issue of the <em>Normal Advance</em>.
Dr. Curry used the music of <a>Annie Lisle</a> for <em>The Alma Mater</em>.</p>
