<p><strong>Northern Michigan University</strong> is a 4 year college <a>public university</a> established in 1899 located in <a>Marquette</a>, in <a>Michigan</a>'s <a>Upper Peninsula</a>.
With a population of nearly 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students, Northern Michigan University is the Upper Peninsula's largest university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Dating back to 1907 and originally located on the corner of Kaye and Presque Isle, the Heart of Northern was long a landmark of NMU.
After falling into a severe state of neglect by the end of the 20th century, a new mound was created closer to the center of campus in time for its Centennial Celebration in 1999.</a></p>
<p>Northern Michigan University, NMU for short, was established in 1899 by the <a>Michigan Legislature</a> as Northern State Normal School with the original purpose of providing teacher preparation programs in Michigan's then-wild and sparsely populated <a>Upper Peninsula</a>.
When it opened its doors in 1899, Northern enrolled thirty-two students who were taught by six faculty members utilizing rented rooms in Marquette City Hall.
The original  campus-site at the corner of Presque Isle and Kaye Avenues was on land donated by local businessman and philanthropist John M. Longyear, whose namesake academic building, Longyear Hall, opened its doors to students in 1900.</p>
<p>Throughout the school's first half century, education and teacher training was the primary focus of the small regional school.
During this time, the school built the native sandstone buildings Kaye and Peter White Halls, as well as a manual training school adjacent to the campus buildings, J.D. Pierce School.
Modest increases in enrollment resulted in several name changes throughout the years: &lt;br&gt;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Northern State Normal, 1899</li>
  <li>Northern State Teachers College, 1927</li>
  <li>Northern Michigan College of Education, 1942</li>
  <li>Northern Michigan College, 1955</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1963, through the adoption of a new state constitution in Michigan, Northern was designated as a comprehensive university serving the diverse educational needs of Upper Michigan.
During this time, enrollment at the small state school swelled (due in large part to the opening in 1957 of the Mackinac Straits Bridge, linking the Upper and Lower Peninsulas to vehicle traffic) and as a result, the campus expanded rapidly; roughly to the size it remains to this day.
Accredited undergraduate and graduate degree programs are offered by the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Professional Studies.
</p>
<p>Graduate education was inaugurated in 1928 when courses at the master&#x2019;s degree level were offered in cooperation with the <a>University of Michigan</a>.
In 1960, Northern established its own graduate program.</p>
<h2>Academic profile</h2>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>The Teaching, Learning, and Communication (TLC) initiative places a notebook computer in the hands of every full-time undergraduate student and faculty.
This initiative makes NMU one of the largest public university <a>laptop</a> programs in the world.
Laptop program participants receive a new notebook computer every two years.
Northern&#x2019;s campus-wide effort for technological mastery helps NMU students compete in the high-tech global marketplace after they graduate.
The university has national and international awards for its innovative work in the area of technology in higher education.</p>
<h3>Vision of the initiative</h3>
<p>Northern Michigan University's vision for education in the 21st century is a learning environment that embraces technology to enhance student access, promote the development of independent learners and encourage greater student-faculty communication and collaboration.
To help achieve this vision, the university implemented a laptop program in the fall of 2000 that ensures students and faculty have a standard set of tools (hardware and software) that meet a majority of their computing and telecommunications needs, promotes communication and enables quality support.
NMU is the first public university in Michigan &mdash; but one of many nationwide &mdash; to pursue the idea of a &quot;laptop&quot; campus.
</p>
<p>Since 2002, most of the campus and surrounding city is covered by a wireless network.
Although electronic documents are encouraged, networked printers are installed in various campus locations for hard copy documents.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 2009 the university initiated a <a>WiMAX</a> connection initiative.
This far reaching technology has brought internet access to students off and on campus.
It was the first educational facility to create such an initiative and an example of Northern's vision for the future.</p>
<p>The university has a help desk and walk-in service center to handle laptop maintenance problems.</p>
<h3>Cost to students</h3>
<p>NMU leases the laptop computers and issues them to full-time students on a two-year replacement cycle (a student will never have a computer more than two years old).
Continuing students who pre-register for the following fall will be able to use the laptop through the summer at no additional charge.
</p>
<p>Part-time students may, at their option, participate in the program.
Part-time students may also, for a fee, check out the laptops from the library on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Additional aspects</h3>
<p>NMU continues to support and improve &quot;specialty labs&quot; as a function of need and resource availability.
These are labs designed to meet the needs of specific academic programs that have special equipment and software needs (e.g., graphic design, computer science, GIS, CAD among others).
The Center for Instructional Technology in Education (CITE) in the LRC supports faculty use of technology in instruction.</p>

<h3>USOEC</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Opening ceremony at the 2007 'China V. USOEC' challenge.</a></p>
<p>The <a>United States Olympic Education Center</a> on the campus of Northern Michigan University is one of four Olympic training centers in the country and the only one located on a college campus.
The USOEC provides secondary and post-secondary educational opportunities for athletes while offering world-class training.
</p>
<p>With more than 70 resident athletes and coaches, the USOEC is the second-largest Olympic training center in the United States, in terms of residents, behind <a>Colorado Springs</a>.
The USOEC has more residential athletes than the <a>Lake Placid</a> and <a>Chula Vista</a> sites combined.
Over the years, it has grown into a major contributor to the U.S. Olympic movement.</p>
<p>Current resident training programs include boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, short track speed skating, weightlifting, and women&#x2019;s freestyle wrestling.
Athletes must be approved by the USOEC, their national governing body and NMU to be admitted into the program.
</p>
<p>USOEC athletes attend NMU or <a>Marquette Senior High School, Marquette, Michigan</a> while training in their respective sports.
The student athletes receive free or reduced room and board, access to world-class training facilities as well as sports medicine and sports science services, academic tutoring, and a waiver of out-of-state tuition fees by NMU.
Although athletes are responsible for tuition at the in-state rate, they may receive the B.J. Stupak Scholarship to help cover expenses.</p>
<p>On-campus USOEC athletes live in  NMU&#x2019;s  Meyland Hall, eat in campus dining halls, and train at the university&#x2019;s <a>Berry Events Center</a> and <a>Superior Dome</a>.
</p>
<p>The USOEC also offers a variety of short-term training camps; regional, national, and international competitions; coaches and officials education clinics; and an educational program for retired Olympians.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p>Residence hall government is an important facet of student life and NMU.
Ten to twenty students from each of the ten residence halls are elected and/or appointed to meet with the staff from their hall on a weekly basis.
They represent their peers on a variety of matters pertaining to their residence hall community and campus life.</p>
<p>Students who participate in hall government have the option of participating in various leadership training activities.</p>
<p>One student from up campus (2 halls) and two from down campus (8 halls) are elected to serve on ASNMU,  NMU's Student Government.</p>
<p>The ten residence halls are:   <a>thumb|Gant Hall as seen from the courtyard</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gant Hall </li>
  <li>Halverson Hall</li>
  <li>Hunt Hall</li>
  <li>Magers Hall</li>
  <li>Meyland Hall </li>
  <li>Payne Hall </li>
  <li>Spalding Hall </li>
  <li>Spooner Hall </li>
  <li>VanAntwerp Hall </li>
  <li>West Hall</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the residence halls, NMU operates and maintains seven apartment buildings on campus.</p>
<p>The apartments are </p>
<ul>
  <li>Woodland Park (Opened in 2006)</li>
  <li>Lincoln Apartments</li>
  <li>Summit / Center Apartments</li>
  <li>Center / Norwood Apartments</li>
  <li>Norwood Apartments</li>
</ul>
<p>Many halls that have been listed above contain &quot;houses&quot;, smaller communities within each residence hall, which participate in volunteer events and socialize.
Many have long-running traditions.
For example, the men  of Brul&#x00e9; House in Gant Hall run across campus in the nude.
This tradition is called the Brul&#x00e9; Run and happens after the first big snowfall sticks for 24 hours.
The Malibu House in Spalding Hall traditionally flashes the runners through the window as they pass by.
Arctic house takes a swim in Lake Superior in the middle of winter.
This is known as the Arctic plunge.
All the halls host an annual Halloween trick-or-treat opportunity for school-aged kids in Marquette.
Northern Michigan Hall traditions are numerous and are not as revealing as this but these kind of opportunities involve the students, letting them bond as a community.</p>
<h3>Groups and activities</h3>
<h4>Student organizations</h4>
<p>NMU hosts a large number of student organizations which are governmental, academic, programming, social, religious, and athletic, as well as residence hall related, in nature.
