<p> </p>
<p><strong>John Carroll University</strong> is a private, co-educational <a>Jesuit</a> Catholic university in <a>University Heights, Ohio</a>, a suburb of <a>Cleveland</a>.
The university was founded as <a>Saint Ignatius College</a> by the <a>Society of Jesus</a>.
A member of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>, John Carroll was founded in 1886.</p>
<p>The university is organized into two schools: the College of Arts and Sciences and the Boler School of Business, each defining its own academic programs at the graduate and undergraduate level under the auspices of the Academic Vice President.
Since the mid 20th century, the university has been expanding both its campus resources and influence worldwide.
Several new academic and residence buildings have been constructed and the university has expanded its international programs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:MainBldgFullView.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The main building of St. Ignatius College (renamed John Carroll University in 1923).
While the university relocated in 1935, the historical building on West 30th Street is now part of the [[Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland)|Saint Ignatius High School]] campus.]]
John Carroll University was founded in <a>1886</a> under the title of <strong>St.
Ignatius College</strong> as a &quot;college for men.&quot;
It has been in continuous operation as a degree-granting institution since that time.
Founded as the 19th of 28 <a>Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States</a>, it was founded 97 years after Georgetown University.
</p>
<p>The <a>Jesuits</a> who founded St. Ignatius College were exiles from <a>Germany</a>, forced out by <a>Bismarck's</a> <a>Kulturkampf</a>.
They brought with them the traditional structure of the Jesuit college as an extension of the apostolate of the religious community to prepare the student morally as well as intellectually.
The principal instrument of this education was the classical course of seven years, in which the first three years were devoted to learning languages as necessary tools.
The student was then considered prepared for university work.
The next four years were devoted to the study of classical literature and Latin and Greek prose and poetry, and to developing the ability to express one's self in these languages, as well as in the vernacular, orally and in writing.
The final year was devoted to philosophy.
There were also electives in the sciences, history, and geography, as well as other subjects.
If the student completed only six years, a certificate was given.
Completion of the year of philosophy made the student eligible for the baccalaureate degree, which the college was empowered to grant when it was chartered in 1890.
The first two degrees were awarded in 1895.
</p>
<p>In September 1968, the University made the transition from full-time male enrollment to a fully <a>coeducation</a>al institution, admitting women to the College of Arts and Sciences for the first time.</p>
<p>In recent years, the University has undergone extensive reconstruction and expansion.
In 2003, the University opened the $66 million, 265,000&nbsp;ft&#x00b2; (25,000 m&#x00b2;) Dolan Center for Science and Technology, named after alumnus <a>Charles Dolan</a>, founder of <a>Cablevision</a>, and his wife Helen Dolan.
The couple met while attending John Carroll.</p>
<p>In October 2005, the Rev. Robert Niehoff was inaugurated the 24th president of John Carroll University.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>More than twenty major buildings, predominantly <a>Tudor</a> in architecture, and sixty landscaped acres make up the Carroll campus.
The red-brick Administration Building, surmounted by the university's landmark Grasselli Tower, bears clear resemblance to the English royal palace <a>Hampton Court</a>.</p>
<p>Thorne Acres, a  property in nearby <a>Chardon</a>, provides additional recreational and educational facilities.
</p>
<p>Major buildings include the Grasselli Library and its John G. and Mary Jane Breen Learning Center, the James A. Bohannon Science Center, the Thomas P. O'Malley, SJ Center for Communications and Language Arts, and the D.J. Lombardo Student Center.

Schott Dining Hall, the Inn Between, the Underground, recreational facilities, public conference rooms, and offices for student organizations; it is also the location of the Fritzsche Religious Center containing the campus ministry offices and the Saint Francis Chapel.
In recent years, the University has purchased several homes as well as a nearby shopping plaza which abut the campus in order to both provide for additional office and housing space, but also to help preserve the look of the neighborhood around the campus which has become landlocked since the University was one of the original developments in what was once part of neighboring <a>Shaker Heights</a>.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Core Curriculum</h3>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences requires a rigorous <a>liberal arts</a> core for all undergraduate students.
Among the requirements are a first year seminar course, two semesters of a foreign language, three <a>philosophy</a> courses, and two <a>religious studies</a> courses.</p>
<p>The Core Curriculum in the <a>Liberal Arts</a> of John Carroll is informed by the principles that issue from the University's mission as a Catholic and Jesuit liberal arts institution of higher learning.
Accordingly, the Core emphasizes the development of whole human persons who are educated in the humanizing arts and sciences; skilled in expression and in scholarly investigation; and aware of the interrelationship of all knowledge and the interdependence of all peoples.
Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and culture by imparting a deeper knowledge of and respect for the students' own cultural and religious traditions as well as those of others.
Finally, it highlights intellectual, moral and spiritual principles, and the responsible social actions which flow from them.</p>
<p>As a means to achieve these and other goals significant to the University's mission, the Core has a distributive structure as well as distinctive emphases.
The Core thus allows selectivity while also stipulating certain academic experiences which are important for all students.</p>
<p>The distributive requirements are designed to combine with the specific requirements to provide an equilibrium among disciplines as well as to create a coherence that will enable students to integrate their core experience successfully.</p>
<h3>International programs</h3>
<p>John Carroll has several <a>international programs</a> in which eligible upperclassman are able to participate.
The university operates several of their own programs and cooperates with other Jesuit universities in operating other programs.
John Carroll University's Exchange Programs include the International Student Exchange Program, and programs at <a>Kansai Gaidai University</a>, <a>Nanzan University</a> and <a>Sophia University</a>, all in <a>Japan</a> as well as the <a>Dortmund University of Technology</a>, <a>Germany</a> and <a>University of Hull</a>, <a>England</a>.</p>
<p>John Carroll University's Sponsored Programs are either administered by John Carroll University or by another Jesuit University.
In certain cases, John Carroll University faculty accompany and remain abroad with the students the entire semester.
These programs include the <a>Belfast</a> Institute in Peace Building and Conflict Transformation, the Boler School of Business Semester in <a>London</a>, <a>Italian Studies</a> at <a>Vatican City</a>, the London Liberal Arts Semester as well as Casa de la Solidaridad in <a>El Salvador</a> and The Jesuit Beijing Center.</p>
<p>All international programs, including those for international students who study at John Carroll, are managed by the University's Center for Global Education.</p>
<h3>Scholarships</h3>
<p>The university has four merit scholarships including the Presidential Honors Award, the Presidential Leadership Award, the <a>Arrupe Scholars Award</a>, and the Magis Scholarship.
Department scholarships are offered by individual departments and include the Castellano Scholarship, usually awarded yearly to one or two freshman applicants who will major in the classical languages (Latin and Greek).
This award covers full tuition for four years.</p>

<h3><a>Arrupe</a></h3>
<p>The Arrupe Scholars Program recognizes John Carroll students for their significant commitment to two interrelated values of John Carroll's mission: intellectual inquiry that demands critical thinking, and engaging in social justice and community service that leads to social action.</p>
<p>Fr.
Arrupe grew in his understanding of the world, its struggles for justice and peace, and the way God continued to call people to be involved in this world.
Students in the Arrupe program can find in his life a paradigm for their own growth, to be unafraid to be challenged, to learn from cultures not their own, and to gauge their growth not in terms of how much they possess but in terms of how much they can give.
A commitment to social justice entails the formation of an ethic of social action that embodies Fr.
Arrupe's ideal of &quot;a commitment to promote justice and to enter into solidarity with the voiceless and the powerless.&quot;</p>
<p>The humanism of today's Jesuit University is not one that removes young men or women from life but one that prepares them to take their place in life with conviction that their talents are not talents until they are directed to help other people, until they have become genuinely men and women for others.
</p>
<p>A commitment to social justice is the full, fair and equal participation of all groups in a society that is mutually shaped to meet the needs of each individual member.</p>
<p>Social justice involves individuals with a deep understanding of their own agency, as well as a personal sense of social responsibility toward and with others and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Social justice includes a vision of society in which the distribution of resources is fair and relatively equitable, and all members are physically, spiritually and psychologically safe and secure.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>John Carroll is a primarily residential campus, with over 60% of all students living on campus in eight residence halls; 90% of freshmen and sophomores live on campus.</p>
<h4>Freshman Residences</h4>
<p>During a students first year, they are placed in one of three freshman residence halls:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pacelli Hall</strong>, named after <a>Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII)</a>, is a first year co-ed residence hall and has a capacity of 216.
The second floor of Pacelli is nicknamed &quot;Brocelli&quot; this year due to the fact that is now an all boys floor, and because of the incredible male bonding that takes place on the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Sutowski Hall</strong> has a capacity of 171 students.
Depending on the gender proportions of each freshman class, the hall assignments vary.
For the 2008-2009 Academic Year, Sutowski Hall houses male and female residents.</li>
<li><strong>Murphy Hall</strong> houses 408 freshman students.
Murphy Hall is co-ed, with both male and female residents sharing the same building although not the same wings of the building.
Murphy Hall rooms are designed in a Suite-style layout.

</ul>
<h4>Upperclassman Residences</h4>
<p>The other five residence halls house upperclassmen.
All are coed but rooms are separated by gender in different wings of each hall.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Campion Hall</strong> is the newest of all the residence halls.
It was built in 1990 as &quot;Gnu Hall&quot; but was dedicated to <a>St.

Campion Hall is home to the honors floor with approximately 25 first year students as well as upperclassmen students and also home to three locked sorority suites: Kappa Alpha Theta, Chi Omega, and Gamma Phi Beta.</li>
  <li><strong>Dolan Hall</strong> was completed in 1955 and is dedicated to Thomas F. Dolan.
From 1994 to 2006, Dolan Hall was an all female dormitory but in 2007 it was changed to a co-ed, &quot;Super-Single&quot; style dorm with 214 students living in individual rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Hamlin Hall</strong> was built in 1988 and is dedicated to Richard M. Hamlin, a John Carroll University <a>alumnus</a>.

  <li><strong>Millor Hall</strong> was finished in 1981.
Though it is not known why, this building on the West side of campus was originally named &quot;South Hall&quot; but was later changed as a dedication to Rev. William J. Millor in October of that year.
242 students reside in Millor Hall which is home to the Delta Tau Delta fraternity floor.</li>
<li><strong>Bernet Hall</strong> was the first dormitory erected on campus in 1935.
It was built at the recommendation of a major supporter of the University and its namesake, John J. Bernet, who called for a place to house those &quot;boys from Greater Cleveland who will be forced to go home every night.&quot;
It was remodeled from its original design and is now the home of 100 upperclassmen, each of whom has an apartment style dormitory with either 2, 4 or 6 students per apartment.
Residency in Bernet Hall is competitive and the only residence hall on John Carroll's campus requiring an application.</li>
