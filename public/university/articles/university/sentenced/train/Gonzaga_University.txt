Mock Trial members are usually undergraduate students, majoring in many different areas of subject, who are looking to experience the American Judicial System.
Students in this club are given a case and they &#x201c;mock&#x201d; a political situation, pretending to be attorneys and witnesses.
This club competes with over 600 other universities and institutions nationally and has attended the Grand National Tournament 13 times consecutively.
Currently, the Gonzaga Mock Trial holds the title of Regional Champion and 9th Place National Champion.

<h2>Campus Art</h2>
<p>Gonzaga University is host to many unique historical pieces of artwork.
For example, a wide range of statues located around campus gives visitors and students alike a taste of the Gonzaga culture.
Statues of St. Ignatius, <a>St.
Joseph</a>, <a>Bing Crosby</a> and <a>St.
Aloysius</a> are among the most notable religious landmarks on campus.

<h3>Jundt Fall Exhibit</h3>
<p>Gonzaga University offers the invitational exhibit, &#x201c;Drawn the Wall,&#x201d; every three years in the Jundt Art Museum, located on the university&#x2019;s main campus.
This exhibit features five well-known Inland Northwest artists all of whom present an original work on 11 &#x00bd;-by-8-foot moveable museum wall.
Each artist spends two weeks at the museum, during which time they create an original piece of art according to a common theme.
For example, artists selected to participate in 2010&#x2019;s &#x201c;Drawn to the IV&#x201d; were asked to find workable solutions to large scale drawings and to the constraints of working in a &#x201c;common&#x201d; environment.
In a unique fashion, the drawings present in the exhibit are removed and painted over when the exhibit ends, and the walls upon which the drawings once resided are return to their normal use as gallery partitions.
&#x201d;Drawn to the Wall IV&#x201d; features the distinct talents of Michael Horswill, Louise Kodis, Ken Spiering, Carolyn Stephens, and Gordon Wilson.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  <a>120px|left</a></p>
<p>Gonzaga University, whose official mascot is the Bulldog and whose players are nicknamed the <em>Zags,</em> is part of the <a>NCAA</a> Division I <a>West Coast Conference</a>.
Its <a>men's basketball team</a>, which did not make its first appearance in the <a>NCAA tournament</a> until <a>1995</a> (more than a decade after NBA Hall of Fame player and Gonzaga alum <a>John Stockton</a> graduated), has become nationally prominent since making the regional finals of the NCAA tournament (&quot;Elite Eight&quot;) in <a>1999</a>, re-appearing in the tournament every year since.</p>
<p>Gonzaga University <a>basketball</a> games are held in the <a>McCarthey Athletic Center</a>, in which the men's basketball team has won over 90 percent of its games.
The men's team often plays high-profile non-conference games at the <a>Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena</a> near downtown Spokane, in addition to the annual Comcast Battle in Seattle game held at <a>KeyArena</a> in Seattle.</p>
<p>Two of Gonzaga's most recent notable athletes are basketball players; former <a>center</a> <a>Ronny Turiaf</a> (now playing for the <a>New York Knicks</a>) and third overall <a>2006 NBA Draft</a> pick and Los Angeles Laker <a>Adam Morrison</a> (who was selected by the <a>Charlotte Bobcats</a>), regarded for his likeness to Hall of Famer <a>Larry Bird</a>.
Head coach <a>Mark Few</a> was the <a>West Coast Conference</a> coach of the year from <a>2001</a> to <a>2006</a>, and again in <a>2008</a>.
Few became the <a>head coach</a> in the summer of <a>1999</a>, following the departure of <a>Dan Monson</a> to <a>Minnesota</a>.</p>
<p>Like some other smaller colleges, Gonzaga's <a>football</a> program ended in the Fall of 1941, just before the U.S. entry into <a>World War II</a>, but not before producing two <a>Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>rs: <a>Tony Canadeo</a> '41 of the <a>Green Bay Packers</a>, and <a>Ray Flaherty</a> '26, head coach of the <a>Washington Redskins</a>.
In addition, Flaherty recruited former Bulldog football stars, <a>Ed Justice</a>, <a>George &quot;Automatic&quot; Karamatic</a> and <a>Max Krause</a> to play in the Redskin backfield.
Gonzaga football ended due to declining enrollment of young male athletes.
Efforts to restart the program in 1946 were unsuccessful, and the football stadium was razed in 1949.</p>
<p>Gonzaga University also has an <a>Army ROTC</a> <a>Ranger Challenge</a> team which has won 15 championships in the last 16 years, and is a multiple winner of the Douglas MacArthur Award, given annually to the best Army ROTC program in the Western United States.
