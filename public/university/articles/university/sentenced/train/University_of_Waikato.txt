The <strong>University of Waikato</strong> (informally <strong>Waikato University</strong>, or simply <strong>Waikato</strong>) () is located in <a>Hamilton</a> and <a>Tauranga</a>, <a>New Zealand</a>, and was established in <a>1964</a>.
It has strengths across a broad range of subject areas, particularly its degrees in Computer Science and in Management.
Its School of M&#x0101;ori and Pacific Development is acknowledged as the world centre for study in this subject area.</p>
<p>In 2007, over 12,000 students were enrolled at the University.
More than a quarter of students were aged over 25, and over half were women.
It has the highest proportion of <a>M&#x0101;ori</a> students on any campus in New Zealand.
The M&#x0101;ori character of the campus is an important aspect of its overall identity.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a>QS World University Rankings</a> gave Waikato 316th place, slightly down from its ranking in 2009.</p>
<p>Out of 3,900 business schools in the world, University of Waikato is one of the 48 universities in the world to have <a>Triple accreditation</a>.
In New Zealand, it is one of the two universities to have Triple accreditation and one of the three universities in <a>Australia</a> and New Zealand.
The other universities are the <a>University of Auckland</a> in New Zealand and <a>Brisbane Graduate School of Business</a>, <a>Queensland University of Technology</a>, in Australia.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato in Hamilton is spread over  of landscaped park-like grounds, and includes extensive sporting and recreational areas surrounding three ornamental lakes.
Many sporting and cultural groups are active on campus, including various international students' clubs.
The University provides study facilities including modern lecture rooms and laboratories, a library of over 1,000,000 volumes, and an extensive computer network with over 800 terminals.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato at <a>Tauranga</a> (formerly <em>Tauranga University College</em>) is smaller than the Hamilton campus.
It offers 150 papers predominantly at undergraduate level.</p>
<h2>Academic schools and divisions</h2>
<p>The University consists of seven faculties and school of study:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.</li>
<li><a>Faculty of Law</a></li>
  <li>Waikato Management School.</li>
<li>Faculty of Education.</li>
<li>Faculty of Science and Engineering.</li>
<li>Faculty of Computing and Mathematical Science.</li>
<li>School of M&#x0101;ori and Pacific Development</li>
</ul>
<p>These faculties and school of study offer undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees in their respective subject areas.</p>
<p><a>Waikato Pathways College</a> specialises in preparing students, and in particular international students, for further study at Waikato.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The University's research involvement is varied, and it is noted for research in the management disciplines of Accounting, Finance and Human Resource Management; Computer Science, Mathematics, Science, particularly in the Biological Sciences including both Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour and Cellular, Molecular and Whole Organism Biology, and Chemistry, Education and the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>The University has many research facilities, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Centre for Biodiversity and Ecology Research</li>
  <li>Stable Isotope Unit</li>
  <li>Management Research Centre</li>
  <li>Technology Management and Innovation Unit</li>
  <li>Centre for Labour and Trade Union Studies</li>
  <li>Carbon Dating Unit</li>
  <li>Honey Research Unit</li>
  <li>Thermophile Research Unit</li>
  <li>Antarctic Research Unit</li>
  <li>International Global Change Institute</li>
  <li>Mediarena Centre for Research</li>
</ul>
<p>Research is further reinforced by close contact between the University and commercial or governmental research facilities located on or adjacent to the campus.
Significant among them are the <a>Ruakura</a> Research Centre (the largest agricultural and horticultural research facility in the <a>southern hemisphere</a>), <a>Landcare Research</a>, <a>National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research</a> (NIWA Ecosystems), and the Institute of Professional Legal Studies.</p>
<p>Cementing the University's role as a key New Zealand research institute is <a>UNILink</a>, the University's own consulting division, dedicated to national and international sourcing of commercial research contracts.
As a result the University attracts the highest percentage of research income in proportion to its student population of any university in New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Particular strengths</h2>
<p>The Mathematics department was rated first in New Zealand on the <a>PBRF</a> rankings in both 2004 and 2007.</p>
<p>The Department of Biological Sciences earned first place rankings in both panels of <a>PBRF</a>: Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour and Cellular, Molecular and Whole Organism Biology.
Within EEB, the department has long-term <a>FRST</a> funding in the areas of <strong>restoration ecology</strong> in both terrestrial and freshwater systems, reaching from urban to natural ecosystems, and from molecular ecology to environmental biology.</p>
<p>The School of M&#x0101;ori and Pacific Development is almost certainly the leading centre of academic study of things M&#x0101;ori; <a>Russell Bishop</a> is the Chair Professor.
Similarly, the law school is a leading centre for research into the <a>Treaty of Waitangi</a>.
Because of the relative youth of the University, the library's holdings are relatively undeveloped, but there are significantly holdings of <a>Tainui</a> taonga.</p>
<p>The Computer Science department is particularly strong, with research groups in <a>networking</a>, <a>machine learning</a> (<a>Weka</a>), <a>digital libraries</a> (<a>Greenstone</a>), <a>Formal methods for Software Engineering</a> and <a>usability</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Law was founded in 1990 and follows the principles of professionalism, biculturalism and the study of law in context.
The School of Law focuses on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as opposed to a more adversarial approach.
As well as offering graduates their Bachelor of Laws (LLB), if students elect to take Commercial Transactions as well as Mediation: Laws, Principles and Practice, they may also apply for Associate status with the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand (AMINZ).
This gives them professional status when conducting these activities and is globally recognised.</p>
<p>The University is co-located with <a>Ruakura</a>, a centre for research in the primary industries.</p>
<p>Due to the proximity of the <a>Waikato River</a> and <a>Lake Karapiro</a> the University has excellent rowing teams and competes against <a>University of Oxford</a> and <a>University of Cambridge</a> in alternating years on the <a>Waikato River</a> in <a>The Great Race</a>.</p>

There are also a growing number of students from diverse places such as <a>Nepal</a>, <a>Eritrea</a>, <a>Mongolia</a>, <a>Ukraine</a>, and various <a>Africa</a>n countries.
Many international students start at the University of Waikato by enrolling in a one-year Certificate of Attainment in Foundation Studies.
This prepares students from a non-English background for university study in New Zealand.
Courses in English for students from non-English speaking backgrounds are also offered through the University of Waikato Language Institute.</p>
<p>The University has approximately 1,000 places in accommodation available for students, a number of which are set aside specifically for international students.
Many students choose to stay in the University Halls of Residence during their first year, and then move into a student flat (private rental accommodation) in subsequent years.
<a>Hamilton</a> is an inexpensive city to live in for students on a limited budget.</p>
<h2>Post Graduate Student Association</h2>
<p>The Waikato Post Graduate Student Association was a development that come about as a need in the performance Based Research Funding (PBRF) environment.
The group of students looked after the Masters and PhD students interest and had Dr Peter Hodder as a contact person appointed by Professor Richard Bedford at the time Pro Vice Chancellor Academic.
PGSA organizes a number of activities.</p>
<h2>Student Centre development</h2>
<p>In November 2008, work began on one of the largest construction projects in the University's lifetime, this involved the upgrade and total rebuilding of the main library at the Hamilton campus.</p>
<p>The library which will transform into the &quot;Student Centre&quot; (yet to be officially named) is costing an estimated $33.4 million and is expected to take around four years to complete.
The student centre will be the first library in <a>Australasia</a> to fully generate its own power, earning it a 5 star green building award.</p>
<p>Once finished, the Student Centre will include six levels, two new cafes, a new bookshop, and various other amenities.
The Law Library will be situated on the 5th floor.</p>
<p>The Student Center and recent rebuilding of the Village Green (formerly the university shops) have been two developments which reflect the University's aim to provide the most modern facilities possible.</p>
<h2>University restructuring</h2>
<p>In August 2009, the University magazine <em>Nexus</em> gained information that the University was preparing to restructure its faculty and schools of study in response to a high increase in student numbers.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring will create four new faculties of study:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences</li>
  <li>Faculty of Law and Management</li>
  <li>Faculty of Human Development and Education</li>
  <li>Faculty of Natural Sciences and Engineering</li>
