<p>  <strong>Kettering University</strong> (formerly &quot;General Motors Institute&quot;) is a university in <a>Flint, Michigan</a>, offering degrees in <a>engineering</a>, math, science, and business.
The campus is located along the <a>Flint River</a> on property that used to be the main manufacturing location for <a>General Motors</a>.
It is named after inventor and former head of research for General Motors <a>Charles Kettering</a>.</p>
<p>Ninety-eight percent of seniors are employed or accepted to graduate schools before graduation.
One out of 15 alumni either own their own business or are high-level managers in leading companies (see <a>Notable Alumni</a>).
Although the school's undergraduate population is small with approximately total 2,000 students, it annually graduates the most mechanical engineers and is ranked by <a>US News and World Report</a> as one of the best schools without doctoral programs for undergraduate engineering education.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of Kettering University is deeply tied to the development of the American <a>automotive industry</a>.
The school was originally founded as The School of Automobile Trades on October 20, 1919 by Albert Sobey under the direction of the Industrial Fellowship of Flint as a night school, training individuals for careers in industry.
In 1923 the school became known as the Flint <a>Institute of Technology</a>.
<a>General Motors</a> acquired the school on July 12, 1926, renaming it General Motors Institute of Technology.
In 1932 the name of the school was shortened to General Motors Institute.</p>
<p>GMI focused on creating leaders for business and industry (sometimes called the West Point of Industry) and pioneered many educational firsts including the co-op program (following the development of this program at the <a>University of Cincinnati</a> in 1907), freshmen level manufacturing courses (Production Processes I &amp; II), and automotive degree specialties.
A fifth-year thesis requirement was added in 1945, along with the ability to grant degrees.
The first bachelor's degree was awarded on August 23, 1946.</p>
<p>The co-op program required applicants to find a GM division to be their sponsor.
Work and school were mixed in six-week rotations, dividing the student body into <a>A-section</a> and  <a>B-section</a>.
At any given time, when A-section was in school, B-section was at work.
After six weeks, B-section would go back to school and so on.
This resulted in students moving eight times per year and a 48-week school/work year.
Because General Motors used the school to train its engineers, tuition was partially subsidized.</p>
<p>In June 1980 (the Class of 1985) co-op rotations were expanded to twelve weeks.
After GM reduced operations in Flint, the company and the University separated on July 1, 1982, although GM continued to hire co-ops from GMI.
The name of the institution became &quot;GMI Engineering &amp; Management Institute&quot; although the  letters &quot;GMI&quot; were retained to allow easy identification with the old General Motors Institute.
New co-op employers began participating, including <a>Magna International</a> of Canada, and the University began charging full tuition.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1998 the school's name was formally changed to Kettering University in order to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>create an identity separate from General Motors and the auto industry, </li>
  <li>avoid confusion with General Motors University, a General Motors training center created in 1997.</li>
<li>honor <a>Charles F. Kettering</a>, an early 20th century inventor, a proponent of cooperative education, and an early benefactor of the school.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p> The 2006 freshman class of 398 students was selected from 2,157 applicants with 1,534 admitted.
86% of freshmen scored 600 or above on the math section of the <a>SAT</a> and 84% scored over 500 on the verbal section.
Students averaged a 3.54 high school <a>GPA</a> and an average <a>ACT</a> score of 26.
Approximately 83.4% of the degree-seeking undergraduate student body is male.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>Kettering University offers <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees in <a>Applied Mathematics</a>, <a>Applied Physics</a>, <a>Biochemistry</a>, Business, <a>Chemical Engineering</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Computer Engineering</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, <a>Engineering Physics</a>, <a>Industrial Engineering</a>, and <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>.
The university also offers a Bachelors of Business Administration..
The University also offers <a>Master's</a> degrees in     Business Administration (MBA), Information Technology, Manufacturing Management, Operations Management, Manufacturing Operations, Engineering Management, and Engineering .
Although courses differ with major, for most undergraduate programs, completion of 160 credit hours is needed for graduation.</p>
<p>Kettering is one of the few engineering schools that prepares students for the workplace through 100% participation in a <a>co-op</a> program.
In addition to classwork, students spend half the year acquiring full-time professional work experience.
This is broken into four rotations of 11 week terms.
The student body is separated into two sections, A and B. A-Section attends classes from July to September and then from January to March, while B-Section attends classes from October to December and April to June.
During the three-month periods between class terms, students work full-time with one of over 600 co-op employer partners.
As a requirement to graduate, each student must complete five work terms and a major project for their employer in the form of a thesis.
On average a student earns between $40,000 and $65,000 throughout their co-op experience.
The curriculum is designed to be completed in four and one-half years, although it is possible to complete it in four years.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|C.S. Mott Engineering and Science Center</a> <a>thumb|left|Frances Willson Thompson Hall</a>Kettering University consists of six buildings and nearly  of land.
In 1995, Kettering built a park spanning over much of this land.
In addition to this, the Connie and Jim John Recreation Center opened on August 5, 1995; it offers students a larger selection of activities.
With over , some of the more notable aspects are its Olympic sized pool, indoor track and numerous tennis, basketball and racquetball courts.</p>
<p>Kettering offers two of these six buildings for student housing.
The school's Campus Center is the location of the Admissions and Public Relations offices as well as the student cafeteria.</p>
<p>The C.S. Mott Engineering and Science Center opened in July 2004 and contains an entire <a>fuel cell</a> systems and <a>powertrain</a> integration labs.
This $43 million dollar facility also contains several other laboratories such as <a>emissions</a>, <a>bioengineering</a> and various others for the core science courses for most students.</p>
<p>Kettering is also one of the few schools in the nation to have a crash safety center, in which students are able to experience <a>crash test</a>ing and develop effective safety equipment.
Also located in the Academic Building, Kettering offers a variety of other engineering labs such as machining, welding, polymer processing and injection molding.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Forty eight percent of students live in either the 445-student residence hall or Campus Village Apartment complex adjacent to campus, capable of housing 211.
Others live in Greek housing facilities or private rental properties near campus.
Kettering students stay involved in over 15 Greek organizations, student government and recreational activities.</p>
<h3>Clubs</h3>
<p><a>Kettering Student Government</a> sponsors many student clubs to promote an atmosphere conducive to social interaction.
Most clubs receive money from the University to operate.
However, some clubs are self financing, either because they wish to avoid the restrictions placed on the Kettering Student Government (KSG) sponsored clubs or because they are unaware that funding is available.
For a full list of clubs, see the <a>list of student organizations</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h3>Kettnetic Thunder Ultimate Frisbee Team</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|100px|Kettnetic Thunder Logo</a> Kettering University began forming its <a>Ultimate Frisbee</a> Team in the fall of 2009.
Ken Kaminski, an incoming freshman, contacted the Kettering &quot;Frisbee Club&quot; president, Adam Koehler.
Koehler and Kaminski  made plans to develop a roster and start competing against other Michigan teams.
Koehler and Kaminski were diligent while developing the program.
After becoming a <a>USA Ultimate</a> registered team, the two created a name, Kettnetic Thunder; logo; uniform; and a team website in just under six months.
The group competed in the 2010 USAU Series, where many teams were impressed with the team's rapid progression.
After the B-Section team was firmly planted, Kaminski contacted A-Section students in order to make a similar program available in the summer of 2010.
Zach Johnson and Ben VanZoest, A-Section's Ultimate Frisbee team captains, were chosen to help develop their section's Ultimate Club.
</p>
<p>Within one year of its origin the club has grown at a rapid rate and plans have been made to make Kettnetic Thunder a continuing success as well as a boon to the university for years to come.
Kettering's  student leaders have created one of the most highly structured Ultimate Frisbee teams in the state of Michigan in less than a year.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>The university has a very active Greek system, which is recognized as an excellent source of service opportunities and leadership training.
Over one-third of the student body is currently involved in a <a>Fraternity or sorority</a>.
Before on campus housing was available, membership was as high as 80%.</p>
<p>Many <a>North-American Interfraternity Conference</a> (NIC) fraternities have chapters at Kettering as do several <a>National Panhellenic Conference</a> (NPC) <a>sororities</a>.
The <a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a> (NPHC) has several local chapters that are also affiliated with Kettering.
Each group has a school-wide council that its members participate in.
These councils are designed to keep communication lines open between the different groups, and to facilitate relations with the University on matters such as school-wide events and membership.
In addition to the recognized organizations there are several unrecognized organizations including a local <a>Christian</a> fraternity and a local Christian sorority.
For a full list of the Greek letter organizations on campus, see the <a>list of Greek Letter Organizations</a>.</p>
<p>During the first few weeks of school, freshmen are &quot;rushed&quot;, a period of recruitment where all of the IFC Fraternities host events and attempt to recruit new members.
Fraternities promote their events with signs, calendars, personal visits, and by painting the bull dog, a campus tradition.</p>
