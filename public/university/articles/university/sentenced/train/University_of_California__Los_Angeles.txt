<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:UCLA-old-statenormal-campus.jpg|thumb|left|The
Los Angeles branch of [[California State Normal School]], in 1881.]]
<a>thumb|left|University of California, Southern Branch's Vermont Campus, 1922.</a></p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>In March 1881, after heavy lobbying by Los Angeles residents, the <a>California State Legislature</a> authorized the creation of a southern branch of the <a>California State Normal School</a> (which later became <a>San Jose State University</a>) in <a>downtown Los Angeles</a> to train teachers for the growing population of <a>Southern California</a>.
The State <a>Normal School</a> at Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the <a>Los Angeles Public Library</a> system.
The new facility included an <a>elementary school</a> where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children.
That elementary school is related to the present day version, UCLA Lab School.
In 1887, the school became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School.</p>
<p>In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on <a>Vermont Avenue</a> (now the site of <a>Los Angeles City College</a>) in <a>Hollywood</a>.
In 1917, UC Regent Edward A. Dickson, the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore, Director of the Normal School, began working together to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second <a>University of California</a> campus, after <a>Berkeley</a>.
They met resistance from Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus.
David Prescott Barrows, the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections.
On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor <a>William D. Stephens</a> signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which turned the campus into the <a>Southern Branch of the University of California</a> and added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science.
The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction.</p>
<p>Under University of California President <a>William Wallace Campbell</a>, enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25&nbsp;<a>acre</a> Vermont Avenue location.
The Regents conducted a search for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called &quot;Beverly Site&quot;&mdash;just west of <a>Beverly Hills</a>&mdash;on March 21, 1925.
After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname &quot;Bruins,&quot; a name offered by the student council at Berkeley.
In 1927, the Regents renamed the campus the &quot;University of California at Los Angeles&quot; (the word &quot;at&quot; was officially replaced by a <a>comma</a> in 1958, in line with other UC campuses) and the state broke ground in <a>Westwood</a> on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers <a>Edwin and Harold Janss</a>, for whom the Janss Steps are named.

<h3>Maturity as a university</h3>
<p>The campus received its first chancellor in 1951, thereby establishing itself as an autonomous entity within the UC system.
The appointment of <a>Franklin David Murphy</a> to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped to spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors.
By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects.
This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university in her own right and not simply a branch of the UC system.
This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him later on:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, 'University of California.'
And I said, 'Is this Berkeley?'
She said, 'No.'
I said, 'Well, who have I gotten to?' 'UCLA.'
I said, 'Why didn't you say UCLA?' 'Oh,' she said, 'we're instructed to say University of California.'
So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, 'Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, &quot;UCLA.&quot;'
And they said, 'You know they won't like it at Berkeley.'
And I said, 'Well, let's just see.
There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission.'&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2006, the university completed Campaign UCLA, which collected over <a>$</a>3.05
billion and is the second most successful fundraising campaign.
In 2008, UCLA raised over $456 million, ranking the institution among the top 10 universities in the United States in total fundraising for the year.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Aerial photo of UCLA campus</a> When UCLA opened its new campus in 1919, it had four buildings.
Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419&nbsp;acres (1.7&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) in the western part of <a>Los Angeles</a>, north of the <a>Westwood</a> shopping district and just south of <a>Sunset Boulevard</a>.
The campus is close but not adjacent to the <a>San Diego Freeway</a>.</p>
<p>The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.
It is located in the residential area of <a>Westwood</a> and bordered by <a>Bel-Air</a>, <a>Beverly Hills</a>, and <a>Brentwood</a>.
The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land.
North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more old-fashioned in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick.
North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, and business programs and is centered around oak tree-lined Dickson Court.
South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, psychology, mathematical sciences, all health-related fields, and the <a>UCLA Medical Center</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Janss Steps</a></p>
<p>Ackerman Union, the <a>John Wooden</a> Center, the <a>Arthur Ashe</a> Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and <a>Pauley Pavilion</a> stand at the center of the campus.
<a>Bruin Walk</a>, a heavily traveled pathway from housing to the main campus, bisects the campus.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The first campus buildings were designed by the local firm Allison &amp; Allison.
The <a>Romanesque Revival</a> style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style on campus until the 1950s, when architect <a>Welton Becket</a> was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades.
Becket greatly streamlined the  general appearance of the campus, adding several rows of <a>minimalist</a>, slab&ndash;shaped brick buildings to the southern half of the campus, the largest of these being the <a>UCLA Medical Center</a>.
Architects such as <a>A.
Quincy Jones</a>, <a>William Pereira</a> and <a>Paul Williams</a> designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century.
More  recent additions include buildings designed by architects <a>I.M. Pei</a>, <a>Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates</a>, <a>Richard Meier</a>, <a>Cesar Pelli</a>, and <a>Rafael Vinoly</a>.
In order to accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes.
This continuous construction gives UCLA the on-campus nickname of &quot;Under Construction Like Always.&quot;</p>
<p>[[Image:RHall.JPG|thumb|left|[[Royce Hall]], one of the original four buildings of the campus, has become the symbol of UCLA, taking inspiration from <a>Italian</a> <a>Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio</a>, in <a>Milan</a>]]</p>
<p>The tallest building on campus is named after <a>Ralph Bunche</a>, an African-American alumnus, who received the 1950 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Palestine.
A bust of him, on the entrance to Bunche Hall, overlooks the <a>Franklin D. Murphy</a> Sculpture Garden.
He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.</p>
<p>A mile from campus, the UCLA Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located in the community of <a>Bel-Air</a>.
The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959.
After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>With a location near <a>Hollywood</a> and a world-famous film and television school, the UCLA campus has attracted filming for decades.
Much of the 1985 film <em><a>Gotcha!</a></em> was shot at UCLA, as well as <a>John Singleton</a>'s <em><a>Higher Learning</a></em> (1995).
<em><a>Legally Blonde</a></em>, &quot;Old School&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, <em><a>Erin Brockovich</a></em>, &quot;How High&quot; (2001), and <em><a>American Pie 2</a></em> all were mainly shot at the university campus or locale.
In January 2009, the <a>Bollywood</a> movie <a>My Name is Khan</a> was shot at UCLA.
Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in <a>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> were also filmed at UCLA.
In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA instated a policy on filming and professional photography at the campus.
&quot;UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry,&quot; said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz.
&quot;So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on.
We're right where the action is.&quot;</p>
<h3>Transportation &amp; Parking</h3>
<p>The campus maintains 24,000 <a>parking</a> spaces and operates an award-winning sustainable transportation program,.
Elements of the sustainable transportation program include vanpools, a campus shuttle system called <a>BruinBus</a>, discounted carpool permits, and subsidized transit passes.
One of the pass programs includes BruinGO, which allows students and staff members to purchase discounted one-way or quarterly passes to ride <a>Santa Monica</a>'s <a>Big Blue Bus</a> and Culver City's <a>Culver CityBus</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>UCLA Healthcare</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|UCLA Medical Plaza is near the main entrance to the campus</a> The <a>David Geffen School of Medicine</a>, along with the <a>School of Nursing</a>, <a>School of Dentistry</a>, and <a>School of Public Health</a>, comprise the professional schools of health science.
In 2005, UCLA announced its five-year plan to establish the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine; the state of California is rare in its public funding of research with new embryonic <a>stem cell</a> lines.
The <a>California NanoSystems Institute</a> is another project that was created out of a partnership with the <a>University of California, Santa Barbara</a> to pioneer innovations in the field of <a>nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</a> is a part of a larger healthcare system, UCLA Healthcare, which also operates a hospital in <a>Santa Monica</a> and seven primary care clinics throughout <a>Los Angeles County</a>.
In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two <a>Los Angeles County</a> public hospitals as teaching hospitals&#x2014;<a>Harbor-UCLA Medical Center</a> and <a>Olive View-UCLA Medical Center</a>&#x2014;as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the West Coast, <a>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a>.
In 1981, the UCLA Medical Center made history when an assistant professor named Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed an unknown affliction later to be called <a>AIDS</a>.
UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of PET scanning to study brain function.
The signaling cascade of <a>nitric oxide</a>, one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology was discovered in part by the medical school's Professor of Pharmacology Louis J. Ignarro.
For this, he was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology along with two other researchers - Robert F. Furchgott of the SUNY Health Science Center and Ferid Murad of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.</p>
<p>In the 2007 edition of <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>, UCLA Medical Center was ranked best in the West, as well as one of the top 3 hospitals in the <a>United States</a> alongside <a>Mayo Clinic</a>, <a>Cleveland Clinic</a>, <a>Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, and <a>Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>.
In 15 of the 16 medical specialty areas examined, UCLA Medical Center ranked in the top 20.</p>

<h3>Library system</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Powell Library, located across the quad from Royce Hall.</a>
UCLA's library system has over eight million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers.
It is the nation's 14th largest library in number of volumes.</p>
<p>The first library, University library (presently Powell), was founded in 1884.
In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian.
<a>Lawrence Powell</a> became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, he was named Dean of the School of Library Service.
More libraries were added as previous ones filled.
Page Ackerman became University Librarian in 1973, and was the nation's first female librarian of a system as large as UCLA's.
She oversaw the first coordinations between other UC schools, and formed a new administrative network that is still in use today.
Since her retirement, the system has seen steady growth and improvement under various Librarians.
The present University Librarian is Gary E. Strong, who has been in office since September 1, 2003.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt;<strong>Fall freshman statistics</strong>&lt;/big&gt;  &lt;small&gt;<em>This table does not account deferred&lt;br /&gt;applications or other unique situations.</em>&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>UCLA is rated &quot;Most Selective&quot;, by the <a>Princeton Review</a>, with an admissions selectivity rating of 98 (on a scale of 60&#x2013;99).
UCLA received 55,397 applications for the Fall 2008 freshman class, retaining its position as the university with the most freshmen applicants, a title it has held since 1998.
For the 2008-09 year, 12,579 applicants were admitted, 22.7% of the total.
Out of the 4,700 students in the Fall 2006 class, 96 were African American, and 20 of those were recruited athletes.
This is the lowest number of African Americans to enter into a class at UCLA in more than 30 years, and it  comes at a time when the other schools in the UC system are seeing an increase.
In response to this issue, UCLA decided to shift to a more holistic admissions process, similar to that of UC Berkeley, starting Fall 2007.
Preliminary data show that the overall number of underrepresented student applicants at UCLA &#x2014; Native Americans, African Americans, and Chicanos/Latinos &#x2014; increased from 10,097 in fall 2006 (22.2% of 2006 applicants) to 11,414 for fall 2007 (23.6%).
<a>thumb|Mattel Children's Hospital at the Ronald Reagan Medical Center</a></p>
<h3>Graduate</h3>
<p>In Fall 2005, the <a>David Geffen School of Medicine</a> admitted 4.5% of its applicants, the <a>School of Law</a> admitted 16.1%, and the <a>Anderson School of Management</a> admitted 30.6%.</p>
<p>According to the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Guide to Dental Schools, 44th Ed., the <a>UCLA School of Dentistry</a> had more than 1,465 applicants for 88 seats in the entering class of 2006.
The average <a>Dental Admissions Test</a> (DAT) scores for admitted students in the entering class of 2007 were 22 on the academic portion (3rd highest average in the nation after Harvard and Columbia) and 20 on the perceptual aptitude portion of the exam (3rd highest average after Harvard and University of Washington).</p>
<h2>Economic impact</h2>
<p>[[Image:UCLA hoodie.jpg|thumb|right|A
[[hoodie]] from the UCLA store]] The University has a significant impact in the Los Angeles Economy.
It is the fourth largest employer in the county, after Los Angeles County, LAUSD and the Federal Government, and the seventh largest in the region.
In 2005-2006, the university had an operating budget of $3.6 billion, of which 17.4% was from California state government appropriations.</p>
<h3>Trademarks and licensing</h3>
<p>The UCLA trademark also sells as an overseas clothing and accessories brand.
This trend arises from the school's athletic and academic reputation, and popular images of the <a>Southern California</a> lifestyle.
High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout East Asia.
Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in <a>South Korea</a>, and 43 are currently open in <a>China</a>.
There are also stores in <a>Mexico</a>, <a>Singapore</a>, and <a>Europe</a>.
UCLA makes $400,000 in royalties every year through its international licensing program.
Women's Softball won the 106th National Championship, on June 8, 2010.
Among these championships, some of the more notable victories are in <a>men's basketball</a>.</p>
<p>Under legendary coach <a>John Wooden</a>, UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a <a>record seven consecutive</a>, in 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is <a>two</a>).</p>
<p>The schools share a rivalry in many other sports.
In volleyball, UCLA won 19 <a>NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship</a>s against USC's four.
In women's volleyball UCLA leads the all-time series against USC as well.
In the popular sport of soccer UCLA leads USC in the all-time series 13-3-0.
USC has 18 <a>NCAA Men's Tennis Championship</a>s, while UCLA only has 16.
The <a>Lexus Gauntlet</a> is the name given to the official competition between the two schools in 18 varsity sports.
This rivalry even extends to the <a>Olympic Games</a>, where UCLA athletes have won 213 medals and USC athletes have won 234.</p>
<p>The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football <a>Hall of Fame coach</a> Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s.
USC, long before established as the reigning power, diverted its attention from then-rival <a>University of Notre Dame</a>, and the rivalry began.</p>
<p>Presently, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, and <a>USC</a> have the most NCAA championships; UCLA holds the most, winning a combined 106 team championships in men's and women's sports, with Stanford coming in second with 95, followed by USC with 91.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:View of West Los Angeles to Downtown from Getty Center.jpg|thumb|View of [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|West Los Angeles]] from the <a>Getty Center</a>.
<a>Westwood</a> and UCLA are in the middle ground.]]
Students have access to a variety of activities when not attending class.
The campus' location in <a>Los Angeles</a> makes excursions to local museums, theaters, or other entertainment venues relatively quick and easy.
UCLA offers classical <a>orchestra</a>s, <a>intramural sports</a>, and over 800 student organizations.
UCLA is also home to more than 60 national and local Greek-letter organizations, which collectively constitute the largest membership-based and multi-faceted community on campus.
Fraternity and sorority members represent 13% of the student population.
The student government at UCLA is the Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA), governed by a student majority board of directors.
It is the umbrella organization that includes the two branches of UCLA's student government, the Graduate Students Association (GSA) and the Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC), the UCLA Store, the Student Union, Restaurants, Trademark &amp; Licensing, and Student Media (including the <em>UCLA Daily Bruin</em>).
The Student Alumni Association (SAA), a branch under the UCLA Alumni Association but entirely student run, is responsible for maintaining and putting on UCLA's oldest and greatest traditions, such as Blue and Gold Week, Senior Send-off, <a>Spring Sing</a>, and Dinners for 12 Strangers amongst many.
UCLA also operates a waterfront facility known as the <a>UCLA Marina Aquatic Center</a> in <a>Marina del Rey</a>.
Students and staff participate in dingy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking.</p>
<p>The UCLA community was shocked in 2009 when a student was stabbed multiple times, including in the neck, during a chemistry lab class.
Lab classes were canceled the next day and counselors were available for students.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>The university has many traditions and annual events involving students, community, or the city.
The school hosts events that usually require participation from more than just the student body, and competitions can occasionally involve celebrity judges and performers.</p>
<p>Unicamp, founded in 1934, is UCLA's official charity.
It is a week-long summer camp for underserved children from the <a>greater Los Angeles area</a>, with UCLA volunteer counselors.
Because Unicamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.</p>
<p>To introduce new students to clubs and activities, UCLA begins the fall quarter with Welcome Week activities (renamed True Bruin Welcome in 2009).
The week includes the newly-added Day of Service for all first-years, the Enormous Activities Fair, the Sports Fair, and other events.
At the end of move-in and the beginning of Welcome Week, UCLA holds BruinBash.
The BruinBash includes a concert, movie, and entertainment.
Past performers include <a>Thrice</a> and <a>Common</a> in 2005, <a>Xzibit</a> and <a>Rooney</a> in 2006, <a>T.I.</a> in 2007, The Cool Kids, Estelle, HelloGoodbye in 2008, LMFAO in 2009, Ying Yang Twins, Travie McCoy and the Cataracs in 2010.
BruinBash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities, in North Westwood Village, where the majority of off-campus students reside adjacent to campus.</p>
<p>Dance Marathon is an annual event put on by the student group, the Pediatric AIDS Coalition, held in Ackerman Grand Ballroom at UCLA, where thousands of students raise money and dance to support the <a>Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation</a>, Project Kindle, and One Heartland.
Dancers are required to fundraise a minimum amount of $208 before the event, which is a 26 hour <a>dance marathon</a>.
Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon.
In 2010, Dance Marathon of UCLA raised a record-breaking $407,000.
Since 2002, the Marathon has raised over $2,100,000.</p>
<p>UCLA students also participate in &quot;Midnight Yell&quot; during finals week, a tradition where every night at midnight (starting on Sunday of finals week), students go outside and yell as loudly as possible for one minute, giving everyone a chance to take a short break from studying and release some nervous energy.
Students who live in on-campus housing are not allowed to participate.</p>

Theater, [[Westwood Village]]]] The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes.
The run first began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as &quot;really short shorts&quot; walked around singing a song and playing a guitar to protest the Police restrictions on the Midnight Yell.
With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee, in order to satisfy concerns but keep the event, changed the route.
It was changed to a run through campus to the fountain in front of Powell Library.
Now it ends with students cavorting in the fountains outside Powell Library.
As attendance increased, committees in charge of organizing the event deemed it necessary to employ the <a>UC Police</a> during the event, to ward off vandalism and dangerous activity.
(The Undie Run concept has since spread to other college campuses around the United States, including the <a>University of Texas at Austin</a> and <a>Syracuse University</a>.)</p>

The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination.
An example of this is the 60-year old <a>Spring Sing</a>, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA).
Spring Sing is UCLA's oldest tradition&#x2014;it is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on campus.
In 2009 the event was held in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry.
Past recipients have included <a>Stevie Wonder</a>, <a>Frank Sinatra</a>, <a>Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a>James Taylor</a>, <a>Ray Charles</a>, <a>Natalie Cole</a>, <a>Quincy Jones</a>, <a>Lionel Richie</a>, and in 2009, <a>Julie Andrews</a>.
The Dinner for 12 Strangers, a common tradition among universities, is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests.
The week before the USC rivalry football game, there is a &quot;Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally.&quot;
The bonfire did not take place in 2006 due to fire hazard issues.
Nonetheless, UCLA won the football game, upsetting the #2 ranked Trojans.
This led many to believe that dispelling of the tradition led to the victory.</p>
<p>Various student groups organize schoolwide fundraisers such as the Jazz Reggae Festival, a two-day concert on <a>Memorial Day</a> weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p></em>[[Image:Kerk.jpg|thumb|Kerckhoff Hall houses the offices of student government and the <em>[[Daily Bruin]]<em>.]]</em>
The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) is the official entity encompassing student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA.
ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and services &amp; enterprises.
However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA is often more narrowly used to refer to the services and enterprises component.
This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc.
These commercial enterprises serving the UCLA campus community generate approximately $90,000,000 in annual revenues, making it financially the largest student government operation in the world.
As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is not to maximize return or &quot;profit&quot; but to provide quality services and programs to the campus community at reasonable prices.
ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors.
The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternate.
The respected presidents of USA and GSA usually serve as chair and vice chair of the board, alternating in the middle of the year.
In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association.
The &quot;services and enterprises&quot; portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 professional career staff and 2,000 student employees.
The board meets monthly and is responsible for setting the priority goals for the year, providing direction to the executive director, and evaluating his or her annual performance.</p>
<p>The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 11,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.</p>
<p>&quot;USAC&quot; is an acronym for Undergraduate Students Association Council, the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.
The student body currently has two major political slates, Bruins United and Students First!.</p>
<p>USAC's thirteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter.
In addition to its thirteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC.
All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the thirteen elected student members have a vote.</p>
<p>The USAC President appoints more than seventy undergraduates to administrative committees and the Academic Affairs Commissioner Appoints approximately 25 undergraduates to Academic Senate Committees.
Students have an opportunity to serve on the ASUCLA Board of Directors and the Communications Board, as well as on other significant committees.
Through their participation on these campus-wide committees, UCLA undergraduates have had input into the decision making process at a high level.</p>
<p>USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities and provide an opportunity for students to participate in.
For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission, including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers.
Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission.
A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness, Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR/First Aid Training.</p>
<p>Student Media UCLA is the home of UCLA's student-run media, including the campus newspaper, magazines, and radio and television stations.</p>
<h3>Media publications</h3>
<p>Most student media publications distributed on-campus are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board.
The <em><a>Daily Bruin</a></em> is UCLA's most prominent student publication.
Founded in 1919 under the name <em>Cub Californian</em>, it has since then developed into <a>Los Angeles</a>' third-most circulated newspaper.
It has won over 20 national awards in the last five years, and is regularly commended for layout and content.
In 2006, the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> awarded it Best All-Around Daily Newspaper in the national Mark of Excellence Awards.
The newspaper has not been without scrutiny and controversy, and in 1954, the administration attempted to intervene with the previous policy of electing editors by a student council.
UCLA Student Media also publishes seven news magazines, each established to serve a special-interest community on campus: <em>Al-Talib</em>, <em>Fem</em>, <em>Ha'Am</em>, <em><a>La Gente de Aztlan</a></em>, <em>Nommo</em>, <em>Pacific Ties</em>, and <em><a>Outwrite</a></em>, a school yearbook, <a>BruinLife</a>, Daily Bruin Television (DBTV), and the student-run radio station, <a>UCLAradio.com</a>,
formerly known as KLA.
Student groups such as <a>The Forum for Energy Economics and Development</a> also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|Rieber Terrace, a housing facility on campus</a> UCLA provides housing to over 10,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students.</p>
<p>Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as &quot;The Hill.&quot;
Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy.
Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> as some of the best in the nation.
Dining halls are located in De Neve, Rieber, Covel, and Hedrick Halls.
Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, and Cafe 1919.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The Student Housing Master Plan, released October 2007, outlines goals to improve and expand student housing, including renovating older residential halls and allowing four years of guaranteed housing to all entering freshmen by 2010.
According to the <em><a>Daily Bruin</a></em>, 1,525 beds, 10 faculty in-residence apartments and a 750-seat dining hall will be built on the Northwest Housing Infill Project on the Hill by 2013.
The buildings are tentatively titled De Neve Gardenia Way, De Neve Holly Ridge, Sproul Cove, and Sproul Landing.</p>
<h3>Hospitality</h3>
<p>Hospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration.
The Hospitality department manages the UCLA Guest House, a full-service, on-campus hotel.
The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities.
The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40&nbsp;acre (0.2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) <a>convention center</a> in the <a>San Bernardino Mountains</a> near <a>Lake Arrowhead</a>.
Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering  a <a>Vending</a> operation, and summer conference center located on the Westwood campus.</p>
<h3>Chabad House</h3>
<p>The UCLA <a>Chabad House</a> is a community center for <a>Jewish</a> students operated by the <a>Orthodox Jewish</a> <a>Chabad</a> movement.
Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university.
In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House.
The present building was erected in their memory.
The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi <a>Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a> at <a>770 Eastern Parkway</a> in Brooklyn, New York.
