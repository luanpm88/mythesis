<p>   <strong>Santa Clara University</strong> is a private, co-educational <a>Jesuit</a>-affiliated university located in <a>Santa Clara</a>, California.
Chartered by the state of California and accredited by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>, it operates in collaboration with the <a>Society of Jesus</a> (Jesuits), whose members founded the school in 1851.
Santa Clara is the oldest operating institution of higher learning in California  and the oldest Catholic university in the American West.
It is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>
<h2>About Santa Clara University</h2>
<p>[[Image:Mission Santa Clara.jpg&#x200e;|left|thumb|300px|The
[[Mission Santa Clara de As&#x00ed;s|Santa Clara Mission]] is a notable on-campus landmark.]]
The university is situated in <a>Santa Clara, California</a> (2006 est.
population 108,518), adjacent to the city of <a>San Jose, California</a> in <a>Santa Clara County</a> (population 1.8 million), which anchors the southern part of the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.
Also known by the abbreviation SCU, its students and 71,000 alumni are called &#x201c;Santa Clarans&#x201d; and its athletics teams are called the Broncos.
On its official website the school is billed as &quot;The Jesuit University in <a>Silicon Valley</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Built around historic <a>Mission Santa Clara</a>, the present university is home to a population of nearly 5,000 undergraduate and 3,500 masters, <a>JD</a>, and PhD students.
The institution employs over 450 full time faculty members, who are divided between four professional schools and the College of Arts and Sciences, all of which are located on the 106 acre (0.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) mission campus.
In July 2009, the <a>Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley (JST)</a>, formerly an independent school, legally merged with the university taking the name &quot;Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University.&quot;
Although a division of SCU, the school retains its campus in <a>Berkeley, California</a>.
JST is one of two Jesuit <a>seminaries</a> in the United States with ecclesiastical faculties approved by the <a>Vatican's</a> <a>Congregation for Catholic Education</a>.
The other seminary, <a>Weston Jesuit School of Theology</a>, completed a similar affiliation with <a>Boston College</a> in June 2008, becoming <a>Boston College School of Theology and Ministry</a>.</p>
<p>For the 2008&#x2013;09 academic year, the university's operating budget was $311 million, and the university's endowment was over $697 million.
For the same period, undergraduate tuition and fees was $34,950 and the average cost of room and board was $11,067.</p>
<p>Santa Clara is civilly chartered and governed by a board of trustees, which appoints the president.
By internal statute, the president must be a member of the Jesuit order; although, the membership of the board is primarily lay.
About forty Jesuit priests and brothers are active teachers and administrators in various departments and centers located on the main campus in Santa Clara.
Additionally, fourteen Jesuits currently hold faculty positions at the university's Jesuit School of Theology located in Berkeley.
In total, Jesuits comprise around seven percent of the permanent faculty and hold teaching positions in biology, computer engineering, counseling psychology, economics, English, history, law, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religious studies, theology, and theater arts.
They also serve in campus ministry and residence-hall ministry, and some act as faculty directors in residential learning communities.</p>
<p>SCU maintains its Catholic and Jesuit affiliation and supports numerous initiatives intended to further its religious mission.
Students are invited to attend the Sunday evening student Masses in the mission church and encouraged to participate in campus ministry programs and lectures.
All bachelor&#x2019;s degrees require three religious studies courses as part of the academic core.
An emphasis on <a>social justice</a> is furthered through the Pedro Arrupe Partnership and Kolvenbach Solidarity Programs, which offer service opportunities in the community and immersion opportunities throughout the world.
The <a>Markkula Center for Applied Ethics</a> and the <a>Center for Science, Technology, and Society</a> also have programs that serve the university's Catholic, Jesuit identity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|250px|Mission Santa Clara de Asis in 1849</a> In 1777, the Blessed <a>Junipero Serra</a>, a Spanish <a>Franciscan</a> <a>friar</a>, had founded the Santa Clara church, as the eighth in the chain of Franciscan missions in <a>Alta California</a>, at the site of the future university.</p>
<p>In 1851, at the height of the <a>California Gold Rush</a>, at the request of the Bishop of Monterey, the Dominican <a>Joseph Sadoc Alemany</a>, Italian Jesuits <a>John Nobili</a> and Michael Accolti established the original Santa Clara College around Mission Santa Clara de As&#x00ed;s.</p>
<p>The year 1851 saw the foundation of California's first two colleges in the town of <a>Santa Clara</a> &#x2013; Santa Clara College and the Methodist-founded California Wesleyan College, now known as the <a>University of the Pacific</a> and located in <a>Stockton, California</a>.
Because Santa Clara College began instruction before the Methodist campus, Santa Clara calls itself the first institution of higher learning in the state.
With its 1851 foundation, Santa Clara College also became the first Catholic college west of <a>St.
Louis, Missouri</a>, where the Jesuit <a>Saint Louis University</a> traces its origins to 1818.
For its part, California Wesleyan obtained its state charter in July 1851, and for that reason its successor, the University of the Pacific, legitimately claims to be &quot;California's first chartered university&quot;.</p>
<p>Santa Clara's Jesuit founders eventually accumulated the endowment required for a charter, which was granted on April 28, 1855.</p>
<p>In 1857, Santa Clara awarded the first bachelor's degree given in California.
The recipient was Thomas I. Bergin.</p>
<p>In 1912, Santa Clara College became the University of Santa Clara with the addition of the <a>School of Engineering</a> and <a>School of Law</a>.</p>
<p>In 1925, the <a>Leavey School of Business</a> was added and became one of the first business schools in the United States to receive national accreditation.</p>
<p>In 1961, women were admitted to what had been initially an all-men's school.
This step made Santa Clara University the first Catholic university in California to admit both men and women.</p>
<p>In 1985, in part to avoid confusion with the <a>University of Southern California</a>, the University of Santa Clara, as it had been known since 1912, changed its name to Santa Clara University.
Beginning with the graduating class of 1986, diplomas began being printed with the new name, Santa Clara University.</p>
<p>In 2001, the <a>School of Education, Counseling Psychology, and Pastoral Ministries</a> was formed to offer master's level and other credential programs.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Over the last century, the Santa Clara University campus, located along the famed <a>El Camino Real</a> in Santa Clara, California, has expanded to more than 104 acres (42 <a>ha</a>).
Amid its many mission style academic and residential buildings are the historic mission gardens, rose garden, and palm trees.</p>
<h3>The modern campus</h3>
<p>In the 1950s, after the University constructed Walsh Hall and the <a>de Saisset Museum</a> on two of the last remaining open spaces on the old College campus, Santa Clara began purchasing and annexing land from the surrounding community.
The first addition, which occurred slightly earlier, brought space for football and baseball playing fields.
Thereafter, particularly in the 1960s when women were admitted to the school, more land was acquired for the Benson Memorial Center, <a>Toso Pavilion</a>, Orradre Library, Kennedy Mall residence halls, and other facilities.</p>
<p>In 1989, the rerouting of <a>The Alameda</a> (<a>California State Route 82</a>), a major thoroughfare that bisected the university &#x2013; and the closure of several interior roads unified the Santa Clara University campus.
In place of these streets emerged sparsely landscaped pedestrian malls and plazas.
The current five year <a>campus plan</a> calls for integration of these areas with the gardens of the campus core.
Already, the Saint Clare Garden, designed in the <a>medieval</a> style, works to this end.</p>
<p>The 1990s brought a number of campus additions, including the Music and Dance Building, a new science wing, the Arts and Sciences Building, the <a>Malley Fitness Center</a>, the Sobrato Residence Hall, and the first on-campus parking structure.
Santa Clara also carried out all deferred maintenance, including the renovation of Kenna Hall, the Adobe Lodge, and many other historic buildings.</p>
<p>One unique feature of Santa Clara University's undergraduate education is the Residential Learning Community program.
Eight Residential Learning Communities (RLCs), each with their own distinct themes, are charged with integrating the academic experience of the classroom and student communities in the residence halls.</p>
<h3>Contemporary changes</h3>
<p>Recently completed expansion projects include a new baseball field (<a>Stephen Schott Stadium</a>, 2005), a renovated basketball arena (<a>Leavey Center</a>, 2000), Kennedy Mall &#x2013; the campus' first &quot;green building&quot; (2005),  a Jesuit community residence (2006), a 194,000-square-foot (1.8 ha) state-of-the-art library (2008), and a new 85,000-square-foot (0.79 ha) building for the <a>Leavey School of Business</a> (2008).</p>
<h4>Santa Clara Island</h4>
<p>On May 24, 2007, an article published in <a>The Santa Clara</a> (campus newspaper) reported that SCU <a>IT</a> specialist Michael Ballen was heading a project to digitize the SCU campus in the virtual world <a>Second Life</a>.
Ballen purchased <em>Santa Clara Island</em> for $980 on a grant from the Technology Steering Committee.
Digital models of de Saisset Museum, Mission Church, and the new library are the first buildings to be featured on the island.
Ballen reported that student-created art will be featured in buildings and that, in time, he hopes students and staff will have opportunities to discuss courses offline and download pre-recorded lectures through the Second Life virtual world.
Ballen stated that his &quot;main emphasis [is] teaching and learning&quot;, and that: &quot;It's a way to get to the people who like to game and get them exposed to educational material.&quot;</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right</a></p>
<p>The school colors are red and white (the school's football team uniforms featured gold trim) and the team mascot is the &quot;bronco,&quot; in past illustrations depicted as a &quot;<a>bucking bronco</a>.&quot;</p>
<h3>Athletic programs</h3>
<p> On February 2, 1993, Santa Clara president <a>Paul Locatelli</a>, S.J. announced the discontinuation of football at the university.
This decision was probably driven in part by legal ruling Title IX, which requires equal funding for men's and women's athletics.
The football program, which was Division 1-AA (not Division II, as previously reported on this page), required more funding per male student-athlete, compared to the average funding per female student-atlete.
Other teams were/are Division I, including the men's and women's soccer teams, both of which are past NCAA Division I National Champions.
The basketball teams have also made regular appearances in NCAA Division I playoffs.
The demise of the football program disappointed students, staff, alumni, boosters, and fans; many made the case for keeping the sport by citing a long Santa Clara football tradition.
Cited in particular were the 1930s-1950s heyday  comprising major bowl appearances, nationally recognized teams coached by Lawrence [Buck] Shaw and Edward [Slip] Madigan, victories over favored ranked teams, and the long-standing traditional game with cross-bay rival Saint Mary's College.
Despite the wide recognition of football's place in the university's history, there is no indication that the sport will be reinstated in the future.</p>
<p>Santa Clara University fields athletic programs that compete at the highest university levels, including those of <a>soccer</a> and volleyball, consistently ranked among the top ten or twenty teams nationally.
One year after winning the national title in 2001, the women's soccer program was mentioned several times in <em><a>Bend It Like Beckham</a></em>, a hit British film.</p>
<p>The men's soccer team has reached the championship match of the <a>College Cup</a> three times.
In 1989, they faced the <a>University of Virginia</a> and played to a 1&#x2013;1 tie that was called due to darkness after 2 overtimes, earning both Santa Clara and Virginia a share of the National Championship.
In 1991 they again faced Virginia and again tied after regulation, this time 0-0, but lost to the <a>Cavaliers</a> on penalty kicks.
In 1999, they lost to <a>Indiana University</a>, 0&#x2013;1.</p>
<p>The men's basketball team has participated in the NCAA tournament on several occasions in past decades; the 1992&#x2013;1993 team (led by future NBA MVP <a>Steve Nash</a>) was one of 4 #15 seeds to defeat a #2 seed in the tourney.</p>
<p>On February 12, 2007, the men's basketball team snapped Gonzaga's 50 game home winning streak.
At the time, it was the longest ongoing home winning streak in the <a>NCAA</a>.</p>
<h3>Noted Club Sports Programs</h3>
<p>In 2008, the Santa Clara Men's rugby club made it to National playoffs which were held that year in Orem, Utah.
They ousted a powerful Western Washington club before falling to eventual division champion Utah Valley State.
The Santa Clara University Touring Side (SCUTS) have built upon that success and followed with a strong 2009 campaign.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Santa Clara Paintball Team made it to the final rounds of the NCPA competition in Florida.</p>
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a>Buck Shaw Stadium</a>: Named for Lawrence T.&quot;Buck&quot; Shaw, the school's most successful football coach (1936&#x2013;1942) and who later coached at the <a>University of California</a> and with the <a>San Francisco 49ers</a> and <a>Philadelphia Eagles</a>, the stadium was the longtime home of Bronco football and baseball.
&quot;Buck Shaw&quot; is now entirely dedicated to SCU's nationally ranked soccer programs.
Buck Shaw Stadium undertook drastic changes after the 2007 season as it is expanded to seat 10,300 as well as the pitch and stadium facilities being modernized and improved.
This was all due to the stadium becoming the temporary home for <a>Major League Soccer</a> team, the <a>San Jose Earthquakes</a>, who began their return to the league in April, 2008.
Although no concrete plan is in place for a <a>soccer specific stadium</a>, the move is expected to last between two and three years.</li>
<li>Bellomy Field: Bellomy is used for intramural sports and for casual student use.</li>
<li><a>Malley Fitness Center</a>: Malley is open to the university community for recreational sports, indoor intramurals, weightlifting, and fitness classes.</li>
<li><a>Kids on Campus</a>: Santa Clara University's child care and preschool center since 1969.
Serves children of SCU students, faculty, staff and alumni.
The program accommodates infants six weeks old to children age 6.</li>
  <li><a>Leavey Center</a>: Santa Clara's arena provides space for basketball and volleyball teams.
The Leavey Center is also used as a concert venue and a hall for large lectures and speeches.

<h2>ROTC</h2>
<p>The Santa Clara <a>US Army</a> <a>ROTC</a> Battalion and SCUs military history dates back to the <a>American Civil War</a>.
An official organization of the basic military unit was established in 1861 due to the outbreak of the war.
The unit was known as the Senior Company of Cadets.
As with the rest of the nation, the Civil War brought on strong feelings for the students and their families.
As a result, parents who sympathized with the Confederacy withdrew their sons from school, while other young men left Santa Clara to join the Union forces.
By 26 November 1862, the Junior Company of Cadets, consisting of younger classmen, was established.
However, the Junior Division was short lived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on 10 September 1863, <a>Leland Stanford</a>, the Governor of California at the time, presented the Corps of Cadets with forty Springfield rifles, Model 1839.
In return for his generosity, an armory was built in his honor.
In 1936, the armory was located southwest of the athletic field with the pistol range located below the stage of the auditorium.
Today, the rifles are preserved in the University Museum.</p>
<p>The <a>Jesuits</a> greatly support the battalion.
Fr. <a>Paul Locatelli</a>, S.J., (former) President of Santa Clara, was a cadet at the university prior to his military service and his entrance into the Jesuit Order.
Also, it is known that two Jesuits from Santa Clara, Fr.'s W. D. McKinnon and J. P. McQuaide volunteered as Chaplains in the <a>Spanish-American War</a>.
Both men were part of the American Expeditionary Force that was with <a>Theodore Roosevelt</a> when he made his attack at <a>San Juan Hill</a> on 1 July 1898.

<p>On Feb. 2, 2010 the Santa Clara University ROTC &#x201c;Bronco Battalion&#x201d; won the prestigious MacArthur Award granted by the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Cadet Command and the General Douglas MacArthur Foundation.</p>
<p>The award, named after late General Douglas MacArthur, is granted to the year&#x2019;s most excellent Reserve Officers' Training Corps program among 33 battalions in the West Coast 8th Brigade.
The award takes into consideration factors such as the battalion&#x2019;s physical fitness, navigation skills, leadership, and success in commissioning officers after ROTC.</p>
