<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Haas School of Business was first established as the College of Commerce of the <a>University of California</a> in 1898.
The University of California charter, adopted in 1868, included among its goals the study of commerce.
University Regents Arthur Rodgers, A.S. Hallidie and George T. Marye Jr. later proposed the establishment of a College of Commerce.
The new college was founded on September 13, 1898, when Cora Jane Flood, daughter of industrialist and University of California Regent <a>James C. Flood</a>, donated land to the University specifically to support the study of commerce.
The school was the third collegiate business school in the United States and the first at a public university.</p>
<p>The college&#x2019;s first faculty members included some American pioneers in the field of business.
Simon Litman taught the first course in marketing between 1902 and 1908.
Adolph Miller, who was the Flood Professor of the Political Economy and Commerce from 1903 to 1915, later served on the first Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
<a>Wesley Clair Mitchell</a>, who taught at Berkeley from 1905 to 1913, is known as the father of the business cycle analysis.
Charles Staehling taught accounting at the college from 1921&#x2013;51 and was known for adding a theoretical framework to the praxis-oriented teaching of accounting principles.
Henry Mowbray, who taught from 1910 to 1948, wrote the first college textbook on insurance.</p>
<p>The College of Commerce was founded in the liberal arts tradition, drawing on faculty from other disciplines on campus.
Carl C. Plehn was appointed the first Dean of the new college in 1898.
Plehn, a finance professor educated in Germany, drafted the college's first curriculum for a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree.
The initial course offerings covered legal studies, political studies, political economy, and historical studies, including The History of the Institution of Private Property, History and Principles of Commercial Ethics, and the History of Commerce in All Countries and at Every Age.
Plehn proposed changes to the curriculum in 1915 to give it a more professional focus.
The proposal, adopted after <a>World War I</a>, established a program that included two years of liberal arts education followed by junior and senior year commerce study, a pattern still used for the undergraduate program today.</p>
<p>Henry Rand Hatfield, a pioneer in accounting and an early entrant in the <a>Accounting Hall of Fame</a>, became the second Dean of the college in 1916.
Hatfield had been hired by the University of California in 1904 as the first full-time accounting professor in the country.
Hatfield played a leading role in the founding of the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a> and the national honor society <a>Beta Gamma Sigma</a>.
He also published the first paper in the United States on accounting theory.
As Dean, Hatfield sought to increase the reputation of the College of Commerce by bringing scholars from the East Coast to teach during summer sessions.</p>
<p>After World War I, enrollment experienced an increase from the influx of veterans and continued to grow even through the <a>Great Depression</a>, increasing from its initial class size of three in 1898 to 1,540 students in 1938.
In 1925, the college's third Dean, Stuart Daggett, instituted a two-year <a>Master of Science</a> degree.
The school's fourth Dean, Henry Francis Grady, was appointed in 1928.
Grady went on leave from 1934 to 1936 to become an advisor to President <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, for whom he worked on reciprocal trade agreements (see <a>Reciprocal Tariff Act</a>).
The fifth Dean, Robert Calkins, succeeded Grady, but left within a few years to become the Dean of the <a>Columbia Business School</a>.</p>
<p>E.T. Grether was appointed the sixth Dean of the College of Commerce in 1941.
Grether's twenty-year tenure as Dean was a time of great change.
The college was renamed the Department of Business Administration in 1942 and began offering a new two-year upper division curriculum leading to the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> in <a>Business Administration</a>.
In 1943, the department was renamed the School of Business Administration when it began offering a one-year graduate program.
</p>
<p>Grether opened several research centers in the school, including The Institute for Business and Economics Research (1941), The Institute for Industrial Relations (IIR) (1945, now called the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment), and the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics (1950).
Grether tapped <a>Clark Kerr</a> to be the first director of the IIR.
Kerr's success in this position led to his becoming the first <a>Chancellor</a> of the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>The Graduate School of Business Administration was opened in 1955 and the school begin offering a course of study leading to the <a>Master of Business Administration</a>.
A year later the <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> in Business Administration and executive education programs were founded.</p>
<p>Under the school's eighth Dean, Richard Holton, an evening MBA program was initiated in 1972.
Unlike other evening or part-time programs in the country, students were required to meet the same admission requirements as established for the day-time MBA program.
Classes for the evening MBA were held in downtown San Francisco until the school's present building complex was completed in 1995.</p>
<p>Earl F. Cheit became the ninth Dean of the school in 1976.
Facing diminishing funding and budget pressures, Cheit lobbied and won increased salary scales for business faculty.
He also secured donations from <a>Walter A. Haas</a> to endow seven new chairs and to open a career planning and placement center.
In 1980, the school began to offer a Management of Technology program jointly with the <a>College of Engineering</a>.
1980 also saw the inauguration of the annual Haas Competition in Business and Social Policy, funded by a donation from the Evelyn and <a>Walter A. Haas, Jr.</a> Foundation.</p>
<p>In 1987, the tenth Dean of the school, Raymond Miles, began the school's first major capital campaign to raise money for a new building.
Major contributions were made by  <a>Wells Fargo</a> and Eugene Trefethen, an executive with <a>Kaiser Industries</a>.
In 1989, the Walter and Elise Haas Fund donated $23.75 million to the building campaign.
The donation was the largest in the history of the University to that date.
The school was renamed the Haas School of Business in honor of that gift.</p>
<p>The new building was designed by Charles W. Moore, former chair of Berkeley's Department of Architecture.
Construction began in 1993 and the school moved into its new building complex in January 1995.</p>
<p><a>Laura Tyson</a>, a professor at Berkeley since 1977 and the Chairman of the President's <a>Council of Economic Advisers</a> from 1993 to 1995 during the <a>Clinton Administration</a>, was the Dean of the school from 1998 to 2001.
Tyson negotiated an agreement with the <a>Columbia Business School</a> to create a joint program, the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA, which offers experienced executives the opportunity to earn an MBA from both Haas and Columbia.
The Berkeley-Columbia program began in 2002 and graduated its first class in December, 2003.
</p>
<p><a>Tom Campbell</a> became Dean in 2002.
Campbell established The Center for Responsible Business at Haas in 2003 with gifts from former <a>Apple Inc.</a> and <a>Netscape</a> executive Mike Homer, actor <a>Paul Newman</a>, and former Chairman of <a>Bank of America</a> Rudolph Peterson.
From 2004 to 2005, Campbell took a leave of absence to serve as director of the California Department of Finance in the <a>Schwarzenegger</a> administration.
During Campbell's absence, Richard Lyons served as acting Dean.
Lyons initiated the keystone program Leading Through Innovation at Haas in 2004.
Lyons was the Executive Associate Dean from 2005-2006, before leaving for the position of Chief Learning Officer at <a>Goldman Sachs</a>, New York.</p>
<p>In July 2008, <a>Richard Lyons</a> succeeded Campbell to become the present Dean of Haas.
Lyons has implemented a series of changes to the Haas School's core MBA curriculum, pursuing a strategy called &quot;Berkeley Innovative Leader Development&quot; (BILD).
BILD is an attempt to reconcile traditional management education, the Haas motto of &quot;Leading Through Innovation,&quot; and the recent turn towards ethical and values-based education in business schools.
The curriculum changes are predicated on what Lyons and others consider the unique culture of Haas, as defined by four distinct elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Question the status quo</strong>: an innovative leader will challenge convention, &quot;taking intelligent risks and accepting sensible failures.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Confidence without attitude</strong>: innovative leaders make decisions based on evidence and analysis, not arrogance.</li>
<li><strong>Students always</strong>: innovative leadership demands &quot;curiosity and lifelong pursuit of personal and intellectual growth.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Beyond yourself</strong>: an innovative leader should also lead ethically and responsibly, considering the long-term effects of actions and decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practical terms, BILD has resulted in three completely new core courses (out of 12) and a revamping of the remaining nine.
Rather than discarding conventional management courses, Haas faculty have retooled their existing curriculum to focus on &quot;15 specific skills, including experimentation, revenue-model innovation and risk selection.&quot;</p>
<p>Lyons has also launched the public phase of a $300 million capital campaign, called the <a>Campaign for Haas</a>.
The campaign's stated goals are &quot;transforming the... campus, building a curriculum based on the Berkeley-Haas approach to leadership, and aggressively expanding the school&#x2019;s faculty and its support for research.&quot;</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business has been home to two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.
<a>John C. Harsanyi</a> (1920-2000) was a co-recipient with <a>John Nash</a> and <a>Reinhard Selten</a> in 1994 for his contributions to the study of <a>game theory</a> and its application to <a>economics</a>.
He served as Professor Emeritus at Haas and in the UC Berkeley Department of Economics.
<a>Oliver Williamson</a> (1932-) was a co-recipient with <a>Elinor Ostrom</a> in 2009 for his &quot;analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm,&quot; and currently serves as Professor Emeritus at Haas and in the UC Berkeley Department of Economics.</p>
<h2>Full-time MBA Program</h2>
<p>The Berkeley <a>MBA</a> Program is a two-year curriculum designed to prepare students for the business world in an experience that Haas calls &quot;Leading Through Innovation.&quot;
The process of &quot;Leading Through Innovation&quot; includes the core MBA curriculum and specialization in an area of interest, which may be one of seven areas of general management fundamentals, or a certification in one of five different areas of study.
Another important part of the Haas MBA is the combination of executive skills seminars, such as the Leadership Development Series, and experiential programs, such as &quot;Haas@Work,&quot; an applied innovation program that sends teams of Berkeley MBA students to work at large firms.</p>
<h3>Areas of Concentration</h3>
<p>The Haas School offers seven areas of general management fundamentals for students to focus on using elective courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accounting</li>
  <li>Business &amp; Public Policy</li>
  <li>Economic Analysis &amp; Public Policy</li>
  <li>Finance</li>
  <li>Management of Organizations</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>
  <li>Operations &amp; Information Technology Management</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, students can earn a certificate in one of five areas of study:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Global Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Real Estate</a></li>
  <li><a>Health Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Entrepreneurship</a></li>
  <li><a>Technology</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students can also specialize in <a>Corporate Social Responsibility</a> or <a>Nonprofit and Public Leadership</a>, although no certificate program is available for these areas.</p>
<h3>Haas@Work</h3>
<p>Haas@Work is an applied innovation program operated by the Haas School's Institute for Business Innovation.
The program assigns teams of Berkeley MBA students to work on competitive projects at large firms.
After collaborating with host executives on innovative solutions to business problems, the students are tasked with implementing their ideas.
The Haas@Work program has paired Haas MBA students with companies including <a>Visa</a>, <a>Wells Fargo</a>, <a>Cisco</a>, <a>Disney</a>, <a>Panasonic</a>, and <a>Clorox</a>.</p>
<h2>Evening &amp; Weekend MBA Program</h2>
<p>The three-year, part-time Berkeley Evening &amp; Weekend <a>MBA</a> Program emphasizes the delivery of growth and innovation to organizations, and allows participants to continue working full-time while pursuing the MBA.
Like the full-time MBA, the part-time MBA program is built around &quot;Leadership Through Innovation,&quot; and like full-time students, part-time MBA students can specialize in one of seven areas of general management fundamentals.
However, the certificate programs available to full-time MBA students are not available to those on the part-time track.
Evening &amp; Weekend MBA students can focus on several special interests in addition to the general management fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Global Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Real Estate</a></li>
  <li><a>Entrepreneurship</a></li>
  <li><a>Corporate Social Responsibility</a></li>
  <li><a>Technology</a></li>
  <li><a>Nonprofit and Public Leadership</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA Program</h2>
<p>The Haas School of Business offers an Executive MBA Program in partnership with the <a>Columbia Business School</a>.
One session per term is held at the <a>Columbia University</a> campus in <a>New York City</a>, the other four are held on campus at the Haas School of Business in <a>Berkeley, CA</a>.
While enrolled in the program, students stay at the Shattuck Plaza Hotel in Berkeley and at the Sheraton in New York City.
Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools.
The core curriculum is taught during the first three terms, and the last two terms offer elective courses.
Students may opt to spend one term studying exclusively in the NY-EMBA program at Columbia or in the other MBA programs offered at Berkeley.
Upon completion of the program, students earn two MBAs, one from UC Berkeley and one from Columbia University, the same degrees awarded in the schools' full-time MBA programs.</p>
<h2>Ph.D. program</h2>
<p>The Haas School of Business <a>Ph.D.</a> Program offers seven fields of academic study and close collaboration with faculty members.
The program is very exclusive, admitting only 14-16 candidates per year, and students can expect to graduate in four to five years.
Ph.D. students are generally expected to serve as either teaching or research assistants for part of their time at Haas.</p>
<h3>Fields of Study</h3>
<p>Haas Ph.D. students can specialize in one of seven fields of study.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accounting</li>
  <li>Business and Public Policy</li>
  <li>Finance</li>
  <li>Management of Organizations (formerly Organizational Behavior &amp; Industrial Relations)</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>

Students in the MFE program take an integrated set of courses for a period of one year, and must also complete a ten-week internship or on-site project and an applied finance project that builds on skills learned in the internship.
One hundred percent of the Haas MFE class of 2009 graduated directly into jobs with companies including <a>Goldman Sachs</a>, <a>Novellus</a>, <a>Allstate Insurance</a>, and <a>Deutsche Bank</a>.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate Program</h2>
<p>The Haas School of Business, in conjunction with the main <a>UC Berkeley</a> campus, offers an undergraduate <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree intended to provide the knowledge and technical skills necessary for success in the modern business world.
Students take core courses in Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Business Communication, and Organizational Behavior, as well as elective courses in other areas.
Undergraduates enter Haas at the beginning of their junior year, and graduate within two years.
It ranked no. 2 in the nation according to U.S. News College ranking.
</p>
<p>Haas sponsors a wide variety of student organizations, including ethnic groups, case competition clubs, and organizations for a wide variety of business-related pursuits including finance, real estate, marketing, consulting, and others.
Consulting organizations like <a>The Berkeley Group</a> and <a>Berkeley Consulting</a> recruit and train undergraduate students to work on consulting engagements with real-world clients.
Ethnic-based organizations like the Asian Business Association unite students of similar ethnicity for professional development and networking.</p>
<h2>Executive Education</h2>
<p>The Haas School's <a>Center for Executive Education</a> offers a variety of custom and open-enrollment programs to help corporate executives understand specific new or challenging aspects of the business world, drawing on the research of Haas faculty members.
