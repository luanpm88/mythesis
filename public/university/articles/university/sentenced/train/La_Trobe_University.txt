<p> <strong>La Trobe University</strong> is a multi-campus university in <a>Victoria</a>, Australia.
It was established in 1964 as Victoria&#x2019;s third university by an Act of Parliament.
The main campus of La Trobe is located in the <a>Melbourne</a> suburb of <a>Bundoora</a>; two other major campuses are located in the Victorian city of <a>Bendigo</a> and the NSW-Victorian border centre of <a>Albury-Wodonga</a>.
The university has a number of smaller campuses at <a>Mildura</a>, <a>Shepparton</a>, and <a>Beechworth</a> as well as a campus in Melbourne's <a>CBD</a>.</p>
<p>La Trobe offers <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> courses across five major <a>faculties</a>, covering all the main learning areas: Education, Health Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Law and Management, and Science, Technology and Engineering.
La Trobe is considered to be particularly strong in the area of <a>arts</a> and <a>humanities</a>; this was reflected in the 2005 <a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a>, where it was ranked amongst the top 25 institutions in the world in this category and third best in Australia.
It also has a strong international reputation in <a>biomedicine</a>, as demonstrated when the Times ranked it in the top 100 biomedicine universities in the world in this same year (13th in Australia).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>The passing of the Act of <a>Victorian Parliament</a> to establish La Trobe University followed earlier University Acts to establish the <a>University of Melbourne</a> (1853) and <a>Monash University</a> (1958).
The Minister of Education at the time and the appointed planning council were 'unanimous in their enthusiasm that the new institution should be innovative in its approach', and the University adopted an academic structure based on schools of studies (rather than on faculties) and a collegiate format, where a large number of students lived on campus.
At this time, <a>Flinders University</a> and <a>Macquarie University</a> were also in the processes of establishing a schools-based system.</p>
<p>Many prominent Victorians were involved in La Trobe's establishment process, and there was a strong belief that it was important to increase research and learning in Victoria.
One of the major individuals involved was <a>Davis McCaughey</a>, who later became <a>Governor of Victoria</a>.
The University was named after <a>Charles Joseph La Trobe</a>, the first Governor of Victoria, and the University motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto.
The La Trobe University <a>Coat of Arms</a> incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, as well as the Australian Wedge-Tailed Eagle to represent Australia and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.</p>
<h3>Early Years</h3>
<p>La Trobe University was officially opened by Victorian premier Sir <a>Henry Bolte</a> on the 8th of March, 1967 in a ceremony that was attended by a number of dignitaries including the <a>Prime Minister of Australia</a> <a>Robert Menzies</a>.
Teaching commenced at the Bundoora campus in the first semester of that year, with some 500 students.
La Trobe was seen to be unique amongst Australian universities due to its schools-based, collegiate structure.
At the time, &quot;this novel approach became commonly known in the university as 'The La Trobe Concept'&quot;.
Within 4 years, however, this format had all but broken down, with the collegiate ideal reduced to halls of residence and the schools becoming departmentalized.</p>
<p>The Bendigo campus of La Trobe dates back to 1873: the Bendigo College of Advanced Education officially amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991, completing a process that began in the late 1980s as part of the <a>Dawkins reforms</a> to higher education.
During the merger process, a controversial issue erupted when the university's head office in Bundoora raised concerns about the academic standards at Bendigo CAE.
This led to a public outcry in which Bendigo CAE students threatened the Bendigo Advertiser over publishing the matter in its newspapers.
Several newspapers were burned in the protest.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Wodonga Institute of Tertiary Education took place in the same year.
The university has continued to expand, with the opening of the Research and Development Park at Bundoora, and the upcoming opening of a second Melbourne CBD site.</p>
<h3>Funding and cutbacks</h3>
<p>In recent times, the University has suffered cutbacks in government funding , a problem experienced across most of the Australian higher education sector.
In some areas though La Trobe has lost a greater proportion than others.
For instance, the History Department at the university was once by far the largest of any institution in Australia, however funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size.
In 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts.</p>
<p>Recent higher education reforms by the <a>Howard government</a> have allowed Australian universities to increase fees and take in a greater number of full-fee paying students, and despite a large student backlash, La Trobe has taken advantage of the reforms, increasing fees by 25% in 2005.</p>
<p>The university's African Research Institute, the only major African studies centre in Australasia, was closed at the end of 2006..
In 2008, the university cut of the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the Bendigo campus, the change resulted in the stream only being taught as a minor.</p>
<p>In 2008, La Trobe was operating with a $1.46 million dollar surplus but has highlighted that by 2010 it will &quot;review, and where appropriate, restructure all academic, administrative and committee structures&quot;  to deal with diminished student intakes, falling entrance marks, below-par scores on student satisfaction surveys and a decreasing proportion of national research funding.
In an attempt to address these issues, the university is making cut backs and restructuring several courses under the direction of the Vice Chancellor, <a>Paul Johnson</a>. .
Osborne had been in the position since 1990 and in one of the most controversial events in the university's administrative history, his tenure was extended for seven years in 1994 by then Chancellor <a>Nancy Millis</a> without consultation of the board.</p>
<p>The current Chancellor is <a>Sylvia Walton</a>, <a>AO</a>, appointed by the University Council 23 April 2006 after Nancy Millis' retirement.</p>
<p>Former Governor of Victoria, <a>Richard McGarvie</a>, was Chancellor from 1981-1992.</p>
<h2>Notable Graduates</h2>
<p></p>
<p>La Trobe University has produced many notable <a>alumni</a>.</p>
<h2>Academia</h2>
<p>The University has five faculties offering courses at all levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Faculty of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Health Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Law and Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Science, Technology and Engineering</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Student organizations</h2>
<p> During the 1970s and 1980s, La Trobe, along with Monash, was considered to have the most politically active student body of any university in Australia .
The <a>Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist)</a> was a prominent organisation on campus, often with the cover of a front organisation sometimes encouraging the name 'La Trot'.
The following La Trobe alumni were all good friends at the time and took part in student politics: <a>Bill Kelty</a> from the <a>ACTU</a> and <a>AFL</a> Commissioner, former <a>Treasurer</a> <a>Tony Sheehan</a>, <a>Don Watson</a>, <a>Geoff Walsh</a> (<a>Bob Hawke</a>'s <a>press secretary</a>, High profile union officials <a>Brian Boyd</a>, <a>John Cummins</a> and <a>Garry Weaven</a>, former federal treasury official and now <a>Westpac</a> <a>CEO</a>, <a>David Morgan</a>.
Some other <a>Labor</a> figures and people from the left side of politics include <a>Mary Delahunty</a>, <a>Phil Cleary</a> and <a>Michael Danby</a>.
Despite the general socialist/leftist atmosphere several conservative corporate/business figures and <a>Liberal</a></p>
<p>Though the student body at La Trobe is no longer as politically active as it once was, the trend is similar at all Australian universities.
Nonetheless, <a>Socialist Alternative</a>, and Australian Labor Students (ALS) are still very active, with both the SRC and Union President coming from ALS. La Trobe student organisations (both SRC and Union) have been largely run by ALS over previous years, in coalition with various independent groupings.</p>
<p>There are two main student representative bodies on campus.
The La Trobe University Students' Union is responsible for the Eagle Bar, Contact Student Services but its role has been considerably diminished as a consequence of <a>Voluntary Student Unionism</a>.
It has now changed its name and is known as the La Trobe University Student Guild.
The <a>La Trobe University Student Representative Council</a>, the principal representative body on campus, has a student advocate as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare.
It also publishes a student magazine, the notorious <a><em>Rabelais</em></a>, which was the subject of a <a>Federal Court</a> case in 1995 after the Office of Film and Literature Classification ruled that it <em>&quot;...promotes, incites and instructs in matters of crime&quot;</em> because of an article on shoplifting (reprinted from elsewhere).
The Student Representative Council has also been severely affected by VSU but its role continues to be one of the most significant in ensuring students are politically represented on campus.</p>
<p>The largest faculty-based student representative organisation on campus is the Law Students Association (LSA).
Postgraduate students are dually represented by SRC and the La Trobe University Postgraduate Association.</p>
<p>The students at the Bendigo campus are represented by the Bendigo Student Association (BSA), a much less activist and political organisation than the student union.
The BSA publishes the <em>3rd Degree</em> magazine.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Melbourne (Bundoora)</h3>
<p><a>thumb|230px|Moat and George Singer Building, La Trobe University Bundoora Campus</a> The Bundoora campus is the foundation campus of La Trobe and was officially opened in 1967 when La Trobe first began operations.
The campus is set on 3.3 square kilometres (reputedly the largest university campus in the <a>Southern Hemisphere</a>) and is the home of most of the University's centres and institutions.
The campus is the main base of all La Trobe's main courses except education, pharmacy, and dentistry, all of which are based at Bendigo.
The main campus buildings were designed by Melbourne architecture firm, <a>Yuncken Freeman</a> in a utilitarian, Post-War International style.
Main campus buildings are connected by a series of raised walkways.</p>
<p>Bundoora has around 30,000 students on campus and subsequently has many facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops, banks and an art gallery.
The main library on the campus, the Borchardt[<a>http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/</a>], has well over one million volumes.</p>
<p>La Trobe University has three on-campus residential colleges: Menzies, Glenn and Chisholm.</p>
<p>Bundoora also has substantial sporting and recreation facilities such as an indoor pool, gyms, playing fields, and indoor stadiums.
The facilities are regularly used as a training base for the <a>Essendon Football Club</a>, and houses the administration &amp; training venue of the new <a>A-League</a> franchise <a>Melbourne Heart</a>.</p>
<p>The Bundoora campus is home to the <a>La Trobe University Medical Centre and Hospital</a>.
The Melbourne Wildlife Sanctuary, part of the university, is adjacent to the campus.</p>
<p>The University is also home to the <a>Centre for Dialogue</a>, an interdisciplinary research institution which delves into certain intercultural and inter-religious conflicts, both in the domestic setting and in <a>international relations</a>.
In March 2009, the Centre attracted controversy in hosting a lecture given by former Iranian President,  H. E. Sayed Mohammed Khatami (1997-2005).
Khatami emphasised the importance of dialogue between civilizations, especially in relation to quelling misunderstandings between the Islamic world and the West.
The Centre for Dialogue has also won acclaim for its leadership programme for young Muslims, implemented predominantly in Melbourne's northern suburbs.

<h3>Bendigo</h3>
<p>The Bendigo campus of La Trobe University was established in 1973, as the Bendigo College of Advanced Education.
This was officially amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991.
The Bendigo campus operates on three sites.</p>
<p>The largest is Edwards Rd Campus.
This is located three kilometres from the centre of Bendigo and is set on 33 hectares of land.
It is the home of the university's Faculty of Education and most of the other faculties have operations there.
The Heyward Library is also located here.</p>
<p>The Osbourne St Campus is a smaller Bendigo campus that is mainly used for examination facilities and is home to the La Trobe University Bendigo Athletics Track.</p>
<p>The smallest of the three is the La Trobe Visual Arts Centre.
This is a gallery located in Bendigo's View Street arts precinct, opening in 2005.
Its architectural design was controversial.
</p>
<p>The associated <a>Central Victorian Innovation Park</a> opened in December 2003.</p>
<p>The major facilities used in the 2004 <a>Commonwealth Youth Games</a> were located at La Trobe Bendigo.</p>
<p>Between 1994 and 2005, La Trobe Bendigo's curriculum was separate from that based at Bundoora, operated by a multidisciplinary Faculty of Regional Development.
All campuses could choose to offer individual courses from both Bundoora and Bendigo.
This situation ceased in 2005.
</p>
<h3>Melbourne (City)</h3>
<p>This Melbourne (City) campus is located in Franklin Street in Melbourne's <a>central business district</a>, opposite the <a>Queen Victoria Market</a>.
The campus delivers courses in health sciences, law and management; and houses some of the university's research centres.</p>
<h3>Albury-Wodonga</h3>
<p>The Albury Wodonga Campus is located three kilometres from the centre of <a>Wodonga</a> on a 26 hectare site.
Originally the sole campus of the Wodonga Institute of TAFE, the La Trobe campus was established in 1991.
The campus continues to share various resources with the TAFE.
The A-W campus houses the faculties of education, health sciences, biology, business and others.</p>
<h3>Mildura</h3>
<p>The Mildura Campus was established in 1996, co-located with the main campus of the <a>Sunraysia Institute of TAFE</a>.
These institutions and other tertiary education and research institutions on the site share various resources.</p>
<p>A second Mildura City campus opened in 2006 in the old Mildura Cultivator offices, next to &quot;Gallery 25&quot;, an art gallery La Trobe became involved with a few years earlier.</p>
<h3>Shepparton</h3>
<p>The Shepparton campus was established in 1994.
The new $10m campus building at 210 Fryers St. was recently opened.</p>
