I love the place.
It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the <a>Laurel Highlands</a> in <a>west-central Pennsylvania</a>, an hour east of Pittsburgh.
On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in <a>Scotland</a>.
Classic, wonderful slice of <a>Americana</a>.
If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.&quot;<em></em></p>

<h3>Commencement Speakers</h3>
<p>President <a>George W. Bush</a> spoke at the spring commencement ceremony in 2007.
Then-President Towey had previously served as director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Intiatives from 2002 to 2006.
</p>
<p>The 2008 speaker was <a>Mike Tomlin</a>, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>Sen.
<a>Bob Casey, Jr.</a> was scheduled to speak in 2009, but decided to withdraw for unknown reasons.
He was replaced by J. Christopher Donahue, the Chairman of the Board of the St. Vincent College Corporation.
Donahue is president and <a>CEO</a> of <a>Federated Investors</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, the commencement speaker was <a>Manfred Honeck</a>, director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<h3>Controversies</h3>
<h4>Conflict with faculty</h4>
<p>Towey has faced some difficulties in his relationships with faculty members at St. Vincent.
In April 2008, he attributed much of the dissension to a clash of cultures with the predominantly Benedictine faculty, who were not accustomed to rapid change, and to the fact that he was &quot;new to academia&quot;.
In early 2008 a letter to the school board, signed by three-quarters of the school's tenured faculty, said that Towey had created &quot;an unparalleled crisis&quot;, accusing Towey of &quot;sanitizing the self-study portion of the school's re-accreditation effort and displaying heavy-handed tactics in the search for an academic vice president,&quot; when he hired an untenured academic dean.</p>
<h4>Fr.
Mark Gruber controversy</h4>
<p>In November 2009 reports began emerging in which Towey accused a Priest/Professor, Father Mark Gruber, of sexual misconduct.
In August 2009, local police were summoned to campus to investigate alleged instances of child pornography found on an open access computer outside Gruber's office.
The police closed the case noting that, in addition to the open access to the computer, there was no evidence a crime had been committed - images of nude men were found, but no subjects could be identified as being under 18.
Nonetheless, President Towey, Archabbot Douglas Nowicki and Bishop of the Greensburg Diocese Lawrence Brandt acted to immediately ban Gruber from his pastoral duties and to relieve him from his post as Professor of Anthropology.</p>
<p>Some suggested these actions were in retaliation for Fr.
Gruber's outspoken criticisms of the Towey administration.
While Towey himself has not addressed these critics, administration spokespeople have denied the charges.
Criticisms arguing that the administration perverted <a>canon law</a> in an attempt to subvert longstanding traditions of academic freedom, integrity and collegiality have not been addressed.
The American Association of University Professors, alumni of Saint Vincent College as well as thousands of Fr.
Gruber's friends and colleagues have come to his defense.</p>
<h2>Basilica</h2>
<p>[[Image:SaintVincentBasilica.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Saint
Vincent College [[Basilica]]]]</p>

A church was built and dedicated on July 19, 1835.

Vincent de Paul</a> because July 19 is his feast day.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the basilica was laid in 1892, and the consecration took place on August 24, 1905.
The basilica was completely restored in 1996, as part of the 150th anniversary of the founding of the college.&lt;ref
