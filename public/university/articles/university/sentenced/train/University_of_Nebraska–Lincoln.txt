<p>The <strong>University of Nebraska&#x2013;Lincoln</strong> (<strong>Nebraska</strong>, <strong>UNL</strong> or <strong>NU</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in <a>Lincoln, Nebraska</a> in the <a>United States</a>.
It is the flagship campus of the <a>University of Nebraska system</a>, which includes other satellite campuses in <a>Omaha</a> and <a>Kearney</a>, and is the largest university in the state.</p>
<p>The university was founded in 1869 as a <a>land-grant university</a> under the 1862 <a>Morrill Act</a>, two years after Nebraska's statehood.
Around the turn of the century, the university began to expand significantly, hiring professors from <a>eastern</a> schools to teach in the newly organized <a>professional colleges</a> while also producing groundbreaking research in agricultural sciences.
The &quot;Nebraska method&quot; of ecological study developed here during this time, which pioneered grassland ecology and laid the foundation for research in theoretical ecology for the rest of the 20th century.
Nebraska was recognized nationally as a preeminent regional institution in 1908, when it was inducted as the 18th member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.
The university has since been organized into nine colleges, located on two campuses in Lincoln with over 100 classroom buildings and research facilities.</p>
<p>UNL's varsity teams, called the <a>Cornhuskers</a> or Huskers, currently compete in the <a>Big 12 Conference</a> of the <a>NCAA</a> Division l, but will move to the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> for the 2011-2012 season.
The women's volleyball team is also prolific, having won three <a>national championships</a> along with eight other appearances in the <a>Final Four</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Nebraska was created by an act of the Nebraska State Legislature in 1869, two years after <a>Nebraska</a> reached statehood.
The school was given a mission to &quot;afford to the inhabitants of the state the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, science, and the arts.&quot;
The school received an initial land grant of about  and the campus construction began with the building of University Hall in its first year.
By 1873, the University of Nebraska had offered its first two degrees to its first graduating class.
The school remained small and suffered from a lack of funds until about 20 years after its founding, when its high school programs were taken over by a new state education system.
From 1890 to 1895 enrollment rose from 384 to about 1,500.
A law school and a graduate school were also created at about this time period, making it the first school west of the Mississippi to establish a graduate school.
By 1897, the school was 15th in the nation in total enrollment.</p>
<p>Through the turn of the century, the school struggled to find an identity as both a pragmatic, frontier establishment and an academic, intellectual institution.
It also developed a competitive spirit in the form of a debate team, a football team (first called the Cornhuskers in 1901), and the arrival of fraternities and sororities.
In 1913-14, a fierce debate ensued over whether to keep the University in downtown Lincoln or to move it out of town.
The issue was not resolved until a statewide referendum sided with the downtown plan.
After purchasing property downtown, the school experienced a building boom, both on the new property and on the farming campus.
The school would not experience another boom until the late 1940s, when the sudden arrival of thousands of soldiers returning from the war for an education forced the school to seek further expansion.</p>
