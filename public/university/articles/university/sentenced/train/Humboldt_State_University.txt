<p> </p>
<p><strong>Humboldt State University</strong> (HSU) is the northernmost campus of the <a>California State University</a> system, located in <a>Arcata</a> within <a>Humboldt County</a>, <a>California</a>, <a>USA</a>.
The main campus, nestled at the edge of a <a>coast redwood</a> forest, is situated on Preston hill overlooking Arcata and with commanding views of <a>Humboldt Bay</a> and the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>.
Its location eight miles (13&nbsp;km) north of <a>Eureka</a> and  north of <a>San Francisco</a> on the <a>North Coast</a> of <a>California</a> is notable for its natural beauty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Humboldt State Normal School was established as a <a>teacher's college</a> on June 16, 1913, by then-<a>California Governor</a> <a>Hiram Johnson</a>.
The cities of <a>Arcata</a> and <a>Eureka</a> competed with one another to host the new campus.
It opened on April 6, 1914 in the former Arcata Grammar School building with 78 students and 5 faculty.
The school was put under the jurisdiction of the <a>California Department of Education</a>, renamed Humboldt State Teacher's College and Junior College, and moved to its current location in 1921.
In 1924, the Associated Students and the Alumni Association were organized and <em>The Foghorn</em>, the first student newspaper, was published.
<a>Bachelor's degrees</a> began being offered in 1927.
The school was renamed Humboldt State College in 1935 and the next year the <a>Lumberjack</a> was adopted as its mascot.
In 1937, the students opened a cooperative bookstore and soda fountain, which would exist for the next 40 years as the center of student life.</p>
<p><a>thumb|240px|left|Founder's Hall is the most prominent building on campus and is featured on the university's seal.
It is also the oldest building on campus, constructed in 1921.</a>During
<a>World War II</a>, Founder's Hall, which is visible from <a>Humboldt Bay</a>, was painted <a>camouflage</a> so <a>Japanese submarines</a> would not use it as a navigational aid.
An air observation post was also set up atop the art shop to watch for Japanese air strikes.
The observation post was primarily staffed by wives of faculty members.
The post was removed in 1953.</p>
<p><a>Graduate programs</a> began being offered in 1947.
The same year, KHSC, the first state college radio station in California, was established (later to become <a>KHSU</a>).
In 1960, the college joined the newly-formed California State College system.
The junior college program, terminated at HSU in 1962, was re-established in 1964 at <a>College of the Redwoods</a> (CR) south of <a>Eureka</a>.
Located only seventeen miles south of HSU, both institutions maintain a close working relationship, with many students transferring to HSU following graduation from CR.</p>
<p>Student activism on campus rose through the 1960s and early 1970s, peaking in a protest against the <a>Vietnam War</a> with about 800 students (out of 3,600) participating on October 15, 1969.
This was followed by another protest with nearly 3,000 students who planned a strike after the <a>Cambodian Incursion</a>.
With similar events across the state, Governor <a>Reagan</a> shut down the CSC system in May 1970 for the rest of the year.
The 1970s also saw the rise of <a>feminist</a>, cultural, and <a>LGBT</a> groups, and though the Women's Center would be the only one to survive through the 1980s, most groups would reappear by the mid 1990s.
The campus currently hosts a <a>United Students Against Sweatshops</a> group that is active in lobbying for ethical products and services on campus.</p>
<p>In 1967, the <a>Humboldt Film Festival</a> started and it is now the oldest surviving student-run festival in the world.</p>
<p>In 1972, the college was renamed California State University, Humboldt, and was further renamed Humboldt State University two years later.
Enrollment first reached 7,500 in 1974, a level at which it has remained.
Through the 1980s, <a>mature students</a> became a large part of Humboldt State's student body, and in 1986 40% of the students were over the age of 25.
The number has since decreased to 30%.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Creekview Apartments.</a></p>
<p>The university is divided into three colleges: the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; the College of Natural Resources and Sciences; and the College of Professional Studies.
There are 49 undergraduate majors and 85 minors.
The two largest majors are <a>Biology</a> and <a>Art</a>, both with over 20 faculty members and extensive facilities on- and off-campus.
There are several credential programs and twelve <a>Master's programs</a>, of which <a>Natural Resources</a> and <a>Social Work</a> are the largest.
The new Energy, Environment, and Society graduate program is unique to the CSU, and provides graduates with interdisciplinary training in engineering, economics, and climate policy.</p>
<p>Humboldt State is one of only two universities in California to offer a major in <a>Botany</a>, the other being <a>Cal Poly Pomona</a>.
Its botany program is the nation&#x2019;s largest undergraduate program.
Humboldt State is the only university in California to offer a degree in Rangeland Resources and Wildland Soils.
The <a>Native American Studies</a> major and the <a>Oceanography</a> major are also unique to the California State University system.
The university offers unique minors including Multicultural Queer Studies, <a>Scientific Diving</a>, and <a>Appropriate Technology</a>.
The university's location on the <a>North Coast</a> provides access to the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>, lagoons, marshes, estuaries, and the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory, which provides opportunities for &quot;hands-on&quot; experiences and research for the sciences.</p>
<p>Humboldt State University is one of the few universities in the nation with a state-of-the-art fire lab.
Its fire science program teaches modern techniques for managing wildfire, and an advanced training program is offered for Forest Service employees and similar professionals.</p>
<p>Humboldt State University has an International student population that has quadrupled in the last five years.
The International English Language Institute has worked alongside HSU for 22 years to help international students gain academic English language skills to further their academic pursuits and business careers.
</p>
<p>The Office of Extended Education (OEE) is a self-supporting outreach department of Humboldt State University that provides a variety of academic, professional development and personal enrichment opportunities.
While OEE programs are open to most everyone, there is an emphasis on providing access to those community members who are not matriculated students at the university.
Non-matriculated students may take some regular university courses through the OEE Open University program.
High school students may take regular HSU courses through the OEE High School Concurrent Enrollment Program.
Also, those aged 60 and over may take regular HSU classes through the Over 60 Program.
OEE also offers a wide range of diverse and eclectic programs.
Examples include music and art programs for children, the <a>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute</a> for those aged 50 and over, foreign language classes, travel-study programs, continuing education for teachers, MFT/LCSW, nurses, and law enforcement, to name a few.</p>
<p>In 1998 Humboldt State University opened the HSU First Street Gallery in Old Town Eureka, expanding community access to the university&#x2019;s cultural and fine arts programs.
In 2007, the university further expanded its presence in Eureka with the opening of the HSU Humboldt Bay Aquatic Center, a $4.5 million aquatic facility on the bay in <a>Old Town Eureka</a>.
Future plans include a new HSU Bay and Estuarine Studies Center.
This new facility will be closer to the <em>Coral Sea</em> (now docked at <a>Woodley Island, Eureka</a>), which is the only vessel in a US educational institution solely dedicated to undergraduate research.
The new facility would be considerably larger than the other existing facility, the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory in Trinidad, twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) north.</p>
<p>Humboldt State University Professor Steve Sillett has conducted groundbreaking research on <a>redwood</a> forest canopies and was featured in a 2009 cover story in <a>National Geographic</a>.
He holds the Kenneth L. Fisher Chair in Redwood Forest Ecology, the only endowed chair in the world dedicated to a single tree species.</li>

  <li><strong>Colleges With a Conscience.</strong>
HSU is one of the colleges profiled in The Princeton Review's book, <em>Colleges with a Conscience: 81 Great Schools with Outstanding Community Involvement</em>.
The school was selected because of its record of having excellent service-learning programs and its blending of academics with community work.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First Tier of Western Universities (Top 15)</strong>.
In a Saludos Hispanos survey, the university merited this multicultural listing because approximately 8% of the student body is Hispanic (only schools with at least 7% Hispanic students qualified).
Factors that led to placement as number 9 of the top 15 schools in the West included reasonable tuition, both in and out of state, and the fact that HSU students record the highest passing scores among the 23-campus CSU system on the <a>CBEST</a> (the California Basic Educational Skills Test).
The <a>CBEST</a> measures reading, mathematics skills and expository writing and is required of new teachers, administrators, counselors, psychologists and librarians.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 Counterculture Colleges.</strong>
The <a>High Times</a> magazine placed HSU in the number eight slot for 2008.
The magazine ranks the nation&#x2019;s institutions of higher education from the cannabis community&#x2019;s point of view.
This year the guide placed an emphasis on campus activism and academic excellence.
Editors of the magazine wrote, &quot;Humboldt is consistently cited as being in the &quot;Top 10%&quot; of all US colleges and universities for academic quality.&quot;

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- NOTE: The census does not count students the way people might think.
This means the population of Arcata may actually swell by at least several thousand during regular terms.
Arcata may actually exceed 20,000 persons in late August or September, especially before students start dropping.
--&gt; <a>thumb|350px|right|Jolly Giant Commons at Humboldt State University.</a>
Humboldt State's student population has stayed consistently around 7,500 for several decades.
This is equal to approximately half of the population of Arcata, though students are dispersed all over the region.
Eighteen percent of students live in the <a>residence halls</a>, usually new freshmen and transfer students.
The university's student body's average age is 26, one of the highest in the country.</p>
<p>Humboldt State is well known for its <a>environmental</a> awareness and <a>activism</a>.
The Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF) is unique to the CSU, and uses student fee monies to fund renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on campus.
HEIF provides a rare opportunity for students, faculty, and plant operations staff to work together collaboratively towards a goal of a lower-carbon and energy-independent future.
<a>Compost</a> and <a>recycling</a> bins are more common on campus than trash cans and many events are encouraged to be <a>zero waste</a>.
The Associated Students fund the Campus Recycling Program, the <a>Campus Center for Appropriate Technology</a>, and the <a>Sustainable Living</a> Arts and Music Festival (SLAM fest).</p>
<p>Humboldt State University built the first building in the CSU system to be LEED-gold certified for its eco-friendly features.
The Behavioral and Social Sciences Building has rainwater collection, sustainably harvested wood native-plant landscaping, and more.</p>
<p>KRFH.NET 610 AM is a student-run <a>radio station</a> founded in 1990 by Dr. Gary Melton.
KRFH stands for &quot;Radio Free Humboldt&quot; and was originally only received in the Sunset and Redwood Residence Halls.
KRFH's purpose is to provide broadcast experience to students while also approximating the structure of a commercial radio station.
Students enroll in JMC 155 or JMC 355 in order to become <a>DJs</a>, committing to weekly shows of one to two hours respectively.</p>

<h3>Marching Lumberjacks</h3>
<p> The HSU Marching Lumberjacks (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Banned&quot;) is the official student-run <a>marching band</a> of the university.
It performs in the <a>scatter band</a> style often associated with <a>ivy league</a> schools, using humorous routines and scripts during its half-time field shows in Redwood Bowl.</p>
<h3>Intercollegiate athletics</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Lumberjacks&#x2019; program is affiliated with the <a>NCAA</a> on the <a>Division II</a> level and is a member of the <a>California Collegiate Athletic Association</a>.
Humboldt State currently sponsors 12 <a>intercollegiate sports programs</a> &#x2014; men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s <a>soccer</a>, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s <a>cross country</a>, Cheerleading, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>football</a>, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s <a>basketball</a>, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s <a>track and field</a>, <a>softball</a> and women&#x2019;s <a>rowing</a>.
Their football team lost 74-0 to Boise State during their first home opener on their <a>blue turf</a>.
</p>
<p>Recently the men&#x2019;s basketball achieved its first-ever West Region title and advancement to the semifinals of the NCAA Division II for the first time in the program&#x2019;s 81-year history.
HSU's softball team has qualified for the NCAA post-season 18 times between 1990 and 2008, capturing the national championship in 1999 and in 2008.
The women&#x2019;s rowing program advanced both its Varsity 4 and Varsity 8 boats to the NCAA Championships in 2004, with the Varsity 4 earning the individual boat national title and the Varsity 8 placing second at nationals.
Also, the Lumberjacks have produced national champions and <a>All-Americans</a> in cross country and track and field.
In 1980, the school&#x2019;s first year in Division II, the HSU men&#x2019;s cross country team claimed a national title.
A year later, cross country runner Mark Conover earned the individual crown and later represented the USA as a <a>marathoner</a> in the <a>1988 Summer Olympic Games</a>.</p>
