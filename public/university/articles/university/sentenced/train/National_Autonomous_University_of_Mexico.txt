<p>The <strong>National Autonomous University of Mexico</strong> () (<strong>UNAM</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> based primarily in <a>Mexico City</a> and is generally considered to have the largest enrollment among universities in the Americas.
as a liberal alternative to the <a>Roman Catholic</a>-sponsored <a>Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico</a> (founded on 21 September 1551 by a royal decree of <a>Charles I of Spain</a> and brought to a definitive closure in 1867 by the liberals).
UNAM's autonomy, granted in the 1920s, has given it the freedom to define its own curriculum and manage its own budget without interference from the government.
This has had a profound effect on academic life at the university, which some claim boosts academic freedom and independence.</p>
<p>The UNAM generates a number of different publications in diverse areas, such as mathematics, physics and history.
It is also the only university in Mexico with <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates among its alumni: <a>Alfonso Garc&#x00ed;a Robles</a> (<a>Peace</a>), <a>Octavio Paz</a> (<a>Literature</a>), and <a>Mario Molina</a> (<a>Chemistry</a>).</p>
<p>Besides being one of the most recognized universities in Latin America, it is one of the largest and the most artistically detailed.
Its main campus is a <a>World Heritage</a> site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the 20th century.
Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as <a>Diego Rivera</a> and <a>David Alfaro Siqueiros</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Justo Sierra.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Justo
Sierra]], founder.]]
The university was founded on 22 September 1910 by <a>Justo Sierra</a>, and brought to a definitive closure in 1867 by <a>Benito Ju&#x00e1;rez</a> and his fellow <a>Liberals</a>.
he aimed to create a new university, secular in nature and national in scope, that could reorganize higher education within the country, serve as a model of <a>positivism</a> and encompass the ideas of the dominant Mexican liberalism.</p>
<p>The project initially unified the Fine Arts, Business, Political Science, Jurisprudence, Engineering, Medicine, <a>Normal</a> and the <a>National Preparatory</a> schools; its first <a>rector</a> was <a>Joaquin Egu&#x00ed;a y Lis</a>.
</p>
<p>The new university's challenges were mostly political, due to the ongoing <a>Mexican Revolution</a> and the fact that the federal government had direct control over the university's policies and curriculum; some resisted its establishment on philosophical grounds.
This opposition led to disruptions in the function of the university when political instability forced resignations in the government, including that of President D&#x00ed;az.
Internally, the first student strike occurred in 1912 to protest examination methods introduced by the director of the School of Jurisprudence, <a>Luis Cabrera</a>.
By July of that year, a majority of the law students decided to abandon the university and join the newly-created <a>Free School of Law</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:PalacioUNAMAutonomiaDF.JPG|right|thumb|<em>Palacio de la Autonom&#x00ed;a</em>, located off Moneda Street east of the [[Zocalo]].]]
In 1943, initial decisions were made to move the university from the various buildings it occupied in the city center to a new and consolidated university campus; the new <em><a>Ciudad Universitaria</a></em>  (lit.
University City) would be in <a>San &#x00c1;ngel</a>, to the south of the city.
The first stone laid was that of the <a>faculty</a> of Sciences, the first building of Ciudad Universitaria.
President <a>Miguel Alem&#x00e1;n Vald&#x00e9;s</a> participated in the ceremony on 20 November 1952.
The <a>University Olympic Stadium</a> was inaugurated on the same day.
In 1957, the Doctorate Council was created to regulate and organize graduate studies.</p>
<p>Another major student strike, again over examination regulations, occurred in 1966.
Students invaded the <a>rectorate</a> and forced the rector to resign.
The Board of Regents did not accept this resignation, so the professors went on strike, paralyzing the university and forcing the Board's acceptance.
In the summer, violent outbreaks occurred on a number of the campuses of the University-affiliated preparatory schools; police took over a number of high school campuses, with injuries.
During August 1968, protests formed on the main campus against the police actions on the main campus and in the center of the city.
The protests grew into a student movement that demanded the resignation of the police chief, among other things.
More protests followed in September, gaining frequency and numbers.
During a meeting of the student leaders, the army fired on the Chihuahua building in <a>Tlatelolco</a>, where the student organization supposedly was.
They also fired on the crowd that was outside, with many dead, wounded and detained.
Protests continued after that.
Only ten days later, the <a>1968 Olympic Games</a> opened at the University Stadium.
The University was shut down for the duration.
Finally, some progress was made toward restoring order.</p>
<p>The 1970s and 1980s saw the opening of satellite campuses in other parts of Mexico and nearby areas, to decentralize the system.
There were some minor student strikes, mostly concerning grading and tuition.
The <a>last major student strike</a> at the university occurred in 1999&#x2013;2000 when students shut down the campus for almost a year to protest a proposal to charge students the equivalent of <a>US$</a>150 per semester for those who could afford it.
Referendums were held by both the university and the strikers, but neither side accepted the others' results.
Acting on a judge's order, the police stormed the buildings held by strikers on 7 February 2000, putting an end to the strike.</p>
<p>In 2009, the university was awarded the <a>Prince of Asturias Award</a> for Communication and Humanities and began the celebration of its centennial anniversary with several activities that will last until 2011.</p>

<h3>University City</h3>
<p> </em>[[Image:UNAM Ciudad Universitaria.jpg|right|thumb|275px|<em>The main campus in [[Mexico City]].]]
&quot;Ciudad Universitaria&quot; (University City) is UNAM's main campus, located within the <a>Coyoac&#x00e1;n</a> borough in the southern part of Mexico City.
It was designed by architects <a>Mario Pani</a>, <a>Enrique del Moral</a>, <a>Domingo Garc&#x00ed;a Ramos</a>, <a>Armando Franco Rovira</a> and others, and it encloses the <a>Estadio Ol&#x00ed;mpico Universitario</a>, about 40 faculties and institutes, the Cultural Center, an ecological reserve, the <a>Central Library</a>, and a few museums.
It was built during the 1950s on an ancient solidified lava bed to replace the scattered buildings in downtown <a>Mexico City</a>, where classes were given.
It was completed in 1954, and is almost a separate region within Mexico City, with its own regulations, councils, and police (to some extent), in a more fundamental way than most universities around the world.
</p>
<p>In June 2007, its main campus, <a>Ciudad Universitaria</a>, was declared a <a>UNESCO</a> <a>World Heritage Site</a>.</p>
<h3>Satellite campi</h3>
<p>Apart from Ciudad Universitaria, UNAM has several campi in the <a>Metropolitan Area of Mexico City</a> (Acatl&#x00e1;n, Arag&#x00f3;n, Cuautitl&#x00e1;n, Iztacala, and Zaragoza), as well as many others in several locations across Mexico (in <a>Santiago de Quer&#x00e9;taro</a>, <a>Morelia</a>, <a>M&#x00e9;rida</a>, <a>Ensenada</a>, and <a>Cuernavaca</a>), mainly aimed at research and graduate studies.
It has also four small foreign campuses in the United States and Canada, focusing on the <a>Spanish language</a> and Mexican culture: <a>UNAM San Antonio, Texas</a>; <a>Chicago</a>, <a>Illinois</a>; <a>Los Angeles</a>, <a>California</a>; <a>Gatineau, Quebec</a>.</p>
<h3>External buildings of interest</h3>
<h4>Palacio de Miner&#x00ed;a</h4>
<p>[[Image:ColegioMineriaDF.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Colegio de Miner&#x00ed;a (College of Mining) building on Tacuba street in the [[Centro (Mexico City)|historic center]] of Mexico City.]]
Under the care of UNAM's Engineering Faculty, the Colonial Palace of Mining is located in the historical center of Mexico City.
Formerly the School of Engineering, it has three floors, and hosts the International Book Expo (&quot;Feria Internacional del Libro&quot; or &quot;FIL&quot;) and the International Day of Computing Security Congress (&quot;DISC&quot;).
It also has a permanent exhibition of historical books, mostly topographical and naturalist works of 19th century Mexican scientists, in the former library of the School of Engineers.
It also contains several exhibitions related to mining, the prime engineering occupation during the Spanish colonization.
It is considered to be one of the most significant examples of Mexican architecture of its period.</p>
<h4>Casa del Lago</h4>
<p>The House of the Lake, in <a>Chapultepec Park</a>, is a place devoted to cultural activities, including dancing, theatre plays and ballet.
It also serves as meeting place for university-related organizations and committees.</p>
<h4>Museum of San Ildefonso</h4>
<p> This museum and cultural center is considered to be the birthplace of the <a>Mexican muralism</a> movement.
San Ildefonso began as a prestigious <a>Jesuit</a> boarding school, and after the <a>Reform War</a>, it gained educational prestige again as <a>National Preparatory School</a>, which was closely linked to the founding of UNAM.
This school, and the building, closed completely in 1978, then reopened as a museum and cultural center in 1994, administered jointly by UNAM, the National Council for Culture and Arts and the government of the Federal District of Mexico City.
The museum has permanent and temporary art and archaeological exhibitions, in addition to the many murals painted on its walls by <a>Jose Clemente Orozco</a>, <a>Diego Rivera</a> and others.
The complex is located between San Ildefonso Street and Justo Sierra Street in the <a>historic center</a> of <a>Mexico City</a> .
It served the National Museum of Natural History for almost 50 years, and is now devoted to the temporary exhibitions of visual arts.</p>
<h4>National Astronomical Observatory</h4>
<p> The National Astronomical Observatory is located in the <a>Sierra San Pedro M&#x00e1;rtir</a> mountain range in <a>Baja California</a>, about 130&nbsp;km south of <a>United States-Mexican border</a>.
It has been in operation since 1970, and it currently has three large reflecting telescopes.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>[[Image:Torre de Rector&#x00ed;a.jpg|right|thumb|250
px|The [[Rectorate]] tower.]]
UNAM is organized in <a>faculties</a>, rather than <a>departments</a>.
Both <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> studies are available.
UNAM is also responsible for the <a>Escuela Nacional Preparatoria</a> (ENP) <a>(National Preparatory School)</a>, and the <a>Colegio de Ciencias y Humanidades</a> (CCH) <a>(Science and Humanities College)</a>, which consist of several <a>high school</a>s, in <a>Mexico City</a>.
Counting ENEP, CCH, FES <a>(Facultad de Estudios Profesionales)</a> undergraduate and graduate students, UNAM has over 314,557  students, making it one of the <a>world's largest universities</a>.</p>
