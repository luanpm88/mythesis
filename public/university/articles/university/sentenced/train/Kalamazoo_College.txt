<p>Kalamazoo College is a member of the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>.
It is listed in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.
In 2010, <a>Forbes</a> rated it 73rd of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>., the highest ranked in the State of Michigan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Brown Hall and dormitory in 1906</a></p>
<p>Kalamazoo College was founded in 1833 by a group of Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute.
Its charter was granted on April 22, 1833, the first school chartered by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Michigan.
Instruction at the Institute began in fall 1836.
In 1837, the name of the fledgling college was changed to the &quot;Kalamazoo Literary Institute&quot; and school officials made their first attempt to secure recognition as a college from the state of <a>Michigan</a>.
In 1838, however, the <a>University of Michigan</a> opened the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan, providing a local competitor to the Literary Institute.
In 1840, the two schools merged, and from 1840 to 1850 the College operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan.
In 1850, the Kalamazoo Literary Institute name was restored and in 1855 the school finally received an educational charter from the State of Michigan, establishing explicit recognition of the school as a college.
After receiving its educational charter, the school changed its name to Kalamazoo College.</p>
<p>James Stone, the first president of Kalamazoo College, led the school from 1842 through 1863 and was responsible for instituting the high academic standards that allowed the College to receive its charter.
Shortly after becoming president, Stone proposed the addition of a theological seminary to increase the supply of ministers in the region.
With the support of the Baptist church, classes at the Kalamazoo Theological Seminary began in 1848 with 11 students.
At the same time, the Female Department continued to expand under the watchful eye of Lucinda Hinsdale Stone.</p>
<p>The Stones also played a role in the creation of the <a>Republican Party</a>.
A meeting of disgruntled Michigan <a>Whigs</a>, <a>Democrats</a>, and abolitionists at the Stones' Kalamazoo residence set the date for an anti-slavery convention in <a>Jackson, Michigan</a>, which resulted in the formal birth of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The first known student of African descent to attend Kalamazoo College was ex-slave Rufus Lewis Perry.
Perry attended Kalamazoo Theological Seminary from 1860&#x2013;1861, but left before he received a diploma.
He was ordained a Baptist minister in Ann Arbor in 1861, and later earned a Ph.D. from State University in Louisville, Kentucky.
Jamaican-born brothers Solomon and John Williamson were the first black graduates from &quot;K,&quot; receiving their diplomas in 1911.
Kalamazoo College also served as a pioneer in <a>coed education</a>, granting its first degree to a woman, Miss Catherine V. Eldred, in 1870.</p>
<p>In 1877, Kalamazoo College students published the first edition of <em>The Index</em>, a student-run newspaper that continues to publish today.
The college also publishes &quot;The Cauldron,&quot; an annual literary-arts journal; and  &quot;The Passage&quot;, an annual compilation of students' work from study abroad.</p>
<p>Kalamazoo College's reputation as an academic powerhouse and a leader in international education was built during the presidency of <a>Weimer Hicks</a>, who served from 1954 to 1971.
Among all undergraduate institutions, Kalamazoo College was #1 per capita in 2005 for recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The school's sports teams are called the Hornets.
They compete in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division III and the <a>Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association</a> (MIAA).
As of 2009, the Hornet tennis squad have won their conference's championship 71 consecutive years.

It was 1895 before the school defeated another college football team with a 12&ndash;8 victory over <a>Alma</a>.</p>

<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<h4>Basketball dispute</h4>
<p>In 2001, the Kalamazoo College men's basketball team was at the center of a lengthy dispute regarding the outcome of a January 20 game with league rival <a>Olivet College</a>.
With Olivet leading 70-69, Kalamazoo College center Kevin Baird made a shot at the buzzer that was initially waved off by referees.
The referees reviewed videotape of the game and determined that Baird had, in fact, released his shot before the buzzer and then awarded Kalamazoo College a 71-70 victory.
After the game, Olivet filed a protest with the conference commissioner, claiming that officials had misapplied the way in which videotape may be used.
On January 23, the conference upheld the protest and awarded Olivet the victory.
Kalamazoo then filed a protest with the NCAA, claiming that Olivet's protest was in violation of NCAA bylaws.
On February 1, the NCAA upheld Kalamazoo's counter-protest and again awarded the game to the Hornets.
The dispute between Olivet and Kalamazoo received national attention and Baird's shot was shown repeatedly on <a>ESPN</a>.</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>The words to the college fight-song, &quot;All Hail to Kazoo,&quot; were written by A.G. Walton (1911) with music by D.R. Belcher (1909), arranged by Burton Edward Fischer.</p>
<h2>Student life and traditions</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Hoben Hall taken from Hicks Center</a></p>
<p>Student organizations are one of the main sources of entertainment for the student body.
They routinely bring in speakers as well as stage performances, dances, and movie showings.</p>
<p>During the fall quarter, there are two main events: Fall Fest and <a>Homecoming</a> dance.
In Fall Fest, student organizations provide activities for the students, such as pumpkin carving and bobbing for apples.</p>
<p>During the winter quarter, the college holds the annual Monte Carlo night, on which the student body raises money by gambling in a makeshift casino where the professors are the dealers.
They play for scrip redeemable for prizes.</p>
<h3>Crystal Ball</h3>
<p>Kaleidoscope (formerly known as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Ally Student Organization, GLBTSO) hosts the Crystal Ball each spring.
Crystal Ball is a college-sponsored dance in which attendees dress in drag or unusual costumes.
A long-standing tradition at K College, this event was created to educate the campus about GLBT issues and celebrate the persons who make up the GLBT community.
This very popular event features live music, dancing, and contests.</p>
<h3>Day of Gracious Living</h3>
<p>Since 1974, the college has upheld a springtime tradition of canceling all classes for a &#x201c;Day of Gracious Living&#x201d; (DOGL).
While it was originally instituted (despite the Student Commission's rejection) as a day for students to relax and have fun, the <a>1980 Kalamazoo tornado</a> prompted students to spend that year's DOGL helping clean up after the storm and giving back to their community.
Many students enjoy the day at the North Beach in <a>South Haven</a>, MI.
The date is determined by the president of the Student Commission and kept secret from the student body, though it is usually on one of the Wednesdays during weeks 7-9.
On the morning of the Day of Gracious Living, the bells of <a>Stetson Chapel</a> ring, announcing the day to the student body.</p>
<h3>Recycling program</h3>
<p>Kalamazoo College has become a leading institution in the area of recycling and environmental awareness.
A crew of student workers operates one of the nation's most successful recycling programs and organizes the school's participation in the annual <a>RecycleMania</a> event, a competition among over 400 colleges and universities across the United States.
In 2005, Kalamazoo College came to national prominence with a 3rd-place finish in the Grand Champion category.
While annually placing in the top 5 in a variety of categories, in 2008 Kalamazoo College placed 1st in both the Grand Champion and Stephen K Gaski Per Capita Classic competitions.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Kalamazoo College signed the President's Climate Commitment in 2007 and has completed a greenhouse gas emissions inventory.
The college's Hicks Student Center is partially powered by wind and solar energy, and the student group D.I.R.T. (Digging in Renewable Turf) maintains an organic garden on campus.
The spring 2009 Energy Sting competition encouraged students to reduce their energy consumption.
Kalamazoo received a B on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card.</p>
