<h2>Music</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|College of Saint Benedict; Main Building (right), Sacred Heart Chapel (left) and Main Convent (center).</a>
The music department at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University is quite expansive considering the size of the school.
The department of music has many ensembles including four choirs, an orchestra, a wind ensemble, a jazz ensemble, and several small chamber ensembles.
Many of these ensembles tour extensively both domestically and abroad.
The department also presents an opera every year and recently performed a Stephen Paulus oratorio about the Holocaust entitled &quot;To Be Certain of the Dawn&quot;, jointly with choirs and orchestra from <a>Saint Cloud State University</a> in Europe in May 2008.
There are also several student run groups, including the <a>a cappella</a> group Johnnie Blend.
Over half of the students at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University participate in some kind of music ensemble.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>All student media is run independent of the CSB/SJU administration.</p>
<h3><em>The Record</em></h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Great Hall, on the campus of SJU; it served as the abbey church until the construction of current present church.</a>
The official SJU newspaper since 1888, <em>The Record</em> became the official newspaper of CSB in 2000.
The newspaper is published weekly during the fall and spring semesters and has been recognized among the best weekly college newspapers in Minnesota and the U.S. All back issues of CSB newspapers are available for full-text searching and viewing online through <a>Vivarium</a>, the CSB/SJU Digital Image Collection.</p>
<h3>KJNB</h3>
<p>The official student radio station of CSB/SJU allows students to host talk and music-oriented shows in one-hour segments.
When KJNB first started out in 1954, it was located in the basement of Mary Hall (where Bat Cave is supposedly right now).
When Bat Cave moved in, there are rumors that KJNB supposedly moved to somewhere in the basement of Steven B. Humphrey theater.
Around 2001, the studio was moved to its current location.
The studio is located in the lower level of <a>Guild Hall</a> (also called the Old Gym and Rat Hall) in the center of campus.
The location now (the basement) used to be Rat Hall, filled with dormitories that housed the ROTC students.
The once-occupied dorm rooms were converted into what are now the offices and the studio itself.
Broadcasts are streamed over the <a>Internet</a> and are broadcast on closed-circuit campus TV Channel 6 and in a few public locations across both campuses.
The official broadcasting signal was purchased by a local commercial radio station (possibly Clear Channel), so it could expand its service area, though efforts are underway to regain the signal again someday.
KJNB does not advertise (as it is a non-commercial station) and dead air is filled with randomly cycled music.</p>
