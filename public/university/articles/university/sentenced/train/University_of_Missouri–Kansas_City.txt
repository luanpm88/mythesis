<p>The <strong>University of Missouri&#x2013;Kansas City</strong> (often referred to as <strong>UMKC</strong>) is an institution of higher learning located in <a>Kansas City</a>, <a>Missouri</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Its main campus is in Kansas City's Rockhill neighborhood east of the <a>Country Club Plaza</a>.
The university's enrollment is around 15,000, and is expected to increase by 20% in 2011.
It is a part of the <a>University of Missouri System</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Lincoln and Lee University</h3>
<p>The school has its roots in the <strong>Lincoln and Lee University</strong> movement first put forth by the <a>Methodist Church</a> and its Bishop <a>Ernest Lynn Waldorf</a> in the 1920s.
The proposed university (which was to honor <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a>Robert E. Lee</a>) was to be built on the <a>Missouri</a>-<a>Kansas</a> border at 75th and State Line Road, where the <a>Battle of Westport</a> (the largest battle west of the <a>Mississippi River</a> during the <a>American Civil War</a>) took place.
The centerpiece of the school was to be a <a>National Memorial</a> marking the tomb of an unknown Union soldier and unknown Confederate soldier.
Proponents of the school said it would be a location &quot;where North met South and East met West.&quot;
The Methodist interest reflected the church's important role in the development of the Kansas City area through the <a>Shawnee Methodist Mission</a> which was the second capital of Kansas.</p>
<p>As the Methodists started having problems piecing together the necessary property, other civic leaders including <a>J.C.
Nichols</a> began pushing to create a cultural center on either side of <a>Brush Creek</a>, just east of the <a>Country Club Plaza</a>.
According to this plan the <a>Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art</a> and <a>Kansas City Art Institute</a> would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of <em><a>The Kansas City Star</a></em> publisher <a>William Rockhill Nelson</a> and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a <a>junior college</a>) would be built south of the creek.
In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of <em><a>Kansas City Journal-Post</a></em> publisher <a>Walter S. Dickey</a>.
The hospital was never built.</p>
<p>In 1930, after the Methodists had brought the Kansas City Dental School into their fold, the two plans were merged.
The new school was to be called &quot;<strong>Lincoln and Lee, the University of Kansas City</strong>.&quot;  and plans were underway to develop it into a four-year school.</p>
<p>The university was built on a  plot, southeast of the Nelson mansion.
<a>William Volker</a> had purchased and donated this land for the University of Kansas City.
The original Volker purchase did not include the Dickey mansion itself.
Dickey died unexpectedly in 1931 and Volker acquired it to be the first building.</p>
<h3>University of Kansas City</h3>
<p>:<em>For the defunct school in Kansas City, Kansas, see <a>Kansas City University</a>.</em></p>
<p>The two groups were to squabble back and forth, with <a>Ernest H. Newcomb</a> attempting to mediate.
The Church did not maintain its ties and the Lincoln and Lee name was abandoned.</p>
<p>The school announced that it would start if 125 students enrolled.
Classes began in October 1933 with a faculty of 17 and a student enrollment of 264.</p>
<p>The campus (now expanded to 90 acres) is called the Volker Campus.
The Dickey mansion is now Scofield Hall.
The second building on the campus, the library, was named for Newcomb.
A <a>Carl Milles</a> fountain on Brush Creek opposite the Nelson Gallery is called the Volker Fountain.</p>
<p>The University of Kansas City grew quickly, and soon incorporated other existing local private institutions of higher learning.
The <a>Kansas City School of Law</a>, which was founded in the 1890s and located in <a>downtown Kansas City</a>, merged into the university in 1938.
The Kansas City-Western Dental College followed in 1941 and the Kansas City College of Pharmacy merged in 1943.
This was followed by the Kansas City Conservatory of Music in 1959.
During this period, the university also established the School of Administration in 1953, the School of Education in 1954, and the Division for Continuing Education in 1958.</p>
<h3>University of Missouri-Kansas City</h3>
<p>On July 25, 1963 at the urging of alumnus <a>Hilary A. Bush</a> , the university became part of the <a>University of Missouri System</a> and $20 million of assets including 23 buildings were transferred to the University of Missouri.
At the time of the acquisition the UKC had 3,300 students (2,000 full time) and 175 full time faculty.</p>
<p>At the same time the University of Missouri acquired the Normandy Residence Center in St. Louis to form the <a>University of Missouri-St.
Louis</a>.
The acquisitions of the two schools were different in that the privately-owned University of Kansas City could be donated to Missouri while the University of Missouri had to buy the St. Louis campus (although for a nominal $60,000) because the St. Louis campus had been purchased for a junior college in a bond election by the public <a>Normandy, Missouri</a> School District.</p>
<p>At the time of acquisition Missouri already owned the campuses in <a>Columbia</a> and <a>Rolla</a>.
Accordingly, the university's name was changed to the University of Missouri&#x2013;Kansas City.</p>
<p>After this, UMKC established the School of Graduate Studies in 1964, the School of Medicine in 1970, the School of Nursing in 1980, the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985 (which was renamed the School of Biological Sciences in the mid-1990s), and the School of Computing and Engineering in 2001.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>

<h3>Academic units</h3>
<p>Today, the academic divisions of UMKC are the <a>College of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a>School of Education</a>, the <a>School of Nursing</a>, the <a>Henry W. Bloch School of Business and Public Administration</a>, the <a>School of Medicine</a> (one of six in Missouri), the <a>School of Law</a> (also one of only four in Missouri), the <a>School of Computing and Engineering</a>, the <a>School of Biological Sciences</a>, the <a>Conservatory of Music and Dance</a>, the <a>School of Dentistry</a>, the <a>School of Graduate Studies</a>, and the <a>School of Pharmacy</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine is regionally known for its six-year post-secondary program, wherein a student spends only six years obtaining both a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Doctor of Medicine</a> degree.
The school is located away from the main campus on &quot;Hospital Hill,&quot; where it is connected to Truman Medical Center, a large research <a>hospital</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Law</a> produces more future judges than any other law school in Missouri, according to <a>local business publication</a> <em>Ingram's Magazine</em>.
In addition, graduates of the law school now have one of the highest passage rates on the Missouri <a>bar exam</a>.
The school is one of only seven American law schools, along with <a>Yale Law School</a>, <a>Harvard Law School</a>, <a>Columbia Law School</a>, the <a>University of Virginia School of Law</a>, the <a>William &amp; Mary Law School</a>and the <a>University of Cincinnati College of Law</a>, to have produced both a <a>President of the United States</a> (<a>Harry S. Truman</a>) and a Justice of the <a>Supreme Court of the United States</a> (<a>Charles Evans Whittaker</a>).</p>
<h3>Other Departments</h3>
<p>The University is the home of <a>New Letters</a>, a preeminent <a>literary magazine</a>, as well as the nationally syndicated public radio program  <em>New Letters on the Air</em>.
For over 50 years, UMKC has broadcast live, taped and syndicated programming over <a>KCUR</a>, the university's radio station and NPR affiliate.</p>
<p>In 2004 the <a>Fungal Genetics Stock Center</a> moved to UMKC where it is in the School of Biological Sciences.
The FGSC was founded in 1960 and distributes research materials to over 45 countries.
It is part of several <a>genome</a> programs and publishes the peer-reviewed journal, the  Fungal Genetics Newsletter</p>
<p>The University's MFA Theater program is considered to be one of the better MFA programs in the country.</p>
<p>The University is the site where the <a>Supplemental Instruction</a>program was established and developed .</p>

Originally built as a private residence, Epperson House contained 48 rooms, six bathrooms, elevators, a swimming pool, and a billiard room, spread throughout it four floors.
The residence was built by Uriah S. Epperson, who was a banker, industrialist, and philanthropist who amassed significant wealth from insurance and meat-packing industries.
The building was donated to the university in 1942 for use as a men's dormitory until 1956.
Epperson currently houses the Department of Architecture, Urban Planning and Design.
The building is well known for its apparent hauntings, which earned it a spot on <a>Unsolved Mysteries</a> as one of the top five haunted houses in the United States.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h3>James C. Olson Center for the Performing Arts</h3>
<p>Known on campus simply as the P.A.C. (Performing Arts Center), this building partially houses both the Conservatory of Music and Dance, the Department of Theatre, as well as the <a>Kansas City Repertory Theatre</a>.

<h3>Student Housing</h3>
<h4>Cherry Hall</h4>
<p>Begun in 1955, <strong>Cherry Street Hall</strong>, located at 5030 Cherry Street, was a more traditional-style dormitory on the UMKC Volker campus.
It housed approximately 300 students in 168 single, double and triple rooms with each floor being separated by gender and sharing a communal bathroom.
Cherry Street Hall was often regarded by students as having better opportunities for social interaction than Oak Street.
In August 2009 Cherry Street Hall was closed as a student residence.</p>
<h4>Twin Oaks Apartments</h4>
<p>Formerly located at 5000 Oak Street, <strong>Twin Oaks Apartments</strong> was acquired by the University in 1998 to house students who desired more independent living than the dormitory could provide.
In the years since, however, the buildings had begun to show their ages.
In 2002, the University decided it would be more cost-effective to demolish Twin Oaks and build a new residence hall in its place.
UMKC stopped offering new contracts to prospective residents in 2005, but allowed current residents an additional year as a grace period to find other arrangements.
The buildings were completely vacant by July 2006.
In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department used Twin Oaks to train firefighters.
Demolition by wrecking ball began in November 2006 and was completed in early 2007.</p>
<h4>Oak Street Hall</h4>
<p>Completed in 2004, <strong>Oak Street Hall</strong> is located at 5051 Oak Street.
The five-story building houses approximately 559 students in suite-style single and double rooms.
The ground level is a large common lobby with a kitchen, laundry facility, music practice rooms, pool tables and a widescreen television set.
On floors 2-5, <a>kitchenette</a>s, vending machines, quiet study rooms and social lounges comprise the common areas.
At the time of its completion in 2004 Oak Hall was set as a standard for buildings to come in the 30 year Master Plan set forth by UMKC.</p>
<h4>Oak Place Apartments</h4>
<p>The <strong>Oak Place Apartments</strong> are located at 5050 Oak Street on land once occupied by the Twin Oaks Apartments.
After demolition of the Twin Oaks construction on Oak Place was started in 2007 and Oak Place was opened to students in August 2008.
Oak Place consists of two four story apartment complexes separated by an above ground parking structure.
Oak Place houses around 500 students in 1, 2, and 4 bedroom suite style apartments complete with kitchen.
Common areas include a fitness center, lounge areas, and 3 computer labs in each building.</p>
<h4>Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall</h4>
<p><strong>Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall</strong> is the newest residence hall on the UMKC Volker Campus and is located to the immediate north of Oak Place Apartments.
Construction was started in June 2008 and the hall opened in August 2009.
The four story hall houses up to 328 students in a more traditional dormitory style with suites of single and double occupancy rooms that share a common bathroom.
Each floor of Johnson Hall has separate wings for male and female students.
