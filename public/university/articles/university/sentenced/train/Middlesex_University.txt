<p> </p>
<p><strong>Middlesex University</strong> (<a>abbr.</a>
<strong><em>MU</em></strong>, <strong><em>MDX</em></strong>) is a <a>university</a> in north <a>London</a>, <a>England</a>.
It is located in the <a>historic county boundaries</a> of <a>Middlesex</a> from which it takes its name.
It is one of the so-called <a><em>post-1992</em> universities</a> and is a member of <a>Million+</a> working group.
As is the case with many <a>former polytechnics</a>, Middlesex was formally organised as a teaching institution relatively recently (in 1973), yet can trace its history back to 19th century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Middlesex University essentially grew out of merger between different schools and colleges in <a>North London</a>.
Perhaps the most prominent and one of the oldest of its constituent establishments is the <a>Hornsey College of Art</a>, founded in 1882.
Other institutions include Ponders End Technical Institute (founded in 1901) and Hendon Technical Institute (founded in 1939).
All three institutions were successfully amalgamated to form Middlesex Polytechnic in January 1973.
Before <a>becoming a university in 1992</a>, Middlesex expanded further by joining three more colleges in north London.
While continuing to grow through mergers with other <a>educational institutions</a> in the 1990s, the University has also began developing its international presence, by opening its regional offices in <a>continental Europe</a>.
As of May 2009, it has been operating 15 such offices across the globe.
Since 2000, the university launched a major <a>restructuring</a> programme, which, specifically, translated into a total <a>image rebrand</a> in 2003, the closure of <a>a number of campuses</a> over 2005-2008, the expansion of <a>other campuses</a> and generally the consolidation of the university's activities on fewer, bigger campuses in north London.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The University is spread across four sites: Hendon, Archway, Cat Hill and Trent Park.
Together they form three campuses, (Cat Hill and Trent Park are incorporated into one campus because of close proximity to each other).
All campuses are located in North London and each specializes in a specific area of study.
Each campus has quite a distinct character and some of the campuses are important architecturally, especially Trent Park.
Over the past five years the University has been consolidating many of its activities onto the Hendon campus.
As a result, some older campuses - notably Tottenham and Enfield - were closed in 2005 and 2008 respectively, while Hendon received substantial investment in facilities and infrastructure to accommodate new students and programmes.</p>
<p>Since 2004, the University has also been operating an overseas campus in Dubai and opened another one in Mauritius in October 2009.</p>
<h3>UK campuses</h3>
<h4>Hendon</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|The College building at Hendon</a> Hendon is the university's busiest and most popular campus.
It is set in a prime location of <a>North West London</a>, a short walk from <a>Hendon Central</a> Tube station.</p>
<p>In 2011 the University will open a new building for art and design courses, featuring dedicated workshops and classrooms as well as exhibition areas.</p>
<p><strong>Subject focus:</strong> Business &#x2013; accounting and finance, economics, human resource management, law and marketing; Computing &#x2013; business information systems, computer networking and computer communications; Health and social sciences &#x2013; criminology, politics, psychology, social work, sociology, world development studies, and complementary health.
Also biomedical and biological sciences, nursing, sport sciences, public health and risk management.</p>
<h4>Trent Park</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Mansion at Trent Park</a> </p>
<p>Trent Park campus is set within a  <a>country park</a>, which was originally a fourteenth-century hunting ground of <a>Henry IV</a>.
The focus of the campus is a palatial mansion, designed by <a>Sir William Chambers</a> in 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.
After the <a>Second World War</a>, the <a>Ministry of Education</a> used the house as an emergency teacher training centre, which became a residential teacher training college, called Trent Park College of Education in 1951.
In 1974 the college was incorporated into Middlesex Polytechnic.</p>
<p>Around 16% of Middlesex students are based at Trent Park campus.
University&#x2019;s Summer School, which accounts for ca.
2% of Middlesex students, also takes place here.</p>
<p>The University had ambitious plans to redevelop the site, but they were twice rejected by <a>Enfield</a> Council on environmental concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Subject focus:</strong> Dance, drama and performing arts, English language and literature, media, culture and communication, music, theatre arts, languages and translation studies, philosophy, product design, Teaching and education.
It is also  home to the <a>Flood Hazard Research Centre</a>, which moved here when Enfield campus closed in July 2008.</p>
<h4>Cat Hill</h4>
<p>Cat Hill Campus is located in <a>Cockfosters</a>.
It was originally the illustrious Hornsey College of Art, founded in 1880.
In the late 1970s the campus was extended to become the Faculty of Art &amp; Design of the then Middlesex Polytechnic.
Today, art and design, cinematics and electronic arts are located at Cat Hill.
The Cat Hill Campus houses MoDA, the University's <a>Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture</a> and the national <a>Lesbian and Gay Newsmedia Archive</a>.
The campus also houses the <a>Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts</a> (named after <a>John Lansdown</a>), which runs a variety of graduate and undergraduate degrees in interactive media and electronic arts.
Cat Hill campus will close in Summer 2011 and the courses, staff, facilities will be relocated to Hendon Campus new building.</p>
<p><strong>Subject focus:</strong> Art &amp; Design, fashion, textiles, fine art, graphics and media arts.</p>
<h4>Archway and Hospitals</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Royal Free Hospital</a> Archway and Hospitals campus is primarily the domain of the School of Health and Social Sciences.
It operates from four sites (hospitals): <a>Royal Free Hospital</a>, Whittington Hospital (jointly owned with UCL), <a>Chase Farm</a> and <a>North Middlesex</a>.</p>
<p>On January 24, 2007 Middlesex University inaugurated a new Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) Mental Health and Social Work based at Archway campus.
CETL status was bestowed on the Mental Health and Social Work Academic Group at Middlesex University in partnership with the <a>Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health</a> in 2005.
Consequently, the Centre was awarded a capital grant of &#x00a3;1.4 million along with an annual revenue of &#x00a3;350,000 for five years, representing one of the largest ever funding initiatives by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE).
This  funding has therefore enabled the University to establish new teaching facilities at its Archway campus with the aim of creating an academic community of mental health and social work practitioners, students and faculty in one location.</p>
<h3>Overseas campuses</h3>
<h4>Dubai</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Middlesex University campus in Dubai</a></p>
<p>In 2004, Middlesex University opened its campus in Dubai, U.A.E., situated at <a>Dubai Knowledge Village</a>, a free economic zone.
It is a joint venture between Middlesex University and Middlesex Associates, a business consortium in Dubai.
The campus is spread over nearly  and is the first Middlesex campus outside North London.
The first programmes - mostly, in Business Studies - were offered to students from January 2005.</p>
<p>The campus is licensed by Dubai Knowledge and Human Authority (KHDA), and all of its progammes are individually approved by the KHDA.
In August 2009 KHDA&#x2019;s University Quality Assurance International Board (UQAIB) commended quality of university's programmes.</p>
<p>Currently Middlesex University Dubai offers 17 undergraduate and 3 postgraduate programmes, as well as pre-undergraduate studies.
All four of University's schools (Arts and Education, Business School, Engineering and Information Sciences and Health and Social Sciences) offer courses in Dubai campus.
All degrees are issued by Middlesex University, UK.
In 2008 Middlesex University Dubai awarded its first <a>honorary doctorate</a> to <a>His Excellency Sultan Bin Sulayem</a>.
The number of graduates has grown from just 8 in 2006 to over 200 in 2009, while the alumni network has exceeded 1,000 in 2010.
In 2010 the campus expanded its facilities to include Block 17, which will house a state-of-the-art lecture theatre, several new classrooms and faculty offices as well as the first dedicated postgraduate study suite.</p>
<h4>Mauritius</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Middlesex University Mauritius Branch Campus</a> Located in <a>Bonne Terre</a>, a suburb of <a>Vacoas-Phoenix</a>, the 7,800 sq metre campus officially opened in October 2009.
It features a Learning Resource Centre, open access and specialist computer suites, and dining and social spaces as well as on-site accommodation for up to 190 students.
Lecturing academics based at the Mauritius campus will work in partnership with the academic programme team based at Middlesex&#x2019;s London campuses to ensure the quality standards of the UK programmes are maintained in curriculum delivery, teaching styles and assessment.</p>
<h3>Former campuses</h3>
<h4>Tottenham</h4>
<p>The campus was closed in summer 2005, its programmes of study having moved to the university's other campuses.
What was the Tottenham campus started life as St Katharine's College, one of the first British teacher training colleges in 1878, later to become the College of All Saints, a Church of England college of higher education and a constituent college of the <a>Institute of Education</a>, <a>University of London</a>, for whose degrees it taught.
The name change was a result of the 1964 union of St Katharine's with Berridge House, <a>Hampstead</a>, on the Tottenham site.
The college expanded in the 1960s, although much of the campus retained its Victorian architecture.
After the closer of the college and the union with Middlesex Polytechnic, the 'All Saints' campus was home to humanities and cultural studies, business studies, law, sociology and women's studies, all of which have been moved to other campuses.
The buildings, previously occupied by Middlesex University, were eventually demolished and the site is now the home of the newly built Haringey Sixth Form Centre.
The College of All Saints Foundation continues as the All Saints Educational Trust.</p>
<h4>Bounds Green</h4>
<p>Bounds Green campus, home to the Engineering and Information Technology schools was sold to a residential developer in December 2003.
It was used extensively for location shooting for the 1989 film, <em><a>Wilt</a></em>.</p>
<h4>Enfield</h4>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Broadbent building</a> The history of Enfield Campus began with the history of <a>electric light</a>.
In 1901, <a>Joseph Wilson Swan</a> bought a house in <a>Ponders End</a> High Street that became the <em>Ediswan Institute</em>.
Four years later <em>Ediswan Institute</em> was bought by Middlesex County Council and became the <em>Ponders End Technical Institute</em>.
By 1937 The <em>Ponders End Technical Institute</em> was growing so rapidly that it was decided to build a new college across the road, in Queensway.
Due to the second world war, it was not completed until 1953, but the unfinished buildings were in use throughout the war.
By now it was called <em>Enfield Technical College</em>, but in 1962 it was renamed <em>Enfield College of Technology</em> by the <a>Ministry of Education</a>.
In 1973 the college formed part of Middlesex Polytechnic.
</p>
<p>There are four major building on campus: <em>Broadbent</em>, <em>Roberts building</em> (or Tower Block), <em>McCrae</em> and <em>Pascal</em>.
They are named after people who helped to create it.&lt;br
/&gt; <strong>BROADBENT</strong>: The main building of Enfield Campus is named after Henry Winterbottom Broadbent, a Mechanical Engineer who was appointed first Principal of <em>Enfield Technical College</em> in January 1941.&lt;br
/&gt; <strong>ROBERTS BUILDING</strong>: The Tower Block was named after a local industrialist George A. Roberts, who was chair of Enfield College's Governing Body from 1949 to 1968.&lt;br /&gt; <strong>MCCRAE</strong>: The McCrae Building was the first extension to <em>Enfield Technical College</em>.
Built in 1955, it was later named after Roderick McCrae, who was the Principal from 1955 to 1962.&lt;br /&gt; <strong>PASCAL</strong>: The Pascal Building is named after Eric Pascal who was Education Officer of the Borough of Enfield from before 1942 until 1945 or later, and clerk to the Governors of Enfield College from 1949 to 1965.</p>
<p>The campus got closed in July 2008, and the majority of departments located here moved to the extended Hendon campus and some to the Archway Campus shared with UCL.</p>
<h2>Schools of Middlesex University</h2>
<p> Middlesex University is divided into five Schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>School of Arts and Education</li>
  <li>Business School</li>
  <li>School of Engineering &amp; Information Sciences (formerly, School of Computing Science)</li>
  <li>School of Health and Social Sciences</li>
  <li>Institute for Work Based Learning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business School</h3>
<p>Based at Hendon campus, Middlesex University Business School (MUBS) is over 50 years old.
It has run business studies qualifications since the <a>1950s</a> at what was then Hendon College of Technology and offered the UK's first degree in business studies in 1965.
The University also runs a small business school in <a>Quarry Bay</a>, <a>Hong Kong</a>, offering two courses from Middlesex University in London.</p>
<h3>Institute for Work Based Learning</h3>
<p>The Institute for Work Based Learning (or IWBL) pioneered the development of Work Based Learning at higher education level during the early 1990s.
It grew out of Work Based Learning Research and Development Project, which was initially funded by the <a>Department for Education and Employment</a> over 1992-1994.
The funding allowed the University to establish Middlesex University Organisational Development Network (or MODNet), a centre of a national network of expertise in work-based learning.
Essentially, MODNet offers learning and development programmes co-designed with employers and acts as a &#x2018;one-stop shop&#x2019;, able to respond to all employer training needs, drawing on partner expertise where appropriate.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>Middlesex University has a very diverse student body, around 21,000 strong, many of whom are mature students.
Around 4,800 students (23%) are from overseas, with ca.
3,400 (16%) from outside of the <a>European Union</a>.
The application/places ratio is 6.1:1 (2002).
The University also has student exchange links with over 100 different universities in more than 22 different countries across <a>Europe</a>, the <a>United States</a>, and the world.</p>
<p>The number of students at Middlesex University has declined by 15% over 2004-2008, with the number PG students falling by 20% (from over 6,000 in 2004 to less than 5,000 in 2008).
This situation has arisen due to a dispute over a &#x00a3;300,000 debt owed by MUSU to the University.</p>
<h2>Restructuring</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|right|Middlesex University old logo</a> In May 2001 Middlesex University appointed C Eye, a branding consultancy, to design a new logo for the University.
In 2003 the previous &quot;M&quot; logo was replaced with a new red-coloured wavy line that is supposed to express a flexible and responsive approach to the needs of students.</p>
<p>Following the review of the sustainability of its academic programmes, the university implemented a string of cost-containment adjustments over 2005-2006.
Specifically, in late 2005 it decided to stop offering history courses in an attempt to reduce &#x00a3;10 million deficit that had built up.
The decision, however, was met with considerable hostility from Middlesex's student union as well as from <a>The National Union of Students</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2000 Middlesex embarked on a new strategy to achieve &#x2018;fewer, better campuses&#x2019; in order to reduce costs and improve the long-term sustainability of the University.
The University has also closed the Corporate Services building at the <a>North London Business Park</a> and consolidated most of the functions carried out on these sites at Hendon, where it aims to accommodate nearly all its London based teaching.
building on its grade of 5 in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise.
An international campaign of support was quickly organised, with figures such as <a>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak</a>, <a>Jean-Luc Nancy</a>, <a>Slavoj &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek</a>, <a>&#x00c9;tienne Balibar</a>, <a>David Harvey</a>, <a>Isabelle Stengers</a> and many others expressing their strong disapproval.
Articles condemning the decision appeared in the national press.
Within a week, more than 10,000 signatures to Save Philosophy at Middlesex were gathered  and students protested actively on campus and elsewhere for the restitution of the department.
In early June 2010 it was announced that the department's postgraduate component, the CRMEP, was to be transferred to Kingston University but the undergraduate programme still to be phased out.
Its resulting report said auditors had confidence in the University's current and likely future management of its academic standards and of the learning opportunities available to students.
There was also praise for the 'meticulous attention' given to the establishment, development and integration of the University's Dubai campus.
Middlesex also received QAA praise for its initiatives to improve student progression and achievement and the 'distinctive contribution' of the University's Work Based Learning programmes.</p>
<p>In 2006, the University was ranked second in a re-assessment of teaching quality in all English universities.
The Times Higher Education Supplement of 17 November 2006 reported on how the scores for each university, as marked by the Quality Assurance Agency, had been &#x201c;adjusted to remove the link with research&#x201d; and form a league table which had post-1992 universities performing strongly.</p>
<p>The Social Science Research Network (<a>SSRN</a>) ranks Middlesex University Business School among the top 20 international business schools in the world, ahead of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Middlesex University Business School is also rated as a &quot;centre of excellence&quot; by the <a>Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</a> (CIPD), the first university in the UK to offer courses accredited by the Chartered Institute of Marketing.</p>
<p>The University is home to two HEFCE 'Centres for Excellence in Learning and Teaching' - one in Work Based Learning - one in Mental Health and Social Work.</p>
<h3>National Student Survey</h3>
<p>The overall satisfaction rating from the <a>National Student Survey</a> (or NSS) increased from 69% in 2008/09 to 78% in 2009/10.</p>
<p>&lt;center&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<h3>League tables</h3>
<p>In <a>The Guardian</a>'s University Guide 2011, Middlesex scored 38.01 out of 100, which placed it 112&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; out of 118 universities ranked - a drop by 5 positions from 2010 ranking.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Guradian 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 2010&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>The Independent</a> newspaper league table 2011 ranked Middlesex 97&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; out of 115 universities.
The standing reflected a decline by 7 positions from the 2010 league table, when Middlesex was ranked 88&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; out of 113 universities.&lt;ref
name=&quot;The Independent 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent 2010&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Middlesex standing in 2011 according to <a>Times</a> was unchanged from the year before - 104&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; out of 113 universities.&lt;ref
name=&quot;The Times 2011&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;small&gt;* - data not available&lt;/small&gt;</p>
<h2>Prestigious Alumni</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As most other UK universities, Middlesex runs an <a>Alumni Association</a> that allows former students to maintain close contact with the University after their graduation.
Additionally, it offers various discount and benefits to its members, as well as organizes regular reunions and social events.</p>
