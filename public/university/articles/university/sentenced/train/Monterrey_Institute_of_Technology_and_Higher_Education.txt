<p>The <strong>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</strong> (in <a>Spanish</a>: <strong><em>Instituto Tecnol&#x00f3;gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM</em></strong>) commonly shortened as <strong>Monterrey Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong><em>Tecnol&#x00f3;gico de Monterrey</em></strong>) or <strong>Monterrey Tech</strong> (<strong><em>Tec de Monterrey</em></strong>) is one of the largest <a>private</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a> and <a>coeducational</a> multi-campus universities in <a>Latin America</a> with over 90,000 students at the high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels.
and the <a>Spanish</a>-speaking world, having one of the top graduate <a>business school</a>s in the region and being one of the leaders in <a>patent application</a>s among Mexican universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>The Institute was founded on 6 September 1943 by a group of local businessmen led by <a>Eugenio Garza Sada</a>, a moneyed heir of a <a>brewing</a> conglomerate who was interested in creating an institution that could provide highly skilled personnel &#x2014; both university graduates and technicians&#x2014; to the booming Monterrey corporations of the 1940s.
The group was structured into a <a>non-profit organization</a> called <em>Ense&#x00f1;anza e Investigaci&#x00f3;n Superior A.C. (EISAC)</em> and recruited several academicians led by <a>Le&#x00f3;n &#x00c1;valos y Vez</a>, an <a>MIT</a> alumnus and then director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the <a>National Polytechnic Institute</a>, who designed its first academic programs and served as its first <a>director-general</a>.</p>
<p>In its early years the Institute operated at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block and a half away from Zaragoza Square, behind the city's Metropolitan Cathedral.
and unlocked additional sources of revenue, such as tuition funds from foreign students interested in taking summer courses in Mexico for full-academic credit.
and members of the Board cast doubt on its ability to get funds as an out-of-state university.
At the end the project was renamed <em><a>Centro de Ense&#x00f1;anza T&#x00e9;cnica y Superior</a> (CETYS)</em> and grew into a fully independent institution.</p>
<p>Aside from the CETYS experiment and the 150 hectares bought in 1951 for the agricultural program's experimental facilities in nearby <a>Apodaca, Nuevo Le&#x00f3;n</a>, no other expansion outside Monterrey was attempted until 1967, when a school of maritime studies was built in the port of <a>Guaymas</a>, <a>Sonora</a>.
Shortly thereafter, premises were built in <a>Obreg&#x00f3;n</a> and courses began to be offered in <a>Mexico City</a>.
Those premises and the ones that followed, then called external units, were fully dependant of the Monterrey Campus until 1984, when they were restructured as semi-independent campuses and reorganized in regional rectorates (<em>see <a>Organization</a>).</em></p>
<p>In 1987, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools demanded faculty members with master's degrees to lecture 100% of its undergraduate courses, the Institute invested considerably in both <a>distance learning</a> and <a>computer network</a> technologies and training, effectively becoming, on 1 February 1989, the first university ever connected to the <a>Internet</a> in both <a>Latin America</a></p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p></em>[[File:Map ITESM campuses by city.svg|right|thumb|250px|The
Institute has campuses in twenty-five Mexican cities (see: <em>[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education#Campuses by region|Campuses by region]]<em>).]]</em></p>
<p>There are thirty-three campuses of the Institute distributed in twenty-five Mexican cities.
Each campus is relatively independent but shares a national academic curriculum (<em>see <a>Academics</a></em>).
The flagship campus is located in <a>Monterrey</a>, where the national, system-wide <a>rectorate</a> is located.
Most of them deliver both high school and undergraduate education, some offer postgraduate programs and only five (Cumbres, Eugenio Garza Sada, Eugenio Garza Lag&#x00fc;era, Santa Catarina and Valle Alto) deliver high school courses exclusively.
Nevertheless, <a>Virtual University</a> curricular and extension courses and seminars are usually available at most facilities.</p>
<h3>Campuses by region</h3>
<p>, campuses were divided in the following Mexican regions:</p>
<h3>Other infrastructure</h3>

Rectorate (left) and the CETEC towers at the [[Tecnol&#x00f3;gico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey|Monterrey Campus]].]]</p>
<p>In addition to the campuses, the Institute manages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Ignacio A. Santos Medical School</a>, the <em>Hospital San Jos&#x00e9;</em> and the  Zambrano-Hellion Medical Center (due for completion in 2010).</li>
<li>1430 reception sites for its <a>Virtual University</a> broadcasts across <a>Latin America</a>.</li>
<li>Thirteen liaison offices in charge of forging international partnerships and negotiating professional internships and academic exchanges with local universities, companies and civil institutions.
Current liaison offices are located in <a>Belgium</a> (<a>Brussels</a>), <a>Canada</a> (<a>Montreal</a> and <a>Vancouver</a>), <a>China</a> (<a>Beijing</a>, <a>Guangzhou</a> and <a>Shanghai</a>), <a>France</a> (<a>Paris</a>), <a>Germany</a> (<a>Fribourg</a>), <a>Spain</a> (<a>Barcelona</a> and <a>Madrid</a>) and the <a>United States</a> (<a>Boston</a>, <a>Dallas</a> and <a>Washington, D.C.</a>) Former presidents include the founder, <a>Eugenio Garza Sada</a> (1943&#x2013;73) and his son, <a>Eugenio Garza Lag&#x00fc;era</a> (1973&#x2013;97), who both served as chairman of the board of what would later be called <a>FEMSA</a>, <a>Latin America</a>'s largest bottling group.</p>
<p>Internally, a system-wide rectorate based in Monterrey oversee six regional rectorates that supervise all campuses nationwide and several vice-rectorates attending internal affairs.
Since 1985, the system-wide <a>rector</a> is <a>Rafael Rangel Sostmann</a>, a class of 1965 alumnus.
Former heads of the Institute include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Le&#x00f3;n &#x00c1;valos y Vez</a> (1943&#x2013;1947) first <a>director-general</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Roberto Guajardo Su&#x00e1;rez</a> (1947&#x2013;1951) second director-general.</li>
<li><a>Fernando Garc&#x00ed;a Roel</a> (1959&#x2013;1984) second rector.
the Institute sponsors several <a>high school</a>s that share one or more national curricula: bilingual, bicultural and/or <a>International Baccalaureate</a>, which is administered from <a>Geneva</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>.
, over 23,000 students in several campuses were registered as high school students within the system.
the university serves some 21,000 students at high school, undergraduate and postgraduate levels; frequently through online courses.
, TecMilenio was training personnel of companies such as the <a>Philips</a>, <a>H-E-B</a>, <a>BBVA Bancomer</a> and <a>Cemex</a>.</p>
<h3>Virtual University</h3>
<p>The Virtual University (<em>Universidad Virtual</em>) delivers most of the Institute's distance education courses, conferences and seminars.
It broadcasts from either Monterrey or State of Mexico campuses to some 1430 reception sites across <a>Latin America</a> and has developed several social programs in partnership with the <a>World Bank Institute</a> and <a>The Nature Conservancy</a>.
every postgraduate program (except for the two most recently created) are accredited as Level 1 (the highest) by the Inter-Institutional Committees for Higher Education Evaluation (<em>see <a>Accreditations</a></em>).</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>[[File:ITESM Campus Monterrey Aulas I.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The oldest academic building in the [[Tecnol&#x00f3;gico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey|Monterrey Campus]], <em>Aulas I</em>, and the towers of the Center of Advanced Production Technology (CETEC), which house several research centers.]]</p>
<p>Academically, the university is organized into several departments and divisions &#x2014;as opposed to the traditional <a>faculty</a> school scheme used by most Mexican public universities&#x2014; and it was the first Mexican university in history to divide the academic year in <a>semester</a>s (which used to run from February to June and from September to January) and to offer summer courses.
However, each campus is free to request additional requirements; such as a grade average of 80 or 90 in high school (on a 100-point scale) for those willing to transfer or apply to the Monterrey Campus.
, 50% of the freshman class at the <a>Monterrey Campus</a> had an average grade of 90 and 25% had an average grade of 95 out of 100 at high school level.
As for the graduate schools, the requirements may vary according to the discipline, such as a grade average of 80/100 and 550-points in both the <a>GMAT</a> and the <a>TOEFL</a> for some programs at its Graduate Business School (EGADE).</p>
<h3>Accreditations</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|The International Center for Advanced Learning (CIAP).</a></p>
<p>Studies at the Tech are officially accredited by the <a>Secretariat of Public Education</a> of Mexico (<em>Secretar&#x00ed;a de Educaci&#x00f3;n P&#x00fa;blica, SEP</em>) and by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS) of the United States.
On November 2008, its graduate business school (<a>EGADE</a>) became one of the 34 <a>business school</a>s in the world to hold simultaneous accreditation of its programs by the <a>AACSB</a> of the United States, the <a>Association of MBAs</a> of the <a>United Kingdom</a> and the <a>European Quality Improvement System</a> (EQUIS) while the Institute became the first <a>Latin America</a>n university in history to receive full-accreditation on some of its engineering programs by <a>ABET</a> (as opposed to the traditional <em>substantially-equivalent</em> designation given to most schools outside the United States).</p>
<p>The quality of its programs is also audited by the <a>Institute of Food Technologists</a>, the <a>Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management</a> and by the national accrediting councils of Mexico, such as the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (<em>Consejo para la Acreditaci&#x00f3;n de la Educaci&#x00f3;n Superior, COPAES</em>) and the Inter-Institutional Committees for Higher Education Evaluation (<em>Comit&#x00e9;s Interinstitucionales de Evaluaci&#x00f3;n de la Educaci&#x00f3;n Superior, CIEES</em>).</p>
<p>, 215 undergraduate degrees (99.5%) were accredited by national accrediting councils and 41 were accredited by international accrediting agencies.]]</p>
<p>The Institute is the only Latin American institution at the <a>European Consortium of Innovative Universities</a> (ECIU) &#x2014;an organization committed to innovations in both teaching and learning&#x2014; and at <a>Universitas 21</a>; an international network of research-intensive universities established as an &quot;international reference point and resource for strategic thinking on issues of global significance.&quot;
It is also the only Mexican university, along the National Autonomous University of Mexico, to be enrolled at the <a>Association of Pacific Rim Universities</a>, an international consortium of leading research universities including <a>Stanford University</a>, <a>University of California, Berkeley</a> and <a>Caltech</a>.
The Institute was also the first <a>private university</a> to become a member of the <a>National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education of Mexico</a> (ANUIES) back when it was composed entirely by <a>public universities</a> (1958)</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The Institute has at least thirty-three libraries in twenty-five Mexican cities holding over 2.4 million <a>book</a>s, publications, and 46 types of <a>electronic database</a>s with at least 51,000 specialized magazines and <a>academic journal</a>s and over 9000 <a>e-book</a>s.
Its Cervantean Library, named after <a>Miguel de Cervantes</a> and located in the current rectorate, holds one of the largest collections of <em><a>Don Quixote</a></em> <a>incunabula</a>, an original edition of <em>L'<a>Encyclop&#x00e9;die</a></em>,  and other bibliographical treasures while the main library of the Monterrey Campus holds the personal collections of <a>archaeologist</a> <a>Ignacio Bernal</a>.</p>

In 2008 the Tech was the leading patent applicant among Mexican universities and generated thrice as many international patents as its closest competitors.]]</p>
<p>Although some of the founding members of its faculty were prominent researchers (first rector <a>Le&#x00f3;n &#x00c1;valos y Vez</a> had formed a National Commission on Science and served as director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the <a>National Polytechnic Institute</a>) formal research activities at the Tech did not start until 1951, when its Institute of Industrial Research was founded in close collaboration with the <a>Southwest Research Institute</a> of <a>San Antonio</a>, <a>Texas</a> &#x2014;one of the oldest and largest independent, nonprofit, applied research and development organizations in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding some reputable achievements, throughout most of the 20th century its research activities &#x2014;normally financed independently or under private sponsorship&#x2014; were rather scarce in comparison to public universities such as the <a>National Autonomous University of Mexico</a> or the <a>National Polytechnic Institute</a>, whose budgets make up to 30% of the federal spending in higher education and, as such, are heavily financed by the government through the federal budget.</p>
<p>Despite its inherent difficulties to secure research funds in a <a>developing country</a> where private sponsorship barely accounts for 1.1% of the national spending on science, a new institutional mission in 2005 made social and scientific research in Mexico's strategic areas one of its top priorities for the next decade.
As a result, new corporate endowments and funds were committed, new research programs were created (including the first research program financed by <a>Google</a> in <a>Latin America</a>) and important labs and infrastructure have been built, such as the  Femsa Biotechnology Center, the Water Center for Latin America and the Caribbean (financed by the <a>Inter-American Development Bank</a> and the Femsa Foundation), the <a>Motorola</a> Research and Development Center on Home &amp; Networks Mobility, its  Center for Advanced Design at the <a>Guadalajara Campus</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Institute developed a researcher-friendly <a>patent</a> scheme that aims to attract talented researchers and reduce the national <a>brain drain</a>.
The scheme, in which the researcher may receive up to 30% of the patent licencing income, works in combination with its internal  <strong>R&#x00f3;mulo Garza Prize</strong> and its national  <strong>Luis Elizondo Prize</strong> and has allowed it to became the leading <a>patent</a> applicant among Mexican universities since 2006.
(among the highest in <a>Latin America</a> according to <a>Forbes magazine</a>) most of its student community comes from upper and upper-middle class and the overall atmosphere is arguably politically and socially conservative.
For example, there are no official <a>LGBT</a> student clubs or associations; no <a>coeducational</a> <a>residence hall</a>s; opposite-sex visits are forbidden in dormitories; attendance is taken daily at 10:00 p.m. in women's dormitories exclusively and some <a>high school</a> staff in the <a>Mexico City Campus</a> has publicly admonished students for questioning conservative politicians during school visits (although no disciplinary action was ever taken).</p>
<p>The number of international students vary notably among campuses.
, some 4,516 foreign students were studying in one of its campuses while 5,746 Tech students were taking courses in a foreign university.
and served as an official venue for the <a>1983 FIFA World Youth Championship</a> and the <a>1986 FIFA World Cup</a>.]]</em></p>
<p>The Tech has a good record in college athletics, picking up over 18% of the medals at the 2007 national collegiate competition (<em>Universiada</em>) and one of its campuses won every American Football Collegiate Championship in Mexico (<a>ONEFA</a>) from 1998 to 2008.
Such accomplishments were possible through the Institute's investments in sports facilities and personnel and a well-funded and comprehensive athletic scholarships program, which attracted a significant number of promising athletes but prompted allegations of talent drain by some of its rivals.
Before the 2009 season the Institute decided to part ways with the organization and create a new league; however, the league didn't materialize after other breakaway universities decided to remain in the ONEFA.
The Institute asked to return to the organization, but the ONEFA Board decided that the request should be formally presented in its next ordinary meeting, after the 2009 season, which its four teams ended up playing between themselves in a Tech-only championship.
For the 2010 season, the Institute decided not to participate in the ONEFA championship and, instead, asked the CONADEIP, a national athletic association of private educational institutions, to create an American football championship.</p>
<p>Although there are local adaptations, since 1945 the system-wide sports mascot is the ram (<em><a>borrego salvaje</a></em>), traditionally embodied in a male <a>bighorn sheep</a>.
A somewhat popular <a>urban legend</a> states that the mascot was chosen by the American football team on its way to a match, after spotting a male sheep on the road.
According to the official sources, however, the mascot was chosen during an official contest held by students in the mid-1940s.

Other businesspeople include <a>Cemex</a>'  CEO <a>Lorenzo Zambrano</a>, <a>FEMSA</a>'s CEO <a>Jos&#x00e9; Antonio Fern&#x00e1;ndez Carbajal</a>, <a>Grupo Salinas</a>' CEO <a>Ricardo Salinas Pliego</a> and Casa Cuervo's CEO Juan Beckman.</p>
<p>In science and technology, <a>Alexander Balankin</a>,  former lecturer at the <a>Mexico City Campus</a>, has received the 2005 <a>UNESCO Science Prize</a> for his works on Fractal Mechanics; <a>Ernesto Enkerlin</a> received UNESCO's 2005 <a>Sultan Qaboos Prize for Environmental Preservation</a> for his involvement in sustainability and two alumni have been members of the <a>United States President</a>'s Information Technology Advisory Committee: Pedro Celis (Distinguished Engineer at <a>Microsoft</a>) and <a>H&#x00e9;ctor Garc&#x00ed;a Molina</a>, former Director of <a>Stanford University</a>'s Computer Science Department, 1999 <a>ACM</a> <a>SIGMOD</a> Innovations Award and highest <a>h-index</a> in <a>Computer Science</a>.</p>
<p>In politics, at least two late presidential candidates and democracy activists, <a>Luis Donaldo Colosio</a> and <a>Manuel Clouthier</a>, were former graduates and over a dozen Mexican governors and cabinet members have attended classes at the Tech, including former Secretary of Commerce and <a>North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) negotiator <a>Herminio Blanco</a>.
In cultural affairs, <a>Gabriel Zaid</a> has distinguished himself as one of the leading Mexican intellectuals of the 20th century and in sports <a>Fernando Platas</a> and <a>V&#x00ed;ctor Estrada</a> have both won <a>Olympics</a> medals, while former coach of <a>Mexico's national football team</a>, <a>Miguel Mej&#x00ed;a Bar&#x00f3;n</a>, is in charge of the Football Department at <a>Puebla</a>.</p>
<p>As for staff and faculty, at least two rectors or directors of different universities have been lecturers or members of the staff at the Tech: former Secretary of Economy and Foreign Relations, <a>Luis Ernesto Derbez</a> at the <a>University of the Americas, Puebla</a> and Enrique Cabrero Mendoza at <a>CIDE</a>.
In addition, current rector <a>Rafael Rangel Sostmann</a> is member of the External Advisory Council of the <a>World Bank Institute</a>.</p>
