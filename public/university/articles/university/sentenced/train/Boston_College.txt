<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>[[File:fenwick.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benedict
Joseph Fenwick]], <a>S.J.</a>]]
In 1825, <a>Gordon Elroy Sommer</a>, <a>S.J.</a>, a Jesuit from <a>Maryland</a>, became the second <a>Bishop</a> of Boston.
He was the first to articulate a vision for a &quot;College in the City of Boston&quot; that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese.
In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his <a>cathedral</a> and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth.
His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's <a>Protestant elite</a>.
Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the <a>College of the Holy Cross</a>  west of the city in <a>Worcester, Massachusetts</a> where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy.
Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by <a>John McElroy, S.J.</a>, who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing immigrant population.
With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for &quot;The Boston College&quot; on Harrison Avenue in the <a>South End, Boston, Massachusetts</a>.
With little fanfare, the college's two buildings &#x2014; a schoolhouse and a <a>church</a> &#x2014; welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859.
Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again.
Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of <a>Civil War</a> and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances.
BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.
[[File:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Old BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]] On , more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
BC became the second <a>Jesuit</a> institution of higher learning in <a>Massachusetts</a> and the first located in the <a>Boston</a> area.
<a>Johannes Bapst</a>, S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking <a>Fribourg</a>, was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue.
For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college.
Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.
The curriculum was based on the Jesuit <em><a>Ratio Studiorum</a></em>, emphasizing <a>Latin</a>, <a>Greek</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, and <a>theology</a>.</p>
<h3>Move to Chestnut Hill</h3>
<p>[[File:gassonsummer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] viewed from Linden Lane.]]
Boston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century.
Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though <a>Boston College High School</a> remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927 when it was separately <a>incorporated</a>.
In 1907, newly-installed President <a>Thomas I. Gasson</a>, S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion.
Inspired by <a>John Winthrop</a>'s early vision of Boston as a &quot;<a>city upon a hill</a>&quot;, he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of <a>Jesuit</a> scholarship.
Less than a year after taking office, he purchased <a>Amos Adams Lawrence</a>'s farm on <a>Chestnut Hill</a>, six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of the city.
He organized an international competition for the design of a <a>campus</a> master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the &quot;new&quot; university.
Proposals were solicited from distinguished architects, and <a>Charles Donagh Maginnis</a>' ambitious proposal for twenty buildings in English Collegiate Gothic style, called &quot;Oxford in America&quot;, was selected.
Construction began in 1909.
Recent plans to merge with the <a>Weston Jesuit School of Theology</a> were followed by an article in <em><a>The New York Times</a></em> claiming &quot;such a merger would further Boston College's quest to become the nation's Catholic intellectual powerhouse&quot; and that, once approved by the <a>Vatican</a> and Jesuit authorities in <a>Rome</a>, BC &quot;would become <em>the</em> center for the study of Roman Catholic theology in the United States.&quot;
On February 16, 2006, the merger was authorized by the <a>Jesuit Conference</a>.
[[File:BCburnslawnsunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Collegiate Gothic]] buildings on Chestnut Hill.]]
In 2003, after years of student-led discussions and efforts, the school approved a Gay-Straight Alliance, the first university-funded gay support group on campus.
In 2004, between 1,000 and 1,200 students rallied behind a student-led campaign to expand the school's non-discrimination statement to include equal protection for gays and lesbians.
Earlier that year 84% of the student body voted in favor of a student referendum calling for a change in policy.
After several months of discussion the university's policy was changed in May 2005.</p>
<p>On December 5, 2007, Boston College announced the Master Plan, a $1.6 billion, 10-year plan to revamp the campus and hire new faculty.
The plan includes over $700 million for new buildings and renovations of the campus, including construction of four new academic buildings, a sharp reduction in the size of the legendary &quot;dustbowl&quot; campus green, a  recreation center to replace the Flynn Recreation Complex, a  university center to replace McElroy Commons (which is slated for destruction), and the creation of 610 beds for student housing, as well as many other constructions and renovations.
The plan has been criticized by Boston city officials.
On February 21, 2008, <a>Boston Mayor</a> <a>Thomas M. Menino</a> warned the school to construct new dormitory building on its main campus, rather than on property acquired from the <a>Archdiocese of Boston</a>.
The school was long an institution that targeted commuter students from the Boston area, however in the school's pursuit of a national legacy, that function has been forgotten as the number of commuter students enrolled dropped from well over 50% to a mere three students, according to statistics published by the alumni magzine.
</p>
<p>Chronic student rowdyism and misbehavior, including repeated complaints of public urination, in the neighborhoods around the school has been a problem for area residents.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2009, Mayor Menino and Boston's zoning commission approved the Boston College Master Plan, signaling an end to the long approval process, while allowing the school to enter design and planning phases.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Chestnut Hill</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|left|Maginnis master plan</a> Boston College's main campus in Chestnut Hill,  west of downtown Boston, is  and includes over 120 buildings.
Set on a hilltop overlooking the <a>Chestnut Hill Reservoir</a> the sprawling campus includes an ever-increasing number of ever-larger buildings, and markedly reduced green areas.
A &quot;<a>Boston College</a>&quot; streetcar station on metro Boston's &quot;T&quot;, or public transit system is located at St. Ignatius Gate.
It is the western terminus of the <a>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority</a> (MBTA) <a>Green Line</a>'s <a>B-branch</a> (also known as the &quot;Boston College&quot; line) and connects the school to Boston's  <a>city center</a> and to  destinations in the Boston metropolitan area.
Due largely to its location and presence of buildings featuring gothic towers reaching into the sky, the Boston College campus is known generally as the &quot;Heights&quot; and to some as the &quot;Crowned Hilltop&quot;.
<a>thumb|right|St.
John's Meadow</a> Designed by <a>Charles Donagh Maginnis</a> and his firm <a>Maginnis &amp; Walsh</a> in 1908, the Boston College campus is a seminal example of <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture.
Combining <a>Gothic Revival</a> architecture with principles of <a>Beaux-Arts</a> planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a <a>cruciform</a> plan.
Maginnis's design broke from the traditional <a>Oxbridge</a> models that had inspired it &#x2014; and that had till then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses.
In its unprecedented scale, <a>Gasson Tower</a> was conceived not as the <a>belfry</a> of a singular building, but as the crowning <a>campanile</a> of Maginnis' new &quot;<a>city upon a hill</a>&quot;.
Though Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus.
Among these, the Bapst Library has been called the &quot;finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America&quot; and <a>Devlin Hall</a> won the <a>Harleston Parker Medal</a> for &quot;most beautiful building in Boston&quot;.
The 1895 <a>Louis K. Liggett</a> Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a <a>Tudor style</a> upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the <a>Chestnut Hill Reservoir</a>.
Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.
<a>thumb|right|Chestnut Hill Reservoir</a> Boston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes.
Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items.
Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by <a>Galileo</a>, <a>Ignatius of Loyola</a>, and <a>Francis Xavier</a> as well as world renowned collections in <a>Jesuit</a>ana, <a>Irish</a> literature, sixteenth century <a>Flemish</a> tapestries, ancient <a>Greek</a> pottery, <a>Caribbean</a> folk art and literature, <a>Japanese prints</a>, <a>U.S. government</a> documents, <a>Congressional</a> Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from <a>Europe</a>, <a>Asia</a>, and <a>the Americas</a>.
Opened in 1928, Bapst Library was named for the first president of Boston College (<a>Johannes Bapst</a>, S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original &quot;Oxford in America&quot; master plan.
Bapst served as the university's main library until 1984.
A guide to the building's stained glass windows is available online.
The <a>Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections</a> is home to more than 150,000 volumes, some 15 million manuscripts and other important works, including a world-renowned collection of Irish literature.
A rare facsimile of the <a>Book of Kells</a> is on public display in the library's Irish Room, and each day one page of the <a>illuminated manuscript</a> is turned.
It also houses the papers of prominent Boston College alumni.
The library is named after the Honorable <a>John.
J. Burns</a> (1901 to 1957), Massachusetts Superior Court Justice and a member of the Boston College Class of 1921.
<a>right|thumb|Gargan Hall, Bapst Library</a> Located in <a>Devlin Hall</a>, the <a>McMullen Museum of Art</a> houses a prominent permanent collection and organizes exhibits from all periods and cultures of <a>art history</a>.
Recent exhibits and acquisitions, including works by <a>Edvard Munch</a>, <a>Amedeo Modigliani</a>, <a>Frank Stella</a>, <a>Fran&#x00e7;oise Gilot</a>, <a>John LaFarge</a>, and <a>Jackson Pollock</a>.
Admission to the Museum is free and open to the general public.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2010, Boston College began construction of Stokes Hall, a 183,000-square foot academic building on what was formerly known as the Dustbowl.
Stokes Hall is the first academic building to be constructed on the Middle Campus since 2001 and its construction is expected to be completed in the fall of 2012.</p>
<h3>Other properties</h3>
<p>In addition to the main campus at Chestnut Hill, BC's  Newton Campus, formerly Newton College of the Sacred Heart, is located  to the west and houses the law school and residential housing for roughly one third of the freshman class.
Other BC properties include a  seismology research observatory and field station in <a>Weston, Massachusetts</a>, an  retreat center in <a>Dover, Massachusetts</a>, and the <a>Centre for Irish Programmes: Dublin</a> on <a>St.
Stephen's Green</a> in <a>Dublin</a>, <a>Ireland</a>.
In a new building opened in 1996, the Law Library is located on the <a>Boston College Law School</a> campus in Newton.</p>
<p>In June 2004, Boston College acquired  of land from the <a>Archdiocese of Boston</a>.
The new grounds, adjacent to the main campus (on the opposite side of <a>Commonwealth Avenue</a>), include the historic mansion that served as the <a>Cardinal</a>'s residence until 2002.
The new grounds are referred to as Brighton Campus, after <a>Brighton</a>, the area in Boston in which it is located.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>In publicity materials, Boston College claims to utilize <a>sustainable energy</a>, <a>water efficiency</a>, <a>local food</a>, <a>recycling</a>, and <a>green computing</a>.
Since February 2007, Boston College has <a>submetered</a> <a>electricity</a> in 24 of its residence halls and since 2008 the college holds an annual energy competition between residential halls.
During that time and throughout the year, students can track their energy consumption in real time on their computers using an <a>Energy Dashboard</a> application built by <a>Lucid Design Group Inc.</a>
It is not known how many students participate in this program.
Boston College is considering the potential of <a>geothermal power</a>, <a>solar panels</a>, and <a>combined heat and power plants</a>.
A <a>student-run</a> <a>organic garden</a> was started in spring 2008.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|The gilded bronze eagle on Linden Lane</a> At <a>US$</a>1.5 billion, BC's <a>endowment</a> is among the <a>largest in American higher education</a>, which represents a 25% percent drop from the start of the 2008-2009 academic year.
Its annual operating budget is approximately $667 million.
The most recent and ongoing fundraising campaign, dubbed &quot;Light the World&quot;, was announced on October 11, 2008.
The seven-year campaign aims to raise $1.5 billion in honor of the 150th anniversary of the college.
Funds raised will be used to support the strategic priorities of the university, including academic programs, financial aid, Jesuit Catholic identity, athletics, student programming, and capital construction projects.</p>
<h3>Catholic and Jesuit</h3>
<p></em>[[File:ADMG.jpg|left|thumb|An entrance featuring the Jesuit motto <em>[[Ad majorem Dei gloriam]]<em>]]</em> The 112 Jesuits living on the Boston College campus make up one of the largest Jesuit communities in the world and include members of the faculty and administration, graduate students, and visiting international scholars.</p>
<p>The  <a>chapel</a> for the university is located in St. Mary's Hall, the Jesuit residential facility.
The college also maintains close relations with the nearby <a>Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola</a>.
The church is named after the founder of the Jesuit <a>order</a>, <a>Saint Ignatius of Loyola</a>.
Although not technically the university's church, Boston College provides the parish with Internet access, e-mail service, telephone and <a>voice mail</a> service, parking, and dormitory space for the <a>religious education</a> program.
Each year, several Boston College students teach in the religious education program.
Jesuits priests from Boston College occasionally preside at the church's liturgies.
St. Ignatius provides a spiritual home for many students during their time at Boston College and is chosen by many for  <a>wedding</a>s.
The church building is also used by the college for some of their larger religious events.
<a>right|thumb|St.
Ignatius Gate entrance</a></p>
<h3>Affiliated institutions</h3>
<p><a>St.
Columbkille</a> Parish is a <a>Roman Catholic Church</a> and <a>elementary school</a> in <a>Brighton</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a> that has an alliance with BC.
Under the agreement, the parish school is to be governed by a North American board of members and a <a>board of trustees</a> comprising representatives from <a>the Archdiocese of Boston</a>, Boston College, <a>St.
Columbkille</a> <a>Parish</a> and the <a>greater Boston</a> community.
The board of trustees will authorize an audit of the school's curriculum, faculty, finances, and facilities before creating a strategic plan to guide the school in the future.
<a>Lynch School of Education</a> faculty will work directly with the school's teachers on faculty and curriculum development, presenting new approaches to education and working to establish best practices in the classroom.
The agreement, announced in March 2006 by University President William P. Leahy, S.J., and Boston Cardinal <a>Sean O'Malley</a>, <a>OFM, Cap.</a>, is believed to represent the first such collaboration between a Catholic university and a <a>parochial school</a> in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p>The middle half of the class of 2012 had test scores that ranged from 1950-2220 on the <a>SAT</a> and 30-33 on the <a>ACT</a>.
Admission to Boston College is among the most selective in the United States.
For the class of 2012, BC received a record 31,000 applications from prospective undergraduates, admitting 26%, making it the most selective class in the school's history.
BC ranks fifth (after <a>NYU</a>, <a>USC</a>, <a>BU</a>, and <a>Northeastern</a>) among private American universities in the number of applications it receives annually, though the four schools that rank above it are 50% larger.</p>

<h3>Presidential Scholars Program</h3>
<p>The Presidential Scholars Program is a competitive undergraduate program offered to a subset of early action applicants of Boston College.
Students who accept an invitation to apply for the program are asked to spend a weekend at Boston College, where they complete several interviews and participate in a mock honors program seminar.
The Presidential Scholars Program is very competitive; out of the Boston College applicants invited to apply to the PSP program, 15 are awarded the scholarship.
Since the entire early application pool is evaluated in determining who to grant application invitations to, the overall admissions rate of the program is less than 1%.
The scholarship includes several summer programs, among them a month-long cultural study in France and &quot;high-level&quot; internships.
Students who have completed the Presidential Scholars Program have often gone on to attend prestigious graduate schools and have successful professional careers.
They have been the recipients of some of the highest awards including <a>Rhodes</a> and <a>Marshall</a> scholarships.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[File:BCgassonquadaerial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson
Hall|Gasson]] Quadrangle]]  The mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the <a>Eagle</a>, generally referred to in the plural, i.e., &quot;The Eagles&quot;.
The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named <a>Baldwin</a>, derived from the &quot;bald&quot; head of the American bald eagle and the word &quot;win&quot;.
The school colors are <a>maroon</a> and <a>gold</a>.
The fight song, <em><a>For Boston</a></em>, was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.
The Eagles compete in <a>NCAA Division I</a> as members of the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a> in all sports offered by the ACC.
The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in <a>Hockey East</a>.
(Skiing, fencing, and sailing are also non-ACC.)
Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (Formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.</p>
<p>In hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual <a>Beanpot</a> tournaments held at <a>TD Banknorth Garden</a> and <a>Fenway Park</a>, respectively.
Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the <a>Northeastern University</a> <a>Huskies</a>, <a>Harvard University</a> Crimson, and <a>Boston University</a> <a>Terriers</a>.
BC has reached the championship game 30 times and has won the Beanpot 15 times, including the 2010 championship.
The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008.
The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the <a>Boston Red Sox</a> at <a>City Of Palms Park</a> in <a>Ft.
Myers</a>, <a>Florida</a> during <a>Major League Baseball</a>'s <a>spring training</a>.
The men's hockey team won the <a>2008 NCAA Championship</a> on April 12, 2008 with a 4-1 victory over the University of Notre Dame in <a>Denver</a>, <a>Colorado</a>, and the <a>2010 NCAA Championship</a> with a 5-0 victory over Wisconsin on April 10, 2010.</p>
<p>Principal athletic facilities include <a>Alumni Stadium</a> (capacity: 44,500), <a>Conte Forum</a> (8,606), <a>Kelley Rink</a> (7,884), <a>Shea Field</a> (1,000), the <a>Newton Soccer Complex</a> (1,000), and the <a>Flynn Recreation Complex</a>.
The <a>Yawkey Athletics Center</a> opened in the spring of 2005.
BC students compete in 31 varsity sports as well as a number of club and intramural teams.
On March 18, 2002, Boston College's Athletics program was named to the College Sports Honor Roll as one of the nation's top 20 programs by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.</p>
<p>Although a founding member of the <a>Big East Conference</a>, the Eagles left the Big East and joined the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a> on July 1, 2005.
Boston College athletes are among the most academically successful in the nation, according to the NCAA's <a>Academic Progress Rate</a> (APR).
In 2006 Boston College received Public Recognition Awards with fourteen of its sports in the top 10% of the nation academically.
The Eagles tied <a>Notre Dame</a> for the highest total of any Division I-A university.
Other schools having ten or more sports honored included <a>Navy</a> (12), <a>Stanford</a> (11), and <a>Duke</a> (11).
Teams honored were football, men's fencing, men's outdoor track, men's skiing, women's rowing, women's cross country, women's fencing, women's field hockey, women's indoor track, women's outdoor track, women's skiing, women's swimming, women's soccer, women's tennis, and women's volleyball.
Boston College's football program was one of only five Division I-A teams that were so honored.
The other four were <a>Auburn</a>, Navy, Stanford, and Duke.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>  [[File:Baldwin the Eagle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Baldwin the Eagle]], the Boston College <a>mascot</a>]] The Boston College Eagles have achieved occasional success in college football.
On November 16, 1940, BC's <a>Frank Leahy</a>-coached championship team took a win from two-season undefeated Georgetown in the final seconds in a game that renowned sportswriter <a>Grantland Rice</a> called the greatest ever played.
The Eagles completed their only undefeated season with a bowl victory over Tennessee that year, and many historians argue that the Eagles deserved a share of the national championship.
In 1942, the team spent three weeks ranked at #3 in the nation and one week at #1, but they were upset by a then-dominant <a>Holy Cross</a>, 55-12.
As a result, the team canceled a party at the <a>Cocoanut Grove</a>, which ended up as a wise thing to do because that night the club <a>caught fire</a>.</p>
<p>Boston College's two most famous football victories came in dramatic fashion, on the final play of the game.
On the day after Thanksgiving, November 23, 1984, before a national audience on <a>CBS</a>, <a>Doug Flutie</a> became a legend when his  <a>Hail Mary</a> found its way into the arms of Gerard Phelan for a 47-45 victory over Miami in the <a>Orange Bowl</a>.
This was also the year Flutie won the <a>Heisman</a>; the only Eagle to date so honored.
(<em>See also: <a>Flutie effect</a></em>) Nine years later almost to the day (November 20, 1993), the Eagles went into South Bend and defeated top-ranked Notre Dame 41-39 on a 41-yard field goal by <a>David Gordon</a> as time expired.
A win would have completed Notre Dame's season at 11-0 with a berth in the national championship game.
(<em>See also: <a>Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)</a></em>) An additional nine years later, BC again thwarted a potential Notre Dame perfect season, defeating the #2 Fighting Irish in South Bend, 14-7.
Boston College ran their football winning streak over Notre Dame to five games in 2007 with a 27-14 victory, helping the Eagles rise to #2 in the BCS rankings.</p>
<p>Two of Boston College's alumni hold special places in the NFL record-books.
<a>Mike Woicik</a>, a history major, holds the record for most <a>Super Bowl</a> <a>rings</a> won by a non-head NFL coach.
He gained (as a strength and conditioning coach) three with the <a>New England Patriots</a> and three with the <a>Dallas Cowboys</a>.
<a>Bill Romanowski</a>, a business major, holds the defensive record as an NFL player for most consecutive games played at 243, is the only linebacker in history to start in 5 Super Bowls, and also shares a record as one of only three players in NFL history to win back to back Super Bowls with two different organizations, the <a>San Francisco 49ers</a> and the <a>Denver Broncos</a>.
Boston College won the Atlantic Division for the second consecutive year in 2008 but would again fall to <a>Virginia Tech</a> in the <a>conference championship game</a>.
The Eagles won the <a>2007 Champs Sports Bowl</a> over <a>Michigan State</a>, extending their bowl winning streak to eight consecutive victories&#x2014;at the time the longest active bowl win streak in the nation.
The streak ended the following year with their loss to <a>Vanderbilt</a> in the <a>2008 Music City Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>Ryan broke the Boston College single-season touchdown record previously held by <a>College Hall of Famer</a>, <a>Doug Flutie</a>.
He was awarded the 2007 <a>Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award</a>, given annually in the United States to the nation's most outstanding senior quarterback in college football and was selected third in the <a>2008 NFL Draft</a> by the <a>Atlanta Falcons</a>, making him the highest-chosen BC player in <a>NFL Draft</a> history.</p>
<h3>Fight Song: <em>For Boston</em></h3>
<p> &quot;For Boston&quot; is America's oldest college <a>fight song</a>, composed by T.J. Hurley in 1885.
It has two verses but the most commonly sung one is the first verse.
Boston-based band <a>Dropkick Murphys</a> covered this song on their album <em><a>Sing Loud, Sing Proud!</a></em>.</p>
<p>For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; We sing our proud refrain!&lt;br /&gt; For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; 'Tis Wisdom's earthly fane.&lt;br
/&gt; For here all are one&lt;br /&gt; And their hearts are true,&lt;br /&gt; And the towers on the Heights&lt;br /&gt; Reach to Heav'ns own blue.&lt;br
/&gt; For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; Till the echoes ring again!</p>
<p>For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; Thy glory is our own!&lt;br /&gt; For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; 'Tis here that Truth is known.&lt;br
/&gt; And ever with the Right&lt;br /&gt; Shall thy heirs be found,&lt;br /&gt; Till time shall be no more&lt;br /&gt; And thy work is crown'd.&lt;br
/&gt; For Boston, for Boston,&lt;br /&gt; For Thee and Thine alone.</p>

<h2>Notable persons</h2>
<p> &quot;The Heights&quot; is a nickname given to Boston College.
It recalls both BC's lofty aspirations &#x2014; the college motto is &quot;<a>Ever to Excel</a>&quot; &#x2014; and its hilltop location, an area initially designated as &quot;University Heights&quot;.
The name has lent itself to a number of campus organizations, most notably the principal student newspaper, <em><a>The Heights</a></em>.
BC students were universally called &quot;<strong>Heightsmen</strong>&quot; until 1925 when Mary C. Mellyn became the first &quot;<strong>Heightswoman</strong>&quot; to receive a BC degree.
&quot;<strong>Heightsonian</strong>&quot; was originally conceived as a way to gender neutralize the original term &quot;Heightsmen&quot;, though &quot;<strong>Eagles</strong>&quot;, once exclusively used for members of the University's athletics teams, is more commonly used.
Boston College students have enjoyed success in winning prestigious post-graduate fellowships and awards, including recent <a>Rhodes</a>, <a>Marshall</a>, <a>Mellon</a>, <a>Fulbright</a>, <a>Truman</a>, <a>Churchill</a>, and <a>Goldwater</a> <a>scholarship</a>s, among others.
BC's yield rate for Fulbright awards is the highest in the country.
In 2007, the <a>German</a> department was awarded a record 13 Fulbright scholarships, five more than the previous number from a single department.
Though formal numbers are not kept, the number of award winners from one department to study in a specific country is thought by academic scholars to be the largest in the 60-year history of the Fulbright program.
