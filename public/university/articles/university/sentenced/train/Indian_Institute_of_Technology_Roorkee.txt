<p>The <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</strong> (<strong>IIT Roorkee</strong>) () is located in <a>Roorkee</a>, a township in <a>Uttarakhand</a>, <a>India</a>.
Instituted as <strong>Thomason College of Civil Engineering</strong> in year 1847 by the British, it was rechristened as <a>University of Roorkee</a> in year 1949.
Prior to independence, it awarded the degrees of the <a>University of Calcutta</a> and the <a>Allahabad University</a>, to which it was successively affiliated, followed by its own diplomas.
It was restructured in 1948 as the University of Roorkee, as the first engineering university of modern India.</p>
<h2>Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</h2>
<p>The oldest institute of technical education in Asia and the erstwhile British Empire to award its own degrees (as the <a>College of Engineering, Guindy</a> was not a degree granting institution since its inception in 1794), IIT Roorkee celebrated its sesquicentennial (150th year) anniversary in October 1996.
On 21 September 2001, an <a>ordinance</a> issued by the <a>Government of India</a> declared it as the nation's seventh Indian Institute of Technology.
The ordinance was converted into an act by the <a>Parliament</a> to make IIT Roorkee an &quot;Institution of National Importance&quot;.</p>

<p>IIT Roorkee offers a wide range of academic programmes including highly reputed MBA degree.
It runs eleven Under Graduate, five Integrated Dual Degree, three Integrated M.Tech., three integrated M.Sc., sixty one Post Graduate and several Doctoral Programmes.
</p>
<p>Along with the engineering courses, IIT Roorkee offers a 2 year residential MBA program.
The <a>Department of Management Studies</a> also offers Ph.D. in various disciplines.
Admission for these courses are through JMET, a centralized entrance examination for the MBA programs at various IITs.
IIT Roorkee MBA course in a very short span of time has gained enormous recognition due to its highly skilled learning teachniques and brilliant student profiles.
IIT MBA are now considered among the top MBA colleges of India.</p>
<p>IIT Roorkee is also running an MCA programme.
Typically, the MCA is a 3 year fulltime degree course consisting of six semesters.
It covers various aspects of computing, accounting, finance, programming, design and managing networks and databases.
Admission for this course is through JAM (joint admission test), a centralized examination for two-year MSc programmes at all IITs, Three-year MCA and M Tech in Applied Geology/Applied Geophysics at IIT Roorkee, MSc-PhD Dual Degree in Physics at IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur.</p>
<p>Prior to being converted into an IIT, the University selected students through an entrance exam, REE (Roorkee Entrance Exam) conducted on an All-India level.
The selectivity of REE was close to 2%.
After IIT-JEE, it was considered to be the second toughest Engineering Entrance Examination in India.
It was believed that one who was able to pass the REE was also able to pass IIT-JEE but not vice versa.
The Institute continues the legacy by admitting students to B.Tech. and B.Arch.
courses through the <a>IIT-Joint Entrance Examination</a> (JEE) conducted at various centers all over India.
The Institute is a member of <a>LAOTSE</a>, an international network of leading universities in <a>Europe</a> and <a>Asia</a> exchanging students and senior scholars.</p>
<h2>Heritage</h2>
<p>The College was established in year 1847 as the first engineering college in the British Empire.
The College was renamed as The Thomason College of Civil Engineering in 1854 in honour of its founder Mr. James Thomason, the then Lt. Governor of Northern provinces in 1853.
The first Indian to pass out from the Roorkee college was, Rai Bahadur Kanhaiya Lal (in 1852).
Initially, the college had Engineers class only for Europeans, Upper subbordinate class for Europeans &amp; Indians and Lower subbordinate class for Indians only.
Renowned people like Sir Proby Cautley, the then Director of Ganges canal, Col. Baird Smith- Director of Eastern Yamuna Canal, Governor generals of India, Sir Harcourt Butler, Gerald Lacey and many more dignitaries had a strong association with the college.
Such was the reputation of the college, that the recruitment of the Engineering students was directly controlled by the Public Works Departments (PWD).
Every student was guaranteed a post in the PWD/Irrigation deptts.
Roorkee passouts played a vital role in all the areas of engineering primarily civil.
From maintainence of Ganges canal, construction of massive dam and irrigation projects like Bhakra nangal, Rajasthan canal, Aswan dam on Nile in Egypt, construction of Chandigarh etc. Roorkee graduates were the flag bearers.
Between 1934 to 1943, officers of <a>Indian Army Corps of Engineers</a> also received training at the Thomason College of Engineering and even after the establishment of the School of Military Engineering (SME) at Roorkee in 1943, they continued to receive technical training at the Thomason college, till in 1948 when SME was moved to Dapodi, <a>Pune</a>.
It was given the status of University by Act No. IX of 1948 of the United Provinces (<a>Uttar Pradesh</a>) in recognition of its performance, potential and keeping in view the needs of post-independent India.
<a>Jawahar Lal Nehru</a>, the first <a>Prime Minister of India</a>, presented the Charter in November 1949, elevating the erstwhile college to the First Engineering University of Independent India.
Renowned soil scientist Dr. Jagdish Narain was the first student to be admitted into University under this act.
On the 21st September 2001, the University was declared an institute of national importance, by passing a bill in the parliament, changing its status from University of Roorkee to Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,making it the youngest IIT(before the creation of <a>new IIT's</a>).
IIT Roorkee is the mentor of IIT Mandi set up in 2009.</p>
