It is one of the four autonomous constituent colleges of <a>Anna University</a>.
It was started in 1949 by Mr. C. Rajam as the first self-financing engineering institute in the country, and later it merged with <a>Anna University</a>.
The Institute was at that time an experiment in technical education, for it introduced to India new areas of specialization:  aeronautical engineering, automobile engineering, electronics engineering, and instrumentation technology.
The MIT is the first institute in India to offer postgraduate courses in <a>avionics</a> and <a>mechatronics</a>.
This Institute also has a unique practice of &quot;T-Series&quot;, a student mentoring system by senior students.</p>
<p>The alumni of this institute have achieved prominence in various fields and include Dr. A.P.J. <a>Abdul Kalam</a> (the &quot;missile-man of India&quot;), and the writer Sujatha among others.
The cultural festival of MIT, Mitafest, is well known in the vicinity of Chromepet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>With the dawn of Independence, the need for establishing a sound technological basis for proper industrial advancement of the country was realised.
At this juncture, in 1949, Mr. Rajam Iyer donated Rs. 5 lakhs through the sale of his house and founded the M.I.T., and raised funds from various people and industries for its running.
Sri M.K. Ranganathan, Rtd.
Chief Engineer, became the first principal of the institute.
[[Image:Mit-hoarding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|MIT [[billboard|hoarding]] as seen from senior hostel terrace]] At a time when all other engineering institutions were offering conventional courses in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering at the undergraduate level, Mr. Rajam launched the experiment of introducing for the first time in the country totally new areas of specialisation in Engineering, namely aeronautical engineering, automobile engineering, electronics engineering, and instrument technology, the entrants to these disciplines being science graduates.
In addition to this, MIT also has computer science and information technology departments.
M.I.T. also offers technical education in engineering fields such as rubber and plastics technology, production engineering, and information technology.
Research centres were also started in the past years.</p>
<p>Instrumentation and Control did not exist in India as a subject of study in 1949; even the name was still below the horizon.
Now this branch of applied science and technology has become important in industry, and a significant number of the past students of M.I.T. now hold key positions in research and development organisations, manufacturing industries and educational institutions within the country and abroad.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>Madras Institute of Technology, being a constituent college of Anna University, is governed by a Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Registrar of the varsity.
The varsity has a syndicate too.
The Dean is the head of the Institute and oversees day-to-day activities.
Each department is led by a Head of the Department (HOD).
The hostels are headed by assistant executive wardens placed under an executive warden with dean as the ex-officio warden.&lt;br
/&gt; </p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|MIT campus as seen from main gate</a> The academic policies are decided by the course committee, whose members include all the professors and student representatives headed by a chairman.&lt;br
/&gt;   Madras Institute of Technology follows the <a>credit</a>-based system of performance evaluation and student-teacher relation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance.
The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of <a>grades</a>, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks.
For each semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average from all the courses with their respective credit points.
Each semester's evaluation is done independently with a cumulative <a>grade point average</a> (CGPA) reflecting the average performance across semesters.
The medium of instruction is English although teachers tend to deviate regularly into Tamil.
<a>thumb|right|200px|Hangar-2</a> The broad-based, theory-oriented education <strong>attempts</strong> to enable students of MIT to handle with skill and success a wide variety of technical problems.
MIT has remained an important centre of engineering education and earned an excellent reputation both in India and abroad.
Admission into the institute previously was through the <a>TNPCEE</a> .
But from 2007 it was decided that the 12th grade examinations would be the sole criterion which has favoured the entry of matriculation students.</p>
<p>Prominent alumni of this institute include Honorable President Dr.A.P.J. <a>Abdul Kalam</a>, <a>Sujatha Rangarajan</a>,  &amp; K B Chandrashekhar (founder of jamcracker.com
&amp; exodus.com in USA and AU-KBC Research Centre,MIT campus of Anna University).</p>
<h2>Culturals</h2>
