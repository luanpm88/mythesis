<p> &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: <a>right|thumb|267px|University of Southern Indiana Campus map.</a> --&gt; The <strong>University of Southern Indiana (USI)</strong> is a <a>public university</a> in <a>Vanderburgh County, Indiana</a>.
This publicly-funded institution is rapidly growing and is the fastest growing comprehensive state university in Indiana.
Record fall enrollment in 2010 reached 10,702.
The University has a modern  suburban campus situated within wooded rolling hills.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Regional campus</h3>
<p>The University of Southern Indiana began in 1965 as a regional branch of <a>Indiana State University</a>, which is located in <a>Terre Haute</a>.
Classes were originally held in a former elementary school on the west side of <a>Evansville</a> known as Centennial School &#x2013; denoting the year it was built in 1876.
The property was leased from <a>Bristol-Myers Squibb</a>, which still has a large facility nearby.</p>
<p>In 1971, the school moved to its current campus in western Vanderburgh County.
The first buildings constructed were the Science Center and the Wright Administration Building.
Slowly the school built facilities, as funding became available during the Indiana State University-Evansville period.</p>
<h3>Independence</h3>
<p>The relationship with Indiana State University was an awkward one from the start.
Local leaders, who were not pleased with the level of support, contended that if the campus was to thrive it would need to gain independent status.
A coordinated effort was made to establish the campus as an independent state university.</p>
<p>Opposition came immediately from Indiana State University along with <a>Indiana University</a> and <a>Purdue</a>, which were concerned that granting the campus independence would set a precedent for other small branch campuses around the state.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>Over 10,500 students enrolled at USI in the fall of 2009.
Although the student population is largely local and regional, the international student population is growing each year.
The University reported students came from 90 Indiana counties, 36 other states, and 42 other nations for the 2006-2007 academic year.
Additionally, more than 15,000 people participate annually in continuing education courses and special programs sponsored by the Division of Extended Services.
Over 20,000 students have graduated since 1971.
Nearly 75% of USI's graduates remain in <a>Indiana</a>.
Annual credit enrollment is expected to exceed 11,000 in the next five years.
The University serves an additional 9,000 persons annually through comprehensive noncredit programs of short duration.</p>
<p>Nearly all students who live on campus (with the exception of some freshmen who are housed in modern suite-style facilities) are assigned apartments with full kitchens.</p>

In 1967, the Southern Indiana Higher Education, Inc., (SIHE) acquired .
Since September 1969, the University has occupied , most of which was donated by SIHE.
Southern Indiana Higher Education, Inc. still owns  for development of higher education opportunities.</p>
<p>A new building for the School of Business, opened in 1990, was named the Orr Center in honor of Governor <a>Robert D. Orr</a>, an Evansville native.
Since then, four other large buildings have been built for the <a>Liberal Arts</a>, <a>Nursing</a>, and <a>Education</a> divisions, as well as a large fitness center for students and faculty.
The number of classrooms has more than doubled since the campus was first opened, but the University is still planning for continued growth.</p>
<p>Construction is complete on the David L. Rice Library, which opened in the fall semester of 2006.
The building is five stories and features computer access, study tables/rooms, and copy machines located on each floor.
With the growth of extracurricular organizations, the administration chose to convert the old library building into an extension of the University Center and is connected by an elevated walkway.
A new Business and Engineering Center is being built along with several other construction and renovation projects.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>:<em>Also see: <a>Sports in Evansville</a></em>.</p>
<p>The University of Southern Indiana Athletic Department is a competitive member of the <a>NCAA Division II</a> and the <a>Great Lakes Valley Conference</a>.
USI sponsors 15 varsity intercollegiate sports.
Since 1990, all 15 Screaming Eagles teams have participated in their respective national tournaments and/or were ranked at the national level.
USI has claimed two national championships (men's basketball, 1995 under head coach <a>Bruce Pearl</a>; men's baseball under coach Tracy Archuleta, 2010), finished three times as the national finalist (men's basketball, 1994 and 2004; and women's basketball, 1997), and earned one third-place finish (men's cross country, 1982).
The men's and women's cross country/track teams have produced five national championships since 1997:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elly Rono won three individual titles (1997 NCAA Division II Cross Country National Championships, 1998 NCAA Division II Indoor Track and Field Championships in the 5,000 Meters, and 1998 NCAA Division II Outdoor Track and Field Championships in the 10,000 m).</li>
  <li>Heather Cooksey won the 2004 NCAA Division II Outdoor Track and Field Championships in the 3,000 Meters.</li>
<li>Candace Perry won the 2005 NCAA Division II Outdoor Track and Field Championships in the Long Jump.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Screaming Eagles won the 2003-04 GLVC All-Sports Trophy by nine points, the largest margin of victory since Lewis University edged USI by 9.5 points in 1986-87.
In the 25 year history of the trophy, USI has finished first three times (2003&#x2013;04, 1993&#x2013;94, 1982&#x2013;83); second nine times; third twice; and fourth three times.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck the University of Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles men's basketball team on Thursday, January 14, 2010, when 6-foot-8, 260-pound senior post player <a>Jeron Lewis</a>, 21, fell around 9:05 PM during a play in a game at the <a>Owensboro Sportscenter</a> against <a>Kentucky Wesleyan College</a> (which ultimately ended with USI winning 74-69.
Afterwards, he went into convulsions as he was being tended to by trainers, which stopped when he was put on a gurney.
He was taken by ambulance to <a>Owensboro Medical Health System</a>, but he was pronounced dead at 9:52 PM.
His teammates and coaches were told 30 minutes later.
An autopsy was scheduled by <a>Daviess County, Kentucky</a> coroner Bob Howe; it was discovered that the death may have been cardiac-related (possibly due to a disease of the heart that caused an enlarged heart, or <a>cardiomegaly</a>). Lewis had earlier missed two games in December to be in his <a>Fort Wayne, Indiana</a> hometown for the birth of his son.
He was a transfer from <a>Northeastern Junior College</a> in Colorado.
In a statement, university president Linda Bennett said that he had been an excellent example of a student-athlete for his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball Controversy</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: <a>right|250px|thumb|Rick Herdes.
</a> --&gt; On May 13, 2009, USI submitted to the <a>NCAA</a> a list of NCAA rules violations committed by the men's basketball coaching staff, including Head Coach <a>Rick Herdes</a>.
Herdes had posted a 200-59 record after taking over as head coach when <a>Bruce Pearl</a> left for the head coaching job at <a>UW&#x2013;Milwaukee</a> in 2001.</p>
<p>USI discovered that Herdes had committed six violations of NCAA recruiting and academic eligibility rules; when the announcement was made Herdes promptly resigned.</p>
<p><strong>Violations and results are as followed:</strong></p>
<p>Three of the violations are related to extra benefits concerning transportation, one concerning academics, and the last concerning improper communication with a prospective student athlete.</p>
<p>1.
Two players are deemed ineligible from the beginning of the 2008-09 season.
Reinstatement of the student athletes by the NCAA remains a possibility.</p>
<p>2.
Forfeiture of all men's basketball games from the 2008-09 season.</p>
<p>3.
Return of $9,362 in funds provided by the <a>NCAA Division II</a> for the men&#x2019;s basketball team&#x2019;s participation in the 2009 <a>NCAA Division II Tournament</a>.</p>
<p>USI Athletic Director Jon Mark Hall went on record as saying:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Integrity and compliance are two of the cornerstones of all of our programs.
I feel that the issues are contained within the men&#x2019;s basketball program alone.
We will do what is right and will address mistakes that have been made, no matter what the outcome is.
This men&#x2019;s basketball program has a great tradition.
We will begin a search immediately for someone to lead this program.&#x201d;</em></p>
