<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bryn Mawr College</strong> (colloquially  , <a>Welsh</a>: ) is a <a>women's</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Bryn Mawr</a>, a community in <a>Lower Merion Township</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, ten miles west of <a>Philadelphia</a>.
The name &quot;Bryn Mawr&quot; means &quot;big hill&quot; in <a>Welsh</a>.</p>
<p>Bryn Mawr is one of the <a>Seven Sister colleges</a>, and is part of the <a>Tri-College Consortium</a> along with two other colleges founded by <a>Quaker</a>s &#x2014; <a>Swarthmore College</a> and <a>Haverford College</a>.
The school has an enrollment of about 1300 <a>undergraduate student</a>s and 450 <a>graduate student</a>s.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bryn Mawr College was founded in 1885, and named after the town of Bryn Mawr, which had been named by a representative of the Pennsylvania Railroad who found the name in some old records.
Bryn Mawr was the name of an area estate granted to Rowland Ellis by William Penn in the 1680s.
Ellis' former home, also called Bryn Mawr, was a house near <a>Dolgellau</a>, Merionnydd (Merioneth) <a>Gwynedd</a>, <a>Wales</a>.
The College was largely founded through the bequest of <a>Joseph W. Taylor</a>, and its first president was <a>James Evans Rhoads</a>.
Bryn Mawr was the first higher education institution to offer graduate degrees, including <a>doctorate</a>s, to women.
The first class included 36 undergraduate women and eight graduate students.
Bryn Mawr was originally affiliated with the <a>Religious Society of Friends</a> (Quakers), but by 1893 had become non-denominational.</p>
<p>The College will celebrate its 125th anniversary of &quot;bold vision, for women, for the world&quot; during the 2010-2011 academic year.[<a>http://news.brynmawr.edu/?p=5380</a>]
In September 2010, Bryn Mawr will host an international conference on issues of educational access, equity, and opportunity in secondary schools and universities in the United States and around the world.
[<a>http://www.brynmawr.edu/125th/conference/</a>]
Other festivities planned for the anniversary year include publication of a commemorative book on 125 years of student life, [<a>http://www.brynmawr.edu/125th/book/</a>]
and, in partnership with the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program <a>Mural Arts Program</a>, creation of a mural in West Philadelphia highlighting advances in women's education.

<p>In 1912, Bryn Mawr became the first college in the <a>United States</a> to offer doctorates in <a>social work</a>, through the Department of Social Economy and Social Research.
This department became the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research in 1970.
In 1931, Bryn Mawr began accepting men as graduate students, while remaining women-only at the undergraduate level.</p>
<p>From 1921 to 1938 the Bryn  Mawr campus was home to the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers, which was founded as part of the labor education movement and the women's labor movement.
The school taught women workers political economy, science, and literature, as well as organizing many extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>A June 3, 2008 article in <em><a>The New York Times</a></em> discussed the move by <a>women's colleges in the United States</a> to promote their schools in the <a>Middle East</a>.
The article noted that in doing so, the schools promote the work of graduates of women's colleges such as <a>Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, <a>Emily Dickinson</a>, <a>Diane Sawyer</a>, <a>Katharine Hepburn</a> (Bryn Mawr Class of 1928) and <a>Madeleine Albright</a>.
The Dean of Admissions of Bryn Mawr noted, &quot;We still prepare a disproportionate number of women scientists [...] We&#x2019;re really about the empowerment of women and enabling women to get a top-notch education.&quot;
The article also contrasted the difference between women's colleges in the Middle East and &quot;the American colleges [which] for all their white-glove history and academic prominence, are liberal strongholds where students fiercely debate political action, gender identity and issues like &#x201c;<a>heteronormativity</a>,&#x201d; the marginalizing of standards that are other than heterosexual.
Middle Eastern students who already attend these colleges tell of a transition that can be jarring.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1918, Bryn Mawr College was a mysterious <a>&quot;influenza escape&quot;</a> community, having 110 cases of influenza, but zero deaths.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Campus entrance</a> <a>right|thumb|Bryn Mawr's Pembroke Hall</a> Bryn Mawr's library holdings are housed in the Mariam Coffin Canaday Library (opened 1970), the Rhys Carpenter Library (opened 1997), and the Lois and Reginald Collier Science Library (opened 1993).
TRIPOD, the online library catalog, automatically accesses holdings at Haverford and Swarthmore.
</p>
<p>The majority of Bryn Mawr students live on campus in residence halls.
Many of the older residence halls were designed by <a>Cope &amp; Stewardson</a> and are known for their <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture, modeled after <a>Cambridge University</a>.
Each is named after a <a>county town</a> in <a>Wales</a>: <a>Brecon</a>, <a>Denbigh</a> (1891), Merion (1885), and <a>Radnor</a> (1887).
Pembroke East and West (1892).
Rhoads North and South was named after the college's first president, James E. Rhoads; Rockefeller is named after its donor, <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>.
The newest residence halls are Erdman (opened 1965, designed by architect <a>Louis Kahn</a>) and the Haffner Language and Culture House (opened 1971).
In addition, students may choose to live in Perry House (the Black Cultural Center) or Batten House (an environmentally-friendly co-op).
Glenmede (formerly graduate student housing) is an estate located about a half mile from the main campus which was available housing for undergraduate students.
In 2007, it was sold to a conservation buyer as the annual costs of upkeep were too great for the college.
</p>
<p>The campus was designed in part by noted landscape designers <a>Calvert Vaux</a> and <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, and has subsequently been designated an <a>arboretum</a> (the <a>Bryn Mawr Campus Arboretum</a>).</p>
<h3>Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden</h3>
<p>In 1908, <a>John C. Olmsted</a> designed a private garden for <a>M.
Carey Thomas</a> adjoining the Deanery.
The garden was later modified and renamed as the Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden.
It currently exists as a small, serene enclosure with two wall fountains, one with a small basin and the other with a sunken reflecting pool, as well as a statuary based on designs Thomas and Garrett had seen in Italy.
The decorative wall tiles, placed above the smaller wall fountain and basin, were purchased from <a>Syria</a>.</p>
<h3>Erdman Hall Dormitory</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Erdman Hall</a> In 1960, architect <a>Louis I. Kahn</a> and Bryn Mawr College president, <a>Katharine McBride</a>, came together to create the Erdman Hall dormitory.</p>
<p>For over a year, Kahn and his assistants struggled to translate the college&#x2019;s design program of 130 student rooms and public spaces into a scheme (well documented by the letters written between McBride and Kahn).
The building comprises three geometrical square structures, connected at their corners.
The outer walls are formed by interlocking student rooms around three inner public spaces: the entry hall, dining hall and living hall.
These spaces receive light from towering light monitors.</p>
<h3>The Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Sunset over Goodhart Hall</a> The Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater houses a vaulted <a>auditorium</a> designed by <a>Arthur Meigs</a>, two smaller spaces that are ideal for intimate performances by visiting artists, practice rooms for student musicians, and the Office for the Arts.
The building's towers and <a>gables</a>, <a>friezes</a>, carvings and ornamental ironwork were designed by <a>Samuel Yellin</a> in the <a>gothic revival</a> style.
In the fall of 2009, the College completed a $19 million renovation of Goodhart, which included expanded stage and rehearsal space, updated sound and lighting, a teaching theater, and renovated seating for audiences.</p>
<h3>M.
Carey Thomas Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Great Hall</a>  <a>thumb|Cloisters</a> <a>thumb|Rockefeller Hall</a> Named after Bryn Mawr's first Dean and second president, the M. Carey Thomas Library was used as a <a>library</a> until 1970, when Mariam Coffin Canaday Library opened.
Today, it is a space for performances, readings, lectures, and public gatherings.
It was once the home of the <a>Athena Lemnia</a> statue (which was damaged in 1997) which is now located in a high alcove in the Rhys Carpenter Art and Archaeology Library.
(A papier-m&#x00e2;ch&#x00e9; cast of that Athena now stands in her stead at the Great Hall.)
The Great Hall (formerly the reading room of the old Library) was designed by Walter Cope (of <a>Cope and Stewardson</a>) in 1901 and built by Stewardson and Jamieson several years later, although <a>M.
Carey Thomas</a> played a large part in its construction, particularly by taking photographs and doing architectural research on the Library's <a>University of Oxford</a> inspirations, as well as having a determination that would keep the Library's construction survive many hardships, such as Cope's death and financial trouble.
Built with <a>ashlar</a> gray stone and lined with <a>coffered</a> oak paneling, the Great Hall was inspired by the dining hall at <a>Wadham College, Oxford</a> and features a <a>king post truss</a> ceiling painted by Lockwood de Forest with geometric <a>Renaissance</a> patterns that continue down the wall, ending with tulip-bordered <a>corbels</a> that lie in between large, arch-shaped lead-paned windows, which flood the space with light.
The windows' tracery is also modeled after Wadham College's dining hall, though is absent of Wadham's <a>stained glass</a>.
This area was renovated and conserved by Voith &amp; Mactavish Architects LLP.
Carey Thomas asked Cope specifically, do not &quot;copy the interior plan at any other college, as it was a plan worked out by us at Bryn Mawr for us own individual needs and so far as he and I knew absolutely unique.&quot;</p>
<p>M.
Carey Thomas Library encloses a large open courtyard called &quot;The <a>Cloisters</a>&quot;, which is the site of the College's traditional Lantern Night ceremony.
The <a>cremated</a> remains of M. Carey Thomas and <a>Emmy Noether</a> are in the courtyard cloister.
Alumna <a>Katharine Hepburn</a> used to go <a>skinny dipping</a> in the Cloisters fountain, a fact confirmed by the source in her 1985 graduation address.
A popular <a>tradition</a> is for undergraduates to do the same before graduating and conveniently the fountain contains <a>chlorinated</a> water.</p>
<h3>Rhys Carpenter Art and Archaeology Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Rhoads Hall</a> Named for Bryn Mawr&#x2019;s late professor of Classical <a>Archaeology</a>, the Rhys Carpenter Library was designed by <a>Henry Myerberg</a> of New York and opened in 1997.
The space is attached to the rear of the M. Carey Thomas Library.
The entrance is a four story <a>atrium</a>.
Names of art and archaeology faculty are on the main wall with a <a>frieze</a> of plaster casts from ancient <a>Athens</a>.
Most of the stacks, study areas, lecture halls and seminar rooms were built underground.
The roof comprises a wide grassy area used for outdoor concerts and picnics.
The building won a 2001 Award of Excellence for Library Architecture from the Library Administration and Management Association and the American Institute of Architects.
Carpenter Library also houses the College's renowned collections in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology, History of Art and Classics.
The building also contains a large lecture hall and a seminar room.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Bryn Mawr undergraduates largely govern themselves in academic and social matters via the Self-Governance Association.
A significant aspect of self-government is the Academic Honor System (<a>honor code</a>).
The Honor Code is a set of principles that stress mutual respect and academic integrity.
Students ratify the code each year, agree to adhere to it, and enforce its provisions.</p>
<p>Along with <a>Haverford College</a>, Bryn Mawr forms the Bi-College Community.
Students in the &quot;Bi-Co&quot; enjoy unlimited cross-registration privileges and may choose to major at the other institution.
The two institutions join with <a>Swarthmore College</a> to form the Tri-College Consortium, opening the Swarthmore course catalog to interested Bryn Mawr students as well.
Free shuttles are provided between the three campuses.
There is the Blue Bus between Bryn Mawr and Haverford College, and a van, known to the students as the &quot;Swat Van&quot;, that travels among the three colleges.
</p>
<p>In addition, the College is affiliated with the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> through a special association known as the <a>Quaker Consortium</a>, allowing Bryn Mawr students to take classes there.
Additionally, Bryn Mawr students in the Growth and Structure of Cities department may earn a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> at Bryn Mawr and a <a>master's degree</a> in <a>city planning</a> at Penn through the 3-2 Program in City and Regional Planning.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Bryn Mawr is a small, four year, highly residential baccalaureate college.
Although the college offers several graduate programs, the majority of enrollments are from students enrolled in the undergraduate arts &amp; sciences program.
The college granted 331 bachelor's degrees, 106 master's degrees, and 21 doctoral degrees in 2009.</p>
<p>Students at Bryn Mawr are required to complete divisional requirements in the <a>social sciences</a>, <a>natural sciences</a> (including lab skills) and <a>humanities</a>.
In addition, they must fulfill a two-year <a>foreign language</a> requirement, a quantitative skills requirement and a College Seminar requirement.
</p>
<p>Admission to Bryn Mawr is classified as &quot;more selective, lower transfer in.&quot;</p>

<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>Bryn Mawr has signed the American College and University President's Climate Commitment, and in doing so, the school agreed to make all new buildings comply with a LEED silver standard or higher; to purchase Energy Star products whenever possible; and to provide and encourage the use of public transportation.
The school's dining halls strive to be environmentally sustainable by working to expand their local and organic offerings, recycling in all dining areas, and recycling used fry oil as bio-diesel fuel.
The dining halls previously offered biodegradable takeout containers, but reverted to Styrofoam in the 2009/10 academic year.
Additionally, all leftover food is donated to a local food bank.
On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Bryn Mawr received a C+.
The school's highest category score was an A in Investment Priorities, since Bryn Mawr invests in renewable energy funds, but the score was brought down by lower grades in categories like Green Building (in which the school earned a D, since the campus currently features no green buildings).</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Bryn Mawr fields intercollegiate teams in badminton, basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, rowing, rugby, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.
The badminton team won national intercollegiate championships in 1996 and 2008.</p>
