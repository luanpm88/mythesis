<p> </p>
<p><strong>Connecticut College</strong> (<strong>Conn College</strong> or <strong>Conn</strong>) is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>New London</a>, <a>Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>The college was founded in 1911 in response to <a>Wesleyan University</a> closing its doors to women.
The campus is located on the <a>Thames River</a>, overlooking the <a>Long Island Sound</a> on the highest point in New London.
It is a member of the <a>New England Small College Athletic Conference</a> (NESCAC), and is considered to be among the group of colleges called the &quot;<a>Little Ivies</a>.&quot;
<em><a>Forbes</a></em> ranked Connecticut College 83 in its America's Best Colleges list in 2010 and <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranked the school in its top fifty liberal arts colleges in 2010.
</p>
<p>Known for its interdisciplinary academic centers, Connecticut College is in the midst of a major fundraising and building campaign.
Over the past several years the college has renovated many of its older dormitories, completed numerous classroom renovations, and constructed a new fitness center.
The college is in the final planning stages of a new life science and computer science center, an international commons, and is continuing to renovate the remainder of its older dormitories and classroom spaces.</p>
<p>Connecticut College's fourth strategic plan (2004) introduced the College's new <a>mission statement</a>: &quot;Connecticut College educates students to put the liberal arts into action as citizens in a global society.&quot;</p>
<h2>History and overview</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Harkness Chapel at sunset</a> <a>thumb|left|Harkness House</a></p>
<p>Chartered in 1911, the founding of the college was a response to <a>Wesleyan University</a>'s decision to stop admitting women.
Female Wesleyan alumnae, notably Elizabeth C. Wright, convinced others to found this new college, espousing the increasing desire amongst women for higher education.
Several large gifts of land gave the college its hilltop location overlooking <a>Long Island Sound</a>.
Financial assistance from the city of <a>New London</a>, its residents, and a number of wealthy benefactors gave the college its initial endowment.
According to an Oct. 12, 1935 article in the <em>Hartford Daily Times</em>, marking the College's 20th anniversary:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;On September 27, 1915, on this beautiful site, the college opened its doors to students.
The entering class was made up of 99 freshmen students, candidates for degrees, and 52 special students, a total registration of 151.
A fine faculty of 23 members had been engaged and a library of 6,000 volumes had been gathered together.
It was an auspicious start for this new undertaking.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connecticut College has been continuously accredited since 1932 by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.
In a typical year, the College enrolls about 1,900 men and women from 40-45 states, Washington D.C., and 70 countries.
Approximately forty percent of students are men.
The College is now particularly known for <a>interdisciplinary studies</a>, international programs and <a>study abroad</a>, funded internships, student-faculty research, <a>service learning</a>, and shared governance.
Under the College's system of shared governance, faculty, staff, students, and administrators are represented on the major committees that make policy regarding the curriculum, the budget, and the campus and facilities.</p>
<p>Students live under the College's 84-year-old student-adjudicated <a>Honor Code</a> and without a <a>Greek system</a>.
The Honor Code, which distinguishes Connecticut College from its peers, underpins all academic and social interactions at the College and creates a palpable spirit of trust and cooperation between students and faculty.
Other manifestations of the Code include self-scheduled, unproctored final exams.</p>
<p>According to The Princeton Review 2005 and Campus Compact, Connecticut College is one of the nation&#x2019;s best colleges for fostering social responsibility and public service.
A <a>January 2006 ranking</a> noted that Connecticut College is among the 25 top small colleges in terms of the number of graduates who serve in the <a>Peace Corps</a>.</p>
<p>Connecticut College is a member of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, the <a>Annapolis Group</a>, and the <a>New England Small College Athletic Conference</a> (<a>NESCAC</a>).</p>
<p>A reciprocal exchange agreement with the <a>United States Coast Guard</a>, allows cadets from the nearby <a>USCG Academy</a> to take some courses at the college, while Connecticut College students may take courses at the Academy.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The College's First-Year Seminar Program provides student-faculty engagement in a small, intellectually stimulating setting in their first semester.
</p>
<p>Connecticut College has four Interdisciplinary Centers that administer certificate programs, plus a fifth center that facilitates the teaching and researching of race and ethnicity across the curriculum.
If accepted into one of the College's four certificate programs, students of any major complete a self-designed series of courses that relate to their academic interest, complete a College-funded summer internship, and complete an integrative project in their senior year.
These four centers routinely attract the College's best students and are a model for the kinds of integrated educational pathways the College offers its students.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ammerman Center for Arts and Technology</strong> (CAT) Through the Ammerman Center, faculty and students can shape the study, use and creation of new technologies, probe the forefront of their fields and work in new markets with innovative products.</li>
<li><strong>Toor Cummings Center for International Studies and the Liberal Arts</strong> (CISLA) The CISLA mission is to encourage students to become public intellectuals: those who are politically concerned, socially engaged, and culturally sensitive and informed.
CISLA prepares them to internationalize their majors and become responsible citizens in a global community.</li>
<li><strong>Holleran Center for Community Action and Public Policy</strong> (PICA) The Holleran Center orchestrates College and community resources to build on assets, respond to needs, and facilitate community revitalization and problem solving.</li>

<li>Students' classroom learning at Connecticut College is supplemented by a wide variety of service learning courses and volunteer work in the New London area.
Many of these opportunities are coordinated by the Office of Volunteers for Community Service.
OVCS facilitates student involvement in the community by running a van shuttle service, which transports students to and from sites in the area.</li>
<li>Connecticut College has a history of undergraduate research work and students are encouraged to make conference presentations and publish their work under the guidance of a professor.</li>
