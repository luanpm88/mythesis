<p>The <strong>University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus</strong> (2.945 N, 101.874
E) was established in 2000 as the <a>Malaysia</a> campus of the <a>University of Nottingham</a>, <a>UK</a>, making it the first purpose-built UK university campus in a foreign country.
Formerly known as the <strong>University of Nottingham in Malaysia Sdn Bhd</strong>  or <strong>UNiM</strong>, this term is now reserved for the holding company.
The campus' chairman is <a>YM Tengku Tan Sri Ahmad Rithauddeen</a>, a Nottingham graduate and former Malaysian Defence Minister.</p>
<p>Facilities include a purpose built sports facility, students association building, food court as well as shops.
Students also have 24 hour access to computer facilities.
Wifi is available throughout the campus, with the exception of the residential halls in which students are provided with free LAN access.</p>
<p>The University's  campus is situated in <a>Semenyih</a> at <a>Selangor</a> state, 30&nbsp;km South of Kuala Lumpur costing over RM120million (U$D33million).
The majority shareholder of University of Nottingham in Malaysia Sdn Bhd is <a>Boustead Group</a>.
It was officially opened by Najib Tun Razak (Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia on 26 September 2005 and an alumnus.)
The University was previously situated in the heart of <a>Kuala Lumpur</a> in the Wisma MISC building on Jalan Conlay, and a presence is still retained at the central Kuala Lumpur location.</p>
<p>Currently, as of 2009, the university has around 2900 students with a large number of foreign students from over 50 different countries.
The campus has grown considerably since the official opening in 2005, with construction of a new Research Building, Teaching Building, 2 Accommodation Blocks and expansion of the Student Association Building.</p>
<p>The Malaysia Campus offers courses in Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Communications, Law and Pharmacy, Applied Psychology, Civil Engineering, Education and Plant Bio-Technology.
Upon completing a degree at the Malaysia campus, students are awarded a University of Nottingham degree certificate which is indistinguishable from the certificates awarded at the Nottingham campus.
The degrees that are awarded are accredited by international professional bodies such as the Association of MBA's and the UK Engineering Council.</p>
<p>Apart from taught undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the university also offers a full range of projects available for research-based postgraduate studies leading either to MPhil or PhD.
More than 20 research programmes are currently being carried out at the Malaysia Campus.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Faculty of Engineering and Computer Sciences</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science was established at the Malaysia Campus in August 2005 to coincide with the move to the new campus at Semenyih.
All programmes can be completed solely in Malaysia, but an option is also open to students whereby they can complete the 2nd year of their respective degrees at the Nottingham campus in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>The faculty consists of five main schools: School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, School of Civil Engineering, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, and the School of Computer Science and Information Technology.
There is also a Foundation Studies division that offers foundation programmes specific to the engineering sciences.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Health and Biological Sciences</h3>
<p>There are two main schools within the faculty: School of Pharmacy, and School of Biosciences.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the School of Pharmacy is the only school outside of the UK accredited by the <a>RPSGB</a>, allowing graduates to practice within the UK without further qualification.
The Malaysia Campus' <a>MPharm</a> Degree also allows practice within Malaysia itself and the neighbouring Singapore.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Social Sciences and Education</h3>
<p>There are four main schools that make up this faculty: Nottingham University Business School Malaysia, School of Law, School of Applied Psychology, and School of Education.
Similarly with the Faculty of Engineering, there exists a special foundation studies division that offers pre-university foundation programmes.</p>
