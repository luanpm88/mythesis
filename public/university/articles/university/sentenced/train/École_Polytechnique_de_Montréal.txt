<p>  The <strong>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique de Montr&#x00e9;al</strong> is an engineering school in <a>Montreal</a>, <a>Quebec</a>.
It is occasionally referred to as Montreal Polytechnic, although in <a>Canadian English</a> its French name is more commonly used.
Founded in 1873, it is affiliated with the <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al</a>.
The school offers <a>graduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> training, and is very active in research.
Following the tradition, new <a>bachelors of engineering</a> (B.
Eng.) graduating from the &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique get the <a>Iron Ring</a>, following the Canadian <a>Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer</a>.</p>
<h2>Enrolment</h2>
<p>The enrolment for 2007 was 3,929 undergraduate and 1,615 <a>graduate students</a> and 220 staff.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|View of the north face of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal </a> --&gt; The school is on the campus of the Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al located on the northern face of <a>Mount Royal</a>.
Its main building is the highest on campus.
The <em>J.-Armand-Bombardier</em> building sits beside the main building and mainly serves for research activities and as an emergence centre for spin-off companies, designed to support the pre-startup of technology-based businesses.
This building is named after <a>Joseph-Armand Bombardier</a>, the inventor of the <a>snowmobile</a>.</p>
<p>The  <em>Pierre-Lassonde et Claudette-Mackay-Lassonde</em> building, home to the Electrical Engineering Department and Computer Engineering Department, was inaugurated in September 2005.
This new building won a &quot;Award of Merit&quot; from <em>Canadian Architect</em> magazine in 2003, got a Gold certification from the <a>U.S. Green Building Council</a> and scored 46 at the <a>LEED</a> points scale which was, at inauguration, the highest score ever obtained in Canada.
The energy performance of the Lassonde buildings is 60% better than the standard set by the Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings.</li>

<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique is one of the three biggest engineering schools in <a>Canada</a>, and the largest in the province of <a>Quebec</a>.
Since its foundation in 1873, this <a>French language</a> educational establishment trains highly skilled <a>engineer</a>s and specialists and contributes to the scientific and economic expansion of the region.
Its graduates were part of most of Quebec's major engineering works of the 20th century such as the construction of <a>hydroelectric dams</a>.
The &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique is now one of the <a>avant-garde</a> of engineering in such fields as <a>aeronautics</a>, <a>computer engineering</a>, <a>telecommunications</a>, <a>biotechnology</a>, <a>nanotechnology</a>, <a>environmental science</a>, <a>artificial intelligence</a>, and many other high-end domains.</p>
<p>There are 13 undergraduate programs offered by 7 departments.
Some are coop programs.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique is known for its dynamic research, representing 35% of its budget for the year 1998&#x2013;1999 (26.9 million CAD $).
Forty research units receive more than 20% of the funding and contracts for research in the area of <a>applied science</a> given to Quebec&#x2019;s universities.</p>
<h2>Students and faculty</h2>
<p>There were 5713 students enrolled for the winter 2003 semester.
Of them, 1198 were women and 4515 were men.
There were 3997 undegraduates and 1716 graduate students.</p>
<p>220 teachers and 150 researchers are part of the school's community.
Well-known for the quality of the teaching, approximately 600 diplomas, 200 masters, and 50 doctorates are awarded each year.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>It is well known for its vivid student life, including its theater group <a>Poly-Th&#x00e9;&#x00e2;tre</a> and photo club  <a>Poly-Photo</a>.
Many other committees are present, such as Allo-Poly (humor), Poly-TV, Polyrad, etc.
Its student newspaper,  <a>Le Polyscope</a> was Founded in 1967.
It publishes weekly during the Quebec school year.
It is known around the campus of the Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al for its irreverent humour, crosswords puzzles, Arts &amp; Entertainment section and &quot;you submit it, we'll publish it&quot; policy.
The &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique is also well known in Montreal for its beach party, organised by the student committee known as Poly-Party.
It takes place once every two years in winter (generally in January).
Students build a complete &quot;artificial beach&quot; in the cafeteria, by putting loads of sand on the floor and assembling an interior water park with a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>Also, each year, the <a>Poly-World</a> student missions visits another country to learn and compare foreign engineering practices.
This extracurricular activity helps participating students learn different <a>cultural</a> visions and helps them appreciate the different factors of <a>global</a> <a>competitiveness</a> in the engineering field.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of student committees, technical societies and social activities is available on <a>Polytechnique's &quot;Student life&quot; website</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole Polytechnique de Montr&#x00e9;al (a reference to the famous <a>&#x00c9;cole polytechnique</a> in <a>Paris</a>) was founded in 1873 in order to teach <a>technical drawing</a> and other useful arts.
At first, it was set in a converted residence.
It later moved to a larger building on Saint-Denis Street.
In 1958, it moved to its current location on the Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al campus.
The original building was enlarged in 1975 and then in 1989.
In 2002, the Computer and Electrical Engineering Department (they were later separated) began to occupy the 5th and 6th floor of the old <a>&#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales de Montr&#x00e9;al</a> building.
In 2003, the construction of three new buildings started.</p>
<p>Until the 1960s, the main purpose of the school was to train engineers.
However, from 1959 on, the focus went to research.
Nowadays, it is a leading research institution in applied sciences in Canada.</p>
<p>On December 6, 1989, it was the site of the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique massacre</a>, in which 14 women  were killed by <a>Marc L&#x00e9;pine</a>.</p>
