<p>The <strong>University of Tartu</strong> (, ) is a classical <a>university</a> in the city of <a>Tartu</a>, <a>Estonia</a>.
University of Tartu is the national university of Estonia; it is the biggest and highest-ranked university in Estonia.
The University of Tartu is a member of the <a>Coimbra Group</a> and was established by King <a>Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden</a> in 1632, thus being one of the oldest universities in the region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Academia Gustaviana</h3>
<p>The <em>Academia Gustaviana</em> in the then Swedish province of <a>Livonia</a> was the second university founded in the <a>Swedish Empire</a>, following <a>Uppsala University</a> (in <a>Uppsala</a>, Sweden proper) and preceding the <a>Academy of &#x00c5;bo</a> (in <a>Turku</a>, <a>Finland</a>).
A precursor to the academy had been a <a>Jesuit</a> grammar school <em>Gymnasium Dorpatense</em>, founded by <a>Stefan Batory</a> (then king of <a>Poland</a>) in 1583 and existing to 1601, when Tartu (Dorpat) was under <a>Polish</a> rule.</p>
<p>The first students immatriculated between 20&#x2013;21 April 1632.
The opening ceremony of Academia Dorpatensis (Academia Gustaviana) took place on 15 October in the same year.
The academy in Tartu functioned with Philosophy, Law, Theology and Medical Faculties enjoying the privileges of the University of Uppsala.
On account of the Russian&#x2013;Swedish war the University of Tartu moved to <a>Tallinn</a> in 1656 and in 1665 it closed down.
In the 17th century the future outstanding Swedish scientists <a>Urban Hi&#x00e4;rne</a>, <a>Olof Verelius</a>, <a>Arvid Moller</a> and others studied at the university.
Among the academic staff were <a>Friedrich Menius</a>, the professor of history (the history of <a>Livonia</a>, the first scientific approach to Estonian folklore); <a>Sven Dimberg</a>, the professor of mathematics (the first in the world to deliver lectures based on Newton&#x2019;s theory); <a>Olaus Hermelin</a>, the professor of rhetoric and poetry; <a>Lars Micrander</a>, the professor of medicine (the founder of <a>balneology</a>, the discoverer of natural mineral water springs).
In 1690 Tartu became a university town again.
Academia Gustavo-Carolina shortly after that moved from Tartu to P&#x00e4;rnu as a result of the coalition against Sweden and the Great Famine of 1695&#x2013;1697.
Academia Gustavo-Carolina which had opened in P&#x00e4;rnu on 28 August 1699 was closed because of the surrender to the Russian forces on 12 August 1710 during the Northern War.
According to the terms of the capitulation act the Russians agreed to maintain the university in P&#x00e4;rnu.
The university was reopened only in 1802 by the <a>Baltic German</a> <em>Ritterschaften</em> under the reform-minded Emperor <a>Alexander I</a> of <a>Russia</a>, to which Livonia then belonged.</p>
<h3>Universit&#x00e4;t Dorpat</h3>

[[File:UT Botanical Garden1 2008.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens|Botanical Garden]] was founded by <a>Gottfried Albrecht Germann</a> in 1803.]]
The University was re-opened by the <a>Baltic German</a>s in Estonia in 1802.
The language of instruction at Dorpat was <a>German</a> from 1802 to 1893.
During that time, Dorpat had a dual nature in that it belonged both to the set of German(-language) and Russian universities.
Financially and administratively, the latter was more important; intellectually and regarding the professoriate and students, the former was more important (over half the professors came from <a>Germany</a>, at least another third were <a>Baltic Germans</a>).
Among the 30 German-language universities, of which 23 were inside the <a>German Empire</a>, Dorpat was the 11th in size.
In teaching, the university educated the local <a>Baltic German</a> leadership and professional classes as well as staff especially for the administration and health system of the entire <a>Russian Empire</a>.
In scholarship, it was an international university; the time between 1860 and 1880 was its <em>&quot;golden age&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>The freedom to be a half-German university ceased with the rise of nationalist tendencies in Russia, which held homogenization more important than retaining a bi-lingual university.
Between 1882 and 1898, <a>Russification</a> in language, appointments, etc., was imposed, with some exceptions (such as the Divinity School, which the state feared would be used by the <a>Orthodox</a> clergy to teach dangerous <a>Protestant</a> views and was thus was allowed to continue in German until 1916).
By 1898, when both the town and the university were renamed Yuryev, virtually all distinguished scholars from Germany had left.
The University of Yuryev existed until 1918, when during part of the fall term, it was reopened, under <a>German occupation</a>, as Dorpat.
Russian academic staff and students took refuge in <a>Voronezh</a> in Russia, giving rise to the foundation of <a>Voronezh State University</a>, which traces its own history back to the foundation of the University of Tartu and still holds several physical properties of the latter.</p>
<h3>University of Tartu (1919&#x2013;)</h3>

After Estonia became independent in 1918, the University of Tartu has been an <a>Estonian-language</a> institution since 1919.
The university was named Ostland-Universit&#x00e4;t in Dorpat during the <a>German occupation</a> of Estonia in 1941&#x2013;1944 and Tartu State University (Estonian: <em>Tartu Riiklik &#x00dc;likool</em>) in 1940&#x2013;1941 and 1944&#x2013;1989, during the <a>Soviet occupation</a>.
During Soviet rule, although Estonian remained the principal language of instruction, some courses were taught in Russian, and there were several Russian curricula.
Estonia regained independence in 1991, and the full recovery of academic autonomy of the University can be dated to 1992.</p>
<p>The last decade has been marked by organizational and structural changes, as well as adaptations to various university models (American, Scandinavian, German) against the background of the Soviet and Baltic German past.
Most recently, the university has been and is still being marked by the adaptation of the <a>Bologna declaration</a> in Estonia generally and Tartu specifically, leading to major changes in curricula and studies, as well as by strong organizational centralization attempts.
Recent plans also include the abolition of the Chair system (an Americanization) and of the Faculties, which is supposed to lead to four large divisions (Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Medicine) under briefly serving deans and rector-appointed financial administrators.</p>
<h2>Buildings</h2>
<p><a>thumb|UT sports site</a> &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EST2b.jpg|thumb|On
an Estonian [[2 Krooni|2 Kroon]] bill]] --&gt; The university&#x2019;s four museums, its <a>Botanical Gardens</a>, and sports facilities are, by and large, open to the general public.
The University possesses some 150 buildings, 30 of which are outside of Tartu.
31 of its buildings decorate the city as architectural monuments.
However, the current reforms include attempts to sell, or have the state co-sponsor, several of these buildings and monuments, as well as sports facilities, as they are not seen as part of the university's mission proper.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are numerous recently constructed/renovated university buildings and student dormitories, such as the Technology Institute and the Biomedical Center.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>[[File:Wilhelm Ostwald.jpg|thumb|upright|The
[[Baltic German]] chemist <a>Wilhelm Ostwald</a> received the <a>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 1909.]]
<a>Lectin</a>ology, the science of <a>lectin</a>s was founded at the University of Tartu in <a>1888</a> with the publication of <a>Peter Hermann Stillmark</a>'s thesis about the isolation of <a>Ricin</a>.</p>
<p>At the University of Tartu, currently more than 3,300 scientific publications are produced every year.
About half of all publications by Estonian scientists in journals (those covered by citation indexes like &quot;SCI Expanded&quot;, &quot;SSCI&quot; or &quot;A&amp;HCI&quot;) are written by Tartu authors.
</p>
<p>According to the university administration, the most remarkable recent research achievements have been in the fields of <a>molecular</a> and <a>cell biology</a>, <a>gene</a> <a>technology</a>, <a>immunology</a>, <a>pharmacology</a>, <a>laser</a> <a>medicine</a>, <a>materials science</a>, <a>laser spectroscopy</a>, <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>environmental technology</a>, <a>computational linguistics</a>, <a>psychology</a>, and <a>semiotics</a>.</p>
<p>The university cooperates with private enterprises, and acts itself as a nucleus for the development of <a>spin-off</a> firms (examples from recent past include Asper Biotech and others).</p>
