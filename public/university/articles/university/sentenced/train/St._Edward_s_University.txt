<p>  <strong>St.
Edward's University</strong> is a private <a>Roman Catholic</a> institution of higher learning located south of <a>Lady Bird Lake</a> in <a>Austin, Texas</a>.
The university offers a <a>liberal arts</a> education and its campus is located on a hill overlooking the city of <a>Austin</a>.
The campus's most notable landmark is Main Building.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>St.
Edward's University was founded by the Rev. <a>Edward Sorin</a>, CSC , Superior General of the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a>, who also founded the <a>University of Notre Dame</a> in <a>Indiana</a>.
Father Sorin established the institution on farmland south of <a>Austin</a> in 1878 and named it St.
Edward's Academy in honor of his patron saint, <a>Edward the Confessor and King</a>.
It is affiliated with the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a>.</p>
<p>In 1885, the president, the Rev. P.J. Franciscus, strengthened the prestige of the academy by securing a charter, changing its name to St. Edward's College, assembling a faculty, and increasing enrollment.
Subsequently, St. Edward's began to grow, and the first school newspaper, the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to erect an administration building all followed.
Well-known architect <a>Nicholas J. Clayton</a> of <a>Galveston, Texas</a> was commissioned to design the college's Main Building.
The structure was built four-stories tall in the <a>Gothic Revival</a> style and was constructed with local <a>white limestone</a>.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1903, a mysterious fire destroyed the majority of Main Building, but it was rebuilt by the fall.
In 1922, Main Building sustained damage from a tornado that caused significant damage all over the campus.
Main Building was added to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973.</p>
<p>In 1925, St. Edward's received its university charter.
Most of the personnel at the time were <a>Holy Cross</a> Priests and Brothers.
Women arrived at St. Edward's in 1966 as students for Maryhill College, a coordinate institution.
By 1970, Maryhill was absorbed and St. Edward's became co-educational.</p>
<p>By 1971, the university carried bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration.
Also added were the College Assistance Migrant Program, or CAMP (1972); a professionally oriented Theater Arts curriculum (1972); an innovative degree program for adults called New College (1974); and Freshman Studies (1975).</p>
<p>In 1984, Patricia Hayes became the first woman and only the second <a>layperson</a> to lead St. Edward's University.
In 1990, enrollment reached 3,000 for the first time.
This decade also ushered in a revised undergraduate curriculum, and capital and technological improvements.
</p>
<p>In 1999, George E. Martin became the 23rd president of St. Edward's University.</p>
<p>St.
Edward's has maintained a balanced operating budget &#x2014; currently more than $115 million &#x2014; and the university's endowment stands at more than $41 million.
Total university assets exceed $249 million.
Fundraising has grown each year as well, and 83% of faculty and staff contributed to the annual fund last year &#x2014; more than triple the giving levels of benchmark universities.</p>
<h3>Strategic plan beginnings</h3>
<p>In 2000, St. Edward&#x2019;s University, under the leadership of President George E. Martin and the Board of Trustees, identified seven strategic priorities to achieve its vision.
These include objectives for enrollment growth, faculty and staff recruitment and retention, curricular and co-curricular program development, facility and technology development, financial management, endowment growth, and marketing.</p>
<p>Progress on the priorities began immediately.
Enrollment has grown from 3,669 in Fall 1999 to nearly 5,300 in Fall 2009.
New academic programs have been added, including undergraduate majors in bioinformatics, criminology, entrepreneurship, forensic chemistry, nonprofit management and graphic design, as well as graduate programs in computer information systems, project management, teaching, and organizational leadership and rthics.
</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s strategic plan, which details how St. Edward&#x2019;s will construct new facilities while maintaining the overall architectural character of campus, supports the strategic priorities for academic excellence, enrollment growth, and recruiting and retaining the best students, faculty and staff.
</p>
<h4>Buildings completed under the 2010 strategic plan</h4>
<p>Trustee Hall, a  academic facility, was the first building completed under the plan.
It opened in Fall 2002.
The completion of <a>Basil Moreau</a> Residence Hall in 2003 and Jacques Dujari&#x00e9; Hall in 2005 further enhanced residence life.
</p>
<p>The John Brooks Williams Natural Sciences Center-North Building, a  facility that opened in Fall 2006, is the first phase of a two-building science complex and houses the biology and chemistry programs in the School of Natural Sciences.
A second phase, scheduled to open in 2012, will house the computer science, mathematics and physics programs.
</p>
<p>A 756-car parking garage opened in 2007 and offers convenient access to the heart of campus.</p>
<p>A new residential village, which opened in January 2009, evokes a sense of urban living in the heart of campus.
</p>
<p>Major renovations of existing campus buildings include Premont Hall (2006, Fleck Hall (2007) and Doyle Hall (2009).
</p>
<p>Plans for a new <a>chapel</a> are being drawn up by architect <a>Rick Joy</a>, winner of the 2004 National Design Award from the <a>Smithsonian Institution</a>&#x2019;s <a>Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum</a>.</p>
<h3>St.
Edward's celebrates 125 years</h3>
<p>In 2010, St. Edward&#x2019;s University completed its 10-year strategic plan under the leadership of President George E. Martin.
It also began a yearlong celebration of the university&#x2019;s 125-year anniversary.
To honor this anniversary, the university created the 125 Service Challenge, which encourages students, alumni, faculty and staff to participate in service around the community and help reach a collective goal of 75,000 service hours.
In October 2010, the university community is due to join together for a 125th birthday party complete with food, entertainment and birthday cake.</p>
