<p><strong>Queens College</strong>, located in <a>Flushing, Queens</a>, <a>New York City</a>, is one of the senior <a>college</a>s of the <a>City University of New York</a>.</p>
<h2>History and enrollment</h2>
<p>Before Queens College was established in 1937 to serve the needs of the growing borough's population, including newly arrived immigrant families, it was a home for delinquent boys.
Buildings, such as Jefferson Hall, which was named after President Thomas Jefferson, that were built using Spanish tiles were used as both dormitories and classrooms.
All of these buildings are connected by underground tunnels.
However, these tunnels are no longer used.
In 1934, the school for delinquent boys was shut down amid rumors of abuse.
Eventually QC's Colden Center would be named for the District Attorney that investigated the case.
The site was chosen when Mayor LaGuardia decided that Queens, like Brooklyn, also deserved to have a college.</p>
<p>Much as it does today, the college in its early years provided an affordable opportunity to New Yorkers who were eager for a quality education.
In 2006, Queens College had an enrollment of 18,107 including 13,662 undergraduates and 4,445 graduate students.
Students from 120 different countries speaking 66 different languages are enrolled at the school.
While it is widely known as a <a>liberal arts college</a>, Queens College is, in fact, a comprehensive college offering over 100 undergraduate and graduate degrees at the <a>master's</a> level as well as a number of advanced certificate programs.
Queens College itself does not grant doctoral degrees, but is part of the consortium of the <a>CUNY Graduate Center</a>, and is home to a variety of doctoral programs.
It is also one of seven participating schools in the CUNY Honors College, a recently inaugurated competitive program that offers exceptional students a full scholarship, a free laptop, and other benefits.
Upon choosing a home campus, these students are designated as University Scholars, and enroll in Honors Seminar courses for their first two years in addition to Queens College curriculum.
The department for <a>Continuing Education</a> offers non-credit courses and enrolls over 5,000 students.</p>
<h2>The campus and facilities</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|The QC Quad</a> The  campus, located off Kissena Boulevard, is on one of the highest points in the borough.
Six of the original Spanish style buildings dating back to the early 20th century still stand such as Jefferson Hall, which was built in 1900.
The college has since expanded to include over 40 buildings including the main classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, rebuilt in 2003 and named after the college's distinguished <a>anthropologist</a> <a>Hortense Powdermaker</a>.
This building is considered a &quot;smart&quot; building because it is fully wireless, each classroom has both audio and visual equipment, and because it is soundproof.</p>
<p>The Benjamin Rosenthal Library, with its soaring, light-filled atrium and distinctive clock tower, features innovations in information retrieval.
The college is also expanding its wireless capabilities, opening new caf&#x00e9;s and dining areas, installing plasma boards, updating the Student Union and several other buildings, and embarking on a variety of campus-beautification projects.

Built in 1988, the library contains 752,900 books, 32,600 print and electronic materials, the college archives, and a growing collection of multimedia materials in its Media Center.
The library is also home to the papers of <a>Robert Morris</a> and the <a>Louis Armstrong</a> archives.
The library also houses the art library and art center, which has approximately 70,000 books and 5,000 bound periodicals, as well as 15,000 slides, and the rare books collection.
The art center displays the works of both established and emerging artists in all media.
</p>
<p>The college is also home to the <a>Aaron Copland</a> School of Music located in the music building, constructed in 1991.
