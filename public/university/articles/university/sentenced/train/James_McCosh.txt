<p> <strong>James McCosh</strong> (April 1, 1811 &ndash; November 16, 1894) was a prominent <a>philosopher</a> of the <a>Scottish School of Common Sense</a>.
He was president of <a>Princeton University</a> 1868-1888.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>McCosh was born of a <a>Covenanting</a> family in <a>Ayrshire</a>, and studied at the Universities of <a>Glasgow</a> and <a>Edinburgh</a>, obtaining his M.A. at the latter, at the suggestion of Sir <a>William Hamilton</a>, for an essay on <a>stoicism</a>.
He became a minister of the Established <a>Church of Scotland</a> in 1834, serving as <a>pastor</a> first at <a>Arbroath</a> and then at <a>Brechin</a>.
He sided with the <a>Free Church of Scotland</a> in the <a>Disruption of 1843</a>, becoming minister at Brechin's new East Free Church.
In 1850 or 1851 he was appointed Professor of <a>Logic</a> and <a>Metaphysics</a> at <a>Queen's College, Belfast</a> (now <a>Queen's University Belfast</a>).</p>
<p>In 1868 he travelled to the <a>United States</a> to become president of the College of New Jersey (now <a>Princeton University</a>).
He resigned the presidency in 1888, but continued to teach philosophy until his death.
McCosh Hall (home of the English department) and a cross-campus walkway are named in his honor.
The campus infirmary is named after his wife, Isabella McCosh.
A school on the South Side of Chicago was named after him, but has since been renamed the <a>Emmett Louis Till</a> Math &amp; Science Academy.</p>
<h2>Philosophical work</h2>
<p>McCosh's position was mainly in the tradition of <a>Thomas Reid</a> and other Scottish common-sense philosophers.
He denied that our beliefs about the nature of the external world rest on causal or other inferences from perceptual ideas, but held that they are the direct accompaniments of sensation, and thus not open to question.
He also argued for the <em>a priori</em> nature of fundamental principles such as those of <a>causality</a> and <a>morality</a>.
Our judgements and other cognitions are regulated by such principles, though that is not to say that everyone is aware of them; they can be reached through reflection on our experience, when they are recognised as self-evidently necessary.
In his moral theory, especially, McCosh differed from many of his contemporaries in being relatively uninfluenced by Kant.</p>
<p>McCosh's most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile <a>evolution</a> and Christianity.
He argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in <a>divine design</a>, glorifies the divine designer (see for example his <em>Christianity and Positivism</em>).
This aspect of his work found popularity among evangelical clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy.</p>
<p>The debate between McCosh as president of the college and <a>Charles Hodge</a>, head of Princeton Seminary, during the late 1860s and 1870s exemplifyied the classic conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin's evolution theory.
McCosh offered the first public endorsement of evolution by an American religious leader.
However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated.
Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion.
The debate vitalized the college and helped propel the school to future recognition for excellence in scholarship.</p>
