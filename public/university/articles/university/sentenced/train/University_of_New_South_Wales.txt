<p><strong>The University of New South Wales (UNSW)</strong> (informally <strong>New South</strong>), is a <a>university</a> based in <a>Kensington</a>, a suburb in <a>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1949, it is recognised as one of Australia&#x2019;s leading teaching and research institutions, and has developed a strong reputation in a number of fields.
Graduates from the university are held in high regard by employers and receive some of the highest starting salaries in comparison to other universities in Australia.
As a result, greater than half of New South Wales' top <a>HSC</a> students each year consistently make UNSW their first preference, more than all other universities in the state combined.</p>
<p>UNSW currently has approximately 46,000 students studying in 600 undergraduate and postgraduate academic programs.
Over 5,000 full-time staff work in its 76 schools, 69 research centres, six institutes, four teaching hospitals, eight residential colleges and many administrative departments.</p>
<p>Aside from the main campus in Kensington, UNSW has many other campuses throughout Sydney, including the <a>COFA</a> campus in <a>Paddington</a>.

It is also the only Australian business school featured in the rankings for 7 consecutive years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|290px|University council's first meeting in 1949</a> The idea of founding the University originated from the crisis demands of <a>World War II</a>, during which the nation's attention was drawn to the critical role that <a>science</a> and <a>technology</a> played in transforming an <a>agricultural</a> society into a modern and industrial one.
The post-war <a>Labor government</a> of New South Wales recognised the increasing need to have a university specialised in training high quality <a>engineers</a> and technology-related professionals in numbers beyond that of the capacity and characteristics of the existing <a>University of Sydney</a>.
At that time the thesis programmes were innovative, in the sense that each course embodied a specified and substantial period of practical training in the relevant industry.
It was also unprecedented for tertiary institutions at that time to include compulsory instruction in <a>humanities</a>.
</p>
<p>Initially the University operated from the inner Sydney city campus at <a>Ultimo</a> (the current site of the <a>University of Technology, Sydney</a>).
However, in 1951, the <a>Parliament of New South Wales</a> passed the <em>New South Wales University of Technology (Construction) Act</em> 1951 (NSW) to provide funding and allow buildings to be erected at the <a>Kensington</a> site where the university is now located.</p>
<p>In 1958 the University name was changed to the 'University of New South Wales' to reflect its intention to transform itself from a technology-based university to an all-rounded generalist university.
In 1960 it broadened its curriculum and student base with the establishment of Faculties of <a>Arts</a> and <a>Medicine</a>, followed by the <a>Faculty of Law</a> in 1971.</p>
<p>The university's first director was <a>Arthur Denning</a> (1949&#x2013;1952), who made important contributions to the foundations of the university.
In 1953 he was replaced by Professor <a>Philip Baxter</a>, who continued on as vice-chancellor when this position's title was changed in 1955.
Baxter's dynamic authoritarian management was central to the University's first twenty years.
His visionary - but at times controversial - energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968 [<a>http://unsw.edu.au/about/pad/history.html</a>].
He also pioneered new scientific and technological disciplines against an external background of traditionalist criticism.
Growing staff levels, recruited both locally and overseas, conducted research which soon established a wide international reputation.
By the time of Sir <a>Philip Baxter</a>'s retirement in 1969 the University had made a unique and enterprising mark on Australia.
The new Vice-Chancellor, Professor <a>Rupert Myers</a> (1969&#x2013;1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in University style, and challenges of student unrest.</p>
<p>The stabilising techniques of the 1980s managed by Vice-Chancellor Professor <a>Michael Birt</a> (1981&#x2013;1992) provided a firm base for the energetic corporatism and campus enhancements pursued by the subsequent Vice-Chancellor, Professor <a>John Niland</a> (1992&#x2013;2002).
The 1990s saw the addition of a Fine Arts dimension to the University and further development of the public and community outreach which has characterised the University from its beginnings.
At present, private sources contribute 45% of its annual funding [<a>http://unsw.edu.au/about/pad/history.html</a>].</p>
<p>The University established Colleges in <a>Newcastle</a> (1951) and <a>Wollongong</a> (1961), which eventually became two independent universities in 1965 and 1975 respectively, namely the <a>University of Newcastle</a> and the <a>University of Wollongong</a>.</p>
<p>The University is home to the <a>Lowy Cancer Research Centre</a>, one of Australia's largest cancer research facilities.
The centre, costing $127 million, is Australia's first facility to bring together researchers in childhood and adult cancer.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>The University is governed by Council of 22 members including parliamentary and ex-officio members, members elected by staff, students and graduates of the University, and members appointed by the <a>Minister for Education</a> or by Council itself.
It is responsible for acting on the University&#x2019;s behalf to promote its objectives and interests.
The governance of universities has come under increasing scrutiny nationally in recent years, and UNSW and its Council are committed to meeting this scrutiny by demonstrating the highest standards.</p>
<p>The principal academic body is the Academic Board which receives advice on academic matters from the Faculties, College (<a>Australian Defence Force Academy</a>), and the Boards of Studies.
It is responsible for academic policy setting, academic strategy via its eight standing committees, approval and delivery of programs, and academic standards.
The Board comprises 56 members, including the Vice-Chancellor, members of the Executive Team, Deans and Faculty Presiding Members, 24 members elected from the academic staff and four from the student body.
Membership also includes &#x2018;such other persons&#x2019; approved by Council.
The Academic Board advises the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> and Council on matters relating to <a>teaching</a>, <a>scholarship</a> and <a>research</a> and takes decisions on delegation from Council.
Its purpose is to make academic policy; approve courses and programs; further and co-ordinate the work of the Faculties and other academic units; and support teaching, scholarship and research.</p>
<p>The <a>chief executive officer</a> of the University is the Vice-Chancellor and President.
The Deputy Vice-Chancellors and Pro-Vice-Chancellors are responsible for academic operations, research policy, research management, quality assurance and external relations including sponsorship.
The Chancellor is usually an eminent member of society.
(See <a>UNSW Chancellors</a> and <a>UNSW Vice-Chancellors</a>).</p>
<p>The Faculties and boards are responsible for the teaching and examining of subjects within their scope and the Academic Board co-ordinates and furthers their work.</p>
