<h2>History of UFMG</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|400px|Campus Pampulha - UFMG <em>Foto: Eber Faioli</em></a> In 1898, the <a>Ouro Preto</a> Faculty of Law was transferred to Belo Horizonte, which at the time was set to be the new state capital.</p>
<p>A few new unconnected faculties would be founded later: in 1907, the Free School of <a>Dentistry</a>; in 1911, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Engineering, and a course in <a>pharmacy</a> attached to the Free School of Dentistry.</p>
<p>In 1927, these four schools merged to found UMG, University of Minas Gerais, a private institution subsidized by the state government.</p>
<p>The UMG remained funded by Minas Gerais government until 1949, when funding had been delegated to Brazilian Government.
Even though, the name UFMG was not adopted until 1965.</p>
<p>At the time of federalization, the schools of <a>architecture</a>, <a>philosophy</a> and <a>economics</a> were already integrated in the university.
As its expansion carried on, the School of <a>Nursing</a>  (1950), <a>Veterinary Science</a> (1961), <a>Information Science</a> (1962), <a>Music</a> (1962) and <a>Physical Education</a>  (1969) were founded.</p>
<p>In 1968, a university reform altered profoundly the structure of UFMG.
The College of Philosophy spawned multiple institutions: the College of Philosophy and Human Sciences, the Institute of Biological Sciences, the Institute of Exact Sciences, the Institute of Geosciences and the Colleges of <a>Literature</a> and <a>Education</a>.</p>
<p>Five additional courses have been established recently: <a>agronomy</a>, <a>theater</a>, <a>control and automation engineering</a>, <a>computational mathematics</a>, and <a>speech therapy</a>/<a>audiology</a>.</p>
