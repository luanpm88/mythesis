<strong>Link&#x00f6;ping University</strong> (in <a>Swedish</a>: Link&#x00f6;pings universitet, abbreviated LiU) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Link&#x00f6;ping</a>, <a>Sweden</a>.
It started in 1965 as an autonomous faculty within <a>Stockholm University</a> and became a standalone university college (<a>Link&#x00f6;ping Institute of Technology</a>)in 1969.
In 1975 it was granted full university status by the Swedish government.
Thus it became Sweden's sixth university.
It has four faculties and 14 large cross-disciplinary departments.
There are also a number of research and knowledge centers associated with the university.
In 1996 the university opened a second campus in the neighboring city <a>Norrk&#x00f6;ping</a>.
Approximately 26,500 students were enrolled in 2009.</p>

It is known for its <a>interdisciplinary</a> approach.
For example, the university was the first university in Sweden to offer majors (programs), such as <a>Industrial Engineering</a> and <a>Management</a>, International <a>Business Administration</a> (including language studies), <a>Applied Physics</a> and <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, <a>Cognitive Science</a> and Information Technology and Engineering.
In 1980 the Tema Institute was initiated, pioneering interdisciplinary research and gradudate schools in Sweden.
Today research across all the faculties spans over several different areas, for example Organic <a>Bioelectronics</a>, <a>Nanotechnology</a> &amp; <a>Functional Materials</a>, and <a>Medical Visualization</a> &amp; <a>Simulation</a>.
Another specialty is <a>problem-based learning</a> which is adopted in several of the majors (programs) offered.</p>

The university has a reputation for its quality of education, particularly in <a>Medicine</a>, <a>Engineering</a> and <a>Computer Science</a>.
The medical program (leading to the <a>medical doctor</a> profession) and the engineering education areas (leading to degrees in <a>Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a>Applied Physics</a> and <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, among others) are ranked number one in the nation by both the government official <a>Swedish National Agency for Higher Education</a> and by the Association of Swedish Engineering Industries (collecting over 3400 technology companies in Sweden).
The university has one of the oldest and largest computer science departments in northern Europe and was the first university in Sweden to offer <a>Computer Science</a> as a major (program).
The <a>Swedish National Agency for Higher Education</a> ranks the university's computer science department's graduate research education (leading to a <a>Ph.D.</a> in <a>Computer Science</a>) as among the very best in Sweden (together with <a>Royal Institute of Technology</a> and <a>Uppsala University</a>).</p>
<h2>Faculties</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty of Arts and Sciences (<em>Filosofiska fakulteten</em>)</li>
  <li>Faculty of Health Sciences (<em>H&#x00e4;lsouniversitetet</em>) and <a>Link&#x00f6;ping University Hospital</a></li>
  <li><a>Link&#x00f6;ping Institute of Technology</a> (<em>Link&#x00f6;pings tekniska h&#x00f6;gskola</em>)</li>

</ul>
<h2>University Campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The entrance to Campus Norrk&#x00f6;ping.</a><a>left|thumb|Campus
Valla.</a>The
main campus, <em>Campus Valla</em>, is located about three kilometers west of the Link&#x00f6;ping city center, and three of the four faculties have the majority of their operations here.
Many students live in the adjacent residential area <a>Ryd</a>.
Many students, as well as university employees, rely on their own bicycles for transport, often cycling through <a>Valla Wood</a>, which lies between the main campus and the city centre.</p>
<p>The faculty of health sciences is located south of the city center.
The health sciences campus (<em>Campus US</em>) is located in connection with <a>Link&#x00f6;ping University Hospital</a> (US stands here for <strong>U</strong>niversitets<strong>s</strong>jukhuset).
This where medical education is carried out and it is also home to some large cross-faculty departments, such as the department of biomedical engineering.</p>
<p><em>Campus Norrk&#x00f6;ping</em> is situated right in the city center of <a>Norrk&#x00f6;ping</a>, a city 28 miles to the northeast of Link&#x00f6;ping.
It is home to several large cross-disciplinary departments, such as the department of science and technology.
It is also the base for the Link&#x00f6;ping University visualization center.
The Link&#x00f6;ping and Norrk&#x00f6;ping campuses are connected by the 'Campus Bus', which is free-of-charge for students and staff.</p>
<p>The university also has a furniture studies school (<em>Carl Malmsten - Furniture Studies</em>), which since 2009 is located in <a>Liding&#x00f6;</a>.</p>
<h2>Other Organizations within the University</h2>

In 2007, by government initiative, the <a>Swedish National Agency for Higher Education</a> employed an international expert committee to find and award the top five highest quality education areas among <a>all universities and colleges in Sweden</a>.
Link&#x00f6;ping University had two education areas that were awarded: <a>Medicine</a> and <a>Control Theory</a>/<a>Vehicle Engineering</a>.
Link&#x00f6;ping University was the only higher education institute to receive more than one award.
The other awarded institutes were <a>Royal Institute of Technology</a> (one award, <a>Vehicle Engineering</a>), <a>Ume&#x00e5; University</a> (one award, <a>History</a>) and <a>Malm&#x00f6; University</a> (one award, <a>Dentistry</a>).</p>
