<p>The <strong>University of North Carolina at Pembroke</strong> (also known as <strong>UNC Pembroke</strong> or <strong>UNCP</strong>) is a public, co-educational, historically <a>American Indian</a> liberal arts <a>university</a> in the town of <a>Pembroke</a> in <a>Robeson County, North Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>UNC Pembroke is a master's level degree-granting university and one of 17 schools that comprise the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|The Old Main is one of the original, and most recognizable, buildings on campus.</a></p>
<p>Croatan Normal School was created by the General Assembly on March 7, 1887 in response to a local petition, sponsored by <a>NC Representative</a> Hamilton McMillian of Robeson County.
Fifteen students and one teacher composed the initial complement.
With the goal of educating Native American teachers, enrollment was limited to the Native American Indians of <a>Robeson County</a>.</p>
<p>In 1909, the school moved to its present location, about a mile east of the original site.
The name was changed in 1911 to the Indian Normal School of Robeson County, and again in 1913 to the Cherokee Indian Normal School of Robeson County.
In <a>1926</a> the school became a two-year post-secondary <a>normal school</a>; until then it had provided only primary and secondary instruction.</p>
<p>In 1939 it became a four-year institution, a change followed in 1941 by a new name: Pembroke State College for Indians.
The next year, the school began to offer bachelor's degrees in disciplines other than teaching.
In 1945 the college was opened to members of all federally recognized tribes.
A change of name to Pembroke State College in 1949 presaged the admission of white students, which was approved in 1953 up to forty percent of total enrollment; the <a>Brown v. Board of Education</a> decision of the following year eliminated all race restrictions.</p>
<p>In 1969 the college became Pembroke State University, a regional university that was incorporated into the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system in 1972.
The first master's degree program was implemented in 1978.
On July 1, 1996, Pembroke State University became the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.</p>
<p>In recent years, the university's profile and attention has increased recently as the result of a statewide advertising campaign, in which <a>billboards</a>, radio, and television advertisements have touted UNCP as a place &quot;where learning gets personal,&quot; due to small class sizes, among other factors.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|The water feature at UNCP.
Belk Hall and North Hall, which are both women's residence halls, are in the background.</a>
The University's campus is situated just north of Pembroke, located directly behind N.C.
Highway 711.
<a>U.S. Highway 74</a> is located just minutes from campus, as is <a>Interstate 95</a>.
The center of campus is considered to be the Chavis University Center (often referred to as the University Center, or the UC).
Students can <a>bowl</a>, play <a>pool</a> and related games, or just hang out in the lounge.
The dining hall, as well as Bert's Cafe, which houses the newly opened Wild Wings cafe and wingery, as well as SubConnection, are located in the UC.</p>
<p>The UC lawn, an open grass area in front of the UC, is where students play amateur sports, read on benches, or use the area for <a>free speech</a>.
Faculty Row, a thoroughfare for university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections.
The eastern side of campus includes the Livermore Library, Oxendine Science Building, Old Main, and Wellons Hall, among other buildings.
The campus on the west side has the Business Administration Building, Education Center, and most of the residence hall communities.
Lumbee Hall, the Dial Humanities building, the Sampson building, Auxiliary building, and the Jones Athletic Center make up most of the north end of campus.</p>
<p>New to campus is Oak Hall, a residence hall, as well as the UC Annex, opened in September 2007.
Many additions and renovations have taken place on campus beginning in 2000, when an education bond was passed.
Construction is set to continue on campus past 2007.</p>
<p>The Givens Performing Arts Center hosts numerous Broadway shows, orchestras, shows geared towards children, and also hosts the &quot;Distinguished Speaker Series,&quot; in cooperation with the Association of Campus Entertainment, which has brought in notable people such as <a>Nancy Grace</a>, <a>Pat Buchanan</a>, <a>Nikki Giovanni</a>, and <a>Mo Rocca</a>, among many others.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
