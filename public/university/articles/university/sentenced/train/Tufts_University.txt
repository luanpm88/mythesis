<strong>Tufts University</strong> is a private research <a>university</a> in <a>Medford</a>/<a>Somerville</a>, near <a>Boston</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>.
It is organized into ten schools, including two undergraduate programs and eight graduate divisions, on four campuses in <a>Massachusetts</a> and on the eastern border of <a>France</a>.
The university emphasizes <a>public service</a> in all of its disciplines and is well-known for <a>internationalism</a> and its <a>study abroad</a> programs.
Among its schools is the United States' oldest <a>graduate school</a> of international relations, <a>The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</a>.</p>
<p>In 1852, Tufts College was founded by <a>Universalist</a>s who had for years worked to open a non-sectarian institution of higher learning.
<a>Charles Tufts</a> donated the land for the campus on <a>Walnut Hill</a>, the highest point in Medford, saying that he wanted to set a &quot;light on the hill.&quot;
The name was changed to Tufts University in 1954, although the corporate name remains &quot;the Trustees of Tufts College.&quot;
After over a century as a small <a>New England</a> <a>liberal arts</a> college, the French-American nutritionist <a>Jean Mayer</a> became president of Tufts in the late 1970s and, through a series of mergers with other institutions and schools, transformed the school into an international research university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>19th century</h3>
<p>In 1852, the <a>Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote &quot;virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended.&quot;
<a>Charles Tufts</a> was the donor of the land the university now occupies on the Medford-Somerville line.
The twenty-acre plot, given to the <a>Universalist church</a> on the condition that it be used for a college, was valued at $20,000 and located on one of the highest hills in the Boston area, <a>Walnut Hill</a>.
Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, <a>Hosea Ballou II</a> became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year.</p>
<p><a>P.
T. Barnum</a> was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of <a>Jumbo</a> the elephant, who would become the university's mascot.
The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted &quot;that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men.&quot;
At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the <a>Ph.D.</a> degree in biology and chemistry.</p>
<h3>20th century</h3>
<p>Tufts expanded in the 1930s with the opening of the <a>Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</a>, the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States and a collaboration with <a>Harvard University</a>.
In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University.</p>
<p>The university experienced tremendous growth during the presidency of <a>Jean Mayer</a> (1976&#x2013;1992).
Mayer was, by all accounts, some combination of &quot;charming, witty, duplicitous, ambitious, brilliant, intellectual, opportunistic, generous, vain, slippery, loyal, possessed of an inner standard of excellence, and charismatic.&quot;
Mayer established Tufts' veterinary, nutrition, and biomedical schools and acquired the Grafton and Talloires campuses, at the same time lifting the university out of its dire financial situation by increasing the size of the endowment by a factor of 15.  the campaign raised $1.14 billion.
Tufts received the largest donations in its history since 2005, including a $136 million bequeathment to its endowment upon the dissolution of a charitable trust set up by 1911 alumnus Frank C. Doble, a $100 million gift from <a>eBay</a> founder <a>Pierre Omidyar</a> to establish the <a>Omidyar-Tufts Microfinance Fund</a>, and a number of $40 million-plus gifts to specific schools.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2010, the university announced that <a>Anthony P. Monaco</a> would become its thirteenth president.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The University has four main campuses&#x2014;three in the Boston area and one in southern France.</p>
<h3>Greater Boston</h3>
<p>Tufts' main campus is located on <a>Walnut Hill</a> in <a>Medford</a>, about  from <a>Boston</a>.
While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms &quot;Uphill&quot; and &quot;Downhill.&quot;
Many points on the hill have noted views of the <a>Boston</a> skyline, particularly the patio on the Tisch Library roof.
The offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans are located in Ballou Hall, and administrative offices occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby <a>Davis Square</a>, where Tufts makes <a>payments in lieu of taxes</a> on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.</p>
<p>The <a>Schools of Medicine</a>, <a>Biomedical Sciences</a>, <a>Dental Medicine</a>, and the <a>Friedman School of Nutrition</a> are located on a campus in the <a>Chinatown neighborhood of Boston</a>, adjacent to <a>Tufts Medical Center</a>, a 451-bed academic medical institution.
All full-time Tufts Medical Center physicians hold clinical faculty appointments at Tufts School of Medicine.</p>
<p>The <a>Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine</a> is located in <a>Grafton, Massachusetts</a>, west of Boston, on a  campus.
The school also maintains the Ambulatory Farm Clinic in <a>Woodstock, Connecticut</a> and the Tufts Laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole on <a>Cape Cod</a>.</p>
<h3>Talloires</h3>
<p>[[Image:TuftsEuropeanCenter.JPG|thumb|300px|The Tufts European Center on the [[Talloires]] campus]] Tufts has a <a>satellite campus</a> in <a>Talloires, France</a> at the Tufts European Center, a former Benedictine <a>priory</a> built in the 11th century.
The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet and his wife Charlotte and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978.
Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs, and enrolled students live with local families.
The site is frequently the host of international conferences and summits.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Tufts University comprises ten schools including: Tisch College does not grant degrees; the college facilitates and supports a wide range of community service, civil engagement programs, research, and teaching initiatives across the university.</p>
<p>Under the purview of the School of Arts and Sciences is the <a>Experimental College</a>, a non-degree-granting entity created in 1964 as a proving ground for innovative, experimental, and <a>interdisciplinary</a> curricula and courses.
By far, the most successful component of the Ex College is <a>EPIIC</a>, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a>Crane Theological School</a> was opened in 1869 and closed in 1968.</p>
