<h2>History</h2>
<p> North Carolina Central University was founded by <a>James E. Shepard</a> as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua.
It was chartered in 1909 as a private institution and opened on July 5, 1910.
Along with other progressives, future U.S. President <a>Woodrow Wilson</a> contributed small private support for the school's founding.
The school was sold and reorganized in 1915, becoming the National Training School, and supported by <a>Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage</a> of New York.
It became a taxpayer-funded institution in 1923, and was renamed Durham State Normal School.
In 1925, it was renamed the North Carolina College for Negroes, the nation's only state-supported liberal arts college for black students.
Shepard lobbied the <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> for support of college; when traveling to lobby the legislature, Shepard traveled by car since the train to Raleigh was divided into segregated sections.</p>
<p>Whiting was succeeded by <a>LeRoy T. Walker</a> as chancellor, followed by <a>Tyronza R. Richmond</a>,  Dr. Donna J. Benson, <a>Julius L. Chambers</a> (who had previously been director-counsel (chief executive) of the <a>NAACP</a> Legal Defense and Education Fund), <a>James H. Ammons</a>, and on August 1, 2007, <a>Charlie Nelms</a>.</p>
<h3>Issues concerning degree accreditation</h3>

The accreditor refused to recognize the degrees awarded to the 25 students who attended the program.</p>
