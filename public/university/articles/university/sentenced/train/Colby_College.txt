<p><strong>Colby College</strong> is an American <a>private</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located on Mayflower Hill in <a>Waterville, Maine</a> founded in 1813.
Colby is the 12th-oldest independent liberal arts college in the United States.
Approximately 1,800 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually; the college offers 52 major fields of study and 32 minors, and emphasizes project-based learning.

More than two thirds of Colby students participate in study-abroad programs.
Together with <a>Bates College</a> and <a>Bowdoin College</a>, Colby is one of three highly selective liberal arts colleges in Maine.
Colby College competes in the <a>NESCAC</a> league and is considered to be among what are known as the &quot;<a>Little Ivies</a>&quot;.
In 2009, Colby was ranked the 9th best liberal arts college by <a>Kiplinger</a>, ahead of Maine rivals Bowdoin and Bates, 31st best college/university by <a>Forbes</a>, also ahead of Maine rivals Bowdoin and Bates, and 23rd best liberal arts college in the <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> rankings.
Colby was named one of the &quot;25 New Elite Ivies&quot; by the Kaplan College Guide.
Colby was also named one of &quot;25 New Ivies&quot; by <a>Newsweek</a>.
Colby was named to have one of the top ten environmental programs by the 2010 <a>Fiske Guide</a>.
Although one of the oldest liberal arts colleges in the nation, Colby recently completed several major building projects, including the Diamond Building, opened in 2007 for social sciences and interdisciplinary studies.
Diamond houses academic departments and the Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original name of the college, as chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1813, was the <strong>Maine Literary and Theological Institution,</strong> a <a>Baptist</a> college.
After Maine separated from Massachusetts, the Maine legislature conferred upon the school the right to grant degrees.
Soon afterwards, in 1821, the college was renamed <strong>Waterville College</strong>.
During the Civil War, the school was on the verge of closing due to many students leaving to fight the war.
Gardner Colby, a Boston merchant, prominent Baptist philanthropist, and Maine native gave a large donation that allowed the college to remain open.
The college was renamed Colby College in gratitude.</p>
<p>In 1871 Colby College was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students.
One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Low, who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875.. Colby has one of most popular study abroad programs, with over two-thirds of students studying abroad at some point.
Colby has its own programs in <a>Salamanaca</a>, Spain, <a>Dijon</a>, France, and <a>St Petersburg</a>, Russia .
Colby also has an exchange program with <a>Pomona</a>.</p>
<p>Major options include: African-American Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Art, Biology, Chemistry, five options in Classics, Computer Science, East Asian Studies, Economics, Economics-Mathematics, English, Environmental Studies (Policy), Environmental Studies (Science), French Studies, Geology, Geoscience, German Studies, Government, History, International Studies, Latin American Studies, Mathematics, Mathematical Sciences, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, Religious Studies, Russian Language and Culture, Science, Technology, and Society, Sociology, Spanish, Theater and Dance, and Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies.</p>
<p>Colby's most popular majors are Government, Economics, and Biology.
Consequently, the three majors are also some of Colby's strongest.
The Economics Department is the 6th most published of any liberal arts school.
The Government Department's faculty are frequently cited in the <a>New York Times</a>, <a>Washington Post</a>, and testify on Capital Hill.
Professor of Campaign Finance Anthony Corrado was cited in over 300 articles in 2008-2009 .
Other prominent faculty in the department include Professor of American Politics, L. Sandy Maisel, and Professor of American Politics, G. Calvin Mackenzie.
</p>
<p>Colby is very successful in its placement of graduate students.
Recent placements include <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Northwestern</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>University of Chicago</a>, <a>Oxford</a>, <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> and <a>Stanford</a>.

<h2>Student life on campus</h2>
<p>In 2003 the college created a Student Programming Board (SPB) to produce social events on campus.
This student-run organization sponsors multiple programs every week ranging from dances to special lectures to bingo nights to large-scale live performances.
In the past, SPB has brought such acts as <a>Jurassic 5</a>, <a>Citizen Cope</a>, <a>Blackalicious</a>, <a>Ben Folds</a>, <a>Ben Kweller</a>, <a>OK Go</a>, <a>Dane Cook</a>, <a>Talib Kweli</a>, <a>Matisyahu</a>, <a>State Radio</a>, <a>Lupe Fiasco</a>, <a>Blue Scholars</a>, <a>Guster</a>, <a>Common</a>, <a>Mates of State</a>, <a>CAKE</a>, <a>Bob Marley (comedian)</a> and <a>Naughty By Nature</a>.
In addition to SPBs programming, clubs on campus often put on all-school events.</p>
<p>In 2004 and 2005 Colby received press for a Student Government program offering beer and wine to of-age students in a dining hall.
For a nominal cost, students were able to consume up to two beverages during their meal on specific Beer and Wine nights held periodically throughout the year.
The program has since been cut.</p>
<p>Colby's student newspaper, The Colby <em>Echo</em>, has been published since 1877.
The paper distributes 1,600 papers weekly in academic buildings, dining halls and throughout Waterville and publishes online at <a>http://www.thecolbyecho.com</a>.
Colby's radio station, <a>WMHB</a> 89.7 FM, has been on air since March 1949.
WMHB broadcasts new and diverse programming to central Maine and around the world.
Colby also has a vibrant a cappella scene.
There are six groups on campus: The Blue Lights (Men), The Colby Eight (Men), The Megalomaniacs (Co-ed), The Sirens (Female), The Colbyettes (Female), and EVE (Female).</p>

<h3>Colby College Museum of Art</h3>
<p>The Colby College Museum of Art <a>Colby museum</a>, one of the largest art museums in Maine, has a number of collections covering a variety of different styles of paintings, sculpture, and other media.
Its collection is particularly strong in American art.
The museum is notable for an entire wing dedicated to works by American painter <a>Alex Katz</a>.
It has major outdoor sculptures by <a>Richard Serra</a> and <a>Sol LeWitt</a>.
The Colby museum plans to open a three-story, glass expansion in 2013 to display works from the $100 million donation by the Mr. and Mrs. Lunder, known as the Lunder Collection, promised to Colby in 2007.
It will be the largest art museum in the state of Maine.
Admission is free.</p>
<h3>Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips (COOT)</h3>
<p>In 1975 Colby instituted its first outdoor orientation trip.
From 15 first-year students, two upperclassmen and a professor on the first trip, the program has grown to include all members of incoming classes participating in a COOT (Colby Outdoor Orientation Trip).
The program, which has been expanded to include on-campus orientation and is called COOT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, now offers 52 trips in the fall semester and an ICED COOT program for those students who spend the first semester of their freshman year abroad.
Destinations for fall trips include hiking trips at <a>Acadia National Park</a>, <a>Mount Katahdin</a>, and other locations around Maine; canoe trips on the <a>Kennebec</a> and Moose Rivers, along with other trips around the state.
The various trips are designed to appeal to incoming students with  a variety of interests and fitness levels.
The primary goals of COOT are to ease new students' transition into college and to introduce them to the Maine's cultural and natural resources.
COOT leaders are chosen from upperclass students and are expected to help the students both during and after the trip with the adjustment to campus life.</p>
<p>In 1984, following an investigation of campus life commissioned by the Board of Trustees, a decision was made to withdraw recognition from Colby&#x2019;s Greek system as it was seen to be &quot;exclusionary by nature&quot;.
The day that fraternity and sorority decision was announced happened to fall on a Sunday and was known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; by many on the campus at the time.. </p>

<h2>Environmental Practices</h2>
<p>In the Fall of 2009, Colby launched <em>Green Colby</em> to highlight Colby's environmental policies (<a>carbon footprint</a>, conservation, student involvement etc.) .
In this vein, the school has signed a number of official agreements to reduce its environmental impact, including the Governor&#x2019;s Carbon Challenge and the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment.
All of the school's electricity comes from renewable sources &#x2014;hydro and biomass&#x2014;with 10 percent of campus electricity provided by an on-campus cogeneration turbine.
Colby also has an ambitious composting program, which processes more than 100 tons of food and yard waste annually.</p>
<p>Colby has an Integrated Pest Management plan to regulate the use of pesticides, but this plan does not include a list of the chemicals used on turf, trees, or buildings.
There is very strong concern, expressed at the student government level, about the college's regular use of pesticides and herbicides to rid the campus of weeds.
Colby's own Environmental Studies Professors argue that these practices are detrimental to the health of people who come into contact with them.
Specifically, these pesticides and herbicides have been shown to damage reproductive systems in both female and male adults.</p>
<h2>Alma mater</h2>
<p>Colby's <a>alma mater</a> is &quot;Hail, Colby, Hail&quot;.
The lyrics to the song were written by Karl R. Kennison from the class of 1906 and it is sung to the tune of &quot;<a>O Canada</a>&quot;.
In 1979, the second line was changed from &quot;thy sons from far and near&quot; to &quot;thy people far and near.&quot;</p>
<p>:Hail, Colby, Hail! :Thy people far and near :Stand at thy call, :Our Alma Mater dear.
:Thy shaded paths recall our steps :To gather at thy shrine.
:Thy memoried halls reclaim our hearts :Till all our thoughts are thine.</p>
<p>:Hail, Colby, Hail! :Hail, Colby, Hail! :To thee we lift our hearts and homage pay; :Our Alma Mater, Hail the Blue and Gray!</p>
