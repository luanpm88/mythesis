<p> The <strong>University of Delaware</strong> (colloquially &quot;<strong>UD</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>UDel</strong>&quot;) is the largest university in <a>Delaware</a>.
The main campus is in <a>Newark</a>, with satellite campuses in <a>Dover</a>, <a>Wilmington</a>, <a>Lewes</a> and <a>Georgetown</a>.
It is medium-sized &#x2013; approximately 16,000 undergraduate and 3,500 <a>graduate student</a>s.
Although UD receives public funding for being a <a>land-grant</a>, <a>sea-grant</a>, <a>space-grant</a> and <a>urban-grant</a> state-supported research institution, it is also privately <a>charter</a>ed.
At present, the school's endowment is valued at about $1.3975 billion US.
The University of Delaware is ranked 68th by <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> in the category of &quot;Best National Universities.&quot;
In 2009, UD ranked No. 22 in the in-state category of <em><a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a></em> magazine's list of the 100 Best Values in Public Colleges, and No. 18 for out-of-state.</p>
<p>The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation.
However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833.
Its original class of ten students included <a>George Read</a>, <a>Thomas McKean</a>, and <a>James Smith</a>, all three of whom would go on to sign the <a>Declaration of Independence</a>.
</p>
<p>The school has renowned engineering, science, business, education, urban affairs and public policy, <a>public administration</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, history, <a>chemical engineering</a>, <a>chemistry</a> and <a>biochemistry</a> programs, among others, drawing from the historically strong presence of the nation's chemical and <a>pharmaceutical</a> industries in the state of Delaware.
In 2006, UD's engineering program was ranked number 10 in the nation by <a>The Princeton Review</a>.
In 2009, <em>US News and World Report</em> ranked the chemical engineering program 10th among undergraduate programs and 9th among graduate programs.
It is one of only four schools in North America with a major in <a>art conservation</a>.
UD was the first American university to begin a study abroad program.</p>
<h2>Organization and student body</h2>
<p><a>right|400px|thumbnail| The south green with Memorial Hall in the background and Magnolia Circle in the foreground.</a>
</p>
<p>The university is organized into 7 colleges: </p>
<ul>
  <li>College of Agriculture and Natural Resources </li>
  <li>College of Arts and Sciences </li>
  <li>Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics </li>
  <li>College of Earth, Ocean and Environment</li>
  <li>College of Education and Human Development</li>
  <li>College of Engineering</li>
  <li>College of Health Sciences </li>
</ul>
<pre> </pre>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the colleges.
Also, on April 3, 2007 the second annual <em><a>BusinessWeek</a></em> review of the &quot;Best Undergraduate B-Schools&quot; ranked UD's Lerner College of Business and Economics 29th among the nation's top 58 public university programs and 61st among the 500 schools earning international accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.</p>
<p>In recent years, the student body has been labeled as one of the most politically apathetic in the nation.
Although there are a number of activist student groups on campus, the University was ranked 4th out of 361 schools in the &quot;Election?
What Election?&quot; category in the Princeton Review's 2007 college ratings.
</p>
<p>This perception is quickly changing however, and such rankings have not gone unnoticed by university officials.
An April 2008 report by the school's Strategic Planning Committee identified student engagement in the &quot;social, cultural, artistic, and scientific challenges of our age&quot; as one of the university's primary long-term goals.
University students have also responded to the charges of student apathy, and the 2007-2008 academic year saw the creation of a number of student organizations aimed at increasing political dialogue amongst undergraduates.
</p>
<p>The 2008 Presidential Election has also brought much attention to the University and has increased student involvement in political activism.
In August 2008, the University was hailed as the &quot;epicenter&quot; of the presidential election by <a>Bloomberg News</a>.
<a>Joe Biden</a> (D), Delaware, who graduated from the University, was elected Vice President of the United States on November 4, 2008 as <a>Barack Obama</a>'s running mate.
In addition, Biden's wife, Jill, as well as <a>David Plouffe</a>, Obama's campaign strategist, and <a>Steve Schmidt</a>, McCain's campaign strategist all graduated from UD.  Senator Biden appeared at the University in a campaign rally on October 31, 2008, just days before the election, in front of an estimated crowd of 7,000.</p>
<h2>Students and Admissions</h2>
<p> The student body at the University of Delaware is largely an undergraduate population.
The University of Delaware offers over 100 undergraduate degrees, and due to the vast number of academic options many students complete dual degrees as well as double majors and minors.
Delaware students have a great deal of access to work and internship opportunities.
An easily accessible online database contains over 1,000 internship opportunities available for all majors.
The Center hosts 15 major career fairs with over 500 employers in attendance and the Campus Interview Program, which brings over 600 employer representatives to campus.
Like other corporate players that call Delaware home, <a>MBNA</a> (now  <a>Bank of America</a>) invests in the UD community through the construction of the new Career Services Center building, the hiring of students, and sponsorship of scholarships.
With Delaware's location in <a>Newark, Delaware</a>, students are able to land jobs and internships in Delaware, as well as in <a>New York</a>, <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Wilmington</a>, <a>Baltimore</a>, and <a>Washington, D.C.</a>.
More than 90% of Delaware graduates who do not go directly to graduate school report finding full-time positions within six months of graduating.</p>
<p>Additionally, &quot;4+1&quot; Accelerated Programs also allow students to pursue both their bachelor's and master's degrees within a five-year period.
Opportunities in the College of Human Services, Education and Public Policy exist to acquire a bachelor's in leadership and a master's in public administration.
Students may also pursue a bachelor's degree in hotel management and a master's in business administration through a &quot;4+1+1&quot; program where students work for one year between the undergraduate and graduate experiences.
Students in the College of Engineering can pursue a bachelor's degree in one of the University's engineering disciplines and a master's in business administration.</p>
<p>The Medical Scholars Program is an opportunity for academically competitive students who wish to pursue careers in the medical profession.
Successful participation in the Medical Scholars Program leads to a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies from the University of Delaware and the M.D. degree from <a>Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The Ronald McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program is an initiative to prepare and empower low-income, first generation college students and underrepresented students (of African American, Latino, and Native American descent) for doctoral study; allowing them to complete a Baccalaureate degree, enroll in graduate school, and ultimately attain a doctoral degree.
Since its inception at Delaware, the program boasts a 100% placement rate of its scholars in graduate programs across the country.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Dean's Scholar Program is designed to serve the needs of a highly selective group of students who are motivated and talented and have a clear view of their long-range educational goals.
Dean's Scholars are granted flexibility in college requirements so that they can build their entire program with faculty advisers and create original programs of study, including off-campus experiences and independent research.
This opportunity is available to outstanding sophomores in the Colleges of Arts and Science, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Health and Nursing Sciences, and Education and Public Policy.</p>

</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|350px|thumbnail|The University of Delaware Green</a> The University of Delaware traces its founding to 1743, when Presbyterian minister <a>Francis Alison</a> opened up his &quot;Free School&quot; in his home in <a>New London, Pennsylvania</a>.
The school changed its name and location several times, ending up as the Academy of Newark in 1769 (chartered by the colonial government).
Since Delaware was part of the Pennsylvania colony until 1776, the academy was denied charter as a college in order to prevent its competing with the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> (then known as the <strong>College of Philadelphia</strong>).
In 1833, the General assembly for the State of Delaware passed the &quot;An Act to Establish a College at Newark&quot;, and the next year, Newark College opened.
It changed its name in 1843 to Delaware College and it merged with the Academy of Newark.
The school closed from 1859 until 1870 (Newark Academy separated from the college in 1869).
On March 28, 1921, by another act of state assembly, it merged with the nearby Delaware Women's college (founded in 1913) to form the University.</p>
<p>On October 23, 2009 the University of Delaware signed an agreement with <a>Chrysler</a> to purchase a  closed vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the University for expansion for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring plan.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The University recently implemented a system named UD Alert, to alert students and faculty of emergencies on campus by sending text, voice, and e-mail messages to the individuals.
The University was also one of the original campuses in the country to implement the &quot;blue light&quot; emergency phone system in the late 1980s.</p>
<h4>Residence Life controversy</h4>
<p>In October 2007, the Office of Residence Life's diversity program was criticized by several students, and faculty as well as the <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE) for infringing on students rights.
FIRE argued that residence hall programs, one on ones and floor meetings administered through <a>resident assistant</a>s forced students into accepting &quot;university-approved ideologies.&quot;
FIRE specifically criticized programs dealing with issues of <a>sexual identity</a>, <a>race</a>, and <a>sustainability</a>.
The controversy originated from training programs given to resident assistants that suggested all white people were inherently <a>racist</a>, and because minorities were not in the majority, they could not be racist.
The program was suspended on November 1, 2007, with university president Patrick T. Harker quoted as saying, &quot;There are questions about its practices that must be addressed and there are reasons for concern that the actual purpose is not being fulfilled.&quot;
In May 2008, against some student protest, the University reinstated an amended version of the previous program.
The <a>National Association of Scholars</a> (NAS), an <a>education reform</a> group, and an early critic of the Residence Life program, called the amended version a repackaging of the original program.
Said the NAS: &quot;The submission is essentially a repeat of its predecessor program.
Some of the text has been re-worded but its meaning remains unchanged.&quot;
The program was also criticized by <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> commentator Naomi Schaeffer Riley.
Riley, among other things, criticized loose definitions of environmental sustainability that include &quot;Fair Trade&quot;, &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;, &quot;Multicultural Competence&quot; and &quot;Domestic Partnerships&quot;.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p><a>right|thumbnail|350px|South Green at the University of Delaware</a> In 1891, prominent Philadelphia architect <a>Frank Furness</a> designed Recitation Hall.</p>
<p>The recent history of the university has been marked by massive construction projects.
North or Laird Campus, formerly home to the Pencader Complex, has been entirely redesigned and renamed Independence Complex.
This began with the construction of a Marriott Courtyard run by the HRIM (Hotel Restaurant and Institutional Management) department.
Three new residence hall buildings have also been built and named after the three University Alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence, <a>George Read</a>, <a>Thomas McKean</a> and <a>James Smith</a> (who signed for Pennsylvania).
The third Delaware signer, <a>Caesar Rodney</a>, already had a dorm complex named after him on West Campus.
A fourth residence hall opened for the Fall of 2008, named Independence Hall; the building is split into East and West wings.</p>
<p>New academic buildings have also been constructed recently.
In 2006, the Center For The Arts had its grand opening, with new facilities for the school's music and theater programs.
Also in 2006, Jastak-Burgess Hall opened, now home to the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature.
In 1998, Gore Hall opened on the Green and connects to Smith Hall via an overpass on South College Avenue.
Other recent construction projects include Alfred Lerner Hall (for business) and massive renovations to DuPont Hall, Wolf Hall, and Memorial Hall.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>The University is currently headed by its 26th President <a>Patrick T. Harker</a>, who was formerly dean of the <a>Wharton School</a> of the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.
Previous President <a>David P. Roselle</a> retired at the end of the 2006&#x2013;2007 academic year.
President Roselle had held that post for sixteen years.
Prior to Roselle, the President was <a>E.A. Trabant</a>.</p>
<p>Roselle's 2006 salary of $979,571 was the highest of any public university president in the United States (Purdue University President Martin C. Jischke's 2006 salary was second, at $880,950).</p>
<h2>Study abroad</h2>
<p>The University of Delaware was the first <a>American</a> university to begin a <a>study abroad</a> program, which was later adopted by many other institutions.
The program began when Professor <a>Raymond Watson Kirkbride</a> took a group of 9 students to <a>Paris, France</a> during the fall semester of 1923.
Since this initial trip, the University of Delaware has expanded its study abroad program, which now encompasses over 80 different programs in more than 40 subjects to over 45 countries on all seven <a>continents</a> making it one of the largest programs in the country.
As of 2006-2007, approximately 45% of all Delaware undergraduate students take advantage of study abroad experiences prior to completing their baccalaureate degrees.</p>
<p>Delaware's study abroad program offers many options for students.
Undergraduates have the option of studying abroad for a five-week winter or summer session, or an entire semester.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right|300px|thumbnail|Dupont Hall on the Central Green, College of Engineering</a> The athletic teams at Delaware are known as the Fightin' Blue Hens with a mascot named <a>YoUDee</a>.
YoUDee is a <a>Blue Hen Chicken</a>, after the team names and the state bird of <a>Delaware</a>.
YoUDee was the 2002 UCA National Mascot Champion, was elected into the mascot hall of fame in 2006, and was the 2009 UCA Open Division Mascot National Champion.</p>
<p>UD offers 23 varsity sports, which compete in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division-I</a> (<a>FCS</a> for football).
Delaware is a member of the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a> (CAA) in all sports.
Delaware was a member of the <a>Atlantic 10 Conference</a> in football until the 2006 season.
Football is the most popular and most successful sport at Delaware.
The Fighting Blue Hens football teams have won six national titles, including the 2003 NCAA I-AA Championship.
In <a>2007</a>, the Delaware Blue Hens were the runners up in the NCAA I-AA National Championship game, but were defeated by (defending champions) Appalachian State.</p>
<p>Former head football coaches <a>Bill Murray</a>, <a>Dave Nelson</a> and <a>Harold &quot;Tubby&quot; Raymond</a> are College Football Hall of Fame inductees.
Delaware is one of only two schools to have three straight head coaches inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame (<a>Georgia Tech</a> is the other).
Delaware's only other NCAA National Championship came in 1983 for Women's Division I Lacrosse.</p>
<p>The Blue Hens have won four CAA Championships since joining in 2001: one each for the women's 2004 field hockey team, the 2007 men's lacrosse team, the 2007 women's volleyball team, and the <a>2010 football team</a> (shared with <a>William &amp; Mary</a>).
(Unofficially, the women's rowing team has won the CAA title four times since 2001, placing second the other two times.)
The 2007 men's lacrosse program reached the final four of the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> for the first time in its history.</p>
<h3>Intrastate competition</h3>
<p>In November 2007, it was announced that the University of Delaware and <a>Delaware State University</a> would have their first game against each other, the game being in the first round of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.
The game was played on November 23, with University of Delaware winning 44-7.
Delaware was the victor in the teams' first regular season match-up in September 2009.
Future contests are scheduled for 2012-2014.</pre>

<p>In addition, the University of Delaware is known for having one of the best <a>marching bands</a> on the east coast, the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hen Marching Band.
The band ranges from 300 to 350 members every year and can be seen performing at every home football game as well as at various festivals and competitions, including the <a>Collegiate Marching Band Festival</a> in Allentown, PA.
Additionally, the marching band was selected to perform in the <a>56th Presidential Inaugural Parade in 2009</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, the new Center for the Arts building opened.
This building has a number of recital halls and a large number of practice rooms, most with upright pianos.
The practice rooms are locked and cannot be used by students who are not music majors or in an official UD ensemble.
The university employs a tiered access system, with larger rooms and rooms with grand pianos being reserved for certain groups of students.
In addition the music department also uses their old building, with offices, classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls.
This building has public-access practice rooms with pianos.</p>
<p>In 2004, the University of Delaware Chorale, under the direction of Dr. Paul D. Head and accompanied by Betsy Kent, were invited to perform at the <a>American Choral Directors Association</a>'s International Convention in <a>Los Angeles</a>.
In April 2007, the Chorale won the Grand Prix at the Tallinn International Choral Festival, having scored higher than 40 other choirs from around the world.
In 2000, the music department purchased an 18th century Ceruti violin for professor and <a>virtuoso</a> violinist <a>Xiang Gao</a>.

<h2>Student media</h2>
<p><a>right|thumbnail|300px|Trabant University Center</a> There are currently four student publications at Delaware: <em>The Review</em>, <em>DEconstruction Magazine</em>, <em>UDress</em>, and the <em>Mainstreet Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Review</em> is a weekly publication, released in print and online on Tuesdays.
It is an independent publication and receives no financial support from the university.
It is distributed at several locations across campus, including Morris Library, the Perkins Student Center and the Trabant University Center, as well as various academic buildings and the dining halls.
<em>The Review<strong>s office is located at 250 Perkins Student Center, facing Academy Street, and is above the offices of <a>WVUD</a>.
In 2004, it was a <a>National Newspaper Pacemaker Award</a> Finalist, and was also named one of the ten best non-daily college newspapers by the <a>Associated Collegiate Press</a>.
They currently have a print circulation of 10,000.</strong></em></p>
<p>In 2002, <em>DEconstruction Magazine</em> was formed &quot;to create a forum for student writing that fell outside of journalism or creative writing.
Traditionally, DEconstruction focused on an editorial style of writing to discuss everything from politics to pop culture.&quot;</p>
<p><em>UDress</em> magazine is the on-campus fashion magazine which publishes one issue per semester, in conjuncture with fashion events.</p>
<p><em>The Mainstreet Journal</em> focuses on creative writing.
</p>
<p>The student-run, non-commercial, educational <a>radio station</a> at Delaware <a>broadcasts</a> on 91.3 and uses the <a>call letters</a> <a>WVUD</a>, which the University purchased from the University of Dayton in the 1980s.
Although not its intended call letter pronunciation, 'VUD has taken on the slogan &quot;the Voice of the University of Delaware.&quot;
They are licensed by the city of <a>Newark, Delaware</a> and broadcasts with a power of 1,000 <a>watt</a>s 24 hours a day with its offices and studios located in the Perkins Student Center.</p>
<p>The transmitting facilities are located atop the Christiana East Tower <a>residence hall</a>.
WVUD is operated by University of Delaware students, a University staff of two, and community members.
No prior radio experience is necessary, nor is there a need to enroll in any certain major to become a part of WVUD.
The radio station has a variety of programming, featuring both music and talk formats.</p>
<p>Another student magazine, <em>aUDio</em>, was announced in Fall 2007.
They aim to be &quot;the University of Delaware's first online music magazine.&quot;
To celebrate their launch, there was a concert on November 29, 2007, in the Trabant University Center.</p>
<p>STN is the student-run, non-commercial, educational <a>television station</a> at the University of Delaware.
The station broadcasts second-run movies, original student produced content as well as live sports coverage.
The initials, STN, originally stood for Shane Thomas Network, later changed to Student Television Network.</p>
<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of Delaware's undergraduate population is affiliated with a <a>fraternity or sorority</a>.
There are over 19 fraternities and 15 sororities (chapters &amp; colonies) in the <a>Interfraternity Council</a> (IFC), <a>National Panhellenic Conference</a> (NPC), and <a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a> (NPHC).
They all coordinate via the Greek Council.
All Greek organizations participate in an accreditation process called the <a>Chapter Assessment Program (CAP)</a>.
CAP ratings award chapters with either a Gold, Silver, Bronze, Satisfactory or Needs Improvement designation.

<h2>Alcohol abuse</h2>
<p>A campus website claims that a 1993 study by the <a>Harvard School of Public Health</a> found that high-risk drinking at UD exceeded the national norm.
On this survey, a majority of students reported binge drinking more than once in a two-week interval.
The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month.
Ironically, UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average.</p>
<p>In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations.
Of these, 120 led to arrests.
These figures are up from previous years, 1062 in 2004 and 1026 in 2003.
This represents approximately 6% of the student population.
Caution must be used in interpreting these figures; a higher number of reported violations may represent more enforcement, not necessarily more actual violations.
</p>
<p>UD has expended considerable effort and financial resources to reduce the drinking problem on campus; in 1991 UD founded the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies.
One of the center's major initiatives is a collaborative plan to reduce irresponsible drinking at UD, called &quot;A Matter of Degree&quot;</p>
<p>Beginning in the fall of 2006, incoming freshman had to complete an online course, AlcoholEdu.</p>
<p>At least one student organization has undertaken the goal of &quot;providing fun activities for those who chose not to drink&quot; and to &quot;promote the idea that one doesn't need alcohol to have a good time.&quot;</p>
