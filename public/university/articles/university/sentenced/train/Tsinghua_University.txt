The school is one of the nine universities of the <a>C9 League</a>.
It was established in 1911, originally under the name &quot;Tsinghua Xuetang&quot;.
The school was renamed the &quot;Tsinghua School&quot; in 1912.
The university section was founded in 1925 and the name &quot;National Tsinghua University&quot; adopted in 1928.
With a motto of <em>Self-Discipline and Social Commitment</em>, Tsinghua University describes itself as being dedicated to academic excellence, the well-being of Chinese society and to global development.
Tsinghua is often ranked as the first or second best university in <a>mainland China</a> in many national and international rankings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tsinghua College (&#x6e05;&#x83ef;&#x5b78;&#x5802; <em>Q&#x012b;nghu&#x00e1; Xu&#x00e9;t&#x00e1;ng</em>) was established in <a>Beijing</a>, <a>China</a> in 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince.
It was funded by the <a>Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program</a>, which consisted of unexpected surplus money from <a>indemnities</a> China had paid the United States following the <a>Boxer Rebellion</a>.
It was first a preparatory school for students later sent by the government to study in the <a>United States</a>.
The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the <a>YMCA</a> from the <a>United States</a> and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.
In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study.</p>
<p>In 1928, the authority officially changed its name to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).
During the <a>Second World War</a> in 1937, Tsinghua University along with <a>Peking University</a> and <a>Nankai University</a>, merged to form Changsha Temporary University in <a>Changsha</a>, and later <a>National Southwestern Associated University</a> in <a>Kunming</a> of Yunnan province.
After the war, Tsinghua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation.</p>
<p>After the communist takeover at the end of the <a>Chinese Civil War</a> in 1949, which led to the creation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Tsinghua University's then President Mei Yi-Qi, followed by many professors, fled to <a>Taiwan</a> where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became <a>National Tsing Hua University</a> of Taiwan.</p>
<p>In 1952, China government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a <a>Soviet</a> style system, with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study.
Tsinghua University was disassembled, losing its law school, school of agriculture, school of sciences and humanities, and became a polytechnic engineering university.
Even so, Tsinghua University remained in the top tier schools in China.
In many years following this regroup, the school was commonly referred to as the &quot;<a>MIT</a> of China.&quot;
But since the 1980s, the university began to incorporate a <a>multidisciplinary</a> system.
As a result, several schools were re-incorporated.
These included the School of Sciences, School of Business and Management, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, <a>Tsinghua Law School</a>, School of Public Policy and Management, and the Academy of Arts and Design.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Most national and international university rankings place Tsinghua amongst the best universities in <a>mainland China</a>.
A majority of selected students are among the brightest high school graduates in the country.
Admissions to its graduate schools are also daunting by any measure.
For instance, only 16% of MBA applicants are admitted, making it as competitive as the renowned Wharton School MBA program at the University of Pennsylvania.
The current Chinese president, <a>Hu Jintao</a>, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964.
The current Chinese vice president, <a>Xi Jinping</a>, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1979.
The University's <a>Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology</a> is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing.</p>
<p>Tsinghua has a reputation for hosting some of the most distinguished guest speakers of any university in the world, with international leaders such as <a>Bill Clinton</a>, <a>Tony Blair</a>, <a>Henry Kissinger</a>, <a>Carlos Ghosn</a>, and <a>Henry Paulson</a>, all recently giving lectures to the university community.</p>
<p>As of 2003, Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories.
In September 2006, <a>Peking Union Medical College</a> was renamed to Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, although the Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University and Tsinghua University remain two separate institutions.
The university offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs and 107 Ph.D. programs.
Recently, Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a <a>Master of Laws</a> program in <a>American</a> <a>law</a>, through a cooperative venture with the <a>Temple University Beasley School of Law</a>.
The university is a member of LAOTSE, an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia.
Each year, the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with <a>Franklin Pierce Law Center</a> of <a>Concord</a>, <a>New Hampshire</a>.
It has its own editorial, Tsinghua University Press.</p>
