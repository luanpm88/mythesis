<p></p>
<p><strong>Reed College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>independent</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in southeast <a>Portland, Oregon</a>.
Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus located in Portland's <a>Eastmoreland</a> neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the <a>Tudor</a>-<a>Gothic</a> style, and a forested canyon wilderness preserve at its center.
Reed is known for its mandatory freshman <a>humanities</a> program, for its required senior-year thesis, as the only private undergraduate college with a primarily student-run <a>nuclear reactor</a> supporting its science programs, and for the unusually high percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs and other postgraduate degrees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Reed College's Eliot Hall on a rare snowy day.</a>
The <strong>Reed Institute</strong> (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908, and Reed College held its first classes in 1911.
Reed is named for Oregon pioneers <a>Simeon Gannett Reed</a> and Amanda Reed.
Simeon was an entrepreneur in trade on the <a>Columbia River</a>; in his will he suggested that his wife could &quot;devote some portion of my estate to benevolent objects, or to the cultivation, illustration, or development of the fine arts in the city of Portland, or to some other suitable purpose, which shall be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city and to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants&quot;.
The first president of Reed (1910&ndash;1919) was <a>William Trufant Foster</a>, a former professor at <a>Bates College</a> and <a>Bowdoin College</a> in <a>Maine</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the college did not grow out of student revolts and experimentation, but out of a desire to provide a &quot;more flexible, individualized approach to a rigorous liberal arts education&quot;.
Founded explicitly in reaction to the &quot;prevailing model of East Coast, <a>Ivy League</a> education,&quot; the college's lack of <a>varsity athletics</a>, <a>fraternities</a>, and exclusive social clubs &mdash; as well as its <a>coeducational</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, and <a>egalitarian</a> status &mdash; gave way to an intensely academic and intellectual college whose purpose was to devote itself to &quot;the life of the mind&quot;.</p>
<p>The college holds a reputation for the <a>progressive</a> and anti-authoritarian leanings of its community.</p>
<h2>Distinguishing features</h2>
<p>According to <a>sociologist</a> Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the <a>United States</a>, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum.
It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110 &mdash; an intensive introduction to the <a>Classics</a>, covering ancient <a>Greece</a> and <a>Rome</a> as well as the <a>Bible</a> and <a>ancient Jewish history</a>.
Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual &mdash; Reed's <a>TRIGA research reactor</a> makes it the only school in the United States to have a <a>nuclear reactor</a> operated entirely by undergraduates.
and its small classes emphasize a &quot;conference&quot; style, in which the teacher often acts as a mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer.
While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.</p>
<p>Although letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed.
According to the school, &quot;[s]tudents are encouraged to focus on learning, not on grades.
Students are evaluated rigorously, and semester grades are filed with the registrar, but by tradition, students do not receive standard grade reports.
Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed.
There is no <a>dean&#x2019;s list</a> or honor roll per se, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an entire academic year receive academic commendations, which are noted on their transcripts, at the end of the spring semester.
Many Reedies graduate without knowing either their cumulative <a>GPA</a> or their grades in individual classes.
Reed also claims to have experienced very little grade inflation over the years, noting, for example,  that only seven students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2007&quot;.
(Transcripts are accompanied by a card explaining Reed's relatively tough grading system, so as to not penalize students applying to graduate schools.)
And though Reed does not award <a>Latin honors</a> to graduates, Reed does confer several awards for academic achievement at the time of commencement, including naming students to <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>.</p>
<p>Reed has no fraternities or <a>sororities</a>, and few <a>NCAA</a> sports teams, although physical education classes (which range from <a>kayaking</a> to <a>juggling</a>) are required for graduation.
Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic teams, most notably the Rugby, Fencing, and Ultimate Frisbee teams.
Reed's ethical code is known as &quot;The Honor Principle&quot;.
First introduced as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior, with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of the burden of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life.
While inspired by traditional <a>honor system</a>s, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves, not just their enforcement.
Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior.
Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>Discrete cases of grievance, known as &quot;Honor Cases&quot;, are adjudicated by a Judicial Board, which consists of nine full-time students.
There is also an &quot;Honor Council,&quot; which consists of students, faculty, and staff, designed to educate the community regarding the Honor Principle and mediate conflict between individuals.</p>
<h2>Academic program</h2>
<p>Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program.
Overall, Reed offers five <a>Humanities</a> courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students.</p>
<h3>Divisions</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Reed College campus</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Division of Arts: includes the Art (Art History and Studio Art), Dance, Music, and Theatre Departments;</li>
  <li>Division of History and Social Sciences: includes the History, Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, and Sociology Departments, as well as the International and Comparative Policy Studies Program;</li>
  <li>Division of Literature and Languages: includes the Classics, Chinese, English, French, German, Russian, and Spanish Departments, as well as the Creative Writing and General Literature Programs;</li>
  <li>Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences: includes the Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Departments, and</li>
  <li>Division of Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics: includes the Psychology, Philosophy, Religion, and Linguistics Departments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Humanities program</h3>
<p>Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole &quot;an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and, ... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind&quot;.
The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in &quot;world&quot; literature, the other in &quot;world&quot; history) is one manifestation of this effort.
One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995.
The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus.
These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.</p>
<p>Reed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course <em>Introduction to Western Humanities</em> covering ancient <a>Greek</a> and <a>Roman</a> literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy.
Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take <em>Early Modern Europe</em> covering <a>Renaissance</a> thought and literature; <em>Modern Humanities</em> covering the <a>Enlightenment</a>, the <a>French Revolution</a>, the <a>Industrial Revolution</a>, and <a>Modernism</a>, and/or <em>Foundations of Chinese Civilization</em>.
There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.</p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary and dual-degree programs</h3>
<p>Reed also offers interdisciplinary programs in American studies, Environmental Studies, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry-Physics, Classics-Religion, Dance/Theatre, History-Literature, International and Comparative Policy Studies (ICPS), Literature-Theatre, Mathematics-Economics, and Mathematics-Physics.</p>
<p>Reed offers <a>dual-degree programs</a> in Applied Physics (with <a>OHSU</a>/<a>OGI</a>), Computer Science (with <a>University of Washington</a>), Engineering (with <a>Caltech</a> and others), Environmental Science (with <a>Duke University</a>), and Fine Art (with the <a>Pacific Northwest College of Art</a>).</p>
<h2>Admissions and student demographics</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Eliot Hall</a> Until the late 1990s, Reed accepted a larger percentage of total applicants than peer institutions &#x2014; 76% in 1996.
This led to high levels of attrition (drop-outs) during that period.
Since then, the number of applicants for freshman admission has increased sharply.
Since 2002, Reed's attrition rate has moved toward that of peer institutions, and the five-year graduation rate (76% for the 2003/2004 entering class) now exceeds the national average.
</p>
<p>In 2009, the applicant pool for the class of 2013 was the third largest in Reed's history: 3,159 students applied and 1,225 were admitted, for an admission rate of 38.8%.
The admitted class of 2013's average combined Math and Verbal <a>SAT</a> scores were 1407; the mean composite ACT score was 31; and the mean high school <a>GPA</a> was 4.034.</p>
<p>Reed's student body is 45% male and 55% female, and includes 22% minority students: 3% self-report as Black (including African-American, African, and Afro-Caribbean); 6% as Hispanic; 9% as Asian, 2% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other.
Minority numbers include some of the 7% international citizens (13% of freshmen did not self-report their ethnicity).
In the class of 2010, 38% of students are from the United States's West Coast (<a>California</a>, Oregon, <a>Washington</a>), with the most coming from California.</p>
<h3>Tuition and finances</h3>
<p>The total base cost for the 2010-11 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, is $51,850.
In 2009-10 about half of students received financial aid from the college.
In 2004 (the most recent data available), 1.4% of Reed graduates defaulted on their student loans --  below the national <a>Cohort Default Rate</a> average of 5.1%.</p>
<p>Reed's endowment as of June 30, 2008 was $427.3 million, below the median of about $500m for comparable schools, and well below Amherst and Swarthmore's approximately one billion dollar endowments.
During the 2009 fiscal year, the endowment is expected to contribute about $19 million toward the college's operating expenses, an increase of about $3 million from two years ago.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> In 1995 Reed College refused to participate in the <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> &quot;best colleges&quot; rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings.
According to Reed's Office of Admissions:  </p>
<p><em><a>Rolling Stone</a></em>, in its 16 October 1997 issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by <em>U.S. News</em> after they stopped sending data to <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a>.</em>
Nicholas Thompson reiterated this judgment in an article in <em>The Washington Monthly</em> in 2000.
Reed has also made the same claim.</p>
<p>However, in 2005 Reed did submit statistics to the <a>Princeton Review</a>, and received first in Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience.
In 2009, The <a>Princeton Review</a> ranked Reed number two in &quot;Best Classroom Experience,&quot; number three in &quot;Students Study the Most,&quot; and number five in &quot;Birkenstock-Wearing, Tree-Hugging, Clove-Smoking Vegetarians&quot;.
In 2006, <a>Newsweek</a> magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies,&quot; listing it among &quot;the nation's elite colleges&quot;.
The guide to college admissions for <a>About.com</a>,
moreover, places Reed as one of the top ten liberal arts colleges in the country.</p>
<h3>Academic honors</h3>
<p>Reed has produced the second-highest number of <a>Rhodes scholars</a> for any liberal arts college&mdash;31&mdash;as well as over fifty <a>Fulbright Scholars</a>, over sixty <a>Watson Fellow</a>s, and two <a>MacArthur (&quot;Genius&quot;) Award</a> winners.
A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn <a>Ph.D.</a>s, particularly in the <a>science</a>s, <a>history</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>philosophy</a>.
Reed is third in percentage of its graduates who go on to earn Ph.D.s in all disciplines, after only <a>Caltech</a> and <a>Harvey Mudd</a>.
Reed is first in this percentage in <a>biology</a>, second in <a>chemistry</a> and <a>humanities</a>, third in <a>history</a>, <a>foreign language</a>s, and <a>political science</a>, fourth in the <a>physical sciences</a>, <a>math</a> and <a>computer science</a>, and <a>science</a> and <a>engineering</a>, fifth in <a>physics</a> and <a>social sciences</a>, sixth in <a>anthropology</a>, seventh in <a>area and ethnic studies</a> and <a>linguistics</a>, and eighth in <a>English literature</a> and the <a>medical sciences</a>.
</p>
<h3>Political</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Dorm Block</a>&#x0009;  Reed has a reputation for being politically left-wing.
According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, &quot;because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities.
Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and untenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest.
At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure&quot;.
A statement of &quot;regret&quot; by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees.
In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the College, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.</p>
<h3>Drug use</h3>
<p>Since the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students.
<em><a>The Insider's Guide to the Colleges</a></em>, written by the staff of <em><a>Yale Daily News</a></em>, notes an impression among students of institutional permissiveness: &quot;according to students, the school does not bust students for drug or alcohol use unless they cause harm or embarrassment to another student&quot;.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|A.
E. Doyle's 1920 Master Plan</a> The Reed College campus was established on a southeast <a>Portland</a> tract of land known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims.
The college's grounds include 116 contiguous acres, including a wooded wetland known as Reed canyon (see below).</p>
<p>Portland architect <a>A.
E. Doyle</a> developed a plan modeled on <a>Oxford University</a>'s St. John's College that was never implemented in full.
The original campus buildings (including the Library, the Old Dorm Block, and what is now the primary administration building, Eliot Hall) are brick <a>Tudor Gothic</a> buildings in a style similar to <a>Ivy League</a> campuses.
In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the <a>Modernist</a> style.
The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by famed Modernist architect <a>Pietro Belluschi</a> at the same time as his celebrated <a>Equitable Building</a> in downtown Portland.</p>
<p>The campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth, and there are now twenty-one academic and administrative buildings and eighteen residence halls.
Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy.
At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use.
Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a  tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive.
Reed&#x2019;s &quot;immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007&#x2013;08 academic year.
Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing&quot;.</p>
<p>Reed also owns more than a dozen homes adjacent to the campus that are used to house new and visiting faculty.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Old Dorm Block</a> Reed houses about 1,000 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus.)
language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), &quot;temporary&quot; housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon - Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan).
There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to a cat residence hall.
The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the College's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as &quot;Asylum Block&quot; because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an <a>insane asylum</a>.
Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect <a>Pietro Belluschi</a>.
</p>
<p>Under the 10-year Campus Master Plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced, and MacNaughton to be remodeled.
According to the master plan, &quot;The College's goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the [full-time] student population.
At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students&quot;.</p>
<p>Canyon Day, a tradition spanning more than ninety years, is held twice a year.
On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.</p>
<p>A landmark of the campus, the <a>Blue Bridge</a>, spans the canyon.
It appears on almost every viewbook that the college circulates.
This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which &quot;featured stressed plywood girders &mdash; the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge  long and  high.
It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime&quot;.
The Blue Bridge was originally  known as the &quot;Cross Canyon Bridge&quot; until student Rain Lynham bought and installed black lights in 1998 as decoration for Renn Fayre, the traditional end of year, campus-wide party, of which she was the organizer that year.
The new look proved so popular with students and faculty alike that the original white bulbs were never replaced.</p>
<p>A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008.
This bridge, dubbed the &quot;Bouncy Bridge&quot; by students, is  long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and &quot;connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus&quot;.
The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as <a>Mona Hatoum</a>, <a>Al Held</a>, <a>Marko Lulic</a> and <a>Gregory Crewdson</a> as well as the contemporary art collection of <a>Michael Ovitz</a>.
In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits.
The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder, who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.</p>
<h3>Food services</h3>
<p>The cafeteria, known simply as &quot;Commons&quot;, has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services.
The commons dining hall is operated by <a>Bon App&#x00e9;tit</a>, and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis.
Suiting the student body, <a>vegan</a> and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu.
It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception Caffe Paradiso, a small cafe on the other side of campus which also accepts board points.</p>
<p>The Reed College Co-op is a theme residence located in Garden House, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall.
It is the only campus dorm that is independent of the school's board plan.
This residence houses ten students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings.
It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants.
</p>
<p>The Paradox (&quot;Est. in the 80s&quot;) is a student-run cafe located on campus.
In 2003 the Paradox opened a second cafe, dubbing it the &quot;Paradox Lost&quot; (an allusion to <a>John Milton</a>'s <em><a>Paradise Lost</a></em>), at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the &quot;Bio Fishbowl&quot;.
The new north-campus dorms, which opened in Fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, dubbed &quot;Cafe Paradiso&quot;, thereby providing three coffee shops within a  campus.
This third shop is not student-run, but is handled instead by an outside catering service.</p>
<h3>Off-campus housing</h3>
<p>Reed also has off-campus housing.
Many houses in the <a>Woodstock</a> and <a>Eastmoreland</a> Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.
Many students traditionally give their houses creative nicknames as well, which can last through multiple cycles of rentership.
&lt;!-- Please see note on talk page about house names --&gt;</p>
<h2>Icons and student life</h2>
<h3>Griffin</h3>
<p>The official mascot of Reed is the <a>griffin</a>.
In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of <a>Dante</a>'s <em><a>Commedia</a></em> the <a>gryphon</a> is associated with the <a>Tree of Knowledge</a>.
The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon.
The most common examples of &quot;Richmond Rose&quot; are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.</p>
<h3>School song</h3>
<p>The school song, &quot;Fair Reed,&quot; is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song &quot;Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;.
It was composed by former president <a>William Trufant Foster</a> shortly after Reed's founding, and is rarely heard today.</p>
<h3>Student nickname</h3>
<p>Reed students and alumni referred to themselves as &quot;Reedites&quot; in the early years of the college.
This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous &quot;Reedie&quot; after <a>World War II</a>.
Around campus, prospective students are called &quot;prospies&quot;.</p>
<h3>Unofficial mottos and folklore</h3>
<p>An unofficial <a>motto</a> of Reed is &quot;Communism, Atheism, Free Love&quot;, and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, t-shirts, etc.
It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek slogan&quot; in reference to Reed's <a>nonconformism</a>. Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into <a>World War I</a>, as well as the college's support for <a>feminism</a>, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the <a>Socialist Party of America</a> to speak on campus about the <a>Russian Revolution</a>&#x2019;s potential impact on <a>militarism</a>, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its <a>nonsectarian</a> status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.</p>
<p>An alternative motto first appeared on shirts in 1976 as &quot;Capitalism, Avarice, Free Beer&quot;, but never overtook the original in popularity.
A small group of students has recently been petitioning the bookstore to update the shirts' text to read, &quot;Socialism, Agnosticism, Safe Sex&quot;, a comment on the increasingly moderate (though still quite radical) predominating values of the student body.
Additionally, the punning &quot;Reed: You Might Learn Something&quot; was a popular slogan in the mid-1980s.&lt;br
/&gt; <a>150px|thumb|left|Faux Reed Seal</a> Another popular characterization was from a letter to the local newspaper, in which Reed students were said to resemble &quot;unmade beds&quot; which provided a subject for creating special Reed occasion costumes.
</p>
<p>Every year's <em>Reed College Student Handbook</em> (a manual on student life written by students, not to be confused with the <em>College Handbook</em>, which is written by college officials) contains a test called the &quot;Reed College Immorality Quotient&quot; that tests an individual's <a>immorality</a> on topics such as <a>sex</a>, <a>theft</a>, and <a>drug use</a>.</p>
<p>One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly  concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since 1913.
The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl's <a>oral history</a>.
The original Doyle Owl was almost certainly destroyed many years ago, but a number of replicas (of varying degrees of quality) remain in circulation, contributing to the frequency of its appearance.
</p>
<p>Well-known on-campus myths claim there is an intact <a>MG</a> under the concrete foundation of the college library, an underground primate lab working exclusively with <a>snow monkey</a>s under the Psychology building (the legend states that the presence of this lab was discovered when a snow monkey escaped into the Canyon and necessitated the closing of the facility), and a four-story lab/habitation <a>arcology</a> under the Physics building.
There are many other such stories, often referred to as &quot;Reed legends&quot;.</p>
<h3>Paideia</h3>
<p>During the week before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds <a>Paideia</a> (roughly drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education').
This festival of learning takes the form of ten days (although originally a whole month) of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community.
The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed.
While the full calligraphy course is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject.</p>
<h3>Renn Fayre</h3>
<p>[[Image:Olde-Reede-RennFayre06.JPG|thumb|right|A student-made [[Katamari Damacy|katamari]] at the 2006 Renn Fayre]] Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration at Reed with a different theme each year.
Born in the 1960s as an actual <a>renaissance fair</a>, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the <a>Renaissance</a>, although its name has persisted.</p>
<p>Renn Fayre commences with the Thesis Parade, where graduating seniors make a symbolic march to deliver their theses to the registrar and a fiery pit to burn the year's notes.
Students, faculty, and staff gather at the entrance to the library where chaos and champagne get the party started.
The parade commences when the senior class moves through the library and out through what was the library's original front entrance (now an emergency exit).</p>
<p>The Fayre runs from Friday to Sunday, beginning on the last day of classes for the spring semester.
The week after Renn Fayre is Reading Week, in which no classes are held; final examinations are held in the following week.</p>
<p>Renn Fayre is often called the metaphorical explosion of the student body after a year of intense pressure.
Traditions and events include bizarre art installations, bug-eating contests, the alumni Meat Smoke, a naked <a>Slip 'n Slide</a>, occasional motorized couches, fireworks, naked people painting themselves blue (a tribute to the ancient <a>Picts</a>), a <a>beer garden</a>, the Glo Opera (performed at night by actors covered in EL wire and glowsticks), lube wrestling, full-contact human chess, parachuters, castle-storming and bike-jousting by members of <a>C.H.V.N.K. 666</a>, a fire-dancing performance by the Weapons of Mass Distraction (the college's own Fire Troupe), a softball tournament of academic department teams, a feast contributed to by student-donated leftover board points, a cooking contest, and a general sense of mayhem.
Serious injuries are rare, thanks in part to the non-profit White Bird Clinic, and the presence of vigilant student volunteers (the &quot;Karma Patrol&quot;) who stay sober, distribute bagels and water, and ensure the wellness of Renn Fayre participants, while the &quot;Border Patrol&quot; sees to the exclusion of unauthorized visitors.</p>
<p>Student participation is almost unanimous; faculty and staff also attend some of the festivities.
Alumni and authorized guests may also participate.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>According to Reed's website, each semester, a $130 student body fee &quot;is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate.
The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin&quot;.
Student body funds (totalling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester's funding poll.
The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either 'top six', 'approve', 'no opinion', 'disapprove' or 'deep six.'
These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters.
Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus.
The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.

<p>The school's student-run newspaper, the <em>Quest</em>, has been published since 1913, and its radio station, <a>KRRC</a>, has been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, since 1955.</p>
<p>Most organizations are highly informal, although some that partner with outside groups such as <a>Oxfam</a> or <a>Planned Parenthood</a> are more structured.
The Reed archive of <a>comic book</a>s and <a>graphic novel</a>s, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various <a>beer garden</a>s throughout the year and during <a>Renn Fayre</a>, has existed for many years.
Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective &ndash; dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture &#x2013; have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.</p>
<p>Reed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on Mount Hood, recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.</p>
