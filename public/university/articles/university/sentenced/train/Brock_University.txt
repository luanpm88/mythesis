Isaac Brock]]]]Brock University was established by <a>the Brock University Act</a> in 1964.
When the University first opened in September 1964, classes were held at the St. Paul Street United Church in downtown <a>St.

His last words are said to have been <em>Surgite!</em>
(Latin for &quot;push on&quot;) &#x2014; now used as the University's motto.
