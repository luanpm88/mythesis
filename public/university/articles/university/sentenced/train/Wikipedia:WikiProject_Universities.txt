<p>:<em>This page is about improving Wikipedia articles about universities.
For information about using Wikipedia in education see <a>Wikipedia:School and university projects</a>.</em>
<strong><a>WikiProject</a> <a>Universities</a></strong> aims to improve the coverage of <a>universities</a> and <a>college</a>s on <a>Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Our goals include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Standardize the structure and content of all college and university articles</li>
  <li>Represent the interests of colleges and universities and ensure their articles' compliance with Wikipedia's <a>five pillars</a></li>
  <li>Improve the coverage of university articles, propelling them to <a>featured article status</a></li>
  <li>Serve as the central resource for all discussions and information related to colleges and universities</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>Task forces</h3>
<p>Task forces are meant to provide centralized information and a discussion area for topics that have a sufficiently large scope, but that would not benefit from having a separate WikiProject with all of the additional work that would involve.
The currently organized task forces are:</p>
<p></p>
<h3>National differences</h3>
<p>University and college systems vary to a great degree between different countries.
Here are some good practice-adaptations of WikiProject Universities for different countries:</p>

  <li><a>University of Wollongong</a>: Has had considerable changes since last reviewed in mid-2007.
I was wondering what improvement would be required to reassess it as C-class or even B-class.

  <li><a>Wheeling Jesuit University</a> has received considerable changes since its stub rating in '07.

Please &amp; Thank You! <a>tallguy0187</a>(<a>talk</a>) 16:06, 09 February 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li>The <a>University of Texas at Dallas</a>, has made many strides recently in terms of professionalism.
We are uncertain the direction the page should take, and any comments from experienced editors would be appreciated.
<a>Wikipedia:Peer review/University of Texas at Dallas/archive1</a>  Thanks.
<a>Oldag07</a> (<a>talk</a>) 05:46, 3 May 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>Jordan University of Science and Technology</a>: An outside opinion on this article, a reassessment of it's status, and suggestions for improvement would be very much appreciated.
Thank you.
<a>Ymousa</a> (<a>talk</a>) 12:30, 4 June 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>University of Texas at Dallas</a> I have done some editing on the <a>University of Texas at Dallas</a> article and I notice it is rated Start-Class, WikiProject Universities.
It still lacks some pictures due to construction but I was hoping it might now move up a bit from the &quot;Start-Class&quot; on the rating.
Thanks, <a>Stan9999</a> (<a>talk</a>) 17:29, 8 June 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>Butler University</a>:  There has been considerable work done to this article and it is still rated &quot;Start-Class.&quot;
I'm hoping to get it reviewed to get more guidance.
I don't think it's been reviewed in nearly two years.
Thanks!
<a>City boy77</a> (<a>talk</a>) 02:03, 14 June 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>University of New South Wales</a> has not been reviewed for three years.
Could we have it reviewed so that I know where to start improving it?
<a>Tim Bennett</a> (<a>talk</a>) 06:07, 30 August 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>Griffith University</a>: Would like some assistance in improving this page and its content.
Could we review it and help me improve it?
<a>Jonathan</a><a>Mecha3</a> (<a>talk</a>) 01:51, 10 December 2010 (UTC)</li>
  <li><a>Maharishi University of Management</a>.
I wonder if we could have an outside neutral eye look at this article.
Weight seems to be more towards the  pejorative than in other articles on university articles I've looked at.
For example, the section on the research and NIH grants is far smaller than the section on negative responses to the research and university.
As the article expands an outside eye may help determine what kind of content and how much should be added.
Thanks very much for the look.(<a>olive</a>
