Originally located in Trenton proper, the college was moved to its present location in adjacent Ewing Township during the early to mid-1930s.
Since its inception, TCNJ has undergone several name changes, the most recent being the  1996 change to its current name, from <em>Trenton State College</em>.</p>
<p>In recent years, TCNJ has earned national recognition as a leading academic institution.

TCNJ has also earned recognition by The Princeton Review for having a world-class library and a happy student body.
The college is particularly well-known for its prestigious business school and highly selective medical program..</p>
<p>TCNJ is organized into seven schools, all of which offer four-year <a>bachelor's degree</a> programs, and several of which offer <a>master's degree</a> programs.
A great deal of emphasis is placed on <a>liberal arts</a> education via the college's general education requirements.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Green Hall</a></p>
<p>The College of New Jersey was established on February 9, 1855 by an act of the <a>New Jersey Legislature</a> mandating the creation of a state normal school, making the New Jersey State Normal School the first teacher training institution in New Jersey and the ninth in the United States.
Prior to this, then-<a>Governor</a> <a>Rodman McCamley Price</a> had actively promoted the notion of founding a training institute for New Jersey's teachers, and helped to mobilize support among influential state leaders:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Paul Loser Hall</a> For the first 73 years, the school was located in <a>Trenton</a> on Clinton Avenue.
Beginning in 1925, the institution offered its first four-year baccalaureate degrees, and engaged on a transitional program of expansion.
In 1928, a suburban tract of 210 acres (0.8&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) was purchased in <a>Ewing Township, New Jersey</a> and preparations were underway to relocate the College.
The first building erected on the new campus was Green Hall, built in traditional Georgian colonial style.
The majority of buildings now on campus reflect Green Hall's architecture.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Kendall Hall</a> Programs in graduate study were instituted in 1947, followed by accreditation from various national associations in the 1950s.
The enactment of the <em>Higher Education Act of 1966</em> paved the way for TCNJ to become a comprehensive institution by expanding its degree programs into a variety of fields aside from the education of teachers.
By 1972, 70 percent of entering students were selecting non-education majors.
At this time, the college was known as Trenton State College.</p>
<p>In 1996, in a move spearheaded by <a>Harold Eickhoff</a>, The College of New Jersey adopted its current name in order to become more academically competitive on a national level.
Some alumni were unhappy with the change as they were proud being graduates of Trenton State College.
This name change raised a heated debate with <a>Princeton University</a> which was known as the <em>College of New Jersey</em> from its founding in 1746 until 1896.
In response, the administration at Princeton University sought legal action to protect its claim on the name, but the action was subsequently dismissed.</p>

<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Library</a> Most first-year students live in the Travers/Wolfe towers.
Honors first-year students live in Cromwell Hall.
Second-year students live in New Residence, Allen Hall, Brewster Hall, Ely Hall, Norsworthy Hall, Centennial Hall, Eickhoff Hall and Decker Hall.
There are currently plans to construct another building specifically for second-year housing.
Upperclassmen typically live in Townhouses South, East or West, or in one of the two newly constructed apartment complexes; Phelps Hall and Hausdoerffer Hall.
Upperclassmen may also live in one of the various College Houses that surrounds the campus.
While first-year and second-year students are guaranteed on-campus housing; a lottery system provides housing to juniors and seniors.
As a result, the percentage of resident students dwindles from 95 percent of first-year students to 50 percent of upperclassmen living on campus.
However in Spring 2010, it was announced that everyone who had applied for housing for 2010-2011 school year managed to receive it.</p>
<h3>Dining</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Eickhoff Hall</a> There are currently seven dining facilities on the TCNJ campus as well as a convenience store and bookstore (where convenience store-like food and beverages are sold).
Eickhoff hall houses the convenience store and the main dining hall, where students pay a door price and have access to buffet style food.
There are several different sections within this dining hall, providing students with a variety of food and beverage choices.
The late night dining hall is located between the Travers and Wolfe towers (freshman housing) and looks rather like a large diner.
Flatscreen TVs are mounted among the couches and tables to provide entertainment while students eat.
A cafe serving Starbucks coffee is located on the main level of the TCNJ library.
Sandwiches, bagels, and other items are served in addition to beverages.
Many students choose the cafe as a late-night study area.
A similar cafe, known as the &quot;Kineticart&quot; is located in Armstrong Hall, the main engineering building.
Breakfast foods and some lunch items are served here.
It is located in the center of Armstrong Hall, and among the tables and chairs various engineering and science exhibits can be viewed.
The Brower Student Center is home to three different dining facilities.
The &quot;Fairgrounds&quot; is located near one of the main entrances and is the smallest of the three.
Because there are various couches and benches of the students center surrounding it, it does not have seating of its own.
The Rathskellar or &quot;Rat&quot; is a restaurant and bar, where students can sit down to order meals from servers, including the famous &quot;Kesselburger&quot; (chili-cheese burger).
Alcoholic beverages are served, and IDs are always checked.
Also within the &quot;Rat&quot; is a stage where bands perform on various nights.
Often there are special shows on the weekends, featuring different acts.
On weekends there is also karaoke.
The last dining facility is the student center food court and is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Stud&quot;.
Students can get food and other items at various stations, which they then bring to one of the registers to purchase.
&quot;The Stud&quot; has the second largest quantity of seating out of the dining facilities (the first being Eickhoff) but during lunch it can get very full.
Movies are also screened here on certain nights.</p>

The College Union Board (CUB) sponsors visits by celebrities as well as movie showings, all of which are funded by the Student Finance Board.
To help kick off each new fall semester, &quot;LollaNoBooza&quot; is held.
This is a large carnival-like affair meant to be an alternative to a night of partying.</p>
<p>Greek life has a foot-hold at TCNJ, with roughly 13% of the student population belonging to a fraternity or sorority.
The Greek organizations are governed by the Inter-Greek Council, whose purpose is to unite the members of the Greek community in spirit of mutual interest.
It organizes and governs activities, highlights goals and opens lines of communication between the members of the organizations and the rest of the campus community.
The Inter-Greek Council recognizes 27 organizations; 15 sororities, 12 fraternities, and 1 coed organization.

<h3>Brower Student Center</h3>
<p>The Brower Student Center (BSC) is the student center on the campus.
The BSC was originally built in 1976 and has continued to serve the students through the present day.
The Brower Student Center seeks to provide on-campus activities for all the students of TCNJ as well as maintain partnerships within the community that accentuate the student and community experience.</p>
<p>A game room is also located in the student center, complete with multiple pool tables, TVs with wiis connected, ping pong and other games.</p>
<p>The building is home to all of the student organizations on campus, as well as the dining facilities that are run by Sodexo Incorporated and a campus bookstore.
All recognized student organizations have an office or cubicle, or at least a meeting area.
Most of these are located on the second level, but there are a handful located elsewhere.
The student-run newspaper, for example, has both its business office and production room in the basement.</p>
<p>The building was named after former president Clayton R. Brower, who served as president during the time that TCNJ was referred to as Trenton State College.
His wife, Hulianne Jerron Brower, was an active volunteer in the surrounding community.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The TCNJ Lions logo</a> The College of New Jersey is affiliated with the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> and participates in athletics events as a <a>Division III</a> school.
It is a member of the <a>New Jersey Athletic Conference</a> and the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a> (ECAC).
The <a>mascot</a> is <em>Roscoe</em> the <a>Lion</a>.</p>
<p>TCNJ's varsity teams are the top combined first- and second-place finishers of all 424 Division-III schools in the nation over more than 25 years.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|TCNJ Lions</a> The main athletic facility, Lions Stadium, holds 6,000 spectators and is <a>home</a> to the <a>football</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, and <a>intramural</a> teams.
The stadium opened in the fall of 1984 and featured the first North American installation of <a>AstroTurf</a>'s vertical-drainage system.
This system prevents the &quot;duck-pond effect&quot; commonly seen with other artificial surfaces.
In 2008, reports indicated that the turf contained higher-than-acceptable levels of lead and was subsequently removed.
Now, the stadium is furnished with <a>Tiger Turf</a>, which is the first installation of the <a>Trophy Turf</a> in the United States.
The stadium has hosted multiple NCAA tournaments and championship games, as well as the annual <a>Special Olympics New Jersey</a> and the annual USSBA Central Jersey Regional <a>marching band</a> competition.</p>
<p>The women's lacrosse team has played in the championship game 16 out of 20 possible times, winning 11 (though the 1992 title was later vacated) and qualifying for the NCAA tournament 21 consecutive times through 2005, highlighted by a 93-1 record from 1991 to 1996.
The women's field hockey team has won 9 Division III crowns.</p>
<p>The TCNJ <a>wrestling</a> team hosts the NCAA championships regularly and has placed in the top 20 nationally for 30 consecutive years, including 5 <a>national championships</a> (1979, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987), 5 runner-up finishes, and numerous finishes in the top 5.</p>
<p>The TCNJ <a>track and field</a> teams have also dominated the New Jersey Athletic Conference.
Since the NJAC title was first contested in 1997, TCNJ has won the title &#x2014; both indoor and outdoor &#x2014; each year.</p>
<h2>Museums and exhibits</h2>
<p>The College of New Jersey is home to the KidsBridge Museum of Tolerance, located in Forcina Hall.
This interactive museum teaches children to appreciate and tolerate racial and ethnical differences.
While the museum does have employees of its own, many TCNJ students volunteer there.
The <a>David Sarnoff</a> museum, formerly located at Princeton Junction, is a new arrival to TCNJ.
The collection detailing the life of NBC founder <a>David Sarnoff</a> is now located in Roscoe L. West Hall.
