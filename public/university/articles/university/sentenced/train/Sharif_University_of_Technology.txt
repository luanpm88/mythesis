<p>  <strong>Sharif University of Technology</strong> () is a university of higher education in <a>technology</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>physical sciences</a> in <a>Iran</a>.
Sharif University of Technology is one of the most prestigious Iranian universities, and is considered Iran's <a>MIT</a> .
The university is located in the <a>Tarasht</a> neighborhood of <a>Tehran</a> within walking distance of <a>Azadi Square</a>, and has an <a>international campus</a> in <a>Kish</a>, a resort island in the Persian Gulf.
The university is named after <a>Majid Sharif Vaghefi</a>, a former student who was killed in 1975.
It was formerly named the <strong>Aryamehr University of Technology</strong> () and for a short period after the 1979 revolution, the university was called <strong>Tehran University of Technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Sharif University of Technology (SUT) provides both undergraduate and graduate programs in 14 main departments.
The student body consists of about 6000 undergraduate students and 3700.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was first founded in 1965 with the name <em>Aryamehr Technical University</em> by Dr. <a>Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi</a> (&#x0645;&#x062d;&#x0645;&#x062f; &#x0639;&#x0644;&#x064a; &#x0645;&#x062c;&#x062a;&#x0647;&#x062f;&#x06cc;).
At that time, there were 540000 lty members and a total of -12 students who were selected by national examination.
Also only four departments were established:  tallurgical, Mechanical, and Chemical Engineering.</pre>
<p>In 1972, <a>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a> appointed <a>Sayyed Hosein Nasr</a> as president of the university with the goal of modeling the school based on the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, but with roots in Iranian culture.. In 1974 a new campus of the university was established in [[Isfahan]].
But later that campus became an independent university, named [[Isfahan University of Technology]] (IUT).
The emblem of IUT still closely resembles SUT's emblem .</pre>
<p>Currently the university has grown to an elite school with over 9000 students, 700 of whom are studying for a <a>doctorate</a>, and over 500 faculty members in 15 main departments .</p>

<h2>Academic profile</h2>
<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>Sharif University was established in 1966 as an &quot;Engineering&quot; university.
The first departments of the university were Electrical, Metallurgical, Mechanical, and Chemical Engineering Professor <a>Burton Richter</a>'s opinion about Sharif's students during his speech in Sharif university was: &quot;<em>The students here are very impressive, I expect to hear a lot more from you all in the future</em>.&quot;
However, Sharif university school of engineering is not formally ranked or acknowledged as one of world best schools of  engineering.
In 2008 in response to an invitation from the president of Sharif University of Technology, presidents of six U.S. research universities visited Iran.
The group includes <a>Jared Cohon</a> of <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, <a>J.
Bernard Machen</a> of the <a>University of Florida</a>; <a>C.
Daniel Mote, Jr.</a> of the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a>; <a>David Skorton</a> of <a>Cornell University</a>; <a>Larry Vanderhoef</a> of the <a>University of California, Davis</a> and <a>David Leebron</a> from <a>Rice University</a>.
This recognition is highly valuable, as there is no political connection between Iran and United States.</p>
<h3>Affiliated research centers</h3>
<p>In order to be able to expand its relations with the industry, Sharif University has supported establishment of Research Centers.
These are usually started with a spin off funding provided by or through university, but will start to accept research and development projects from industry in their first months of establishment.
Most of the employees of these centers are Sharif University students, while in some cases recent alumni or students of other universities have been recruited as well.</p>

<h2>Research and endowment</h2>
<p>Sharif University is a public university and its funding is provided by the government of Iran.
For the top ranks of the national university entrance exam, education is free in all public universities.
The people with ranks below the normal capacity of the universities will be required to pay part or all of the tuition.</p>
<p>Industrial companies have supported Sharif University, and provided research funding for the desired programs and projects.
For instance, the Petroleum Engineering department was supported by Iran Oil industries .</p>
<p>Sharif University was appointed as a Center of Excellence (<a>:fa:&#x0642;&#x0637;&#x0628; &#x0639;&#x0644;&#x0645;&#x06cc;</a>) by Iran's Ministry of Science and Technology in the fields of &quot;automation and robotics&quot;, &quot;energy conversion&quot;, &quot;earthquake engineering&quot;, &quot;mathematics&quot;,&quot;telecommunication systems&quot; and &quot;physics&quot;.
This appointment is based on national standing based on research achievements and invested funding in the mentioned topics.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Political activities</h3>
<p>Prior to the Islamic Revolution many political organizations including but not limited to <a>Fadaian Khalg</a> and <a>People's Mujahedin of Iran</a> active members and supporters were among students of the Sharif University.
In the 14 years since its inception many active members and supporters were arrested and killed by <a>SAVAK</a> among those <a>Abdolmajid Pirzadeh Jahromi</a>, Majid Ahmadzadeh (Fedaian Khlaq) can be named.</p>
<p>Through the student political movement after the <a>2nd of Khordad Movement</a>, Sharif students were also actively involved.
The major groups with political intentions at Sharif, during 1997-2003, were student <a>Basij</a> and the Association of Muslim students, briefly called Anjoman (Association).
Most other smaller groups were allies of either or Basij or Anjoman.
Basij was a serious opposer  of  <a>Mohammad Khatami</a>, the president of the time.
Whereas, Anjoman was a loyal follower.
There has been several clashes between member students of the two groups.
Free speech tribunes, occasionally end in harsh quarrel-like debates.
Anjoman's free thoughts wallpaper, Ayeneh Sharif, was constantly attacked  by Basij students.
However, the major clash between Anjoman and Basij occurred while the student movement was in silence in most other universities.
In 2006, a serious controversy resulting in physical tensions, occurred after Basij attempted to bury bodies of unknown <a>Martyr</a>s of the <a>Iran&#x2013;Iraq War</a> at the universities' Mosque court.</p>
<h3>Alumni association (SUTA)</h3>
<p> Many of Sharif alumni are spread all around the world since lots of them continue their graduate studies in Europe or North America and also some of them immigrated to these countries, therefore it is not easy to establish local organization to be contacted by the alumni.
<a>Sharif University of Technology Association</a> (SUTA) is a global organization that was formed in 2000 to facilitate communication and collaboration among the graduates, faculty and staff of the Sharif University.</p>
<p>This non-profit organization is registered in the state of California, USA and has many chapters and affiliates around the world.
Its mission is to enhance professional, academic, and social contacts among its membership, and to strengthen the ties between the association members living outside of Iran and the University.</p>
