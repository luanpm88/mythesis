<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Otago</strong> () in <a>Dunedin</a> is <a>New Zealand's</a> <a>oldest university</a> with over 20,000 students enrolled during 2006.</p>
<p>The university has New Zealand's highest average research quality and in New Zealand is second only to the University of Auckland in the number of A rated academic researchers it employs.
It topped the New Zealand <a>Performance Based Research Fund</a> evaluation in 2006.</pre>
<p>Founded in 1869 by a committee including <a>Thomas Burns</a>, the university opened in July 1871.
Its motto is &quot;<a>Sapere aude</a>&quot; (&quot;Dare to be wise&quot;).
(The <a>University of New Zealand</a> subsequently adopted the same motto.)
The <a>Otago University Students' Association</a> answers this with its own motto, &quot;Audeamus&quot; (&quot;let us dare&quot;).
The university's graduation song <em>Gaudeamus igitur, iuvenes dum sumus...</em> (&quot;Let us rejoice, while we are young&quot;) acknowledges students will continue to live up to the challenge if not always in the way intended.
Between 1874 and 1961 the University of Otago was a part of the <a>University of New Zealand</a>, and issued degrees in its name.</p>
<p>Otago graduates are among the most dispersed university alumni in the world, due in part to New Zealand being considered a relatively good destination by many Asian students and with the greater variety of jobs, opportunities and salaries on offer overseas for New Zealand students graduating from an established university.
Many graduates ultimately settle in <a>Australia</a>, <a>the United Kingdom</a>, <a>Ireland</a>, <a>Canada</a>, <a>the United States</a>, <a>China</a>, <a>Malaysia</a>, <a>India</a>, <a>Sri Lanka</a>, <a>South Korea</a>, <a>Japan</a>, <a>Singapore</a> or parts of <a>New Zealand</a> beyond <a>Otago</a>.
<a>Otago</a> is known for its student life, particularly its <a>flatting</a>.
The nickname <a>Scarfie</a> comes from the habit of wearing a scarf during cold southern winters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:University of Otago.jpg|thumb|The
[[University of Otago Registry Building|University clocktower]], looking east.]]</p>
<p>The Otago Association's plan for the European settlement of southern New Zealand, conceived under the principles of <a>Edward Gibbon Wakefield</a> in the 1840s, envisaged a university.</p>
<p>Dunedin leaders Thomas Burns and <a>James Macandrew</a> urged the Otago Provincial Council during the 1860s to set aside a land endowment for an institute of higher education.
An ordinance of the council established the university in 1869, giving it  of land and the power to grant degrees in Arts, Medicine, Law and Music.
Burns was named Chancellor but he did not live to see the university open on 5 July 1871.
<a>Ethel Benjamin</a> graduated LLB in 1897.
Later that year she became the first woman in the British Empire to appear as counsel in court.</p>
<p>Professor <a>Robert Jack</a> made the first radio broadcast in New Zealand from the physics department on 17 November 1921.</p>
<p>Because it had a wider range of courses than New Zealand's other university institutions Otago attracted more students from outside its provincial district.
This led to the growth of colleges and informal accommodation in north Dunedin around the faculty buildings.
This development of a residential campus gave Otago a more vibrant undergraduate student life at the same time as comparable but smaller developments in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland were eclipsed in the late 20th century.
Otago now has the most substantial residential campus of any university in New Zealand or Australia, although this is not without its problems.</p>
<p>In May 2010 University joined the <a>Matariki Network of Universities</a> (MNU) together with <a>Dartmouth College</a> (USA), <a>Durham University</a> (UK), <a>Queen&#x2019;s University</a> (Canada), <a>University of T&#x00fc;bingen</a> (Germany), <a>University of Western Australia</a> (Australia) and <a>Uppsala University</a> (Sweden).</p>
<h2>Faculties</h2>
<p>[[File:Polaris II University of Otago.jpg|thumb|right|The
university's research vessel Polaris II entering [[Otago Harbour]]]] Administratively, the university is divided into four divisions: Commerce, Health Sciences, Humanities and Sciences.
For external and marketing purposes, the Division of Commerce is known as the School of Business, as that is the term commonly used for its equivalent in North America.
Historically, there were a number of Schools and Faculties, which have now been grouped with stand alone departments to form these divisions.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual university disciplines, the <a>Otago Medical School</a> (founded 1875) is one of only two in New Zealand (with constituent branches in <a>Christchurch</a> and <a>Wellington</a>), and Otago is the only university in the country to offer training in Dentistry.
Other professional schools and faculties not found in all New Zealand universities include Pharmacy, Physical Education, Physiotherapy, Medical Laboratory Science, and Surveying.
It was also home to the School of Mines, until this was transferred to the <a>University of Auckland</a> in 1987.
Theology is also offered, traditionally in conjunction with the <a>School of Ministry, Knox College</a>, and <a>Holy Cross College, Mosgiel</a>.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>In addition to the main Dunedin campus, the University has small facilities in <a>Auckland</a> and Wellington (based at the Wellington Centre).
The medical schools have larger campuses near Christchurch and Wellington Hospitals.
Additionally, the university has the <a>Portobello Marine Laboratory</a> inside Otago Harbour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>;Merger with Dunedin College of Education</p>
<p>The University and the <a>Dunedin College of Education</a> (a specialist teacher training institution) merged on 1 January 2007.
The <em>University of Otago College of Education</em> is now based on the College site, and includes the College's campuses in <a>Invercargill</a> and <a>Alexandra</a>.
Staff of the University's Faculty of Education relocated to the college site.
A merger had been considered before, however the present talks progressed further, and more amicably, than previously.</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Interior of Central Library.</a>
The University of Otago has ten libraries &#x2013; seven based in Dunedin on the main university campus, the Education library in Southland, plus two medical libraries in Wellington and Christchurch.
All libraries have wireless access.</p>
<p>The Central Library is part of the Information Services Building and has over 2000 study spaces.
It has the M&#x0101;ori Resources Collection Te Aka a T&#x0101;whaki, a collection pertaining to Te Ao M&#x0101;ori, and the Special Collections consisting of about 9,000 books printed before 1801.</p>
<p>The Health Sciences libraries are the Medical Library in the Sayers Building, and the Dental library on the ground floor of the Dental School.
The Medical Library contains 150,000 volumes including 79,000 books, and receives over 1,600 periodicals.
The Dental book collection consists of 2000 volumes.</p>
<p>The Science Library is at the north end of the campus in the Science III building, with seating for approximately 500.</p>
<p>Other libraries are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Hocken Library</a></li>
  <li><a>Sir Robert Stout Law Library</a></li>

<p>The 2006 Government investigation into research quality (to serve as a basis for future funding) ranked Otago the top University in New Zealand overall, taking into account the quality of its staff and research produced.
It was also ranked first in the categories of Clinical Medicine, Biomedical Science, Law, English Literature and Language, History and Earth Science.
The Department of Philosophy received the highest score for any nominated academic unit.
Otago had been ranked fourth in the 2004 assessment.</p>
<p>In 2006, a report released by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology found that Otago was the most research intensive university in New Zealand, with 40% of staff time devoted to research and development.</p>
<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked Otago 135th overall in the world, making it the second highest ranked university in New Zealand.
In 2009, Otago was ranked 125th from a listing of top 200 institutions in the <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings) and in 2006 within 201&#x2013;300 in the Shanghai Jiaotong rankings of world top 500 universities.

<h2>Residential colleges</h2>
<p> [[Image:St Margarets College University of Otago.jpg|thumb|[[St
Margaret's College, Otago|St Margaret's College]] affiliated to the University of Otago]] The University of Otago owns, or is in affiliation with, fourteen <a>residential college</a>s, which provide food, accommodation, social and welfare services.
Most of these cater primarily for first year students, though some have a sizable number of second and higher year undergraduates, as well as occasionally a significant postgraduate population.
While some teaching is normally undertaken at a college, this generally represents a small percentage of a resident's formal tuition.</p>
<p>Most colleges actively seek to foster a sense of community and academic achievement amongst their members through, variously, intercollegiate competitions, communal dining, apartment groups, traditionalism, independent students' clubs, college events and internal sporting and cultural societies.</p>
<p>Some colleges are co-institutional, accepting students from both the University of Otago and <a>Otago Polytechnic</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>O-Week</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Participants in the annual clocktower race lining up, ready to go.</a></p>
<p>'O-Week' or <em>Orientation Week</em> is the Otago equivalent of Fresher's Week.
While the new students are sometimes referred to as 'freshers' the label of 'first years' is more common.
O-week is organised by the <a>Otago University Students' Association</a> and involves competitions such as 'Fresher of the Year' whereby several students volunteer to carry out a series of tasks throughout the week before being voted to win.
All tasks are related to the O-Week theme.
The OUSA also organise events each night including various concerts, a comedy night, hypnotist plus busses to <a>Carisbrook</a> (at the other end of Dunedin) where the <a>Highlanders</a> usually schedule a game.
Local bars organise events also with a range of live music and promotional deals including the Cookathon and a Miss O-Week competition hosted by The Outback.
The Cookathon was held by a local pub (the Cook) with the premise that your first drink costs you about $20 which gives you a t-shirt, three meal vouchers and reduced price on drinks then you spend the rest of the day binge drinking and 'telephoning' the occasional jug with mates.
A clocktower race also occurs, in the style of <em><a>Chariots of Fire</a></em>.
Students must race round the tower and attached building, beginning on the first chime of the clock at noon and completing before the chimes cease.
Unlike <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, the task is possible with a couple of students completing each year.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The gutted remains of a burnt out couch on Queen Street</a></p>
<p>;Themes Previously each year a theme was chosen for the O-week festivities, usually based on a recent movie or TV show.
The week was then branded with altered posters depicting the theme plus all events were somehow linked to the theme.
This practice ended in 2008.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Supersize Me</a> &#x2013; 2005</li>
  <li><a>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> &#x2013; 2006</li>
  <li><a>Prison Break</a> &#x2013; 2007</li>
  <li>Orientation '08 &#x2013; 2008</li>
  <li>Orientation '09 &#x2013; 2009</li>
</ul>
<h3>Behavioural issues</h3>
<p>Student behaviour is a major concern for both the University administration and Dunedin residents in general.
Concerns over student behaviour prompted the University to introduce a Code of Conduct (CoC) which its students must abide by in 2007.
The introduction of the CoC was accompanied by the establishment of the dedicated 'Campus Watch' security force to keep tabs on crime and anti-social behaviour on campus and in the student neighbourhoods nearby.
Campus Watch reports directly to the University's Proctor.</p>
<p>;Couch burning Couch burning is a frequent, <a>illegal</a>, problem with partying students in the student neighbourhood surrounding the campus.
In 2007, a pub owner was charged with <a>sedition</a> over a pamphlet offering O-Week students the prize of a fuel-soaked couch.</p>
<p>;Riots Large scale clashes between Otago and Canterbury University students and Police took place in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 related to events surrounding the <a>Undie 500</a> car rally organised by students from Canterbury University.
Other student social events during the year such as the Toga Parade and the Hyde Street Keg Race are also notable for attracting Police attention, but not to the scale of the Undie riots.</p>
<p>;Protest Otago students are notable for protesting contentious political issues in nearly every decade.
In the 1960s students at Otago who were involved with the <a>Progressive Youth Movement</a> led protests against the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
In the 1970s mixed flatting (males and females were prohibited from sharing housing up to that time) was contested in various creative ways by Otago students.
On 28 September 1993 Otago students protested against a fee increase at the university, going as far as occupying the University Registry (Clocktower Building), which ended in a violent clash with police.
Since 2004, the <a>Otago University NORML</a> club has met weekly on the Otago campus to protest by smoking cannabis in defiance of New Zealand's cannabis laws.
In 2008, several members were arrested and issued trespass notices from the Union Lawn, but the protests continue to this day.</pre>
