<p></p>
<p><strong>Augsburg College</strong> is a selective <a>liberal arts</a> college of the <a>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> located in <a>Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>.
It was founded in 1869 in <a>Marshall, Wisconsin</a> as Augsburg <a>Seminary</a> and moved to Minneapolis in 1872.
Undergraduate classes first began in the fall of 1874 with the first class graduating in the spring of 1879 In 1893 Augsburg leaders formed the &quot;Friends of Augsburg&quot;, which became the <a>Lutheran Free Church</a> in 1897.
Women were first admitted to the college in 1921.
The school was officially known as <strong>Augsburg Seminary</strong> until 1942 when the name was changed to <strong>Augsburg College and Theological Seminary</strong> although that name had been informally used since the 1910s.
When the Lutheran Free Church merged with the <a>American Lutheran Church</a> in 1963 Augsburg Seminary merged with <a>Luther Seminary</a> in <a>Saint Paul</a> and the name of the school officially became <strong>Augsburg College</strong>.
There was also a high school level <strong>Augsburg Academy</strong> on campus until it closed in 1933.
Augsburg was named for the <a>Augsburg Confession</a>, the document of Lutheran belief.</p>
<h2>A Lutheran college in the city</h2>
<p>Augsburg College is located in the center of <a>Minneapolis</a> close to <a>St.
Paul</a> with programs in <a>Rochester</a> and <a>Bloomington</a> as well.
</p>
<p>As the <a>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>'s (ELCA) most diverse college of the liberal arts and sciences, Augsburg strives to educate both traditional and <a>non-traditional student</a>s, offering undergraduate degrees in over 50 major areas of study.
The College also grants six graduate degrees: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a>Master of Arts in Education</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a>Master of Arts in Leadership</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a>Master in Business Administration</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a>Master of Social Work</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a>Master of Arts in Nursing</a>, and</li>
  <li>the <a>Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies</a>, the state's only Physician Assistant training program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Majors in the Sciences, Business-related fields, and the teacher licensure program &ndash; which has been preparing K&#x2013;12 teachers since 1923 &ndash; are the most popular areas of study.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>Augsburg's student body totals approximately 3,800 students.
Reflecting its Minnesota location and historical roots, 88.5% of students are white, and 32% of students are Lutheran; approximately 90% come from inside Minnesota.
However, the College makes strong attempts to diversify its student body and has a range of students from diverse religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, representing some 40 states, more than 40 foreign countries, and 24 tribal nations/reservations.
The College also is a nationally recognized leader in providing services to students with physical or learning disabilities, and to students in recovery through its acclaimed &#x201c;StepUP Program&#x201d; (see below).
This on-campus diversity is enhanced by Augsburg's location in the <a>Cedar-Riverside</a> neighborhood, the Twin Cities' most culturally diverse neighborhood.
The largest concentration of <a>Somali</a> immigrants in the U.S. is located throughout the Augsburg neighborhood, and one of the largest urban <a>Native American</a> populations is within one mile.
The College has been designated as a Minnesota Indian Teacher Training Program site.
The College's location also provides access for all of Augsburg's students to participate in community service, such as through <a>Campus Kitchen</a>, and internship experiences that not only enhance their classroom learning but also prepare them for life's work in a multi-cultural society.</p>
<h3>StepUP Program</h3>
<p>The <strong>StepUp Program</strong> is Augsburg's nationally-acclaimed program for students in recovery from drug and alcohol abuse.
The program provides a sober environment for about 60 students in the Oren Gateway Center (see below).
The program has an excellent success rate: 84% abstinence over 538 people between 1997 and 2007.</p>
<h2>Opportunities on campus</h2>
<p>Augsburg's location in the heart of a major theater center makes it an ideal place to study theater arts.
Students have the opportunity to explore the connections between theory and application through an annual series of events featuring visiting theater professionals from throughout the Twin Cities and at attendance and internships at Twin Cities theaters.</p>
<h3>Campus organizations</h3>
<p>Augsburg students have opportunities for involvement in more than 50 clubs and organizations, including student academic societies, publications, Student Government, Augsburg Business Organization, Campus Ministry, Augsburg College Pre-law Society, Pan-Afrikan and Pan-Asian Student Union, forensics, cheerleading, Amnesty International, Intertribal Student Union and the Hispanic/Latino Student Association.</p>

<h2>Buildings and facilities</h2>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Urness Hall</em> is the Freshman dorm building.
It has 9 floors of dorm rooms (plus two other floors) and is coed by floor.
Each floor is led by a Resident Advisor.</li>
<li><em>Mortensen Hall</em> (known as <em>Mort</em>) is connected to the <em>Urness</em> lobby and has 13 floors of apartment style housing (eight apartments on every floor).

As it is no longer the newest building with the completion of <em>Oren</em> (see below), the old name of <em>New Hall</em> is misleading.
