<p> The <strong>University of British Columbia</strong> (<strong>UBC</strong>) is a <a>Canadian</a> <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> with campuses in the Greater <a>Vancouver</a> area and in <a>Kelowna</a>, <a>British Columbia</a>.
The 402-hectare (993-acre) main campus in the <a>Greater Vancouver</a> area is located in the <a>University Endowment Lands</a> on <a>Point Grey</a>, a peninsula about 10&nbsp;km from downtown Vancouver, with smaller speciality and satellite campuses located at Great Northern Way and Robson Street, both in <a>Vancouver</a> proper.
the first day of lectures was September 30, 1915.
On September 22, 1925, lectures began on the new Point Grey campus.
The enabling legislation are the <em>University Act</em>  and the <em>University Amendment Act, 2004</em>.</p>
<p>The university is the oldest in British Columbia and has the largest enrolment with over 41,000 students at its Vancouver and Okanagan campuses combined.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, UBC placed 2nd in Canada, and 36th in the world.</pre>
<p>The 2010 Times Higher Education Rankings ranked UBC at 30th in the world, and also 2nd highest in Canada.
In 2010, <a>QS World University Rankings</a> placed the university at 44th, the 3rd highest ranked in Canada.</p>
<p>The UBC library, which comprises 5.9 million books and journals, is the second-largest research library in Canada.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumbnail|left|The Chemistry building, one of UBC's oldest, on a summer evening</a></p>
<h3>Establishment of a provincial university</h3>
<p>A provincial university was first called into being by the <a>British Columbia University Act</a> of 1908, although its location was not yet specified.
The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.
helped to establish the McGill University College of British Columbia.
From 1906 to 1915 McGill BC (as it was called) operated as a private institution providing the first few years toward a degree at McGill University or elsewhere.
The Henry Marshall Tory Medal was established in 1941 by <a>Henry Marshall Tory</a> (1864&ndash;1947), FRSC, founding President of the University of Alberta and of the National Research Council of Canada, and a co-founder of Carlton University.</p>
<p>In the meantime, appeals were again made to the government to revive the earlier legislation for a provincial institution, leading to the University Endowment Act in 1907, and The University Act in 1908.
In 1910 the Point Grey site was chosen, and the government appointed Dr. <a>Frank Fairchild Wesbrook</a> as President in 1913.
A declining economy and the outbreak of war in August 1914 compelled the University to postpone plans for building at Point Grey, and instead the former McGill University College site at <a>Fairview</a> became home to the University until 1925.
The first day of lectures was September 30, 1915, the new university absorbing McGill University College.
University of British Columbia awarded its first degrees in 1916..
There were 576 male students and 386 female students in the 1920&ndash;21 winter session, but only 64 academic staff, including 6 women.</p>
<p>In the early part of the twentieth century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine.
UBC provided no degrees in these areas, but was beginning to offer degrees in new professional areas such as engineering, agriculture, nursing, and school teaching.
Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced, with students completing M.A. degrees in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.</pre>
<p><a>Military training</a> on the campus became popular, then mandatory.
WWII marked the first provision of money from the <a>federal government</a> to the University for research purposes.
By the end of the war, it became clear that the facilities at Point Grey had become totally inadequate to cater to the huge influx of veterans returning to their studies.
The University needed new staff, new courses, new faculties, and new buildings for teaching and accommodation.
The student population rose from 2,974 in 1944&ndash;45 to 9,374 in 1947&ndash;48.
Surplus <a>Army</a> and <a>Air Force</a> camps were used for both classrooms and accommodation.
Fifteen complete camps were taken over by the University in the course of the 1945&ndash;46 session alone, with a sixteenth camp situated on <a>Little Mountain</a> in Vancouver, converted into suites for married students.
Most of the camps were dismantled and carried by barge or truck to the University where the huts were scattered across the campus.
(A few huts remain in place today!)</p>
<p>Student numbers hit 9,374 in 1948; more than 53% of the students were <a>war veterans</a> in 1947&ndash;67.
Between 1947 and 1951 twenty new permanent buildings were erected.</p>
<p>The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) and War Memorial Gym are landmark buildings on the campus of the University of British Columbia.
The lecture hall, theatre and gym honour students who had enlisted and died in the <a>First World War</a>, and in the <a>Second World War</a>.
</p>
<p>The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities &#x2014; the <a>University of Victoria</a> was established in 1963.
The [[University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus|UBC Okanagan]] campus is led by Dr. Doug Owram, Deputy Vice-Chancellor.</pre>
<p>All three founding faculties remain, but the Faculty of Agriculture is now known as the Faculty of Land &amp; Food Systems.</p>
<h2>Governance and academics</h2>
<p>The administration of UBC, as mandated by the University Act, is composed of a chancellor, convocation, board, senate, and faculties of the university .
The Board of Governors is responsible for the management of property and revenue, while the Senate is vested with managing the academic operation of the university.
Both are composed of faculty and students who are elected to the position.
Degrees and diplomas are conferred by the convocation, which is composed of alumni, administrators, and faculty, with a quorum of twenty members.
UBC also has a President, who is a chief executive officer of the university and a member of the Senate, Board of Governors, Convocation, and also serves as Vice Chancellor.
The President of the University is responsible for managing the academic operation of the university, including recommending appointments, calling meetings of faculties, and establishing committees.</pre>
<h3>Faculties and Schools</h3>
<p> UBC's academic activity is organized into &quot;faculties&quot;, and &quot;schools&quot;.
Currently, UBC has twelve faculties and eleven schools on its Vancouver campus and eight faculties and five schools at its Okanagan campus ).
The founding of the new Okanagan campus will increase these numbers dramatically.
The university is one of only two Canadian universities to have membership in <a>Universitas 21</a>, an international association of research-led institutions (<a>McGill University</a> is the other).
</p>
<h3>Quality of education</h3>
<p> UBC consistently ranks as one of the top three Canadian universities by Research InfoSource and ranks thirtieth in the world (second in Canada) in the 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and thirty-sixth in the world (second in Canada) in the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.
The <a>QS World University Rankings</a> (recently splitting from a joint world university rankings study with the <a>Times Higher Education</a>) ranked UBC as third in Canada and forty-fourth in the world in 2010.
According to <a>Maclean's</a> University Rankings, UBC has the highest percentage of Ph.
D level professors among all public universities in North America (92%).
It has received widespread recognition by Maclean's and <a>Newsweek</a> magazines for its <a>foreign language</a> program; the Chinese program is North America's largest, and the Japanese program is North America's second largest (after the <a>University of Hawaii</a>).
The Department of Economics as well as the Engineering Department are constantly ranked Top 20 in the World.
The Department of Art History, Visual Arts and Theory has been recognized consistently for the world-class artists who teach there.
In 2003 the National Post stated UBC had the highest entrance requirements for undergraduate admission out of all universities in Canada.</p>
<h3>Research centres and institutes</h3>
<p>UBC, with a research budget among the top three among Canadian universities, runs many research centres and institutions.
UBC operates the <a>Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre</a> on Vancouver Island for research biologists, ecologists and oceanographers.
As a founding member of the Western Canadian Universities Marine Sciences Society, UBC maintains this field station on the west coast of Vancouver Island, which is jointly run by the <a>University of Victoria</a>, <a>Simon Fraser University</a>, the <a>University of Alberta</a> and the <a>University of Calgary</a>.
The <a>Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies</a> is an interdisciplinary research institute for fundamental research in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities.
The <a>UBC Farm</a> is a 24 hectare learning and research farm located in UBC's South Campus area is the only working farmland within the city of Vancouver.
The farm features Saturday Farm Markets from early June until early October, selling organic produce and eggs to the community.</p>
<h4>TRIUMF</h4>
<p> TRIUMF is Canada&#x2019;s national laboratory for <a>particle</a> and <a>nuclear physics</a> located at UBC.
The name was formerly an acronym for TRI-University Meson Facility, but TRIUMF is now owned and operated by a consortium of eleven Canadian universities.
The consortium runs TRIUMF through a contribution of funds from the <a>National Research Council of Canada</a>, and makes TRIUMF&#x2019;s facilities available to Canadian scientists and to scientists from around the world.
TRIUMF also houses the world's largest cyclotron.</p>
<h3>Aboriginal</h3>
<p>The UBC&#x2019;s Longhouse is a dedicated space for <a>Aboriginal</a> institutions, a &#x201c;zone of comfort&#x201d; for Aboriginal students and a focus for Aboriginal culture and activities on campus.
UBC has an Associate Dean of Indigenous Education and offers degrees in First Nations Studies through a program in the Arts Faculty.
The UBC&#x2019;s First Nations Forestry Initiatives was developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet specific needs within more remote Aboriginal communities.
UBC also offers a Chinook Diploma Program in the Sauder School of Business.
UBC also runs the Chinook Summer Biz Camp, which seeks fosters entrepreneurship among First Nations and M&#x00e9;tis high school students.
UBC hosts a Bridge Through Sport Program, Summer Science Program, Native Youth Program, and Cedar Day Camp and Afterschool Program.
UBC has had success in recruiting and retaining Aboriginal faculty.
UBC developed governing board and senate policies as well as Aboriginal governed councils within the university structure.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>For 2006&ndash;2007, UBC had expected a $36 million deficit.
With various cost cutting measures, the University posted a small surplus of $1.92 million.
As of March 2007, UBC had assets of $3.2 billion and liabilities of $1.8 billion.
Total revenue for 2006&ndash;2007 was $1.59 billion, of which 36% came from the provincial government, 11% from the federal government, 17% from &quot;sales of goods and services&quot;, 18% from tuition, and 18% from all other sources.
Total expenses were $1.50 billion, of which salaries, wages, benefits, and honoraria were 59%, office supplies and expenses were 12%, amortization was 9%, and all other expenses were 20%.
Less than 1% of expenses went to fundraising.</p>
<h3>Tuition</h3>
<p>In 2001&ndash;02, UBC had one of the lowest undergraduate <a>tuition</a> rates in Canada, at an average of $2,181 CAD per year for a full-time programme.
This was due to a government-instituted tuition freeze.
In 2001, however, the BC Liberal party defeated the NDP in British Columbia and lifted the tuition freeze.
In 2002&ndash;03 undergraduate and graduate tuition rose by an average of 30%, and by up to 40% in some faculties.
This has led to better facilities, but also to <a>student unrest</a> and contributed to a teaching assistant <a>union strike</a>.</p>
<p>UBC again increased tuition by 30% in the 2003&ndash;04 year, again by approximately 15% in the 2004&ndash;05 season, and 2% in the 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07 years.
Increases were lower than expected because, in the 2005 <a>Speech from the Throne</a>, the government announced that tuition increases would be capped to inflation.
Despite these increases, UBC's tuition remains below the national average and below other universities in the regions.
In 2006&ndash;07, the Canadian average undergraduate tuition fee was $4,347 and the BC average was $4,960.
UBC tuition for 2007&ndash;2008 was $4,257 for a Canadian student in a basic 30-unit program, though various programs cost from $3,406 to $9,640.</p>
<p>Tuition for international students is significantly higher (2.3&#x2013;4.6
times higher than domestic students).
In 2009, tuition for international students ranged from $16,245 CAD to $25,721 CAD.</p>
<h2>Campuses and features</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Aerial View of the Vancouver Campus</a></p>
<h3>Vancouver</h3>
<p> The Vancouver campus is located at <a>Point Grey</a>, a twenty-minute drive from downtown Vancouver.
It is near several beaches and has views of the <a>North Shore mountains</a>.
The 7.63&nbsp;km&#x00b2; <a>Pacific Spirit Regional Park</a> serves as a green-belt between the campus and the city.
Buildings on the Vancouver campus currently occupy 1,091,997 m&#x00b2; gross, located on 1.7&nbsp;km&#x00b2; of maintained land.
The Vancouver campus' street plan is mostly in a grid of malls (for driving and pedestrian-only).
Lower Mall and West Mall are in the southwestern part of the peninsula, with Main, East, and Wesbrook Malls northeast of them.
Wireless Internet access is available at no charge to students, faculty, and staff inside and outside of most buildings at both campuses.</p>
<p>The <a>University Endowment Lands</a> are not within Vancouver's city limits, and as such UBC is policed by the <a>RCMP</a> rather than the <a>Vancouver Police Department</a>.
However, the <a>Vancouver Fire Department</a> does provide service to UBC under a contract.
Also, all postage sent to any building on campus includes Vancouver in the address.&lt;!--&quot;Postal Station E or G&quot;--&gt;  UBC Vancouver also has two satellite campuses within the City of Vancouver: a campus at <a>Vancouver General Hospital</a> for the medical sciences, and UBC <a>Robson Square</a> in downtown Vancouver for part-time credit and non-credit programmes.
Moreover, UBC is also a partner in the consortium backing <a>Great Northern Way Campus Ltd</a>.
UBC is affiliated with a group of adjacent theological colleges, which include the <a>Vancouver School of Theology</a>, <a>Regent College</a>, <a>Carey Theological College</a> and the <a>Corpus Christi College</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:Nitobe Gardens, zig-zag bridge.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Devil-losing
bridge&quot; and iris pond in [[Nitobe Memorial Garden]]]] The campus is also home to numerous gardens.
The <a>UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research</a>, the first UBC department, holds a collection of over 8000 different kinds of plants used for research, conservation and education.
The original site of the UBC botanical garden was at the &quot;Old Arboretum&quot;.
Today all that remains of it are trees planted in 1916 by <a>John Davidson</a>.
The old arboretum is now home to many buildings including the First Nations House of Learning.
The <a>Nitobe Memorial Garden</a>, built to honour <a>Japan</a>ese scholar <a>Inazo Nitobe</a>, the garden has been the subject of more than fifteen years' study by a UBC professor, who believes that its construction hides a number of impressive features, including references to Japanese philosophy and mythology, shadow bridges visible only at certain times of year, and positioning of a lantern that is filled with light at the exact date and time of Nitobe's death each year.
The garden is behind the university's Asian Centre, which is built from steel girders from Japan's exhibit at <a>Osaka Expo</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a> The campus also features the <a>Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a>: a <a>performing arts</a> centre containing the <a>Chan Shun Concert Hall</a>, Telus Studio Theatre and the Royal Bank Cinema.
It is often the location of convocation ceremonies as well as the filming location for the <a>4400 Center</a> on the television show <em><a>The 4400</a></em>, as well as the Madacorp entrance set on <em><a>Kyle XY</a></em>.
It has also been featured as the Cloud 9 Ballroom in the re-imagined <em><a>Battlestar Galactica</a></em> (Season 1, Episode 11: <em>Colonial Day</em>).
It has also been used in <em><a>Stargate Atlantis</a></em> (Season 2, Episode 5: <em>Condemned</em>), as well as in the first season of <em><a>Reaper</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Okanagan</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|UBC's Okanagan campus</a>   The <a>Okanagan Campus</a>, is located on the former North Kelowna Campus of <a>Okanagan University College</a>, adjacent to <a>Kelowna International Airport</a> on the north-east side of <a>Kelowna</a>, British Columbia.
This campus offers undergraduate degrees in Arts, Science, Nursing, Education, Management and Engineering as well as graduate degrees in most of these disciplines.
The Okanagan campus is experiencing a $450 million CDN rapid expansion with construction of several new residential, teaching and research buildings now underway.</p>
<p>In 2010, UBC Okanagan campus is planned to double in size from current 105 ha. to 208.6 ha.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The UBC Library, which comprises 5.8 million books and journals, 5.3 million microforms, over 833,000 maps, videos and other multimedia materials and over 46,700 subscriptions, is the second largest research library in Canada.
The libraries lent out over 2.5 million print works in 2008/2009 with over 2.9 million visits to the library (measured by gate counters).
The library has twenty-one branches and divisions at UBC and at other locations, including three branches at teaching hospitals (<a>St.
Paul's Hospital</a>, <a>Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre</a>, <a>BC Children's Hospital</a>), one at UBC's <a>Robson Square</a> campus in downtown Vancouver, and one at the UBC's <a>Okanagan Campus</a>.</p>
<p>Major General <a>Victor Odlum</a> CB, CMG, DSO, VD donated his personal library of 10,000 books, which has been housed in &quot;the Rockwoods Centre Library&quot; of the UBC library since 1963.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student representation</h3>
<p> <strong>UBC Vancouver</strong> students are represented by the Alma Mater Society, or AMS.
The society's mandate is to improve the quality of educational, social, and personal lives of UBC students.
The executive &ndash; composed of the President; Vice President, External Affairs; Vice President, Administration; Vice President, Finance; and Vice President, Academic and University Affairs &ndash; are responsible for lobbying the UBC administration on behalf of the student body, providing services, such as the AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, supporting and administering student clubs, and maintaining the Student Union Building (aka SUB) and the services it houses.
Graduate Students are represented by the Graduate Student Society (GSS).
Recently, the AMS has undertaken an initiative to construct a new Student Union Building (SUB) with a cost of $110 million, of which $80 million is paid by student fees, with 50% more space compared to the current SUB.
Construction is slated to begin in 2012.</p>
<p><strong><a>UBC Okanagan</a></strong> students are represented by The University of British Columbia Students' Union &ndash; Okanagan.
<a>thumb|right|Orientation day for first year students at UBC Okanagan.</a></p>
<h3>Student facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|500px|center|The Student Union Building on the left, and the War Memorial Gym on the right.
The red trees are typical of autumn.</a>
<a>thumb|right|University Centre at UBC Okanagan.</a>
The heart of student activity at UBC Vancouver is the centrally located Student Union Building, which houses offices of many <a>club</a>s, half a dozen <a>restaurant</a>s and caf&#x00e9;s, a pub (&quot;The Gallery&quot;), a nightclub (&quot;The Pit&quot;), the inexpensive 425-seat Norman Bouchard Memorial Theatre (&quot;The Norm Theatre&quot;), several shops and a post office.
The majority of the outlets and shops in the SUB are run by the AMS, however the addition of major corporate outlets in recent years by UBC Food Services has generated some controversy.
The SUB Art Gallery contains mostly students' work.
Beside the SUB, there is a small mound called The Grassy Knoll, which was constructed from the contents of the open pool dug near the Aquatic Centre.
The Grassy Knoll was slated to be removed for the planned construction of an underground bus loop.
However, on October 28, 2009, UBC was advised by Translink that due to its current funding levels it would not be able to provide funds for the construction of the bus loop.
As a result, the bus loop project has been cancelled by the administration, although the rest of the renovations of the University Boulevard Neighbourhood are still under consideration.</p>
<p>Other student facilities on campus include the Ladha Science Student Centre, which was funded through a donation from Abdul Ladha, a levy from all Science undergraduate students, the VP Students, and the Dean of Science, and the Meekison Arts Student Space, which is located in the Faculty of Art's Buchanan D building.</p>
<h3>Greek organizations</h3>
<p>While UBC's Greek system is somewhat smaller than its counterparts in the United States, it does offer the largest and most active Greek system in Canada.
There is a total of 18 Greek organizations.
An InterFraternal Council (IFC) is recognized as a club by the Alma Mater Society and meetings of the fraternities under IFC occur at their respective fraternity houses each week.
Greek life has its own division within <a>UBC REC</a> and intense competition between the 9 Fraternities for the title of top Athletic Fraternity occur.
Alpha Delta Phi currently holds the title of IFC Intramural Champions.</p>
<p>The National Panhellenic Council (NPC) sororities on campus are overseen by the Panhellenic Council.
All sororities have a chapter room in the Panhellenic House on Wesbrook Mall; the building also offers housing for 72 college women, with preference given to sorority members.
<a>Phrateres</a> is not an official part of the Greek Organization on campus, but interacts with the fraternities on a similar basis as the sororities.
Phrateres is an official AMS club and thus does not bar membership to male members, although it is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>There are nine international fraternities on campus, the first of which was Alpha Delta Phi in 1926.
However Alpha Delta Phi was preceded by several local fraternities on campus.
Other fraternities include Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, Sigma Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, and Kappa Sigma.</p>
<p>Beta Theta Pi is the only fraternity on campus not in the Greek Village.
They retained their own land on the old Fraternity Row which is closer to campus than the Greek Village.
Alpha Epsilon Pi has no house, but plans are underway to provide them the lower level of the newly constructed Hillel House.
The Greek Village shares a common underground parking lot and is managed jointly.
All the houses on campus were constructed sometime between 2002 and 2003 including Beta Theta Pi.
This came about as an agreement between many parties to sell the previous leased land to a development camp.</p>
<p>The seven sororities on campus include Alpha Delta Pi, Delta Gamma, Alpha Gamma Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Alpha Phi, Gamma Phi Beta and Kappa Alpha Theta.
The Panhellenic Total for UBC campus is 65, so each sorority has around that number of girls.
Chapter meetings are held in the chapter's respective rooms each week and Greek-wide or campus-wide events are attended by members of all the sororities and fraternities.
In the fall of 2010, an 8th sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi, will be re-colonizing at UBC campus.</p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Gage Towers</a> <a>thumb|left|Dene House at Totem Park</a> <a>thumb|left|Marine Drive</a> According to a 2009 UBC Student Housing Study, UBC currently provides approximately 8680 beds on the Point Grey campus for an on-campus student population of about 11,000 people.
The UBC administration has recognized the need for more student housing on campus, forecasting the need for 6400 new beds on campus within the next 20 years, and has expanded housing recently with the opening of the Marine Drive towers and the MBA house residence on South Campus.

<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are: &quot;Hail, U.B.C&quot; with words and music by Harold King and &quot;High on Olympus&quot; with words by D.C. Morton and music by J.C.F.
Haeffner.</p>
<h3>Campus events</h3>
<p>A small number of large-scale, campus-wide events occur annually at UBC which are organized by university institutions, the AMS, and student constituencies of various faculties and departments.
UBC Orientations organizes several events for first year students, such as Imagine UBC, GALA, and UBC Jump Start.
Imagine UBC is an orientation day and <a>pep rally</a> for first-year undergraduate students that replaces the first day of September classes at UBC Vancouver.</p>
<p>Several athletic events take place at UBC every year.
Storm the Wall is an <a>intramural</a> relay race put on by <a>UBC REC</a> in April, culminating in the climbing of a  wall.
It is one of the largest intramural events to take place regularly in Canada.
Day of the Longboat is an <a>intramural</a> event put on at the end of September/early October by <a>UBC REC</a>.
It is the largest voyageur canoe race in North America, with teams competing in a challenging 2&nbsp;km paddle around the waters of Jericho Sailing Centre.</p>
<p>Faculty constituencies, such as the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) and Science Undergraduate Society (SUS), hold events annually.
Many of the major constituencies, such as for Arts, Science, and Engineering, hold their own faculty weeks to celebrate their faculties.
The events may include keynote speeches, merchandise sales, and dances.
Arts County Fair was an annual <a>concert</a> and party on the last day of classes in April, put on by the AUS and occurring at <a>Thunderbird Stadium.</a>
Past headliners have included <a>Sam Roberts</a>, <a>The New Pornographers</a>, and <a>Metric</a>.
Due to increasing financial difficulties (mostly resulting from mounting security and related costs) the AUS announced they would not continue the event in 2008.
In its place, the Alma Mater Society of UBC hosted the AMS Block Party to celebrate the end of classes.</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of unofficial 'traditions,' exist at UBC: jumping from the UBC Aquatic Centre's outdoor 10-metre diving board late at night; and frequent repainting of the Engineering <a>cairn</a>, refashioning its large red-and-white 'E' into other letters representative of other faculties, clubs, and groups.</p>
