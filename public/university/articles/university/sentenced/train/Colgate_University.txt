Nearly all the buildings on campus are built of stone, and newer buildings are built with materials that fit the style.
Probably the most distinctive building on campus is the Chapel (Colgate Memorial Chapel), which was built in 1918 and is used for lectures, performances, concerts, and religious services.
<a>Old Biology Hall</a> was built in 1884 and added to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Housing and student life facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|East and West Halls, the oldest residential halls of the university</a> Colgate has ten residence halls located on its central campus, which is often referred to as &quot;up the hill.&quot;
Located near the academic buildings, freshmen live in six of these halls, whereas sophomores live in the other four, or in townhouses or one house on Broad Street.
Juniors and seniors live down the hill in a number of residences, such as theme houses on Broad Street, apartment complexes or in &quot;townhouses&quot; located further away from campus.
Themed houses are available for students who want to explore their interests.
The Creative Arts house is geared towards creative students; Asia House is for students with interests in Asian culture.
Although the university provides housing for students all four years, students can apply for off-campus housing, of which only 250 are granted the privilege through a lottery.
Students involved in Greek life have the options of living in their organization's house, though they cannot do so until their junior year.</p>
<p>Colgate has three dining facilities on campus that are run by Colgate Dining Services, which in turn is run by <a>Sodexho</a>.
There is also a cafe located in Case Library that serves Starbucks coffee.</p>
<p>The O'Connor Campus Center, commonly referred to as the Coop, serves as the center for student life and programming.
Renovations on it were completed in 2004, and it now houses the offices for student organizations, a cafeteria, post office, printing center, a computer facility, as well as the new Blackmore Media Center, home to <a>WRCU</a>, Colgate's radio station.</p>
<h3>Greek and social life</h3>
<p>About forty-five percent of sophomores, juniors and seniors belong to the Greek system at Colgate.
Students are not allowed to pledge until the fall semester of their sophomore year.</p>
<p>Following a number of incidents related to Greek organizations on campus, in 2005, the university decided to purchase the Greek houses.
All but one of the Greek organizations sold their houses.
The hold-out, Delta Kappa Epsilon, was subsequently derecognized.
Students were forbidden from living in the house or participating in the fraternity's activities.
The groups cover a wide array of interests, including academic organizations, personal interests, student government, honor societies, and cultural and religious organizations.
Among its more notable groups are <em>The Colgate Maroon-News</em>, the oldest college weekly in America, the radio station <a>WRCU-FM</a>, the <a>a cappella</a> groups The Colgate Resolutions, The Colgate Thirteen, The Dischords, and The Swinging 'Gates, and the improv group Charred Goosebeak, the latter of which was founded by the members of <a>Broken Lizard</a>.</p>
<h2>Traditions and legacies</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The legendary &quot;Willow Path&quot;</a> The number 13 is considered to be lucky to Colgate.
The number shows up in student organizations such as Konosioni, the senior honor society, which is composed of thirteen men and thirteen women.
Alumni are asked to wear Colgate apparel on every Friday the 13th.</p>
<p><a>Ellis Island</a> National Monument displays an <a>anti-immigration</a> statement by <a>George Barton Cutten</a>, Colgate's eighth President, warning that &quot;The danger the '<a>melting pot</a>' brings to the nation is the breeding out of the higher divisions of the white race....&quot;  The topic of how to come to grips with the legacy of a former university president who espoused such views, but also presided over a long period of expansion for the University, has been a topic of debate at Colgate in recent years.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right|Colgate's athletic logo</a> Approximately 25% of students are involved in a varsity sport, and 80% of students are involved in some form of varsity, club, or intramural athletics.
There are 25 varsity teams, over 40 club sports teams, and 18 different intramural sports.
Colgate is part of <a>NCAA</a> Division I for all varsity sports.
</p>
<p>The <a>football</a> program competes within the Division I <a>Football Championship Subdivision</a> (FCS).
The athletic teams are nicknamed the &quot;Raiders,&quot; and the traditional team colors are maroon and white, with a more recent addition of gray in the 1970s.
Colgate is a member of the <a>Patriot League</a> for all varsity sports except for <a>hockey</a>, in which both its men's and women's teams are members of <a>ECAC Hockey</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in 1932, Colgate athletics teams were called the &quot;Red Raiders&quot; in reference to the new maroon uniforms of that season's <a>&quot;undefeated, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited&quot; football team</a>, which was the first to use the moniker.
Apocryphal explanations for the name include the team's ability to defeat its much larger rival, the <a>Cornell University</a> <a>Big Red</a>, or that a rainstorm caused one Colgate football team's maroon jerseys to blend into a reddish color.
In 2001, the administration acknowledged concerns that the adjective &quot;Red&quot; still had an American Indian implication, and the school shortened the nickname to the &quot;Raiders&quot; starting in the 2001-02 school year.
Some local TV outlets still use the logo with &quot;Red Raiders&quot; on it.
A new mascot was introduced in 2006.</p>
<p>Colgate University's football was given a Division I first place ranking by <a>Parke H. Davis</a> in 1916 and 1932, and appeared in the <a>Associated Press</a> Division I polls in 1942 and 1977.
The <a>1932 team</a> was &quot;unbeaten, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited&quot;, as it registered shutouts against all nine opponents, but was not invited to the 1933 Rose Bowl.
Colgate began playing in NCAA Division I-AA, now known as Division I FCS, in 1982, and made the Division I-AA (now FCS) football playoffs in 1982, 1983, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2008.</p>
<p>In the 2003 season, the Raiders made it to the NCAA I-AA championship game in football for the first time, where they lost to the <a>University of Delaware</a>.
At the end of the season, their record was 15-1.
At the time, they had the longest winning streak in all of Division I football, including one win over a <a>Division I-A</a> (now Division I FBS) team, <a>Buffalo</a>.</p>
<p>Cornell is a common rival in all sports; hockey games against Cornell are major events on campus, with students lining up for hours before the game in order to secure tickets.
Colgate's teams (with the exception of football, golf, and men's hockey) also compete annually against <a>Syracuse University</a>.
Cornell and Syracuse are both within two hours of Colgate's campus.
Colgate and Syracuse were once bitter rivals in football (there are some old traditions related to their games), but a variety of factors, including the splitting of Division I football into Division I FBS and Division I FCS in the late 1970s, helped end the annual game, with some exceptions (such as 2010) over the years.
Their men's lacrosse rivalry remains fierce.

<h3>Outdoor education</h3>
<p>Colgate makes use of its rural location by having a full outdoor education program.
A Base Camp is located on campus and allows students to rent equipment for skiing, camping, and other outdoor events.
Each year, twelve to fifteen students are selected to become staffers for Outdoor Education.
The training takes more than six months and includes a <a>Wilderness First Responder</a> certification.
Incoming first-year students are offered a week-long trip called Wilderness Adventure, where they spend a week backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, caving or rock climbing in the <a>Adirondacks</a>.</p>
