<p></p>
<p><strong>California State University, Long Beach</strong> (also known as <strong>Cal State Long Beach</strong>, <strong>Long Beach State</strong>, <strong>CSULB</strong>, <strong>LBSU</strong>, or <strong>The Beach</strong>) is the second largest <a>campus</a> of the <a>California State University</a> (CSU) system and the third largest <a>university</a> in the state of <a>California</a> by enrollment.
The University is located at the southeastern coastal tip of <a>Los Angeles County</a>, less than one mile from the border with <a>Orange County</a>.</p>
<p>CSULB has been recognized repeatedly as one of &quot;America's Best Value Colleges&quot; by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em>.
More than 30 factors are considered to rate the colleges in four categories: academics, tuition GPA (the sticker price minus average amount students receive in gift aid scholarships and grants), financial aid (how well colleges meet students' financial need) and student borrowing.
The university attained its highest ranking in the 2007 edition: the No. 3 best value public college in the nation.
Every year that CSULB has been included in the <em><a>Review</a>'s</em> &quot;Best Value Colleges&quot; rankings, it was the only university in the <a>CSU</a> system to receive such recognition.</p>
<p>Long Beach State has also been ranked as one of the top five public Master's Degree-granting institutions in the <a>West</a> by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a><strong>s &quot;America's Best Colleges Guide&quot; in every year's edition from 2005 to 2011.</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition, Long Beach State is one of the <a>West Coast's</a> top universities in student body racial diversity, named the 5th most diverse university in the West by U.S. News &amp; World Report.
It is also home to the largest publicly funded art school west of the <a>Mississippi</a>.
The university currently operates with one of the lowest student fees in the country at <a>US $</a>4,370 per year for full time students having California residence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|The original location of Los Angeles-Orange County State College.</a></p>
<p>The College was established in 1949 by California Governor <a>Earl Warren</a>, to serve the rapidly expanding post-<a>World War II</a> population of <a>Orange</a> and Southern <a>Los Angeles</a> counties.
Since then, CSULB has grown to become one of the state's largest and most well-respected universities.</p>
<p>The institution was first known as <em>Los Angeles-Orange County State College</em>.
It offered 25 courses, taught by 13 faculty members, in two apartment buildings at 5381 Anaheim Road in <a>Long Beach</a>.
In June 1950, the citizens of Long Beach voted overwhelmingly to purchase  as a permanent campus for the college, then known as <em>Long Beach State College</em>.
The purchase price was nearly $1,000,000.
Student enrollment grew rapidly in this new, permanent location.</p>
<p>By 1960, the student body exceeded 10,000 students, and by 1966, 20,000.
In 1964, LBSC changed its name to <em>California State College at Long Beach</em> to conform to the state system and enhance its prestige (it was renamed <em>California State College, Long Beach</em> in 1968).</p>
<p>In 1965, CSCLB hosted the first <a>International Sculpture Symposium</a> to be held in the <a>United States</a> and the first such symposium to be held at a college or university.
Six sculptors from abroad and two from the United States created many of the monumental sculptures present on the campus.
The event received national media attention from newspapers around the country, including the <em><a>New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>Los Angeles Times</a> Magazine</em>, <em><a>Art in America</a></em> and a six-page color spread in <em><a>Fortune Magazine</a></em>.</p>
<p>The school acquired <a>university</a> status in 1972, along with 12 other state college campuses.
The promotion was decided by the Board of Trustees of the <a>California State University</a> system, according to total enrollment, size of graduate programs, complexity and diversity of majors and number of doctorates held by faculty at each college.
CSCLB thus became <em>CSULB</em>.</p>
<p>Also in 1972, the campus became the home of the largest library facility in the then 19-campus <a>CSU</a> system: a modern six-story building with a <a>seating capacity</a> of nearly 4,000 students.</p>
<p>In 1995, President <a>Robert Maxson</a> initiated the privately-funded President's Scholars Program, providing selected qualified California high school <a>valedictorian</a>s and <a>National Merit</a> finalists and semi-finalists with a full four-year scholarship package, including tuition, a book stipend, and housing.
, over 1000 students have accepted the scholarship.
For applicants for Fall 2010, National Achievement Program Semifinalists/Finalists and National Hispanic Recognition scholars were also considered.</p>
<p>, CSULB had 37,890 students in attendance, making it the most populous campus of the CSU system.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus spans 323 <a>acre</a>s (1.3&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) across 84 buildings, and is located  from the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>.
It has its own U.S. Postal <a>Zip code</a>: 90840.
CSULB is located at 1250 Bellflower Boulevard.
It is bounded by East 7th Street to the south, East Atherton Street to the north, Bellflower Boulevard to the west, and Palo Verde Avenue to the east.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The architecture of the campus is mostly of the <a>International style</a> (designed primarily by noted architect <a>Edward Killingsworth</a>) and is very minimalist, placing emphasis instead on the landscaping that surrounds it.
This naturalistic, park-like layout has earned the campus numerous design awards, as well as other awards from gardening societies.
Recent construction maintains the characteristic glass-and-brick style.
The integration of landscaping and architecture is apparent at the school's theater complex, where a dense grove of <a>ficus</a> trees is planted in such a way that it forms a continuation of the pillar-supported canopy at the theater's entrance.
The University's registration offices are located in the open courtyard of Brotman Hall, which is &quot;roofed&quot; by a similar jungle-like canopy.
The Psychology building is also notable for its soaring, airy courtyard planted with tall <a>Eucalyptus</a> trees.</p>
<h3>Campus landmarks</h3>
<p>[[Image:Walter Pyramid.jpg|right|thumb|275px|The
[[Walter Pyramid]], the University's most prominent sporting complex and most recognizable landmark.]]</p>
<p>The <strong>University Student Union</strong> (USU) building is located at the center of campus.
The three-story glass building occupies roughly , housing numerous offices, and offering more casual attractions, including a study lounge, a ballroom, a food court, a bowling alley, an arcade, and a movie theater.</p>
<p>49er basketball and volleyball games are currently played in the iconic, eighteen-story <strong><a>Walter Pyramid</a></strong> (formerly known as the Long Beach Pyramid) located on north campus.
The Pyramid is a state-of-the-art sporting complex that can accommodate over 5,000 fans, including temporary seating and standing room.
Two sections of interior stands are fitted with large <a>hydraulic</a> lifts which can lift the seating elements forty-five degrees into the air, creating room for five volleyball courts or three basketball courts.
The Pyramid is home to the <a>Southern California Summer Pro League</a>, a noted showcase for current and prospective NBA basketball players.</p>
<p>The <strong>University Art Museum</strong> (UAM) ranks in the top 10% of the nation's over 6,000 museums.
Its permanent collection contains primarily abstract expressionist paintings, works on paper, and an outdoor sculpture garden that began in 1966.
The UAM was the first accredited museum in the <a>CSU system</a>.
In addition, the museum's Gordon F. Hampton collection is housed at the <a>Downtown Los Angeles</a> law offices of <a>Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton</a>.</p>
<p>The campus is also home to the <strong><a>Carpenter Performing Arts Center</a></strong>, a 1,074-seat theater named after CSULB alumni <a>Richard and Karen Carpenter</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong><a>Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden</a></strong> is an artistic retreat of solitude and beauty.
Among its many picturesque attractions, The Garden features a large pond populated with <a>koi</a>.</p>
<p>One of the newest areas that has become integral to student life in the Parkside dormitories is The Circle.
The Circle was formed as part of the central landscaping of the Parkside Commons outdoor common area when a group of students moved the 4 'S' shaped stone benches residing there into a circle formation in the Fall of 2008.
Since then, The Circle (also known as the Late Night Circle, due to its high concentration of nighttime denizens) has become the defining marker of the Parkside experience, and it continues to provide a fun hangout for the residents of Parkside Commons.
</p>
<h3>Puvunga</h3>
<p>The campus is believed to be the location of an ancient <a>Tongva</a> village and burial site known as <a>Puvunga</a>, and is listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
CSULB has challenged this designation, claiming they were not consulted when the application was filed.
From 1992 to 1995, when the university attempted to build a <a>strip mall</a> and student housing on the last undeveloped portion of the campus, the Tongva people filed a lawsuit and initiated a protest, which involved physically occupying the land day and night to stave off <a>bulldozer</a>s.</p>
<h3>Future development</h3>
<p>In the Spring of 2007, the student body voted to approve the construction of a student recreation and wellness center on campus.
Slated for completion by Fall 2010, the Rec and Wellness Center was planned to be an extensive all-purpose athletic center covering about  on North Campus.
Plans included facilities for fitness programs and aerobics classes, courts for volleyball, basketball and badminton, rock climbing walls, an indoor track, a student lounge, and much more.
This program is funded and managed by CSULB's Associated Students, Incorporated.
This project has been completed and had its first openinig the week before the fall semester of 2010.

<h3>Campus sustainability</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px</a> <a>right|thumb|200px</a></p>
<p>The University, in its push to support climate sustainability, installed solar panels on the Brotman Hall building and the Facilities Management canopy parking in 2007.
The University has been taking steps in addressing the challenge of sustainability, with the support of its student government, student body, and organizations, such as the Environmental Science &amp; Policy Club.</p>
<p>The Environmental Science &amp; Policy Club (ES&amp;P Club) has brought support to environmental awareness and sustainability through club activities, such as coastal clean-ups, hikes, plant-restoration project, tabling, conferences, guest speakers, &amp; Kaleidoscope.
In 2006, the ES&amp;P Club supported the installation of waterless urinals in the University's men's restrooms.
The ES&amp;P Club hosts an annual Earth Week celebration each April, including documentary screenings, discussions, and speaker series.
</p>
<p>The University &quot;has a comprehensive energy management program incorporating real-time metering and energy-saving technologies such as the EnergySaver, which provides a more sophisticated alternative to turning off the lights by automatically varying the voltage to the ballasted fixtures and reducing the power consumed, while maintaining appropriate lighting levels.&quot;
</p>
<h3>Public transportation</h3>
<p>The campus is currently serviced by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Long Beach Transit</a> (routes 81, 91, 92, 93, 94, 171, 173, 96 ZAP, and Passport D)</li>
  <li><a>OCTA</a> (routes 1, 50, and 60)</li>
  <li><a>LACMTA</a> <a>Express</a> (route 577X, <a>LACMTA Blue Line</a> also provides service to the Long Beach area, accessible by bus routes)</li>
</ul>
<p>In September 2008, President F. King Alexander announced the school's new &quot;U-PASS&quot; program in conjunction with Long Beach Transit.
Under the new partnership, students with a valid CSULB I.D. card ride any Long Beach Transit bus for free year-round.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|E. James Brotman Hall, the University's administrative headquarters on campus.</a></p>

<h3>Academic department reputations</h3>
<p>CSU Long Beach's College of the Arts has more art and <a>design</a> majors than any other public university in America.
CSU Long Beach also produces the most master of science in <a>nursing</a> (MSN) graduates in the 23-campus CSU system.</p>
<p><em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> has repeatedly ranked CSULB engineering program as one of the Top 50 undergraduate programs in the nation, and even commended the University's programs for first-year students as &quot;stellar examples of academic programs that lead to student success.&quot;
In 2008, CSULB's engineering program received its highest ever ranking at number 38, tied with <a>Cal State Northridge</a>, also part of the CSU system.
Long Beach is one of only six CSU programs in the top-ranked tier of engineering programs accredited by the <a>Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a> (ABET).</p>
<p>In March 2008, the music department was renamed the <a>Bob Cole Conservatory of Music</a> in honor of an endowment gift of $16.4 million from his estate.
Cole, a Long Beach real estate investor, long-time music lover, and amateur pianist, died in 2004.
The gift benefits the students of the conservatory in the form of scholarships and other awards.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt;<strong>Fall Admission Statistics</strong>&lt;/big&gt;</p>
<p>The average high school <a>GPA</a> of incoming freshmen for Fall 2008 was 3.37, and the average <a>SAT</a> score was 1026/1600 (the writing section is not considered).</p>
<p>The CSU system has reported a record number of total applications for the Fall 2010 semester, with more than 609,000.
CSULB received over 71,000 of those applications, the most of any campus in the system and another school record.
CSULB also drew the greatest number of first-time freshman applicants (47,683) and transfer student applicants (21,973) of any CSU campus.
Due to the ongoing state-wide budget deficit, the increasingly-limited number of seats available means that only an estimated 5,500 (7.7%) will enroll for that semester, much less than in recent school history.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p></p>
<p>CSULB hosts over 350 events annually, welcoming more than 150,000 patrons to its performance halls, conference centers, and exhibit venues.</p>
