<p><strong>Wittenberg University</strong> is a private four-year <a>liberal arts college</a> affiliated with the <a>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> located in <a>Springfield, Ohio</a>, <a>United States</a>.
The college serves 1,900 full-time students representing 37 states and approximately 29 foreign countries.
Wittenberg is nationally distinguished by its strong interdisciplinary programs in East Asian and Russian Area Studies</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Main entrance to the University</a> Wittenberg was founded in 1845 by a group of pastors in the <a>English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio</a>.
Reverend <a>Ezra Keller</a> was the principal founder and first president of the college.
Its initial focus was to train clergy.
One of its main missions was to &quot;Americanize&quot; Lutherans by teaching courses in English instead of German, unlike <a>Capital University</a> in <a>Columbus, Ohio</a>.
The first class originally consisted of eight students at the beginning of the academic year, but grew to seventy-one by the end.
With a faculty of one professor and two tutors, classes were held in Springfield, Ohio in a church on land that was donated.
This area was selected due to being located on the <a>National Road</a>, which made Springfield an agricultural and industrial center.
In 1874, women were admitted, and, the following year, blacks were also admitted.
The name came from Wittenberg University, located in <a>Wittenberg</a>, <a>Germany</a>, the town where <a>Martin Luther</a> posted his <a>95 theses</a>.

<h3>Hamma Divinity School</h3>
<p>In 1978, Wittenberg&#x2019;s Theological Seminary, successively known as Hamma Divinity School and Hamma School of Theology, merged with the Joint Synod controlled Evangelical Lutheran Seminary of <a>Capital University</a> in <a>Bexley, Ohio</a>.
This represented a one hundred and eighty degree reversal from the original founders&#x2019; desire to separate from the German synod and to emphasize use of the English language in teaching.
The reunited schools became Trinity Lutheran Seminary as it is known today.
It is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
It became independent, administratively but not geographically, from Capital University in 1959.
The seminary cooperates with the Methodist Seminary in Delaware, Ohio, and the Pontifical Josephinum in Columbus by sharing faculty and student courses.
</p>
<p>Rev.
<a>Luther Alexander Gotwald</a>, D.D. (1833&#x2013;1900), Professor of Theology in the Hamma Divinity School was famously tried for and unanimously acquitted of heresy by the Board of Directors at Wittenberg on April 4 and April 5, 1893, which put on trial many key issues that Lutherans still debate today.
Wittenberg attained a national perspective and found a place in the mainstream of American higher education.</p>
<h3>School for Community Education</h3>
<p>The school is a connection to Wittenberg for adults and other non-traditional students engaging in both credited and non-credited learning activities.
Although Wittenberg began to offer evening courses for adults in the 1920s, it was not until 1951 that the institution established a formal administrative entity, SCE (not formally a School until 1957), to meet the specific needs of adults and other non-traditional students.
Since that time, Wittenberg has undergone an evolution from an institution of local and regional character to that of a selective liberal arts institution attracting students from over 40 states plus overseas.
Not surprisingly, during these years of evolution, questions arose concerning the type of commitment to community and continuing education activities appropriate to such an institution.
A result has been the approval in 1986 of a formal Mission Statement for SCE, the first in its history.
The School for Community Education has programs in Professional Studies for Adults: credit studies, including the Evening/Weekend program and the facilitation of adult enrollment in Day courses.
The Center for Musical Development (CMD), Non-Credit activities for adults and children, including summer residential academic programs and conferences, Summer Session (the schedule of Summer credit courses for the entire University) and High School Scholars&#x2014;Wittenberg&#x2019;s program for Ohio Post-Secondary Enrollment Options students.</p>
<p>The School of Community Education is also in charge of the internship program students do during the summer for credits.
Students have done internships for credit in many different career fields including broadcast journalism, business, art, political science, biology, pre-med, east Asian studies, etc.
The School of Community Education is also in charage of the summer abroad programs for example programs Wittenberg run programs in China, Japan, Europe and Chile</p>
