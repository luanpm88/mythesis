<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>[[Image:Arnold Guyot03.jpg|thumb|Australia
map compiled by [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] and Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]] Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard was born in <a>Sheffield, Massachusetts</a>, on May 5, 1809.
In 1828 he graduated, second on the honour list, at <a>Yale University</a>.
He was then in turn a tutor at Yale, and as he began to lose his hearing due to a hereditary condition he became a teacher (1831&#x2014;1832) in the <a>American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb</a> at <a>Hartford, Connecticut</a>, and a teacher (1832&#x2014;1838) in the <a>New York Institute for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb</a>.
</p>
<p>From 1838 to 1848 he was professor of <a>mathematics</a> and <a>natural philosophy</a>, and from 1848 to 1854 was professor of <a>chemistry</a> and <a>natural history</a> in the <a>University of Alabama</a>, for two years, also, filling the chair of <a>English literature</a>.
In 1854 he was ordained as <a>deacon</a> in the <a>Protestant Episcopal Church</a>.
In the same year he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in the <a>University of Mississippi</a>, of which institution he was chancellor from 1856 until the outbreak of the <a>Civil War</a>, when, his sympathies being with the North, he resigned and went to <a>Washington</a>.</p>
<p>In 1860, he was one of the party sent to <a>Labrador</a> to observe an eclipse of the sun; in 1862 he was at work on the reduction of <a>Gilliss</a>'s observations of the stars of the southern hemisphere, and in 1863 he superintended the publication of maps and charts of the <a>United States Coast Survey</a>.
He was president of the <a>American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> in 1866; a member of the board of experts of the American Bureau of Mines in 1865, and a member of the <a>American Institute</a> in 1872.</p>
<p>In 1864 he became the tenth president of <a>Columbia College</a> (now <a>Columbia University</a>) in <a>New York City</a>, which position he held until the year before his death, his service thus being longer than that of any of his predecessors.
During this period the growth of the college was rapid; new departments were established; the elective system was greatly extended; more adequate provision was made for graduate study and original research, and the enrollment was increased from about 150 to more than 1000 students.
Barnard strove to have educational privileges extended by the university to women as well as to men, and <a>Barnard College</a>, for women, established immediately after his death, was named in his honour.
</p>
<p>Barnard was a <a>classical</a> and English <a>scholar</a>, a <a>mathematician</a>, a <a>physicist</a>, a <a>chemist</a>, and a good public speaker.
His annual reports to the <a>Board of Trustees of Columbia</a> included valuable discussions of educational problems.</p>
<p>Barnard and <a>Arnold Henry Guyot</a> were Editors-in-Chief of the 1876 <em>Johnson&#x2019;s New Universal Cyclopaedia</em>.
</p>
<p>Barnard wrote <em>Treatise on Arithmetic</em> (1830); an <em>Analytical Grammar with Symbolic Illustration</em> (1836); <em>Letters on Collegiate Government</em> (1855); <em>History of the United States Coast Survey</em> (1857); <em>Recent Progress in Science</em> (1869); and <em>The Metric System</em> (1871).</p>
<p>He died in <a>New York City</a> on the 27th of April 1889.
He left the bulk of his property to Columbia College.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>His brother, <a>John G. Barnard</a> was a career engineering officer in the <a>U.S. Army</a>, serving as the Superintendent of the <a>United States Military Academy</a> and then as a general in the Union Army during the <a>American Civil War</a>.</p>
