<p>The 2008-2009 cross country season was a historic one.
The Fanshawe women's cross country team won Fanshawe&#x2019;s third national title in the school&#x2019;s 41 year history; the first time in 27 years since the men&#x2019;s basketball team last accomplished the feat in the 1981 season.
In addition to the men's 4th consecutive national medal, the result puts the Fanshawe Cross Country program on top of college running in Canada for the 08-09 season.
