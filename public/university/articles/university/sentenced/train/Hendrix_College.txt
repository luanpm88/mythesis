<h2>College history</h2>
<p>Hendrix College was founded as a primary school called Central Institute in 1876 at <a>Altus, Arkansas</a>, by Rev. Isham L. Burrow.
In 1881 it was renamed Central Collegiate Institute when secondary and collegiate departments were added.
By 1886, three conferences of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a> purchased the school.
This began the school's relationship with the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a> and later <a>The Methodist Church</a>, and <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
The Central Collegiate Institute was renamed Hendrix College in 1889 after Rev. <a>Eugene Russell Hendrix</a>, a presiding bishop over three Arkansas Methodist conferences.
This same year, the primary school was discontinued.
Afterwards, Hendrix College might have been the only male Methodist college in Arkansas.
It was founded as a male only institution.
Eventually, females were permitted to enroll, but separation of the sexes was tightly controlled.
In 1890 after receiving bids from seven other Arkansas towns, Conway was chosen as the new location for the college by the Hendrix Board of Trustees.
A publication by the U.S. Office of Education in 1900 stated that Hendrix College had the highest standards for admission and graduation of any Arkansas institution of higher learning, public or private.
By 1925 the secondary department was discontinued.
A bid was accepted in 1929 to merge the college with Henderson-Brown College, a private college in <a>Arkadelphia, Arkansas</a>.
The merger created Hendrix-Henderson College.
The newly formed college was planning to move the school to <a>Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, but the city of Conway was able to raise $150,000 to keep the school located at Hendrix's campus.
Two years later the name of the college was reverted back to Hendrix College after a short period of being named Trinity College, which met with strong opposition from many students and alumni.
The college then merged again with Galloway Women&#x2019;s College in <a>Searcy, Arkansas</a> in 1933.
Hendrix College retained its location and facilities during this merger as well.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The main entrance of Hendrix College</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no <a>fraternities</a> or <a>sororities</a>.
</li>
  <li>65 student organizations offer a wide range of student activities, funded by a student activity fee allocated by the Hendrix Student Senate.
Social Committee, or SoCo, is the largest student organization with a budget of $100,000 brings entertainers and events to campus.
SoCo members are peer-elected each year and represent each hall and class.
</li>
  <li>The Office of Student Activities plans weekend and Wednesday evening events.
Major social events are frequently held in &quot;The Brick Pit&quot; (formerly the &quot;Brick Patio&quot;), an outdoor area in the center of the campus (Most famous among them is &quot;Shirttails,&quot; the freshman dance-off of Youtube fame).
Additionally, the campus is located approximately 30 miles from Little Rock, which offers additional night life options.
This is important for many students because Faulkner County is a <a>dry county</a>.
</li>
  <li>The Student Senate is the governing body of the student association.
Along with campus-wide elected officers, students elect representatives from each class and residence hall.</li>
<li>The Student Congress team has largely dominated the Arkansas Student Congress, particularly over the past few years, with championships in 2004, 2007, and 2009.
Senior Brad Howard was elected President of the Senate for the 2005 team, and the 2007 team was especially notable for Jacob Kauffman, who, as a freshman, received the Best Overall Delegate Award.
The team is sponsored and coached by Mary Richardson and has been captained by Brad Howard, Stephanie Bright, Samuel Kauffman, and Caelan O'Sullivan.
Members of the team enjoy leisurely hikes, kittens, unwarranted self-importance, and writing themselves into Wikipedia Articles.</li>
