By 1920 it had become a center for progressive thought.
Today, many national and international rankings frequently place Peking University as one of the best universities in China.
In addition to its academics, Peking University is especially renowned for the beauty of its traditional Chinese architecture at its campus grounds.
</p>
<p>Throughout its history, the university has distinguished itself in terms of intellectual freedom and has produced and hosted many modern and prominent Chinese thinkers, including figures such as: <a>Lu Xun</a>, <a>Mao Zedong</a>, <a>Gu Hongming</a>, <a>Hu Shih</a>, <a>Li Dazhao</a>, and <a>Chen Duxiu</a>.
Peking University was influential in the birth of China's <a>New Culture Movement</a>, <a>May Fourth Movement</a>, the <a>Tiananmen Square protest of 1989</a> and many other significant events.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Peking University was established in Beijing in December 1898 during the <a>Hundred Days Reform</a> and was originally known as the Imperial Capital University () to replace the ancient <a>Guozijian</a> (&#x570b;&#x5b50;&#x76e3; gu&#x00f3;z&#x01d0;ji&#x00e0;n).
In 1902, the Imperial Capital University's Faculty of Education was spun off to become today's <a>Beijing Normal University</a>, the best teacher's college in China.
In 1912, following the Xinhai Revolution, the Imperial University was renamed &quot;National Peking University&quot; ().
The famous scholar <a>Cai Yuanpei</a> was appointed president on January 4, 1917, and helped transform the university into the country's largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students.
Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included <a>Hu Shi</a>, <a>Chen Duxiu</a>, and <a>Lu Xun</a>.
In 1919, students of Peking University formed the bulk of the protesters of the <a>May Fourth Movement</a>.
Efforts by the Beiyang government to end the protests by sealing off the Peking University campus led to Cai's resignation.
In 1920, Peking University became the second Chinese university to accept female students, after <a>Nanjing University</a>.

In 1938, the three schools moved again, this time to <a>Kunming</a>, and formed the <a>National Southwestern Associated University</a>.
In 1946, after World War II, Peking University moved back to Beijing.
At that time, the university comprised six schools (Arts, Science, Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture), and a research institute for humanities.
The total student enrollment grew up to 3,000.</p>
<p>In 1952, three years after the People's Republic of China was established, <a>Yenching University</a> was merged into Peking University and Peking University lost its &quot;national&quot; appellation to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public.
In 1952 Peking University moved from downtown Beijing to the former Yenching campus.
The first disturbances of the Cultural Revolution began at Peking University in 1966; education there ceased between 1966 and 1970.
</p>
<p>In 2000, <a>Beijing Medical University</a> was merged into Peking University and became the Peking University Health Science Campus.
Beida now has eight affiliated hospitals and 12 teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>In 2001, Peking University set up a satellite campus in Shenzhen.
The university's second business school was launched on this campus in 2004, and was renamed Beida <a>HSBC School of Business</a> in 2008.</p>
