<p>The <strong>University of Colorado at Boulder</strong> (<strong>CU-Boulder</strong>; <strong>CU</strong>) is a public research university located in <a>Boulder, Colorado</a>.
Considered a <a>Public Ivy</a>, it is the <a>flagship university</a> of the <a>University of Colorado system</a> and was founded five months before Colorado was admitted to the union in 1876.
The university's colors are officially silver and gold; however, traditional CU items utilize the black and gold color scheme.</p>
<p>In 2007, the university consisted of nine colleges and schools and offered over 150 academic programs, enrolled 28,988 students, and granted 6,781 degrees.
Six <a>Nobel Laureate</a>s, seven <a>MacArthur Fellow</a>s, and 17 <a>astronauts</a> have been affiliated with CU Boulder as students, researchers, or faculty members in its history.
The university received nearly $847 million in sponsored research in 2009 to fund programs like the <a>Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics</a>, <a>JILA</a>, and <a>National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>'s <a>NIST-F1</a> <a>atomic clock</a>.</p>
<p><a>Colorado Buffaloes</a> competed in nine intercollegiate sports in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> <a>Big 12 Conference</a>.
On June 10, 2010, it was announced that they would be joining the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.
The Buffaloes have won 23 NCAA championships: 17 in <a>skiing</a>, five total in <a>men's</a> and <a>women's cross country</a>, and one in <a>football</a>.
Approximately 1,500 students participate in 34 intercollegiate club sports annually as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|350px|The CU Boulder campus.</a>
On March 14, 1876, the Colorado state legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution that provided money for the establishment of the University of Colorado in Boulder, the <a>Colorado School of Mines</a> in <a>Golden</a>, and Colorado Agricultural College in <a>Fort Collins</a>, now known as <a>Colorado State University</a>.</p>
<p>Two cities competed for the site University of Colorado: Boulder and <a>Ca&#x00f1;on City</a>.
The consolation prize for the losing city was to be home of the new Colorado State Prison.
Ca&#x00f1;on City was at a disadvantage as it was already the home of the Colorado Territorial Prison.
(There are now six prisons in the Ca&#x00f1;on City area).</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875.
The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877.
At the time, there were few <a>high school</a>s in the state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the University, a preparatory school was formed on campus.
In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school.
There were 38 men and 27 women, and their ages ranged from 12&#x2013;23 years.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The main CU-Boulder Campus is located about  south of the popular <a>Pearl Street Mall</a>.
It is composed of academic and residential buildings as well as research facilities.
The East Campus is about a quarter mile from the main campus and is composed mainly of athletic fields and research buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hill&quot; borders Campus to the West and is a central location for shops, restaurants, bars, etc.
The Hill is also prime real estate for students, given its central location and proximity to campus.
The majority of Greek fraternities and sororities are located on the Hill.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Main</a> In 1917, the university was undergoing a massive expansion.
This triggered debate over the architectural style of the campus.
The consensus was that the University should be built in a unified style, but which style was the center of the debate.
Some wanted to follow the style of Macky Auditorium, which was <a>Neo-Gothic</a>, while others wanted to use the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style of many East Coast schools.
However, <a>Charles Klauder</a>, the chosen architect, presented then President Norlin with sketches of new buildings in Italian Rural Architecture.
This style was developed in the mountains of northern <a>Italy</a>, and Klauder and Norlin felt that it was a harmonious fit with the Boulder foothills.</p>
<p>The most obvious characteristics of this style on the Boulder campus are the rough, textured walls and the sloping, multi-leveled roofs with red tile.
The sandstone used in the construction of nearly all the buildings on campus was selected from a quarry in <a>Lyons, Colorado</a>.
The architecture had a rugged yet classical feel, fitting for a western University.
Klauder&#x2019;s vision for the campus took nearly twenty years to complete, and laid the foundation for the future design of the campus.</p>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p>The College of Engineering and Applied Science at CU was founded in 1893 and is one of the top-ranked undergraduate and graduate engineering programs in the country.
The Engineering Center consists of  of classrooms, computing facilities, offices, and laboratories.
This architecturally distinctive and modern center is home to the nation's largest geotechnical centrifuge, ion-implantation and microwave-propagation facilities, low-turbulence wind tunnels, spectrometers, electron and other microscopes, and a structural analysis facility.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Norlin Library</a> Until 1903, the library collection was housed with the rest of the school in Old Main.
The growing size of the library required a move, as the weight of the books was causing physical damage to the floor.
The cornerstone for the first separate library building was laid in January 1903, and the building was opened in January 1904.
When the new Norlin Library opened in 1940, the old library turned over to the Theatre department, and was converted into classrooms and a theatre.
<a>thumb|left|Norlin Library main entrance</a> Norlin Library was the last building to be designed by Klauder.
There are two inscriptions on the western face of the building, overlooking the Norlin Quadrangle.
Both were composed by President Norlin.
The larger inscription reads &#x201c;Who knows only his own generation remains always a child,&#x201d; based on a Cicero quotation, while the smaller inscription on the marble just over the door reads &#x201c;Enter here the timeless fellowship of the human spirit.&#x201d;</p>
<h3>Macky Auditorium</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Macky Auditorium</a> Macky Auditorium is a large building on the University of Colorado campus, which plays host to various talks, plays, and musical performances.
Andrew J. Macky was a prominent businessman involved with the town of Boulder in the late 19th century.
Macky served as the President, as well as a stockholder of the First National Bank, an institution founded by another early CU supporter Lewis Cheney.
Macky is credited with a number of landmarks throughout Boulder, where he was a carpenter and involved in politics.</p>
<p>The Auditorium opened its doors in 1923, thirteen years after construction started.
Macky's adopted daughter, May, sued for a third of Macky's estate, a case that took thirteen years to settle.
May was angered that her father left her no money in his will, while leaving $400,000 to CU for the hall&#x2019;s construction.
The university eventually won the case, and the majority of critical construction on the building resumed.</p>
<p>The building has a variety of architectural elements from various buildings around the globe that President Baker, CU&#x2019;s president at the turn of the 20th century, admired.
The design of the auditorium is primarily <a>Neo-Gothic</a>, with the primary materials being sandstone and red tile, like the rest of campus.
The result is a unique building, with two large towers and sprawling ivy, that sets itself apart from the rest of the CU campus.
Macky was refurbished in 1986, with improved seating, custom carpeting, modern plumbing and an elevator.
Currently there is an electronic bell system in the towers of Macky which rings the hours during the day.</p>
<p>Macky is the home of two departments both in the College of Music, the Jazz Studies Department and the Choral Department, and it houses an art gallery which is open Wednesdays, and to patrons during performances.
The hall houses almost all performances by the Boulder Philharmonic, the Artist Series, and the CU Opera.
Macky is also the home of many lectures including the Conference on World Affairs held at CU each spring.</p>
<h3>University Memorial Center (UMC)</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Dalton Trumbo Fountain Court behind the UMC on July 13, 2006</a> In 1947, <a>Colorado Governor</a> <a>Lee Knous</a> issued a <a>proclamation</a> to create a <a>memorial</a> to Colorado's servicemen at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
A proposal to house this memorial in a <a>student union</a> building resulted in a remarkable fundraising effort.
The University Memorial Center opened its doors in October 1953 with President <a>Robert Stearns</a> presiding over the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Pundits of the day described the building as &quot;opulent&quot; and &quot;breathtaking,&quot; and the UMC quickly became the central landmark of the Boulder campus.
A 1964 addition created a new book store, conference facilities, additional dining facilities, and offices to house the rapidly growing student activities and organizations.
The expansion was financed through bonds granted by student fees.</p>
<p>The 1960s and '70s put the UMC at the center of student activism as students staged strikes, grape boycotts, love-ins, sit-ins, and walk-outs.
The UMC Fountain Court (now the Dalton Trumbo Fountain Court) became a familiar sight to network television news watchers as the famous and notorious promoted their cause at CU-Boulder.
Entertainers as diverse as <a>Ramsey Lewis</a> and the <a>Grateful Dead</a> have performed in the <a>Glenn Miller</a> Ballroom.
The UMC Connection, a student entertainment center in the basement, is a more informal gathering place, featuring pool tables and a small bowling alley.
It also features Club 156, which hosts concerts from local and up-and-coming bands.
In 1986, students passed another bond issue to remodel the food services area.
The <a>Alferd Packer</a> Grill was transformed to the current food court concept and students have since enjoyed the addition of other vendors including Subway, Dominos, and Celestial Seasonings Teas and Coffees.</p>
<h3>Recreation Center</h3>
<p>In 1973 the student recreation center was built on the CU-Boulder's main campus, by the architect James Wallace.
The funding to build the recreation center came entirely from student fees, which also funded the expansion in 1990.
It is currently  and operates on a $5 million annual budget.
The center is co-managed by the division of student affairs and CUSG, CU-Boulder's student government.
It is located on the northern edge of campus next to Folsom Stadium.
It is open 7 days a week and on average 16 hours a day with most of its facilities available for use during those hours.</p>
<h3>Mary Rippon Theatre</h3>
<p><a>250px|thumb|right|The view from the back of the Mary Rippon Theatre</a> The Mary Rippon Theatre is an outdoor <a>theater</a> and the site of many <a>cultural</a> events, notably the <a>Colorado Shakespeare Festival</a>.
The Theatre was named after Professor <a>Mary Rippon</a>, the first female instructor at the University and one of the first female University instructors in the United States.
She taught German and French.
Professor Rippon was so popular with students that when attempts were made to replace her with a male instructor, the student body revolted <em>en masse</em>, and Rippon kept her job.</p>
<h3>Galleries</h3>
<p>Norlin Library features two art galleries, several dedicated art spaces, and art works on display throughout the building.
The <a>CU Art Museum</a> features cutting edge works of modern and contemporary art, as well as historical art works.

<h3>Media</h3>
<p>The <em>Campus Press</em> was the University of Colorado's <a>student newspaper</a> before becoming the <em>CU Independent</em> in August 2008.
It began as a weekly printed newspaper and became an online daily in 2006.
The online edition features a <a>weblog</a> facility for students.</p>
<p>The <em>Campus Press</em> staff amounted to approximately 60 <a>editors</a>, <a>reporter</a>s and <a>photographers</a>, responsible for providing the online edition with new content at least once a day.
Most contributors were members of the University's School of Journalism and Mass Communication, but most other schools are represented too.
There were around 20 editors, including campus editors, responsible for editing stories' content; section editors, who constructed and assigned stories to their respective sections; and online editors, who update and maintain the website.
A managing editor and an editor-in-chief oversee the production of daily online editions.
Online editions include blogs, slide shows, commentary, news, sports.
and features.</p>
<p>The <em>Campus Press</em> was founded by Mal Deans.
At the time of its conception, the paper published a printed edition every week.
The paper was originally titled <em>The Working Press.</em>
Dave Sikardi was the first student editor.
The Campus Press was the first online newspaper in Colorado, beginning in April, 1994.</p>
<p>In August 2006, however, the <em>Campus Press</em> officially launched as an online-only newspaper, abolishing the print edition entirely.
The move was not without controversy, and the <em>Campus Press<strong>s tagline on the website was edited from &quot;CU's only independent student voice&quot; to &quot;CU's only student voice&quot;.
The Campus Press stated that they became independent of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication and changed its name to the </strong></em>CU Independent<em>.
However, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication continued to host the publication's office space, supply them with computers and other resources, and retain the editors and adviser on payroll.
The new website launched on January 12, 2009.</em></p>
<p><em>CU Independent</em>  is an affiliate of <a>UWIRE</a> , which distributes and promotes its content to their network.
The <em>CU Independent</em> is a daily online publication with a staff of about 100 writers and editors, that are representative of all schools on campus.</p>
<p>In spring of 2010, the <em>CU Independent</em> launched a revolutionary new program devoted to bringing awareness to issues of discrimination and celebrating instances of diversity on campus.
The <a>Speak Out!</a> campaign restructures the traditional beat system to include stories tagged as discussing heterosexism, classism, sexism, ableism, body image, ethnocentrism, racism and substance abuse; among other topics.</p>
<p>Starting in fall 2010, the opinion section of the publication has been hosting content written by guest contributors from organizations around campus.
These pieces are editorials about upcoming events and their significance in promoting diversity at CU.</p>
<p>The publication is a testing pad for many new instances of community news and multimedia.</p>
