<p></p>
<p>The <strong>State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry</strong> (<strong>SUNY ESF</strong>) is an American specialized doctoral-granting institution located in the <a>University Hill</a> neighborhood of <a>Syracuse, New York</a>, immediately adjacent to <a>Syracuse University</a>. ESF also operates several regional campuses across central New York, including the <a>New York State Ranger School</a> in <a>Wanakena, New York</a>. The College's curricula focus on the understanding and management of the environment and natural resources.</p>
<h2>Founding</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by <a>New York</a> Governor <a>John Alden Dix</a>. The previous year, Governor <a>Hughes</a> had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college. Both bills followed the state's defunding, in 1903, of the <a>New York State College of Forestry at Cornell</a>.  Originally a unit of <a>Syracuse University</a>, in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity. </p>
<p>[[Image:Hunter Mountain, Twilight.jpg|thumb|left|<em>Hunter Mountain, Twilight</em> (1866) by [[Hudson River school]] artist <a>Sanford Robinson Gifford</a>, showing the devastation wrought by years of tanbarking and logging.]]</p>
<p>Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer <a>Louis Marshall</a>, a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill <a>Forest Preserve (New York)</a>, became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor <a>James R. Day</a> his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University, and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix. Marshall was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board. </p>
<p>The first dean of the College was <a>William L. Bray</a>, a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago, botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of <a>Gifford Pinchot</a>, who was the first Chief of the <a>United States Forest Service</a>. In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.</p>
<p>In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published <em>The Development of the Vegetation of New York State</em>, he became one of the founding members, along with <a>Raphael Zon</a> and <a>Yale School of Forestry</a>'s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the <a>Ecological Society of America</a>. In 1950, the 1917 &quot;activist wing&quot; of that Society formed today's <a>The Nature Conservancy</a>.   </p>
<p>Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school's first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913. One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities. In 1912, the College opened its <a>Ranger School</a> in <a>Wanakena, New York</a>, in the <a>Adirondacks</a>. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees&mdash;one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper&mdash;graduated in the late 1940s.</p>
<p>In January 1930, Governor <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college's second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: &quot;under [Marshall's] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, <a>Franklin Moon</a>, the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States&quot;. The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate <a>Alfred E. Smith</a> who was elected to assume the presidency of the college's Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>With the formation of the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's &quot;primacy&quot; among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Main campus</h3>

<p>The Syracuse campus is ESF's main campus, and is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. It is made up of seven main buildings: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baker Laboratory</strong>: Named after <a>Hugh P. Baker</a>, Dean of the College from 1912&#x2013;1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several computer clusters and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Construction Management and Wood Products Engineering, and the Department of Environmental Resources and Forest Engineering.  The building recently underwent a $37 million overhaul; providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the <a>Nelson C. Brown</a> Center for Ultrastructure Studies. When the renovation is complete, Baker Lab will be the site of ESF's NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a &quot;smart&quot; classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios.  It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.</li>
  <li><strong>Bray Hall</strong>: The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after <a>William L. Bray</a>, a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first Dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices, and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management.</li>
  <li><strong>Illick Hall</strong>: The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after <a>Joseph S. Illick</a>, a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) in the basement. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building. All of the bathrooms in this buildings mysteriously smell horrid, despite being very clean.</li>
  <li><strong>Jahn Laboratory</strong>: Named after <a>Edwin C. Jahn</a>, a dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building is the newest on the campus, completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.</li>
  <li><strong>Marshall Hall</strong>: Named after <a>Louis Marshall</a>, one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni (Nifkin) Lounge, Gallery (snack bar), Campus Bookstore, and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus <a>Bob Marshall</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Moon Library</strong>: Dedicated to <a>F. Franklin Moon</a>, an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement.</li>
  <li><strong>Walters Hall</strong>: Named after <a>J. Henry Walters</a>, who served on the College's Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway Building</strong>: Currently under construction: &quot;The SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) broke ground Friday, Aug. 6, 2010, for construction of the new Gateway Building, a $28.3 million project that will showcase the college's commitment to sustainability through a sophisticated array of renewable energy technologies.&quot; The new building will be a showcase for green infrastructure and development. &quot;The Gateway Building's design and construction sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes,&quot; said ESF President Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr. The building is expected to be completed with LEED Platinum certification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. There are also a maintenance and operations building, garage, and greenhouse converted to office space. Several new buildings are planned, including new student dormitories, a campus &quot;Gateway&quot; building, and a research support building.</p>
<p>The historical Robin Hood Oak is located behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree to be listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The ESF mission statement is &quot;to advance knowledge and skills and to promote the leadership necessary for the stewardship of both the natural and designed environments.&quot; ESF is a &quot;specialized institution&quot; of the <a>State University of New York</a>, meaning that curricula focus primarily on one field, the College's being environmental management and stewardship. Students supplement their education with courses taken at Syracuse University. ESF is ranked at 34th, tied with Michigan State University, Alamaba and Miami-Ohio, and ahead of all other SUNY schools in the 2011 US News &amp; World Report rankings of the top public national universities.  Furthermore, ESF is ranked 79th in the 2011 US News &amp; World Report list of the best National Universities (both public and private), also ahead of all other SUNY schools.</p>
<p>ESF has academic departments in the fields of chemistry; construction management and wood products engineering; environmental and forest biology; environmental resources and forest engineering; environmental science; environmental studies; forest and natural resources management; landscape architecture; and paper and bioprocess engineering. Interdepartmental environmental science programs offer students integrative degrees across the natural sciences.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p>Many students identify themselves as a &quot;Stumpy&quot; (or &quot;Stumpie&quot;). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry &quot;stump jumpers&quot;. Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.</p>
<p>Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, <a>Bob Marshall</a> Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society, Soccer Club, Sigma Lambda Alpha Honor Society, <em>The Knothole</em> (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, <em>The Empire Forester</em> (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Habitat for Humanity, <em>Ecologue</em> (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, and Baobab Society. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the Society of American Foresters, Wildlife Society, <a>Conservation</a> Biology club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association.</p>
<p>ESF has an agreement with adjacent <a>Syracuse University</a> that allows its students enjoy many of the amenities offered by SU. ESF students can take SU classes, live in SU residence halls, and join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes.  Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration within the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the <a>Carrier Dome</a>. ESF degrees bear both the State University of New York and Syracuse University seals.</p>
<p>Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in <a>Syracuse</a>, and nearby <a>Marshall Street</a> and <a>Westcott Street</a>.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition most likely started in the 1980s or 1990s to inhibit tracks being worn into the grass. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as <a>Frisbee</a> and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad.</p>
<p>Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for <em>The Knothole</em>, and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.</p>
<p>Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.</p>
<p>Traditional events include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earth Week events</li>
  <li>Spring Banquet</li>
  <li>December Soiree</li>
  <li>Friends and Family BBQ</li>
