<p> </p>
<p><strong>Purdue University</strong>, located in <a>West Lafayette</a>, <a>Indiana</a>, <a>U.S.</a>, is the <a>flagship university</a> of the six-campus <a>Purdue University System</a>. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a <a>land-grant university</a> when the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a>, taking advantage of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, accepted a donation of land and money from <a>Lafayette</a> businessman <a>John Purdue</a> to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with three buildings, six instructors, and 39 students. </p>
<p>Purdue offers both <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> programs in over 210 <a>major</a> areas of study. Purdue has produced multiple Nobel Prize winners, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and NFL SuperBowl MVPs.   The university has been highly influential in America's <a>history of aviation</a>, and Purdue's <a>aviation</a> <a>technology</a> and <a>aeronautical engineering</a> programs remain among the highest rated and most competitive in the world. Purdue established the first <a>college credit</a> offered in <a>flight training</a>, the first four-year <a>bachelor's degree</a> in <a>aviation</a>, and the first university <a>airport</a> (<a>Purdue University Airport</a>). In the mid-20th century, Purdue's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced <a>spaceflight</a> technology giving rise to Purdue's nickname, <em>Cradle of Astronauts</em>. Twenty-two Purdue graduates have gone on to become <a>astronaut</a>s, including <a>Gus Grissom</a> (one of the original <a>Mercury Seven</a> astronauts), <a>Neil Armstrong</a> (the first person to walk on the moon), and <a>Eugene Cernan</a> (the last person to walk on the moon).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding and early years</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|John Purdue.</a> In 1865, the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a> took advantage of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, and began plans to establish an institution with a strong focus on engineering. <a>John Purdue</a>, a Lafayette business leader and <a>philanthropist</a> (buried at Purdue), sought to help establish a &quot;land grant&quot; college in Indiana. The state of Indiana received a gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, along with $50,000 from <a>Tippecanoe County</a>, and 150 acres (0.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. On May 6, 1869, it was decided that the college would be founded near the city of <a>Lafayette</a> and legislators established the institution as Purdue University, in the name of the institution&#x2019;s principal benefactor. The school is also one of the only institutions in the country that offers <a>AAAE</a> certification for the management of airports. Purdue's Aviation Technology Department is also actively involved and partners regularly with <a>National Business Aviation Association</a> and the <a>International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading</a> on a multitude of research projects.</p>
<p>In 2010, Purdue University received a $1.35 million grant from the <a>United States Air Force</a> to develop alternative fuels and test aircraft engines at a new facility. Purdue also purchased sixteen <a>Cirrus SR-20</a> training aircraft, one <a>Embraer Phenom 100</a> very light jet, and a <a>Bombardier CRJ 700</a> simulator for their exclusive flight training program which only accepts 60 people per year.</p>
<p>J. Clifford Turpin, from the class of 1908, was the first Purdue graduate to become an aviator, and received flight instruction from <a>Orville Wright</a>. In 1919 George W. Haskins became the first alumnus to land an aircraft on campus.</p>
<p>In 1930 Purdue became the first university in the country to offer college credit for flight training, and later became the first university to open its own airport, the <a>Purdue University Airport</a>. Famed aviator <a>Amelia Earhart</a> came to Purdue in 1935 and served as a &quot;Counselor on Careers for Women,&quot; a staff position she held until her disappearance in 1937. Purdue played a meaningful role in Earhart's ill-fated &quot;Flying Laboratory&quot; project, providing funds for the <a>Lockheed Model 10 Electra</a> aircraft she intended to fly around the world. Purdue's libraries maintain an extensive Earhart collection, which is still studied today by those seeking to solve the mystery of her disappearance. Purdue later named a residence hall in her honor, which is lined with Earhart pictures and articles.</p>
<p>At one point, Purdue University owned and operated a <a>charter airline</a> operation under <a>FAR</a> part 121 simply called &quot;Purdue Airlines&quot;. The company had a fleet of DC-9s, and was highly successful. In fact, <a>Hugh Hefner</a>'s famous <a>Playboy</a> <a>DC-9</a> aircraft was leased from Purdue, and its permanent storage was at Purdue University.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, Purdue&#x2019;s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics has awarded more aerospace engineering degrees than any other institution in the country, issuing 6% of all undergraduate degrees and 7% of all Ph.D. degrees. These alumni have led significant advances in research and development of aerospace technology, headed major corporations and government agencies, and have established an amazing record for exploration of space. Purdue's Student Concert Committee often invites famous entertainers to perform there for an audience of students, faculty, and the general public. Also near the Purdue Mall is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who perished in the <a>Purdue Wreck</a> railroad accident on October 31, 1903. The structure was renovated in 1985 to house the Computer Science department. In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department.</p>
<h3>Memorial Mall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Purdue Memorial Union</a> The Purdue Memorial Mall, located south of the Purdue Mall, is the original section of campus. A popular meeting place for students, the grassy, open Memorial Mall is surrounded by the Stewart Student Center, Stanley Coulter Hall, the Class of 1950 Lecture Hall, Recitation Building, Beverly Stone Hall, and University Hall. The Memorial Mall also features the Hello Walk. East of the Memorial Mall is the <a>Purdue Memorial Union</a>, Purdue's <a>student union</a> building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.</p>
<p>University Hall is the only building remaining from the original six-building campus. Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as &quot;The Main Building&quot;. The building was dedicated in 1877 and the project cost $35,000 to complete. University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms, but was remodeled in 1961 to house only the department of history and classrooms used by the School of Liberal Arts. According to folklore, at the request of <a>John Purdue</a>, he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.  The grave site with an unengraved headstone is maintained respectfully, however, there is dispute about whether Mr. Purdue is, or ever was, actually interred at the site.</p>
<h3>South campus</h3>
<p>The area south of State Street is home to Purdue's agricultural and veterinary buildings. This area also includes the <a>Horticulture Gardens</a>, <a>Discovery Park</a>, and the <a>Purdue Airport</a>.</p>
<h3>West campus</h3>
<p>The western portion of campus consists of student housing, dining, and recreation facilities. Students can play club and <a>intramural sports</a> at the Recreational Sports Center, the Boilermaker Aquatic Center, and the intramural playing fields in this area. Purdue's Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs. From January 2011 until August 2012, the building will undergo a <a>LEED</a>-certified expansion and renovation project to become the Student Wellness and Fitness Center.</p>
<h3>Stadium area</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Mackey Arena</a> Much of the northern part of campus sits on land purchased for the university by industrialist <a>David E. Ross</a> and author &amp; humorist <a>George Ade</a>. David Ross is one of two people buried on Purdue's campus (the other being John Purdue).  Many of Purdue's athletic facilities are located there, including <a>Ross&#x2013;Ade Stadium</a> (<a>American football</a>), <a>Mackey Arena</a> (<a>basketball</a>), and <a>Lambert Fieldhouse</a> (indoor <a>track &amp; field</a>). This area also includes the <a>Slayter Center of Performing Arts</a> and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.  David Ross' grave site is in a garden atop the hill just to west of the Slayter band shell.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Purdue offers more than 200 options for major areas of study at the West Lafayette campus alone, and a variety of options for minors. Purdue is organized into eight colleges and schools contained within larger colleges; the two exceptions are the <a>Krannert School of Management</a> and the <a>School of Veterinary Medicine</a>. These two academic units retained their &quot;school&quot; status during a university-wide renaming policy in 2004 and 2005 in deference to national <a>professional school</a> naming conventions. On July 1, 2010 the College of Health and Human Sciences was formed. The new college was created by combining existing academic units. These units include the School of Nursing, the School of Health Sciences, the College of Consumer and Family Sciences, and non-humanities majors from the College of Liberal Arts; namely psychology and hearing and speech pathology. </p>

Purdue employs 892 non-tenure-track faculty, Lecturers, and Postdoctorals at its West Lafayette campus. Purdue employs another 691 tenured and 1,021 Non-Tenure Track Faculty, Lecturers, and Postdoctorals at its Regional Campuses and Statewide Technology. Purdue University is considered by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> to have &quot;very high research activity&quot;. Purdue also was rated the nation's fourth best place to work in academia, according to rankings released in November 2007 by <em><a>The Scientist</a></em> magazine. Purdue's researchers provide insight, knowledge, assistance, and solutions in many crucial areas. These include, but are not limited to Agriculture; Business and Economy; Education; Engineering; Environment; Healthcare; Individuals, Society, Culture; Manufacturing; Science; Technology; Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<p>Purdue University generated a record $333.4 million in sponsored research funding during the 2007&#x2013;08 fiscal year with participation from <a>National Science Foundation</a>, <a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>, and the U.S. departments of <a>Agriculture</a>, <a>Defense</a>, <a>Energy</a>, and <a>Health and Human Services</a>.</p>
<p>Purdue University established the <a>Discovery Park</a> to bring innovation through multidisciplinary action. In all of the eleven centers of Discovery Park, ranging from entrepreneurship to energy and advanced manufacturing, research projects reflect a large economic impact and address global challenges. Purdue University's nanotechnology research program, built around the new Birck Nanotechnology Center in Discovery Park, ranks among the best in the nation.</p>
<p>The <a>Purdue Research Park</a> which opened in 1961 was developed by Purdue Research Foundation which is a private, nonprofit foundation created to assist Purdue. The park is focused on companies operating in the arenas of life sciences, homeland security, engineering, advanced manufacturing and information technology. It provides an interactive environment for experienced Purdue researchers and private business and high-tech industry.</p>

<p>The <a>University President</a>, appointed by the <a>Board of Trustees</a>, is the <a>chief administrative officer</a> of the university. The office of the president oversees admission and registration, student conduct and counseling, the administration and scheduling of classes and space, the administration of student athletics and organized extracurricular activities, the libraries, the appointment of the faculty and conditions of their employment, the appointment of all non-faculty employees and the conditions of employment, the general organization of the university, and the planning and administration of the university budget.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees directly appoints other major officers of the university including a <a>provost</a>, who serves as the chief academic officer for the university, a number of vice presidents with oversight over specific university operations, and the satellite campus chancellors.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Purdue's Sustainability Council, composed of University administrators and professors, meets monthly to discuss environmental issues and sustainability initiatives at Purdue. The University is currently constructing its first <a>LEED</a> Certified building in an addition to the Mechanical Engineering building, which is to be completed in Spring 2011. The school is also in the process of developing an arboretum on campus. In addition, a system has been set up to display live data detailing current energy production at the campus utility plant.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student body</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Graduation Ceremony</a> The Purdue student body is composed primarily of students from <a>Indiana</a>. In 2006&#x2013;07, 23,086 out of a total of 39,288 students enrolled were Indiana residents. As of 2007, the racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 86.9% <a>white</a>, 5.51% <a>Asian</a>, 3.53% <a>African American</a>, and 2.75% <a>Hispanic</a>. Of these students, 41.2% are female. Domestic minorities constitute a total of 15.4% in the Graduate student body population is <a>international</a>, representing 123 countries. In graduate student population, non-residents occupy an overwhelming majority, about 78%. Almost all undergraduates and about 70% of the graduate student population attend full-time. Of the residence halls, Cary and Tarkington are male-only while Windsor is female-only; the remainder are <a>coed</a>. The newest residence hall, First Street Towers, opened in July 2009 and is exclusively for upperclassmen.</p>
<p>There are 12 <a>cooperative</a> houses at Purdue (5 men's houses and 7 women's houses). The men's houses include Circle Pines, Fairway, Marwood, Chauncey, and Gemini. The women's houses include Ann Tweedale, Glenwood, Twin Pines, Maclure, Stewart, Devonshire, and Shoemaker. All cooperative houses are governed under the Purdue Cooperative Council which is led by Purdue University students who live in these houses. The cooperative system claims that it allows for a much lower cost of living than other types of housing, as the members take an active role in sharing chores and cooking all meals themselves, as opposed to hiring out cleaning and cooking staff.</p>
<p>Purdue University hosts the nation's third largest <a>Greek community</a>, with approximately 5,000 students participating in one of the 46 men's fraternities or 29 women's sororities. Several of Purdue's most distinguished graduates are members of fraternities and sororities.</p>
<p>The &quot;Movie Tribute Show with Erik Mygrant&quot; was created in a small television studio (now known as the Erik Mygrant Studio) on campus in 1999.</p>
<p><a>WBAA</a> is a <a>radio station</a> owned by Purdue University. The station operates on the AM frequency of 920&nbsp;kHz and FM frequency of 101.3&nbsp;MHz. Its studios are in the <a>Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music</a> on the Purdue campus, and the transmitters are located in <a>Lafayette, Indiana</a>. WBAA is the longest continuously-operating radio station in Indiana, having been licensed on April 4, 1922. WBAA airs <a>NPR</a> and local news/talk programming during the day. Overnight, the AM station airs <a>jazz</a> while the FM station airs <a>classical music</a>.</p>
<p>There are also a few <a>student radio</a> stations on campus. Currently, three operate from <a>residence halls</a>, broadcasting via internet only; WCCR from Cary Quadrangle (not to be confused with the current WCCR FM or WCCR-LP stations in other states), WILY from Wiley Hall, and WHHR from Harrison Hall. A fourth student station, the Purdue Student Radio club operates from the <a>Purdue Memorial Union</a> and broadcasts on low power AM in addition to internet streaming.</p>
<p>W9YB is the <a>callsign</a> of the <a>Amateur Radio Club</a> at Purdue University. W9YB also holds the self declared title of having one of the largest and most active collegiate <a>amateur radio</a> stations in the country. W9YB actively participates in <a>emergency management</a> for the <a>Tippecanoe County</a> area and maintains ready status with its members in skills to assist.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> [[Image:Tiller pu.jpg|thumb|right|Former Purdue Football head coach, [[Joe Tiller]]]] Purdue is home to 18 Division I/I-A <a>NCAA</a> teams including football, basketball, cross country, tennis, wrestling, golf, volleyball and others. Purdue is a founding member of the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>, and played a central role in its creation. Traditional rivals include Big Ten colleagues the <a>Indiana</a> <a>Hoosiers</a>, the <a>Illinois</a> <a>Fighting Illini</a>, and the <a>Notre Dame</a> <a>Fighting Irish</a> from the <a>Big East Conference</a> (football program independent, however). </p>
<p>Purdue is tied with Alabama in producing the most Super Bowl winning quarterbacks. <a>Len Dawson</a> (SB IV, MVP), <a>Bob Griese</a> (SB VII and VIII), and <a>Drew Brees</a> (SB XLIV, MVP).</p>
<p>The Boilermaker men's and women's basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships than any other conference school, with 27 conference banners, including a league-leading 22 for the men&#x2019;s team. Purdue men's basketball has an all-time winning record against all Big Ten schools.</p>
<h2>Insignia and traditions</h2>
<h3>Boilermakers</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Purdue Pete &#x2013; one of the most recognized symbols of Purdue University</a>  The moniker for the University's athletics teams has become a popular reference for all things Purdue. A reporter first used the name in 1891 to describe the year's winning football team and quickly gained approval from students.</p>
<h3>Mascots, logos, and colors</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Boilermaker special.jpg|thumb|[[Boilermaker Special]] - the official mascot of Purdue University]] --&gt; In the more than 130 years since the founding of the university, several mascots have emerged in support of the Boilermaker athletic teams, including: The <a>Boilermaker Special</a>, <a>Purdue Pete</a>, and more recently, Rowdy.</p>
<p>The <a>Boilermaker Special</a> has been the official mascot of Purdue University since 1940. Designed to look like a train locomotive, the Special was originally designed to demonstrate Purdue's engineering programs and is maintained by the members of the Purdue Reamer Club.</p>
<p>As the unofficial mascot of Purdue Athletics, <a>Purdue Pete</a> is one of the most recognized symbols of Purdue University.</p>
<p>An  statue of &quot;<a>The Boilermaker</a>&quot; was erected in 2005 across from Ross Ade Stadium.</p>
<p>Purdue University adopted its school colors, <a>Old Gold</a> and Black, in the fall of 1887. Members of Purdue's first football team in 1887 felt that the squad should be distinguished by certain colors, and since Princeton was at the time the most successful gridiron unit, its colors were considered. Though actually orange and black, the Princeton colors were known by many as yellow and black. Purdue gridders opted for old gold over yellow, kept the black, and began flying the colors that endure today.</p>
<h3>Seal</h3>
<p>The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the University's centennial in 1969. The seal, approved by the Board of Trustees, was designed by Prof. Al Gowan, formerly at Purdue. It replaced one that had been in use for 73 years, but was never officially accepted by the board.</p>
<p>In medieval heraldry, a griffin symbolized strength, and Abby P. Lytle used it in her 1895 design for a Purdue seal. When Professor Gowan redesigned the seal, he retained the griffin symbol to continue identification with the older, unofficial seal. As on the older seal, the words &quot;Purdue University&quot; are set in the typeface Uncial. The three-part shield indicates three stated aims of the University: education, research, and service, replacing the words Science, Technology, and Agriculture on the earlier version.</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p> The official <a>fight song</a> of Purdue University, &quot;<a>Hail Purdue!</a>&quot;, was composed in 1912 by alumni Edward Wotawa (music) and James Morrison (lyrics) as the &quot;Purdue War Song&quot;. &quot;Hail Purdue&quot; was copyrighted in 1913 and dedicated to the <a>Varsity Glee Club</a>.</p>
<h3>Grand Prix</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This 50-mile, 160-lap go-kart race is &quot;The Greatest Spectacle in College Racing&quot; and wraps up Gala Week each year. All 33 participating karts are made from scratch by student teams. The event has been raising money for student scholarships since it began in 1958.  It was created as a counter-part to Indiana University's <a>Little 500</a>.</p>
<h3>Old Oaken Bucket</h3>
<p>Found on a farm in southern <a>Indiana</a>, the oaken bucket is one of the oldest football trophies in the nation. The winner of the annual Purdue vs. <a>Indiana University</a> <a>American football</a> game gets to add a bronze &quot;P&quot; or &quot;I&quot; chain link and keep the trophy until the next face-off. Ironically, the first competition in 1925 led to a 0&#x2013;0 tie, resulting in the first link on the chain being an &quot;IP.&quot; Purdue currently leads the trophy series at 55-26-3.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p> [[Image:Neil Armstrong pose.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neil Armstrong]]]] Purdue alumni has achieved strong recognition in a wide range of areas, but particularly in science and industry. </p>
