<p><strong>National Tsing Hua University</strong> (; abbreviated as <strong>NTHU</strong>) is one of the most prestigious universities in <a>Taiwan</a>. The university has a strong reputation in the studies of science and engineering. There are now 7 colleges, 17 departments and 22 independent graduate institutes in the university. Many Taiwanese business and academic elites received their education in NTHU. The university also produced 12 <a>academicians</a> of the <a>Academia Sinica</a> and one <a>Nobel prize</a> laureate, <a>Lee Yuan-tseh</a> (<a>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>, 1986), the first Taiwanese to receive the prize. The campus is conveniently located, neighboring several national research institutes and <a>Hsinchu Science Park</a>, the <a>silicon valley</a> of Taiwan. </p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>After the <a>Chinese Civil War</a>, some academics and staff from the mainland's <a>Tsinghua University</a> created the <strong>National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology</strong> in 1955 in <a>Hsinchu</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>, which later became <strong>National Tsing Hua University</strong>. </p>
<p>The two Tsinghua Universities are not affiliated with each other, but both claim to be successors of the original Tsinghua University. As a result of this dispute, both universities claimed to be the rightful recipient of the funds from the <a>Boxer Rebellion</a> indemnity that was used to start Tsinghua University. This indemnity was transferred to the university in Taiwan after the Nationalist government (KMT) retreated to Taiwan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:National_Tsinghua_University_Taiwan_OldGate.jpg|thumb|200px|Replica of the [[Tsinghua_University#Campus|Old Gate]] in <a>Beijing</a>, symbol of Tsinghua University]]  First established as the Tsing Hua <a>Academy</a> at Tsing Hua Garden in <a>Beijing</a> in 1911, the Academy was renamed as National Tsing Hua University in 1928 as its curricula expanded to that of a full-fledged university. In 1956, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) was reinstalled on its current campus in <a>Hsinchu</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>.</p>
<p>Since its reinstallation, <a>NTHU</a> has developed from an institute focusing on <a>Nuclear Science</a> and <a>Technology</a> to that of a comprehensive research university offering degrees programs ranging from <a>baccalaureate</a> to <a>doctorate</a> in <a>science</a>, <a>technology</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>humanities</a> and <a>social sciences</a>, as well as <a>management</a>. <a>NTHU</a> has been consistently ranked as one of the <a>premier</a> universities in <a>Taiwan</a> and is widely recognized as the best incubator for future leaders in industries as well as academics. Such stellar records are particularly exemplified by the outstanding achievements of alumni, including two <a>Nobel</a> laureates in <a>physics</a> Dr. <a>Chen-Ning Yang</a> and <a>Tsung-Dao Lee</a>, one <a>Nobel</a> laureate in <a>chemistry</a> Dr. <a>Yuan-Tseh Lee</a> and one <a>Wolf Prize</a> winner in <a>mathematics</a> Dr. <a>Shiing-Shen Chern</a>.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan has had increasingly close ties with the Tsinghua University on the mainland, and of all universities on Taiwan, the NTHU has arguably one of the strongest cooperations with universities in mainland China in terms of academic research, projects, and with the creation of programs such as the &quot;Center for Contemporary China.&quot;</p>
<h2>Tradition</h2>
<p><strong>Meichu Tournament</strong>&lt;br /&gt; <a>Meichu Tournament</a>, held in March annually, is a <a>sport</a> <a>competition</a> between National Tsing Hua University and <a>National Chiao Tung University</a>. Since its establishment in 1969, <a>Meichu</a> Game has become a <a>tradition</a>, and is considered as one of the most important activities between these two prestigious universities.</p>
<p>We could trace the history of <a>Meichu</a> Game to the 1960s. After the end of the <a>Chinese Civil War</a> in 1949, <a>Tsing Hua University</a> and <a>Chiao Tung University</a> were both relocated in <a>Hsin Chu</a>, <a>Taiwan</a> and became neighbors. The geographic and academic closeness prompted many intellectual and social exchanges between two universities.</p>
<p>In 1966, an informal tournament was held. The arrangement of the formal event, however, was not institutionalized until 1968, when Mr. <a>Chian Feng</a>, an executive officer of <a>NTHU</a> student activity center, received the permission from the university authority to plan sport events for <a>NTHU</a> and <a>NCTU</a> students modeling after the <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> <a>Boat Race</a>.</p>
<p>While both side agreed on the plan to hold such an annual event, there was a disagreement on the naming of the Game. At last, Prof. <a>Zhang Zhi-Yi</a> solved this problem by proposing the conventional coin tossing. &#x201c;If the head-side is up, the game would be called <a>Mei-Chu</a>; otherwise, the game would be called Chu-Mei.&#x201d; As the head-side of the coin went up, the tournament was thereby named <a>Meichu</a> to commemorate the two founding presidents of <a>NTHU</a> and <a>NCTU</a>, Dr. <a>Mei Yi-chi</a>, and Dr. <a>Ling Chu-Ming</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<h3>Student Clubs</h3>
<p>There are more than one hundred student clubs serving diverse interests. Club activities range from community services, music and sports, cinema and theater, dancing and martial arts, religion and philosophy as well as various scientific and academic interests. While their interests vary, these clubs are all organized and run by and for students.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>There are eighteen dormitories on campus accommodating about 5000 students.Freshman,sophomore and most of the graduate students are allowed to lodge at dorms without drawing lots. The majority of NTHU faculty members are also living on campus.</p>
<h3>Scholarships,Fellowships,and Financial Aid</h3>
<p>Scholarships and fellowships are awarded on a meritorious basis. Annually more than six hundred undergraduates and one hundred graduate students receive such supports. In addition, around four thousand graduate students are supported with teaching or research assistantships from various academic units. For students with financial difficulties, the University provides student-loans and emergency funds.</p>
<h3>Health Care and Counseling Services</h3>
<p>A University Clinic, affiliated with Hsinchu <a>Mackay</a> Memorial Hospital, is conveniently located on campus where first aids and general medical services are provided by a team of physicians and health care specialists at a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The NTHU offers various counseling service to students, faculty and staff members at the University Counseling Center. The clinic and the center not only provide services when needed, but also organize and present educational programs for all students.</p>
