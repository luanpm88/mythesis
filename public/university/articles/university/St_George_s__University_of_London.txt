<p><strong>St George's, University of London</strong> (<strong>SGUL</strong>), previously known as <strong>St George's Hospital Medical School</strong> (<strong>SGHMS</strong>), is a specialist <a>medical college</a> of the <a>University of London</a>, and one of the <a>United Hospitals</a>. The college has its origins in 1733, and was the second institution in <a>England</a> to provide formal training courses for doctors (after the <a>University of Oxford</a>). St George's Hospital Medical School affiliated with the University of London soon after the latter's establishment in 1836. As of 2008 the medical school accepted around 100 graduates, 175 undergraduates and 10 students from overseas making it one of the larger UK medical schools. </p>
<p>Originally set up in 1733 next to <a>Hyde Park Corner</a> (now the site of <a>The Lanesborough</a> hotel), in central <a>London</a>, the college was transferred to its current site, <a>Tooting</a> in <a>South London</a> in 1980, where it shares a site with <a>St George's Healthcare NHS Trust</a>. Following <a>Quality Assurance Agency</a> inspections St George's gained a score of 23 out of 24 for its teaching of medicine  &#x2014; the highest of any of the London medical schools and, by academic teaching standards, the best medical school in London, second only to <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> among England's 25 or so medical schools. The inspections report was published in January 2000 and the course, curriculum and teaching methods at St George's have changed since then. </p>
<p>In recent years, the university has expanded beyond its medical schools roots. Alongside its medical course now runs a Biomedical Sciences course, which has expanded to meet demand in the last 5 years from an initial intake of 30, to 150 students. There are now more places for Undergraduate Biomedical Science students than 5-Year Medical students.</p>
<p>In partnership with <a>Kingston University</a>, The Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences has moved St George's into other areas. Amongst these are Nursing, Physiotherapy, Paramedic Science and Radiography. The Faculty has been congratulated for its high teaching standards, employment rates and cutting edge research in the social sciences.</p>
<p>St George's was also the first institution in the United Kingdom to offer a four year graduate entry medicine degree based on the program from <a>Flinders University</a> with which it has an exchange program. The first intake was in 2000 with 35 students and the course has since been emulated by many other universities. Entry to the course is highly competitive with candidates being required to sit the <a>GAMSAT</a> as part of the application process.</p>
<p>Most recently St George's, along with other London medical schools, has been the setting for new television drama <a>Vital Signs</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008, St George's announced that it planned to merge with <a>Royal Holloway</a> to form a single institution within the University of London. The merger was called off in a joint statement by the two colleges' principals on 25 September 2009. St George's intends to keep working with Royal Holloway in the field of health and social care along with its well-established Joint Faculty with Kingston University. St George's, Kingston University and Royal Holloway will continue to collaborate in the field of health and social care as part of the existing SWan (South West London Academic Network) healthcare alliance.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The Students' Union (until recently, the School Club) organises various activities including fancy dress discos and a <a>Rag Week</a>, the annual series of fund-raising events, which in the year 2007-2008 raised around &#x00a3;80,000 for various charities including Cancer Research, Barnardos and Leonard Cheshire. Year on year St George's raises more money for charity per capita than any other London medical school.  In recent years the Union has become more politically aware and shown greater interest in <a>National Union of Students</a> and <a>British Medical Association</a> activities.</p>
<p>St George's also has a number of sports clubs including swimming, rowing, volleyball, rugby, football, netball, hockey and many others. In 2007-2008 the Men's and Women's Hockey teams both managed to win their respective ULU Premier Divisions.</p>
<p>Each new student at St George's is assigned a 'mum' or 'dad' in the year above. These 'parents' act as mentors for the new students, giving them advice about the course, often tutoring them when needed, as well as buying them drinks during Freshers' Week and beyond. Over the years the family expands to include siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents etc, spanning all the years of the various courses.</p>
<p>The university owns one hall of residence, Horton Halls, a large, modern site first opened to new students in late September 2007. This replaced St. George's Grove. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|240px|</a> --&gt;</p>
<h2>George's Song</h2>
<p>The legend among students of St. George's states that, after slaying the great dragon, St. George sat down and wrote his sentiments on such a glorious occasion. The following words are believed to be from the immortal legend himself, revamped to a slightly more modern song (I don't want to join the army):</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t want to go to Mary&#x2019;s </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t want to go to Bart&#x2019;s </p>
<p>And they say the Royal Free, is not the place to be </p>
<p>And Tommie&#x2019;s is a place for high-born fairies </p>
<p>UCL's a dump in central London </p>
<p>King&#x2019;s is a hovel on the strand</p>
<p>ON THE STRAND! </p>
<p>I&#x2019;d rather go to George&#x2019;s,</p>
<p>To merry, merry George&#x2019;s</p>
<p>&#x2018;Cos George&#x2019;s is the finest in the land, &#x2018;Cor Blimey!</p>
<p>There are two more verses to the song, but these are shrouded in secrecy</p>
