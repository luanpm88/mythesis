<p> [[Image:Union Theological Seminary LC-USZ62-74646.jpg|thumb|Side view at [[Claremont Avenue]] between 120th and 119th streets (1910)]] <strong>Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York</strong> is a preeminent independent graduate school of <a>theology</a>, located in <a>Manhattan</a> between <a>Claremont Avenue</a> and <a>Broadway</a>, 120th to 122nd Streets. The <a>seminary</a> was founded in 1836 under the <a>Presbyterian Church</a>, and is currently affiliated with nearby <a>Columbia University</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The brick and limestone <a>English Gothic architecture</a>, by Francis R. Allen (1844 &#x2013; 1931) and Collins, completed in 1910, includes the tower (<em>pictured</em>), which adapts features of the crossing tower of <a>Durham Cathedral</a>. The Seminary is also adjacent to <a>Teachers College</a>, <a>Barnard College</a>, the <a>Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a> and the <a>Manhattan School of Music</a> and has cross-registration and library access agreements with several of these schools. The building was added to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> on April 23, 1980. Due to declining enrollments, large sections of the campus are now on long-term lease to Columbia University.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The seminary was founded in 1836, and is one of the most prestigious divinity schools in the country. During the late-19th Century, Union Theological Seminary (UTS) became one of the leading centers of <a>liberal Christianity</a> in the United States. In 1939 the <a>Auburn Theological Seminary</a> moved to its campus.</p>
<p>Among its graduates were the historian of Christianity <a>Arthur McGiffert</a>, biblical scholar <a>James Moffett</a>, <a>Harry Emerson Fosdick</a>, pastor of <a>Riverside Church</a>, who served as professor during his tenure there, and the Socialist leader <a>Norman Thomas</a>. It is home to the <strong>Burke Theological Library</strong>, which is the largest theological library in the Western Hemisphere and serves a national and international field of scholars, pastors, and students. It contains more than 700,000 volumes, periodicals, manuscripts, scores, and rare historic materials.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Union Theological Seminary entrance on Broadway</a> In 1895, members of the Union Theological Seminary Alumni Club founded <a>Union Settlement Association</a>, one of one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City.  After visiting Toynbee Hall in London, and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the East River and Central Park. Known as East Harlem, it was a neighborhood filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services. The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to &#x201c;settle&#x201d; in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents. &#x201c;It seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,&#x201d; wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892&#x2013;1930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915&#x2013;1919).  Union Settlement still exists, providing community-based services and programs to support the immigrant and low-income residents of East Harlem.  One of East Harlem&#x2019;s largest social service agencies, Union Settlement reaches more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem, through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development and neighborhood cultural events.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2008, feminist theologian <a>Serene Jones</a> became Union's first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding <a>Joseph C. Hough, Jr.</a></p>
<p>&quot;Union has a distinguished history among graduate theological institutions. Its faculty has always ranked among the best in the world and has included such luminaries as <a>Walter Rauschenbusch</a>, <a>Reinhold Niebuhr</a>, <a>Paul Tillich</a>, <a>Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a>, <a>James Cone</a>, and others. Its students come from around the country and the world. The seminary is known for its progressive understanding of religion in general, and Christianity in particular, and has long been at the forefront of the great social movements in this nation's history.&quot;</p>
<h2>Faculty</h2>
<p>Dr. Serene Jones, the seminary's first female president, was inaugurated in November 2008. Dr. Joseph Hough, UTS' immediate past president, is an important Christian Democratic Socialist. <a>Henry Sloane Coffin</a> was a past president. Dr. <a>James Hal Cone</a> is one of the founders of <a>liberation theology</a> and is especially important in the development of African-American theology. Union has also been home to many prominent Womanist theologians such as Delores Williams. Dr. <a>Gary Dorrien</a> is a leading social ethicist. Dr. <a>James A. Forbes</a>, the former senior pastor of the adjacent <a>Riverside Church</a>, is an adjunct professor at the seminary and had been a full-time, chaired professor before accepting the Riverside post.</p>
<p><a>Reinhold Niebuhr</a> and <a>Paul Tillich</a> made UTS the center of both liberal and <a>neo-orthodox</a> Protestantism in the post-War period. Prominent public intellectual Dr. <a>Cornel West</a> commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977. As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s (while neo-orthodoxy dissipated) and thus declined in prestige, UTS ran into financial difficulties, and shrank significantly because of a reduced student base. Eventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia. These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.</p>
<h2>Degrees</h2>
<p>The school confers <a>Master of Arts</a>, <a>Master of Divinity</a>, <a>Master of Sacred Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a>, and offers joint degree programs with <a>Columbia University</a>. The school has long been associated with <a>ecumenism</a>.</p>
