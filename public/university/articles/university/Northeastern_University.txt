<p><strong>Northeastern University</strong> (officially <strong>NU</strong>, formerly <strong>NEU</strong>), is a <a>private</a> research university in <a>Boston, Massachusetts</a>. Northeastern has eight colleges and offers 65 undergraduate majors. At the graduate level, the university offers more than 125 programs and awards masters, doctoral, and professional degrees.</p>
<p>Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a leader in interdisciplinary research, urban engagement, and the integration of classroom learning with real-world experience.  The university is the home of more than 35 specialized research and education centers. Northeastern is classified as a RU/H institution (high research activity) by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.  Northeastern's faculty members have garnered international recognition for their achievements in teaching and research. Several <a>Guggenheim Fellows</a> are currently or have been previously associated with Northeastern. Among Northeastern's other distinguished faculty are a <a>MacArthur Foundation</a> &quot;Genius Award&quot; winner, a former <a>NASA</a> <a>Astronaut</a>, and a <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winner.</p>
<p>Northeastern&#x2019;s <a>cooperative education (co-op)</a> program was one of the first of its kind in the world.  Through the co-op program, students complete eight semesters of full-time study and up to three six-month terms of paid full-time work. The program has been regularly ranked as the best co-op program in the country.  The university has a large selection of corporate and non-profit co-op partners both in the United States and abroad. Employers have included major newspapers, popular television shows, top ranked international law firms, banks, and corporations and many <a>Fortune 500</a> companies such as <a>Microsoft</a>, <a>Disney</a>, and <a>Procter &amp; Gamble</a>. Participating students typically receive their undergraduate degree in five years, however a four year option is also available for most majors with fewer co-ops. Northeastern was ranked #1 by the Princeton Review for &quot;Best Internships/Career Services&quot; 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.</p>
<p>Northeastern&#x2019;s  award winning campus  is located in the <a>Fenway Cultural District</a> of Boston. In 2010 and 2011, <a>US News &amp; World Report</a> rated Northeastern as the No. 2 &quot;Best Up-and-coming&quot; National University. Northeastern ranked No. 4 in <a>Forbes Magazine</a> as one of &quot;America's Most Entrepreneurial Campuses.&quot; The School of Architecture was ranked #12 by the Key Institute National Rankings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:huntington ymca.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Huntington Avenue]] <a>YMCA</a> circa 1920, site of the &quot;Evening Institute for Younger Men&quot;]] Northeastern was established in 1898 as the &quot;Evening Institute for Younger Men&quot; at the <a>Huntington Avenue</a> <a>YMCA</a>. Its first class was held October 3, 1898. The institute catered to the needs of the rapidly growing immigrant population in Boston. Within a few years of its formation, it offered classes in <a>law</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>finance</a>. In 1909 the school began offering day classes and it moved to a new location on Huntington Avenue in 1913. The school was officially organized as a college in 1916 and in 1922 it was renamed &quot;Northeastern University of the Boston Young Men's Christian Association.&quot; In a period of rapid campus expansion, the university purchased the <a>Huntington Avenue Grounds</a> (former <a>Boston Red Sox</a> ballpark) in 1929, but did not build on the land due to financial constraints during <a>The Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p>In 1935, the College of Liberal Arts was added to Northeastern, and the university's name was simplified to &quot;Northeastern University.&quot; In 1937 The Northeastern University Corporation was established, creating a board of trustees made up of 31 members of the NU Corporation and 8 members of the <a>YMCA</a>. In 1948 Northeastern separated itself completely from the YMCA.</p>
<p>Following <a>World War II</a>, Northeastern began admitting women, and in the boom of post-war college-bound students, Northeastern created a College of Education (1953), University College (now called the School of Professional &amp; Continuing Studies) (1960), College of Pharmacy and College of Nursing (1964). The College of Pharmacy and College of Nursing were subsequently combined into the Bouv&#x00e9; College of Health Sciences. Northeastern also added the College of Criminal Justice (1967) and College of Computer Science (1982), which has since been renamed the College of Computer and Information Science.</p>
<p>Similar to a number of urban universities, Northeastern began as a commuter school with many part-time and evening students, and by the early 1980s had grown to 60,000 enrollees. In the 1990s, the university reduced the number of enrolled students in order to become a &quot;smaller, better&quot; university and began building more residence halls on campus. It cut its freshman class size from around 4500 students to 2800 students.</p>
<p>From 1996 to 2006, President Richard Freeland led an institutional change; average SAT scores increased more than 200 points, retention rates rose dramatically, and applications doubled. President Freeland oversaw Northeastern&#x2019;s largest expansion ever, opening $455 million in new facilities, including residence halls, academic and research facilities, and athletic centers. The institution also became substantially more selective, leading to a more academically talented student body. [[Image:Northeastern Shillman Hall.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Robert J. Shillman|Robert J. Shillman Hall]] constructed in 1995]]</p>
<p>During the transition, students experienced a re-organization of the co-operative education system to better integrate classroom learning with workplace experience. The university also switched its full-time undergraduate and graduate programs to a new academic calendar comprising two traditional semesters and two summer &quot;minimesters&quot;, replacing the four-quarter system. This new calendar allowed students to delve more deeply into their academic courses and to experience longer, more substantive co-op placements.</p>
<p>Throughout the transformation, President Freeland's oft-repeated goal was to crack the Top 100 of the U.S. News rankings, which was accomplished in 2006. With this goal accomplished and the transformation from commuting school to national research university complete, he stepped down from the presidency on August 15, 2006. His successor is Dr. <a>Joseph Aoun</a>, formerly a <a>dean</a> at <a>University of Southern California</a>. Since coming into office in the fall of 2006, President Aoun has implemented a decentralized management model, giving the academic deans of the university more control over their own budgets, faculty hiring decisions, and fundraising. He has led the development and implementation of a new academic plan and an updated mission statement. </p>
<p>As part of Northeastern's five-year, $75 million Academic Investment Plan, the University is enhancing its academic programs in three areas: undergraduate education, core graduate professional programs and centers of research excellence. The cornerstone of the Academic Investment Plan is the expansion of University faculty by 100 tenured and tenure-track professors between 2004 and 2009. This plan was recently expanded to provide for the hiring of an additional 300 tenure and tenure-track faculty in interdisciplinary fields. Aoun has also placed more emphasis on improving town relations by reaching out to leaders of the communities surrounding the university. In addition, Aoun has created more academic partnerships with other institutions in the Boston area including <a>Tufts</a>, <a>Hebrew College</a> and the <a>School of the Museum of Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>Under Aoun's leadership, the university continues to climb in the rankings. In the 2011 edition of <a>U.S. News and World Report's</a> &quot;Best Colleges Guide&quot;, Northeastern increased its ranking to 69th, up 11 spots from 2010.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The University Honors Program targets strong and engaged students and offers them an enhanced curriculum. Starting with the First Year Reading Project and moving on to participating in a wide range of course offerings during the undergraduate years, the program allows students to engage in a variety of academic choices. The culminating experience is advanced specialty work in a major field through college-specific choices including specialized advanced honors seminars and an independent research project. In addition, students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Village F and Kennedy Hall. Since Fall 2009, first-year Honors students are housed in the North Tower of the newly-constructed International Village residence hall.</p>
<h3>Senior Capstone</h3>
<p>The Senior Capstone is an advanced level course related to the student's major. The course requires the student to integrate what they have learned through their academic coursework and their experiential learning experience (co-op, research, study abroad, and service learning).</p>
<h3>Pre-Med Program</h3>
<p>The university recently partnered with <a>Tufts University School of Medicine</a> to create an early acceptance BA/MD Program. Northeastern's campus is just a few blocks from the <a>Longwood Medical and Academic Area</a> where <a>Harvard Medical School</a> and <a>Harvard School of Dental Medicine</a> are located and world class teaching hospitals such as <a>Dana Farber</a>, <a>Children's Hospital Boston</a>, <a>New England Baptist Hospital</a> and <a>Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>. These institutions provide NU pre-med students with unparalleled internship opportunities. Boston is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. Well known companies such as <a>Boston Scientific</a>, <a>Biogen</a>, <a>Novartis</a>, and <a>Genzyme</a> also provide an avenue for pre-med research co-ops.</p>
<h3>Study abroad</h3>
<p>Northeastern has semester-long study abroad programs with placements around the globe in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Some participating schools include: <a>University of Edinburgh</a>, Scotland; <a>University of Cape Town</a>, South Africa; <a>University of Cambridge</a> and <a>London School of Economics</a>, England; <a>University of Auckland</a>, New Zealand; <a>Swinburne University of Technology</a>, Australia; <a>Obirin University</a>, Japan; <a>American College of Thessaloniki</a>, Greece and <a>Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile</a>, Chile and also Antarctica</p>
<p>Northeastern's International Business program is a fully integrated member of the <a>International Partnership of Business Schools</a>. Through this program International Business students have the opportunity to be awarded a dual-degree from Northeastern University as well as from a leading sister school in Europe, Mexico or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Northeastern also has the notable Dialogues of Civilizations program, which features dozens of one month-long programs (usually taking place in the summer) where a faculty member will lead a group of students in the country of their choice. A sort of &quot;mini&quot; study abroad, each program has an area of focus - for example, the Geneva program focuses on small arms and multilateral negotiations while the South Africa program is based in non-governmental organizations. This program differs from traditional study abroad in that it involves a series of meetings and discussions between students and local government leaders, community organizations, and their peers. It is meant to be a communicative experience and an exchange of ideas and cultures. It is open to all majors and all years, and is the most popular study abroad option at Northeastern.</p>
<p>Recently, the school has also been emphasizing co-op abroad, in an effort to make the school more international and experience driven. There are many programs being offered including social entrepreneurship to Domincan Republic, Belize, and South Africa. </p>

<p>The university also provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to engage in research through the Center for Experiential Education, CenSSIS Research Experience for Undergraduates,  Honors Research, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, and Provost's Office research grants. In FY 2007, annual external research funding exceeded $78 million. In FY 2009-2010, the research funding is close to $82 million. In 2002, Northeastern's Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems was designated an NSF Engineering Research Center. In 2004, Northeastern was one of six institutions to be selected by the National Science Foundation as a center for research in nanotechnology. In 2010, Northeastern was granted $12 million by an alum for a [[Homeland security]] research facility to be based at the school. The facility is to be named the [[George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security]], after its chief benefactor. Started in 1909, NU's co-op program is one of the oldest in the nation. In the co-op program, students alternate periods of academic study with periods of paid professional employment related to their major. Most majors offer a four-year graduation option with fewer co-op placements, but the five year program is more popular with students. The co-op program typically starts sophomore year (after a traditional freshman year).</p>
<p>Co-op placements range from small dynamic start-up companies to large multinational companies with thousands of employees, including <a>Fortune 500</a> corporations such as <a>Microsoft</a>, <a>Cisco Systems</a>, <a>EMC</a>, <a>Disney</a>, <a>Sony</a>, and <a>Raytheon</a>, financial services companies such as <a>John Hancock Financial</a>, <a>Goldman Sachs</a>, <a>Merrill Lynch</a> and <a>Fidelity Investments</a>, and many other well known companies. The program also places students with government agencies, branches of government, nonprofits, and <a>non-governmental organizations</a>. Northeastern students can be found interning in the <a>United States Congress</a>, the <a>White House</a>, <a>United Nations</a>, and at <a>NASA</a>. Student placements usually last six months, and are mostly paid. Unlike some co-op programs, Northeastern students do not pay tuition during periods of employment.</p>
<p>Students may live in the university residence halls on campus during periods of co-op employment (room and board is charged). The university currently leases housing for students co-oping in <a>New York City</a> and <a>Washington, D.C.</a> and are working on offering the same for Philadelphia and Miami. The university's <a>Co-op Connections</a> office also helps students find suitable housing in other American cities and internationally.</p>
<p>By sampling different work environments and varied types of positions, students gain valuable insight into the type of career they want to pursue before committing to a post-graduation position. The typical Northeastern student will graduate with three co-op placements under their belt, an impressive resume, and a list of contacts, giving Northeastern graduates an edge in the job market over graduates from most other schools.  Many Northeastern students accept a permanent position from one of their former co-op employers. </p>
<p>Northeastern University is also a partner with the <a>Boston Youth Fund</a>, which is run by the Boston Youth council and provides summer job and enrichment placement for the City of Boston.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Cy young northeastern cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|A photograph of the [[Cy Young]] statue by sculptor Robert Shure in 1993, located in front of Churchill Hall on the former <a>Huntington Avenue Grounds</a>.]] Northeastern is located in Boston's <a>Fenway</a>, <a>Roxbury</a> and <a>Back Bay</a> neighborhoods adjacent to <a>Huntington Avenue</a> near the <a>Museum of Fine Arts</a> and <a>Symphony Hall</a>. The area is also known as the <a>Fenway Cultural District</a>.</p>
<p>The Snell Library is also home to the Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections department, which includes the <a>Benjamin LaGuer</a> papers collection. The Special Collections focus on records of Boston-area community-based organizations that are concerned with social justice issues.</p>
<h3>Spiritual Life Center and Sacred Space</h3>
<p>Within the crowded, busy urban environment that characterizes the campus as a whole, NU has carved out a quiet, peaceful space in the centrally-located Ell Building for the Spiritual Life Center's Sacred Space.   The Sacred Space is the Center's main assembly hall.  It is nondenominational and can be configured with carpets, mats or chairs to accommodate different ritual needs. It has a distinctive ceiling consisting of 3 hanging domes made of overlapping aluminum tiles with an origami-like effect, warm wood floors and accents, and glass-panelled walls that lean outward slightly, their shape and material giving a sense of openness and volume to the space.  Faucets for ablution are available in a flanking antechamber, and the Center also contains a smaller meeting space and library. The Sacred Space opened in 1998.  The architects Office dA (Nader Tehrani &amp; Monica Ponce de Leon)  received the 2002 <a>Harleston Parker Medal</a> from the Boston Society of Architects for the design.</p>

<p>The plans for Building K, a 22-story high rise housing 600 beds, have been suspended indefinitely as a result of the troubled economy.</p>
<h3>South Campus (Columbus Avenue)</h3>
<p>Northeastern University's southernmost section of campus is located along Columbus Avenue in Roxbury, parallel to the <a>Orange line</a>. The University expanded south into Roxbury at the same time as they were building West Village. In 2001, Davenport Commons was opened, providing 585 students housing in two new, state-of-the-art residence halls while 75 families representing a range of incomes have been able to purchase a condo or townhouse at or below Boston&#x2019;s market value. Davenport Commons also created more than  of commercial space on Tremont Street and has received an enthusiastic response from city residents, students and its occupants.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2006, Northeastern University proposed a new residence hall further away from the main campus at the corner of Tremont Street and Ruggles Street. The building was approved by the city in January 2007. Construction on the building, which is located on land known as Parcel-18, began in late February 2007. The building opened as expected in Fall of 2009 and has a total of 22 stories. In the Spring of 2009, The complex was named International Village and opened later that Summer. Its nicknames include &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;INV.&quot; It consists of two residence halls, an office complex and an administration building and a gym. The residence halls house honors level freshman and all levels of upperclassmen. A 400 seat capacity dining hall is available to all members of the Northeastern community as well as the public. <a>Peets Coffee</a> and <a>Jamba Juice</a> occupy retail locations on the ground floor.</p>

<h3>Dodge Hall</h3>
<p>Dodge Hall is mainly used for Northeastern's business programs (Before Snell Library opened in 1990, Dodge Hall served as the university's main library). Dodge Hall has five floors. The basement houses a computer lab and is connected to the university's large network of underground tunnels, which connects many buildings.</p>
<p>Classrooms and a lounge area occupy the first floor. The Undergraduate School of Business Administration office is on the second floor. The Graduate School of Business Administration  office is on the third floor. The School of Professional Accounting office is on the fourth floor.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the campus&#x2019; environmental impact, Northeastern has formed a Sustainability Committee that meets several times a year to create proposals to the President&#x2019;s Office.</pre>
<p>A subcommittee of the Sustainability Committee meets monthly to discuss the ways in which facilities, energy efficiency and management initiatives, landscaping practices and procedures, and cost-savings efforts may be greened and makes recommendations to the larger Sustainability Committee. The 22-story residence Hall (International Village) will be the campus&#x2019; second LEED certified building, with the renovation of Dockser Hall being the first building on campus to achieve LEED certification. The Clean Plates initiative, which encourages students to separate their leftover food in dining halls, has allowed dining services to compost seven to eight tons per week.  Due to these initiatives, Northeastern was awarded an overall grade of &#x201c;B&#x201d; on the Sustainable Endowments Institute&#x2019;s College Sustainability Report Card 2009.</pre>
<p>In addition, in 2010 the <a>Princeton Review</a> rated Northeastern as one of the top 15 &quot;Green Colleges&quot; in the nation. </p>
<h3>Public safety</h3>
<p><a>right|350px|thumb|Northeastern Police Department Cruiser</a> The Northeastern University Police Department is a full service law enforcement agency with full powers of arrest on university property or property used by Northeastern students and faculty. The campus is adjacent to the <a>Boston Police Department</a>'s Headquarters. A 2008 Reader's Digest survey ranked NU as the second safest school in the United States after Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.</p>
<h3>Public transportation</h3>
<p>Boston's public transportation system (<a>MBTA</a>) runs through the Northeastern campus. The <a>Green Line</a> T stop (<a>Northeastern</a>) is in front of the Marino Center, running through campus along Huntington Ave. The <a>Orange Line</a> T stop (<a>Ruggles</a>) is behind Snell Library. The Ruggles T stop also connects to commuter rail trains, allowing travel outside the city of Boston. Other &quot;T&quot; stops are closer to further outlying areas of the growing campus, such as the Green Line's <a>Museum of Fine Arts MFA</a>] stop being closest to the West Village residences, and the <a>Symphony</a> stop, also on the Green Line, being closest to Matthews Arena. The <a>Mass Ave.</a> stop on the Orange Line is also near Matthews, as well as being equidistant from the main buildings in the South Campus.  The <a>Hynes Convention Center</a> stop (part of the Green Line subway) is also a short walk away, which provides quicker access to either the <a>B</a>, <a>C</a> or <a>D</a> Green Line branches, as opposed to taking the <a>E</a> line inbound then switching at <a>Arlington</a> or <a>Copley</a>.</p>
<h3>Campus development background</h3>
<p>Northeastern's campus is mostly located along Huntington Avenue in an area known as the &quot;<a>Fenway Cultural District</a>&quot; which is part of Boston's <a>Fenway</a> and <a>Back Bay</a> neighborhoods. Other notable institutions in the district include: the <a>Museum of Fine Arts</a>, <a>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</a>, <a>Symphony Hall</a>, the <a>Huntington Theater</a>, <a>New England Conservatory</a>, <a>Boston Conservatory</a>, <a>Berklee College of Music</a>, <a>Christian Science Center</a>, <a>Mary Baker Eddy Library</a> and <a>Harvard School of Public Health</a>.</p>
<p>Northeastern's campus is something of an urban oddity; despite its location in central Boston, Northeastern is home to a remarkable amount of green open space and quads.</p>
<p>A site master planning competition awarded a multi-million dollar contract to revive and rejuvenate the campus and the process was started in 1988 with the creation of the new Northeastern Quad and Mt Ryder. A small oval of land centrally located at the campus main entrance was refurbished by the donations of the graduating class of 1989.</p>
<p>What was once a concrete square, outside of the library and student center, was transformed with brick pavers and granite curb stones, in a scalloped design that would eliminate all square corners, a concept developed by the outgoing class of 1989 in a &#x201c;Northeastern News&#x201d; poll and suggestion to the President Box that was presented to the board of Trustees in March 1988.  The &#x201c;No Corners&#x201d; campaign kicked off with a fund raiser at the Ell Student Center on Parents weekend in October 1988.  The later selection of a nationally recognized green space landscape architect in 1990 started a renewal plan that continues today.  Since the late 1990s Northeastern has been considered a model of design for an urban university and has been twice won the &#x201c;most beautiful new or renovated exterior space&#x201d; award presented by the American Institute of Architects in 2001 and again in 2004.  In 2008, West Village Building F was recognized in American Institute of Architects New England 2008 Merit Awards for Design Excellence.</p>
<p>In 2003, Northeastern was awarded the prestigious gold medal by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. A unique feature of the University is its well-traveled network of underground <a>tunnel</a>s that link 13 major campus buildings for easier travel during <a>inclement weather</a>. However, due to city regulations preventing expansion of the tunnels under major city streets and underground rivers under the campus, the tunnels primarily service the buildings on the university's early campus space (i.e., buildings developed during the 1980s through the present are not served by the tunnel system).</p>
<h2>Student life and activities</h2>
<p> Northeastern has over 19 varsity teams in the NCAA, over 30 club sport teams, and over 200 student organizations.  Several prominent student-run organizations, including the Resident Student Association (RSA), Student Government Association (SGA), Northeastern University Television (NUTV), Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL), and the Council for University Programs (CUP) organize activities for Northeastern students as well as the surrounding community.</p>

<h2>Northeastern University in popular culture</h2>
<p>The 1957 story <a>Galley Slave</a>, by <a>Isaac Asimov</a>, takes place at Northeastern University in 2033.  Involving a <a>robot</a> that is essentially a <a>word processor</a>, it is included in <a>The Complete Robot</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1989 film, <em><a>Field of Dreams</a></em>, Ray Kinsella (played by <a>Kevin Costner</a>) drives down Huntington Avenue in his search for Terence 'Terry' Mann (played by <a>James Earl Jones</a>). Several Northeastern University buildings are visible, including Burstein Hall and Rubenstein Hall.</p>
<p>In the November 1, 1996 broadcast of <em><a>The Late Show with David Letterman</a></em>, Mr. Letterman is seen in a racing shell with the Northeastern University Mens Crew team on the Charles River.</p>
<p>In the sixth season of the sitcom, <em><a>Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em>, episode 11, Raymond's father (played by <a>Peter Boyle</a>) holds for ransom a game-winning football from a Hofstra-Northeastern match.  Ironically, both schools dropped their football programs at the end of the 2009 season.</p>
<p>In the 2003 remake of the movie, <em><a>The Italian Job</a></em>, Lyle (played by <a>Seth Green</a>), is revealed to be a Northeastern University alumnus who claims to be the original inventor of music file sharing program <a>Napster</a>. <a>Shawn Fanning</a> makes a brief appearance in the film and plays the role of himself.</p>
<p>In the 2006, <a>Martin Scorsese</a> film, <em><a>The Departed</a></em>, several Northeastern Maddog alumni appeared in the rugby scene in the film with <a>Matt Damon</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2006 <a>CBS</a> reality television show, <em><a>Survivor: Panama&#x2014;Exile Island</a></em>, a Northeastern graduate, <a>Danielle DiLorenzo</a>, finished in second place.</p>
<p>An article in <em><a>WIRED</a></em> magazine issue April 2008, &quot;Eureka! Epic Moments in Tech&quot;, a portrait on great technological achievements, shows a picture of Kennedy Hall, Northeastern University and an explanation of the founding of Napster, a peer-to-peer file sharing network founded by Shawn Fanning, a former student at Northeastern University.</p>
<p>In the October 20, 2008 episode of <em><a>The Daily Show</a></em>, <a>Jon Stewart</a> makes a shout out to Northeastern and comments how their hockey team beat the defending champions <a>Boston College</a>.  This was after his stand up act on campus the previous week.</p>
<p>During the <a>2010 special election</a> for a Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat, the <em>Boston Globe</em> announced President <a>Barack Obama</a> would make a public campaign appearance at Northeastern University for Democratic senate candidate and current Massachusetts' Attorney General <a>Martha Coakley</a> on Sunday, January 17, 2010.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> [[Image:NUtwocolorNlogo.PNG|thumb|right|[[Northeastern Huskies]] logo]] Some notable athletes have played for Northeastern's sports teams. <a>Dan Ross</a> played football at Northeastern long before setting the Super Bowl record for receptions in a game.  <a>Reggie Lewis</a> still holds the men's basketball career scoring record. <a>Carlos Pena</a> was named Major League Baseball's American League Comeback Player of the Year in 2007 and an AL Gold Glove winner in 2008. The U.S. Olympic women's ice hockey teams have included Northeastern alumni <a>Shelley Looney</a> and <a>Chanda Gunn</a>. The NU mascot is <a>Paws</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the Northeastern University athletic teams compete in the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a>; the school switched from the <a>America East Conference</a> to the CAA for the 2005-06 athletic season.  In 2007, its second year in the CAA, the women's track team captured the conference championship, while the volleyball team finished second in the conference.</p>
<p>In its first year in the league, the men's basketball team finished in 6th place (out of 12 teams) and advanced to the semifinals of the conference tournament. The CAA proved to be a competitive conference in the 2006 <a>NCAA Basketball Tournament</a>, as <a>George Mason University</a> advanced all the way to the <a>Final Four</a>. The women's basketball team won 10 more games in 2008 than in the previous year, representing the biggest one-year turnaround in the CAA, and advanced to the tournament quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Northeastern's men's and women's hockey teams compete in the <a>Hockey East</a> Conference. During the 2007-08 season, the men's team ranked as high at #7 in the country and held the top spot in the conference before finishing the season in sixth place in Hockey East. Both teams also participate in the annual <a>Beanpot</a> tournament between the four major Boston-area colleges. Northeastern's men's team has won the annual event 4 times in its 54-year history, while the women's team has captured the Beanpot 14 times. During the 2008-2009 season, the men's team ranked as high as 3rd in the nation and held the top spot in Hockey East until the last weekend of the season. Northeastern also made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1994, the Beanpot championship game for the first time since 2004, and goalie Brad Thiessen made the Hobey Hat Trick, only the second Northeastern player to do so.</p>
<p>The Northeastern Crew team consistently ranks as one of the top 10 teams in the nation. In the 2008 National Championship, the team made the Grand Finals and placed fourth behind <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</a>, <a>University of Washington</a>, and <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, while beating <a>Brown University</a>, <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> and <a>Harvard University</a>.</p>
<p>Northeastern offers 40 club sports, including <a>judo</a>, <a>rugby</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>squash</a>, <a>cycling</a> and <a>ultimate frisbee</a>. The women's rugby team finished third in the nation in Division II in 2005. The men's lacrosse team began the 2008 season ranked in the Top 10 nationally.  The men's and women's squash team finished the 2008 season ranked in the Top 20 nationally. In the 2008-2009 academic year the Northeastern Club Field Hockey and Women's Basketball teams won their respective National Championships. From 2007 to 2009, the Northeastern Club Baseball team won three straight New England Club Baseball Association championships. On May 25, 2010 the club baseball team defeated Penn State to win the National Club Baseball Association Division II World Series and national championship.</p>
<p>Citing sparse attendance, numerous losing seasons and the expense to renovate Parsons Field to an acceptable standard, the university Board of Trustees voted on November 20, 2009, to end the <a>football</a> program. According to president Joseph Aoun, &quot;Leadership requires that we make these choices. This decision allows us to focus on our existing athletic programs.&quot;</p>
