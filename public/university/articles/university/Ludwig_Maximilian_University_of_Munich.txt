<p>The <strong>Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</strong> (), commonly known as the <strong>University of Munich</strong> or <strong>LMU</strong>, is a <a>university</a> in <a>Munich</a>, <a>Germany</a>. A <a>public</a> <a>research university</a>, it is amongst <a>Germany's oldest universities</a>.</p>
<p>Originally established in <a>Ingolstadt</a> in 1472 by <a>Duke Ludwig XI of Bavaria-Landshut</a>, the university was moved in 1800 to <a>Landshut</a> by <a>King Maximilian I of Bavaria</a> when Ingolstadt was threatened by the French, before being relocated to its present-day location in Munich in 1826 by <a>King Ludwig I of Bavaria</a>. In 1802, the university was officially named <em>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&#x00e4;t</em> by King Maximilian I of Bavaria in his as well as the university's original founder's honour.</p>
<p>The University of Munich has, particularly since the 19th century, been considered as one of Germany's as well as Europe's most prestigious universities; with <a>34 Nobel laureates</a> associated with the university, it ranks 13th worldwide in terms of Nobel laureates. Among these were <a>Wilhelm R&#x00f6;ntgen</a>, <a>Max Planck</a>,&#x00a0;<a>Werner Heisenberg</a>, <a>Otto Hahn</a> and <a>Thomas Mann</a>. <a>Pope Benedict XVI</a> was also a student and professor at the university. The LMU has recently been conferred the title of &quot;elite university&quot; under the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>The LMU is currently the second-largest university in <a>Germany</a> in terms of student population; in the winter semester of 2009/2010, the university had a total of 45,539 matriculated students. Of these, 7,801 were freshmen while international students totalled 6,743 or almost 15% of the student population. As for endowments, the university records in 2008 a total of 458.8 million Euros in funding without the university hospital; with the university hospital, the university has a total funding amounting to approximately 1 billion Euros.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The university was founded with papal approval in 1472 as the <a>University of Ingolstadt</a> (foundation right of <a>Louis IX the Rich</a>), with faculties of philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence and theology. Its first rector was <a>Christopher Mendel of Steinfels</a>, who later became <a>bishop of Chiemsee</a>.</p>
<p>In the period of <a>German humanism</a>, the university's academics included names such as <a>Conrad Celtes</a> and <a>Petrus Apianus</a>. The theologian <a>Johann Eck</a> also taught at the university. From 1549 to 1773, the university was influenced by the <a>Jesuits</a> and became one of the centres of the <a>Counter-Reformation</a>. The Jesuit <a>Petrus Canisius</a> served as rector of the university.</p>
<p>At the end of the 18th century, the university was influenced by the <a>Enlightenment</a>, which led to a stronger emphasis on <a>natural science</a>.</p>
<p>In 1800, the Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph (the later <a>Maximilian I, King</a> of <a>Bavaria</a>) moved the university to <a>Landshut</a>, due to French aggression that threatened Ingolstadt during the <a>Napoleonic Wars</a>. In 1802, the university was renamed the Ludwig Maximilian University in honour of its two founders, <a>Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria</a> and <a>Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria</a>. The Minister of Education, <a>Maximilian von Montgelas</a>, initiated a number of reforms that sought to modernize the rather conservative and Jesuit-influenced university. In 1826, it was moved to <a>Munich</a>, the capital of the <a>Kingdom of Bavaria</a>. The university was situated in the <a>Old Academy</a> until a new building in the <a>Ludwigstra&#x00df;e</a> was completed.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19th century, the university rose to great prominence in the European scientific community, attracting many of the world's leading scientists. It was also a period of great expansion. From 1903, women were allowed to study at Bavarian universities, and by 1918, the female proportion of students at LMU had reached 18 %. In 1918, <a>Adele Hartmann</a> became the first woman in Germany to earn the <a>Habilitation</a> (higher doctorate), at LMU.</p>
<p>During the <a>Weimar Republic</a>, the university continued to be one of the world's leading universities, with professors such as <a>Wilhelm R&#x00f6;ntgen</a>, <a>Wilhelm Wien</a>, <a>Richard Willst&#x00e4;tter</a>, <a>Arnold Sommerfeld</a> and <a>Ferdinand Sauerbruch</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a>period of national socialist rule</a>, academic freedom was severely curtailed. In 1943 the <a>White Rose</a> group of anti-Nazi students conducted their campaign of opposition to the national socialists at this university.</p>
<p>The university has continued to be one the leading universities of <a>West Germany</a> during the <a>Cold War</a> and in the post-reunification era. In the late 1960s, the university was the scene of protests by radical students.</p>
<p>Today the University of Munich is part of 24 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 13 of them. It also hosts 12 DFG Research Training Groups and three international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria. It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives.</p>
<p>LMU Munich has a wide range of degree programs, with 150 subjects available in numerous combinations. 15% of the 45,000 students who attend the university come from abroad.</p>
<p>In 2005, Germany&#x2019;s state and federal governments launched the <a>Excellence Initiative</a>, a contest among its universities. With a total of 1.9 billion euros, 75 percent of which comes from the federal state, its architects aim to strategically promote top-level research and <a>scholarship</a>. The money is given to more than 30 research universities in Germany.</p>
<p>The initiative will fund three project-oriented areas: <a>Graduate school</a>s to promote the next generation of scholars, clusters of excellence to promote cutting-edge research and &#x201c;future concepts&#x201d; for the project-based expansion of academic excellence at universities as a whole. In order to qualify for this third area, a university had to have at least one internationally recognized academic <a>center of excellence</a> and a new graduate school.</p>
<p>After the first round of selections, LMU Munich was invited to submit applications for all three funding lines: It entered the competition with proposals for two graduate schools and four clusters of excellence.</p>
<p>On Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education. The panel, composed of the <a>German Research Foundation</a> and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one <a>Graduate school</a>, three &#x201c;excellence clusters&#x201d; and general funding for the university&#x2019;s &#x201c;future concept&#x201d;.</p>
<h2>University buildings</h2>
<p>LMU's institutes and research centers are spread throughout Munich, with several buildings located in the suburbs of <a>Oberschleissheim</a> and <a>Garching</a> as well as <a>Maisach</a> and <a>Bad T&#x00f6;lz</a>. The university's main buildings are grouped around Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and Professor-Huber-Platz on <a>Ludwigstrasse</a>, extending into side streets such as Akademiestra&#x00df;e, Schellingstra&#x00df;e, and Veterin&#x00e4;rstra&#x00df;e. Other large campuses and institutes are located in <a>Gro&#x00df;hadern</a> (<a>Klinikum Gro&#x00df;hadern</a>), <a>Martinsried</a> (chemistry and biotechnology campus), the <a>Ludwigsvorstadt</a> (<a>Klinikum Innenstadt</a>) and in the <a>Lehel</a> (<a>Institut am Englischen Garten</a>), across from the main buildings, through the <a>Englischer Garten</a>.</p>

<h2>Academic Organisation</h2>
<h3>Subjects &amp; Fields of Study</h3>
<p>Despite the <a>Bologna Process</a> which saw the demise of most traditional academic degree courses such as the <em><a>Diplom</a></em> and <em><a>Magister Artium</a></em> in favour of the more internationally-known <a>Bachelors</a> and <a>Masters</a> system, the University of Munich continues to offer more than 100 areas of study with numerous combinations of majors and minors.</p>
<p>In line with the university's internationalisation as a popular destination for tertiary studies, an increasing number of courses mainly at the graduate and post-graduate levels are being taught in English to cater to international students who may have little or no background of the German language. Some notable subject areas which currently offer programmes in English include various fields of <a>psychology</a>, <a>physics</a> as well as <a>business</a> and <a>management</a>.

<h3>Fees</h3>
<h4>Tuition Fees</h4>
<p>After the <a>German Constitutional Court</a> overturned a federal law prohibiting tuition fees and devolved the right to administrate tuition fees to the state level, the university's Senate decided upon the introduction of tuition fees in the Summer Semester of 2006. Tuition fees were initially capped at &#x20ac;300 in the Summer Semester of 2007 and Winter Semester of 2007/2008, but were reviewed in the Winter Semester of 2008/2009 to introduce a &#x20ac;42 <em>Grundbeitrag</em> or basic contribution fee to the state-run <em><a>Studentenwerk</a></em> as well as a &#x20ac;50 administrative fee (<em>Verwaltungsgeb&#x00fc;hr</em>); the <em>Verwaltungsgeb&#x00fc;hr</em> was however subsequently abolished by the <a>Bavarian state government</a>.</p>
<p>The total tuition fees administered by the university currently stands at &#x20ac;542.</p>
<h4>Semesterticket</h4>
<p>Despite being home to a large student population as well as being one of the most expensive German cities to live in, Munich stands out as being one of the few German cities which currently does not offer a semester transportation pass (generally known as a <em>Semesterticket</em>) to students. Because of this, students in Munich currently have to separately apply for the <a>Munich Transport and Tariff Association</a>'s (MVV) monthly subscription which comes at a significantly higher price as opposed to what a <em>Semesterticket</em> would in other German cities.</p>
<p>In 2009, the MVV offered a package which would introduce a <em>Semesterticket</em> at a basic fee of &#x20ac;78.50 with a premium surchage of &#x20ac;143.50, totalling &#x20ac;222; this proposition narrowly fell through after voting was conducted across all the Munich universities as it was still deemed to be too pricey in comparison to the <em>Semesterickets</em> offered by other German cities, with students of the LMU Munich voting 52.1% against and 47.9% in favour. Negotiations between the MVV and representatives of the Munich student unions are currently still underway.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p>LMU Munich is consistently ranked among the world's top 100 universities in various international ranking surveys such as the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> and the <a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a> which ranks over 1000 universities worldwide. In  a 2010 human competitiveness index &amp; analysis <a>Human Resources &amp; Labor Review</a> published in Chasecareer Network, LMU Munich was the only German university listed in its list of the world's best 50 universities and was ranked 38th internationally.</p>
