<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>In 1886, the Milwaukee State Normal School opened for classes at 18th and Wells in downtown Milwaukee. Over the next 42 years, the Milwaukee State Normal School saw 7 different presidents, the addition of <a>music</a> and <a>liberal arts</a> programs and rapid growth from an initial enrollment of 76. In 1919, the Milwaukee State Normal School moved from downtown to the current location near the lakefront when a new building, now Mitchell Hall, was completed. In 1937, the Milwaukee State Normal School changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teacher&#x2019;s College in an effort by the State Normal School Regents to refocus on the instruction of teachers. The college became one of the nation's top teacher's training colleges in the 1940s.  In 1953, the Legislature empowered all state colleges to offer liberal arts programs. The Wisconsin State Teacher&#x2019;s College consequently became <a>Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee</a>, which became part of the <a>then University of Wisconsin</a> 5 years later.</p>
<h3>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee</h3>
<p>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee was founded with the belief that <a>Milwaukee</a> needed a great public university to become a great city. In 1955, the Wisconsin state legislature passed a bill to create a large public university that offered graduate programs in Wisconsin's largest city; the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee was established in 1956, as a result of the merger of the Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee (WSCM) and University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee extension, a UW branch that had been offering graduate degrees in Milwaukee. The new university consisted of the WSCM campus near the lakefront and the University of Wisconsin extension at downtown Milwaukee. The first commencement of the new University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee was held on June 16, 1957. On June 13, 1958, <a>Socialist</a> mayor <a>Frank P. Zeidler</a> was the first person to receive an honorary doctorate from the university. From 1956-1971, this new school, the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison and the latter's affiliated 10 <a>freshman-sophomore centers</a> and state-wide <a>extensions</a>. were part of <a>a merged system under separate governance</a>. In 1971, the state legislature merged this entity with the <a>Wisconsin State Universities</a> to form a united <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> under a single board of regents.In 1988, <a>UW System</a> designated eight Centers of Excellence at UWM. In 1994, UWM was designated as a Research II University (now a Doctoral/Research University-Extensive) by the Carnegie Foundation.</p>
<p><a>thumb|280px|Merrill Hall</a> In the 50 years since adding the Milwaukee campus to the UW System, UWM has expanded to 12 schools and colleges and now offers 84 <a>undergraduate</a> programs, 48 <a>graduate</a> programs and 22 <a>doctoral</a> degrees, with a university-wide focus on academic research, teaching and community service. In 2005, <a>UW&#x2013;Milwaukee</a> surpassed <a>UW&#x2013;Madison</a> in the number of Wisconsin resident students and became the university with the largest enrollment of Wisconsin residents.</p>
<p>In 2006, UW&#x2013;Milwaukee was ranked as the ninth best &#x201c;Saviors of Our Cities&#x201d; by the <a>New England Board of Higher Education</a> (NEBHE), because of its strong positive contribution of careful strategic planning and thoughtful use of resources that have dramatically strengthened the economy and quality of life of <a>Milwaukee</a>, and was voted by the public as one of the top ten &quot;Gems of Milwaukee&quot; .</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:UWM-0904-greenemuseum.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Thomas A. Greene Memorial Museum]]]] The  UWM campus is located in a residential area on <a>Milwaukee</a>&#x2019;s upper <a>East Side</a>. The campus is five blocks from the shoreline of <a>Lake Michigan</a>, and is less than a ten-minute drive from downtown Milwaukee. The Milwaukee County Transit System provides the campus with access to public bus transportation in Milwaukee.  The campus is shaped like an &quot;L,&quot; and is divided into central, west and north quads.  In addition to the campus proper, UWM incorporates a large number of other sites throughout the Milwaukee metropolitan area.</p>
