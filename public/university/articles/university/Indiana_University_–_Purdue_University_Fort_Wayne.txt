<p> </p>
<p><strong>Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Fort Wayne</strong> is the largest university in northeast Indiana, offering more than 200 <a>IU</a> and <a>Purdue</a> degrees and certificates. Since 1968, IPFW has conferred nearly 8,800 master&#x2019;s degrees, 27,000 bachelor&#x2019;s degrees, more than 20,000 associate degrees, and nearly 2,000 certificates. There are more than 46,000 alumni.</p>
<p>During the 2010&#x2013;11 academic year, more than 14,000 students of diverse ages, races, and nationalities pursued their education on the  campus. More than 9,000 students attended full time. Students have arrived from 43 states and 68 countries. And more than 13 percent of the student body reflects African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic heritage. The campus has nearly 400 full-time faculty members, with approximately 70 professors, 115 associate processors, and approximately 130 assistant professors. It also has more than 60 instructors and lecturers and about 400 associate faculty. More than 80 percent of the full-time faculty earned the highest degree in their respective field.[1]</p>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>IPFW is governed in various ways via the <a>Purdue University</a> Board of Trustees, the <a>Indiana University</a> Board of Trustees, and the IPFW Faculty Senate. <a>Purdue</a> serves as the fiscal agent for IPFW&#x2019;s budget and substantially represents IPFW during budgetary negotiations with the State of Indiana. The Indiana-Purdue Foundation owns most of the land that constitutes IPFW and has entered into a 99-year lease with the county for additional land for $1. The IPFW Faculty Senate represents the faculty in the university&#x2019;s shared governance model. The desire was so strong for an expansion of IPFW during the 1980s that the Faculty Senate and Indiana-Purdue Foundation explored the full independence from both <a>Purdue</a> and <a>IU</a>, not entirely unlike the <a>University of Southern Indiana</a>&#x2019;s independence from <a>Indiana State University</a> in 1985. Since then, relations with <a>Purdue</a> have improved, as has the level of funding from the <a>State of Indiana</a>. Any moves toward independence now are largely a matter for history, as the current path of cooperative autonomy is pursued. [2]</p>
<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>Either <a>Purdue</a> or <a>IU</a> awards IPFW&#x2019;s degrees on a program-by-program basis. IPFW&#x2019;s colleges, schools, and divisions are not each identified specifically as <a>IU</a> units or as <a>Purdue</a> units. Through an agreement between the <a>IU</a> and <a>Purdue</a> trustees, most of IPFW&#x2019;s university services are administratively operated through <a>Purdue</a>&#x2019;s processes. This is in contrast to IPFW&#x2019;s sibling university, Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Indianapolis, where <a>IUPUI</a> is a core campus of the <a>Indiana University System</a>, where <a>IUPUI</a>&#x2019;s university services are administratively operated through the <a>Indiana University System</a>, and where <a>IUPUI</a>&#x2019;s schools and academic divisions are each strongly identified by name as <a>IU</a> or <a>Purdue</a> aligned. Some students fulfill their freshman, sophomore, or even junior courses at IPFW before transferring to the main campuses in Bloomington or West Lafayette to complete their degrees in majors not offered at the regional campus. For instance, aeronautical and astronautical engineering is not an offering at IPFW, but many mechanical engineering courses apply through the sophomore year. </p>

Also, <a>NCATE</a> has accredited IPFW&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s degrees in education [4].</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> In 1917, <a>Indiana University</a> started offering courses in downtown Fort Wayne to 142 students in 12 courses. At a separate downtown location, <a>Purdue University</a> permanently established the <a>Purdue University</a> Center in 1941 to provide a site in Fort Wayne for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degree [5].</p>
<p>Under the direction of <a>Purdue University</a> President <a>Frederick Hovde</a>, <a>Indiana University</a> President <a>Herman Wells</a>, IU trustee John Hastings, and Purdue trustee Alfred Kettler Sr., the <a>Indiana University</a> and <a>Purdue University</a> extension centers began merging in 1958 via the formation of the Indiana-Purdue Foundation. To serve the extension centers&#x2019; now combined mission in Fort Wayne, the Indiana-Purdue Foundation acquired a 99-year lease on existing farmland owned by Allen County&#x2014;the <a>Indiana</a> county containing Fort Wayne&#x2014;and land used by the Fort Wayne State School, to form a total of  at the then-suburban northeast edge of Fort Wayne on the eastern bank of the <a>St. Joseph River</a>. Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Fort Wayne opened on September 17, 1964, following nearly two years of construction that began on October 18, 1962. The first all-inclusive building on campus was known as the Education Building, but it has since been renamed Kettler Hall in honor of the combined university&#x2019;s chief advocate. Kettler&#x2019;s vision and passion during the 1950s made IPFW possible. IPFW awarded its first four-year degree in 1968 after awarding two-year degrees through the <a>IU</a> and <a>Purdue</a> Fort Wayne extension centers prior to the formation of the joint IPFW campus [5].</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|250px|thumb|The groundbreaking for IPFW&#x2014;which represented a first-of-its-kind merging in the country between two independent universities&#x2014;took place in 1963.|||</a> --&gt; In the spirit of <a>Indiana University</a>&#x2019;s 1967 acquisition of the <a>Herron School of Art</a> in Indianapolis, which helped form <a>IUPUI</a> two years later, the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a> approved a similar merger of the Fort Wayne Art Institute with IPFW in 1976. The Fort Wayne Art Institute was founded in 1897 as the Fort Wayne Art School. Until 1991 the Fort Wayne Art Institute and resulting academic unit within IPFW maintained a small campus in downtown Fort Wayne. In 1998 this academic unit was renamed the School of Fine and Performing Arts. During the latter 1990s, the School of Fine and Performing Arts and its primary classroom building was renamed the School of Visual and Performing Arts and Visual and Performing Arts Building, respectively. In the mid-2000s, the <a>Purdue University</a> board of trustees granted the school &#x201c;college&#x201d; status, and it became the College of Visual and Performing Arts. In 1988, a coalition of the then-<a>Lincoln National Corporation</a> under the direction of Ian Rolland, the M.E. Raker Foundation, the Olive B. Cole Foundation, and the Foellinger Foundation purchased an additional  on the west bank of the <a>St. Joseph River</a>. This tract was the remaining portion of the McKay family homestead [6]. </p>
<p>In 2007, the <a>State of Indiana</a> completed the process of closing the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center. A portion of the grounds had been transferred to IPFW years earlier for construction of the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center. The remaining property and buildings of the  developmental center was transferred later in 2007, with the land split between IPFW (40 acres) and <a>Ivy Tech Community College</a>&#x2013;Northeast (45 acres) [6]. </p>
<h3>Chancellors</h3>
<p>At the separate <a>Indiana University</a> and <a>Purdue University</a> extension centers, the most senior executive title was &#x201c;dean and director.&#x201d; Frank Schockley (1917), Floyd Neff (1917&#x2013;1951), and Ralph Broyles (1951&#x2013;1970) were the dean-directors at the <a>IU</a> Fort Wayne Extension Center. Broyles then served as the only chancellor of the <a>IU</a> regional campus from 1970 to 1974. Conwell Poling (1942&#x2013;1947), Richard Bateman (1947&#x2013;1960), Robert Ewigleben (1960&#x2013;1965), D. Richard Smith (1965&#x2013;1970), Lawrence Nelson (1970, interim), and Roger Manges (1970&#x2013;1975) comprised the sequence of dean-directors at the <a>Purdue University</a> Fort Wayne Extension Center. </p>
<p>Under Dean-Directors Neff and Broyles, the <a>IU</a> Extension Center expanded into an institution that granted associate degrees and presaged what was to come. Under Broyles&#x2019; leadership coupled with Alfred Kettler&#x2019;s vision for a physically combined IPFW, the IPFW site became a reality in the 1960s. Kettler Hall (then the Education Building), Neff Hall, Helmke Library, and the Walb Student Union were built during this phase and into the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Through an agreement between <a>Purdue University</a> and <a>IU</a> that took effect June 1974, the schools dissolved the regional campus administrations and approved administrative reorganization at all of the regional campuses in the state. Donald Schwartz was named the single chancellor of all of IPFW in July 1974 [6]. Schwartz (1974&#x2013;1978), Francis Borkowski (summer 1978, acting), Dwight Henderson (1978&#x2013;1979, acting), Joseph Giusti (1979&#x2013;1984), Edward Nicholson Jr. (1984&#x2013;1986, acting), Thomas Wallace (1986&#x2013;1988), Joanne Lantz (1988&#x2013;1994), and Michael A. Wartell (1994&#x2013;present) have all led IPFW as the chancellor [5]. This sequence of leadership can be segmented into five major administrations in IPFW&#x2019;s history and progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Schwartz Administration</strong> (1974&#x2013;1978)&#x2014;An immediate goal for Donald Schwartz was to unify the administrative offices, campus policies, and 32 academic departments between <a>IU</a> and <a>Purdue</a> programs [6]. To support the new institution&#x2019;s image as a self-contained campus, what had been known as the <a>Indiana</a>-<a>Purdue</a> Regional Campus at Fort Wayne became <a>Indiana University</a>&#x2013;<a>Purdue University</a> at Fort Wayne. (The &#x201c;at&#x201d; was dropped in subsequent years.) As his tenure progressed, Schwartz continually challenged both <a>IU</a>&#x2019;s and <a>Purdue</a>&#x2019;s president to gain greater autonomy for the Fort Wayne campus. While this passion established greater local decision-making authority, the style and speed associated with these changes were not well received in Bloomington and West Lafayette. These reservations expressed by the respective presidents inspired Schwartz to resign from his post in early 1978 [6]. </li>
  <li><strong>The Giusti Administration</strong> (1979&#x2013;1984)&#x2014;Giusti&#x2019;s administration continued the emphasis on unifying the operations of IPFW as a university serving northeast Indiana. Community relations were strengthened through the chancellor&#x2019;s membership on numerous boards and his encouragement to faculty and staff to find ways to build town-gown relationships. Giusti also led efforts to beautify the campus, including the establishment of the Geogarden, the Friends Carrilon, the Neff Hall sculpture, and the Distinguished Alumni Room. The Medical-Education Building and the Gates Sports Center were constructed during his administration. In turn, the Fort Wayne Center for Medical Education was formed, and IPFW&#x2019;s athletics programs moved to <a>NCAA</a> Division II and membership in the <a>Great Lakes Valley Conference</a>. Academic programs were established, including anthropology and engineering, and the Weekend College was inaugurated. The faculty governance structure reached a new level of maturity with the establishment of the joint faculty senate. Several <a>IU</a> technology programs were integrated with on-campus programs, and the downtown Barr Street facility was leased to a local nonprofit organization. The affirmative action office was established, major efforts were made to improve campus publications and communication strategies, and the IPFW cable TV station was launched. Enrollment surpassed the 10,000-student milestone [5].</li>
  <li><strong>The Wallace Administration</strong> (1986&#x2013;1988)&#x2014;The arrival of Thomas Wallace was a burst of energy for IPFW. It began a densely condensed phase of history that defined a refreshed and re-energized vision for IPFW, which included the academic structure of its schools, the school colors, adjustments to the relationship with the parent university systems, and the current building-construction phase. Wallace left IPFW upon being selected as president of <a>Illinois State University</a> in June 1988, where he executed a substantially similar vision as to what he had developed at IPFW. By the close of the Wallace administration, the major accomplishment was the re-establishment of blue and white as IPFW&#x2019;s official school colors, which is a notable act of autonomy because IPFW is the only member of either the <a>Purdue</a> system or the <a>IU</a> system to have neither red nor crimson nor gold nor old gold as one of its school colors [6]. The major accomplishments of the Wallace administration that were finalized shortly after Wallace&#x2019;s departure were the reorganization of IPFW&#x2019;s disparate collection of departments and divisions into a cohesive set of schools and the establishment of an MBA degree. </li>
  <li><strong>The Lantz Administration</strong> (1988&#x2013;1994)&#x2014;The fourth phase was a period of renewing strong relationships with the parent university systems through Chancellor Lantz&#x2019;s efforts. Following the energetic two years of the Wallace administration, <a>Purdue</a> was interested in establishing both a better relationship with IPFW as well as a firmer control over IPFW. Lantz negotiated a four-way agreement between <a>Purdue</a>, the <a>IU</a> system, the IPFW faculty, and the <a>Indiana</a>-<a>Purdue</a> Foundation (now the IPFW Foundation), which controls IPFW&#x2019;s land. Under this agreement that is subject to quinquennial reviews by the <a>IU</a> system, <a>Purdue</a> is to administer IPFW&#x2019;s operations, except the medical programs and any <a>IU</a> academic programs [5]. Brokering this agreement and finalizing the Wallace administration&#x2019;s partially completed academic reorganization were the major accomplishments of the Lantz administration in advancing IPFW, the institution. During the Lantz administration, the Visual Arts Building, Parking Garage 1, Williams Theatre, and the Engineering, Technology, and Computer Science Building (then the Engineering and Technology Building) were constructed [5].</li>
  <li><strong>The Wartell Administration</strong> (1994&#x2013;present)&#x2014;The Wartell administration has the longest tenure on record and has realized two successful five-year strategic plans. Under Wartell, the university has commenced on its most aggressive building construction efforts in its history, which includes overseeing the addition of more than  to the campus property. His leadership is responsible for the construction of the <a>Holiday Inn</a> at IPFW, IPFW Student Housing on the Waterfield Campus (stages I&#x2013;III), the Medical Education Center, the Science Building, the Rhinehart Music Center, the PLEX indoor soccer building and the Hefner Soccer Fields (12 outdoor soccer fields), Parking Garage 2, the Willis Family Bridge, the Ron Venderly Family Bridge, and the forthcoming Keith Busse Steel Dynamics Alumni Center and the Student Services Complex [5]. The administration&#x2019;s most noteworthy academic advancements include expanding the university&#x2019;s number of certificate and degree options to more than 200 possibilities. A long-standing advocate for quality instruction and access to education, Wartell secured a number of endowed and named professorships and top-level student scholarships. His administration executed the School-Based Concurrent Enrollment Program, where students who attend partnering high schools in northeast Indiana can earn IPFW General Education college credits that also satisfy high school graduation requirements. The administration has also been a front-runner in community engagement, creating the IPFW Centers of Excellence&#x2014;more than a dozen research centers specializing in areas as broad as green building and animal conservation to wireless technologies and pension plan management [5]. A large number of public/private partnerships have been established as well, with organizations that include the defense industry, the Fort Wayne Center for Learning, the Fort Wayne Philharmonic, the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, Parkview Health Systems, and PBS39 WFWA-DT, to name a few [5]. Also under Wartell&#x2019;s leadership, IPFW&#x2019;s endowment and level of public and private funding has significantly increased to previously unprecedented levels. The endowment has risen from $3 million to $35 million since he took office, and more than $60 million dollars has been raised from external sources [5]. The Wartell administration also ushered its 16 men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s sports into <a>NCAA</a> Division I athletic competition, as well as membership in <a>The Summit League</a> conference.</li>

<h3>Student Housing</h3>
<p><a>right|250px|thumb|Waterfield Student Housing.</a> Beginning with fall semester 2004, the university introduced a new variety of student housing to northeast Indiana&#x2014;IPFW Student Housing on the Waterfield Campus. Rather than traditionally cramped dorm rooms, apartment-style housing opened with seven buildings, featuring furnished rooms, full kitchens, private bedrooms, and even free wireless Internet access. Phase II of the student housing initiative continued with two more buildings in August 2007, with total student housing occupancy approaching nearly 750 residents. Phase III of the project, which opened in August 2010, added 448 beds divided between four new residence buildings, bringing total occupancy to more than 1,200 students. Another student community center, The Clubhouse&#x2014;a larger version of the existing Cole Commons, complete with classrooms&#x2014;was added as well as a maintenance facility [7].</p>
<h3>Boundaries</h3>
<p>As can be seen in from an <a>aerial vantage</a>, IPFW's campus is composed of four parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <strong>main academic campus</strong>, bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard (<a>Indiana State Road 930</a>) to the south, Crescent Avenue (<a>Indiana State Road 37</a>) to the east, Saint Joseph River to the west, and the Canterbury Green Apartment complex and golf course to the north;</li>
  <li>the <strong>residential campus</strong>, bounded by Crescent Avenue to the west, Coliseum Boulevard and Trier Road to the south, and Hobson Road to the East;</li>
  <li>the <strong>research-incubator campus</strong>, bounded by St. Joe Road to the west, Stellhorn Road (<a>Indiana State Road 37</a>) to the south, Dean Drive to the north, and Sirlin Drive to the east;[<a>http://www.ipfw.edu/assets/images/news/downloadable/projects/hotelGardenBridge.gif</a>]</li>
  <li>the <strong>former McKay-family farm</strong>, the portion of campus on the western bank of the Saint Joseph River, which is bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard to the south, Saint Joseph River to the east, and development to the north and west. The &quot;Plex&quot; indoor soccer facility and the <a>Holiday Inn</a> hotel that are on this portion of the IPFW campus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grounds and Landmarks</h3>
<p>Architecturally, IPFW buildings generally feature brick in various shades of brown or tan as a variation on <a>Purdue</a> West Lafayette&#x2019;s red brick. This is in contrast to IPFW&#x2019;s sibling university, Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Indianapolis, where <a>IUPUI</a>&#x2019;s buildings generally feature the <a>Indiana</a> limestone that <a>IU</a> Bloomington&#x2019;s buildings feature. Recent administrative efforts to improve campus accessibility, traffic flow, and grounds beautification have paid off to make IPFW more a campus of pedestrians and less a commuter campus focused on just a few buildings on one end of the campus. With the Willis Family Bridge over Crescent Avenue and the Ron Venderly Family Bridge spanning the <a>St. Joseph River</a>, IPFW&#x2019;s residential campus, from east to west, has been made easier to navigate. The grounds at IPFW are manicured and landscaped as a pastoral multiple-hundred-acre park due in part to Virginia Ayers, an avid long-time exerciser on campus who willed her estate to IPFW upon her death. The campus landscape features the following highlights [8]:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Geogarden geological tour (northwest of Kettler Hall)</li>
  <li>the student-designed Set in Stone (art collection between Helmke Library and Parking Garage 1)</li>
  <li>the life-size bronze Mastodon statue (Alumni Plaza)</li>
  <li>the student-designed Student Legacy 25th Anniversary Sculpture composed of 25 upright poles of multiple colors, celebrating campus diversity and dedicated during the university&#x2019;s 25th anniversary (north of the Liberal Arts Building)</li>
  <li>Chessboard, a human-sized chess board with giant chess pieces available for students to borrow (west of Walb Student Union)</li>
  <li>the wooded Aquarius Park, containing the Friends (of IPFW) Pavilion (west of Walb Student Union)</li>
  <li>the Onwood Memorial Wildflower Garden adjacent to the Friends Pavilion</li>
  <li>the Millennium Marker that serves as IPFW&#x2019;s entrance sign along Coliseum Boulevard</li>
  <li>the Peace Pole Sculpture that is inscribed with translations of &#x201c;May peace prevail on earth&#x201d; in a variety of languages (near the Friends Pavilion)</li>
  <li>Matilda, a mastodon wall mural near the southeast entrance to Gates Sports Center</li>
  <li>the graduate-designed Lascaux Stacked Plus One sculpture (north of Aquarius Park)</li>
  <li>the Dirrim Quiet Spot along the eastern bank of the St. Joseph River (west of the Visual Arts Building)</li>
  <li>the Connie and Dan Dickey Alumni Fountain, a &#x201c;flat&#x201d; fountain with jumping jets of water (near Alumni Plaza)</li>
  <li>the SCAN (Stop Child Abuse &amp; Neglect) Children&#x2019;s Garden (north of Williams Theatre)</li>
