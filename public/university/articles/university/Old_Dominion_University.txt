<p><strong>Old Dominion University</strong> (ODU) is a large public <a>research university</a> located in historic <a>Norfolk, Virginia</a>, <a>United States</a>. It was established in 1930 as the Norfolk Division of the <a>College of William &amp; Mary</a>. ODU awarded its first bachelor's degrees in 1956, became Old Dominion College in 1962, and attained university status in 1969. ODU offers a full range of degree programs and is one of the nation's largest providers of online distance learning courses. Old Dominion University derives its name from one of Virginia's state nicknames, &quot;<a>The Old Dominion</a>.&quot; Given to the state by <a>King Charles II of England</a> for remaining loyal to the crown during the <a>English Civil War</a>, the nickname serves as a reminder of ODU's royal roots. The College Guide of Washington Monthly Magazine, which rates institutions based on their record for good works as well as research, places Old Dominion University at 120 in a ranking of 242 major colleges and universities. According to the National Science Foundation, eighteen ODU programs are ranked amongst the top 100 of their respective national peers in terms of R&amp;D expenditures. The university is ranked 61st in total R&amp;D expenditures amongst institutions without affiliated medical schools, 79th in DOD research, and 51st in NASA research.  </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|165 px|left|Classes were first held in the old Larchmont Elementary School (c.1913)</a> The foundations of Old Dominion University began in the minds of administrators and officials at the <a>College of William and Mary</a> in the first decades of the last century.  Notable among these men were Robert M. Hughes, a W&amp;M Board of Visitors member from 1893&#x2013;1917, and <a>J.A.C. Chandler</a>, the 18th president of that school.  With the collective efforts of many, a two year branch division was established on March 13, 1930, and first held classes in September of that year with 206 students (125 men and 81 women).</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Rollins Hall</a> As a comprehensive university, Old Dominion University offers and develops liberal arts, science, technology and professional programs. The University offers 70 <a>bachelor's degree</a>s in various fields and 60 master's and 35 doctoral degrees. ODU's TELETECHNET <a>distance learning</a> program is one of the nation's largest and accounts for nearly one third of student enrollment. ODU Distance Learning is affiliated with the <a>Southern Regional Education Board</a>'s Electronic Campus. ODU is the only university in the US to offer MBA concentrations in Maritime, Transportation, and Port Logistics Management and has well-respected programs in Marine Science and Coastal Engineering.</p>
<p>Because Hampton Roads is a major international maritime and commerce center, the university has a special mission for the <a>Commonwealth of Virginia</a> in commerce, and in international affairs and cultures. With the principal marine and aerospace activities of the Commonwealth concentrated in Hampton Roads, the university has a significant commitment to science, engineering and technology, specifically in marine science, aerospace and other fields of major importance to the region. Many departments conduct cooperative research with <a>NASA</a>. The Department of Music is housed in the Diehn Fine and Performing Arts building.  Diehn is the home of the ODU Symphony Orchestra (ODUSO), Wind Ensemble, Concert Choir, Jazz Choir, Jazz Ensemble, as well as other smaller ensembles like the Diehn String Quartet and Diehn Chorale.  Students at ODU pursuing a degree in music have a choice of bachelor degrees in music performance, music education, music history, and music.  The Diehn building also houses the Wilson G. Chandler Recital Hall, where performances of the Diehn Concert Series and student recitals are held.  The head of the department is currently John Toomey. ODU offers several tracks of study within the English Department, including: literature, journalism, creative writing, linguistics, and professional writing</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>ROTC program</h3>
<p>The ODU Army ROTC <a>battalion</a> was established in September 1969 in the Darden College of Education.  The first cadets were commissioned on July 4, 1971. As of spring of 2008, ODU has been recognized as having the sixth largest Army ROTC unit out of 262 programs found nationwide. &lt;br&gt; Its Navy ROTC program is run in conjunction with the neighboring campuses of <a>Norfolk State University</a> and <a>Hampton University</a>. The Hampton Roads Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps is one of the largest officer training battalions in the nation, consisting of over 250 Sailors, Marines, and Midshipmen, with a much above average prior enlisted presence. With HRNROTC's close proximity to Norfolk Naval Base, students have access to vast resources and training facilities inaccessible to most other NROTC batallions.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>Old Dominion University recognizes over 200 student organizations. These groups include professional organizations, honor societies, religious organizations, minority students, and groups for students with common interests and majors as well as a variety of traditional, multicultural, and professional sororities and fraternities. The Student Government Association has direct authority over student organizations.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>200px|right|ODU IFC Officers</a> --&gt; Old Dominion has a complex and diverse <a>Greek system</a> with fourteen fraternities and eleven sororities.  There are also a wide variety of <a>service fraternities</a> active on campus. </p>
<h3>Campus ministries=== &#x0009;</h3>
<p>ODU students can join campus ministries which are coordinated by the University Chaplain's Association (UCA). Ministries include the <a>United Methodist</a>, <a>Baptist</a>, <a>Roman Catholic</a>, <a>Episcopalian</a>, <a>Presbyterian</a> and <a>Lutheran</a> denominationally sponsored ministries. <a>InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a> has a presence at ODU and are members of the UCA. Each of these churches has a campus ministry presence at ODU, as does Hillel, the <a>Society for Jewish Students</a>, and the <a>Tidewater Islamic Center</a>, which serves the <a>Muslim</a> community at ODU. The UCA and its constituent members are nationally recognized as one of the most effective campus ministry programs in the United States.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Old Dominion University has a school newspaper called <a>The Mace &amp; Crown</a>, and a student radio and TV station called <a>WODU</a>. WODU is broadcast online and across campus on a closed circuit channel (Chan. 51 on <em>Monarch Vision</em>). It has been live on-air since 1974.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Old Dominion's 18 athletic teams are known as the <a>Monarchs</a> (men) and <a>Lady Monarchs</a> (women) and compete in the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a>. Old Dominion University athletic teams have captured 28 team national championships and four individual titles.  The school's best-known sports team is the Lady Monarchs <a>basketball</a> team, which has won three national championships in 1979 (AIAW), 1980 (AIAW) and 1985 (NCAA). The Lady Monarchs also made it to the 1997 Women's NCAA Championship Game, losing to Tennessee. ODU athletic teams have won a further 28 national championships including 15 in men's and women's sailing and 9 in women's field hockey. The Lady Monarchs' nine national titles in field hockey are unprecedented in NCAA record books for most titles in that sport by the same school.</p>
<p>On March 2010, Dr. Wood Selig became the new athletic director. Previously, Dr. Selig was the athletic director at <a>Western Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>Old Dominion also holds an important place in the history of women's collegiate athletics, having awarded the first athletic scholarship to any woman in the state of Virginia for a varsity sport when <a>Nancy Lieberman</a> was awarded a scholarship to play women's basketball.&lt;BR&gt; [[Image:OldDominion-TedConstanceConvocationCenter-ODUvsVT-20051230.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Old Dominion's [[Ted Constant Convocation Center]]]] The Old Dominion University Lady Monarchs basketball team have won three National Championship titles.  In 1979 and 1980, the Lady Monarchs were AIAW Champions.  In 1985, they captured the NCAA Div. 1 crown.  In addition, the Lady Monarchs have captured five Sun Belt conference championship titles (1983, 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1990), and captured 17 CAA championship titles, winning every year since 1991-92. In addition, Old Dominion's athletic teams have captured 48 championships in the Colonial Athletic Association.</p>
<h3>Basketball program</h3>
<p> The Old Dominion University Monarchs (men's) basketball team have captured five CAA championship titles (1992, 1995, 1997, 2005, and 2010) since their conference admission in 1992, which is the most among present CAA schools. In 2007, they received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, when the team went 24-8 and finished 37th in RPI. That season included a notable 13-point win at 8th ranked Georgetown. Their most recent trip to the NCAA tournament was with an automatic bid after capturing the 2010 CAA title. During the NCAA tournament, the 11th seeded Monarchs managed a 1-point first-round upset over the 6th seeded Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>In 2002 ODU opened the <a>Ted Constant Convocation Center</a> for the 2002-2003 basketball season.  &quot;The Ted&quot; has 8,600 fully cushioned seats, 16 luxury suites, and a state-of-the-art scoreboard.  In addition to being used for home basketball games, the Constant Center hosts family-oriented events as well as concerts, lectures, and commencement ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Football program</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|right|300px|Foreman Field Postcard (c. 1946)</a> On June 14, 2005, its <a>Board of Visitors</a> approved by a 14-0 vote the creation of an <a>NCAA Division I</a> team, which began play on September 5, 2009.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2007, ODU's Athletic Director Jim Jarrett announced that <a>Bobby Wilder</a>, the associate head football coach at the <a>University of Maine</a>, would be the head football coach at Old Dominion University.  The team signed its first class in 2008.  As is the case with many new football programs, all players on the 2008 Monarchs football team were redshirted, and when added with the 2009 signing class and transfers from I-A schools, have formed the nucleus of the school's first football team. ODU competes as an FCS program (formerly I-AA), and will be independent for two years before joining the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2011 season.</p>
<p>The history of football at ODU began with the Norfolk Division, which had a football team until 1941 known as the Norfolk Division <em>Braves</em>.  The program dissolved due to a rule against freshman players and a 10,000 USD debt.</p>
<p><a>Foreman Field</a>, formerly the <a>field hockey</a> and women's lacrosse teams' home venue, has been renovated to accommodate the new football program.  Field Hockey and women's lacrosse teams have been relocated to the Powhatan Sports Complex.</p>
<p>The final record for Old Dominion's 2009 football program was 9-2, the best winning record ever for a first-year collegiate football program.</p>
<p>Old Dominion's football program had continued success in 2010 finishing 8-3.</p>
<h3>Rowing program</h3>
<p>The ODU Rowing Club (ODURC) has been under the Recreational Sports department since 1985. The club is fully student-run and is funded largely by the student members of the club. ODURC has been very successful in recent years, as it has increased its membership.  Adding outstanding volunteer coaches in recent years has raised the competitiveness of the team greatly, and the men's club won a national championship in May, 2008. Today, male and female rowers continue to compete as a club; in 2008 rowing also became a varsity sport for female students, and a full-time coach was hired for the new women's team.  Within their first year at varsity level, the women's team placed at a national competition.  The decision to elevate only the women's team to varsity status was made to keep ODU compliant with <a>Title IX</a> regulations, providing balance to the increased spending on men's athletics that a football program brought.</p>
<h3>Big Blue Club</h3>
<p>The Big Blue Club is the official booster club for Old Dominion Athletics.  The official name of the group is The Old Dominion University Intercollegiate Foundation, which has 501-C-3 designation as a non-profit organization.</pre>
<h3>Monarch Maniacs</h3>
<p>Monarch Maniacs is the student (undergrads and grads) group that supports the athletic programs.  The group is administered by the student activities department.</pre>
<h2>Campus development</h2>
<h3>Recent growth</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|270px|Student Quad model</a> In recent years, Old Dominion University has undergone extensive growth.  The swell of new construction was kicked off in 2001 with the building of the <a>Ted Constant Convocation Center</a>.  This 8,600 seat arena has become the home of both men's and women's basketball, as well as a premiere venue for concerts and other performances.  The &quot;Ted&quot; as it is affectionately called by students and alumni is the jewel of a $55 million  development known as The University Village.  Expanding the campus eastward across Hampton Boulevard, the Village is a mix of student apartments, shops, and restaurants and has become a destination for both students and the community.  In 2008 a new Spring Hill Suites hotel was completed along with the University's new bookstore.</p>
<p>Student housing has grown at ODU.  The Quad, a collection of six new residential buildings &mdash; Ireland House (2006), Virginia House (2007), Scotland House (2008), France House (2009), England House (2009), Dominion House (2009) &mdash; and offices brings Old Dominion University closer to its goal of becoming a more residential university.  Constructed alongside the Quad is the new student recreation center.  This new center will be the heart of Old Dominion's healthy campus featuring a cardio/weight area, a climbing wall, fitness classes, two gyms, an indoor swimming pool, racquetball courts and more.  ODU has expanded its sports facilities, recently completing the Folkes-Stevens Indoor Tennis Center and the Powhatan Sports Complex, a  facility that will house the intercollegiate athletic programs of field hockey, women's lacrosse, and football.  Another football-related project is the renovation of Old Dominion University's historic <a>Foreman Field</a> in preparation for the sport's reintroduction in 2009.</p>
<h3>University Village</h3>
<p>Established in 1995, the Real Estate Foundation has taken the lead in the development of the University Village, a mixed use development including retail, residential and office buildings.  The results of its work are visible to all in the form of the University Village Apartments, restaurants, shops, the North Village Parking Garage, the Innovation Research Park, Marriott SpringHill Suites Hotel, and new Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Maglev</h3>
<p>In 1999 ODU agreed to work with American Maglev on a project to build a <a>Maglev</a> system on its campus. The project was conceived as a test of the technology and spans less than a mile in length. Originally offered to several other institutes of higher learning, including <a>Virginia Tech</a>, all of these institutes rejected it due to concerns regarding the projected cost and safety of such a system. At least one of these concerns has proven true, as the $14 million originally slated towards this project has proven inadequate.  Groundbreaking was held in 2001 and the project was completed in 2002 although the technology was proved defective. The original lofty goal of connecting <a>Hampton Roads</a> with <a>Washington, D.C.</a> by the <a>Jamestown 2007</a> celebration was not met, but hope remains for the Maglev train as it is now a research project for the College of Engineering.  The research team's objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies for low-cost Maglev transportation systems.</p>
