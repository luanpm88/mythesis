It was also the first university in the nation to offer a bachelor's degree in <a>pedology</a>.  Programs  include a rare doctoral degree in education leadership, a program for education administrators.</p>
<p>In 1995, <a>NASA</a> and the <a>National Science Foundation</a> awarded $27 million as one of only six schools in the nation declared <a>Model Institutions for Excellence</a> in science, engineering, and mathematics.  This led to a strengthening of the already growing computer science program; in 1999, the <a>Maryland Higher Education Commission</a> approved the school's additional focus in computers and technology.  Since then new technology related programs including music technology and a strengthened computer science department have been added.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Main Entrance, Center for Business &amp; Graduate Studies</a> Bowie State's history began in 1865 when the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People established the Baltimore Normal School in <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>Maryland</a> to train African American teachers.  In 1908 the school was renamed Normal School No. 3 after the state Board of Education provided funding for and assumed control of the institution.</p>
<p>By 1914 the school had moved to <a>Prince George's County</a>, <a>Maryland</a> and become known as the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie.  From 1911 until 1921, <a>Don Speed Smith Goodloe</a> served as principal and in 1914-15 built the <a>Don S. S. Goodloe House</a>, which was added in 1988 to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. From 1921 until 1941, <strong>Dr. Leonidas S. James</strong> served as principal. It became the Maryland State Teachers College at Bowie in 1935 and Bowie State College in 1963. </p>
<p>In 1925, under the auspices of <strong>Dr. Leonidas S. James</strong>, a two-year professional curriculum in teacher education was created and was later expanded to a three-year program. A four-year program was created in 1935 for the training of elementary school teachers. With approval from the State Board of Education, the program was expanded in 1951 to include training for junior high school teachers.  Ten years later, a teacher-training program for secondary education was established.  In 1963, a liberal arts program was started..</p>
<p>Bowie State College was authorized to grant its first graduate degree, a Master of Education, in 1970. The school's first doctoral program was also in the field of education, with a Doctorate of Educational Leadership, earned by 16 students during the May 2005 commencement.  Other recent additions to the campus include the Christa McAuliffe Residential Community (CMRC) apartments, the Computer Science Building, a state-of-the-art facility serving the computer science and computer technology programs, and the $6.5 million Center for Learning Technology (CLT), serving the College of Professional Studies.</p>
<p>On campus, the Bowie State Satellite Operations Control Center (BSOCC) is an orbiting satellite operation and control center allowing students to gain hands-on experience in such a facility.  In 2003, the center went fully operational.  It is a joint venture operated by the university, the <a>Honeywell Corporation</a>, and <a>NASA</a>'s <a>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in <a>Greenbelt, MD</a>.</p>
<p>In September 2007, the University began negotiations with Prince George's County for the transfer of  of land to the school. According to county documents, the land, valued at $1.3 million, would cost the University nothing if used &quot;for educational uses including facilities that benefit the welfare of students and faculty in their educational experience at the University.&quot; The addition of this land would increase the size of the university by 63%. The main focus for the land is the development of additional student dorms. The land will also be used to establish several retail businesses that will cater to students and the community.</p>
