<p> <strong>Cardiff University</strong> () is a <a>university</a> located in the <a>Cathays Park</a> area of <a>Cardiff</a>, <a>Wales</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a>. It received its Royal charter in 1883 and is a member of the <a>Russell Group of Universities</a>. The university is consistently recognised as providing the best university education in Wales. In the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, almost 60 per cent of all research at Cardiff University was assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent - 4* and 3* the top two categories of assessment. Ranked number 122 of the world's top universities, Cardiff University celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2008. Before August 2004, the university was officially known as <strong>University of Wales, Cardiff</strong> (), although it used the name <em>Cardiff University</em> publicly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Park Place entrance</a>&#x200e;The Aberdare Report of 1881 recommended the foundation of university colleges in <a>North Wales</a> and <a>South Wales</a> to complement the already established University College, Wales (now the <a>University of Wales, Aberystwyth</a>), in <a>Aberystwyth</a>.  There was considerable debate about whether the southern college should be located in Cardiff or Swansea.  The case for Cardiff was strengthened by stressing the need to take account of the interests of <a>Monmouthshire</a>, at that time not legally considered part of Wales. This influenced the name of the new body.  Following a public appeal that raised &#x00a3;37,000, the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire opened on October 24, 1883, offering studies in Biology, Chemistry, English, French, German, Greek, History, Latin, Mathematics &amp; Astronomy, Music, Welsh, Logic &amp; Philosophy and Physics. The University College was incorporated by <a>Royal Charter</a> the following year. <a>John Viriamu Jones</a> was appointed as the University&#x2019;s first Principal, at age 27. The only college in Wales with its own degree awarding powers at this time was <a>St David's University College</a>. As such, Cardiff entered students for the examinations of the <a>University of London</a> until, in 1893, it became one of the founding institutions of the <a>University of Wales</a> and began awarding their degrees.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Chemistry block of Main Builiding</a> In 1885, <a>Aberdare Hall</a> opened as the first hall of residence, allowing women access to the university. This moved to its current site in 1895, but remains a single-sex hall. 1904 saw the appointment of the first female <a>professor</a> in the UK, Millicent McKenzie.</p>
<p>Architect <a>W.D. Caroe</a> sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former college (<a>Trinity College, Cambridge</a>) with the picturesque balance of many of the <a>University of Oxford</a> colleges. Building work on Main Building commenced in 1905 and was completed in many stages, the first in 1909. Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built. Prior to then, from its founding in 1883, the University was based in the Old Infirmary on Newport Road, Cardiff which is now part of the University&#x2019;s Queen&#x2019;s Buildings.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|University buildings on Park Place</a> <a>thumb|right|240px|The main building of Cardiff University</a> In 1931, the School of Medicine, which had been founded as part of the College in 1893 when the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Pharmacology were founded, was split off to form the <a>University of Wales College of Medicine</a>. In 1972, the College was renamed <strong>University College, Cardiff</strong>. </p>
<p>In 1988, financial problems caused University College, Cardiff and the <a>University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology</a> to merge, forming the <strong>University of Wales College, Cardiff</strong>. Following changes to the constitution of the University of Wales in 1996, this became the <strong>University of Wales, Cardiff</strong>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the university's computer systems served as the home for <a>The Internet Movie Database</a>. In 1997, the College was granted full independent degree awarding-powers by the <a>Privy Council</a> (though, as a member of the University of Wales it could not begin using them) and in 1999 the public name of the university was changed to Cardiff University. Some considered this part of an effort at Cardiff to set itself apart from the other colleges of the University of Wales, none of which are members of the <a>Russell Group</a>.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2004 the University of Wales, Cardiff merged with the <a>University of Wales College of Medicine</a>. The merged institution separated from the collegiate <a>University of Wales</a> and officially took the name Cardiff University.</p>
<h2>Cardiff today</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|240px|Glamorgan Building</a> In 2002, ideas were floated to re-merge Cardiff with the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM) following the publication of the <a>Welsh Assembly Government's</a> review of higher education in Wales. This merger became effective on August 1, 2004, on which date Cardiff University ceased to be a constituent institution of the University of Wales and became an independent &quot;link institution&quot; affiliated to the federal University. The process of the merger was completed on December 1, 2004 when the <a>Act of Parliament</a> transferring UWCM's assets to Cardiff University received Royal Assent. On December 17 it was announced that the <a>Privy Council</a> had given approval to the new Supplemental Charter and had granted university status to Cardiff, legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but these have been replaced by Cardiff degrees. Medicine, dentistry and other health-related areas began to admit students for Cardiff degrees in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2004, Cardiff University and the <a>Swansea University</a> entered a partnership to provide a four-year graduate-entry medical degree. An annual intake of around 70 post-graduate students undertake an accelerated version of the Cardiff course at the Swansea University for the first two years before joining undergraduate students at Cardiff for the final two years. All medicine/surgery graduates are awarded the degrees MB BCh. <a>thumb|left|240px|Bute Building</a> However from September 2009 Swansea University will be independently providing medical education in a revised 4-yr Graduate Entry Degree.</p>
<p>In 2005, The Wales College of Medicine, which is part of the University, launched the North Wales Clinical School in <a>Wrexham</a> in collaboration with the <a>North East Wales Institute of Higher Education</a> in Wrexham and the <a>University of Wales, Bangor</a> and with the <a>National Health Service in Wales</a>. This has been funded with &#x00a3;12.5&nbsp;million from the <a>Welsh Assembly</a> and will lead to the trebling of the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four year period.</p>
<p>The university has a rivalry with nearby <a>Swansea University</a>, against whom every year they have a <a>varsity match</a> termed the <a>Welsh Varsity</a>.</p>
<p>The university also has a popular Centre for <a>Lifelong Learning</a> which has been teaching a wide range of courses to the public for over 125 years. In July 2009, the University announced it was ending the teaching of over 250 humanities courses at the centre making over 100 staff redundant. The University has since reintroduced a number of humanities courses for a trial period beginning in 2010.</p>
<p>In June 2010, the University launched three new Research Institutes, each of which offers a new approach to a major issue. They are the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, the Sustainable Places Research Institute, and the Neurosciences &amp; Mental Health Research Institute.</p>
