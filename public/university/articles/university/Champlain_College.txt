<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded as Burlington Collegiate Institute by G.W. Thompson in 1878, a series of acquisitions changed the College's name and location multiple times. It was renamed Burlington Business College in 1884, moved to Bank Street in 1905, and relocated to Main Street in 1910. In 1958, the College took its current name and moved to Hill Section of Burlington, where it remains today. That year, it offered <a>associate's degree</a> programs and enrolled about 60 students.</p>
<p>About 60% of the students, 1,100, boarded at the college in 2009-10.</p>
<p>In 2010, Perry Hall was renovated and now houses the Advising and Registration Center, Admissions, Financial Aid, and serves as a general purpose Student Welcome Center.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate education</h3>
<p>Champlain issues bachelor's degrees in over 30 fields of study, ranging from Computer &amp; Digital Forensics to Radiography. Some of the most popular undergraduate programs include Business, Graphic Design, and Electronic Game Programming.</p>
<p>Starting with the class of 2011, general education is taught in the form of an interdisciplinary core curriculum. Each course brings together 3 or 4 discrete disciplines with the use of various literature and open-ended discussion topics. First-year courses focus on the self, second-year on the community, and third year on global topics. Through courses such as <a>Rhetoric</a>, Concepts of the Self, and Concepts of Community, students gain a background in the <a>liberal arts</a> and sciences. Beginning in the fall of 2008, incoming students also participate in an out-of-the-classroom life skills program. This life skills program, called the Life Experience &amp; Action Dimension or LEAD, is part of Champlain's Education in 3-D initiative. LEAD aims to build knowledge in four areas: understanding personality styles, building inclusive community, lifelong career management, and financial sophistication.  This knowledge is intended to enable students to adapt to changing environments, make good decisions in difficult situations, and pursue short and long-term goals successfully. LEAD requirements are completed outside of class in groups led by student Peer Advisers. The groups are established based on where they live on campus (commuters are in a group of their own). Completion of the LEAD activities is required in order for students to register for their classes the next semester.</p>
<p>One part of the Core is the Global Module. The Global Module is a discussion forum where students from Champlain College communicate with students from other countries around the world. The module features a guided discussion that focuses on important issues and gives students a perspective from outside the country. The Global Module is required for all students in the Core program.</p>
<p><em>U.S. News America's Best Colleges 2009</em> ranks Champlain College 12th among baccalaureate colleges in the North.</p>
<h3>Online programs</h3>
<p>The college also offers a variety of programs online. Some associate's and bachelor's degrees, as well as certificates, can be obtained through online courses. Champlain offers four (soon to be 6) master's degrees, which heavily incorporate online learning. In 2009, OEDb ranked the college third out of 44 institutions that offer most of their degree programs online.</p>
<h3>Programs Abroad</h3>
<p>The Champlain Abroad campuses in Montreal and Dublin provide students with personal and professional experiences that will extend their sense of self and their place in the global community. The Champlain Abroad programs provide students from Champlain College and other higher education institutions in the United States, an opportunity to explore, immerse, and engage in Canadian or Irish culture through a curriculum that extends beyond the classroom walls and takes students into the community and culture.</p>
<p>Students may create an individual experience abroad. </p>
