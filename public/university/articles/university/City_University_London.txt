<p>  <strong>City University London</strong>, usually just known in the UK as <strong>City University</strong>, is a <a>British</a> <a>university</a> based in <a>Northampton Square</a>, <a>Islington</a>, <a>London</a>. The university has a research experience of over 100 years and has often been highly ranked for its graduate <a>employability</a> and graduate salaries. The University's mission, as outlined in its Strategy, is to &quot;lead London in education, research and knowledge transfer for businesses and the professions&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The City University traces its origin to the Northampton Institute, established in 1894, and named after the <a>Marquess of Northampton</a>, who donated the land on which the Institute was built, between <a>Northampton Square</a> and St John Street in <a>Islington</a>. The Institute was established to provide for the education and welfare of the local population. It was constituted under the City of London Parochial Charities Act (1883), with the objective of &quot;the promotion of the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes&quot;.</p>
<p>Originally there were six departments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mechanical Engineering and Metal Trades</li>
  <li>Artistic Crafts</li>
  <li>Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering</li>
  <li><a>Horology</a> (the science of time and art of clock-making)</li>
  <li>Electro-Chemistry</li>
  <li>Domestic Economy and Women's Trades</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1903-04 a separate Technical <a>Optics</a> department was established.</p>
<p>In 1909 the first students qualified for University of London BSc degrees in Engineering as internal students.</p>
<p>In 1908 the Institute was used for the <a>Olympic games</a>.</p>
<p>The Institute was designated a &quot;<a>College of Advanced Technology</a>&quot; in 1957.</p>
<p>In 1971 the <a>Apollo 15</a> astronauts visited City University London and presented the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Tait, with a piece of <a>heat shield</a> from the Apollo 15 <a>rocket</a>.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|220px|Northampton Square in front of the main university building</a> The Chancellor of the University is the <a>Lord Mayor of the City of London</a> <a>ex officio</a>. For a number of years, students have taken part in the annual <a>Lord Mayor's Show</a>, representing the University in one of the country's largest and liveliest parades. The day-to-day running of the university is the responsibility of the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>. The current Vice-Chancellor is <a>Professor Paul Curran.</a> The University is organised into seven schools:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>The University offers <a>Bachelor's</a>, <a>Master's</a>, and <a>Doctoral</a> <a>degrees</a> as well as certificates and diplomas at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. More than two thirds of City's programmes are recognised by the appropriate <a>professional bodies</a> such as the <a>BCS</a>, <a>BPS</a>, <a>CILIP</a>, <a>ICE</a>, <a>RICS</a> etc. in recognition of the high standards of relevance to the professions. The University also has an online careers network where over 2,000 former students offer practical help to current students.</p>
