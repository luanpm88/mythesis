<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Prior to formation</h3>
<p>[[File:Great hall.jpg|thumb|right|An early view of the [[Great Hall of the University of Leeds|Great Hall]], next to the Clothworkers' Court]] The university's history is linked to the development of <a>Leeds</a> as an international centre for the textile industry and clothing manufacture in the <a>United Kingdom</a> during the <a>Victorian era</a>. The university's roots can be traced back to the formation of Schools of Medicine in <a>English Core Cities</a> to serve the general public.</p>
<p>Prior to 1900, only five universities--<a>University of Oxford</a> (founded somewhere between 1096&#x2013;1201), <a>University of Cambridge</a> (founded c. 1201), <a>University of London</a> (founded in 1836), <a>Durham University</a> (founded in 1832), and the federal <a>Victoria University</a> (founded in 1880)--had been established in England and one in Wales (<a>University of Wales</a>, founded in 1893). (The Victoria University was established in <a>Manchester</a> in 1880 as a federal university for the North of England, since the government was unwilling to raise <a>Owens College</a> to university status and grant it a <a>royal charter</a>. Owens College was the only member of the Victoria University from 1880 to 1884; from 1887 when Yorkshire College joined there were three member colleges.) Students in this period were awarded external degrees by the <a>University of London</a>.</p>
<h3>Victoria University and Royal Charter</h3>
<p>Leeds was given its first <a>university</a> in 1887 when the Yorkshire College joined the federal <a>Victoria University</a> on 3 November: the Victoria University had been established by royal charter in 1880; Owens College being at first the only member college. Leeds now found itself in an educational union with close social cousins from <a>Manchester</a> and <a>Liverpool</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Owens College, the Leeds section of the Victoria University had never barred women from its courses. However, it was not until special facilities were provided at the Day Training College in 1896 that women began enrolling in significant numbers. The first female student to begin a course at the university was Lilias Annie Clark, who studied Modern Literature and Education.</p>
<p>The Victoria University was a short-lived concept, as the multiple university locations in <a>Manchester</a> and <a>Liverpool</a> were keen to establish themselves as separate, independent universities. This was partially due to the benefits a university had for the cities of <a>Liverpool</a> and <a>Manchester</a> whilst the institutions were also unhappy with the practical difficulties posed by maintaining a federal arrangement across broad distances. The interests of the universities and respective cities in creating independent institutions was further spurred by the granting of a charter to the <a>University of Birmingham</a> in 1900 after lobbying from <a>Joseph Chamberlain</a>.</p>
<p>Following a <a>Royal Charter</a> and <a>Act of Parliament</a> in 1903, the then newly formed <a>University of Liverpool</a> began the fragmentation of the Victoria University by being the first member to gain independence. The University of Leeds soon followed suit and was granted a royal charter as an independent body by <a>King Edward VII</a> in 1904.</p>
<p>The <a>Victoria University</a> continued after the breakup of the group, with an amended constitution and renamed as the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> (though &quot;Victoria&quot; was usually omitted from its name except in formal usage) until September 2004. On October 1, 2004 a merger with the <a>University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> was enacted to form The <a>University of Manchester</a>.</p>
<h2>Present day</h2>
<p>[[File:Univ leeds tower.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Parkinson Building|The Parkinson Building]] <a>campanile</a>, which features prominently in the university logo and publications after re-branding in 2006.]] During the 2009&#x2013;10 academic year, over 32,800 students were attached to around 560 different first-degree programmes and approximately 300 postgraduate degree programmes. Whilst maintaining its strengths in the traditional subjects (for example more students studying languages and physical sciences than anywhere else in the UK), Leeds has also developed expertise in more distinctive and rare specialist areas such as Colour Chemistry, Fire Science, Nanotechnology and Aviation Technology with Pilot studies.</pre>
<p>In December 2004, financial pressures forced the University's governing body (the Council) to decide to close the Bretton campus. Activities at Bretton were moved to the main University campus in the summer of 2007 (allowing all Bretton-based students to complete their studies there). There was substantial opposition to the closure by the Bretton students. The University's other satellite site, Manygates in <a>Wakefield</a>, also closed, but Lifelong Learning and Healthcare programmes are continuing on a new site next to <a>Wakefield College</a>.</pre>
<p>In May 2006, the University began re-branding itself to bring together its visual identity to produce one consistent look. A new logo was produced, based on that used during the centenary celebrations in 2004, to replace the combined use of the modified University arms and the old <a>Parkinson Building</a>, which has been in use since 2004. The University arms will still be used in its original form for ceremonial purposes only. Individual department and service logos are also being phased out. Four university colours were also specified as being green, red, black and beige.</p>
<p>On the 12th October 2010, The Refectory of the <a>Leeds University Union</a> hosted a live edition of the <a>Channel 4 News</a>, with students, academics and economists expressing their reaction to the <a>Browne Review</a>, an independent review of Higher Education funding and student finance conducted by <a>John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley</a>. University of Leeds <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> and <a>Russell Group</a> chairman <a>Professor Michael Arthur</a> participated, giving an academic perspective alongside current vice-chancellor of <a>Kingston University</a> and former Pro Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Education at the University of Leeds, <a>Sir Peter Scott</a>. Midway through the broadcast a small group of protesters against the potential rise of <a>student debt</a> entered the building before being restrained and evacuated.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Development of campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Roger Stevens Building</a> The University has  of land in total, with the main campus taking up . The main campus is located  north of <a>Leeds city centre</a> and compromises of a mixture of <a>gothic</a>, <a>art deco</a>, <a>brutalist</a> and <a>postmodern</a> buildings, making it one of the most diverse university campuses in the country in terms of building styles and history. It is within walking distance of both the city centre and <a>Headingley</a>, a popular residential area for students wishing to live off campus. The main entrance to the campus for visitors by car is on Woodhouse Lane (<a>A660</a>), near the Parkinson Building.</p>
<p>The <a>Parkinson Building</a> is a <a>grade II listed</a> <a>art deco</a> building and <a>campanile</a> named after the late <a>Frank Parkinson</a>, a major benefactor of the university who oversaw many new build projects from 1936 onwards. These commitments culminating in the official opening of The <a>Parkinson Building</a> (of which Parkinson donated &#x00a3;200,000 towards) on the 9th November 1951. The tower of the building is a well-known landmark in the city of <a>Leeds</a> and is used in the university logo and as a university symbol.</p>
<p><a>thumb|190px|upright|left|Baines Wing</a> The university's <a>Great Hall</a> building is one of the most prominent buildings on campus alongside the <a>Parkinson Building</a> and the numerous <a>brutalist</a> buildings which are <a>Grade II</a> listed also. The <a>Great Hall</a> was built on a site of Beech Grove Hall Estate which was purchased in 1879 by the then Yorkshire College when joining the <a>Victoria University</a>. This was later demolished in 1884, to become the site of the Clothworkers buildings of the Baines Memorial Wing and the <a>Great Hall</a>. The buildings were designed by the renowned Victorian architect <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a> R.A in red pressed brick and had dressings of Bolton Wood stone in a <a>Gothic</a> Collegiate style. The cost of the build cost &#x00a3;22,000 and was raised partially by public appeal and served as the university library until the opening of the Brotherton Library. The <a>Great Hall</a> is now primerily used for examinations, meetings and <a>graduation</a> ceremonies.</p>
<p>In June 2010, post-war buildings at the University of Leeds were recommended by <a>English Heritage</a> to become <a>Grade II listed buildings</a>. The <a>modernist</a> and <a>brutalist</a> buildings being recognised include the newly <a>Grade II*</a> listed Roger Stevens Building, whilst the EC Stoner Building, Computer Science Building, Mathematics/Earth Sciences Building, Senior Common room, Garstang Building, Irene Manton Building, Communications and Edward Boyle Library and Henry Price Building have been recognised as <a>Grade II</a> listed buildings. These additions join the already listed 1877 <a>Great Hall</a> and Bains Wing (designed and built by <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a>), the School of Mineral Engineering, the Brotherton Library and the <a>Parkinson Building</a> which are <a>Grade II</a> listed.</p>
<p>In addition to the main campus, there is also a satellite location at <a>Wakefield</a>. Until the 2006&#x2013;07 academic year, some courses were taught at the <a>Bretton Hall</a> campus in <a>West Bretton</a>. The site closed in summer 2007 after which the courses taught there were relocated to the main campus in Leeds.</p>
<p>There is no railway station close to the main campus, however there are numerous bus routes which serve it. The proposed <a>Leeds Supertram</a> would have run past the campus. The currently proposed <a>Leeds Trolleybus</a> (northern line) will run past the campus, linking it with the city centre, Headingley and <a>Lawnswood</a>. The <a>Leeds Inner Ring Road</a> also lies close to the campus.</p>
<h3>Modern expansion</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Marjorie and Arnold Ziff Building, which houses student services as of 2010</a> The university has engaged in a wave of modern expansion since 2008, and has invested more than &#x00a3;300&nbsp;million in transforming its campus over the coming years, resulting in new state-of-the-art educational, research, residential and leisure facilities with a further &#x00a3;80&nbsp;million being spent to improve current assets. The programme of this expansion being one of the biggest capital investment projects in British higher education. Its over-arching vision is to provide staff and students with a world-class campus which is integral to the university's ambition and vision of securing a place among the world's top 50 universities.</p>
