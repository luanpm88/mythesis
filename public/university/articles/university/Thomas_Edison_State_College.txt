One of New Jersey's 12 public universities and colleges, Thomas Edison State College offers degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level.</pre>
<p>Thomas Edison State College was approved by the New Jersey Board of Education in December 1971, and established on July 1, 1972.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison State College moved into downtown <a>Trenton</a> in September 1979, at a time when other institutions were leaving cities. The 7-year-old college, which had spent three years at the Forrestal Center outside of Princeton, needed room for growth. At the same time, the state was looking for an appropriate tenant for the landmark Kelsey Building at the edge of the Capital Complex, while the city sought to preserve the building&#x2019;s historic use as a school. Built in 1911 and one of the architectural landmarks of the city, the Kelsey Building housed three schools before serving as the headquarters for Thomas Edison State College.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>

<h2>Proposed merger with Rutgers</h2>
<p>In March 2010, New Jersey Gov. <a>Chris Christie</a> proposed merging Thomas Edison State College into <a>Rutgers</a>. After thoughtful consideration and reflection by the governor and the legislature, a consensus was reached that the merger proposal would not go forward. On June 29, 2010, the governor, the legislative leadership in both houses, and of both parties, concurred with Thomas Edison State College&#x2019;s view that the <a>public interest</a> was best served by maintaining the <a>autonomy</a> and special <a>mission</a> of both Rutgers and Thomas Edison State College.</p>
