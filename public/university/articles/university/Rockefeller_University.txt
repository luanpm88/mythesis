<p>  The <strong>Rockefeller University</strong> is a private <a>university</a> offering <a>postgraduate</a> and <a>postdoctoral</a> education.  The Rockefeller University is located on <a>Upper East Side</a> of <a>Manhattan</a> in <a>New York City</a>, between 63rd and 68th Streets along York Avenue.</p>
<p>Its president is <a>Sir Paul Nurse</a>, who plans to leave Rockefeller University by the end of 2010.  <a>Marc Tessier-Lavigne</a>&#x2014;now executive vice president for research and chief scientific officer at Genentech&#x2014;is planned to succeed Nurse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Founder's Hall</a></p>
<p>What is now The Rockefeller University was founded in 1901 as The <strong>Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</strong> by oil baron and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>, who had earlier founded the <a>University of Chicago</a> in 1889.  Sometimes called simply The <strong>Rockefeller Institute</strong> (not to be confused with <a>The Rockefeller Foundation</a>, a philanthropic organization), its first director was <a>Simon Flexner</a>, former student of <a>William H. Welch</a>.  Its focus throughout much of the 1900s was the development of both <a>basic science</a> and <a>biomedical engineering</a>.   The institute changed its name to The Rockefeller University in 1965, after expanding its mission to include education.</p>
<p>Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from The Rockefeller Institute or The Rockefeller University.  Rockefeller scientists, for example, <a>established that DNA is the chemical element of heredity</a>, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can trigger cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, developed <a>methadone</a> maintenance for individuals addicted to heroin, devised the <a>AIDS &quot;cocktail&quot;</a> drug therapy, and identified the weight-regulating hormone <a>leptin</a>.</p>
<p>Twenty-three <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners have been associated with the university.  The <a>Rockefeller family</a> has maintained strong links with the institution throughout its history; <a>David Rockefeller</a>, for instance, is the Honorary Chairman and a Life Trustee.</p>

<h2>Faculty history</h2>
<p>In the mid 1970's, Rockefeller succeeded in attracting a few prominent academics in the humanities, most notably <a>Saul Kripke</a>, a notable logician, philosopher of language, and expositor of the work of <a>Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. More recently, its faculty were winners of the <a>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and the <a>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 2003. Faculty are assigned to any of six different research areas defined by the university.  However, due to the highly interdisciplinary culture that Rockefeller University fosters, many faculty are listed under several research areas.</p>
