<p> &lt;!-- A note on the use of CAPITALS: I have tried to use a capital University when talking about <em>the</em> University (or derivatives) but lower-case when referring to many universities, or universities in general. This is actually not in keeping with the capitalisation used in the quote from the Charter, but seems more appropriate to modern usage. --&gt;</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Bristol</strong> is a  <a>university</a> in <a>Bristol</a>, England. One of the so-called <a>&quot;red brick&quot; universities</a>, it received its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1909,  although its predecessor institution, <a>University College, Bristol</a>, had been in existence since 1876. The University has an annual <a>turnover</a> of &#x00a3;347m and is the largest independent employer in <a>Bristol</a>.</p>
<p>The University is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a>, European-wide <a>Coimbra Group</a> and the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a>, of which the University's Vice-Chancellor Prof <a>Eric Thomas</a> was Chair (2005&#x2013;2007).  The University of Bristol has approximately 18,000 students.</p>
<p>Bristol is the most popular multifaculty university in the UK, with over 14 applicants vying for each place. . For some of the most popular courses, such as <a>Economics</a>, the applicant to place ratio is often as high as 40:1.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>The earliest antecedent of the university was the engineering department of the <a>Merchant Venturers&#x2019; Technical College</a> (founded as a school as early as 1595) which became the Engineering faculty of Bristol University. The University was also preceded by <a>Bristol Medical School</a> (1833) and <a>University College, Bristol</a>, founded in 1876, The University was able to apply for a <a>Royal Charter</a> due to the financial support of the Wills and <a>Fry</a> families, who made their fortunes in <a>tobacco</a> plantations and <a>chocolate</a>, respectively. Although the <a>Wills Family</a> made huge sums of money from the slave using plantations, they later became <a>abolitionists</a> who gave their money to the city of Bristol. The Royal Charter was gained in May 1909, with 288 undergraduates and 400 other students entering the University in October 1909. <a>Henry Overton Wills III</a> became its first chancellor.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Historical development</h3>
<p> Since the founding of the University itself in 1909, it has grown considerably and is now one of the largest employers in the local area, although it is smaller by student numbers than the nearby <a>University of the West of England</a>. Bristol does not have a <a>campus</a> but is spread over a considerable geographic area. Most of its activities, however, are concentrated in the area of the city centre, referred to as the &quot;University Precinct&quot;. It is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of research-led UK universities, the <a>Coimbra Group</a> of leading European universities and the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a> (WUN). </p>

<h4>Early years</h4>
<p>After the founding of the University College in 1876, Government support began in 1889. After mergers with the Bristol Medical School in 1893 and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in 1909, this funding allowed the opening of a new Medical School and an Engineering School&#x2014;two subjects that remain among the University's greatest strengths. In 1908, gifts from the <a>Fry</a> and Wills families, particularly &#x00a3;100,000 from <a>Henry Overton Wills III</a> (&#x00a3;6m in today's money), were provided to endow a University for Bristol and the West of England, provided that a <a>Royal Charter</a> could be obtained within two years. In December, 1909, the King granted such a Charter and erected the University of Bristol. Wills died in 1911 and in tribute his sons <a>George</a> and <a>Harry</a> built the <a>Wills Memorial Building</a>, starting in 1913 and finally finishing in 1925. Today, it houses parts of the academic provision for <a>earth sciences</a> and <a>law</a>, and <a>graduation</a> ceremonies are held in its Great Hall. The Wills Memorial Building is a Grade II* listed building.</p>
<p>In 1920, George Wills bought the <a>Victoria Rooms</a> and endowed them to the University as a <a>Students' Union</a>. </p>
<p>At the point of foundation, the University was required to provide for the local community. This mission was behind the creation of the Department of Extra-Mural Adult Education in 1924 to provide courses to the local community. This mission continues today; a new admissions policy specifically caters to the 'BS' <a>postcode</a> area of <a>Bristol</a>.</p>
<p>Among the famous names associated with Bristol in this early period is <a>Paul Dirac</a>, who graduated in 1921 with a degree in engineering, before obtaining a second degree in mathematics in 1923 from <a>Cambridge</a>. For his subsequent pioneering work on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize for Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by <a>Ernest Rutherford</a>. It has since housed several <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners: <a>Cecil Frank Powell</a> (1950); <a>Hans Albrecht Bethe</a> (1967); and Sir <a>Nevill Francis Mott</a> (1977). The Laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the <a>Bristol Grammar School</a> and the city <a>museum</a>.</p>
<p><a>Sir Winston Churchill</a> became the University's third Chancellor in 1929, serving the University in that capacity until 1965. and out of character compared to the architecture of the rest of the <a>Clifton</a> area, having been mentioned in a <a>BBC</a> poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The University has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.</p>
<p>The 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the <a>Anderson Report</a>, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the University). the Students' Union AGM voted to disaffiliate from the <a>National Union of Students</a> (NUS). On both occasions, however, the subsequent referendum of all students reversed that decision and Bristol remains affiliated to the NUS.</p>
<p>In 2002, the University was involved in argument over press intrusion after details of the son of then-Prime Minister <a>Tony Blair</a>'s application to university were published in national newspapers. </p>
<p>As the number of <a>postgraduate</a> students has grown (particularly the numbers pursuing taught Master's Degrees), there eventually became a need for separate representation on University bodies and the Postgraduate Union (PGU) was established in 2000. Universities are increasingly expected to exploit the <a>intellectual property</a> generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses). In 2001, the university signed a 25-year research funding deal with IP2IPO, an intellectual property commercialisation company. In 2007, research activities were expanded further with the opening of the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) and The Bristol Institute for Public Affairs (BIPA).</p>
<p>In 2002, the University opened a new Centre for Sports, Exercise and Health in the heart of the University precinct. At a cost, local residents are also able to use the facilities.</p>
<p>Expansion of teaching and research activities continues. In 2004, the Faculty of Engineering completed work on the <a>Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering</a> (BLADE). This &#x00a3;18.5m project provides cutting-edge technology to further the study of dynamics and is the most advanced such facility in Europe. It was built as an extension to the Queen's Building and was officially opened by <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> in March 2005.</p>
<p>In January, 2005, The School of Chemistry was awarded &#x00a3;4.5m by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> to create Bristol ChemLabS: a Centre for Excellence in Teaching &amp; Learning (CETL), with an additional &#x00a3;350k announced for the capital part of the project in February, 2006. Bristol ChemLabS stands for Bristol Chemical Laboratory Sciences; it is the only Chemistry CETL in the UK.</p>
<p>There is also a plan to significantly redevelop the centre of the University Precinct in the coming years.</p>
<h4>2003 admissions controversy</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The University has been regarded as being <a>elitist</a> by some commentators, taking 41% of its undergraduate students from non-state schools, according to the most recent 2009/2010 figures, despite the fact that such pupils make up just 7% of the population in the UK. The high ratio of undergraduates from non-state school has led to some tension at the university. In late February and early March 2003, Bristol became embroiled in a row about admissions policies, with some private schools threatening a boycott based on their claims that, in an effort to improve equality of access, the University was discriminating against their students. These claims were hotly denied by the University. In August, 2005, following a large-scale survey, the <a>Independent Schools Council</a> publicly acknowledged that there was no evidence of bias against applicants from the schools it represented. The University has a new admissions policy, placed Bristol at 27th overall in the world, moving up seven places from its position in the 2009 <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings). The rankings also placed Bristol at 15th in the world in terms of reputation with employers, placing higher than several American <a>Ivy League</a> universities, including <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>Cornell</a> and <a>UPenn</a>.  Another international ranking, the <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, placed Bristol 62nd globally in 2007. According to data published in <em><a>The Telegraph</a></em> Bristol has the third-highest percentage of 'good honours' of any UK university, behind <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>. In the 2010 Centre for Higher Education's Development's Excellence Rankings, Bristol is one of only four UK Universities (Oxford, UCL and Manchester) to be rated Excellent in all seven departments. </p>
<p>However Bristol gained some of the lowest scores for student satisfaction in the 2008 National Student Survey and <em><a>The Daily Telegraph</a></em> have reported of student complaints about teaching quality. This has led to the recent deterioration in the University's rankings in the UK league tables, although it still ranks highly in international league tables.</p>
<p>The following courses offered by University of Bristol, managed to reach top 5 in the Times ranking (2008): Computer Science(3rd); Electrical and Electronic Engineering(3rd); Civil Engineering(5th); Biological Sciences(3rd); Mathematics (3rd); and Psychology (4th).</p>
<p>In addition, Bristol is particularly strong in the field of social sciences, particularly in Economics, Finance and Management, and was recently rated 4th in the 2008 Guardian University Guide for Business and Management Studies.</p>
<p>Bristol is also known for its research strength, having 15 departments gaining the top grade of 5* in the 2001 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>. Overall, 36 out of 46 departments rated gained the top two ratings of 5 or 5*, and 76% of all the academic staff working in departments scored these top two levels. In terms of teaching strength, Bristol had an average Teaching Quality Assessment score of 22.05/24 before the TQA was abolished. For admission in October 2010, Bristol reported an average of 10.2 applications per place with the average A-level score on admission being 478.5. Bristol's drop-out rate is also lower than the benchmark set by HEFCE of no more than 3.1%.</p>

<h2>Students' Union and student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:070327 ukbris ubu01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Bristol Union]] building]] </p>
<p>The University has a Students' Union, the  <a>University of Bristol Union</a>, which claims to have the largest Students' Union building in the country.  From this location, the student radio station <em><a>BURST</a></em> (Bristol University Radio Station) broadcasts and the student paper <em><a>Epigram</a></em> has its office. In terms of student life, the Union is responsible for the organisation of the annual freshers' fair, the coordination of Bristol Student Community Action, which organizes volunteering projects in the local community, and the organization of entertainment events and student societies. Previous presidents have included <a>Sue Lawley</a> and former <a>Liberal Democrat</a> MP <a>Lembit &#x00d6;pik</a>. There is a separate union for postgraduate students, as well as an athletic union, which is a member of the <a>British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport</a>. In distinction to the '<a>blues</a>' awarded for sporting excellence at <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>, Bristol's outstanding athletes are awarded 'reds'.</p>
<h2>Halls of residence</h2>
<p></p>
<p>[[Image:Wills Hall, University of Bristol.JPG|thumb|[[Wills Hall]]]]</p>
<p>Accommodation for students is primarily in the central precinct of the University and two areas of Bristol: <a>Clifton</a> and <a>Stoke Bishop</a>. In Stoke Bishop, <a>Wills Hall</a> on the edge of the <a>Clifton Downs</a> was the first to be opened, in 1929, by then-Chancellor Winston Churchill. Its original <a>quadrangle</a> layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called <a>Hiatt Baker Hall</a>, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the University. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was <a>University Hall</a>, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992. It is a popular location for filming, with <em><a>The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>, <em><a>The House of Eliott</a></em> and <em><a>Truly, Madly, Deeply</a></em>, as well as episodes of <em><a>Only Fools and Horses</a></em> and <em><a>Casualty</a></em>, being filmed there. The <a>Grotto</a> in the grounds is a Grade I <a>listed building</a>. <a>Clifton Hill House</a> is another Grade I listed building now used as student accommodation in Clifton. It was originally built in between 1745 and 1750 by <a>Isaac Ware</a>, and has been used by the University since its earliest days in 1909. <a>Manor Hall</a> comprises five separate buildings, the principal of which was erected from 1927&#x2013;1932 to the design of <a>George Oatley</a> following a donation from <a>Henry Herbert Wills</a>.[[Image:Clifton Hill House.jpg|thumb|[[Clifton Hill House]]]]  One of its annexes, Manor House, has recently been refurbished and officially 'reopened' in 1999. Goldney Hall has beautiful gardens and modern accommodation complexes, whilst Clifton Hill House's accommodation is much smaller and far less attractive. Manor Hall houses the largest and most dated rooms, some dating back to the early 20th century. The hall's gardens are breathtakingly attractive, and complement what is a historically beautiful hall.</p>
<p>Several of the residences in the central precinct are more recent and have been built and are managed by third-party organisations under exclusivity arrangements with the University. These include Unite House and <a>Chantry Court</a>, opened in 2000 and 2003 respectively by the <a>UNITE Group</a>, as well as Dean's Court (2001, postgraduates only) and Woodland Court (2005), both run by the Dominion Housing Group.</p>

<p><img> <img></p>
<h3>Degrees</h3>
<p>Bristol awards a range of <a>academic degree</a>s spanning <a>bachelor's</a> and <a>master's</a> degrees as well as junior <a>doctorate</a>s and <a>higher doctorate</a>s. The <a>postnominals</a> awarded are the <a>degree abbreviations</a> used commonly among British universities. The University is part of the <a>Engineering Doctorate</a> scheme, and awards the Eng. D. in <a>systems engineering</a>, <a>engineering management</a>, <a>aerospace engineering</a> and <a>non-destructive evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>Bristol notably does not award by title any Bachelor's degrees in music, which is available for study but awarded <a>B.A.</a> (although it does award <a>M.Mus.</a> and <a>D.Mus.</a>), nor any degree in <a>divinity</a>, since divinity is not available for study (students of <a>theology</a> are awarded a <a>B.A.</a>). Similarly, the University does not award <a>B.Litt.</a> (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both <a>M.Litt.</a> and <a>D.Litt</a>. In regulations, the University does not name <a>M.D.</a> or <a>D.D.S.</a> as <a>higher doctorate</a>s, although they are in many universities. as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.</p>
<p>The degrees of D.Litt., <a>D.Sc.</a>, <a>D.Eng.</a>, <a>LL.D.</a> and D.Mus., whilst having regulations specifying the grounds for award, are most often conferred as <a>honorary degree</a>s (<em>in honoris causa</em>). Those used most commonly are the D.Litt., D.Sc. and LL.D., with the <a>M.A.</a> (and occasionally the M.Litt.) also sometimes conferred honorarily for distinction in the local area or within the University.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p> In common with most UK universities, Bristol is headed formally by the <a>Chancellor</a>, currently <a>Brenda Hale</a> and led on a day-to-day basis by the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>, currently Prof <a>Eric Thomas</a>. There are four Pro-Vice-Chancellors and three ceremonial Pro-Chancellors. The Chancellor may hold office for up to ten years and the Pro-Chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the Vice-Chancellor and Pro-Vice-Chancellors have no term limits. From September 2008, there will also be a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, who will stand in for the Vice-Chancellor on all matters when the latter is away from the University.</p>
<p>Responsibility for running the University is held at an executive level by the Vice-Chancellor, but the Council is the only body that can recommend changes to the University's statutes and Charter, with the exception of academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the Senate, the chief academic body in the University which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The Chancellor and Pro Chancellors are nominated by Council and appointed formally by Court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of Council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the University, returns 100 members to Court and one member to Council,]] --&gt;  Some of the University of Bristol's buildings date to its pre-charter days when it was <a>University College Bristol</a>. These buildings were designed by <a>Charles Hansom</a>, the younger brother of <a>Joseph Hansom</a>, the inventor of the <a>Hansom Cab</a>. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the University and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the University <a>Henry Overton Wills</a>. It was requested to the architect <a>George Oatley</a>  that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of <a>Park Street</a> suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic <a>Roger Gill</a> has stated that the building is &quot;remarkable in size&quot; but noted that the &quot;ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking&quot;. He goes on to criticize the building as a &quot;sham&quot; and a &quot;folly&quot;. The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The <a>Tyndalls Park</a> Estate and <a>Royal Fort House</a> were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the University to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.</p>
<p><a>Goldney gardens</a> entered the property of the University of Bristol through <a>George Wills</a> who had hoped to build an all male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hall House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor  <a>Conwy Lloyd Morgan</a>. Eventually land was purchased in <a>Stoke Bishop</a> allowing <a>Wills Hall</a> to be bought, allowing the building of what has been described as a &quot;quasi-<a>Oxbridge</a>&quot; hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel added by George Wills' widow after his death. <a>thumb|left|200px|The Gardens of Goldney Hall were acquired by the Wills family</a>. Burwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the <a>Avon Gorge</a> was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of <a>Sir George Oatley</a>. The building is now used to house the Centre for Continuing Education.</p>
<p>Many of the more modern buildings including the Physics department and Senate House were designed by <a>Raplh Brentnall</a> after funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realize that is an extension to the original building. Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the <a>Bristol Blitz</a> of <a>World War II</a>. The buildings of St Michael's Hill were rebuilt using hundreds of old <a>photographs</a> in order to recreate the original houses. The flats at Goldney Hall were designed by Michael Grice and received an award from the Civic Trust for their design. Bristol University owns some of the best examples of Georgian architecture in the city, the best examples being <a>Royal Fort House</a>, <a>Clifton Hill House</a> and <a>Goldney Hall</a> despite some additions. The Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department were design by <a>Charles Dyer</a> and is seen as a good example of a Greek revival movement in British architecture. The <a>tympanum</a> of the building depicts a scene from <em>The Advent of Morning</em> designed by <a>Jabez Tyley</a>. Its major feature was a large organ which has since been destroyed by fire.</p>
<h2>Symbols</h2>
<p>In common with other universities in the United Kingdom, Bristol uses its particular pattern of <a>academic dress</a> as well its logo and <a>coat of arms</a> to represent itself.</p>
<h3>Academic dress</h3>
<p> The University specifies a mix of <a>Cambridge</a> and <a>Oxford</a> <a>academic dress</a>. For the most part, it uses Cambridge-style hoods and Oxford-style gowns. Unusually for British universities, the hoods are required to be 'University red' (see the logo at the top of the page) rather than black.</p>
<h3>Logo and arms</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The University coat of arms</a> In 2004, the University unveiled its new logo. The icons in the logo are the sun for the Wills family, the dolphin for Colston, the horse for Fry and the ship-and-castle from the mediaeval seal of the City of Bristol, as also used in the coat of arms. The shape of the whole logo represents the open book of learning. This logo has replaced the University <a>arms</a> shown, but the arms continue to be used where there is a specific historical or ceremonial requirement. The arms comprise: &lt;center&gt; <em>argent on a cross quadrate gules the arms of the City of Bristol between in pale and a sun in splendour (for Wills) and an open book proper, leaved and clasped or, and inscribed with the words Nisi quia Dominus, and in fesse to the dexter a dolphin embowed (for Colston), and to the sinister a horse courant (for Fry), both of the third.</em> &lt;/center&gt; The inscription on the book is the <a>Latin</a> opening of the 124th Psalm, <em>&quot;If the Lord Himself had not (been on our side...)&quot;</em>.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Bristol has produced nine <a>Nobel Laureate</a>s and academics include ten Fellows of the <a>Academy of Medical Sciences</a>, ten Fellows of the <a>British Academy</a>, twelve Fellows of the <a>Royal Academy of Engineering</a> and eighteen Fellows of the <a>Royal Society</a>.</p>
<p>Present academics include Sir <a>Michael Berry</a>, knighted in 1996, one of the discoverers of <a>quantum mechanics</a>' '<a>geometric phase</a>', <a>John Rarity</a> who, in 2001, set a then world-record 1.9&nbsp;km range for free-space secure key exchange using <a>quantum cryptography</a>, and <a>Mark Horton</a>, one of the presenters of the <a>BBC</a>'s <em><a>Coast</a></em> television series. <a>Patricia Broadfoot</a>, Vice-Chancellor of the <a>University of Gloucestershire</a>, and <a>Nigel Thrift</a>, Vice-Chancellor of the <a>University of Warwick</a> both were previously faculty at Bristol. <a>Anthony Epstein</a>, co-discoverer of the <a>Epstein-Barr virus</a>, was Professor of <a>Pathology</a> at the University from 1968&#x2013;1982. Historical academics include Sir <a>John Lennard-Jones</a>, discoverer of the <a>Lennard-Jones potential</a> in physics and <a>Alfred Marshall</a>, one of the University College's Principals and influential <a>economist</a> in the latter part of the 19th century.</p>
