<p>The <strong>University of the Pacific</strong> (<strong>UOP</strong> or <strong>Pacific</strong>) is a private university in <a>Stockton, California</a>, <a>United States</a>, originally affiliated with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>. First chartered on July 10, 1851, in <a>Santa Clara</a> under the name <strong>California Wesleyan College</strong>, it later moved to <a>San Jose</a> before settling on its current location in California's <a>Central Valley</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>Pacific is the oldest chartered university in California. University of the Pacific is also the home of <a>K-PAC</a> Student Radio and student-run newspaper <em>The Pacifican</em>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pacific was founded on July 10, 1851, in <a>Santa Clara</a> as <strong>California Wesleyan College</strong>. In 1858, the college opened the first medical school on the <a>West Coast</a>. The medical school later became part of <a>Stanford</a> and is now <a>California Pacific Medical Center</a>. </p>
<p>In 1871, the campus was moved to <a>San Jose</a> and the college opened its doors to women, becoming the first independent co-educational campus in California. In 1896, Napa College merged with the college. In 1911, the name was changed to <strong>College of the Pacific</strong> (<strong>COP</strong>).</p>
<p>In 1925, the campus relocated from the <a>Bay Area</a> to the <a>Central Valley</a> city of Stockton; it became the University of the Pacific in 1961.</p>
<p>In 1962, Pacific merged with the <a>San Francisco College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> (established in 1896 in <a>San Francisco</a>), and then in 1966, with the <a>McGeorge School of Law</a> (established in 1924 in <a>Sacramento</a>). In the late 1960s, the university separated from the United Methodist Church, when &#x201c;federal law about public funding of church-related institutions became an issue.&#x201d; </p>
<p>In May 2007, the university announced an estate gift of $100 million from Robert C. and Jeannette Powell. The gift was unusual in its size for an institution like Pacific that is not primarily research-focused. Only 29 universities throughout the world received a larger gift in the prior 40 years.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Burns Tower on the Stockton campus</a>The Stockton campus, featuring a tower, rose gardens, architectural columns, brick-faced buildings, and numerous trees, was used in <a>Hollywood</a> films, due to its aesthetic likeness to East Coast <a>Ivy League</a> universities: <em><a>Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>, <em><a>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em>, <em><a>The Sure Thing</a></em>, <em><a>Dead Man on Campus</a></em>, and <em><a>Dreamscape</a></em>, among others<em>.</em></p>
<p>The Stockton campus is home to three main <a>residential halls</a>: Grace Covell Hall, Southwest Hall, and the Quad Buildings. The Quads are composed of several separate smaller residence halls in close proximity to each other. Grace Covell is the largest residence hall on campus holding more than 350 students while Southwest and the Quads hold a lower number of students. Upperclassmen can find housing in the University Townhouses on the northeast side of campus or in the two apartment buildings known as Monagan and Brookside Hall.</p>
<p>In 2008, the university opened a new University Center, at a cost of &gt;$9000, to centralize all campus student-centered activities. This University Center houses a new central dining hall, student cafe, pub, bookstore and conference centers, replacing the McCaffrey Center. It also built a new $20 million Biological Sciences Center in 2008 that provides advanced classroom and laboratory facilities for students studying the natural sciences and the health sciences.</p>
<p>The campus is home to <a>Morris Chapel</a>, a non-denominational church with simple architecture, excellent acoustics and photogenic backdrops.</p>
<h3>Campus sustainability efforts</h3>
<p>The university strives to promote environmental responsibility. Students are given opportunities to take part in sustainability service projects through the M.O.V.E. (Mountains, Ocean, Valley Experience) program. The on-campus dining services participates in the Farm to Fork Program, buying food locally where feasible. In 2009 students from the Residence for Earth &amp; Environmental Living &amp; Learning (a campus residential <a>learning community</a>), the Students for Environmental Action, and the Department of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences designed and implemented the &#x201c;Tap That&#x201d; campaign, whose goal was to inform students, faculty and staff about the effects of disposable water bottles on the environment. Pacific's sustainability score was a D in 2009 and has risen to a C since then.</p>

<p>, the Stockton campus had 4,646 students (3,470 undergraduates, 535 graduate, 641 First professional students). Approximately 83% are from California; the rest are from 43 other states and 42 other countries.</p>
