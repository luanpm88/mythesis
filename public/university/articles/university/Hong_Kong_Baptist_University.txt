<p>    <strong>Hong Kong Baptist University</strong> (HKBU) () is a publicly-funded tertiary institution with a <a>Christian</a> education heritage. It is the sole surviving institution of 13 major Christian universities that once operated on the China mainland.</p>
<p>Founded in 1956 by the Baptist Convention of Hong Kong, HKBU is the second-oldest institution of higher learning in <a>Hong Kong</a>. It was established as <strong>Hong Kong Baptist College</strong> with the support of American Baptists, who provided both operating and construction funds and personnel to the school in its early years.</p>
<p>It became Hong Kong Baptist University in 1994 during the presidency of Dr. Daniel C.W. TSE, <a>LLD</a>, <a>GBS</a>, <a>CBE</a>, <a>JP</a>, who succeeded the Founding President, Dr. Lam Chi-fung, as the second president of the University in 1971.</p>
<p>Upon the retirement of Dr. Tse in 2001 after 30 years of educational and social services to the University and Hong Kong, Prof. <a>Ng Ching-fai</a> GBS was appointed as the third president of the University. The chairman of the University Council and Court is Mr. <a>WONG Ying-wai, Wilfred</a>. In 2010, Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi assumed office as the fourth president of HKBU.</p>
<p>HKBU has four main campuses: <em>Ho Sin Hang Campus</em> (1966), <em>Shaw Campus</em> (1995), <em>Baptist University Road Campus</em> (1998) and the &quot;<em>Kai Tak Campus</em>&quot; (2005), as well as the <em>Shek Mun Campus</em> (2006) for the College of International Education and the Hong Kong Baptist University Affiliated School Wong Kam Fai Secondary and Primary School.  The first three campuses are located in the urban heart of <a>Kowloon Tong</a>, while the &quot;Kai Tak Campus&quot; is on Kwun Tong Road and the <em>Shek Mun Campus</em> in <a>Shatin</a>.</p>
<p>Combined enrollment on these campuses is currently more than 8,500.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Baptist University is ranked <strong>111th in the world</strong> and <strong>13th in Asia</strong> by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> 2010. </p>
<h2>Emblem &amp; Logo</h2>
<h3>Emblem</h3>
<p>The <a>emblem</a> of Hong Kong Baptist University consists of three pictorial elements: the Bible, waves and knots.</p>
<p>The <a>Bible</a> symbolises the unique quality of <a>Christian</a> <a>education</a> which includes moral and spiritual training in addition to academic education.</p>
<p>The waves, on the other hand, symbolise both Hong Kong's geographic nature as an island while echoing Confucius' dictum that &quot;the wise love water&quot; and the University's continuing effort to improve its educational quality.</p>
<p>The knots, the final symbol, illustrate that within God's embrace, Christians are harmoniously linked and loved.</p>
<h3>Logo</h3>
<p>The logo, embodying a book and water motifs, was adopted after the institution was granted its <a>university</a> status in 1994. The acronym &quot;BU&quot; coupled with the outlined book on the logo resembles the Chinese characters of welcome and progress, conceptualising the merging of eastern and western cultures.</p>
<p>The design of the logo was commended at a design competition held in October 1996. The Hong Kong Designers Association awarded a Certificate of Merit at the Design 96 Show to Kan &amp; Lau Design Consultants for creating the logo.</p>

<h2>Academic Community Hall</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Academic Community Hall</a></p>
<p>Academic Community Hall is an <a>auditorium</a> located in the university. It opened in May, 1978, and its <a>seating capacity</a> is 1,346. Originally, the first President and founder of the University, Dr. Lam Chi-fung, conceived the idea of building a hall for University functions. In 1970, on the occasion of their Golden Wedding Anniversary, Dr. and Mrs. Lam donated half a million dollars towards the construction of the auditorium. A local architect, Eric Cumine, took charge of the project. However, Dr. Lam died the following year before the project got underway.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors decided to honour Dr. Lam by expanding the planned auditorium into a much larger scale project --- the development of the Lam Chi-fung Memorial Building. As a part of the project, the Academic Community Hall would serve as a cultural centre for the University and its surrounding community, thus providing a direct link between town and gown.</p>
<p>At present, the Lam Chi-fung Memorial Building consists of an auditorium, a lobby, a VIP room and some display areas. The auditorium was the venue to a concert by <a>The Clash</a> on 25 February 1982, which was marred by fighting in the crowd.</p>
<h2>University Library</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Baptist University Library is made up by a Main Library and a number of branches.

<p>The Chinese Medicine Library is located on the second floor of the Chinese Medicine Building. Its set up aims to meet the growing information demand in the development of Chinese medicine. The European Documentation Centre is located in David C. Lam Building 803A and is open to the public. It provides an important study and research base for European Studies.
