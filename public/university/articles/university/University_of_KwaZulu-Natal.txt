<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Freedom of expression</h3>
<p>In 2006 the <a>International Freedom of Expression Exchange</a> stated that &quot;Free expression and academic freedom are in severe decline at the university.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2007 the Freedom of Expression Institute was concerned about the university's  suspension of professor <a>Evan Mantzaris</a> for criticising management, &quot;part of a larger process in which the space for free expression and academic freedom at that university is being narrowed&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2008 the <a>London Review of Books</a> stated that the University &quot;is in vertiginous decline&quot;</p>
<p>In 2008 Education Minister <a>Naledi Pandor</a> wanted to meet vice-chancellor <a>Malegapuru Makgoba</a> and discuss resignations of staff over expression concerns, and the condemnation from <a>Cosatu</a> and the Freedom of Expression Institute for the punishment of academics.</p>
<h3>Staff strike</h3>

<p>UKZN academics Fazel Khan and Sally Giles directed a documentary film about <a>Abahlali baseMjondolo</a>, a shack-dwellers' movement. When Kahn was excised from both the photo and text in an article about the documentary in the university newsletter <em>UKZNdaba</em>, he was charged with dishonest conduct because he told newspapers that he believed that he had been excised from the photograph and text by the university management due to his role in the staff strike of 2006. Khan was found guilty of bringing the university into disrepute and fired. The Mercury had previously reported that vice-chancellor Makgoba had publicly declared that, following a request from Mayor <a>Obed Mlaba</a>, he would charge Khan and 2 other academics working with Abahlali baseMjondolo for 'incitement'. Khan is currently suing the university for unfair dismissal.</p>
