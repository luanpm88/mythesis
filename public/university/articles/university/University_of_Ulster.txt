<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Ulster</strong> (Formerly shortened to <strong>UU</strong>; ) is a multi-campus, coeducational <a>university</a> located in <a>Northern Ireland</a>. It is the largest single university in <a>Ireland</a>, discounting the federal <a>National University of Ireland</a>. UU was established in 1968 as the <em>New University of Ulster</em> and can trace its roots back to 1845 when <em>Magee College</em> was established in Derry and 1849, when the <em>School of Art and Design</em> was inaugurated in Belfast. The university incorporated its four campuses in 1984 under the UU banner; these are located in <a>Belfast</a>, <a>Coleraine</a> (site of the administrative headquarters), <a>Magee College</a> in <a>Derry</a>, and <a>Jordanstown</a>. A fifth <a>distance learning</a> campus, <em>Campus One</em>, delivers online programmes; mainly at <a>graduate level</a>.</p>
<p>Ulster is a member of the <a>Association of Commonwealth Universities</a> , the <a>European University Association</a>, <a>Universities Ireland</a> and <a>Universities UK</a>. High demand for places and a thriving development programme contributed to a record number of applications in 2004-05 to keep the University of Ulster in the top 10 of the UK's most popular universities.  The University of Ulster was shortlisted for the <a>Sunday Times University of the Year</a> award in 2001.</p>
<p>The university has one of the highest further study and/or employment rates in the UK, with 95% of graduates being in work or undertaking further study six months after they have completed their degree .  In the field of <a>biomedical sciences</a>, UU obtained a 5* rating, as well as being ranked joint first in the UK, following the Research Assessment Exercise in 2001. 86% of research activity at the university has been rated in the 2008 RAE as being of international quality, with 20% being classified as world-leading. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The New University of Ulster incorporated <a>Magee College</a> founded in 1865 in <a>Derry</a>. Magee College was a college of the <a>Royal University of Ireland</a> from 1880 and later became associated with the <a>University of Dublin</a> (better known as Trinity College) when the Royal University was dissolved in 1908 and replaced by the <a>National University of Ireland</a>. In 1953 Magee College broke its links with Dublin and became <em>Magee University College</em>. It was hoped that this <a>university college</a> would become Northern Ireland's second university after The <a>Queen's University of Belfast</a>. However, this did not happen and instead it was subsumed into the New University, primarily as a result of the unwillingness of the <a>Unionist</a> government at <a>Stormont</a> to have the second university sited in overwhelmingly <a>nationalist</a> Derry, in which <a>&quot;The Troubles&quot;</a> were just beginning to break out. The decision caused an outcry at the time . The University incorporate the campus site of the former Ulster Polytechnic in 1984. This was the first, and as of 2010 only, merger in <a>UK</a> <a>higher education</a> whereby what is now called a <a>plate glass university</a> merged with what would now be a <a>post-1992 university</a>.</p>

<h2>Academic</h2>
<p>The University's course provision is the largest in Northern Ireland, covering arts, business, engineering, information technology, life and health sciences, management, and social sciences. Courses have a strong <a>vocational</a> element and the majority include a period of industrial or professional placement.</p>
<p>The University of Ulster has a strong reputation for innovation. In order to create new pathways into higher education the University of Ulster initiated its Online Distance Learning (ODL) project called Campus One.  The Campus One programme provides an alternative mode of study, with a range of courses available online to students all over the world. Campus One courses range from full <a>postgraduate</a> programmes, professional development and continuing development courses; through to short business-focused courses all offered over the Internet.</p>
<p>The University contributes a higher than national average to local research and development activity and has a strategic research focus.</p>
<p>The University of Ulster is particularly strong in the field of biomedical sciences, and a Centre for Molecular Biosciences (located at Coleraine) is one of the major projects developed by the University. The Biomedical Sciences department obtained 5* ratings as well as being joint first in the UK, following the UK &#x2013; wide <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE) in 2001. It was the only UK university to retain a 5* rating for biomedical sciences in the 2001 RAE - part of a performance that saw significant improvement and consolidation of the 1996 results. A 5* research rating was also awarded in the field of Celtic studies. The University performed strongly in the 2008 RAE. Full details of Ulster's RAE results are available at <a>http://research.ulster.ac.uk/rae/rae2008.html</a></p>
<p>The University is a leading partner in the Northern Ireland Science Park development, with Science Park sites at the <a>Coleraine</a> and Magee campuses, and in Belfast. There are also Innovation Centres at Coleraine and Magee which provide incubation support to developing spin-out and spin-in companies.</p>

<h3>Coleraine</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Coleraine campus (UUC) is the administration headquarters of the University and is the most traditional in outlook, with a focus on science and the humanities. The traditional focus is primarily as a result of it always being a university campus as opposed to the more vocational type courses offered at the polytechnic at Jordanstown. The Coleraine campus includes the only optometry school in Northern Ireland and is indeed one of only two on the island of Ireland.  2009 will see the University launch a new Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) course at Coleraine. The campus includes the Riverside Theatre, the third-largest professional theatre in Northern Ireland.  The Coleraine campus is situated on the banks of the River Bann with views to the North Coast and County Donegal hills.</p>
<h5>Portrush Site</h5>
<p>The Portrush site was part of the Coleraine Campus and home to the School of Hotel, Leisure and Tourism. <a>Portrush</a> is a town east of Coleraine on the North Coast of <a>Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>The Portrush Campus closed in 2008 and courses were relocated to the Coleraine and the newly developed Belfast campuses.</p>
<h3>Jordanstown</h3>

The  Jordanstown campus is set in a leafy suburb approximately seven miles (11&nbsp;km) from Belfast city centre and situated at the foot of the Antrim Hills overlooking Belfast Lough. UUJ is home to the Sports Institute for Northern Ireland and has a range of Sports facilities including a new high performance centre. The Buildings are mostly situated around a central Mall with on-site stores and services.  A number of high-demand undergraduate courses at UUJ have extremely high entry requirements such as Physiotherapy, Communication Advertising and Marketing (CAM), Speech and Language Therapy, Law, Sport and Exercise Science/Sports Studies and Radiography.</p>

<h3>Magee</h3>
<p> The Magee campus (UUM) in Derry is a mixture of historic and new buildings in a Victorian residential area of the city. It was named after Martha Magee and opened in 1865 as a <a>presbyterian</a> Christian arts and <a>theological college</a>. Today, it has no religious affiliation and provides a broad range of <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> degree programmes in disciplines ranging from <a>computer science</a>, <a>computer games</a> and <a>robotics</a> to <a>psychology</a> and <a>nursing</a>, as well as research excellence with the Intelligent Systems Research Centre located there.  The campus is within walking distance to the shopping and entertainment districts and is serviced by transport links.  Since 1984, development of the university has focused on the expansion of the Magee campus. ]]</p>
<h3>Ballyronan, &lt;small&gt;Ballymaguigan&lt;/small&gt;</h3>
<p>The University of Ulster formally had a base named, 'The University of Ulster Freshwater Laboratory' in a small townland called <a>Ballymaguigan</a> in the village of <a>Ballyronan</a>, outside the town of <a>Magherafelt</a> in <a>County Londonderry</a>. </p>
<p>The Freshwater Laboratory, despite not a campus was a base of the University and consisted of on-campus accommodation, classrooms and testing labs. Courses offererd were 0all based on studying agriculture, wildlife in<a>Lough Neagh</a>, water testing and other aquactic courses. </p>
<p>The base closed around ten years ago, and still remains standing, the buildings and on-site accommodation is in a run down state and was recently bought by <a>Magherafelt District Council</a>. </p>
<p>The remaining site is located on the edge of Lough Neagh, down the Point Road in Ballymaguigan. The area today has become popular with the locals for camping, fishing and boating.</p>
<h3>Campus One</h3>
<p>Campus One, the Virtual Campus of the University of Ulster, was launched on 8 October 2001. It represents a revolutionary new route to learning via the World Wide Web and was selected by the <a>European Commission</a> to deliver <a>World's First Higher Educational Programme in Hydrogen Safety Engineering</a>. Campus One, a 'University at Your Fingertips', provides an online portal through which all of the University of Ulster's e-learning courses are made available on a global scale. The virtual campus incorporates existing e-learning courses with new post and undergraduate programmes, all of which can be accessed and completed via Campus One from anywhere in the world. Campus One is the first e-learning network of its kind in the UK and Ireland, and has been developed in association with academic partners in the USA and Hong Kong, ensuring its e-learning programmes to have global reach and relevance.</p>
