<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of York</strong> (informally <strong>York University</strong>, or simply <strong>York</strong>, occasionally abbreviated as <strong><em>Ebor.</em></strong> for post-nominals), is an academic institution located in the city of <a>York</a>, <a>England</a>. Established in 1963, the campus university has expanded to more than thirty departments and centres, covering a wide range of subjects. In 2003 it attracted the highest research income per capita of any UK university . The university has built a reputation in less than half a century that places it among the top 20 universities in Europe, and the top 90 universities in the world, according to the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>. In the last <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> in 2008, York was also named as the 8th best research institution in the <a>United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The University attracts a student body with a wide range of backgrounds, including a large number of internationals and a relatively high number of state school students in comparison to other well-ranked universities according to <a>The Times</a> <a>Good University Guide</a>. Situated to the east of the city of <a>York</a>, the university campus is approximately  in size, incorporating the York Science Park and the <a>National Science Learning Centre</a>. Priding itself on its wildlife, renowned campus lakes and greenery, the institution also occupies buildings in the historic city of York. Every student is allocated to one of the university's eight colleges, as is the case at the traditional <a>collegiate Universities</a> of <a>Oxford</a>, <a>Cambridge</a> and <a>Durham</a>. In May 2007 the university was granted permission to build an extension to its main campus, on arable land just east of the nearby village of <a>Heslington</a>. The land was removed from the <a>green belt</a> especially for the purpose of extending the university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The Yorkshire Philosophical society</a> The first petition for the establishment of a university in York was presented to King James I in 1617.  In 1903 <a>F. J. Munby</a> and others (including the <a>Yorkshire Philosophical Society</a>) proposed a 'Victoria University of Yorkshire'. The then <a>College of Ripon and York St John</a> also at one time considered purchasing <a>Heslington Hall</a> as part of a proposed new campus.</p>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>Oliver Sheldon (1894&#x2013;1951), co-founder of York Civic Trust, was a driving force behind the founding of the University, according to the <a>Borthwick Institute for Archives</a>. The University of York was opened in 1963, admitting 200 students. At the time, the university consisted of three buildings, principally the historic <a>King's Manor</a> in the city centre and <a>Heslington Hall</a>, which has Tudor foundations and is in the village of Heslington on the edge of York. A year later, work began on purpose-built structures on the Heslington Campus (see below), which now forms the main part of the university.</p>
<h3>Founding principles</h3>
<p><a>Baron James of Rusholme</a>, the university's first Vice-Chancellor, said of the University of York that &quot;it must be collegiate in character, that it must deliberately seek to limit the number of subjects and that much of the teaching must be done via <a>tutorials</a> and <a>seminars</a>&quot;. Due to the influence of Professor <a>Graeme Moodie</a>, founding head of the Politics Department, students are involved in the governance of the university at all levels, and his model has since been widely adopted.</p>

  <li><a>Professor Sir Ronald Cooke</a> (1993&#x2013;2002)</li>
  <li><a>Professor Brian Cantor</a> (2002&#x2013;Present) The Sunday Times said, &quot;York is one of Britain's academic success stories, forging a reputation to rival Oxford and Cambridge in the space of 40 years. In some regards &#x2014; teaching, for example &#x2014; it has a recent track record better than that of Oxford, according to the official assessments of teaching quality.&quot;</p>
<p>On 25 November 2010 York was named &quot;University of the Year&quot; at the Times Higher Education Awards, achieving praise from the judges for its &quot;success in combining academic excellence with social inclusion, as well as its record in scientific discovery&quot;.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Heslington West campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|130px|Central Hall</a> In 1964, work began on the campus facilities in the grounds of Heslington Hall. The marshy land was drained, the winding lake which dominates the campus was built, and the area was landscaped. The original buildings were designed by <a>architect</a> Andrew Derbyshire, and assembled using the <a>CLASP</a> system of <a>prefabricated</a> construction, hence York's inclusion among the so-called <a>plate glass universities</a>. The buildings are connected by numerous covered walkways and bridges. Most of the university's arts departments occupy premises in the college buildings, while many of the science departments have their own buildings.</p>
<p>A landmark building is Central Hall, a half-octagonal concert hall used for convocations and examinations, as well as theatrical and musical performances. It has played host to <a>The Wailers</a>, <a>George Melly</a>, <a>Soft Machine</a>, <a>Pink Floyd</a>, and <a>Paul McCartney</a>. Performances by big-name acts have been rarer at the university following a 1985 <a>The Boomtown Rats</a> concert, during which the cover of the <a>orchestra pit</a> was damaged. A ban on pop performances, and in particular dancing, in Central Hall was imposed by the university, although it has occasionally been relaxed. Central Hall is still used for classical concerts and, since a rock concert was held there in on 13 March 2010 it has been available again for full booking. It is going to be used as the location for the main Fresher Week event this year. Public concerts are regularly held in the music department's <a>Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall</a>, the <a>Arthur Sykes Rymer Auditorium</a> and in some of the colleges. The Raymond Burton Library was also recently nominated for a SCONUL Design award.</p>
<p>The campus lake, which is the largest plastic-bottomed lake in Europe, has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild <a>waterfowl</a>. These include <a>greylag</a>, <a>Canada</a>, <a>barnacle</a> and <a>snow geese</a>, <a>coot</a>s, <a>moorhen</a>s and large numbers of <a>duck</a>s, including <a>mallard</a>s, <a>tufted duck</a>, and <a>common pochard</a>s. There is also a growing population of <a>black swan</a>s and a few <a>great crested grebe</a>. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence.</p>
<p>Other parts of the campus support a large <a>rabbit</a> population. On at least one occasion, students have been cautioned by the University for hunting rabbits.</p>
<p>The Heslington campus has both indoor and outdoor sports facilities, including an all weather astroturf pitch and County standard cricket pitch. A large, tent-like structure allows for indoor sport, gymnastics and dance.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>King's Manor</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|150px|left|The King's Manor Library in summer</a> Located in <a>York</a> city centre, approximately three miles (5&nbsp;km) from the main Heslington campus, the historic King's Manor began as the Abbot's House of <a>St Mary's Abbey</a> and went on to become the headquarters of the <a>Council of the North</a> following the <a>dissolution of the monasteries</a>. It is home to the Archaeology, Medieval Studies and Eighteenth Century Studies departments, and is regularly used by other related departments such as History. It has a public restaurant and is used for art displays.</p>
<p>Not far from the King's Manor is the Minster Library, in Dean's Park.  Students and staff of the University are able to use the Minster Library, which shares staff and cataloguing with the main University library, and holds the huge collection of early books belonging to the Dean and Chapter of <a>York Minster</a>.</p>
<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p>There are eight colleges at the University of York, and every student is a member of a college. Staff may choose to join a college if they wish. All the colleges are of equal status, but each has its own constitution. The day-to-day running of the colleges is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's Provost. Each college has a Junior Common Room for students, which is managed by the elected Junior Common Room Committee, and a Senior Common Room, which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The colleges are deliberately assigned undergraduates, postgraduate students and staff from a wide mixture of disciplines. and to introduce a number of new subjects.  The <a>Law</a> School and the Department of <a>Theatre</a>, <a>Film</a> and <a>Television</a> studies recruited their first students for the 2008-9 academic year. Departments of <a>Pharmacy</a> and <a>Dentistry</a> are planned. These intentions are based upon calculations of expansion of university numbers nationally, and a re-targeting of the University's assets. For most of its history, the core strengths of the university were regarded as the departments of technology (Physics, Computer Science, Electronics), the departments of social and political sciences (Social Policy and Social Work, Sociology, Politics, School of PPE) and the departments of traditional <a>liberal arts</a> (History, English). Successes in cancer research lead to a re-structuring of the Chemistry and Biology departments to bring them closer together, the founding of a Health Sciences department, the establishment of courses in Nursing and Midwifery, and the creation of the <a>Hull York Medical School</a> or HYMS. This entry into medical and health care training has led to a change in the University's priorities.</p>
<p>On the arts side, the university is building upon its reputation for fostering interdisciplinary studies. The <a>Centre for Medieval Studies</a> has been regarded as at the forefront of combining history, art history, archaeology, literary studies, architectural studies and drama to give a more rounded view of historical events and culture. This model has been successfully replicated with the establishment of the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies. The opening of the <a>Centre for Renaissance and Early Modern Studies</a> was in 2007, admitting the first postgraduate students in 2008. At the same time, the Department of English and Related Literature intends to expand upon its literary studies by placing more emphasis on creative writing and performance linked to the new Department for Theatre, Film and Television. The university's Chancellor <a>Greg Dyke</a> has funded a professorship in the new Department of Theatre, Film and Television. On 6 November 2007 an Institute for Effective Education was launched, to improve knowledge of teaching and learning processes and promote the most effective.</p>
<p>For a number of years, the university's expansion plans have been limited by planning restrictions on the Heslington campus. The City of York planning conditions stipulate that only 20% of the land may be built upon, to retain its character. The campus is currently at 19.8% of capacity, so the addition of a new Humanities and Education Research Centre, called the Berrick Saul building, is on 'brownfield' land.</p>
<p>In 2003-04, plans were finalised for a 70 hectare extension to the campus, provisionally called <em>Heslington East</em>, designed to mirror the existing Heslington West campus. This will be built on <a>arable land</a> between Grimston Bar <a>park and ride</a> car park and Heslington village. After a lengthy consultation and a <a>public inquiry</a> into the proposals in 2006, the <a>Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</a> gave the go-ahead in May 2007.</p>
<p>Designs are progressing for the site and for the new buildings, and on 14 May 2008 the City of York planners approved the design for the first residential college, Goodricke. In the York <em>Press</em> of 28 July 2008 Shepherd Construction was named as the builder of the first building.  The current proposal includes landscaping the whole area, constructing a lake with marsh borders, planting light woodland and many specimen trees, and maximising biodiversity. Several departments will move to new, purpose-built facilities on the extension, with Law and the York Management School being the first, in one building. Heslington East will be connected to the existing campus by a network of pathways and light transport links. The university began construction in 2008, with the first buildings, including Goodricke college, coming into use in October 2009.</p>
<h3>Support for off-campus accommodation</h3>
<p>The University publishes an annual code of practice for student accommodation to help students living off-campus.</p>
<h3>Science Park and on-campus organisations</h3>
<p>Next door to the university on the York Science Park are organisations including the <a>Higher Education Academy</a>, the <a>Digital Preservation Coalition</a> the <a>National Non-Food Crops Centre</a>, the <a>York Neuroimaging Centre</a>, the <a>York JEOL Nanocentre</a>, the North Yorkshire office of <a>Natural England</a>, the UK head office of <a>AlphaGraphics</a>, and the Leeds, York &amp; North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h2>Entry standards</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Heslington Hall</a> Information for entry standards gathered from the 2005-2006 academic year by the HESA shows that the average student at the University of York achieved a UCAS tariff of 436. An A grade at A-Level is equivalent to 120 points, and an A at AS worth 60 points.grade the average entrant can be assumed to be achieving three or more A-Levels at grade A.</p>
<p>York has the 8th highest entrant UCAS points of British universities.</p>
<h2>Official teaching statistics</h2>
<p>The 2003 <a>QAA</a> report on the institution gave it the best of their three possible outcomes saying that &quot;broad confidence can be placed in the soundness of the university's current and likely future management of the quality of its academic programmes and the academic standards of its awards.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest Teaching Quality Assessment data for the University of York is listed below. In cases before November 1995 a numerical value, out of 24, is not used. In these cases &quot;Excellent&quot; is the highest possible grade followed by &quot;Satisfactory&quot; and then &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot;. Under the newer system the quality of teaching is marked out of 24. 22/24 or higher is equivalent to &quot;Excellent&quot; on the old scale  20 out of 23 departments gained an &quot;excellent&quot; rating.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Research assessment</h3>
<p>York has an impressive reputation for research with 19 Units of Assessment out of the 23 in the 2000 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> receiving a rating of 5 and three 5* (where 1 is the lowest and 5* is the highest possible) ratings in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise.  The Department of English and Related Literature and the Department of Computer Science were later upgraded from 5* to 6* (indicating successive 5* grades), and the Department of Psychology has been rated 6* for funding. Using these statistics, York was ranked the sixth-best research institution in the UK. The proportion of staff submitted as research active in each Unit of Assessment was above 80%. <a>thumb|right|Central Hall and lake</a> <a>thumb|right|The campus from the air looking south</a> </p>
<p>York is a founding member of the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a> which supports worldwide collaboration in teaching and research. The university has been awarded the <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a> four times - in 1997 for the work of the Department of Computer Science; in 2005 for the work of CNAP, the Centre for Novel Agricultural products which explores the potential from the biosphere to reduce the global economy's dependence on fossil reserves and fuel , in 2007 for the work of CHE (the Centre for <a>Health Economics</a> and in 2009 for the work of <a>Social Policy Research Unit</a> of the Department of Social Policy and Social Work. </p>
<p><a>Health economics</a> was pioneered at York and the university leads the world in the methodological development of cost-effectiveness analysis of health care technologies, is home to two prominent Health Economics journals and has been home to many prominent names in Health Economics (including current Lead Health Economist at the <a>World Bank</a> Adam Wagstaff, ex-deputy chair of <a>NICE</a> Tony Culyer, current ISPOR director Paul Kind, ex-ISPOR president Mike Drummond, current chairman of York <a>Primary Care Trust</a> Alan Maynard OBE, Andrew Briggs, Carl Klaxton, Mark Sculpher, Alan Williams, Peter C. Smith and Hugh Gravelle).</p>
<p>There are around eight applications for every undergraduate place, and a low dropout rate of 4% (only <a>Oxbridge</a>, <a>Bristol</a>, and <a>UCL</a> are lower).</p>
<p>In 2007 York became the only British University to have an academic department &#x2013; Chemistry &#x2013; win the Gold Athena Swan Award for its commitment to the careers of women in science. The Department of Psychology has won a Silver Athena Swan Award, the first in the country to do so, Biology also has silver, and the university as a whole holds the Athena Swan bronze award.</p>
<h3>League tables</h3>
<p>Traditionally regarded as a 'Top 10 university', York has consistently been present near the top of the UK league tables, coming second only to Cambridge in the Daily Telegraph league tables from 2002 to 2006, beating Oxford into third place. It is one of the youngest Universities in the world to be ranked top 100 in the overall <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a>, and in the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> York was ranked 88th in the world (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings). In the same rankings York is listed as 34th for Life Sciences &amp; Biomedicine.</p>
<p> The Sunday Times released averages of all its tables over 10 years, ranking York as 6th in the country from 1998 - 2007.</p>

<p>The campus is also home to the <a>National Science Learning Centre</a>. Opened in March 2006 by then-<a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Tony Blair</a>, it serves as the hub for a &#x00a3;51 million national network of centres dedicated to revitalising science teaching in schools. It is operated by the <a>White Rose University Consortium</a> (which comprises the Universities of <a>Leeds</a>, <a>Sheffield</a> and York) together with <a>Sheffield Hallam University</a>.</p>
<h2>Student activities</h2>
<p> &lt;!-- Media and film --&gt;</p>
<p>York Student Cinema (YSC), operating since the late 1960s, show around 30 films a term using a professional 35&nbsp;mm projector and a full size cinemascope screen in one of the largest rooms on campus.<a>York Student Television</a> (YSTV) was founded at the University in 1967 and is England's oldest <a>student television station</a>. YSTV once held the world record for longest continuous television broadcast under a single director. The University of York Filmmaking Society is a student-run filmmaking group; since 1999 its members have made two feature films and many shorts, some of which have been shown at national film festivals. </p>
<p><a>University Radio York</a> (URY), the student radio station, is the oldest independent <a>radio station</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, and winner of the Student Radio Awards Best Station Award 2005. <a>Nouse</a>, the oldest student newspaper and longest-running student society on campus, was established in 1964 and was 2005  NUS/Mirror Student paper of the year and 2009 NUS Best Student Media. It has also won multiple Guardian Student Newspaper awards throughout the past decade, for both its pioneering website and outstanding individual journalists. Its rival newspaper, <a>Vision</a>, was named Guardian Student Newspaper of the Year for three consecutive years between 2002 and 2004&#x2014;the only time this has occurred in the 27-year history of the prestigious awards&#x2014;and won it again in 2007. It also won Best Small Budget Publication at the 2006 NUS/Mirror National Student Media Awards.</p>
<p><a>The Lemon Press</a>, York's satire magazine, was launched in 2009 and has rapidly gained popularity in both its print and online formats. In 2010 it won the NUS Award for Best Student Media, having existed only one year.  <a>The Yorker</a> is a rapidly growing online publication set up by students as an independent company in 2007; it was nominated for the Guardian Student media awards The Lords of Misrule are a group of current and former graduate students at the Centre for Medieval Studies at King's Manor who enjoy bringing the theatre of the Middle Ages to life.  Since their inception in the 1960s. the Lords have been performing dramas and adaptations of medieval texts in their original languages, frequently in historic locations.  Their performances strive to present the spirit of medieval drama to a modern audience.  The group's most recent performances were in the <a>York Mystery Plays</a> on 11 and 18 July 2010, performing the Curriers' Pageant of the Transfiguration of Christ. <a>http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/</a> </p>
<p>&lt;!-- Politics/activism --&gt; The York Union Society, the University of York's debating union, competes in intervarsity tournaments against other universities. There are also very active political societies on campus with the <a>University of York Labour Club</a> (YULC) and the University of York Conservative and Unionist Association campaigning on issues both on and off campus, as well as organising debates and talks by high profile speakers. In recent years there have been visits by <a>Ed Miliband</a>, <a>David Davis</a>, <a>Nick Clegg</a>, <a>David Blunkett</a>, <a>Anthony Giddens</a>, <a>Ruth Lea</a>, <a>Dominic Green</a> and <a>David Willets</a>. There is also a branch of <a>People and Planet</a>, which campaigns on environmental and ethical issues.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Trans --&gt; Provisions for lesbian, gay bisexual and trans (<a>LGBT</a>) students at the university are divided among two distinct organisations. YUSU LGBT is a part of the students' union and represents LGBT students within the union, as well as providing welfare support and conducting awareness raising campaigns on campus. LGBT Social organises social events aimed at LGBT students and their friends. While remaining separate, these two groups generally have strong links to each other and to the staff LGBTI forum, which offers largely similar provision to staff members of the university.</p>
