<p>  <strong>Avondale College</strong> is an Australian tertiary education provider affiliated with the <a>Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>.  Avondale College has two campuses, <a>Lake Macquarie</a> being the primary campus situated in <a>Cooranbong</a>, <a>New South Wales</a>.  The other campus is the Sydney campus located at the <a>Sydney Adventist Hospital</a> in the <a>Sydney</a>-suburb of <a>Wahroonga</a>, housing most of the faculty of nursing and health. Avondale College primarily focuses in the areas of <a>teaching</a>, <a>theology</a>, and <a>nursing</a>, but also offers <a>bachelor's degree</a>s in business, science and the arts as well as certificate studies in outdoor recreation.  The nursing programme commences at the Cooranbong campus for one or two semesters and is completed at the <a>Sydney Adventist Hospital</a> with hands-on experience gained in the hospital.  <a>Master's degree</a>s are offered in theology, education, nursing, ministry, and some business related fields by distance education, including a one-month on-campus component in the winter semester.</p>
<p>Avondale College is an institution under the <a>South Pacific Division of Seventh-day Adventists</a>. The library contains a local research centre of the <a>Ellen G. White Estate</a>.</p>
<h2>History and surroundings</h2>
<p>A small Bible school was commenced in Melbourne in 1892, on the counsel of <a>Ellen G. White</a>. She preferred a rural location, and as a result a search for a rural location was commenced in 1893.</p>
<p>The Cooranbong shopping district and Freeman's drive now occupy some of the land that was part of the <a>Avondale Estate</a>, creating a disjoint estate. The Avondale Schools (a separate entity) and the Cooranbong Aerodrome (which up until 2006 was used as part of the aviation certificate training) are located on one section and the college on the other. The nearby Sunnyside museum has photographs of the college through its early years.</p>
<h3>Educational philosophy</h3>
<p>During the 1890s, Ellen White reformed the curriculum to make the <a>Bible</a> the center of study, in place of the <a>classics</a>. This change soon spread to the <a>United States</a>.</pre>
<h3>Heritage architecture</h3>
<p>There are a number of historic buildings that have been preserved on the Cooranbong campus.  These include Bethel Hall and College Hall (formerly the College Chapel), both of which are unique multi-story wooden buildings. The refurbished Chan-Shun Auditorium is based on the original auditorium.</p>
<h3>Later history</h3>
<p>Shortly after 1951, students could study a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> through the external program of the <a>University of London</a>, and a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> through <a>Pacific Union College</a>. Avondale has offered PhD degrees since 2006 when it was approved to do so by the <a>New South Wales Department of Education and Training</a>. Enrollment for the school reopened in January 2009. However, it is expected that the school will be sold during 2009., but as of mid 2010 the sale is being finalised.</p>
<h2>Academic divisions</h2>
<p>The college has a number of faculties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Faculty of Arts</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Business and Information Technology</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Nursing and Health</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Science and Mathematics</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Theology</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subjects <a>Christian Studies I</a> and <a>II</a> (or substitutes) are required for all students. The first covers salvation and Christian belief and lifestyle, while the second has a more specifically Adventist focus. A three year study of student grades by faith tradition showed &quot;little statistical variation&quot;, meaning &quot;[b]aptised Adventists are not advantaged and those of other faith traditions are not disadvantaged&quot;.</p>
<p>Avondale is the primary place of training for ministers in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia and New Zealand, and also has many students from the islands of the South Pacific. It is also open to students of any denomination.</p>
<p>The College runs <a>Avondale Academic Press</a>, a small <a>academic publisher</a>. The College is currently in the process of applying for and receiving University status from the <a>Australian government</a>.</p>
