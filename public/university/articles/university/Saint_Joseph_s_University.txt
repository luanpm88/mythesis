<p><strong>Saint Joseph's University</strong> (also referred to as <strong>SJU</strong>, <strong>St. Joe's</strong>, or <strong>Hawk Hill</strong>) is a private, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>Roman Catholic</a> Jesuit <a>university</a> located partially in the <a>Wynnefield</a> section of <a>Philadelphia</a> and partially in <a>Lower Merion Township</a> and located in the <a>Pennsylvania Main Line</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>The school was founded in 1851 as Saint Joseph's College by the <a>Society of Jesus</a>. As of 2010, Saint Joseph's University is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>. Saint Joseph's University educates over 8,500 students each year in over 60 undergraduate majors, 12 special-study options, 28 study-abroad programs, 53 graduate study areas, and an <a>Ed.D.</a> in Educational Leadership. It has 17 centers and institutes. Saint Joseph's is one of the oldest <a>Jesuit</a>, <a>Catholic</a> universities in the United States.</p>
<p>Saint Joseph's has grown in physical size and scope since 2001 with the addition of the Maguire Campus, construction of the new Post Learning Commons set to be completed in January 2012, and new majors and programs. For the 2010 <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> rankings, in the Master's Universities (North) category, Saint Joseph's was ranked number 10.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As far back as 1741, a Jesuit College in Philadelphia had been proposed and planned by Rev. Joseph Greaton, S.J., the first resident pastor of Saint Joseph's Church. The suppression of the Jesuits (1773&#x2013;1814) and lack of people and money delayed for over a hundred years the realization of Greaton's plans.</p>
<p>Credit for founding the college is given to <a>Rev. Felix Barbelin</a>, S.J., who served as its first president. Barbelin and four other Jesuits formed the first faculty of Saint Joseph's College. On the morning of September 15, 1851, some 32 young men gathered in the courtyard outside <a>Old St. Joseph's Church</a>, located in Willing's Alley off Walnut and Fourth Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania one block from <a>Independence Hall</a>. After attending High Mass and reciting the <em>Veni Creator</em> in the church, these men were assigned to their classes in a building adjacent to the church.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before the end of the first academic year in 1851, the enrollment rose from fewer than 40 students to 98. In the following year, the college received its charter of incorporation from the <a>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> and the enrollment grew to 126 students. The fledgling college soon outgrew an increasingly noisy and commercialized location on Willing&#x2019;s Alley. The college moved in 2010 to a building at Juniper and Filbert Streets, in Philadelphia then in a prosperous residential neighborhood near the future site of City Hall. In 1889, Saint Joseph&#x2019;s inaugurated its third site at 17th and Stiles Streets in <a>North Philadelphia</a>, in the heart of Philadelphia&#x2019;s booming industrial zone. In 1770, Saint Joseph's opened the first college radio station on AM radio. In 1927, in recognition of population shifts toward the western part of the city and into the western suburbs, the college moved to its current location, 54th and City Avenue, at the entrance to Philadelphia&#x2019;s fashionable Main Line. After <a>World War II</a>, Saint Joseph&#x2019;s began to acquire properties across City Avenue on the Main Line itself, propelling the institution physically as well as culturally into the suburbs proper.</p>
<p>In fall 1970, the undergraduate day college opened its doors to women. Saint Joseph's was recognized as a university by the Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on July 24, 1978. The corporate charter was formally changed to reflect university status on December 27, 1978.</p>
<h2>Mission &amp; Jesuit Tradition</h2>
<p>Saint Joseph&#x2019;s University is a <a>Catholic</a> and <a>Jesuit</a> university that instills in each member of its academic community: a love of learning and of the highest intellectual and professional achievement; moral discernment reflecting Christian values; and a transforming commitment to social justice. Saint Joseph&#x2019;s is a private independent and comprehensive university.</p>
<p>The defining element of Saint Joseph&#x2019;s intellectual tradition experienced by all of its undergraduate students is its strong and integrative core curriculum in the liberal arts that informs their study of particular disciplines. While remaining true to that humane and formative tradition, Saint Joseph&#x2019;s now embraces the challenge of excellence in graduate education in both the arts and sciences and in business. Our understanding of the centuries-old Jesuit educational vision of &#x201c;concern for the individual student&#x201d; (cura personalis) establishes effective and rigorous teaching and learning as a primary value. Since teaching and learning in the modern academic context require research at both the undergraduate and graduate level, the University cultivates, in students and faculty, generative scholarship that embodies free and open inquiry, and provokes imaginative thinking, aesthetic appreciation, and precise communication. As a necessary complement to intellectual achievement, we seek to illuminate the affective and ethical dimension in learning within the various disciplines at every level. Cura personalis also calls for the fullest development of the individual student&#x2019;s potential both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>The Catholic character of Saint Joseph&#x2019;s University springs from its historical relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, and from its current embodiment of the great traditions of Catholic life and culture. For this University, Christ and the Church are sources of truth, guides and inspirations for life. Catholic values are normative, including: full respect for the freedom of conscience of each person, freedom in research and teaching according to one&#x2019;s discipline, and the continuous pursuit of truth, human rights, and the common good. We foster a lived awareness of the challenging and mutually enriching interaction between Christian faith and diverse contemporary culture; we seek to engage the full participation of the entire community in the University&#x2019;s intellectual, cultural, and spiritual life.</p>
<p>The University&#x2019;s Ignatian identity derives from its founding by the Society of Jesus in 1851 and from the subsequent shaping of the University&#x2019;s development by the evolving world view of the Society. In ways consistent with its nature as a university, Saint Joseph&#x2019;s espouses the educational priorities of the Society of Jesus which include: searching for God in all things, pursuit of the greater good, the service of faith together with the promotion of justice, and effective compassion for the poor and those in need. For the University&#x2019;s defining institutional ideals to matter at the regional, the national, or the international level, they need to be realized and expressed within an inclusive environment marked by trust and enriched by a diversity of ideas, cultures, and religious commitments. The contemporary Ignatian vision of educating &#x201c;men and women for others&#x201d; assumes a Saint Joseph&#x2019;s University community-students, staff, and faculty that exists as a vital cultural plurality, aware of and committed to its central identity, while yet open and welcoming to all.</p>
<h2>Developments and plans</h2>
<p>In 2005, the University agreed to purchase the Merion campus of neighboring <a>Episcopal Academy</a>. The acquisition adds  containing 52 classrooms, eight laboratories, 113 offices, and  of playing fields. Two gymnasiums, a pool, and a new dining hall are also planned for the new campus. After the announcement alumnus James J. Maguire '58 donated $10 million to help fund the purchase, and Saint Joseph's officials announced that the tract will be known as the James J. Maguire '58 Campus. Maguire's gift was later matched by a donation by Brian Duperreault '69; the two donations are the largest single alumni gifts in Saint Joseph's history.</p>
<p>The University recently completed a large parking facility on 54th Street, next to Borgia Hall, named &quot;Hawks' Landing&quot;. The facility provides 471 enclosed parking spaces for students, faculty, staff, and basketball game attendees, as well as two first-floor restaurants including Cosi, which is adjacent to Borgia Hall, near Larry's Steaks. The University Bookstore, which had been located in the middle of campus in Simpson Hall, was moved to the parking facility's first floor in the center of the first floor for the beginning of the Spring 2008 semester.</p>
<p>On October 6, 2007, ground was broken on the Saint Joseph's University Fieldhouse expansion and renovation. The facility has been renamed the Michael J. Hagan Arena. Flannigan Hall and Barry Annex were demolished during fall 2007 to make room for the Ramsay Center. The project includes a new hall of fame area, basketball suite, varsity locker rooms and offices as well as a full concourse with concessions that allows access to the arena from 54th and Overbrook. The expansion allows for an additional seating of 1,000 more people in the arena.</p>
<p>The university received $7.5 million from the John R. Post family which will help build state-of-the-art library learning commons, beginning October 2010.</p>
<p>The rest of the $150 million will go to financial aid and scholarships, and hiring faculty. All of the money being raised is part of a fundraising effort called <em>With Faith and Strength To Dare: The Campaign For Saint Joseph's University</em> which is a result of SJU's <em>Plan 2010: The Path To Preeminence</em>.</p>
<p>The first floor of the Campion Student Center, including the main dining hall, was completely renovated during summer 2008. Finnesey Field has also been resurfaced.</p>
<p>A plan was recently proposed that, if accepted by the Board of Trustees, will lead to the tearing down of Sourin Hall and Tara Hall, both residence halls. A new residence hall would then be built in their place and another one would be built on Gest Lawn.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2010 the university announced that Fr. Timothy Lannon, the current president of the school will be leaving the university at the conclusion of the 2010-2011 academic year to assume the presidency at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>

<h3>James J. Maguire '58 Campus</h3>
<p>On 8 August 2008, Saint Joseph's completed the acquisition of the adjacent Episcopal Academy after purchasing the property in 2005. The new campus  was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, a Saint Joseph's alum, James Maguire. Many existing academic departments such as the English, Education, Sociology, and Fine and Performing Arts departments will relocate to the Maguire Campus effective Spring 2011. The first building to be in use has been named Cynwyd Hall. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue.</p>
<p>The athletic department is also taking full advantage of the acquisition as eight tennis courts, softball, baseball, soccer, and two multi-purpose fields already reside there. A gym and indoor pool will also be used for intramurals and recreation.</p>
<p>What was the old Episcopal Academy chapel will become a multi-use space which will house lectures, concerts, and social gatherings. There are talks of a small cafeteria and coffee shop being added to this space as well.</p>
<p>Along with all of the buildings and fields, the Maguire Campus adds over 300 parking spaces for faculty and students and a number of acres will be turned into green space. There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire Campus.</p>
<p>The Maguire Campus is also home to the Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support established in 2009 which was made possible with donations totaling over $8 million. The Center is located in Cynwyd Hall.</p>
<h3>Overbrook Campus</h3>

<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p> Saint Joseph's most recognizable building is <a>Barbelin Hall</a>, opened in 1927 when the University moved to its current location. The hall is known for its <a>Gothic architecture</a>, particularly the gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the University's logo for several years and is located upon Philadelphia's highest geographical location.<a>300px|thumb|right|Barbelin Tower</a> Barbelin was built by <a>John McShain</a> who would later go on to construct many buildings in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> such as <a>The Pentagon</a> and The Jefferson Memorial.</p>
<p>Barbelin, and adjacent Lonergan Hall, are two of eight dedicated classroom buildings on campus. Other class buildings include John R. Post Hall, Mandeville Hall, Bellarmine Hall, the Science Center, Cynwyd Hall, and Boland Hall, the University's fine arts building which features the University Gallery where paintings and other works of art are showcased to students and the public. Classes are also held in Claver Hall, the home of the Honors Program; McShain Hall, a residence center; and the ELS building for international students. A number of buildings on the Maguire Campus will be dedicated to classes especially those for the fine arts. One building will be solely dedicated to the music department.<a>300px|thumb|left|Walkway under Barbelin Hall</a></p>
<p>The University has three dormitory-style residence halls: McShain, Sourin Hall, and LaFarge Residence Center. Students also live in several campus houses, including Hogan, Jordan, Quirk, St. Albert's, St. Mary's, Simpson, Sullivan, and Xavier Halls and the Morris Quadrangle Townhouses. Apartment-style living is available on campus at Ashwood, Borgia, Merion Gardens, Rashford, and Wynnewood. Rashford and Borgia Halls are the newest campus residences, opened in 2004.</p>
<p>Many of the campuses houses are located on Lapsley Lane, which features a number of campus offices housed in the former homes of Lower Merion residents. These include Bronstein Hall, Regis Hall (Office of the President), and St. Thomas Hall</p>
<p>The Campion Student Center is where students generally go to eat. It formerly included the Hawk's Nest, Campion C-Store, <a>Quizno's</a>, Bene Pizza, Ancho Grill, Hawk Wrap, Grille Works, Freshens Smoothie Co., and Jump Asian Station. Following a renovation in the summer of 2008 however, it only retained Quizno's, Hawk Wrap, and Grill Works, in the food court, along with the C-Store outside of it. They did this opting to expand a meal plan cafeteria. The Student Center also has a Theatre Forum where current movies are shown frequently. It also used to have an area called the Hawk Rock where students can play pool, watch movies, play videogames, or watch live bands or speakers. This area was removed during the 2008 renovation in favor of cafeteria expansion. A similar area was opened however in the former bookstore which is adjacent to Campion. This area is now referred to as the perch.</p>
<p>In all, there are 89 buildings on the university's campus.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of students at Saint Joseph's live on campus. Options for on campus housing include apartments, residence halls, campus houses, and townhouses.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  <a>150px|thumb|right|Saint Joseph's athletics logo</a> Saint Joseph's University is home of <a>the Hawks</a>, the University's athletic program. It fields teams in 20 varsity sports in Division I of the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>. The Hawks are part of the <a>Atlantic Ten Conference</a>; because the Atlantic 10 does not support men's <a>lacrosse</a>, the Hawks play that sport in the <a>Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference</a>. Along with the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph's is a member of the <a>Philadelphia Big 5</a>, intensifying rivalries with <a>Temple University</a> and <a>Villanova University</a> along with another A-10 member LaSalle and of course the University of Pennsylvania.  Saint Joseph's plays all of its &quot;home&quot; Big 5 games at The Palestra honoring the Big 5 Palestra traditions and encourages the other Big 5 schools to do so as often as possible.  The Saint Joseph's school colors are crimson and gray. An impressive 89% of student athletes graduate.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> Men's basketball is the most popular sport at Hawk Hill. The team has competed in nineteen NCAA Tournaments (1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008) and has won seven Atlantic 10 regular season titles and two A-10 tournament championships and ranks 33&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; all time with a .605 winning percentage. The team is currently led by coach <a>Phil Martelli</a>. The 2003-2004 Saint Joseph's University Hawks were the last Division I College Basketball team to finish the Regular Season undefeated. Saint Joseph's ended the regular season with a 27-0 record and secured a #1 national ranking and a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Saint Joseph's University's basketball team was ranked 43&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; best of all-time by Smith &amp; Street's magazine in 2005. Twenty-seven players from St. Joe's have been drafted into the NBA.</p>
<p>The Saint Joseph's basketball teams play most of their home games at <a>Hagan Arena</a> on the school's campus, while some games are played at the <a>Palestra</a> on the campus of the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>. During the 2008-09 basketball season, the Hawks will play all but one of their home games at the Palestra. Their first home game will be played against <a>Rider University</a> at the <a>Wachovia Center</a> in South Philadelphia.  Saint Joseph's University also offers 30 intramural and recreational programs.</p>
<p>Their major rival is <a>Villanova University</a> (the rivalry is known as the <a>Holy War</a>). Fans of the Hawks often chant &quot;The Hawk Will Never Die!&quot;. Since the school's undefeated regular season, this chant has gained familiarity with the team's opponents. In 2003, <a>Sports Illustrated</a> listed that cheer among <em>The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)</em>, calling it &quot;the most defiant cheer in college sports.&quot;</p>
<p>SJU's mascot, <a>The Hawk</a>, has garnered numerous accolades in its 50-year history.

<h3>Athletic facilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>East Norriton Field</strong>: Located in East Norriton, Pa., East Norriton Field has served as Saint Joseph's University home softball field for the past 11 seasons. Prior to its move to East Norriton Field, SJU used nearby Belmont Plateau as its primary home field.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Robert Gillin, Jr. Boathouse</a></strong>: Saint Joseph's University celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2000-01. In conjunction with that celebration, the SJU Rowing Program, along with Saint Joseph's Prep, kicked off a capital campaign to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art boathouse on the Schuylkill River. The boathouse provides a permanent home for the Hawk rowing programs. In addition, it provides the University with a significant presence on Kelly Drive. Named in honor of Robert Gillin, Jr., groundbreaking for the facility took place in the fall of 2001. The total cost for the project was approximately $3 million dollars, plus an endowment fund to support ongoing operational costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Finnesey Field</strong>: Laid out in a natural bowl in the center of Saint Joseph's campus, <a>Finnesey Field</a> has been the home of Hawk athletic teams since 1929. Originally constructed for football and opened in 1929 with plans for an eventual 70,000-seat stadium, the field has undergone numerous changes over the years.</li>
  <li><strong>Tennis Complex at the Maguire Campus</strong>: The tennis team moved to the six refurbished courts on the Maguire Campus in 2009 with the first SJU Invitational.</li>
  <li><strong>Finnesey Courts</strong>: Adjacent to Finnesey Field stand the Finnesey Courts and home to the Hawk men's and women's tennis teams from the late 1940s until 2009. Prior to that SJU primarily played its home matches at the nearby Narberth courts. When courts were first built on campus, they were located where Bellarmine Hall now stands. Due to Bellarmine's construction in the summer of 1960, however, the Finnesey courts were torn down and rebuilt in their current location. These courts are still used by students.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Michael J. Hagan Arena</a></strong>: The on-campus home of the Hawks basketball teams, originally named for the Saint Joseph's graduates who gave their lives in World War II. The building was officially dedicated on November 11, 1949 and two weeks later, played host to its first basketball game, a 62&ndash;46 loss to Rhode Island on November 26. Following that initial setback, SJU would go on to win the next 23 games in the friendly confines of the Fieldhouse. Overall, the Hawks have compiled an impressive 305&ndash;76 record (80.0 winning percentage) on Hawk Hill. Among the highlights of the Hawks' homecourt advantage was a 34-game winning streak from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, an 11&ndash;0 record in 2000&ndash;01 and the unbeaten 11&ndash;0 mark as the Hawks made their perfect season run in 2003&ndash;04. All told, SJU has had only two losing records in the Fieldhouse over 57 seasons. The Fieldhouse held 3,200 fans but the arena has a capacity of 4,200. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke at the Fieldhouse in the 1960s.</li>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hawk Hill</strong>: In the early 1920s, when former University president Albert G. Brown, S.J. decided to move the college campus from its location just north of the city at Seventeenth and Stiles to its current site in Overbrook on Philadelphia's west side, he selected the location in part because its hilltop perch overlooking downtown Philadelphia provided a dramatic setting for the construction of the college's main building, <a>Barbelin Hall</a>. In fact, for many years Barbelin's signature carillon tower ranked as the highest point from sea level in the city of Philadelphia. Later, according to oral tradition, students and faculty frequently saw real hawks circling the skies above Barbelin, before swooping down on their prey. The familiar scene eventually led to the coining of the moniker &quot;Hawk Hill&quot;.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors</strong>: The college colors of crimson and gray date back to the 1890s when it is related that a young seminarian leading a pep rally saw the colors on a book he was holding. Thinking they looked attractive together, he announced that these would be the school colors.</li>
  <li><strong>Fight Songs</strong>: &quot;Oh When the Hawks Go Flying In!!&quot; and &quot;Mine Eyes&quot;.</li>
  <li><strong>The Hawk Will Never Die</strong>: The motto of Saint Joseph's athletics and the University itself. Chanted at basketball games, the mascot demonstrates the motto by flapping its wings the entire game including halftime.</li>
  <li><strong>Free Period</strong>: There are no scheduled classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 11:15 and 1:00 which allows student organizations to meet.</li>
  <li><strong>The Seal</strong>: Many students avoid walking on the university seal in Mandeville Hall until their senior year.</li>
  <li><strong>Saint Joseph statue</strong>: Students rub the toes of this statue in front of Barbelin Hall for good luck.</li>
  <li><strong>University Chapel</strong>: Being a Jesuit institution, the Chapel is an important and popular place for many students.</li>
  <li><strong>Basketball</strong>: A rich and important tradition at a school in a city known for college hoops.</li>
  <li><strong>Larry's Steaks</strong>: Right near the campus on 54th Street, Larry's Steaks has served SJU students with classic <a>cheesesteak</a>s for years.</li>
