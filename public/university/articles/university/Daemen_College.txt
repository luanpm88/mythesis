<p> <strong>Daemen College</strong> is a <a>liberal arts college</a> located on Main Street in <a>Amherst, New York</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daemen was founded in 1947 as <strong>Rosary Hill College</strong> for women by the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity, headed by Magdalene Daemen. The school became <a>co-ed</a> in 1971, and changed its name in 1976 to honor its founder. Currently, Daemen is a non-sectarian four-year <a>liberal arts</a> <a>college</a>.</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>Of particular interest to many prospective students are the <a>Physician Assistant</a> and <a>Physical Therapy</a> programs, for which the school has a nationwide reputation. A significant number of students in these two departments are from outside of <a>Western New York</a>. </p>
<p>There are more than thirty undergraduate programs and six graduate programs at the school.</p>
<h2>Curriculum</h2>
<p>Daemen College is unique for its Core Curriculum, which is competency-based. Students who graduate from the College are expected to master critical thinking and creative problem solving, literacy in information and multi-media technology, communication skills, affective judgment, moral and ethical discernment, contextual competency, and civic responsibility.

<h2>Mission statement</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Daemen College sign and 2009 construction</a> :<em>The mission of Daemen College is to prepare students for life and leadership in an increasingly complex world. Founded on the principle that education should elevate human dignity and foster civic responsibility and compassion, the college seeks to integrate the intellectual qualities acquired through study of the liberal arts with the education necessary for professional accomplishment. This integration which recognizes equal value in liberal studies and professional programs aims at preparing graduates who are dedicated to the health and well-being of both their local and global communities. </em></p>
<p>:<em>With a Daemen education students will acquire the skill to solve problems creatively and think critically. They will be comfortable with diversity and will recognize the importance of a global perspective. They will be able to work with others and be invigorated by environments that present challenges and demand innovation. Daemen students are expected to be active participants in their own education and informed citizens who understand that learning is a life-long journey.</em></p>
<p>:<em>At the heart of Daemen's integrated learning experience is the relationship that can develop between the college's faculty and its students. Daemen prides itself on maintaining a student-centered atmosphere and a close professional and collaborative association among all members of the college community. Assisted by a supportive faculty, Daemen students are encouraged to pursue goals beyond their initial expectations, to respond to academic challenges, and to develop habits of mind that enrich their lives and their community.</em></p>
<h2>Gersh Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Gersh College</strong> is a <a>college</a> program established for students with <a>neurological disorders</a> who would have had difficulty in a public college. The school will be located in the former George L. Lowry Middle School building and its accompanying  in <a>North Tonawanda, New York</a>. The school will offer a two-year program for students with neurobiological disorders such as high functioning <a>autism</a>, <a>Tourette syndrome</a>, ADHD, OCD, and bipolar disorder.  Individuals with violent histories are not candidates. The school is designed to educate the academically gifted who have neurobiological disorders.  The <a>middle school</a> was closed down after the 2003-2004 school year due to budget and claims that the building was not maintained properly. The property was subsequently bought from the city by Gersh Management Services for a sum of $700,000 (this was the lowest of the three offered bids because it was the only offer that did not require tax deferment). Gersh also owns another school in <a>New York State</a>, Gersh Academy, which provides the same support for younger children. </p>
<p>Gersh College is expected to open no later than September 2007 and plans to open with a partnership with nearby Daemen College in <a>Amherst</a>.</p>
