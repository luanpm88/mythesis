<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>US News and World report rates UTPA as a tier 2 University.  </p>

<h3>Admissions, enrollment and retention</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Historically UTPA has had open enrollment such that any student to gradate from an approved public or private high school was granted admission to the University.  This policy was implemented by former president Miguel Nevarez.  After Nevarez retired UTPA moved towards minimum admission standards.  The minimum standards for Fall 2011 admission are a diploma from a recognized high school and a combined Math/Verbal SAT score of 860 or an ACT score of 18.  Additionally the admission will be met with a SAT score of 810 or ACT score of 17 if the applicant is in the top third of his/her graduating class or an SAT score of 760 or ACT score of 16 will suffice if the applicant is in the top quarter of his/her graduating class.  Any student who gradates from a recognized Texas high school as a member of the top 10% or his/her graduating class is guaranteed admission.</p>
<p>In 1997 UTPA started the University Scholars Program in an attempt to retain top local high school students.  The program is an objective academic scholarship based on three tiers.  The first tier is high school graduation standing.  The second tier is advanced placement testings.  The third tier is standardized testing scores.  UTPA will guarantee full tuition funding for any student who meets one of many objective minimum requirements in all three tiers.</p>
<p>UTPA's first to second year retention rate for full time students is 71%.  UTPA's 4-year graduation rate is 13% and the 6-year graduation rate is 36%.  The proportion of students who receive some sort of financial aid is 86%.</p>
