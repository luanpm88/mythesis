<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Manchester</strong> is a &quot;<a>red brick</a>&quot; civic <a>university</a> located in <a>Manchester</a>, England. It is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of large research-intensive universities and the <a>N8 Group</a> for research collaboration. The university was formed in 2004 by the dissolution of the <em><a>Victoria University of Manchester</a></em> (which was commonly known as the University of Manchester) and <em><a>UMIST</a></em> (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) and the immediate formation of a single institution inaugurated on 1 October. The University of Manchester and the constituent former institutions combined have <a>25 Nobel Laureates</a> among their past and present students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom behind <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>.</p>
<p>Following the merger, the university was named <a><em>Sunday Times</em> University of the Year</a> in 2006 after winning the inaugural <em><a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em> University of the Year prize in 2005. According to <em><a>The Sunday Times</a></em>, &quot;Manchester has a formidable reputation spanning most disciplines, but most notably in the life sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, sociology and the social sciences&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2007/08, the University of Manchester had over 40,000 students studying 500 academic programmes and more than 10,000 staff, making it the largest single-site university in the United Kingdom. More students try to gain entry to the University of Manchester than any other university in the country, with more than 60,000 applications for undergraduate courses alone.</p>
<p>In the first national assessment of higher education research since the university&#x2019;s founding, the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, the University of Manchester came 3rd in terms of research power after Cambridge and Oxford and 8th for grade point average quality when including specialist institutions.  The university was also ranked 8th in Europe and 26th worldwide by the <a>Times Higher World University Rankings</a> 2009, although the 2010 rankings placed it as 9th in Europe and 30th in the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:Whitworth Hall.jpg|thumb|The university's Whitworth Hall. This archway was the inspiration for the logo of the [[Victoria University of Manchester]]]] The University's history as an academic institution began in 1824 and is closely linked to Manchester's emergence as the world's first industrial city. The English <a>chemist</a> <a>John Dalton</a>, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the <a>Mechanics' Institute</a> (later to become <a>UMIST</a>) to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science. Similarly, <a>John Owens</a>, a Manchester textile merchant, left a bequest of &#x00a3;96,942 in 1846 for the purpose of founding a college for the education of males on non-sectarian lines. His <a>trustee</a>s established <a>Owens College</a> at Manchester in 1851. It was initially housed in a building, complete with Adam staircase, on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the <a>philanthropist</a> <a>Richard Cobden</a>, and subsequently was to house Manchester County Court. In 1873 it moved to new buildings at Oxford Road, <a>Chorlton-on-Medlock</a> and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. The university was established and granted a <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1880 to become England's first civic university; it was renamed the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> in 1903 and then absorbed Owens College the following year.</p>
<p>By 1905 the two institutions were large and active forces in the area, with the Municipal College of Technology, the forerunner of the later UMIST, forming the Faculty of Technology of the Victoria University of Manchester while continuing as a technical college in parallel with the advanced courses of study in the Faculty.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Is the following paragraph really relevant for the section about history of the Manchester University? It seems that it defends only an opinion of an individual which was expressed in the 1980s. Maybe this should be moved to either the VUM article or the one about UMIST. --&gt; In 1987 Emeritus Professor John Griffith, then Chancellor of Manchester University, warned in an article entitled &quot;The Attack on Higher Education&quot; of the serious danger he saw in government policy which seeks to control the management of higher education. He pointed out the political weakness of the universities in the face of such governmental attack, a weakness which he saw as stemming from the universities' hierarchical structure, and the consequent antagonisms of political viewpoint between university heads and their staff. He concluded: &quot;The history of this century in many countries warns us that democracy depends on a large degree of autonomy for the institutions of higher education. No governments of any political complexion must be allowed to destroy their freedom&quot;. In 1994 George Wilmers, elected member of Senate and Post Graduate Tutor in Mathematics, wrote: &quot;Since that article was written the independence of both universities and individual academics has been savagely eroded, and one of the principal mechanisms for that erosion has been the corruption of the principle of collegial governance.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the merger, the University and UMIST between them counted 23 <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners amongst their former staff and students. Manchester has traditionally been particularly strong in the sciences, with the nuclear nature of the atom being discovered at Manchester by Rutherford, and the world's <a>first stored-program computer</a> coming into being at the university. Famous scientists associated with the university include the <a>physicist</a>s <a>Osborne Reynolds</a>, <a>Niels Bohr</a>, <a>Ernest Rutherford</a>, <a>James Chadwick</a>, <a>Arthur Schuster</a>, <a>Hans Geiger</a>, <a>Ernest Marsden</a> and <a>Balfour Stewart</a>. However, the university has also contributed in many other fields, such as by the work of the <a>mathematician</a>s <a>Paul Erd&#x0151;s</a>, <a>Horace Lamb</a> and <a>Alan Turing</a>; the author <a>Anthony Burgess</a>; <a>philosopher</a>s <a>Samuel Alexander</a>, <a>Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> and <a>Alasdair MacIntyre</a>; the <a>Pritzker Prize</a> and <a>RIBA Stirling Prize</a> winning <a>architect</a> <a>Norman Foster</a> and the <a>composer</a> <a>Peter Maxwell Davies</a> all attended, or worked in, Manchester. Well-known figures among the current academic staff include author <a>Martin Amis</a>, computer scientist <a>Steve Furber</a>, literary critic <a>Terry Eagleton</a>, economist <a>Richard Nelson</a> and biochemist Sir <a>John Sulston</a>, Nobel laureate of 2002.</p>
<p>In 2004, the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> (established in 1851) and the <a>University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> (established in 1824) were formally merged into a single institution.</p>
<h3>The university today</h3>
<p>[[Image:UMIST main building Whitworth Street.jpg|thumb|The [[Sackville Street (Manchester)|Sackville Street Building]], formerly known as <a>UMIST</a> Main building]] The newly merged University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when <a>the Queen</a> handed over the <a>Royal Charter</a>. It has the largest number of full time students in the UK, unless the <a>University of London</a> is counted as a single university. It teaches more academic subjects than any other British university. The founding President and <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> of the new university was <a>Alan Gilbert</a>, former Vice-Chancellor of the <a>University of Melbourne</a>, who retired at the end of the 2009-2010 academic year. The current vice chancellor is Professor Dame <a>Nancy Rothwell</a>, who held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. One of the university's aims stated in the <em>Manchester 2015 Agenda</em> is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world.  This follows Alan Gilbert's aim for the university to 'establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance'. Manchester has the largest total income of all UK universities, standing at &#x00a3;637 million as of 2007. it comprises two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>North campus</em>, centred on <a>Sackville Street</a></li>
  <li><em>South campus</em>, centred on <a>Oxford Road</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These names are not officially recognised by the University, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website; another usage is Sackville Street Campus and Oxford Road Campus.  They roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively, although there was already some overlap before the merger.</p>
<p><a>Fallowfield Campus</a> is the main residential campus of the University. It is located in <a>Fallowfield</a>, approximately 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the main site.</p>
<p>There are a number of other university buildings located throughout the city and the wider region, such as <a>One Central Park</a> (in the northern suburb of <a>Moston</a>) and <a>Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> (in the nearby county of <a>Cheshire</a>). The former is a collaboration between Manchester University and other partners in the region which offers office space to accommodate new start-up firms as well as venues for conferences and workshops.</p>
<p>Despite its size The University of Manchester is divided into only four faculties, each sub-divided into schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a>Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences</a></strong> consisting of the Schools of <em><a>Medicine</a></em>; <em>Dentistry</em>; <em>Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work</em>; <em>Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences</em>; and <em><a>Psychological Sciences</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences</a></strong> consisting of the Schools of <em><a>Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science</a></em>; <em>Chemistry</em>; <em><a>Computer Science</a></em>; <em>Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Science</em>; <em><a>Physics and Astronomy</a></em>; <em>Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering</em>; <em><a>Materials</a></em>; <em><a>Mathematics</a></em>; and <em><a>Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Faculty of Humanities</a></strong> includes the School of <em>Arts, Histories and Cultures</em> (incorporating Archaeology; Art History &amp; Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Museology; Music; and Religions and Theology). The other Schools are <em>Combined Studies</em>; <em>Education</em>; <em>Environment and Development</em>; <em><a>Architecture</a></em>; <em>Languages, Linguistics and Cultures</em>; <em>Law</em>; <em>Social Sciences</em> and the <em><a>Manchester Business School</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Faculty of Life Sciences</a></strong> unusually consisting of a single school.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Major projects</h3>
<p>[[Image:MIBatrium.jpg|thumb|The atrium inside the new &#x00a3;38m [[Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre]]]] Following the merger, the University embarked on a &#x00a3;600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x00a3;60 m Flagship <em>University Place</em> building</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;56 m <a>Alan Turing Building</a>: housing <a>Mathematics</a>, the Photon Sciences Institute and the <a>Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics</a>.</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;50 m Life Sciences Research Building (A.V. Hill Building)</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;38 m <a>Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre</a> (MIB)</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;33 m Life Sciences and Medical and Human Sciences Building (Michael Smith Building)</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;31 m Humanities Building - now officially called the &quot;<a>Arthur Lewis Building</a>&quot;</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;20 m <a>Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre</a> (WMIC)</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;18 m Re-location of School of Pharmacy</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;17 m <a>John Rylands Library</a>, Deansgate</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;13 m Chemistry Building</li>
  <li>&#x00a3;10 m Functional Biology Building</li>
</ul>
<h3>John Rylands University Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|105px|The John Rylands Library, from Deansgate: Spinningfield Square to left</a>  The university's library, the <a>John Rylands</a> University Library, is the largest non-<a>legal deposit</a> library in the UK, as well as being the UK's third-largest academic library after those of <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>. It also has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK. items sourced from around the world. Collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from <a>Australia</a>, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the <a>Mediterranean</a>, and beetles, armour and <a>archery</a> from <a>Asia</a>. In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised <em><a>Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em> called &quot;Stan&quot;.</p>
<p>The history of the museum goes back to 1821, when the first collections were assembled by the Manchester Society of <a>Natural History</a> and later added by the collections of the Manchester <a>Geological</a> Society. Due to financial difficulties and on the advice of the great evolutionary biologist <a>Thomas Huxley</a>, <a>Owens College</a> accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a>, the architect of London&#x2019;s <a>Natural History Museum</a>, to design a museum to house these collections for the benefit of students and the public on a new site in Oxford Road. The Manchester Museum was finally opened to the public in the late 1880s.</p>
<h3>Whitworth Art Gallery</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|The Whitworth Art Gallery</a> The Whitworth Art Gallery is home to collections of internationally famous British watercolours, textiles and wallpapers, as well as  modern and historic prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture. It overall contains 31,000 items in its collection. A programme of temporary exhibitions runs throughout the year, with the Mezzanine Court serving as a venue for showing sculpture. It was founded by Robert Darbishire with a donation from Sir <a>Joseph Whitworth</a> in 1889, as <em>The Whitworth Institute and Park</em>. 70 years later the gallery became official part of the University of Manchester. In October 1995 a Mezzanine Court in the centre of the building was opened. This new gallery, designed chiefly for the display of sculptures, won a <a>RIBA</a> regional award.</p>
<h3>Manchester University Press</h3>
<p> <a>Manchester University Press</a> is an academic publishing house which exists as part of the university. It publishes academic <a>monograph</a>s as well as textbooks and journals, the majority of which are works from authors based elsewhere in the international academic community, and is the third largest university press in England after <a>Oxford University Press</a> and <a>Cambridge University Press</a>.</p>
<h3>Contact Theatre</h3>
<p>[[Image:Contact Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[Contact Theatre]]]] <a>thumbnail|The Old Quadrangle</a> The Contact Theatre largely stages modern live performance and participatory work for younger audiences. The present fortress-style building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 but incorporates parts of its 1960s predecessor.  It features a unique energy-efficient system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning. The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and <em>Hot Air</em>, a reactive public artwork in the foyer.</p>
<h3>Old Quadrangle</h3>
<p>The buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a <a>Gothic</a> style by <a>Alfred Waterhouse</a> (and his son <a>Paul Waterhouse</a>). The first to be built (in 1873) was the John Owens Building (formerly the Main Building: the others were added over the next thirty years. In fact, the Rear Quadrangle is older than the Old Quadrangle. Today, <a>the museum</a> continues to occupy part of one side (including the tower) and the grand setting of the <a>Whitworth Hall</a> is used for the conferment of degrees. Part of the old <a>Christie Library</a> (1898) now houses Christie's Bistro, and the remainder of the buildings house administrative departments.</p>
<h3>Chancellors Hotel and Conference Centre</h3>
<p>  <a>thumb|left|Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre</a> Formerly named The Firs, the original house was built in 1850 for <a>Sir Joseph Whitworth</a> by <a>Edward Walters</a>, who was also responsible for Manchester&#x2019;s <a>Free Trade Hall</a> and <a>Strangeways Prison</a>. Whitworth used The Firs mainly as a social, political and business base, entertaining radicals of the age such as <a>John Bright</a>, <a>Richard Cobden</a>, <a>William Forster</a> and <a>T.H. Huxley</a> at the time of the <a>Reform Bill</a> of 1867. Whitworth, credited with raising the art of machine-tool building to a previously-unknown level, supported the new <a>Mechanics Institute</a> in Manchester &#x2013; the birthplace of <a>UMIST</a> - and helped to found the Manchester School of Design. Whilst living in the house, Whitworth used land to the rear (now the site of the University's botanical glasshouses) for testing his &quot;<a>Whitworth rifle</a>&quot;.  In 1882, the Firs was leased to <a>C.P. Scott</a>, Editor of the <a>Manchester Guardian</a>. After Scott's death the house became the property of <a>Owens College</a>, and was the Vice-Chancellor's residence until 1991. The old house now forms the western wing of Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre at the University. The newer eastern wing houses the circular Flowers Theatre, six individual conference rooms and the majority of the 75 hotel bedrooms.</p>
<h3>Residential accommodation</h3>
<p><a>thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;Ashburne Hall, a catered accommodation offered mainly to undergraduate students, though some places are reserved for postgraduate students&lt;/center&gt;</a> Before they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.</p>
<h4>Main campus</h4>
<p>;Whitworth Park Halls of Residence These halls are owned by the University of Manchester and house 1,085 students of that university. It is most notable for the unique triangular shape of the accommodation blocks which gave rise to the nickname of &quot;Toblerones&quot;, after the <a>chocolate bar</a>.</p>
<p>The designer of these unique 'Toblerone' shaped buildings took his inspiration from the hill which has been there since 1962, when as a result of a nearby archaeological dig (led by John Gater) the hill was created from the excavated soil. A consequence of this triangular design was a much reduced cost for the contracted construction company. Due to a deal struck between the University and Manchester City Council, which meant that the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area, Allan Pluen's team is believed to have saved thousands on the final cost of the halls. They were built in the mid 1970s.</p>
<p>It is also said by <a>alumni</a>, that the then University of Victoria got a grant for building the halls, and the then government would pay for the roof if they paid for the rest, hence they made very large roofs and not many bricks.</p>
<p><a>thumb|150 px|&lt;center&gt;Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence&lt;/center&gt;</a> The site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names given to the halls. Grove House is a much older building and has been used by the University for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the <a>Manchester University Press</a>. The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.</p>
<p>Notable people associated with the halls are <a>Friedrich Engels</a> whose residence on the site is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist <a>Brian Cox</a>; <a>Irene Khan</a>, Secretary general of Amnesty International; and <em>Big Brother</em> winner <a>Omar Chaparro</a>.</p>
<p>;Sackville Street The former UMIST Campus has five halls of residence near to <a>Sackville Street</a> building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, Chandos, and Wright Robinson), and several other halls within a 5-15 minute walk away, such as the Grosvenor group of halls. </p>
<p>;Other accommodation The former Moberly Tower has been demolished. There are also Vaughan House (once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name)and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall in Higher Cambridge Street.</p>
<h4>Fallowfield and Victoria Park Campuses</h4>
<p>The <a>Fallowfield Campus</a>, situated 2 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) south of the main university campus (the Oxford Road Campus), is the largest of the university's residential campuses. The <a>Owens Park</a> group of halls with its landmark tower lies at the centre of it, while <a>Oak House</a> is another large hall of residence. Woolton Hall is also on the Fallowfield campus next to Oak House. <a>Allen Hall</a> is a traditional hall situated near <a>Ashburne Hall</a> (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne). Richmond Park is also a relatively recent addition to the campus.</p>
<p><a>Victoria Park</a> Campus, comprises several halls of residence. Among these are <a>St Anselm Hall</a>  with Canterbury Court and Pankhurst Court, <a>Dalton-Ellis Hall</a> , <a>Hulme Hall</a> (including Burkhardt House), <a>St Gabriel's Hall</a> and Opal Gardens Hall. St Anselm Hall is the only all-male hall left in the <a>United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<h2>Research and reputation</h2>
<p>The university has a very high quality research profile and is counted among the leading universities in the world. It is included in the Sutton Trust's list of highly selective 'elite' UK institutions. In the first national assessment of higher education research since the university&#x2019;s founding, the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, the University of Manchester came 3rd in terms of research power after Cambridge and Oxford and 6th for grade point average quality (8th when including specialist institutions). (these five universities being informally referred to as the 'golden diamond' of research-intensive UK institutions). Manchester also has a particularly strong presence in terms of funding from the three main UK research councils, <a>EPSRC</a>, <a>MRC</a> and <a>BBSRC</a>, being ranked 3rd, 7th and 1st respectively. In addition, the university is also one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: at a recent rank it was placed at 3rd place behind Oxbridge. </p>
<p>Historically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had <a>25 Nobel Laureates</a> among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom behind <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>; in fact, excluding Oxbridge, Manchester has graduated more <a>Nobel laureates</a> than any other university in the UK. Purely in terms of <a>Nobel prize winners</a> Manchester is ranked 9th in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the University (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill). The university currently employs 4 Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK.</p>
<p>The 2009 <a>THE - QS World University Rankings</a> found Manchester overall 26th in the world. It was also ranked by the same report 5th internationally by employer reviews (along with <a>MIT</a> and <a>Stanford</a> and ahead of <a>Yale</a> and <a>Cornell</a>) by receiving a maximum 100% rating which the university has retained since 2008. The separate 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings) found that Manchester had slipped to 30th overall in the world.</p>
<p>The <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> 2008 published by the Institute of Higher Education of <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> ranked Manchester 5th in the UK, 6th in Europe and 40th in the world.  After several years of steady progress Manchester fell back in 2009 to 41st in the world and 7th in Europe, falling back further to 44th in the world and 9th in Europe in 2010. Excluding US universities, Manchester is ranked 13th and 11th in the world for 2009 by THES and ARWU respectively.  According to the ARWU rankings the university is ranked 9th in Europe for natural sciences and 4th in engineering. Similarly the <a>HEEACT</a> 2009 rankings for scientific performance place Manchester 5th in Europe for engineering, 8th for natural sciences and 3rd for social sciences. And finally THES ranks Manchester 6th in Europe for technology, 10th for life sciences and 7th for social sciences. More recently a survey by the Times Higher Education Supplement has shown that Manchester is placed 6th in Europe in the area of Psychology &amp; Psychiatry. According to a further ranking by SCImago Research Group Manchester is ranked 8th in Europe amongst higher education institutions in terms of sheer research output. In terms of research impact a further ranking places Manchester 6th in Europe. Manchester is also one of only seven universities in Europe which are rated Excellent in all seven main academic departments (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Economics and Political Science) by the 2010 Centre for Higher Education's Development's Excellence Rankings.</p>
<p>According to the High Fliers Research Limited's survey, University of Manchester students are being targeted by more top recruiters for graduate vacancies than any other UK university students for three consecutive years (2007&#x2013;2009). Furthermore the university has been ranked joint 20th in the world for 2009 according to the Professional Ranking of World Universities. Its main compilation criterion is the number of Chief Executive Officers (or number 1 executive equivalent) which are among the &quot;500 leading worldwide companies&quot; as measured by revenue who studied in each university. The ranking places the University only behind Oxford nationally. Manchester is ranked 5th among British universities according to a popularity ranking which is based on the degree of traffic that a university's website attracts. Also a further report places Manchester within the top 20 universities outside the US.</p>
<p>At a recent ranking undertaken by the Guardian, Manchester is placed 5th in the UK in international reputation behind the usual four: Oxbridge, UCL and Imperial. However, while as a rule world rankings (such as the ARWU, THES and HEEACT) typically place the university within the top 10 in Europe, national studies are less complementary; The Times 'Good University Guide 2011&#x2019; ranked Manchester 30th out of 113 Universities in the UK, &#x2018;The Complete University Guide&#x2019;2011 in association with The Independent placed it at 31st out of 115 universities whilst &#x2018;The Guardian University Guide 2011&#x2019; ranked Manchester at 51st out of 118 universities in the UK. This apparent paradox is mainly a reflection of the different ranking methodologies employed by each listing: global rankings focus on research and international prestige, whereas national rankings are largely based on teaching and the student experience. &lt;!-- Please see discussion thread. Perhaps put long list of rankings, if necessary at all, into a separate (sub-)article. Otherwise it is larger than the history section.--&gt;</p>
<h2>Clubs and societies</h2>
<p> [[Image:Manchester University Boat Club.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The University's Boat Club is one of many Athletic Union Clubs that Manchester offers.]]</p>
<h3>Athletics and outdoor games</h3>
<p>Unlike some universities The University of Manchester operates its own sports clubs via the <a>Athletics Union</a>. Student societies on the other hand are operated by the <a>Students' Union</a>.</p>
<p>Today the university can boast more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs. The sports societies in Manchester vary widely in their level and scope. Many of the more popular sports have several university teams as well as departmental teams which may be placed in a league against other teams within the university. Common teams include: <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>korfball</a>, <a>dodgeball</a>, <a>hockey</a>, <a>rugby league</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>netball</a> and <a>cricket</a>. The <a>Manchester Aquatics Centre</a>, the <a>swimming pool</a> used for the <a>Manchester Commonwealth Games</a> is also on the campus.</p>
<p>The university competes annually in 28 different sports against <a>Leeds</a> and <a>Liverpool</a> universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years. The university has also achieved considerable success in the <a>BUCS</a> (British University &amp; College Sports) competitions. It is currently positioned in 8th place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10 The <a>Christie Cup</a> is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie's Championships is the oldest Inter&#x2013;University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of <a>Richard Copley Christie</a>.</p>
<p>Every year elite sportsmen and sportswomen at the university are selected for membership of the <em>XXI Club</em>, a society that was formed in 1932 and exists to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a <a>Full Maroon</a> for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level.</p>
<h3>Political activity, social sciences and performing arts</h3>
<p>Manchester also has a reputation for producing many active members of the <a>Labour Party</a>. Former students have included <a>Phil Woolas</a>, <a>John Mann</a>, <a>Margaret Beckett</a> and <a>Liam Byrne</a>.</p>
<p>Manchester has the largest degree programme in the country in the School of Social Sciences. It has a unique degree programme under the umbrella name of BA(Econ and Social Sciences). It is a multidisciplinary degree designed to give students maximum flexibility and choice. Within it, students can specialise in, or combine it with, other social science disciplines, such as economics, business studies, politics, or sociology. The course is fortunate by having a long, distinguished history in Economics, with a Chair in Political Economy founded at Manchester in 1854. There is an extensive choice of course units, thanks to the significant diversity of interests of Manchester staff.</p>
<p>The BA(Econ and Social Sciences) programme has its own society, BA Econ Society, the largest course-based society in the country. The society boasts around 1000 active members offering a variety of opportunities including different socials (from bar crawls to BBQs, from trips to Alton Towers to nights out in neighbouring cities), career events (with a long list of corporate sponsors and array of development, political and government-based links), a large international offering for students new to the UK, an annual trip abroad and huge Summer Ball. The society is one of the most established at the university with strong representative sports teams (hockey, football, netball and rugby) and good links with the academic staff at the School of Social Sciences.</p>
<p>In addition to this the university is also home to Manchester University Music Society (MUMS) which promotes many classical and jazz ensembles including MUWO (Manchester University Wind Orchestra), a large wind orchestra whose members include present students, alumni and other wind players in the Manchester area. The band were awarded Gold at the National Concert Band Festival at <a>The Sage Gateshead</a> in 2007 and again at <a>Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama</a> in 2009.  In 2008 the University of Manchester Symphony Orchestra (a MUMS ensemble) was a finalist in the inter-University Symphony orchestra competition SymphUni.  In 2009 MUMS appointed <a>Sir Peter Maxwell Davies</a> to be their patron.</p>
<h3>University Challenge</h3>
<p>The university has done particularly well in recent years on <a>BBC2</a> quiz program <em><a>University Challenge</a></em>. In <a>2006</a>, Manchester beat <a>Trinity Hall, Cambridge</a> to record the university's first triumph in the competition. <a>The year after</a>, the university finished in 2nd place after losing out to the <a>University of Warwick</a> in the final. The team has progressed to the semi finals every year since 2005.</p>
<p>In <a>2009</a>, the team battled hard in the final against <a>Corpus Christi College, Oxford</a>. At the gong, the score was 275 - 190 to Corpus Christi College after an extraordinary performance from <a>Gail Trimble</a>. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated 8 months before the final was broadcast, and the team was disqualified.</p>
<p>Manchester reached the semi-finals in the <a>2010</a> competition before being beaten by <a>Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a>.</p>
<h2>Medicine</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Old Medical School on Coupland Street (photographed in 1908), which now houses the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences</a> The <a>Manchester Medical School</a>, established in 1874, is one of  the largest in the country, with over 400 medical students being trained in each of the clinical years and over 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. Approximately 100 students who have completed pre-clinical training at the <a>Bute Medical School</a> (<a>University of St Andrews</a>) join the third year of the undergraduate medical programme each year.</p>
<p>The university's <a>Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences</a> has links with a large number of <a>NHS</a> hospitals in the <a>North West of England</a> and maintains presences in its four base hospitals: <a>Manchester Royal Infirmary</a> (located at the southern end of the main university campus on Oxford Road), <a>Wythenshawe Hospital</a>, <a>Hope Hospital</a> and the <a>Royal Preston Hospital</a>. All are used for clinical medical training for doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>The School of Pharmacy also benefits from the university's links with the Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals. All of the undergraduate pharmacy students gain hospital experience through these links and are the only pharmacy students in the UK to have an extensive course completed in secondary care.</p>
<p>Moreover, the university is a founding partner of the <a>Manchester Academic Health Science Centre</a>, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester.</p>
<h2>Notable academic staff and alumni</h2>
<p> :<em>see also</em> <a>List of University of Manchester people</a> &lt;!-- Of course there are some people who need to be added to this section but we must keep it short. As a general rule add people to the main article, only put them here if they are really well known, major world leaders, Nobel prize winners, people that most educated people will have heard of. --&gt;</p>
<p>Many notable and famous people have worked or studied at one or both of the two former institutions that merged to form the University of Manchester, including 25 <a>Nobel prize</a> laureates. Some of the best known include <a>John Dalton</a> (founder of modern atomic theory), <a>Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> (considered the one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century), <a>George E. Davis</a> (founded the discipline of <a>Chemical Engineering</a>), <a>Bernard Lovell</a> (a pioneer of <a>radio astronomy</a>), <a>Alan Turing</a> (one of the founders of <a>computer science</a> and <a>artificial intelligence</a>), <a>Irene Khan</a> (current secretary general of <a>Amnesty International</a>) and <a>Robert Bolt</a> (two times <a>Academy Award</a> winner and three times <a>Golden Globe</a> winner for screenwriting <em><a>Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> and <em><a>Doctor Zhivago</a></em>). Additionally, a number of politicians are associated with the university, including the current Presidents of <a>Belize</a>, <a>Iceland</a> and <a>Trinidad and Tobago</a>, as well as several ministers among others in the United Kingdom, <a>Malaysia</a>, Canada and <a>Singapore</a> and also <a>Chaim Weizmann</a>, a chemist and the first President of <a>Israel</a>.</p>
