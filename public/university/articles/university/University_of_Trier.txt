<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Historical university</h3>
<p>In 1455, <a>Pope Nicholas V</a> granted the archbishop of Trier, <a>Jakob von Sierck</a>, to establish a university in his town. The <em>University of Trier</em> was founded March 16, 1473. Battling with financial problems for decades, the university was acquired by the <a>Jesuits</a> in 1560. They emphasized the <a>philosophical</a> and <a>theological</a> faculties, at the expense of <a>medicine</a> and <a>law</a>. In the 1580s <a>Peter Binsfeld</a> was president of the university. In the 1730s <a>Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim</a> also was a faculty member. After the <a>french occupation of the Rhineland</a>, the French administration ordered the Universities of <a>Cologne</a>, <a>Mainz</a> and <a>Bonn</a> closed. The historical University of Trier was closed on April 6, 1798.</p>
<h3>Modern university</h3>
<p>In 1970 the university was refounded as part of the twin-University Trier / <a>Kaiserslautern</a>. It graduated 360 students on October 15, 1970. In 1975 the partners separated and formed independent institutions. In 1977 the new university campus in <a>Tarforst</a> was opened. During the 1990s a former hospital complex was added, and dubbed <em>Campus II</em>.</p>
<h3>University seal</h3>
<p>The modern university still uses the seal of the historical university in its corporate design [<a>http://www.uni-trier.de/uni/siegel.htm</a>]. It contains the Latin motto &quot;&quot; (God completes the favors of wisdom from the city of Trier). In 2000 an alternative logo [<a>http://www.uni-trier.de/Home/home_unisignet_450_214a.gif</a>] incorporating that seal was introduced, but this met with resistance.</p>

<p>While there are many foreign students in Trier, a large majority of students hails from <a>Rhineland-Palatinate</a> and the adjacent states of <a>Saarland</a> and <a>Northrhine-Westphalia</a>. This effect is supported by the introduction of <a>Tuition</a> fees in all German  states except for Rhineland-Palatine. The <a>SPD</a> who is currently ruling the state does not plan to introduce Tuition so far.</p>
<h2>Karl-Marx-University Trier</h2>
<p>The <a>AStA</a><img> proposed changing the name of the University to <em><a>Karl-Marx</a>-Universit&#x00e4;t Trier</em>, honoring the city's most famous son. Although the proposal was finally rejected, the AStA still refers to the university as &quot;Karl-Marx-Universit&#x00e4;t Trier&quot;.</p>
