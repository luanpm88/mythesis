<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Plymouth</strong> is the largest <a>university</a> in the <a>South West of England</a>, with over 30,000 students and is 9th largest in the United Kingdom by total number of students (including the <a>Open University</a>). It has almost 3,000 staff (one of the largest employers in the southwest). The main campus is in the <a>Devon</a> city of <a>Plymouth</a>, but the university has campuses and affiliated colleges all over <a>South West England</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was originally a <a>Polytechnic College</a>, with its constituent bodies being <a>Plymouth Polytechnic</a>, Rolle College, the Exeter School of Art and Design (which were, before April 1989, run by <a>Devon County Council</a>) and Seale-Hayne College (which before April 1989 was an independent charity). It was renamed Polytechnic South West in 1989 and remained as this until gaining university status in 1992 along with the other polytechnics. The new university absorbed the Plymouth School of Maritime Studies and Tavistock College.</p>
<p>In 2006 part of the remains of the <a>World War II</a> Portland Square <a>air-raid shelter</a> were rediscovered on the Plymouth campus. On the night of 22 April 1941, during <a>the Blitz</a>, a bomb fell here killing over 70 civilians, including a mother and her six children.  He was temporarily replaced by <a>Professor Mark Cleary</a> (now VC of the <a>University of Bradford</a>), and then by Professor Steve Newstead. Professor Wendy Purcell became VC on 1 December 2007.</p>
<p>The University was selected by the <a>Royal Statistical Society</a> in October 2008 to home its Centre for Statistical Education.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Construction of the new Arts Complex on the Rowe Street building site at the Southern end of campus.</a> When university status was gained in 1992, the university was based in various locations. Under then Vice-Chancellor Roland Levinsky, the university began a policy of centralising its campus activities in Plymouth. The Faculty of Arts based in Exmouth moved to the new Roland Levinsky arts building in August 2007, bringing subjects including Fine Art, History of Art, Photography and 3-D Design to Plymouth. Theatre &amp; Performance, based in Exmouth also moved at this time. The Roland Levinsky Building was designed by architects <a>Henning Larsen</a> with <a>Building Design Partnership</a>. The building is <a>clad with copper sheets</a> in a seamed-cladding technique, is nine storeys high and has  of floor space.</p>
<p>An exception to the trend of centralising activities are the University's extensive activities in education for the health professions. In addition many of its students are taught at Further Education Colleges throughout <a>Devon</a>, <a>Cornwall</a> and <a>Somerset</a>, such as South Devon College. <a>Dartington College of Arts</a> has been cited as an example but was an independent college of higher education and not a further education college. A new building which opened in 2008 is shared between the <a>Peninsula Medical School</a> and the Faculty of Health and Social Work, highlighting some movement towards Plymouth. </p>
<p>Recently completed developments include Portland Square, a library extension, refurbished and new laboratory and teaching facilities in many of the campus buildings, halls of residence near the Business School and a new &#x00a3;16&nbsp;million Peninsula Medical School headquarters at Derriford, in the north of the city.</p>
<h3>Student accommodation</h3>
<p>For first year students, halls of residence and cluster flats are approved by the university. About 60% of first year students can gain a room in these facilities. </p>
<p>The <a>University Partnership Programme</a> (UPP) supplies and manages the student halls of residence at the university. Cluster flat developments close to the university are owned and managed by Unite plc. Places are allocated exclusively to first year students.</p>
<p>The university provides an approved accommodation database. Approximately half of all first year students and virtually all second and third years choose their accommodation from the approved database. Special accommodation arrangements are made for students in some categories, such as postgraduate students and students with medical conditions.</p>
<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>
<p>Plymouth is a modern university that has undergone a great deal of development, including several new buildings. </p>
<p>Jointly with the <a>University of Exeter</a> and the <a>National Health Service</a> in the region, the University runs the recently founded <a>Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry</a>. A new &#x00a3;13&nbsp;million building on the University of Plymouth's main campus provides teaching rooms, office space, a clinical skills laboratory and research facilities for the Plymouth-based activities of the School, along with the Faculty of Health and Social work.</p>
<h3>Coat of arms</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|University of Plymouth Coat of Arms.</a> The <a>Arms, Crest, Badge and Supporters</a> forming the University&#x2019;s <a>Coat of Arms</a> were granted on 10 April 2008, in Grant 173/189, by the <a>College of Arms</a>.</p>
<p>The books represent the University&#x2019;s focus on learning and scholarship. The scattering of small stars, represent <a>navigation</a>, which has played a key role in the history of the city and the university. The scallop shells in gold, represents pilgrimage, a sign of the importance of the departure of the <a>Pilgrim Fathers</a> from a site near the <a>Mayflower Steps</a> in the <a>Barbican</a> aboard the <a>Mayflower</a> in 1620. A Pelican and a <a>Golden Hind</a> support the shield and reflect both the original and later, better known, name of <a>Sir Francis Drake</a>&#x2019;s <a>ship</a>. The crest contains the Latin motto, &quot;Indagate Fingite Invenite&#x201d; which translates as &quot;Explore Dream Discover&quot; and is a quote from <a>Mark Twain</a>, reflecting the university's ambitions for its students and Plymouth's history of great seafarers.</p>
<p>The <a>Letters Patent</a> granting <a>Arms</a> to the University of Plymouth were presented by <a>Eric Dancer</a>, <a>CBE</a>, <a>JP</a>, <a>Lord Lieutenant</a> of <a>Devon</a>, in a ceremony at the University on 27 November 2008, in the presence of <a>Henry Paston-Bedingfeld</a>, <a>York Herald</a> of the <a>College of Arms</a>, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Plymouth, Judge William Taylor, the Recorder of Plymouth, and <a>Baroness Judith Wilcox</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Coat of Arms</a> are rarely seen in use, other than at graduation. The university tends to use the modern globe logo on stationery and signs and are very keen to keep the <a>Coat of Arms</a> exclusive. The use of the arms is therefore restricted to graduations and other formal ceremonies, degree certificates and associated materials and the exclusive use by the Office of the Vice-Chancellor.</p>
