<p></p>
<p>, or  is a <a>private university</a> in <a>Kyoto</a>, <a>Japan</a>. It has 24,000 students on three campuses, in faculties of <a>theology</a>, letters, <a>law</a>, commerce, <a>economics</a>, policy, and <a>engineering</a>. It also has graduate programs in American studies and policy and management. Tuition and fees average &#x00a5;850,000 a year for liberal arts majors, and are higher for science and engineering majors.</p>
<p>It was founded by an ex-<a>samurai</a> named <a>Niijima J&#x014d;</a>. Niijima left <a>feudal</a> Japan illegally in 1864, at the age of twenty-one, and found his way to <a>Boston, Massachusetts</a>, where he attended <a>Phillips Academy</a>, <a>Amherst College</a>, and <a>Andover Theological Seminary</a> under the name <a>Joseph Hardy Neesima</a>. After he returned to a westernizing Japan in 1875, he founded Doshisha English School in Kyoto. Canadian <a>Methodist</a> missionary G. G. Cochran played a role in the establishment of Doshisha University, and his contribution to the improvement of Japan's educational system is considered an important episode in the early history of Japanese-Canadian relations.  The institution took its present form in by incorporating a law school, normal school, and women's college.</p>
<p>By 1920, Doshisha was a full-fledged university in the Anglo-American tradition. During <a>World War II</a>, its buildings were given Japanese names and its curriculum was stripped of its pro-Western elements, but the pre-war conditions were restored after Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>Amherst College has maintained close ties with Doshisha since its founding. Amherst and Doshisha are considered sister schools and have had a long running student and faculty exchange program that was interrupted only by the Second World War. Additionally, Doshisha collaborates with a consortium of prestigious American liberal arts colleges (including Amherst) to host the <a>Associated Kyoto Program</a>, an 8-month long study abroad program offered every year to students of American colleges.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The spirit of foundation</h3>
<p>The foundation spirit of Doshisha is a <a>conscience</a> based on Christianity. <a>Niijima Jo</a> encouraged to educate <em>ones who can drive abilities with conscience</em> as a purpose of foundation. In order not to be biased with an education of knowledge, he wished to produce <em>ones who are filled with full of conscience from head to foot</em> with a moral education based on Christianity side by side. The monuments which the thought of him carved with his actual handwriting are placed to the front entrance of both Imadegawa and Kyotanabe campuses. In the conscience monuments, words of &quot; Wish sturdy who is filled with full of conscience all over arises and comes &quot; are carved in Japanese. Also, for actualizing the conscience education concretely, aiming to send one who is a conscience of country to the world through Christianity, <a>Liberalism</a> and <a>Internationalism</a>. <a>thumb|The monument of conscience in Imadegawa campus.</a></p>
