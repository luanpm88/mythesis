<p>The <strong>University of Maine</strong> (<strong>UMaine</strong>) Having an enrollment of approximately 12,000 students, UMaine is the largest university in the state and is the only institution in Maine classified as a <a>research university</a> (RU/H) by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>. The University of Maine's athletic teams are nicknamed the Black Bears, and sport blue and white uniforms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Brick Hall (1871), later renamed Oak Hall, burned in 1936</a> UMaine was founded in 1862 as a function of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, signed by President <a>Lincoln</a>. Established in 1865 and originally named the Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the Maine College opened on September 21, 1868, changing its name to the University of Maine in 1897.</p>
<p>By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master's degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor's degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school. </p>
<p><a>right|300px|thumb|Stevens Hall</a> Near the end of the 19th century, the curriculum was expanded to place greater emphasis on <a>liberal arts</a>. As a function of this shift in focus new faculty hired during the early 20th century included <a>Caroline Colvin</a>, chair of the history department, and the first woman in the nation to head a major university department.</p>
<p>In 1906, <a>The Senior Skull Honor Society</a> was founded to &quot;publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1973, the <a>Wilde Stein Alliance for Sexual Diversity</a> was founded as one of the first gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender student organizations in the United States and the first in the state of Maine.</p>
<p>When the <a>University of Maine System</a> was incorporated, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono (or UMO). This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>UMaine is the flagship of the University of Maine System. The senior administration of the university consists of President Robert A. Kennedy, Provost Sue Hunter, Vice-President for Administration Janet Waldron, Vice-President for Research Michael Eckhardt, and Dean of Students Robert Dana. The senior administration governs cooperatively with the Chancellor of the University of Maine system, Richard L. Pattenaude and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the Governor of Maine and one is the current Maine State Commissioner of Education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the Chancellor and each university President, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates/operating budgets. </p>
<p>UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated. Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987. They are classified as a 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation. It consists of a legislative branch, which passes resolutions, and an executive branch, which helps organize on-campus entertainment and guest speakers, works with new and existing student organizations, and performs other duties. Other organizations fall under the umbrella of Student Government Inc., including representative boards, community associations, and many other student groups. <a>The Maine Campus</a>, the student newspaper, is also incorporated and does not operate under or receive money from student government.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Location and layout</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|A tree lined path through the Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens</a></p>
<p>Situated on Marsh Island, between the <a>Penobscot</a> and <a>Stillwater</a> rivers, the University of Maine is the only Land Grant University in the nation located on an island. Occupying the small town of Orono, population ~8,500, the  campus The campus is equipped with thirty-seven academic buildings, thirty administrative buildings, eighteen residence halls, eighteen specific laboratory facilities, fourteen Greek life houses, ten sports facilities, five museums, four dining facilities, two convenience stores, a student union, a cafe, a pub, an  recreation and fitness center, and a 200'x200' air supported athletic/recreational dome.</p>
<p>The center of the campus is occupied by the University of Maine Mall, an open grassy area between the Raymond H. Fogler Library and the University Memorial Field House. The mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls. The campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop), all of which are within close proximity to (or border directly on) the mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the <a>Alfond Arena</a>(ice hockey), <a>Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium</a> (field hockey, football, track and field), <a>Mahaney Diamond</a> (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings that occupy the northern section of campus include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls. The southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the Maynard F. Jordan Observatory, Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls. The recently renovated <a>Collins Center for the Arts</a> is also located on the southern part of campus, and not only provides the Hutchins Concert Hall, a 1,435 seat venue for performing artists from around the world, but also houses the <a>Hudson Museum</a>, known for its contemporary <a>Native American</a> art, as well as displays that are culturally specific to the ancient indigenous people of Maine. The Hilltop section of campus is populated largely with residence halls but also includes the  Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens, as well as academic and recreational facilities.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Maine Black Bears logo</a> </p>
<p>The University of Maine participates in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> level, and is a member of the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a> for <a>football</a>, <a>Hockey East</a> for <a>ice hockey</a>, and the <a>America East Conference</a> for all other sports.  The school has won two national championships, both in <a>men's ice hockey</a>. In 1993, they defeated Lake Superior State University 5-4 behind a third period hat trick by Jim Montgomery. In 1999, they defeated rival <a>University of New Hampshire</a> 3-2 in overtime on a goal by Marcus Gustafsson.</p>
<p>In 1965, the football team competed in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida against East Carolina. They were beaten in the game 31-0, but remain the only team from Maine to compete in a bowl contest.</p>
<p>The official <a>fight song</a> of UMaine is the &#x201c;Stein Song&#x201d;.  Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when <a>Rudy Vallee</a> arranged the current version.  Vallee attended Maine from 1921&#x2013;1922 before transferring to <a>Yale</a>, and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite.  To this day, the &quot;Stein Song&quot; remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930.  According to <em>College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology</em>, by Studwell and Schueneman, the &quot;Stein Song&quot; is one of the very best fight songs of all time.</p>
