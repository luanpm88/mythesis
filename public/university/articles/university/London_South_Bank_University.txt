<h2>History</h2>

<p>LSBU's history stretches back to the late 19th century. Even though it has undergone several name changes, becoming the Polytechnic of the South Bank in 1970, South Bank Polytechnic in 1987, South Bank University in 1992 and London South Bank University in 2003 and merged with a number of other educational institutions, its focus is still to provide excellence in professional education and training underpinned by relevant research.</p>
<p>It was born, as were a number of other <a>Polytechnics</a>, from the perceived need to fill a skills gap at the end of the nineteenth century. In June 1888, the South London Polytechnics Committee, which sat on the <a>London School Board</a> (whose members included the <a>Lord Mayor of London</a>, <a>Lord Salisbury</a>, <a>Lord Rosebery</a> and <a>Sir Lyon Playfair</a>) met at <a>Mansion House</a> to motion that they approved &quot;of a Scheme for the establishment in South London of Polytechnic Institutes&quot;. Two years later in 1890 the former buildings of <a>Joseph Lancaster</a>'s British &amp; Foreign Schools Society were bought for &#x00a3;20,000 to form a new polytechnic. In May that year, the <a>South London Polytechnics Institutes Act</a> was passed, so that by June 1891 the governing structure and general aims were created for the future Borough Polytechnic. These aims were &quot;the promotion of the industrial skills, general knowledge, health, and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes&quot; and also for &quot;instruction suitable for persons intending to emigrate&quot;. By January 1892, &#x00a3;78,000 had been raised for the new Battersea and Borough Polytechnics and W.M.Richardson had been chosen to be clerk to the Governing Body. Mr C. T. Millis was appointed as Headmaster and Miss Helen Smith appointed Lady Superintendent. Edric Bayley was appointed the first Chair of Governors.</p>
<p>On 30 September 1892, the Polytechnic opened as the Borough Polytechnic Institute, with a remit to educate the local community in a range of practical skills. The Polytechnic was given a seal based on the Bridge House emblem of the <a>City of London</a> and a motto taken from Ecclesiastes &#x2014; &quot;Do it with thy Might&quot;.  A Gala event was held to mark the occasion, opened by Lord Rosebery which was widely reported in the press.  One of the speeches made included the hope that &quot;the Polytechnic would do its share towards perfecting many a valuable gem found in the slums of London&quot;. Such a comment came from the terrible social conditions found in Southwark at the time which were described as containing &quot;Dirt, Damp, Dissipation and Destitution&quot;.</em></p>
<p>The Polytechnic had classes in art, science, language, literature and general knowledge as well as holding public lectures, musical entertainments, exhibitions, sporting facilities, clubs, a museum and a library.  A weekly printed journal supplied news of events and societies sprang up in debating, literature, economics, photography, chess, draughts, antiquarianism and natural history.  Popular courses included tanning, typography, metalwork, electrical engineering, baking, and boot &amp; shoe manufacture. <a>George Bernard Shaw</a>, J. A. Hobson and Henry M. Stanley all lectured at the Polytechnic in the 1890s. Business; Arts and Human Sciences, and Engineering, Science and the Built Environment. Many courses hold national accreditation and can lead to entry into a wide selection of professions.</p>
<p>The end of 2009 saw it open K2, a major new building that is highly sustainable and features the Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB).  </p>
<p>The university continues to serve its original purpose of educating in a very practical way. It takes the future employability of its students very seriously and works with employers and industry experts to ensure course content is highly relevant.  The institution's celebrated teacher, the British <a>painter</a> <a>David Bomberg</a> taught painting and drawing at the Borough Polytechnic between 1945 and 1954. The university's hall of residence, <a>David Bomberg House</a>, carries his name. Major paintings by Bomberg were acquired by the <a>Tate Gallery</a> only after his death.</p>
<p>Today, LSBU is a unique university with strong ties with its local community. It upholds its aim of providing fair and equal access to a university education to all those who have the potential to succeed or benefit from it. In 2010, it again holds its position of being ranked 6th in the UK for graduate starting salaries. LSBU has the most KTP activity of any London university and is currently ranked third in the UK for the number of <a>Knowledge Transfer Programme</a>s it runs. In total, its currently managing funds for its projects in excess of &#x00a3;6.2 million. The university is engaged in a 15-year development programme to enhance its campuses and to provide world class facilities for its students and staff. The University is almost at the end of a programme to invest nearly &#x00a3;50m in landmark projects at its Southwark campus.</p>
<p>With over 23,500 students, LSBU is one of the largest universities in London with students drawn from across the globe, throughout the UK and the local community. The university's main campus is situated close to many of London's major landmarks and tourist attractions on the <a>South Bank</a>. </p>
<p>Partnerships are of great importance to the University. LSBU works in <a>partnership</a> with many institutions in the UK, Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia. It currently works closely with a number of Chinese Higher Education Institutions, including <a>Beijing Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Hunan University</a>, Beijing University of Posts &amp; Telecommunications, <a>Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>, National Academy of Education Administration etc. The collaborative educational programmes both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels have been running successfully over ten years with the Chinese partners.</p>
<p>LSBU is the first and only university sponsored by the <a>Office of Chinese Language Council International</a> (Hanban) to establish a Confucius Institute for Traditional Chinese Medicine in London. Its four-year bachelor-integrated master's course on <a>Traditional Chinese Medicine</a> &#x2013; <a>Acupuncture</a> had its first cohort of students in October 2008.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>A third of the university's UK students are from the <a>London Borough of Southwark</a>, a third from the rest of <a>Greater London</a> and the remaining third from the rest of the UK.  The university serves over 3,000 <a>EU</a> and other international students, from more than 120 different countries. 56% of the student population are from <a>ethnic minorities</a> and a large proportion of the students are classified as <a>mature</a> (21 or over when they start their course).</p>
<h2>Degree days</h2>
<p>The University uses the local <a>St George's Cathedral</a> for its <a>graduation</a> ceremonies, with receptions afterwards in the grounds of the <a>Imperial War Museum</a>. <a>Ede and Ravenscroft</a> acts as the supplier for the ceremonial dresses and photographer. <a>Southwark Cathedral</a> is used for <a>honorary degree</a> day ceremonies, often with a reception at the <a>Glaziers Hall</a> next to <a>London Bridge</a>.</p>
<h2>Rankings and reputation</h2>
<p>A survey published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in 2010 showed London South Bank to have the highest rate of graduate unemployment. On the other hand, London South Bank University has ranked 6th in the UK for graduate starting salaries, ahead of many universities of <a>Russell Group</a>, such as <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>University of Warwick</a>, <a>University of Bristol</a>, and <a>University of Edinburgh&#x200e;</a>. The Sunday Times' league table, measuring a number of different factors including teaching quality, research quality and employment rates, ranks the University 115th out of 122. After being placed bottom in the Independent's 2008 guide, the University said that league tables did not demonstrate the value which thousands of graduates had gained from their study there  </p>
