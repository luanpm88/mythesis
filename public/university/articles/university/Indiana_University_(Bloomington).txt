<p></p>
<p><strong>Indiana University</strong> is the flagship campus of the <a>Indiana University system</a>. It is also referred to  as <strong>Indiana,</strong> or simply <strong>IU,</strong> and is located in <a>Bloomington, Indiana</a>, <a>United States</a>. The name <strong>Indiana University Bloomington</strong> is not an official campus name, and is only used for clarity.</p>
<p>Indiana University is among the top 100 universities in the world. In 2010, the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> gave Indiana University a world rank of 90 and a national rank of 50. <a><em>Time</em></a> named Indiana University its &quot;2001 College of the Year&quot; among major research universities. Indiana is one of 60 members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, the leading American research universities. Additionally, IU has over 110 academic programs ranked in the top twenty nationwide.</p>
<p>The tenth annual <em>Newsweek-Kaplan College Guide</em>, which appeared in the August 22, 2005 issue of <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> magazine, chose IU as its &quot;Hottest Big State School&quot; and extolled the campus's blend of tradition with emerging technologies. </p>
<p>In January 2011 <a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a> ranked Bloomington the 30th out of the &quot;Best Values in Public Colleges 2011&quot;. </p>
<p><em><a>USA Today</a></em> called Bloomington one of the top 10 student-friendly college towns with a population of less than 1 million.  The university offers the latest in technology: IU was ranked as one of the top five wired universities in America according to Princeton Review and <a>PC Magazine</a>. in 2007. On the 2010 Green Report Card, issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B-.  </p>
<p>Of students enrolled in the Fall 2010 term, 1,851 were African-Americans, 1,718 were Asian, 1,416 were Hispanic, and 97 were American Indian. Fewer women (21,095) were enrolled than men (21,369). While 68% of the student body was from Indiana, students from 49 of the 50 states, Washington D.C., and 165 foreign nations were also enrolled. The 1816 Indiana state constitution required that the <a>General Assembly</a> (Indiana's <a>state legislature</a>) create a &quot;general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.&quot; It took some time for the legislature to fulfill its promise, partly due to a debate regarding whether the Indiana Territory's <a>public university</a>&#x2014;what is now <a>Vincennes University</a>&#x2014;should be adopted as the State of Indiana's public university or whether a new public university should be founded in Bloomington to replace the territorial university. While the original state-issued legislative charter for IUB was granted in 1820, construction began in 1822; the first professor was hired in 1823; classes were offered in 1824. The first class graduated in 1830. Throughout this period and until the rechartering of Vincennes University from a four-year institution to a two-year institution in 1889, a legal-cum-political battle was fought between the territorial-chartered public university in Vincennes and the State of Indiana on behalf of the state-chartered public university in Bloomington, including the legal case (<a>Trustees for Vincennes University v Indiana</a>, 1853) which was appealed to the <a>Supreme Court of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>IU developed rapidly in its first years. The hiring of <a>Andrew Wylie</a>, its first president, in 1829 signified the school's growing professionalism. The General Assembly changed the school's name to &quot;Indiana College&quot; in the same year. In 1838 the legislature changed the school's name for a final time to Indiana University.</p>
<p>Wylie's death in 1851 marks the end of the university's first period of development. IU now had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. Despite the university's more obviously secular purpose, presidents and professors were still expected to set a moral example for their charges. It was only in 1885 that a non-clergyman, biologist <a>David Starr Jordan</a>, became president.</p>
<p>Between Wylie and Jordan's administrations, the University grew slowly. Few changes rocked the university's repose. One development is interesting to modern scholars: the college admitted its first woman student, <a>Sarah Parke Morrison</a> in 1867, making IU the one of the first state universities to admit women on an equal basis with men. Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873.</p>
<h3>In mid-passage</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Sample Gates, marking the entrance to the Old Crescent, the site of IU's historic campus buildings built between 1884 and 1908</a></p>
<p>In 1883, IU awarded its first <a>Ph.D</a>. and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball) prefiguring the school's future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was far more important to the university: the university's original campus in Seminary Square near the center of Bloomington burned to the ground. Instead of rebuilding in Seminary Square, as had been the practice following previous blazes, the college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, Bloomington has expanded eastward, and the &quot;new&quot; campus is once again at the center of the city.)</p>
<p>The first extension office of IU was opened in <a>Indianapolis</a> in 1916. In 1920/1921 the <a>School of Music</a> and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the <a>Kelley School of Business</a>) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in <a>Kokomo</a> and <a>Fort Wayne</a>. The controversial <a>Kinsey Institute</a> for sexual research was established in 1945.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>IUB's 1,933 acres (7.8&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university's reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. The campus rests on a bed of <a>Indiana limestone</a>, specifically <a>Salem limestone</a> and <a>Harrodsburg limestone</a>, with outcroppings of <a>St. Louis limestone</a>. The &quot;Jordan River&quot; is a stream flowing through the center of campus. It is named for <a>David Starr Jordan</a>, <a>Darwinist</a>, <a>ichthyologist</a>, and president of IU and later <a>Stanford University</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:StudentBuilding IUBloomington.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Indiana University Student Building (right) is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]</p>
<h3>Facilities and architecture</h3>
<p>Many of the campus's buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from <a>Indiana limestone</a> quarried locally. The <a>Works Progress Administration</a> built much of the campus's core during the Great Depression. Many of the campus's buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s, when first soldiers attending under the <a>GI Bill</a> and then the <a>baby boom</a> swelled the university's enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970.</p>
<p>The <a>Bryan House</a> is the traditional on-campus home of the university president. In the 17,000-seat <a>Assembly Hall</a> (home to the IU <a>NCAA</a> basketball team), there are five <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a> banners on display. (For more on athletic facilities, see <a>Indiana Hoosiers</a>.)</p>
<p>The 1979 movie <em><a>Breaking Away</a></em> was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual Little 500 bicycle race.</p>
<p>The IU campus also has trails that many use for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly .</p>
<h3>Indiana Memorial Union</h3>
<p>The  <a>Indiana Memorial Union</a> (IMU), the second largest student union in the United States, is the campus centerpiece &#x2014; a place where students go to study, relax, eat, sleep, bowl, play pool, watch movies, play games in the arcade, and even shop. In addition to numerous stores and restaurants, it features an eight-story student activities tower (home to the <a>Indiana University Student Association</a>, Indiana Memorial Union Board, and a variety of other student organizations), a 186-room hotel, a 400-seat theatre, a  Alumni Hall,  of meeting space, and a Starbucks. Nearly 20,000 people go through the Union on a typical school day. The IMU houses an outstanding collection of Indiana art including artists from Brown County, the <a>Hoosier Group</a>, <a>Richmond Group</a> and others.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The Indiana University Bloomington Library System supports nineteen library facilities and three special research collections.  On January 26, 2010, the Indiana University Bloomington Libraries were recognized as the top American research library system in 2009 by the <a>Association of College and Research Libraries</a>.</p>
<h4>Herman B Wells Library</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|Herman B Wells Library</a>  IU's <a>Herman B Wells</a> Library is the 13th largest university library in North America. Prior to a ceremony in June 2005 when it was renamed for IU's former president and chancellor, this building was simply called the Main Library. Built in 1969, the building contains eleven floors in the graduate tower and five floors in the undergraduate tower. The building also contains the Information Commons, a fully-integrated technology center for learning and collaboration which attracts 82 percent of all undergraduate students. </p>
<p>An oft-repeated <a>urban legend</a> holds that the library sinks over an inch every year because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. A webpage hosted on the indiana.edu domain debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94&nbsp;ft (28.6 m) thick <a>limestone</a> bedrock.</p>
<h4>Branch Libraries</h4>
<p>In addition to IU's main library, the Bloomington Libraries support eighteen additional facilities:</p>

<h5>The Lilly Library</h5>
<p> The Lilly Library is one of the largest rare book and manuscript libraries in the United States. Founded in 1960 with the collection of <a>Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.</a>, of <a>Eli Lilly and Company</a> in <a>Indianapolis</a>, the library now contains approximately 400,000 rare books, 6.5 million manuscripts, and 100,000 pieces of sheet music.  The library's holdings are particularly strong in British and American history and literature, Latin Americana, medicine and science, food and drink, children's literature, fine printing and binding, popular music, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, and early printing. Notable items in the library's collections include the New Testament of the Gutenberg Bible, the first printed collection of Shakespeare's works, <a>Audubon's</a> <a>Birds of America</a>, one of 25 extant copies of the &quot;First Printing of the Declaration of Independence&quot; (also known as the &quot;Dunlap Broadside&quot;) that was printed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, George Washington's letter accepting the presidency of the United States, Abraham Lincoln's desk from his law office, a leaf from the famous Abraham Lincoln &quot;Sum Book&quot; ca. 1824-1826, <a>Lord Chesterfield's</a> letters to his son, the manuscripts of Robert Burns's &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, J. M. Synge's <em>The Playboy of the Western World</em>, and J. M. Barrie's <em>Peter Pan</em>, and typescripts of many of <a>Ian Fleming</a>'s James Bond novels. The library also owns the papers of Hollywood directors <a>Orson Welles</a> and <a>John Ford</a>, the poets <a>Sylvia Plath</a> and <a>Ezra Pound</a>, and authors <a>Edith Wharton</a> and <a>Upton Sinclair</a>. In 2006, the library received a collection of 30,000 mechanical puzzles from <a>Jerry Slocum</a>. The collection will be on permanent display. Special permission is not required to use the collections, and the library has several exhibition galleries which are open to the public.</p>
<h5>The Fine Arts Library</h5>
<p>The Fine Arts Library houses Indiana University's books and journals in the fields of the visual arts, art history, architecture, design and related disciplines and supports the academic needs of the Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Arts, and the Indiana University Department of Fine Arts. The collection comprises over 140,000 volumes and 322 periodicals, including collections of circulating slides and plates and a non-circulating collection of over 1200 artists' books.</p>
<p>IU's first Fine Arts Library was established in the late 1930s as part of the Departmental office on the second floor, east wing of the University Library which was then located in Franklin Hall. In 1941, two important events occurred: Henry Radford Hope became chairman of the Fine Arts Department in the Fall and the Fine Arts Center was created by remodeling Mitchell Hall Annex.  The Fine Arts Library moved into its current quarters inside the IU Art Museum designed by I.M. Pei in August, 1981.</p>
<h4>Special Research Collections</h4>
<p>Special research collections supported by the IU Bloomington Libraries include the Archives of Traditional Music, the Archives of African American Music &amp; Culture, and The Black Film Center Archive.</p>
<h3>IU Art Museum</h3>
<p>The IU Art Museum was first established in 1941 with a later building being designed by the world-renowned architecture firm <a>I.M. Pei</a> and Partners. In its unique design, it has no right angles in its construction. Completed in 1982, the museum collection of over 30,000 objects includes works by <a>Claude Monet</a> and <a>Jackson Pollock</a>. The museum has particular strengths in the art of Africa, Oceania, the Americas, Ancient Greece and Rome, and Early Modernism, and its collections of works on paper (prints, drawings and photographs). The IU Art Museum is also ranked as one of the top five university art museums along with <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, and <a>Yale</a>.</p>
<p>Notable artists who have their work displayed there include <a>Marcel Duchamp</a>, <a>Pablo Picasso</a> and <a>Henri Matisse</a>.</p>

<h3>Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center</h3>
<p>Founded in 2002, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center is named after Marcellus Neal and Frances Marshall, early African American graduates from Indiana University. In addition to the culture center, it is also the home to the African American Cultural Center Library, the African American Arts Institute and the Office of Diversity Education.</p>
<h3>Lee Norvelle Theatre and Drama Center</h3>
<p>In January 2002, IU opened the Lee Norvelle Theatre and Drama Center on the Bloomington campus, adjacent to the old Theatre Building. The Ruth N. Halls Theatre is a 443-seat proscenium space and is the venue for four season productions each academic year in addition to a University faculty dance concert. The Wells-Metz Theatre is a 236 seat venue which is home to 4 season productions each academic year. An intimate space with audience as close as  from the action, the Wells-Metz has been the location of musicals and large Shakespearean productions, as well as small cast shows. With a full stage trap room and overhead suspension grid, the theatre has become known for its environmental productions with performers playing throughout the space from trap to grid.</p>
<h3>Multidisciplinary Science Buildings</h3>
<p>On October 16, 2007, Simon Hall (MSB I), IU's first new science structure completed in 50 years, was dedicated by <a>Eli Lilly</a>'s CEO Sidney Taurel. The $55.7 million  structure is part of Indiana University's life science initiative. The building will house cell biologists, microbiologists, molecular biologists, geneticists, analytical chemists and biochemists, and biophysicists. Designed by <a>Flad Architects</a>, the building received High Honors from <em>R&amp;D Magazine&#x2019;s</em> 2008 Lab of the Year competition. </p>
<p>Multidisciplinary Science Building II, also designed by <a>Flad Architects</a>, officially opened in October 2009 and aims to expand and deepen IU's research operations. The $45.9 million  structure is located near the Fee Lane Parking Garage and features many environmentally friendly design elements.</p>
<p>The third Multidisciplinary Science Building is currently being planned. MSB III will be quite similar to the first two.</p>
<h3>Athletic Complex</h3>
<p>Indiana University's athletic facilities are located on campus and are grouped in between East 17th Street, Dunn Street and the <a>IN-45</a>/<a>IN-46</a> bypass. <a>Assembly Hall</a>, <a>Cook Hall</a>, <a>Memorial Stadium</a>, <a>Mellencamp Pavillion</a>, the <a>Gladstein Fieldhouse</a>, the <a>IU Tennis Center</a>, the <a>Billy Hayes Track</a> and <a>Bill Armstrong Stadium</a> are all located within the complex.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Rankings and recognition</h3>
<p> IU has over 120 majors and programs ranked in the nation's top 20. Twenty-nine graduate programs and four schools at Indiana University are ranked among the top 25 in the country in the <em><a>US News &amp; World Report</a><strong>s Best Graduate Schools 2001&#x2013;02. </strong></em>Time<em> magazine named IU its 2001 College of the Year among major research universities. </em>Newsweek<em> named it the Hottest Big State School in the Nation in 2005. The Institute of Higher Education at Shanghai Jiao Tong University ranked Indiana University as the 28th best in the world in the social sciences and the 90th best in the world overall. Also the <a>Russia</a>n based </em><a>Global University Ranking</a><em> placed Indiana University among top 90 in the world in 2009. Acceptance rate for the University is 60%. Average SAT's range from 1010-1180.</em></p>
<p>Upon assuming leadership of Indiana University, one of President <a>Adam Herbert</a>'s biggest initiatives focused on &quot;mission differentiation&quot; for IU's eight campuses, which includes making the flagship Bloomington campus choosier among freshman applicants. Under the proposal, IUB would educate the professionals, executives and researchers while the regional campuses would educate the state's remaining labor force. Advocates believe it will rejuvenate Indiana's economy while critics argue it betrays the university's mission of educating more of Indiana's populace. The university's academic system is divided into one large &quot;College&quot; (which itself contains one school) and twelve other schools and divisions. Together, these thirteen units offer more than 900 individual degree programs and majors.</p>
<h3>Schools and colleges</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>College of Arts and Sciences</h4>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences, known as the College, is the largest of the University's academic divisions, and is home to more than 40 percent of IU's undergraduates. In addition, the College offers many electives and general education courses for students enrolled in most other schools on campus. There are more than 50 academic departments in the College, encompassing a broad range of disciplines from the traditional (such as biology, chemistry, biochemistry, English, economics, mathematics, and physics) to more modern and specialized areas, including Jewish Studies, <a>History and Philosophy of Science</a>, and International Studies. Through the College, IU also offers instruction in over 40 foreign languages, one of the largest language study offerings at any American university. IU is the only university in the nation that offers a degree in Hungarian (although it was done through the Individualized Major Program) and is the first university in the United States to offer a doctorate in <a>Gender Studies</a>.  Indiana University is also home to the nation's only degree-granting <a>Department of Central Eurasian Studies</a>.  The university's catalog at one time boasted that a student could study any language from Albanian to Uzbek. The College is the parent division for fifteen individual research institutes, and holds the distinction of being the only academic division within the university to house an autonomous school (The Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Arts) within it. A number of first- and second-year students from the <a>Indiana University School of Medicine</a> (which is based at <a>IUPUI</a>) complete their preclinical education at the Bloomington campus's Medical Science Program, which is housed within the Department of <a>Biology</a> and the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute. The College is also home to the Department of <a>Folklore</a> and <a>Ethnomusicology</a>, the first formally established academic department in folklore at any United States university, and the only such department to integrate these two practices into one field. IU also features a world-class <a>cyclotron</a>, the <a>Indiana University Cyclotron Facility</a>, operated by the Department of Physics. The College also houses IU's Department of Theatre and Drama which offers a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre, a Master of Fine Arts in Acting, Directing, Playwriting or Design/Technology, and as of the 2007-2008 school year, a BFA in Musical Theatre.  In 2009, professor of political science Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences since its inception in 1969.</p>
<h4>Maurer School of Law</h4>
<p> The Maurer School of Law, founded in 1842, is one of the oldest schools on the Bloomington campus. It features a law library recently ranked first in the nation and is situated on the southwest corner of campus. In 2000, then-Chief Justice <a>William Rehnquist</a> presided over a mock trial of King Henry VIII in the school's <a>moot courtroom</a>. In the 2009 <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> rankings, the school was ranked 23rd in the nation among law schools and tied for 7th in public law schools. Notable alumni from the School of Law include songwriter <a>Hoagy Carmichael</a>, Supreme Court Justice <a>Sherman Minton</a>, and Vice-Chairman of the 9/11 Commission and former congressman <a>Lee Hamilton</a>. On December 4, 2008, the school of law was renamed the Michael Maurer School of Law.</p>
<h4>School of Library and Information Science</h4>
<p>The IU School of Library and Information Science was recently ranked by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> as the 7th best program of its type in the nation.  It has also been ranked number 1 in scholarly productivity by a 2006 study published in the journal Library &amp; Information Science Research.</p>
<h4>Jacobs School of Music</h4>
<p> Founded in the beginning of the 20th century by Charles Campbell, the Jacobs School of Music focuses on voice, opera, orchestral conducting, and jazz studies. It has been ranked #1 in the country tied with <a>Juilliard</a> and <a>Eastman School of Music</a> by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.  With more than 1,600 students, the school is the largest of its kind in the US and among the largest in the world. The school's facilities, including five buildings located in the heart of campus, comprise recital halls, more than 170 practice rooms, choral and instrumental rehearsal rooms, and more than 100 offices and studios. Its prestigious faculty has included such notable names as <a>J&#x00e1;nos Starker</a>, Costanz Cuccaro, <a>Timothy Noble</a> <a>Andr&#x00e9; Watts</a>, <a>Menahem Pressler</a>, <a>Linda Strommen</a>, Abbey Simon, Ray Cramer, <a>David Baker</a>, Earl Bates, <a>Carol Vaness</a>, <a>Sylvia McNair</a>, violinist <a>Joshua Bell</a>, conductor <a>Leonard Slatkin</a>, and composer <a>Sven-David Sandstr&#x00f6;m</a>. Notable alumni include <a>Edgar Meyer</a> and <a>soprano</a> <a>Angela Brown</a>.</p>
<h4>Kelley School of Business</h4>
<p> &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|William J. Godfrey Graduate and Executive Center</a> --&gt; The Kelley School of Business was founded in 1920 as the University's School of Commerce and Finance. Approximately 6,100 students are enrolled in undergraduate, graduate Accountancy and Information Systems degrees, <a>MBA</a> and <a>PhD</a> programs, and online degree program Kelley Direct.</p>
<p>Kelley is one of the top business schools in the United States. It is one of only three business schools in the nation for whom all undergraduate and graduate programs rank in the top 20 of the <em><a>US News &amp; World Report</a></em> college rankings. In 2010, <em>US News</em> ranked the undergraduate program 10th in the nation (6th among public schools) and, in 2010, the MBA program 23rd in the nation (7th among public schools). In 2007, the <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> ranked Kelley's MBA program fifth in the nation among regional programs. Kelley's programs in consumer products, and energy and industrial products and services were second, marketing was third and accounting, eighth. <em><a>Business Week</a></em> ranked the undergraduate program 16th in 2008 (6th among public schools) and the graduate program 15th in the nation in 2008 and fourth among public schools. In addition, <em>Business Week</em> gave the undergraduate program an A in teaching and an A+ career services.</p>
<h4>Division of Labor Studies</h4>
<p>The Division of Labor Studies, formerly a unit housed within the School of Continuing Studies, was founded in the 1940s during the tenure of Herman B Wells in response to the growing role of organized labor in American society. Today, the Division is one of only several degree-granting programs in the nation for the area of labor studies or industrial relations. Over the past year, the Division has come under increased pressure to move to a larger academic unit, such as the College of Arts and Sciences.  Notable faculty in recent years have included Leonard Page, General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton Administration, and labor economist/author <a>Michael Yates</a>.</p>
<h4>School of Education</h4>
<p> The School of Education, formerly a part of the College of Arts and Science, has been independent since 1923. One of the largest schools of education in the United States, and consistently placed among the top 20 graduate schools of education in the United States by <em><a>U.S. News</a></em>, it offers a range of degrees in professional education: a B.S. in teacher education leading to a teaching license, M.S., education specialist (Ed. S.) and doctoral (Ed. D, Ph.D.) degrees.</p>
<h4>School of Public and Environmental Affairs</h4>
<p> The School of Public and Environmental Affairs (or SPEA) is the largest school of its kind in the United States. Through the wide array of concentrations and joint degrees SPEA offers, students can design an education corresponding to their interests. Founded in 1972, SPEA is known for its distinctive interdisciplinary approach. It brings together the social, natural, behavioral, and administrative sciences in one faculty.</p>
<p>In the most recent &quot;Best Graduate Schools&quot; (2009) survey by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, SPEA ranked second and is the nation's highest-ranked undergraduate and graduate program in public affairs at a public institution. SPEA was ranked just behind Syracuse University and tied with Harvard. Six of its specialty programs are ranked in the top 10 listings; four others are in the top 20. While similar rankings do not yet exist for graduate schools of environmental science, SPEA's reputation in the field is growing. SPEA is also a founding member of the Council of Environmental Science Deans and Directors.</p>
<p>SPEA is the only institution in its league with an interdisciplinary character where students can combine <a>environmental science</a> and <a>public affairs</a>. Indiana University's other highly-ranked schools and programs complement SPEA's offerings; the school has 15 joint programs in social and natural sciences and professional fields. For example, in conjunction with the Department of Political Science, SPEA offers a Joint Ph.D. Program in <a>Public Policy</a>, the only one of its kind in the country. In addition, it offers many joint Masters degrees, such as MPA/MSES; MPA/JD; and MSES/JD programs.</p>
<h4>School of Journalism</h4>
<p>Housed in a building named for famed war correspondent and alumnus Ernie Pyle, the School of Journalism will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2011. The school offers undergraduate and graduate programs for those preparing for careers as reporters, editors, broadcasters, public relations professionals, multimedia specialists, and educators. The School of Journalism draws students from as far away as China and Ukraine and as close as Bloomington or other Indiana towns.</p>
<p>Among the alumni are more than 30 Pulitzer Prize winners. Alumni work in every field of journalism, from the oldest form of print publishing to newest form as online journalists. Many remain active in supporting the school by mentoring students, facilitating internship programs, and donating time and financial gifts to the school.</p>
<h4>School of Informatics and Computing</h4>
<p>In 1999, the Indiana University School of <a>Informatics</a> was established as an environment for research professors and students to develop new uses for information technology in order to solve specific problems in areas as diverse as biology, fine arts, and economics. Informatics is also interested in &quot;how people transform technology, and how technology transforms us.&quot;</p>
<p>The School is one of a handful which offer degrees in <a>Human-Computer Interaction</a>. The School is the only one in the country to offer a formal degree which combines <a>Human-Computer Interaction</a> and <a>Computer Security</a>.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>[[File:Basketball.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kent Benson]] scoring for Indiana in a <a>Big Ten</a> game against <a>Illinois</a> in 1977]] IU's intercollegiate athletics program has a long tradition in several key sports. From its beginnings with baseball in 1867, the Hoosier athletic program has grown to include over 600 male and female student-athletes on 24 varsity teams boasting one of the nation's best overall records. Sports sponsored by the university include <a>football</a>, men's <a>basketball</a>, women's <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a> and <a>track</a>, <a>baseball</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>rowing</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>swimming</a> &amp; <a>diving</a> and more.</p>
<p>The Hoosiers became a member of the prestigious <a>Big Ten Conference</a> on December 1, 1899. The school's national affiliation is with the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). National team titles (now totaling 25; 24 NCAA, 1 <a>AIAW</a>) have been won in nine men's sports and one women's sport (tennis), topped by a record-setting six straight men's swimming &amp; diving titles, seven men's <a>soccer</a> crowns and five titles in men's <a>basketball</a>. Indiana student-athletes have won 133 NCAA individual titles, including 79 in men's swimming and diving and 31 in men's <a>track and field</a>. In addition, IU teams have won or shared 157 <a>Big Ten Conference</a> championships.</p>
<p>The IU athletics endowment is $32 million, the largest in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>. The Varsity Club, which is the fundraising arm of the Athletics Department, drew a record $11.5 million in gifts and pledges in the fiscal year 2004&#x2013;05. In addition, overall annual giving has increased 8.3% in the last year and 44.8 percent in the last three years.</p>
<p>In addition to its rich tradition in intervarsity sports, IU also boasts a strong reputation in many non-varsity sports. Many of these &quot;club&quot; teams, especially those in <a>ice hockey</a> and <a>rugby union</a>, have achieved a great deal of success in intercollegiate competition. The consistent success of these athletic clubs has several times led the university to establish varsity programs in sports in which there had previously not been a team for NCAA intervarsity competition. </p>
<p>A large percentage of the IU student body regularly participates in both formal and/or informal intramural sports, including <a>football</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>basketball</a>, and <a>golf</a>. Among intramural athletics, IU's reputation for student participation and instruction in the <a>martial arts</a> is particularly strong.</p>
