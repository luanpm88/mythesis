<p><strong>Florida International University</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>FIU</strong>) is an <a>American</a> <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Miami</a>, <a>Florida</a>, in the <a>United States</a>, with its main campus at <a>University Park</a>. Florida International University is classified as a top-tier Research University with high research activity by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a>, and is a first-tier research university as designated by the <a>Florida Legislature</a>. Founded in 1965, FIU is the youngest university to be awarded a <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> chapter by the <a>Phi Beta Kappa Society</a>, the country's oldest academic <a>honor society</a>.</p>
<p>FIU offers 191 programs of study with more than 280 <a>majors</a> in 26 colleges and schools. FIU offers many graduate programs, including <a>architecture</a>, <a>business administration</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>law</a>, and <a>medicine</a>, offering 82 <a>master's degrees</a>, 30 <a>doctoral degrees</a>, and 2 <a>professional degree</a>s. FIU is one of Florida's primary graduate research universities, and awards over 2,000 graduate and professional degrees annually.</p>
<p>FIU is the <a>15th-largest university in the United States</a>, the 4th-largest university in Florida, and the largest in <a>South Florida</a>. For Fall 2010, total enrollment was 42,287 students, including 9,320 <a>graduate student</a>s, and 2,974 full-time faculty with over 161,000 <a>alumni</a> around the world. In 2007, FIU's research expenditure was $89.1&nbsp;million, with an endowment of $138&nbsp;million.</p>
<p>Since 2007, more <a>valedictorian</a>s from <a>South Florida</a> choose to attend FIU than any other university in the country. Admission selectivity has continued to increase with freshmen acceptance rates dropping from 43% in 2006 to 34% in 2009. <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> (2010) ranks FIU as the <a>most selective university in Florida</a> since 2007, and the most selective public university in Florida since the early-2000s. As Miami's public research university, competition to enroll at FIU has continued to increase as more students apply each year. For Fall 2009, the average incoming freshmen had an average <a>SAT</a> score of 1726, a 26 <a>ACT</a> score and a 3.74 high school <a>GPA</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding: 1943&#x2013;1969</h3>
<p>[[File:IHRC FIU.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Meteorologists at work at the [[National Hurricane Center]] in 1970. Previously located in <a>Coral Gables</a>, the NHC moved to FIU in 1995.]]The story of Florida International University's founding began in 1943, when state Senator <a>Ernest 'Cap' Graham</a> (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator <a>Bob Graham</a>) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.</p>
<p>In 1964, Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield. It instructed the state Board of Education and the <a>Board of Regents</a> (BOR), to begin planning for the development of a state university in Miami. The bill was signed into law by then-governor <a>W. Haydon Burns</a> in June 1965, marking FIU's official founding.</p>
<p>FIU's founding president <a>Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Perry</a> was appointed by the Board of Regents in July 1969 after a nationwide search. At 32 years old, the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and, at the time, the youngest <a>university president</a> in the country. Perry recruited three co-founders - Butler Waugh, Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo - who came to the abandoned Tamiami Airport in the summer of 1969 and launched the monumental task of creating a new university. <a>Alvah Chapman, Jr.</a>, former <em><a>Miami Herald</a></em> publisher and <a>Knight Ridder</a> chairman, used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort. In the 1980s, Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees.]]</p>
<p>In September 1972, 5,667 students finally entered the new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Previously, Miami had been the largest city in the country lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now <a>Miami-Dade College</a>). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the <a>University of Miami</a> and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.</p>
<p><a>Gregory Baker Wolfe</a>, a former United States diplomat and then-president of <a>Portland State University</a> became FIU's third president, from 1979 to 1986. After stepping down as president, Wolfe taught in the university's <a>International Relations</a> department. The <a>student union</a> on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor. FIU's student enrollment of 42,287 (Fall 2010) makes FIU one of the <a>15th-largest university in the United States</a>.</p>
<p><a>225px|left|thumb|The Wertheim Conservatory houses many rare species of plants and foliage.</a></p>
<p>Having begun as a two-year upper division university serving the Miami area, FIU has grown into a traditional university serving students from all over the world. To strengthen this growth, more than $600&nbsp;million have been invested in construction, with the addition of new residence halls, the on-campus <a>FIU Stadium</a>, recreation center, student center, and Greek Life mansions, as well as the fielding of the Division I-A <a>Golden Panthers football</a> team in 2002. FIU has also increased its academic prestige with the founding of the <a>FIU School of Architecture</a>, <a>FIU College of Law</a> and the <a>FIU College of Medicine</a>, as well as the acquisition of the historical <a>Wolfsonian-FIU Museum</a> in <a>Miami Beach</a>.</p>
<p>Florida International University also emphasizes research as a major component of its mission and sponsored research funding (grants and contracts) from external sources for the year 2007-2008 totaled $110&nbsp;million. FIU has a budget of over $649&nbsp;million</p>
<p>On November 14, 2008, Maidique announced that he would be stepping down and asked FIU's Board of Trustees to begin the search of a new president. He said he would remain president until a new one was found.  On April 25, 2009, <a>Mark B. Rosenberg</a> was selected to become FIU's fifth president. Rosenberg's tenure began on August 3, 2009, and signed a five-year contract with the Board of Trustees. On June 12, 2009, the <a>FIU College of Medicine</a> received the largest donation in the university's history. <a>Herbert Wertheim</a> donated $20&nbsp;million to the College of Medicine, to be matched by state funds to create a total donation to the College of Medicine of $40&nbsp;million. As such, the College of Medicine changed its name to the &quot;Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine&quot;.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Florida International University has two major campuses in Miami, the main campus, <a>University Park</a> and its regional campus, the <a>Biscayne Bay Campus</a>, as well as several branch campuses and research facilities throughout <a>South Florida</a>, in <a>Tianjin, China</a>, and in <a>Nervi</a> and <a>Genoa, Italy</a>. encompasses 344&nbsp;acres (1.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) in the Miami neighborhood of <a>University Park</a>, (from which the area derives its name).</p>
<p>University Park houses almost all of the university's colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities. University Park is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential House, the home of FIU's president, the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the <a>Frost Art Museum</a>, the International Hurricane Research Center, and the university's athletic facilities such as <a>FIU Stadium</a>, <a>U.S. Century Bank Arena</a>, and the <a>University Park Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>Located five blocks north of University Park, is the 38-acre (145,000&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) <a>Engineering Center</a> which houses a part of the <a>College of Engineering and Computing</a> and is the home of FIU's <a>Motorola</a> <a>Nanofabrication</a> Research Facility. The Engineering Center is serviced by the CATS Shuttle, FIU's student buses, which run throughout the day on weekdays connecting the two parts of campus.</p>
<h4>University Park history</h4>
<p>Construction on the campus began in 1965 with the complete destruction of <a>Tamiami Airport</a> in 1969. At the time, very little was located around FIU, and the campus was referred to as University Park. As Miami grew west, the area came to be known as University Park after the university's campus name.</p>
<p>Until the early-1990s, aerial pictures of the campus clearly revealed the features of the airport that used to occupy the land until 1969. <a>Construction</a> has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past. University Park is a lush, heavily-vegetated campus, with many lakes and nature preserves, as well as an arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.</p>
<p>On June 12, 2009, FIU's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus. However, the change created a large backlash from the FIU community, as many felt it unfitting to name the campus after him. A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change, and to keep the name University Park. A <a>Facebook</a> group, &quot;No to Maidique's Campus&quot; with over 2,000 supporters has made national news, in many newspapers, TV news stations, and collegiate magazines, supporting to keep the name &quot;University Park&quot;.</p>

<h3>Biscayne Bay Campus</h3>
<p>[[File:BBCCampus.jpg|thumb|right|225px|FIU's regional campus in [[North Miami]], the <a>Biscayne Bay Campus</a>, opened in 1977.]] The <a>Biscayne Bay Campus</a> in <a>North Miami</a> is FIU's second-largest campus. It was opened in 1977 by <a>Harold Crosby</a> and occupies about 200&nbsp;acres (809,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;), directly on the bay and adjacent to the <a>Oleta River State Park</a>, with which FIU has a research partnership. Access to these resources inspired the creation of a <a>marine biology</a> program on the Biscayne Bay Campus, which has become one of the university's most recognized programs. The Biscayne Bay Campus also houses the <a>School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management</a>, one of the nation's top programs, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Aquatic Center, and the Kovens Conference Center. The Golden Panther Express, FIU's student buses, connect the main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus throughout the day on weekdays.</p>
<h3>Regional campuses</h3>
<p>FIU also has other smaller regional campuses located throughout South Florida in both <a>Miami-Dade County</a> and <a>Broward County</a>, serving the local communities in research, continuing studies, and in culture. In Broward County, there is the FIU Pines Center in <a>Pembroke Pines</a>, opened to satisfy the demand from Broward County residents. This center serves mostly night students in programs within the <a>College of Business Administration</a>. In <a>Miami-Dade County</a>, there are four regional FIU facilities, the Metropolitan Center in <a>Downtown Miami</a> (<a>Flagler Street</a> and <a>Miami Avenue</a>), a part of the Chapman Graduate School of Business, the <a>Wolfsonian-FIU Museum</a> in <a>Miami Beach</a> (<a>Washington Avenue</a> and 10th St), the <a>FIU-Florida Memorial</a> research center in <a>Miami Gardens</a>, and a research site in <a>Homestead</a>.</p>
<h3>International campuses</h3>
<p>[[File:Tuc.jpg|225px|right|thumb|[[Florida International University Tianjin Center|FIU Tianjin Center]] in <a>Tianjin, China</a>.]] FIU also has international campuses in Asia and Europe. The <a>Wolfsonian-FIU Museum</a> has a regional facility in <a>Nervi</a>, Italy, the <a>School of Architecture</a> has facilities in <a>Genoa, Italy</a> for FIU's upper-division and graduate Architecture students, and the <a>Florida International University Tianjin Center</a> in China, from which a branch of the <a>School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management</a> operates. The Tianjin Center was constructed as a cooperative venture with the local municipal government and was opened in the Summer of 2006.</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|University Park Towers, graduate student and upperclassmen apartments.</a> Florida International University's student housing facilities are managed by the Office of Housing and Residential Life and are available on both the <a>main campus</a> and the <a>Biscayne Bay Campus</a>. Currently, there are 3,300 beds distributed throughout 10 apartment buildings and 6 residence halls. At University Park, these are the University Park Apartments, Panther Hall, the University Park Towers, Everglades Hall, Lakeview Hall North, and Lakeview Hall South. At the Biscayne Bay Campus, housing is available in Bay Vista Hall. Together, approximately 14% of FIU's student population lives on-campus in student housing.</p>
<p>The Office of Housing and Residential Life also offers optional communities in the residence halls. These communities include the Architecture and Arts Community, for students majoring in Architecture or art-related majors, Honors Place for Honors College students, F.Y.R.S.T. (First Year Residents Succeeding Together) for all freshmen in any major, F.Y.R.S.T. Explore, for undecided freshmen, Leader's in Residence for students interested in civic service and leadership opportunities and the Law Community for College of Law students.</p>
<p>Plans were underway for land acquisition of the Miami Fairgrounds for a housing/entertainment mini-city, with 4 to 5 housing towers, a shopping center, and two new parking garages in between FIU Stadium and the Wertheim Performing Arts Center.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p><a>225px|right|thumb|Green Library, is one of the largest libraries in the Southeastern U.S. and is the largest building on-campus.</a> FIU has six libraries, Green Library, FIU's main library; the Glenn Hubert Library (Biscayne Bay Campus), the Wolfsonian Library, the Engineering Library, the Law Library, and the Medical Library.</p>
<h4>Green Library</h4>
<p>Green Library is FIU's main library, and is the largest building on-campus, and one of the largest libraries in the Southeastern United States. Originally built in the late 1960s, the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry &amp; Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors if expansions are necessary. This eight floor structure was built around the original three-story 1960s library, while it was still in use.</p>
<p>The first floor of the building has numerous offices, classrooms, auditorium spaces, a snack stop, and a <a>Starbucks</a>. The second floor has the reference section, cartography, circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third and fourth floors are the home of the Medical Library, as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College, special collections section, archives, and study lounges. The fifth floor is the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual sections. The sixth, seventh, and eighth floors are strictly quiet floors, and contain the general collection floors, numerous student study lounges, and library administration offices.</p>
<h4>Law and Engineering libraries</h4>
<p>Other libraries at University Park include the three-story <a>College of Law</a> Library in Diaz-Balart Hall, the Engineering Library, and the Medical Library. The Law Library opened in 2002, and has three floors, with all three holding the library's general collection. The third floor has a two-story, quiet reading room, as well as numerous study lounges. Although the Law Library is restricted to Law students, other students may use the library for research purposes. The Engineering Library is located on the second  floor of the main building of the Engineering Center.</p>
<h4>Medical Library</h4>
<p><a>The FIU Medical Library</a> opened in August 2009 at the same time as the opening of the <a>Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine</a>. The Medical Library offers a rich array of resources, services, and instructional support to advance the teaching and learning, discovery, and healthcare programs of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and is currently located on the third floor of Green Library building. Future construction of buildings for the College of Medicine will include a new space for the Medical Library outside of Green Library.</p>
<h4>Wolfsonian and Glenn Hubert libraries</h4>
<p>The Wolfsonian Library is located at the <a>Wolfsonian-FIU Museum</a> in <a>South Beach</a>, on the corner of <a>Washington Avenue</a> and 10th Street. The collection focuses exclusively on <a>architecture</a>, <a>art</a>, <a>design</a>, and <a>history</a> of the <a>Western World</a> from 1885 to 1945. The library serves mostly as a <a>research library</a> with an extensive collection of <a>primary sources</a>. For students, prior approval from the staff is needed to enter the library. The Glenn Hubert Library, previously named the 'Biscayne Bay Library', is the main, and sole library at the <a>Biscayne Bay Campus</a>. </p>
<p>Together, the entire FIU university-wide Library holdings include over 2,097,207 volumes, 52,511 current serials, 3,587,663 microform units, and 163,715 audio visual units.</p>
<h3>International Hurricane Research Center</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|225px|Everglades Hall, upperclassmen apartments.</a> The International Hurricane Research Center (IHRC) is the nation&#x2019;s only university-based research facility dedicated to mitigating the damage tropical storms inflict on people, the economy, and the environment. The IHRC is home to four institutes: the Laboratory for Coastal Research; the Laboratory for Social Science Research; the Laboratory for Insurance, Financial &amp; Economic Research; and the Laboratory for Wind Engineering Research, as well as the FIU Wall of Wind. This first-of-its-kind testing system consists of a series of large industrial fans powered by race car engines. It produces a wind field equivalent to a Category Four <a>hurricane</a>. Not to be confused with the <a>National Hurricane Center</a> (also located at University Park), the IHRC is located on the western side of the campus.</p>
<h3>Construction and expansion</h3>
<p>In the early 2000s, emphasis at FIU was placed on growth in degree programs and student enrollment. Since 2005 however, student enrollment has been capped and emphasis is now being placed on improving the quality of the existing academic programs. With the addition of the <a>College of Medicine</a>, the demand for facilities and classroom space has greatly increased. Future projects and/or buildings under construction include:</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<h4>Spirit traditions</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Green Library and Owa Ehan.</a> FIU has many traditions from student spirit groups, alumni association events and student spirit events. Panther Rage, one of FIU's largest student spirit groups are seen at all the athletics events.</p>
<p>FIU also holds many Golden Panther spirit events throughout the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp held in the Summer prior to the Fall term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a <a>retreat</a> center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants. Panther Camp is expected to grow in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.</p>
<p>Week of Welcome, usually held the first or second week of the Fall semester holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the Torch. Trail of the Torch is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a <a>pep rally</a> is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, the torch of knowledge is lit and blue and gold candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing the torch from the Housing Quad to the torch in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and <a>Homecoming</a> Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.</p>
<h4>Alma Mater</h4>

<h4>Superstitions and legends</h4>
<p>There are many other traditions at FIU that are not spirit-related. The large cube in front of Deuxi&#x00e8;me Maison is said to give good luck in exams and tests and thus is spun by hundreds of students every semester. During <a>final exams</a>, a line forms around the cube with people waiting to be able to spin the cube for good luck on their exams. The &quot;Kissing Bridge&quot; tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition is that if you kiss someone on the bridge you will stay with them forever. The top floor of Green Library is said to be haunted; students have reported a friendly ghost that wanders the halls minutes before the library closes at night. Another <a>superstition</a> is that if a student steps on the seal engraved in front of the Graham Center and in the WUC at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the university's student union, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it.</p>
