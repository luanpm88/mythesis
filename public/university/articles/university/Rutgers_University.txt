<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</strong> (usually referred to as <strong>Rutgers University</strong> or just <strong>Rutgers</strong>), is the largest institution for higher education in <a>New Jersey</a>. It was originally chartered as <em>Queen's College</em> in 1766 and is the <a>eighth-oldest college</a> in the United States. Rutgers was originally a <a>private university</a> affiliated with the <a>Dutch Reformed Church</a> and admitted only male students, but evolved into a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> <a>research university</a>. Rutgers is one of only two <a>colonial colleges</a> that later became public universities, the other being The <a>College of William and Mary</a>.</p>
<p>Rutgers was designated The State University of New Jersey by acts of the <a>New Jersey Legislature</a> in 1945 and 1956. Rutgers is the largest university within New Jersey's <a>state university</a> system.  The university offers more than 100 distinct <a>bachelor</a>, 100 <a>master</a>, and 80 <a>doctoral</a> and <a>professional degree</a> programs across 175 academic departments, 29 degree-granting schools and colleges, 16 of which offer graduate programs of study.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Shortly after the <a>College of New Jersey</a> (now Princeton University) was established in 1746, ministers of the <a>Dutch Reformed Church</a>, seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the American colonies, sought to establish a college to train those who wanted to become <a>ministers</a> within the church. Through several years of effort by Rev. <a>Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen</a> (1691&ndash;1747) and Rev. <a>Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh</a> (1736&ndash;1790), later the college's first president, <em>Queen's College</em> was chartered on 10 November 1766. The college admitted its first students in 1771&mdash;a single sophomore and a handful of first-year students taught by a lone instructor&mdash;and granted its first degree in 1774, to <a>Matthew Leydt</a>. When the Revolutionary War broke out and taverns were suspected by the British as being hotbeds of rebel activity, the college abandoned the tavern and held classes in private homes. The college's third president, the Rev. <a>Ira Condict</a>, laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the <a>New Brunswick Theological Seminary</a>, founded in 1784, relocated from <a>Brooklyn, New York</a>, to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College (and the <a>Queen's College Grammar School</a>, as all three institutions were then overseen by the <a>Reformed Church in America</a>). Shortly after, the <em>University of Newark</em> (1935) was merged with Rutgers in 1946, as were the <em>College of South Jersey</em> and <em>South Jersey Law School,</em> in 1950. These two institutions became <a>Newark</a> and <a>Camden</a>. On September 10, 1970, after much debate, the Board of Governors voted to admit women into the previously all-male <a>Rutgers College</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Newark Campus</em> (or <a>Rutgers-Newark</a>), consists of 8 undergraduate, graduate and professional schools, including: Newark College of Arts and Sciences, University College, School of Criminal Justice, Graduate School, College of Nursing, <a>School of Public Affairs and Administration</a>, <a>Rutgers Business School</a> and <a>Rutgers School of Law - Newark</a>. As of 2007, 6,503 undergraduates and 3,700 graduate students (total 10,203) are enrolled at the Newark campus.</p>
<p>A bus system, that runs 24/hrs a day, transports students from each campus. The Knight Mover is an individualized service that operates from 3am - 6:45am. The school has 14 different bus routes, as well as a shuttle that makes random stops along the college ave. campus.</p>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Winter at Old Queens, the oldest building at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, built between 1808&#x2013;1825. Old Queens currently houses much of the Rutgers University administration.</a> Governance at Rutgers University rests with a <em>Board of Trustees</em> consisting currently of 59 members and a <em>Board of Governors</em> consisting of 11 members: 6 appointed by the <a>Governor of New Jersey</a> and 5 chosen by the Board of Trustees.  The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body to the Board of Governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the property and assets of the University that existed before the institution became the State University of New Jersey in 1945. The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of Governors in 1956. Today, the Board of Governors maintains much of the corporate control of the University.</em></p>
<p>The members of the Board of Trustees are voted upon by different constituencies or appointed. &quot;Two faculty and two students are elected by the University Senate as nonvoting representatives. The 59 voting members are chosen in the following way as mandated by state law: 28 charter members (of whom at least three shall be women), 20 alumni members nominated by the Nominating Committee of the Board of Trustees, and five public members appointed by the governor of the state with confirmation by the New Jersey State Senate. The six members of the Board of Governors appointed by the governor also serve as members of the Board of Trustees. Of the 28 charter seats, three are reserved for students with full voting rights.&quot;</p>
<p>The <a>president of Rutgers University</a>, chosen by and answerable to the Trustees and Governors, sits as an <a>ex-officio</a> member of both governing boards. He, as the chief administrator of the university, is charged with its day-to-day operations. Since 2002, the president of Rutgers University has been <a>Richard Levis McCormick</a> (born 1947).</p>

<p>On September 13, 2010, the Wall Street Journal ranked Rutgers University #21 out of 25 schools whose graduates are top-rated by recruiters.</p>
<h3>Admissions and financial aid</h3>
<p><em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> considers the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus of Rutgers University to be a &quot;more selective&quot; school in terms of the rigour of its admissions processes. 56% of undergraduate applicants are accepted. In comparison, 62% of applicants to nearby <a>Pennsylvania State University</a> (for the University Park campus) and 47% of applicants to the <a>University of Delaware</a> are accepted. Average <a>SAT</a> scores of enrolling students at Rutgers range from 530&#x2013;630 on the critical reading section, 560&#x2013;670 for the mathematics section, and 530-640 for the writing section. Admitted applicants to nearby Pennsylvania State University average scores between from 530&#x2013;640 on the verbal section and 570&#x2013;680 on the math section; the University of Delaware's student body averages between 550&#x2013;640 verbal and 560&#x2013;660 math.</p>
<p>As a state university, Rutgers charges two separate rates for tuition and fees depending on whether an enrolled student is a resident of the <a>State</a> of <a>New Jersey</a> (in-state) or not (out-of-state). The <em>Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning</em> estimates that costs in-state student of attending Rutgers would amount to $18,899 for an undergraduate living on-campus and $22,395 for a graduate student. For an out-of-state student, the costs rise to $26,497 and $27,476 respectively.</p>
<h3>Libraries and museums</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Alexander Library</a> The Rutgers University library system consists of 26 libraries and centers located on the University's three campuses, housing a collection of over 10.5 million holdings, including 3,522,359 volumes, 4,517,726 microforms, 2,544,126 documents, and subscriptions to 42,875 periodicals, and ranking among the nation's top research libraries.  The <a>American Library Association</a> ranks the Rutgers University Library system as the 44th largest library in the United States in terms of volumes held.</p>
<p>The <em><a>Archibald S. Alexander</a> Library</em>, in <a>New Brunswick</a>, is the oldest and the largest library of the University. It houses several million volumes focusing on an extensive <a>humanities</a> and <a>social science</a> collection. It mainly supports the sort of research done in the School of Arts and Sciences, the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning &amp; Public Policy, the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the School of Communication and Information. Alexander Library also maintains a large collection of government documents, which contains United States, New Jersey, foreign, and international government publications. It was officially established as the Library of Science and Medicine in July 1964 although the beginning of the development of a library for science started in 1962. The LSM currently has two administrative structures since it is a joint library serving both Rutgers and the <a>University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</a> (UMDNJ). UMDNJ, which was briefly known as <em>Rutgers Medical School</em>, separated from Rutgers in 1970. The current character of the LSM is a university science library also serving a medical school. On the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, in addition to Alexander Library, many individual disciplines have their own libraries, including alcohol studies, <a>art history</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Math</a>ematical studies, <a>Music</a>, and <a>Physics</a>.  <em>Special Collections and University Archives</em> houses the Sinclair New Jersey Collection, manuscript collection, and rare book collection, as well as the University <a>Archives</a>. Although located in the Alexander Library building, <a>Special Collections</a> and University Archives actually comprises a distinct unit unto itself. Also located within the Alexander Library is the <em>East Asian Library</em> which holds a sizable collection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean monographs and periodicals. In <a>Newark</a>, the <em>John Cotton Dana Library</em>, the <em><a>Institute of Jazz Studies</a></em> (located within the Dana Library), and the <em><a>Paul Robeson</a> Library</em> in <a>Camden</a>, serve their respective campuses with a broad collection of volumes.</p>
<p>Rutgers oversees several museums and collections that are open to the public, including the <em>Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum</em>, on the College Avenue Campus in <a>New Brunswick</a>, maintains a collection of over 50,000 works of art, focusing on Russian and <a>Soviet</a> art, French 19th-century art and <a>American</a> 19th- and 20th-century art with a concentration on early-20th-century and contemporary prints.  The <em>Rutgers University Geology Museum</em>&mdash;in Geology Hall next to the Old Queens Building&mdash;features exhibits on <a>geology</a> and <a>anthropology</a>, with an emphasis on the natural history of <a>New Jersey</a>. The largest exhibits include a <a>dinosaur</a> <a>trackway</a> from <a>Towaco, New Jersey</a>; a <a>mastodon</a> from <a>Salem County</a>; and a <a>Ptolomaic</a> era <a>Egypt</a>ian <a>mummy</a>.  On the Cook Campus, the <a>New Jersey Museum of Agriculture</a> houses an extensive collection of agricultural, scientific and household tools that spans 350 years of New Jersey's history. The bulk of the collection rests on the 8,000-item Wabun C. Krueger Collection of Agricultural, Household, and Scientific Artifacts, and over 30,000 glass negatives and historic <a>photographs</a>.  Also located on the Cook Campus is <em>Rutgers Gardens</em>, which features 50&nbsp;<a>acre</a>s (20&nbsp;<a>hectare</a>s) of horticultural, display, and <a>botanical gardens</a>, as well as <a>arboretum</a>s.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>[[Image:Selman Waksman NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Prof. [[Selman A. Waksman]] (B.Sc. 1915), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for developing 22 antibiotics&mdash;most notably Streptomycin&mdash;in his laboratory at Rutgers University.]]</p>
<p>Rutgers is home to the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science, also known as RUCCS. Researchers in <a>psychology</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, <a>electrical engineering</a>, and <a>anthropology</a> combine resources to advance the study of the mind at this state of the art institution. </p>
<p>It was at Rutgers that <a>Selman Waksman</a> (1888&#x2013;1973) discovered several <a>antibiotic</a>s, including <a>actinomycin</a>, <a>clavacin</a>, <a>streptothricin</a>, <a>grisein</a>, <a>neomycin</a>, <a>fradicin</a>, <a>candicidin</a>, <a>candidin</a>, and others. Waksman, along with graduate student <a>Albert Schatz</a> (1920&#x2013;2005), discovered <a>streptomycin</a>&mdash;a versatile antibiotic that was to be the first applied to cure <a>tuberculosis</a>. For this discovery, Waksman received the <a>Nobel Prize for Medicine</a> in 1952.</p>
<p>Rutgers developed water-soluble sustained release polymers, <a>tetraploids</a>, robotic hands, <a>artificial bovine insemination</a>, and the ceramic tiles for the <a>heat shield</a> on the <a>Space Shuttle</a>. In health related field, Rutgers has the Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Science Institute (EOHSI).</p>
<p>Rutgers is also home to the RCSB Protein Data bank, 'an information portal to Biological Macromolecular Structures' cohosted with the <a>San Diego Supercomputer Center</a>. This database is the authoritative research tool for bioinformaticists using protein primary, secondary and tertiary structures world wide.'</p>
<p>Rutgers is home to the Rutgers Cooperative Research &amp; Extension office, which is run by the Agricultural and Experiment Station with the support of local government. The institution provides research &amp; education to the local farming and agro industrial community in 19 of the 21 counties of the state and educational outreach programs offered through the <a>New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station Office of Continuing Professional Education</a>.</p>
<p>Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR) is the largest university based repository in the world and has received awards worth more than $57.8 million from the <a>National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH). One will fund genetic studies of mental disorders and the other will support investigations into the causes of digestive, liver and kidney diseases, and diabetes. RUCDR activities will enable gene discovery leading to diagnoses, treatments and, eventually, cures for these diseases. RUCDR assists researchers throughout the world by providing the highest quality biomaterials, technical consultation, and logistical support.</p>
<p>Rutgers-Camden is home to the nation's PhD granting Department of Childhood Studies. This department, in conjunction with the Center for Children and Childhood Studies, also on the Camden campus, conducts interdisciplinary research which combines methodologies and research practices of sociology, psychology, literature, anthropology and other disciplines into the study of childhoods internationally.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Rutgers Inter-Campus shuttle bus</a> Rutgers University offers a variety of housing options. On the <a>New Brunswick</a>-Piscataway campus, students are given the option of on-campus housing in both traditional <a>dorm</a>s or apartments. Despite some overcrowding, most students seeking on-campus housing will be accommodated with a space, yet in 2008/2009 students were placed in a nearby hotel. The hotel situation is expected to grow into 2009/2010 and students are encouraged to look off campus. Many Rutgers students opt to rent apartments or houses off-campus within the city of New Brunswick. Similar setups are to be found in Rutgers-Newark and Rutgers-Camden, however a substantial portion of the students on those campuses commute and are enrolled on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>Rutgers University's three campuses are in the culturally-diverse, redeveloping urban areas (<a>Newark</a>, <a>Camden</a>, and <a>New Brunswick</a>) with convenient access to New York City and <a>Philadelphia</a> by either <a>automobile</a>, <a>Amtrak</a> or <a>New Jersey Transit</a>. <a>US News &amp; World Report</a> ranked <a>Rutgers-Newark</a> the most diverse university campus in the United States. Because the area of Rutgers' New Brunswick-Piscataway campus&mdash;which is composed of several constituent colleges and professional schools&mdash;is sprawled across six <a>municipalities</a>, the individual campuses are connected by an inter-campus <a>bus</a> system.</p>
<p>Rutgers University has been called a &quot;party school&quot; by collegehumor.com, ranking 30 in their list, as well as receiving an &quot;honorable&quot; mention by partyschoolnetwork.com. The New Brunswick and Rutgers police frequently issue noise violations to off campus students which average between $350&#x2013;500, but do not usually target individuals, except when in possession of open containers in public.</p>
<h3>Traditions and symbols</h3>
<p> The school song of Rutgers University is <em><a>On the Banks of the Old Raritan</a></em>, written by Howard Fullerton (Class of 1874) in 1873. Although Rutgers incorporates the colors black and white on their signs, symbols, athletic uniforms as accent colors, scarlet is the one and only color of the university. The current mascot is the Scarlet Knight. In its early days, Rutgers athletes were known as &quot;Queensmen&quot; in reference to the institution's first name, Queen's College. However, in 1925, the <a>mascot</a> was changed to <a>Chanticleer</a>, a fighting rooster from the <a>medieval</a> <a>fable</a> <em><a>Reynard the Fox</a></em> (<em>Le Roman de Renart</em>) which was used by <a>Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s in the <em><a>Canterbury Tales</a></em>. However, this mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with &quot;being <a>chicken</a>.&quot; In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election.  This motto appears in the University's <a>seal</a> (<em>pictured above</em>), which is also derived from that of the University of Utrecht, and depicts a multi-pointed sun.</p>
<p>At Commencement exercises in the Spring, tradition leads undergraduates to break <a>clay pipes</a> over the <em>Class of 1877 Cannon</em> monument in front of <a>Old Queens</a>, symbolizing the breaking of ties with the college, and leaving behind the good times of one's undergraduate years. This <a>symbol</a>ic gesture dates back to when pipe-smoking was fashionable among undergraduates, and many college memories were of evenings of pipe smoking and revelry with friends. During commencement exercises, graduating seniors walk in <a>academic procession</a> under the <em>Class of 1902 Memorial Gateway</em> (erected in 1904) on Hamilton Street leading to the <a>Voorhees Mall</a> where the ceremonies are held for Rutgers College. Traditionally, students are warned to avoid walking beneath the gate before commencement over a <a>superstition</a> that one who does will not graduate.</p>
<h4>Coat of arms</h4>
<p>The shield of the Rutgers <a>coat of arms</a> appears on the university <a>gonfalon</a>, and is at the head of all processions. The first quarter bears the arms of Nassau, the <a>House of Orange</a>, and recognizes the Dutch founders. The arms in the upper sinister quarter are those of <a>George III</a> combined with Queen Charlotte's. It was George III who granted the Charter of 1766 to Queen's College, named in honor of <a>Charlotte of Mecklenburg</a>, King George's consort. The arms shown on the sinister half are Queen Charlotte's. The third quarter from the Seal of the State of New Jersey. The fourth quarter is the coat of arms of Colonel <a>Henry Rutgers</a>. [[Image:Rutgers Shield.png|thumb|right|150px|The University [[Coat of Arms]] (or shield) is used during all Academic processions]]</p>
<h4>Seal</h4>
<p>The University Seal based on that of the <a>University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands whose motto around a sun is &quot; Sol iustitiae nos illustra&quot;:&quot;Sun of righteousness, shine upon us&quot;. Rutgers modified the Utrecht seal to read &quot;Sol iustitiae et occidentem illustra&quot;; embracing the Western world, meaning &quot;Sun of righteousness, shine upon the West also.&quot; The boards of governors and trustees approved a revised seal for the University 1997 that includes the words &quot;Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey&quot; and adds the 1766 founding date.</p>
<h3>Student organizations and activities</h3>
<p> Rutgers University has a student government which controls funding to student groups. The student government is made up of campus councils and professional school councils. Those councils then send representatives to the student assembly as well as the university senate. An example of these campus councils is the College Avenue Council, which represents students on the College Avenue Campus.</p>
<p>Rutgers hosts over 700 <a>student organization</a>s, covering a wide range of interests. Among the first student groups was the first <a>college newspaper</a> in the <a>United States of America</a>. <em>The Political Intelligencer and New Jersey Adviser</em> began publication at Queen's College in 1783, and ceased operation in 1785. Governed by the <em>Student Activities Council</em>, and funded by student fees disbursed through <a>student government</a> associations, students can organize groups for practically any political ideology or issue, ethnic or religious affiliation, academic subject, activity, or hobby.</p>
<p>Rutgers University is home to chapters of many Greek organizations, and a significant percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. Several <a>fraternities and sororities</a> maintain houses for their chapters in the area of Union Street (known familiarly as &quot;Frat Row&quot;) in <a>New Brunswick</a>, within blocks of Rutgers' College Avenue Campus. Chapters of <a>Zeta Psi</a> and <a>Delta Phi</a> organized at Rutgers as early as 1845. There are over 50 fraternities and sororities on the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, ranging from traditional to historically <a>African-American</a>, <a>Hispanic</a>, <a>Multicultural</a>, and <a>Asian</a> interest organizations. The New Brunswick campus of Rutgers University has a chapter of the only active co-ed Pre-medical Fraternity, <a>Phi Delta Epsilon</a>, as of 2008. Greek organizations are governed by the <em>Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs</em>. Twelve organizations maintain chapters in New Brunswick without sanction by the University's administration.</p>
<p>In the late 19th century, the University banned fraternities because of their unusual hazing practices. This caused them to go underground as secret societies. It also sparked the interest of some students to create their own societies. <a>Cap and Skull</a> was founded at Rutgers before the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Today, Rutgers is well known for 4 of its vocal ensembles: Voorhees Choir (the university's most esteemed women's ensemble), Kirckpatrick Choir (the university's most esteemed coed ensemble), Glee Club (the university's most esteemed male ensemeble), and, to a lesser extent, University Choir.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p></p>
<p>[[Image:MiltonFriedman.jpg|thumb|left|Rutgers alumnus [[Milton Friedman]] (A.B. 1932)]] Since 1774, when the entire graduating class consisted of one student, <a>Matthew Leydt</a>, there have been over 335,000 graduates, or <a>alumni</a>, of Rutgers University. Several alumni have been awarded the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>, including <a>Michael Shaara</a> (A.B. 1951), author of <em><a>The Killer Angels</a></em> and other <a>historical fiction</a>, in <a>Fiction</a> (1975), journalist <a>Richard Aregood</a> (B.A. 1965) in <a>editorial writing</a> (1985), <a>Roy Franklin Nichols</a> (A.B. 1918) in <a>history</a> (1949), and <a>Junot D&#x00ed;az</a> in <a>fiction</a> (2008).</p>
<p>Alumni of Rutgers have had a considerable impact in the arts, including those by two noted modern sculptors, <a>George Segal</a> (M.A. 1963) and <a>Alice Aycock</a> (B.A. 1968). Many notable buildings in <a>Boston</a> (the <a>Copley Plaza Hotel</a>), and New York City including the <a>The Dakota</a>, <a>Plaza Hotel</a>, the <a>Waldorf</a> and <a>Astoria</a> Hotels (demolished in 1929 to make way for the <a>Empire State Building</a>) as well as several of the oldest buildings on the Rutgers University campus in New Brunswick, were designed by architect <a>Henry Janeway Hardenburgh</a> (A.B. 1871). Poet <a>Joyce Kilmer</a> (Class of 1908), attended Rutgers for two years before transferring to <a>Columbia University</a>, was famous for his poem &quot;Trees&quot; and later died in World War I, and <a>Robert Pinsky</a> (B.A. 1962), was appointed <a>Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress</a> in 1997. Filmmaker and critic <a>Wheeler Winston Dixon</a> (Ph.D. 1982) has written more than twenty five books on film history, theory and criticism, and his collected films are housed at <a>The Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York City.</p>
<p>Many Rutgers graduates have gone on to careers in public service, including former <a>U.S. Secretary of State</a> and <a>Senator</a> <a>Frederick T.

<p>[[File:RayRice27.jpg|thumb|right|Rutgers alumnus [[Ray Rice]]]] Graduates of Rutgers have gone on to make advances in medicine, mathematics and science, most notably Nobel Laureate <a>Selman A. Waksman</a> (B.Sc. 1915), but also including Peter C. Schultz (B.S. 1967), co-inventor of <a>fiber optics</a>, geneticist <a>Stanley N. Cohen</a> (B.Sc. 1956) who pioneered in the field of <a>gene splicing</a>, <a>Louis Gluck</a> (B.S. 1930) the &quot;father of <a>neonatology</a>&quot;, computer pioneer <a>Nathan M. Newmark</a> (B.S. 1948) who won the <a>National Medal of Science</a>, and Matthew Golombek (B.S. 1976) who was the project scientist in charge of NASA's Pathfinder mission to <a>Mars</a>.</p>
<p>Rutgers alumni have entertained Americans on the silver screen as well as the small screen, including most notably <a>James Gandolfini</a> (B.A. 1983), known for his role on <em><a>The Sopranos</a></em>, and <a>Oswald &quot;Ozzie&quot; Nelson</a> (B.A. 1927), fondly remembered for <em><a>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a></em>. Porn film star <a>Asia Carrera</a> (B.A. 1996), also a <a>Mensa</a> member, became the most famous porn actress of her generation. The Food Network has rocketed Chef and Restaurateur <a>Mario Batali</a> (B.A. 1982) into America's homes. Other notable thespian alumni include <a>Avery Brooks</a> (B.A. 1973) (<em><a>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>), Alan Semok (B.A. 1975) (<em><a>Shining Time Station</a></em>, <em><a>K.I.D.S.-TV</a></em>), <a>Kristin Davis</a> (B.F.A. 1987), (<em><a>Sex and the City</a></em>), and <a>Calista Flockhart</a> (B.F.A. 1988) (<em><a>The Birdcage</a></em>, <em><a>Ally McBeal</a></em>).</p>
<p>In athletics, graduates of Rutgers have won Olympic gold medals, been inducted into sports halls of fame, and led numerous teams as general managers and coaches including <a>Major League Baseball</a> manager <a>Jeff Torborg</a> (B.A. 1963), <a>Eddie Jordan</a> (B.A. 1977), coach of the <a>Philadelphia 76ers</a>, <a>Sonny Werblin</a> (A.B. 1932), former owner of the <a>New York Jets</a>, and <a>David Stern</a> (B.A. 1963), Commissioner of the <a>National Basketball Association</a>.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><em>(Note: The <a>Rutgers-Camden</a> athletic teams are called the <a>Scarlet Raptors</a>. The <a>Rutgers-Newark</a> athletic teams are called the <a>Scarlet Raiders</a>. The <a>Scarlet</a> Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA <a>Division III</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Rutgers was among the first American institutions to engage in intercollegiate athletics, and participated in a small circle of schools that included <a>Yale University</a>, <a>Columbia University</a> and long-time rival, <a>Princeton University</a> (then called <em>The College of New Jersey</em>). The four schools met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in <a>Manhattan</a> on 19 October 1873 to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition, and particularly to codify the new game of <a>football</a>. Though invited, <a>Harvard</a> chose not to attend. In the early years of intercollegiate athletics, the circle of schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the American Northeast. However, by the turn of the 20th century, colleges and universities across the United States began to participate.</p>
<p>In 1864, rowing became the first organized sport at Rutgers. Six mile races were held on the Raritan River among six-oared boats. In 1870, Rutgers held its first intercollegiate competition, against the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the then top-ranked amateur crew of the time. Since the start in 1864, Rutgers has built a strong crew program consisting of heavyweight and lightweight men. Women's crew was added to the program in 1974. Men's crew was recently discontinued as a varsity sport at Rutgers, though it continues as a strong club program. &lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Firstfootballgame.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Drawing from the [[1869 college football season|first football game played]] between Rutgers and Princeton.]] --&gt; The first intercollegiate athletic event at Rutgers was a baseball game on 2 May 1866 against Princeton in which they suffered a 40-2 loss. Rutgers University is often referred to as <em>The Birthplace of College Football</em> as the first <a>intercollegiate football</a> <a>game was held</a> on College Field between Rutgers and Princeton on 6 November 1869 in <a>New Brunswick, New Jersey</a> on a plot of ground where the present-day <a>College Avenue Gymnasium</a> now stands. Rutgers won the game, with a score of 6 runs to Princeton's 4. According to <a>Parke H. Davis</a>, the 1869 Rutgers football team shared the national title with Princeton. (This game is believed to have been closer to soccer than to modern American football.) <a>thumb|234px|The Rutgers College football team in 1882.</a> Since 1866, Rutgers remained unaffiliated with any formal athletic conference and was classified as &quot;independent&quot;. From 1946 to 1951, the university was a member of the <a>Middle Three Conference</a>, and from 1958 to 1961, was a member of the <a>Middle Atlantic Conference</a>. In 1978, Rutgers became a member of the <a>Atlantic 10</a> conference. In 1991, it joined the <a>Big East Conference</a> for football. All sports programs at Rutgers subsequently became affiliated with the Big East in 1995.</p>
<p>The first intercollegiate competition in <a>Ultimate Frisbee</a> (now called simply &quot;Ultimate&quot;) was held between students from Rutgers and <a>Princeton</a> on November 6, 1972 to mark the one hundred third anniversary of the first intercollegiate football game. Rutgers won 29&ndash;27.</p>
<p>The Rutgers Men's Basketball Team was among the &quot;Final Four&quot; and ended the 1976 season ranked fourth in the United States, after an 86&ndash;70 loss against the <a>University of Michigan</a> in the semifinals, and a 106&ndash;92 loss against <a>UCLA</a> in the consolation round of the <a>1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Seniorday.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] fullback No. 23 Brian Leonard (class of 2007), conducts the band as it plays the school song, 'On the Banks of the Old Raritan' after his last home game against Syracuse University on November 25, 2006.]]Since 1991, Rutgers is a member of the <a>Big East Conference</a>, a collegiate athletic conference consisting of 16 colleges and universities from the East Coast and <a>Midwestern</a> regions of the United States. The Big East Conference is a member of the <a>Bowl Championship Series</a>. Rutgers currently fields 27 intercollegiate sports programs and is a <a>Division I</a> school as sanctioned by the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>. Rutgers fields thirty teams in NCAA Division I sanctioned sports, including <a>Football</a>, <a>Baseball</a>, <a>Basketball</a>, <a>Crew</a>, <a>Cross Country</a>, <a>Fencing</a>, <a>Field Hockey</a>, <a>Golf</a>, <a>Gymnastics</a>, <a>Lacrosse</a>, <a>Soccer</a>, <a>Softball</a>, <a>Tennis</a>, <a>Track and Field</a>, <a>Swimming</a> and <a>Diving</a>, <a>Wrestling</a>, <a>Volleyball</a>.</p>
<p>Since joining the Big East, the Scarlet Knights have won five Big East Conference tournament titles: men's <a>soccer</a> (1997), men's <a>track &amp; field</a> (2005), <a>baseball</a> (2000, 2007), <a>women's basketball</a> (2007). Several other teams have won regular season titles but failed to win the conference's championship tournament.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights' football team has achieved success on the gridiron after several years of losing seasons, being invited to the <a>Insight Bowl</a> on 27 December 2005 in which they lost 45 to 40 against <a>Arizona State University</a>.  This was Rutgers' first bowl appearance since the 16 December 1978 loss against Arizona State, 34&ndash;18, at the <a>Garden State Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>The 2006 football season also saw Rutgers being ranked within the Top 25 teams in major college football polls. After the 9 November 2006 victory over the #3 ranked, undefeated <a>Louisville Cardinals</a>, Rutgers jumped up to seventh in the <a>AP Poll</a>, eighth in the <a>USA Today/Coaches poll</a>, seventh in the <a>Harris Interactive Poll</a>, and sixth in the <a>Bowl Championship Series</a> rankings. These were Rutgers' highest rankings in the football polls since they were ranked fifteenth in 1961. Rutgers ended the season 11&ndash;2 after winning the inaugural <a>Texas Bowl</a> on 28 December 2006, defeating the <a>Wildcats</a> of <a>Kansas State University</a> by a score of 37&ndash;10 and finishing the season ranked twelfth in the final <a>Associated Press</a> poll of sportswriters, the team's highest season-ending ranking.</p>
<p>Under Head Coach <a>C. Vivian Stringer</a>, the Women's Basketball program is among the elite programs in the country as they remain consistently ranked in the Top 25, consistently making the NCAA Women's Championship Tournament, and sometimes winning the Big East regular season championship. In 2006-2007, Rutgers won their first ever Big East Conference Tournament Championship. The program has been highly competitive since its inception, winning the 1982 AIAW National Championship, reaching the 2000 Final Four, and reaching the Final Four and national championship game in 2007.</p>
<p>Rutgers maintains athletic rivalries with other collegiate institutions. The university has historic rivalries with <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>Columbia University</a> (formerly <em>King's College</em>), <a>Lafayette College</a>, <a>Lehigh University</a>  and <a>New York University</a> originating from the early days of college football. While they maintain this rivalry in other sports, neither of them have met in football since 1980. Rutgers has a basketball rivalry with <a>Seton Hall University</a>, and has developed a growing three-way rivalry with the <a>University of Connecticut</a> and <a>Syracuse University</a>, both fellow Big East Conference members.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2007, six Rutgers New Brunswick/Piscataway's NCAA Division I sports were discontinued by the University, including men's swimming and diving, men's heavyweight and lightweight crew, men's tennis, and men's and women's fencing.  Some continued as club teams, while some were disbanded completely. The University claims this change was due to budget cuts, while others claim it was a politically motivated move designed to protest state's funding changes.</p>
<h2>World records</h2>
<p>On April 10, 2008, students at Rutgers University broke the <a>Guinness World Record</a> for the &quot;Largest Gathering of People Dressed as Ninja Turtles.&quot;  786 members of the University community gathered at the recreation center in <a>Piscataway, New Jersey</a> to accomplish this feat.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 2, 2009 1,052 students, alumni, and members of the community at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA, captured the <a>Guinness World Record</a> for the &quot;Largest Gathering of People Dressed as Waldo.&quot; The event raised money for New Brunswick public schools.</p>
