<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dordt College was founded as Midwest Christian Junior College in 1953. In 1954, a group of men from local <a>Christian Reformed Churches</a> in <a>Iowa</a>, <a>South Dakota</a> and <a>Minnesota</a> agreed to establish the college in Sioux Center. At this time, it was tentatively referred to as Midwest Christian Junior College. </p>
<p>In April 1956, the name of the institution was changed to Dordt College. This name was chosen to honor a historic 17th century <a>Reformed</a> church meeting called the <a>Synod of Dort</a> that took place in the <a>Netherlands</a>. The first students to earn B.A. degrees graduated in 1965. with 30 majors and 11 pre-professional programs of study.</p>
<h3>Core curriculum</h3>
