<p><strong>Ruskin College</strong> is an independent educational institution in <a>Oxford</a>, <a>England</a>. It is named after the essayist and social critic <a>John Ruskin</a> (1819&#x2013;1900) and specialises in providing educational opportunities for adults with few or no qualifications. The college is not part of the <a>University of Oxford</a>, but strong relations with the University allow special privileges such as attending lectures and the use of most facilities. Ruskin College is among the eight non-university institutions whose members are eligible for Long-Term Temporary Membership in the <a>Oxford Union</a>.</p>
<h2>Mission and purpose</h2>
<p>The mission of the <a>College</a> has always been to provide educational opportunities to adults who are excluded and disadvantaged, and to transform the individuals concerned along with the communities, groups and societies from which they come, the only change having been to personalise the language (away from &#x2018;the excluded&#x2019;, who do not sound like people) in line with growing equalities awareness. The mission statement is twofold: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first aim, that of giving individuals a second chance in education, continues to be achieved by admitting those with few or no formal qualifications to courses of study that can result in, or lead on to, university-level qualifications.</li>
  <li>The second aim, the transformational element of the mission, is evidenced by the fact that the most frequent thing former students say about Ruskin is that it changed their lives. Students, whether or not they themselves are resident, benefit from studying in a setting with a strong sense of academic community and from the intensive tutorial teaching that Ruskin offers. The College is also transformational because it sees education as a vehicle for progressive social change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ruskin tends towards a curriculum that has high social relevance, students who want to make a difference in the world, and forms of academic scholarship and research that are engaged and applied.</p>
<p>Ruskin&#x2019;s mission is also pursued by means of strong historical links, nationally and internationally, with the labour and <a>trade union movement</a>, other social movements and activism around social issues (e.g., anti-<a>ageism</a>), as well as with local communities, for example through the Social Work and Youth and Community Work programmes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruskin College was established in 1899 specifically to provide educational opportunities for working class men, who were denied access to university. It was deliberately placed in <a>Oxford</a>, the city in which its young American founders Walter and his wife Anne L. Vrooman had studied, because the city symbolised the educational privilege and standards to which ordinary people could never previously have aspired. </p>
<p>Ruskin College became, in turn, a symbol of working people&#x2019;s education. It served as a model for labour colleges around the world, and <a>Gandhi</a> made a point of visiting during a brief stay in Oxford in 1931 because he had been so inspired by the writings of <a>John Ruskin</a> on workers&#x2019; education, just as the College founders had been.</p>
<p>Ruskin College was a secular sister-school to and model for <a>Plater College</a> until Plater's closing in 2005.</p>
<h2>College structure</h2>
<p>Student enrolments at Ruskin in 2005&#x2013;2006 reached their highest ever number in the College&#x2019;s history. Enrolments on long courses were 294 in total across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Short course enrolments reached 5,187 in total, including trade union courses, residential short courses and the largest ever Summer School. </p>
<p>In 2005-06, there were 78 full-time equivalent academic staff of whom 26 were teaching staff and 13 teaching support services staff. Progression rates are excellent, with 87% of students on undergraduate-level Humanities courses at Ruskin having come via short courses there, and a majority of students on long courses going on to degree-level study, both at Ruskin and elsewhere. Ruskin students go on to jobs in professional, trade union and political settings, amongst others.</p>
<h2>Courses offered</h2>
<p>Ruskin&#x2019;s educational work may be divided into further education activity (including short courses and external trade union courses), supported by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), and higher education work, funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and validated by the Open University Validation Services (OUVS). </p>
<p>The College&#x2019;s work in higher education constitutes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One year full time Certificates of Higher Education in Law; History; and Women's Studies (part time)</li>
  <li>Three year full time Undergraduate BA (Hons) degrees in English and Creative Writing; History with Social Sciences; International Labour and Trade Union Studies; Social Work; Sociology, Politics and Economics; and Youth and Community Work</li>
  <li>Three MA degrees in International Labour and Trade Union Studies, Public History and Women&#x2019;s Studies</li>

<h2>Ruskin Fellowship</h2>

Independent of but associated with the College, the Fellowship aims to support the work and ethos of the College in offering university-level education to disadvantaged adults in Britain. There is also a post graduate programme and an international section involving: International Labour and Trade Union Studies; Webb and Chevening Scholars.</p>

The current Ruskin Student Union President is Kit Johnson.</p>
<p>Notable former executive members of the RSU include John Prescott and Jack Ashley.</p>
<h2>Ruskin College Strike of 1909</h2>
<p>In 1908, a group of Ruskin students, dissatisfied with its education policy which they viewed as too pro-establishment and imbued with elements of &quot;social control&quot;, formed the <a>Plebs' League</a>. The students revolt was supported by the Principal, Dennis Hird, and following his dismissal the students took strike action, refusing to attend lectures.</p>
<h2>Relocation of the College</h2>
<p>A &#x00a3;20m redevelopment programme at the College&#x2019;s Old Headington site will enable Ruskin to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century in buoyant mood. The headquarters of the College will relocate there in September 2012. This will leave just a small amount of teaching at the city centre Walton Street site, which has been sold to Exeter College for a sum in the region of &#x00a3;12m. The relocation of the college has been highly controversial. The college was founded on the idea that it must be surrounded by great academia, Walton Street being suitably located just minutes from the Bodleian Library and seconds from the Ashmolean Museum. Although the redeveloped site at Headington will be high tech, it has been described by some as feeling rather remote and the Walton Street sight will be sorely missed by many.</p>
