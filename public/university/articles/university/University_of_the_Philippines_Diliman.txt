<p>  The <strong>University of the Philippines Diliman</strong> (<strong>UP Diliman</strong>, <strong>UPD</strong>, <strong>UPDil</strong> or informally as <strong>Peyups</strong>), is a <a>coeducational</a> and <a>public</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Quezon City</a>, <a>Philippines</a>. It is the <a>flagship university</a>, seat of administration and the fourth oldest constituent university of the <a>University of the Philippines System</a>. It also includes two extension program campuses in <a>Pampanga</a> and <a>Olongapo City</a>.</p>
<p>The university was originally founded as <em>American University of the Philippines</em> in Padre Faura St., <a>Manila</a> on 18 June 1908. After the liberation from the United States, the school was renamed as <em>University of the Philippines.</em> In 1948, newly-established <a>Republic of the Philippines</a> sited an area now known as <a>Quezon City</a> as the nation's capital. The next year, the university acquired 493-hectare area on the Diliman district of the city. The new campus was named as <em>University of the Philippines Diliman</em> and was assigned to be the university's seat of administration and main campus. Since its establishment in 1949, UP Diliman has expanded into more than 296 graduate, undergraduate and diploma courses, nine of which were declared as excellent programs by the <a>Commission on Higher Education</a> as of 2009. Between the 70s and 80s, UP Diliman was the site of much <a>student activism</a>. It was during these times when student demonstration and opposition against <a>Marcos</a> administration, as initiated by UP Diliman students, became heavy and aggressive. This was one of the precursors that led to Marcos' declaration of <a>martial law</a> in 1972.</p>
<p>Notable research units of UP Diliman include:<a>Marine Science Institute</a>, <a>National Institute of Geological Sciences</a>, <a>National Institute of Physics</a>, <a>National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</a>-Diliman, and the <a>National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development</a>, which are all pioneers of science research and development in the Philippines.&lt;br&gt; 54.

<h3>The Oblation and Academic Oval</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|UP Diliman's Oblation statue as viewed from the University Avenue.</a> Coming from the Commonwealth Avenue in <a>Quezon City</a>, UP Diliman is connected by a road named as University Avenue. The avenue stretches 800 meters where traffic enters the campus or going towards <a>C.P. Garcia</a> St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the <a>Oblation</a> Plaza of Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the main building fa&#x00e7;ade of the campus can be seen, the <a>Quezon</a> Hall.  The <strong><a>Oblation</a> statue</strong> () is the most iconic figure of UP Diliman. The statue was originally made by <a>National Artist</a> <a>Guillermo E. Tolentino</a> in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the UP System. To promote morality and censorship, UP President Jorge Bocobo suggested to put fig leaf to cover genitals. In 1950, the Board of Regents ordered the statue to be cast in bronze, which was furnished in <a>Italy</a> and was put into display in 1958.</p>
<p>Several replicas of Tolentino's Oblation statue were created during the creation of new UP campuses, some were made by the National Artist <a>Napoleon Abueva</a>. UP Diliman's Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino's. The original statue is now put on display on the third floor of the university's Main Library. Additionally, the Academic Oval is planted with over 500 <a>acacia</a> and fire trees.</p>
<p>During the centennial celebration of UP System, UP President Emerlinda Roman rehabilitated the inner circle of the Academic Oval. The transformation included the paving of the inner Oval and creation of commemorative tiles around the walkway for an exchange of price. The efforts are collected and distributed to form the UP Diliman Faculty Development Fund. On March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university. According to Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Cynthia Grace Gregorio, this policy also promotes to lower air pollution by creating biking lanes on the inner side of the circle.</p>
<h3>Carillon Tower</h3>
<p>[[File:University Carillon at the UP Campus in Diliman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The UP Carillon Tower as seen from [[Ramon Magsaysay|Magsaysay]] Avenue near the UP Film Institute.]] The only <a>carillon</a> tower in the <a>Philippines</a> and in <a>Southeast Asia</a> that is manually played by a <a>clavier</a> or a wooden keyboard, the <strong>UP Carillon</strong> towers about 130 feet tall. The UP Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by <a>National Artist</a> <a>Juan Nakpil</a>, <a>Conservatory of Music</a> director Ramon Tapales and <a>UP President</a> Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower the grounds of the university. Several years later, on 1 August 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the UP Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four <a>octave</a>s were installed by the Dutch carilloneeur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the UP Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Apart from playing the UP's anthem <em><a>UP Naming Mahal</a></em> (UP Beloved), the Carillon tuned many music such as the <em>Magtanim ay Di Biro</em> (Planting Rice, a Filipino folk song) and <a>The Beatles</a> sounds. During this time, UP students declared the university as a republic and as a separate entity from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to age and rust, the Carillon ceased to play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of <em>UP Naming Mahal</em> and <em>Push On UP!</em> (UP Diliman's athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December's Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned. After two years, the Project was able to collect PhP 14 million which will be used to cleanup and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Carillon was formally reintroduced to the public after two years of restoration. The original 48 bells were put into archives and are now replaced by 36 bells bought from <a>Dutch</a> company <a>Petit and Fritsen</a> for PhP 12 million whereas the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% combination of <a>zinc</a>, <a>magnesium</a> and <a>phosphorus</a>. At the same time, the largest of these bells weighs 635 kilograms and the smallest weighs 14 kilograms.</p>
<p>Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name <em>Sunken Garden</em> due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to university's height of over hundreds of meters above sea level). The Sunken Garden is usually the venue for sports tournament like <a>frisbee</a>, <a>soccer</a>, and <a>volleyball</a> clinics as well as the annual UP Fair. Sometimes, <a>ROTC</a> trainings are done here by the Department of Military Science and Tactics. Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that is prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue. Campuses under the University of the Philippines are headed by a single chancellor. The first chancellor of UP Diliman was <a>Senator</a> <a>Edgardo J. Angara</a>, whose office was created in 26 April 1982. The Chancellor is assisted by five Vice Chancellors &mdash; for Academic Affairs, Administration, Community Affairs, Research and Development and Student Affairs. The current chancellor is Dr. Sergio S. Cao, who was appointed by the Board of Regents into position on its 1193rd meeting, 25 February 2005.</p>
<p>Apart from heading the university, the Chancellor also holds administrative works that represents the Board of Regents to the campus level. The Chancellor is also the chairperson directing the University Council, an internal coordinating body that composed the Chancellor himself, the University Registrar as the secretary, and the professors, associate professors and assistant professors as members. The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, on the other hand, assists the Chancellor in coordinating curricular, instructional and library programs among others of the university. The Vice Chancellor for Administration assists the Chancellor in administrative management of the campus. Similarly, the Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs assists the Chancellor for promoting relationships with the university itself and the residents in-campus, the local government and safety. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Development assists the Chancellor for formulating guidelines and criteria for research and development of the university. Finally, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs assists the Chancellor for promoting wellness and discipline among students such as health and food services and scholarship management.</p>
<h3>Colleges and institutes</h3>
<p>[[Image:MalcolmHall.jpg|thumb|right|The Malcolm Hall, named after the college's first dean, [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] <a>Justice</a> <a>George Malcolm</a> houses the <a>College of Law</a>.]] The academic arms of the university are called <a>college</a>s, <a>institute</a>s or <a>school</a>s. A number of colleges and schools offer undergraduate, graduate and diploma courses while some offer only a specific academic field. Most institutes offer no courses but provide research facilities for academic development.</p>
<p>Each college or school is headed by a single dean, who is appointed by the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines upon the recommendation of the Chancellor and the President of UP themselves. The dean acts as the head of the faculty of his college and assumes administrative works assigned by the Board. The dean has tenure of three years, which, may be extended up to two terms upon reappointment. The associate dean, on the other hand, is the second head of a college/school and assists the dean for administration of the college/school. The tenure of the associate dean is determined by the Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the Chancellor and the dean of the college/school.</p>
<p>It must be noted that some of the colleges of UP Diliman assumes the title of &quot;Institute&quot; (such as Asian Institute of Tourism) and thus consists of departments. It must also be noted that colleges of UP Diliman contains institute (such as Institute of Civil Engineering of College of Engineering). Some colleges also use the title &quot;School&quot; (such as School of Economics) and thus consists of departments. In summary, a college may be composed of departments and institutes (or national institutes) and a school may also contains both. An institute, on the other hand, may be under a college or school, or a standalone research institute (such as the Institute of Islamic Studies).</p>
<p>An institute is headed by the institute director, who also assumes the duties represented by the Chancellor to his department. The director has a tenure of three years, which may be extended up to two terms upon the reappointment of the Chancellor. A director should not be an academic head of any department or division under his institute. Each college/school is composed of clusters of departments or institutes. Most academic programs are offered by the departments/institutes. A department is headed by the department chair, who assumes the duties represented by the dean and Chancellor to his department. The chair is appointed by the Chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and a tenure of three years which may be extended up to two terms upon reappointment. The head of a national institute, also the director, is not appointed by the Chancellor but by the President of the University of the Philippines instead.</p>
<p>The university is composed of 26 colleges, schools and institutes. Officially, these are called <em>degree-granting units</em>. The oldest of these colleges is the <a>College of Fine Arts</a>, established in 1908 and originally located in Manila. On the other hand, the first college to operate in the Diliman campus is the <a>Conservatory of Music</a> (then College of Music) in 1949. &lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Culture, sports and traditions</h2>
<p>The Diliman community is sometimes called the <em>Diliman Republic</em> and a &quot;microcosm of the Philippines&quot;. It is the only university in <a>Metro Manila</a> that has its own <a>jeepney</a> transportation owing to its size. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) and a television station. The university only operates <a>DZUP 1602</a>, a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses residential areas and students often feel a sense of solidarity with the community residents. It is monitored by the local U.P. Police. </p>
<p>U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System at the <a>University Athletic Association of the Philippines</a> (UAAP) and participates in all events. The <a>Fighting Maroons</a> have consistently placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP for the past several years. </p>
<p>Two of the most-awaited events in the campus are the Lantern Parade, held on the last week before the <a>Christmas</a> break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, groups within the University create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval. The U.P. Fair, organized by the <a>UP Diliman University Student Council</a>, is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features nightly music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides.</p>
<h2>Centennial Celebration</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Fireworks display at UP Diliman's Centennial Kick-off Celebration.</a> On January 8, 2008, the <a>University of the Philippines System</a> (UP), with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. The university has produced 7 of 14 presidents, 12 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, and an estimated 250,000 alumni (15,000 doctors, 8,000 lawyers and 23,000 teachers). </p>
<p>Fernando Javier, 100, of  <a>Baguio City</a>, oldest UP <a>alumnus</a> (<a>Civil Engineering</a> from <a>University of the Philippines Manila</a>, 1933), carried the 100-torch relay at the UP academic oval in <a>Diliman</a>, <a>Quezon City</a>. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the <a>University of the Philippines Integrated School</a> in UP Diliman. UP president Emerlinda Roman, first woman president, carried the 100th torch and ignited the centennial <a>cauldron</a> in the UP <a>Oblation</a>. </p>
<p>The cauldron featured 3 pillars representing the core values of Excellence, Leadership, and Service and 7 flowers representing the constituent universities, to wit, UP Manila, UP Diliman (together with UP Pampanga, its extension campus), UP Los Ba&#x00f1;os, UP Baguio, UP Visayas, UP Mindanao, and UP Open University.</p>
