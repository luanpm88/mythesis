<p>  <strong>Butler University</strong> is a private, co-educational <a>liberal arts</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Indianapolis</a>, <a>Indiana</a>, <a>United States</a>. Butler offers 60 degree programs to 4,400 students through six colleges: Business, Communication, Education, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and the Jordan College of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>In 1930, Butler merged with the Teacher's College of Indianapolis, founded by Eliza Blaker, creating the university's second college.  The third college, the College of Business Administration, was established in 1937, and the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences was established in 1945, following a merger that absorbed the Indianapolis College of Pharmacy.  The Jordan College of Fine Arts, the university's fifth college, was established in 1951, following a merger with the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music.  Butler's School of Religion, established in 1924, became independent in 1958 and is currently known as the <a>Christian Theological Seminary</a>.</p>
<p>Butler University was founded by members of the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a>, though it was never controlled by the church.</p>
<p>Butler built the  <strong>Health and Recreation Complex</strong> (HRC) in 2005. The HRC offers a jogging track around a two-court gymnasium, an aquatic complex, free-weight room, cardio and selectorized weight machine area, fitness assessment &amp; massage therapy room, two multipurpose rooms, and locker rooms.  Outside of the fitness dedicated space, the building houses a conference room, juice bar, and student lounge.</p>
<p>On May 8, 2008, Butler broke ground on a , four story addition to <strong>Pharmacy Building</strong>.  This building, designed by Browning Day Mullins Dierdorf, is home to faculty offices, classrooms, and laboratories to support Butler's Pharmacy and Physician Assistant (PA) programs.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>The <a>2009-2014 Campus Master Plan Draft</a> calls for additions and upgrades to buildings on campus as part of the university's ongoing effort to provide state-of-the-art facilities for its students.  The projects are separated into three categories:  near-term, mid-term, and long-term.</p>
<p>For the Arts &amp; Sciences, near-term projects include an addition to the Holcomb Building to meet the space needs for science, math, and computer science.  Also near-term are complete renovations to the floor-plan of Gallahue Hall and the renovation of Holcomb Observatory to upgrade the planetarium and observatory.  Mid-term projects include renovations to Jordan Hall to upgrade finishes and increase &quot;community&quot; space.  Following the science library's move to Irwin Hall, the space it currently occupies will also be renovated to community and study space.</p>
<p>Student Housing projects call for the near-term building of a new 3-story, 150-bed residence hall behind Schwitzer Hall.  Mid-term projects include renovations and infrastructure upgrades to convert Ross and Schwitzer Halls to contemporary standards, renovation of ResCo to upgrade finishes and convert selected areas back into community/gathering spaces, and the construction of remote parking across the canal to expand parking options on the core campus.  Long-term projects include the construction of a new 3-story, 150-bed residence hall West of Ross Hall, and a parking structure between Schwitzer Hall and Phi Kappa Psi to expand parking options in the residential zone of the core campus.  The university emphasizes practicality of knowledge and offers individual attention to its students with its small class size and no teaching assistants. Butler University increased its focus on faculty and student research with the Butler Institute for Research and Scholarship (BIRS), bolstered by a million dollar grant from the Lilly Endowment.  The University also provides student research opportunities, such as the Butler Summer Institute, a 10-week program where Butler students are granted funding to perform independent research with a faculty member.</p>
<h3>College of Business Administration</h3>
<p> Butler's College of Business Administration is accredited by the AACSB International and The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.  Butler's four year undergraduate business program began in 1937 and offers B.S. degrees in accounting, economics, finance, international management, management information systems, and marketing. The school boasts 650 undergraduates, as well as 300 MBA students.</p>
<h4>Butler Business Accelerator</h4>
<p>A unique program in the College&#x2013;the Butler Business Accelerator&#x2013;allows students to serve as consultants for central Indiana businesses.  Developed through a grant from the Lilly Endowment, the Accelerator is committed to providing students with opportunities to not only learn about business, but to experience business first-hand.  Operationally, the Accelerator is a consulting business designed to serve middle market companies in Indiana. Teams led by professional consultants supported by faculty and students work directly with these companies - helping them to grow and simultaneously providing a living laboratory in which undergraduate and MBA students learn and experience real business problems and situations. Since 2006, the Accelerator has touched 1,299 students through classroom collaborations with College of Business faculty, and 17 professors have worked with the Accelerator on client projects.</p>
<h3>College of Communication</h3>
<p> The faculty senate voted to support the creation of a College of Communication on March 23, 2010.  As a result, the College of Communication (CCOM) is Butler's newest college.  Under the tutelage of Interim Dean and longtime Professor of Communication Studies William Neher, CCOM includes programs currently run by the Department of Media Arts, the Department of Communication Studies and the Eugene S. Pulliam School of Journalism.  The mission of the college is to &quot;prepare students for success in our digital and global society.  Students will develop the ability to critically analyze and synthesize human and mediated communication, and learn to speak, write and create responsible messages across dynamic communication contexts and media platforms.&#x201d; For the past seven years, the College has experienced a 99 percent (or above) placement rate for its students.  The College also offers graduate degrees for those who complete the Experiential Program for Preparing School Principals (EPPSP), the master's program in school counseling, or the master's program for effective teaching and leadership.</p>
<h4>Washington Learning Program</h4>
<p>Butler University offers students a semester-long academic and internship program in Washington, DC.  Because of the wide variety of corporations, government offices, and cultural institutions located in the U.S. Capital, Butler students from any academic major in any college are afforded the opportunity to participate in this program.  The program coordinator, Ivo Spalatin, is a veteran of international and political affairs with over 20 years of experience as a senior policymaker in Congress and the State Department.  Mr. Spalatin works with students and faculty to individualize each student's experience in D.C. and monitors each student's internship and academic experiences throughout the semester.</p>
<h3>College of Pharmacy &amp; Health Sciences</h3>
<p> The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences offers the doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree that provides eligibility for licensure as a pharmacist. The College also offers a doctor of pharmacy with research emphasis, a graduate program leading to a master of science in pharmaceutical sciences degree, and a doctor of pharmacy/master of business administration program that awards both the Pharm.D. and M.B.A. degrees upon simultaneous completion of the respective degree requirements. The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences also offers a master of physician assistant studies (M.P.A.S.).</p>
<p>The College of Pharmacy at Butler University originated in 1904 with the founding of the Winona Technical Institute. In 1914, the pharmacy department separated from the institute to become the Indianapolis College of Pharmacy (ICP). In 1930 the ICP became one of the first pharmacy colleges to create a four-year baccalaureate curriculum. In 1945 Butler and the Indianapolis College of Pharmacy merged, and erected a new building on Butler's campus in 1950. The building, with its fully mediated classrooms and state-of-the-art research and teaching laboratories, was completely renovated in 2008-2009. The name of the college was changed to College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences when the Physician Assistant program was developed in 1995.</p>
<p>The Butler University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. The pharmacy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. By completion of the doctor of pharmacy curriculum, its graduates fulfill the educational requirements for examination and licensure as pharmacists in every state in the nation.  The 2010 edition of U.S. News &amp; World Report's annual educational rankings listed the Butler College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences 56th in the country in a listing of the top pharmacy colleges.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the pharmacy program, students are eligible to take the North American Pharmacy Licensing Exam ( NAPLEX), the national examination which leads to the licensure as a pharmacist. The passing rate for Butler pharmacy students on the NAPLEX is consistently above the national average, and in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 and 2008 it was 100%. We have the 7th highest board pass rates in the country, and we are the #1 private institution with a 99.26% passing rate.</p>
<p>Butler's Physician Assistant Program is a member of the Physician Assistant Education Association and is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant. Graduates of the Physician Assistant Program must sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE), the successful completion of which provides one the criteria for licensure or regulation.</p>
<p>JCFA's stated mission is to educate students in the arts as professions by means of its undergraduate and graduate programs. Such an education combines training in the arts disciplines with the development of a lifetime commitment to creativity and communication, nurturing the view of the arts as interrelated and responsible to society.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jordan College of Fine Arts offers both graduate and undergraduate programs, including degrees in Arts Administration, Dance, Dance-Performance, Dance-Pedagogy, Theatre, Recording Industry Studies, Multimedia, Electronic Media, Music Education, Music Composition, Instrumental Performance, Jazz Studies, Lyric Theatre, Music Performance, and Voice Performance.</p>
<h4>Theatre program</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- THIS SECTION NEEDS REFERENCES--&gt; Butler's Department of Theatre is known for producing works not commonly seen elsewhere.  Focusing on physical and international theatre, Butler has staged experimental interpretations of <a>Samuel Beckett</a>, a complete season of <a>Caryl Churchill</a> works, <em>St. Joan</em> as a montage performance piece and productions incorporating music, dance and media projection in collaboration with the other three departments of the Jordan College of Fine Arts.  Each summer a professional artist is invited to present a two-week intensive course on a topic not covered in the usual academic text.  This has included work with Italian and Russian directors, an Indian classical dancer, Australian installation artists and a multi-national montage performance group.</p>
<h3>Institute for Study Abroad</h3>
<p>The Institute for Study Abroad, Butler University (IFSA-Butler) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1988 at Butler University. It's stated primary goal is &quot;to provide quality study abroad opportunities, plus academic and personal support services, for qualified North American undergraduates seeking to earn academic credit through study abroad.&quot; While the Institute for Study Abroad is affiliated with Butler University, it is not a department of the university. IFSA-Butler currently operates programs in Argentina, Australia, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, England, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Peru, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  IFSA-Butler has awarded millions of dollars in merit- and need-based scholarships over the past five years. Awards range from $500 to $5,000.  Once a student finishes his or her study abroad program, Butler University processes the student's official transcript, with grade and credit translations, at no additional cost. Most colleges and universities in the U.S. treat the Butler University transcript as transfer credit.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL SEASONS SHOULD GO ON THE &quot;BUTLER BULLDOGS&quot; PAGE, NOT HERE --&gt;  <a>thumb|300px|Butler University athletics logo</a> Butler University's athletic teams, known as the <a><em>Bulldogs</em></a>, compete in the <a>NCAA</a> Division I <a>Horizon League</a> and compete at the Football Championship Series level in the <a>Pioneer Football League</a>. In the past decade, Butler teams have captured 26 conference championships (in four different leagues). The Bulldogs have made appearances in NCAA National Championship Tournaments in men's and women's basketball, men's soccer, volleyball, men's cross country, lacrosse, and baseball. Butler won the James J. McCafferty trophy, awarded annually by the conference for all-sports excellence based on conference championship points, seven times, including three-straight from 1996-97 to 1998-99 and back-to-back years in 2001-02 and 2002&#x2013;03, 2006&#x2013;07, and 2009-10.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> The Butler program has been one of the most successful so-called &quot;<a>mid-major</a>&quot; basketball programs over the last decade, having won at least 20 games and reached postseason play eight of the last ten seasons, including six <a>NCAA Tournament</a> appearances. Butler also holds two national championships in men's basketball from the pre-tournament era; one from 1924 (earned via the AAU national tournament), and one from 1929 (selected by the Veteran Athletes of Philadelphia).</p>
<p>In <a>2010</a>, Butler was runner-up to <a>Duke</a>, after advancing all the way to the National Championship after defeating <a>Michigan State</a> in the <a>Final Four</a>.  With a total enrollment of only 4,500 students, Butler is the smallest school to play for a national championship since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.</p>
<p>Butler has the best winning percentage and most wins of all D-I men's basketball programs in the state of <a>Indiana</a> over the last decade (21.6 wins per year through 2006), while having won the last six meetings with in-state rival <a>Notre Dame</a> and two of the last four against <a>Indiana</a>. Butler defeated both Notre Dame and Indiana during the 2006-07 regular season, while also defeating in-state rival Purdue to move to 2-0 against the Boilermakers this decade. Butler has also been the defending champion of the Hoosier Classic men's basketball tournament since the 2001-02 season, and has advanced to postseason play nine of the last eleven years (7 NCAAs, 2 NITs). Butler has been to nine NCAA Tournaments and three NIT's since 1997.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Butler has also had a rich tradition in football. Over the course of 60 seasons from 1934 to 1994, Bulldog football teams have won 31 conference championships. This includes seven straight Indiana Collegiate Conference titles from 1934 to 1940, league titles in 1946, 1947, 1952, and 1953, and seven straight from 1958 to 1964, all under the late great <a>Tony Hinkle</a>. Following the move from the College Division to NCAA Division II, Butler won 4 straight conference championships from 1972 to 1975, and in 1977, all under the guidance of Bill Sylvester, Sr. The Bulldogs and fellow ICC members added Ashland to form the Heartland Collegiate Conference. Butler went on to win league titles in 1983, 1985, and three straight from 1987 to 1989, under coach Bill Lynch. The Bulldogs also went to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1983 and 1988. Butler and fellow HCC member schools joined with the Great Lakes Valley Conference to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (now the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference). Butler football dominance continued in this new conference with a consistent, grinding running offense and aggressive, swarming defense which yielded MIFC Conference Championships in both 1991 and 1992. These championships included a trip to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1991 pairing Butler against eventual Division II champion Pittsburgh State, who survived in its most competitive game in their playoff run for the title. A true decade of football dominance from 1983 to 1994 including eight league titles in eleven years with three playoff berths, Butler football represented a culmination of discipline, commitment, and game-tenacity toward the goals of team achievement.</p>
<p>Following the 1992 season, Butler and member school Valparaiso moved up to NCAA Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) to join with Dayton, Drake, Evansville, and San Diego to form the <a>Pioneer Football League</a>. Butler completed the decade of dominance by winning another conference championship in 1994. In this era, &quot;the Dawgs&quot; were led by the great Arnold Mickens who broke numerous NCAA Division I rushing records, including eight straight 200&nbsp;yard performances during the campaign. In 2009, Butler won its 32nd league title by winning the PFL championship under coach Jeff Voris. The Bulldogs set a school record with 11 wins and went to the Gridiron Classic winning over Central Connecticut State 28-23.</p>
<h4>Hoosier Helmet Trophy</h4>
<p>The <strong>Hoosier Helmet</strong> was established as the trophy helmet for the rivalry football game played between Butler and <a>Valparaiso University</a>.  The Hoosier Helmet was created prior to the 2006 season to commemorate the football rivalry that has existed since 1921. The helmet trophy was created to further intensify the rivalry between these two teams. A group of Butler players, along with their head coach, <a>Jeff Voris</a>, came up with the idea for the helmet. After Valparaiso head coach Stacey Adams agreed to play for the helmet, Butler equipment manager John Harding put the helmet together.</p>
<p>The white helmet is mounted on a hardwood plaque and features each team's logo on respective sides of the helmet. A gold plate is added each year to commemorate the winner and score of the contest. Currently, Butler holds a 4-1 series lead when playing for the Hoosier Helmet.</p>
<p>Both Butler and Valparaiso compete in the NCAA FCS (formerly division 1-AA), non-scholarship <a>Pioneer Football League</a>.</p>
<h3>Men's soccer</h3>
<p>Butler's men's soccer qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2009, reaching the round of 16 in 1995 and 1998.  Butler won the Horizon League (formerly MCC) tournament title in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2001.  They also won or shared the regular season title six times, including 1994, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2008 and 2009.  The 1998 squad enjoyed national rankings as high as No. 8 in the country.</p>
<h3>Men's ice hockey</h3>
<p>In 2000, the Butler University Hockey Team won the <a>American Collegiate Hockey Association</a>'s Division III National Championship, beating national runner-up Georgia Tech.  The tournament was hosted by the U.S. Naval Academy. Butler currently competes in the Midwestern Collegiate Hockey Conference.</p>
<h3>Cross country</h3>
<p>Some of Butler's most notable athletic accomplishments have come in Cross Country. Butler has won nine straight Horizon League Championships in Men's Cross Country and five straight Women's Championships. The Men's team has placed as high as 4th in the nation in recent years, earning a team trophy at the NCAA Division I championships in 2004. Both teams have frequently qualified for nationals in recent years, placing individuals as high as 3rd (Mark Tucker, 2003). All-Americans from the Butler Cross Country Team include Julius Mwangi, Justin Young, Fraser Thompson (A Rhodes Scholar), Mark Tucker, Olly Laws, and Andrew Baker. Former coach, Joe Franklin, was named NCAA Division I Coach of the Year for leading the Bulldogs to their 2004 4th place finish.</p>
<h3>The Butler Bowl and Hinkle Fieldhouse</h3>
<p>  [[Image:Hinkle panorama inside.JPG|600px|thumb|center|An interior panorama of Butler University's [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]], constructed in 1928, during a game between the Bulldogs and the <a>University of Wisconsin Green Bay</a>.]]</p>
<p>From Butler's earliest days, athletics played a major role in shaping Butler University. When the school moved to its current Fairview campus location, two of the first structures completed were a 15,000-seat fieldhouse and a 36,000-seat football stadium. The football stadium, which came to be known as the <a>Butler Bowl</a>, is home to Butler's football and men's and women's soccer teams.  The stadium was downsized to a 20,000-seat stadium in the mid-1950s, and later seating dropped to below 6,000.  Recent changes to the Butler Bowl and its landscape have included removal of the Hilton U. Brown Theatre in 2004, installation of a synthetic turf playing surface in fall 2005 and the addition of the Apartment Village on the east side of the complex in 2006.  Construction has begun on a major renovation at the Butler Bowl that will include building a brick press box with multi-use booths and new seating on the west and east sides of the playing surface.  The renovation of the facility will increase the seating capacity to 5,647 with the addition of new bleacher seats along the west side of the field and a section of seating for visiting fans on the east side.  The brick press box will be approximately 40 yards long, reaching between the field&#x2019;s two 30-yard lines.  The main level will have home and visitor radio booths along with private booths for home and visiting coaches. Also, there will be an expanded area for game operations and the top level will house a video booth and an observation deck.</p>
<p>The fieldhouse, which was the largest of its kind when it was completed in 1928, is a historical landmark. The Butler Fieldhouse, which was renamed <a>Hinkle Fieldhouse</a> in 1966, came to symbolize not only Butler athletics, but also Indiana &quot;Hoosier Hysteria.&quot; The building became the combined home of Butler basketball and the Indiana High School state tournament. The legends of Indiana basketball, from Oscar Robertson to George McGinnis to Larry Bird, all played in the Fieldhouse at one time or another. In 1954, Hinkle Fieldhouse was the site of the historic final when <a>Milan</a> High School (enrollment 161) defeated <a>Muncie</a> Central High School (enrollment over 1,600) to win the state title. The state final depicted in the 1986 movie <em><a>Hoosiers</a></em>, loosely based on the <em>Milan Miracle</em> story, was shot in Hinkle Fieldhouse.</p>
<h3>Greek organizations</h3>
<p>Greek Life is a popular option at Butler with approximately 35% of undergraduates becoming members of social fraternities or sororities.  Fraternities and sororities have long been a part of student life at Butler, with the first fraternity established in 1859 and the first sorority established in 1874.  Today, representatives from each of the seven fraternities comprise the Interfraternity Council (IFC), which coordinates men's recruitment and works with the Panhellenic Council to plan all-campus events.  The Panhellenic Council has representatives from each of Butler's seven sororities and women's fraternities.</p>

In Indianapolis, most NPHC undergraduate chapters are city-wide chapters, meaning that the chapter is composed of students from more than one university. However, the Alpha Chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. is composed only of Butler students.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> - Kappa Chapter* (est. 1920)</li>
  <li><a>Sigma Gamma Rho</a> - Alpha Chapter (est. 1922)**</li>
