<h2>History</h2>
<p>The concept for Cosumnes River College was included in a Master Facility Need Study that was approved by the Board of <a>Trustees</a> of the <a>Los Rios Community College District</a> in February 1967.  A campus site of 180 <a>acre</a>s (0.7&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) was obtained and construction proceeded on a <a>library</a> building, a science building, an automotive and technology complex, a women's <a>physical education</a> building, and a <a>swimming pool</a>.  In the fall of 1970 the college opened with an initial enrollment of about 2,100.</p>
<p>In September 1975 the <a>Business</a>/<a>Social Science</a> building was dedicated, which included computer laboratories. In fall of 1990 the cafeteria building was opened, with facilities for both staff and student dining, and also for the instructional <a>food service</a> program. The next phase of construction was in the summer of 1991, which added the College Center building with space for the Admissions/Records, Financial Aid, Business Services, Administration and the book store. In fall of 1995 a <a>visual</a> and <a>performing arts</a> complex was opened, completing the roster of facilities in the college's original plan.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Folsom Lake Center was revamped as <a>Folsom Lake College</a>, as fourth community college under <a>Los Rios Community College District</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, the college became home to the <a>Sacramento Heatwave</a> of the <a>American Basketball Association</a> (ABA).</p>
