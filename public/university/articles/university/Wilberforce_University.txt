<p> <strong>Wilberforce University</strong> is a private, <a>coed</a>, <a>liberal arts</a> <a>historically black university</a> (HBCU) located in <a>Wilberforce, Ohio</a>.  Affiliated with the <a>African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church</a>, it was the first college to be owned and operated by <a>African Americans</a>.  It participates in the <a>United Negro College Fund</a>. </p>
<p>The founding of the college was unique as a collaboration in 1856 by the <a>Cincinnati, Ohio</a> Conference of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a> and the <a>African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> (AME).  They planned a college to provide classical education and teacher training for black youth.  Leaders of both races made up the first board members.  </p>
<p>When the number of students fell due to the <a>American Civil War</a> and financial losses closed the college, in 1863 the AME Church purchased the institution to ensure its survival.  Its first president, AME Bishop <a>Daniel A. Payne</a>, was one of the original founders.  Prominent supporters and the US government donated funds for rebuilding after a fire in 1865.  When the college added an industrial department in the late 19th century, state legislators could sponsor scholarship students.  </p>
<p>The college attracted the top professors of the day, including <a>W.E.B. Du Bois</a>.  In the 19th century, it enlarged its mission to include students from <a>South Africa</a>.  The university supports the national <a>Association of African American Museums</a> to broaden the reach of its programs and assist smaller museums with professional standards.  </p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Cooperative Education</h3>
<p>Wilberforce requires all students to participate in <a>cooperative education</a> to meet graduation requirements. The cooperative program places students in internships that provide practical experience in addition to academic training.</p>
<h3>NASA SEMAA project</h3>
<p>In October 2006, Wilberforce held the grand opening and dedication for the <a>NASA</a> Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA) and the associated Aerospace Education Laboratory (AEL). It was attended by Dr. Bernice G. Alston, deputy assistant administrator of NASA&#x2019;s office of Education, and the Honorable <a>David L. Hobson</a>, state representative from Ohio&#x2019;s 7th congressional district. </p>
<p>NASA&#x2019;s program is designed to provide training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to underprivileged students to support NASA&#x2019;s future needs. There are 17 NASA SEMAA project sites through the United States. Through this partnership, Wilberforce will offer training sessions for students in grades K-12 during the academic year and during the summer. The AEL is computerized classroom that provided technology to students in grades 7-12 that supports the SEMAA training sessions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Located three miles (5 km) from <a>Xenia, Ohio</a> in the southwestern part of the state, the founding of Wilberforce University was a collaboration between the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Mondays Methodist Episcopal Church.  They planned to promote classical education and teacher training for black youth.  Among the first 24 members of the Board of Trustees in 1855 were Bishop <a>Daniel A. Payne</a>, Rev. <a>Lewis Woodson</a> and Messrs. <a>Ishmael Keith</a> and <a>Alfred Anderson</a>, all of the AME Church.  Also on the Board were <a>Salmon P. Chase</a>, then <a>Governor of Ohio</a> and a strong supporter of abolition, as well as a member of the Ohio State Legislature, and other Methodist leaders from the white community.  They named the college after the British abolitionist and statesman, <a>William Wilberforce</a>.  </p>
<p>As a base for the college, the Cincinnati Conference bought a hotel, cottages and  of a <a>resort</a> property, named Tawawa Springs after a <a>Shawnee</a> word for &quot;clear or golden water&quot;.  The health resort was started because of the springs, which attracted summer people both from Cincinnati and <a>the South</a>.  Some people in this area of abolitionist sentiment were shocked when wealthy Southern planters arrived at the resort with their entourages of enslaved or free African-American mistresses and mixed-race &quot;natural&quot; children.  </p>
<p>Given migration patterns, this was also an area where numerous free blacks settled, many having migrated across the Ohio River from the South for better living conditions.  Xenia had quite a large free black population, as did other towns in southwestern Ohio, such as <a>Chillicothe</a>, Yellow Springs and Zanesville.  The towns had houses which were stations on the Underground Railroad in the years before the war, and Wilberforce College also supported freedom-seeking slaves.  </p>
<p>The college opened for classes in 1856, and by 1858 its trustees selected Rev. <a>Richard S. Rust</a> as the first President.</p>
<p>In 1888 the AME Church came to an agreement with the <a>Republican</a>-dominated state legislature that brought considerable financial support. It negotiated contemporary pressures to emphasize <a>iindustrial</a> education for many black youth by accommodating both that and the classical education. As an act of political patronage, the state legislature established a commercial, <a>normal</a> and industrial (CNI) department at Wilberforce College.  While this created complications for administration and questions about the mission of the college, in the near term it brought tens of thousands of dollars annually in state aid to the campus.  Each state legislator could award an annual scholarship to the CNI department at Wilberforce, enabling hundreds of African American students to attend classes. The state-funded students could complete liberal arts at the college, and students at Wilberforce could also take &quot;industrial&quot; classes.  By the mid-1890s, the college also admitted students from <a>South Africa</a>, as part of the AME Church's mission to Africa. The church helped support such students with scholarships, as well as arranging board with local families. In summary, the OIG found: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The University did not comply with the Title IV, HEA program requirements because it was not administratively capable. During the audit period, the University experienced significant staff turnover and lacked sufficient financial aid staff, failed to develop and implement written policies and procedures, did not maintain all records needed to demonstrate compliance with the HEA and applicable regulations, and did not ensure sufficient communication between the financial aid office and all other institutional offices at the University.&quot;</p>
