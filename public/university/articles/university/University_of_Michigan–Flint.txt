<p> The <strong>University of Michigan&#x2013;Flint</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>UM&#x2013;Flint</strong>, <strong>U of M&#x2013;Flint</strong> or simply <strong>Michigan Flint</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Flint, Michigan</a> in the <a>United States</a>. It is one of three campuses in the <a>University of Michigan</a> system.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The thought of establishing a part of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint started in the year 1837 when Sarah Miles wrote a letter to her family stating, &#x201c;A branch of the Michigan University at Ann Arbor is to be established in Flint at some future day.&#x201d; In May 1944 the Flint Board of Education requested that the University of Michigan open a <a>satellite campus</a> in <a>Flint</a>. Three years later, the <a>Board of Regents of the University of Michigan</a> funded a study exploring possibilities for higher education in Flint.</p>
<p>In June 1944 <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed the <a>G.I. Bill</a> into law. The demand for higher education increased with the return of soldiers after <a>World War II</a>, and was a major factor in the establishment of a branch of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint.</p>
<p>During February 1947 the Regents of the University of Michigan approved a higher education needs assessment for Flint.  In 1949, two Social Science professors at <a>Ann Arbor</a>, Arthur E. Lean and Franklin Killian, recommended a liberal arts college for Flint. <a>C.S. Mott</a> then offered $1 million for a four-year college in Flint. Later, in 1951, the Committee of Flint Citizens requested the Regents establish a four-year college in Flint. In January 1955 Governor Williams signed a $37,000 appropriation bill to cover preliminary expenses for the college; the Mott Foundation provided $1.2 million. Harlan Hatcher, Everett Cummings, and C.S. Mott broke ground for UM-Flint shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>After the 1952-1954 debate between the UM-Flint College Committee and the Flint Board of Education as to whether the UM Flint College should be a four-year liberal arts college or a two-year senior college, Hatcher and the Regents accepted the two-year senior college proposal. Later, in February 1956, David M. French was named the first dean of the Flint College of the University of Michigan. Since 2005, international student enrollment has increased over 200 percent, with students hailing from over 37 different countries.</p>
<p>Since 2004, student participation in the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) has increased nearly 800 percent. Over the same period of time, faculty participation in the program has gone up nearly 350 percent. From 2003 to 2007, UM-Flint faculty were awarded $18,947,526 in external funding for research projects.</p>
<h2>Residential and student life</h2>
<h3>On campus housing</h3>

<p>In November 2004, the <a>Board of Regents of the University of Michigan</a> approved the request of the Flint Campus to explore the feasibility of student housing. After several assessments, study, and, upon seeing the probable progression of growth of the campus, student housing was approved. On July 16, 2007 the first-ever student dormitory, the First Street Residence Hall, opened for students.. It is approximately 100,000 gross square feet and is situated on the southern edge of the campus adjacent to First Street and Wilson Park.  The  Residence Hall has 310 beds and living-learning spaces on the first floor. The facility differs from traditional dormitory buildings found on many college campuses. It features one, two, and four-bedroom units, including handicapped-accessible units. All units contain one or two bathrooms, a kitchen, and living room. In addition, the Residence Hall features a 24/7 staffed entry way with special cards that are required for entrance into the building.</p>
<h3>Off campus housing</h3>
