<p><strong>Oklahoma Panhandle State University</strong> (OPSU) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Goodwell, Oklahoma</a>. OPSU is a <a>baccalaureate</a> degree granting institution. General governance of the institution is provided by the Board of Regents of the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU) was created by an act of the <a>Oklahoma Legislature</a> in 1909 as Pan-Handle Agricultural Institute offering secondary agricultural education for the Panhandle area. In 1921, the legislature authorized the school to offer a two-year college curriculum, and the name was changed to Panhandle Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1967, the school was designated as Oklahoma Panhandle State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. In 1974, the University assumed its present name.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The university is organized into six schools that offer <a>associate degree</a>s and <a>bachelor's degree</a>s in such areas as <a>history</a>, <a>education</a>, <a>business</a>, and <a>nursing</a>. OPSU's <a>agriculture</a>-related degree programs produce valued and competent graduates who are qualified to work in the region's many bovine, equine, swine, and <a>farming</a>-related industries. OPSU is regionally accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools to grant associate and bachelor's degrees. It is also approved by the Oklahoma State Board of Education for the preparation of elementary and secondary teachers. <a>thumb|225px|Primay quad and clock tower at OPSU</a> The constituent schools are:</p>

The university sponsors <a>football</a>, softball (women), baseball (men), and men's and women's <a>golf</a>, cross-country running, and <a>basketball</a>. The football team plays at <a>Carl Wooten Field</a> and competes in the NCAA Division II <a>Independent Football Alliance</a>with several games from the Central State Football League, which is NAIA. The program has recently had tremendous success thanks to the late Mike Wyatt(2007-2011).  The 2010 team was the Aggies football teams first winning season since 2004 going 6-5.</p>
<p>A point of pride for OPSU is its men's and women's <a>rodeo</a> teams, nicknamed the <strong><a>Cowboy</a>s</strong> and <strong><a>Cowgirl</a>s</strong>, respectively. The school is a member of the Central Plains Region of the <a>National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association</a> (NIRA) and has won several regional and national championships in the sport. As part of their scholarship package, rodeo team members may receive lodging in special housing and stalls for their animals.</p>
