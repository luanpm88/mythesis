<p>    The <strong>University of Northern British Columbia</strong> (UNBC) is a small, research-intensive <a>university</a> whose main <a>campus</a> is in <a>Prince George</a>, <a>British Columbia</a>.  UNBC also has regional campuses in the northern British Columbia cities of <a>Prince Rupert</a>, <a>Terrace</a>, <a>Quesnel</a>, and <a>Fort St. John</a>. The enabling legislation is the <em>University Act.</em>   4177 students were enrolled at UNBC in the 2007-2008 academic year. In 2007, the University obtained the <a>trademark</a> for &quot;Canada's Green University&quot;. The university press, The Over the Edge, is a member of the <a>Canadian University Press</a>. Because of its northern latitude, UNBC is a member of the <a>University of the Arctic</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>British Columbia legislature</a> passed Bill 40, (the UNBC Act) that formally established the university, on June 22, 1990 The university was established in response to a grass roots movement spearheaded by the <a>Interior University Society</a>. UNBC offered a limited number of courses in rented office space in 1992 and 1993 but opened officially, for full operation, in 1994 with the completion of the main Prince George campus after two years of construction.</p>
<p>The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a <a>bicameral</a> system of university government consisting of a Senate (composed of members of the faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (composed of members of the community) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The President, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The current President is Dr. George Iwama, whose term as President began July 1, 2009.</p>
<h2>Features and Buildings</h2>
<p>The campus is located on Cranbrook Hill, overlooking the city of Prince George from the west and is widely renowned for its innovative architecture. The separate buildings are linked by an <a>agora</a> that is partially below ground level. It is the efficient heating system connected to all the core campus buildings that permits UNBC to pursue its goal of heating the university by the gasification of clean-burning, renewable wood pellets, collected from the waste of pine trees killed by the mountain pine beetle epidemic.</p>
<p>UNBC's buildings are designed to represent the northern landscape. The 'Winter Garden' area has a flowing blue staircase below a ceiling of wooden lattices, representing the west coast rain forests. The cafeteria has a lighthouse design representative of the North's rugged coastline.  There are also other structures, such as triangular glass peaks, which represent mountains and act as sky-lights for the UNBC Bookstore.</p>
<p>On October 13th 2010, UNBC was co-awarded the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) for its bio-energy project which targets a reduction in fossil fuel use by supplying 85% of UNBC's heating needs. </p>
<h2>Mandate</h2>
<p>UNBC's motto<em> 'En cha hun&#x00e1;</em> literally means &quot;He/she also lives.&quot; in the <a>Nak'azdli</a> (<a>Fort St. James</a>) dialect of <a>Carrier</a>. It is said to be a saying meaning &quot;other people have their point of view&quot; or &quot;respect everyone's point of view&quot;.</p>
