<p><strong>Eberhard Karls University, T&#x00fc;bingen</strong> (, sometimes called the &quot;Eberhardina Carolina&quot;) is a public university located in the city of <a>T&#x00fc;bingen</a>, <a>Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>, <a>Germany</a>. It is one of Germany's oldest universities, internationally noted in <a>medicine</a>, <a>natural science</a>s and the <a>humanities</a>. In the area of <a>German Studies</a> (German: <em>Germanistik</em>) it has been ranked first among all German universities for many years. T&#x00fc;bingen is one of five classical &quot;university towns&quot; in Germany; the other four being <a>Marburg</a>, <a>G&#x00f6;ttingen</a>, <a>Freiburg</a> and <a>Heidelberg</a>. The university is associated with some <a>Nobel laureates</a>, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry.</p>
<p>Currently, around 22,000 students are enrolled. The 17 hospitals in T&#x00fc;bingen affiliated with the university's faculty of medicine have 1,500 patient beds, and cater to 66,000 in-patients and 200,000 out-patients on an annual basis.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> the University of T&#x00fc;bingen was ranked 131st in the world, making it the seventh highest ranked university in Germany. Its subject rankings were: 67th in Arts &amp; Humanities, 86th in Life Sciences &amp; Biomedicine, 170th in Natural Sciences, and 197th in Social Sciences.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The University of T&#x00fc;bingen was founded in 1477 by Count <a>Eberhard V</a> (Eberhard im Bart, 1445&#x2013;1496), later the first Duke of <a>W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>, a civic and ecclesiastic reformer who established the school after becoming absorbed in the <a>Renaissance</a> revival of learning during his travels to <a>Italy</a>. Its first rector was <a>Johannes Nauclerus</a>.</p>
<p>Its present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke <a>Karl Eugen</a> who appended his first name to that of the founder (<em>Karls</em> being the <a>possessive form</a> of <em>Karl</em>). The university later became the principal university of the kingdom of <a>W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>. Today, it is one of nine state universities funded by the German <a>federal state</a> of Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg. <a>thumb|right|The Main Building 'Neue Aula' in July 2007</a> The University of T&#x00fc;bingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in <a>theology</a>, in which the university and the <a>T&#x00fc;binger Stift</a> are famous to this day. <a>Philipp Melanchthon</a> (1497&#x2013;1560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the <a>Protestant Reformation</a>, helped establish its direction. Among T&#x00fc;bingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer <a>Johannes Kepler</a>; the economist Horst K&#x00f6;hler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger, <a>former Cardinal and currently Pope Benedict XVI</a>, poet <a>Friedrich H&#x00f6;lderlin</a>, and the philosophers <a>Friedrich Schelling</a> and <a>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>. &quot;The T&#x00fc;bingen Three&quot; refers to H&#x00f6;lderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the T&#x00fc;binger Stift. Theologian <a>Helmut Thielicke</a> revived postwar Tubingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951.</p>
<p>The university rose to the height of its prominence in the middle of the 19th century with the teachings of poet and civic leader <a>Ludwig Uhland</a> and the Protestant theologian <a>Ferdinand Christian Baur</a>, whose beliefs and disciples became known as the &quot;T&#x00fc;bingen School&quot; and which initiated historical analysis of Biblical texts, an approach also generally referred to as the <a>higher criticism</a>. The University of T&#x00fc;bingen also was the first German university to establish a faculty of <a>natural science</a>s, in 1863. <a>DNA</a> was discovered in 1868 at the University of T&#x00fc;bingen by <a>Friedrich Miescher</a>. <a>Christiane N&#x00fc;sslein-Volhard</a>, the first female Nobel Prize winner in medicine in Germany, also works in T&#x00fc;bingen. The faculty for economics and business was founded in 1817 as 'Staatswissenschaftliche Fakult&#x00e4;t' and was the first of its kind in Germany.</p>
<p>In 1970 the university was restructured into a series of <a>faculties</a> as independent departments of study and research after the manner of <a>French</a> universities.</p>
<p>The university made the headlines in November 2009 when a group of left-leaning students occupied one of the main lecture halls, the Kupferbau, for several days. The students' goal was to protest tuition fees and maintain that education should be free for everyone.</p>
<p>In May 2010 T&#x00fc;bingen joined the <a>Matariki Network of Universities</a> (MNU) together with <a>Dartmouth College</a> (USA), <a>Durham University</a> (UK), <a>Queen&#x2019;s University</a> (Canada), <a>University of Otago</a> (New Zealand), <a>University of Western Australia</a> (Australia) and <a>Uppsala University</a> (Sweden).</p>
<h2>Research focus</h2>
<p>[[Image:ZMBP T&#x00fc;bingen.jpg|right|thumb|The <em>Zentrum f&#x00fc;r Molekularbiologie der Pflanzen</em> (Centre for [[molecular biology]] of plants) of the University of T&#x00fc;bingen is a multidisciplinary (plant physiology, plant biochemistry, plant genetics) plant science research facility, located on the Morgenstelle science campus]] The University of T&#x00fc;bingen undertakes a broad range of research projects in various fields. The most prominent ones are to be found among the natural sciences. The <a>Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research</a>, for instance, focuses on general, cognitive and cellular <a>neurology</a> as well as <a>neurodegeneration</a>. The <a>Centre for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research</a> deals primarily with cell biology in diagnostics and therapy of organ system diseases.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University of T&#x00fc;bingen is not a <a>campus university</a>, but is spread throughout the town. There are four areas with a major concentration of university institutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The university uses a number of buildings in the <strong>old town</strong> of T&#x00fc;bingen, some of which date back to the foundation of the university. Today, these are mainly used by smaller humanities departments, as is the adjacent <a>castle</a>, <a>Schloss Hohent&#x00fc;bingen</a>.</li>
  <li>Northeast of the old town, the <strong>Wilhelmstra&#x00df;e</strong> area surrounding the street of the same name is home to larger humanities departments as well as the university's administration. The main university library and main <a>refectory</a> are also in this area.</li>
  <li>A new campus for the sciences was built in the 1970s at <strong>Morgenstelle</strong>, on a hill north of the historic centre of T&#x00fc;bingen. Facilities include a large refectory.</li>
  <li>The university's <a>teaching hospitals</a> are located between the Wilhelmstra&#x00df;e area and the Morgenstelle campus in an area collectively known as the <strong>Klinikum</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accommodation provided by the T&#x00fc;bingen <a>Studentenwerk</a> is in several locations throughout the town. The largest of the eleven <a>halls of residence</a> are at <a>Waldh&#x00e4;user Ost</a> (1,700 rooms) and in the <a>Franz&#x00f6;sisches Viertel</a> (500 rooms).</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>The university <a>library</a> is not just available to those affiliated with the university, but also to the general public. The library provides more than three million individual volumes and more than 7,600 journals. Apart from the main library, more than 80 departmental libraries containing an additional three million volumes are also associated with the university. <a>right|thumb|The Library</a> The main lending library is located on Wilhelmstra&#x00df;e and consists of several different parts which are connected through corridors and walkways.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Bonatzbau, the library's oldest building, was built in 1912 and currently houses the historical reading room (Historischer Lesesaal), the university <a>archive</a>, along with a number of <a>manuscript</a> collections.</li>
  <li>The library's main building, constructed in 1963, contains the information desk and research stations to access electronic catalogues and databases.</li>
  <li>The Ammerbau is the most recent addition to the library complex. Built in 2002, it offers users direct access to over 300,000 volumes and latest issues of newspapers, magazines and journals. It also contains numerous work places and separate individual rooms for group work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p>The university is made up of 14 faculties, some of which are subdivided into further departments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protestant Theology</li>
  <li>Catholic Theology</li>
  <li>Law</li>
  <li>Economics and Business Administration</li>
  <li>Medicine</li>
  <li><a>Philosophy and History</a></li>
  <li>Social and Behavioral Science</li>
  <li><a>Modern Languages</a></li>
  <li>Cultural Sciences</li>
  <li>Mathematics and Physics</li>
  <li>Chemistry and Pharmacy</li>
  <li>Biology </li>
  <li>Geosciences </li>
  <li>Information and Cognitive Science</li>
</ul>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>The university is governed by three separate bodies sharing with different functions and duties. However, some persons serve in more than one body.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rectorate</strong> is the executive component of the university's governing body. The current <a>rector</a>, Professor <a>Bernd Engler</a>, is supported by four deputies consisting of three <a>prorector</a>s and one <a>provost</a>. All are also permanent members of the university senate.</p>
<p>The <strong>Senate</strong> forms the legislative section of governance. Apart from the members of the rectorate, it includes the <a>equal opportunities</a> commissioner, the deans and 20 elected members representing the professors, lecturers, students and non-academic staff. Two advisors represent the university's <a>teaching hospital</a>s.</p>
<p>The <strong>University Council</strong> (<em>Hochschulrat</em> or <em>Universit&#x00e4;tsrat</em>) has 13 members, including its president and vice-president as well as five further internal and six external members.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>As the university's students make up roughly a quarter of the total population of T&#x00fc;bingen, the town's culture is to a large extent dominated by them. Consequently, there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer, when a large number of otherwise regular events do not take place.</p>
<p>Around 30 <em><a>Studentenverbindung</a>en</em>, the German type of <a>fraternities</a>, are associated with the university. While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly &quot;Stocherkahn-Rennen&quot; punting-boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged <a>rightwing</a> policial views, leading to strong criticism from <a>leftist</a> groups. The university itself takes a neutral stance on this issue.</p>
<p>Also closely linked to the university are a number of <strong>student societies</strong> representing mainly the arts and <a>political parties</a>. Most notable are a number of <a>choir</a>s as well as student <a>theatre</a> groups affiliated with the faculty of Modern Languages, some of which perform in foreign languages. <em>Radio Uniwelle T&#x00fc;bingen</em> is the <a>university's radio station</a>, airing seven hours of programmes a week produced by students under the supervision of staff employed by the university.</p>
<p>The university also offers <a>gym</a> and <a>sport</a>s classes called <em>Hochschulsport</em>. Since T&#x00fc;bingen has a department of <a>sports science</a> with a broad range of facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals. Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as <a>parachuting</a> or <a>martial arts</a>, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at reduced rates. The sports department is located close to the <em>Wilhelmstra&#x00df;e</em> area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.</p>
<p>Unlike in some major cities, <strong>student discounts</strong> are not widely available in T&#x00fc;bingen. <a>Cinema</a>s and the <a>town council</a>'s <a>public library</a> in particular do not offer discounts for students, and there are only a handful of restaurants which have reduced <a>lunch</a> deals. However, students may benefit from the <em>Semesterticket</em>, a heavily discounted <a>public transport</a> season pass offering six months of unlimited travel on trains and buses in the <a>naldo</a> <em>Verkehrsverbund</em> <a>transport association</a> for approximately &#x20ac;50. The <a>Landestheater T&#x00fc;bingen</a> theatre and all public swimming pools also have discounts for students.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong> in T&#x00fc;bingen is centered on the numerous <a>pub</a>s in the old town along with a number of <a>clubs</a>, most of which dedicate themselves to non-<a>mainstream</a> music. During the semester, the <a>Studentenwerk</a>-owned <em>Clubhaus</em> at the centre of the Wilhelmstra&#x00df;e university area hosts the weekly <em>Clubhausfest</em> on Thursday nights. This popular, free-entry club night is organised and promoted by student societies and <em>Fachschaft</em> student representative bodies and all proceeds go towards their activities in support of students.</p>
