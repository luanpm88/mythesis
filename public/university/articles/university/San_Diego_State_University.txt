<p><strong>San Diego State University</strong> (<strong>SDSU</strong>), founded in 1897 as San Diego Normal School, is the largest and oldest higher education facility in the greater San Diego area (generally the <a>City</a> and <a>County</a> of San Diego), and is part of the <a>California State University</a> system. It is the third-oldest university in the California State University system, and one of the oldest universities in California. SDSU has a student body of approximately 29,256 (as of the beginning of the Fall 2009 academic year) and an alumni base of more than 200,000. San Diego State University had an acceptance rate of 31.2 % for the 2008 academic year. According to SDSU's website, the university received 62,000 applications for the 2008 school year. </p>
<p>The <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> has designated San Diego State University a &quot;Research University with high research activity.&quot; SDSU is the only California State University campus with this classification, which places it among the top 200 higher education institutions in the country conducting research.  Notably, pursuant to the <a><em>Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index</em> (FSP Index)</a> released by the Academic Analytics organization of <a>Stony Brook, NY</a>, SDSU is the number one small research university in the United States as of the last four (4) academic years, from 2005-2006 through the 2009-2010 academic years. In 2010, <em><a>The Daily Beast</a></em> ranked SDSU No.21 in its list of &quot;Tech's 29 Most Powerful Colleges.&quot;</p>
<p>San Diego State University awards <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a>, and <a>doctoral</a> degrees (<a>Ph.D.</a>, <a>Ed.D</a>, and <a>Au.D</a>) in a total of 151 fields. SDSU offers the most doctoral degrees of any campus of the California State University system, currently in sixteen academic and research <a>disciplines</a>.</p>
<p>San Diego State University is a member of the <a>American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)</a>, the <a>National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges</a>, the <a>Southwest Border Security Consortium</a>, and the <a>Oak Ridge Associated Universities</a>, a national organization of universities that promotes science and technology education and research.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Established on March 13, 1897 San Diego State University first began as the San Diego Normal School, meant to educate local future female elementary school teachers. In 1923, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, &quot;a four-year public institution controlled by the state Board of Education.&quot;  In 1935 the school became San Diego State College. In 1960, San Diego State College became a part of the California College System, now known as the <a>California State University</a> system. Finally in 1970 San Diego State College became San Diego State University (SDSU).</p>

<p>One in seven San Diegans with a college degree attended SDSU, making SDSU a primary educator of the region's work force. Committed to serving the diverse <a>San Diego</a> region, SDSU ranks among the top ten universities nationwide in terms of ethnic and racial diversity among its student body, as well as the number of bachelor's degrees conferred upon minority students.  University faculty consistently attract hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars annually in grants and contracts for research and program administration, and SDSU's research and graduate degree programs lead all other campuses of the <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
<p>For the beginning of the 2006-2007 academic year, SDSU expanded its classrooms and support space by more than  with the opening of three new buildings, the College of Arts and Letters, the Calpulli Center and BioScience Center. The buildings, respectively, feature high-technology classrooms, upgraded health and wellness facilities, and scientific research laboratories.</p>
<p>SDSU's Astronomy Department owns the <a>Mount Laguna Observatory</a> located in the <a>Cleveland National Forest</a>. It operates the observatory concurrently with the <a>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>
<p><a>John F. Kennedy</a>, then the <a>President of the United States of America</a>, gave the graduation commencement address at San Diego State University on June 6, 1963. </p>

<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> The first major sport on campus was <a>rowing</a>, but it initially had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed early in the campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. From 1925-26, SDSU played as an independent. It then joined the <a>Southern California Conference</a> in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled.</p>
<p>The basketball team reached and won multiple championships games during the 1930-40s, including a conference title in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939. It reached the national championship in 1939 and 1940, losing in the final rounds. However, in 1941 SDSU returned and won the college's first national title.</p>
<p>[[Image:MarshallFaulkSDSUGameBall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marshall Faulk]]'s game ball from the September 14, 1991 game when he ran for a NCAA-record 386 yards and scored 44 points]]</p>
<p>Under Governali, the campus&#x2019;s football program suffered, due to Governali&#x2019;s policy of not recruiting new players. To improve the program, Love hired <a>Don Coryell</a> in 1961, which helped the program to win three consecutive championships (1966&#x2013;68), and end with a record of 104 wins, 19 losses, and 2 ties by the time he left SDSU. Coryell was assisted by <a>John Madden</a>, <a>Joe Gibbs</a>, and <a>Rod Dowhower</a>, among others. In Coryell&#x2019;s first year, attendance at home games averaged 8,000 people, but by 1966 it had doubled to 16,000. This later jumped to 26,000-41,000 per game with the addition of the new San Diego stadium. At some games, attendance was larger than at <a>San Diego Chargers</a> games. There were several undefeated seasons and multiple players broke records for most catches, touchdowns, and passing yards, among others. In 1969, SDSU moved into <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division 1</a>, leaving the <a>California Collegiate Athletic Association</a>. In 1972, Coyrell left to pursue coaching in the NFL.</p>
<p>Basketball also did well, with the 1967-68 team being ranked the number one college-level team in the nation, although it did not win a national title. The Aztecs also won the 1960 CCAA baseball title, and won multiple national championships throughout the 1960s in track, cross country, and swimming.</p>
<p>SDSU competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> FBS. Its primary conference is the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>; its women's <a>water polo</a> team participates in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> and its men's <a>soccer</a> team participates as an Associate Member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> (the &quot;<a>Pac-10</a>&quot; Conference). The ice hockey team competes in the <a>ACHA</a> with other western region club teams (www.sdsuhockey.com). The crew team's championship regatta is in the WIRA (Western International Rowing Association). The university colors are <a>scarlet (red)</a> and <a>black</a>, SDSU's athletic teams are nicknamed &quot;<a>Aztecs</a>&quot;, and its current <a>mascot</a> is the <a>Aztec Warrior</a>, historically referred to as &quot;Monty - Montezuma&quot;.

</ul>
<h3>Clubs</h3>
<p>Initial clubs that were first started on campus including the Debating Club, the Associated Student Body, YWCA, and in 1906, an alumni association. The oldest club on campus was The Rowing Association.</p>
<h3>Student body and Greek life</h3>
<p>The first fraternity on campus was the Delta chapter of Epsilon Eta, which formed on October 25, 1921. By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local, and did not attain national status until after World War II. In 1925, in order to encourage higher grades, the Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorority Council published the average grades of the fraternity and sorority members. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students was 1.49, for fraternities was 1.35, and sororities was 1.47. The first fraternity to go national was <a>Theta Chi</a> and the first sorority was <a>Alpha Xi Delta</a>.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1974, the Phi Beta Kappa honor society established a SDSU chapter. It was the first in the CSU system as well as the San Diego area. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the Greek population had dwindled to 699, but gradually began to increase in the 1980s, reaching 2,900 in 1988. There were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Inter Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Council as well as six independent fraternities/sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S. On April 6, 1978, <a>Gamma Phi Beta</a> sorority hired a plane to drop <a>marshmallow</a>s on fraternity houses during Derby Week, but the plane crashed near Peterson Gym, injuring four students aboard. In 1983 a <em><a>USA Today</a></em> article reported that SDSU Greeks GPAs were below the campus average, so SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above University average. Between 1989-91, several riots among the fraternities occurred, including one numbering 3,500 people, and another requiring 34 police officers to end it. The <a>2008 drug bust</a> resulted in the suspension of several fraternities as well as the arrests of multiple fraternity members. Currently there are over 48 social fraternities and sororities, including both general and culturally based organizations, represented by four governing councils.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>

<h3>S mountain</h3>
<p>&quot;S&quot; mountain was created by the Council of Twelve and initially supported by President Hardy. On February 27, 1931, he allowed 500 students to paint rocks, forming a 400-foot &quot;S&quot; on <a>Cowles Mountain</a>. The giant S was lit at night for the opening football game of a season (performed by the freshman to build school spirit) along with pep rallies, and was repainted throughout its history. At the time, it was the largest collegiate symbol in the world. During World War II, the S was camouflaged to prevent it becoming a reference point for enemy bombing aircraft. It was returned to its normal state in April 1944. In the 1970s students stopped painting it and brush obstructed the symbol. After a 1988 brush fire it was exposed, and students repainted it. In fall, 1997, a group of 100 volunteers climbed Cowles Mountain after dusk to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the school by using flashlights to once again outline the &quot;S&quot; on the side of the mountain. In 1990, a high school prank defaced the S to read as &quot;91&quot; in honor of their graduating class.</p>
<h3>School colors and mascot</h3>
<p>The initial <a>colors of the school</a> were white and gold. When the junior college was added to the campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged together, resulting in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by crimson and black on January 28, 1928.</p>
<p>The school's prior nicknames for its mascot included &quot;Normalites&quot;, &quot;Professors&quot;, and &quot;Wampus Cats&quot;. However, after a 1924 committee met to address the issue, the name &quot;Aztecs&quot; was decided on. In 2003, the Aztec Warrior was approved by a student and alumni vote to become the official university mascot after the school's prior mascot, Monty Montezuma, was discontinued.</p>
<h2>Publications</h2>
<p>Students began publishing <em>The White and Gold</em> in 1902, which was a literary magazine and newspaper. In 1913, a new newspaper was established entitled <em>Normal News Weekly</em>. The school newspaper <em>Paper Lantern</em> (<em>Normal News Weekly</em> was renamed after the addition of the junior college) became <em>The Aztec</em> in September 1925. It was originally reported that 75 of the arrested were students, but the inflated number included students who had been arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession.  The bust, which was the largest in the history of <a>San Diego County</a>, drew a mixed reaction from the community. In addition, Associated Students President, James Poet was arrested on October 17, 2008, for driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. Poet expressed full support for the actions of Operation Sudden Fall and the Zero Tolerance Policy. </p>
<h2>Buildings</h2>
<p> Several buildings are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scripps Cottage was finished in September 1931, funded with a donation of $6,000 from Ellen Browning Scripps matched with $5,000 from the state. It was the headquarters for the Associated Women Students and was used for meetings, women's activities, and served as a lounge. On September 3, 1968 the building was moved to make room for the new library. It was used mainly as a conference and meeting building, and in 1993, began serving as a center for international students.</li>
  <li><a>Aztec Bowl</a>, costing $500,000, the stadium was dedicated on October 3, 1936 before 7,500 people, after being completed earlier that year. The stadium was initially supposed to be expanded to 45,000 seats, but instead was only expanded once with 5,000 seats in 1948. Aztec Bowl was the only state college stadium in California at the time of its construction.</li>
  <li>Open Air Theatre contained 4,280 seats and was financed by the Works Progress Administration and the state for $200,000. It was dedicated in 1941.</li>
  <li>On January 19, 1976, the Montezuma Mesa building was renamed to <a>Walter R.
