<h2>History</h2>
<p>City Tech is one of the oldest institutions in the CUNY system, indirectly tracing its history to 1881 when <a>Voorhees Technical Institute</a> was founded in Manhattan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1882 - The Technical Schools of the <a>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> is renamed the New York Trade School to more precisely reflect its curriculum (after the art education program is moved to a separate school). </li>
  <li>1892 - Financier <a>J. Pierpont Morgan</a> sizably endows the New York Trade School. Over the next 60 years it gains a reputation as the nation&#x2019;s leading trade school for American young men and is the model upon which other trade schools are founded. </li>
  <li>1946 - The New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences is founded in response to the needs of business, industry and the professions for highly trained technicians and other specialists for the post-war economy. It is one of five such institutes created by the New York state legislature, in response to a proposal by Governor <a>Thomas Dewey</a>. Major Benjamin H. Namm, chairman of the board of the Namm-Loesser department store, is appointed to chair the Board of Trustees of the new institute, and Otto Klitgord, formerly the administrator of the <a>National Youth Administration</a> for the NYC Board of Education, becomes the first director of the institute.</li>
  <li>1953 - The institute is renamed <strong>New York City Community College</strong>, becoming the city&#x2019;s first community college. </li>
  <li>1961 - The New York Trade School&#x2019;s charter is amended, making it a &#x201c;technical institute.&#x201d; It is renamed Voorhees Technical Institute in honor of Enders M. Voorhees, a prominent industrialist and chairman of its board of trustees. Its charter now allows the school to grant associate in applied science degrees and to operate as a two-year college. </li>
  <li>1964 - <strong>New York City Community College</strong> is made part of The City University of New York (CUNY). </li>
  <li>1965 - Voorhees Technical Institute first begins accepting female students. </li>
  <li>1971 - Voorhees Technical Institute is incorporated into New York City Community College. </li>
  <li>1980 - <strong>New York City Community College</strong> is designated &#x201c;a technical institute within the CUNY system&quot; and is renamed <strong><em>New York City Technical College</em></strong> (City Tech). It offers 27 career programs. </li>
  <li>1983 - New York City Technical College is authorized to grant its first baccalaureate degree in hotel and restaurant management. </li>
  <li>1996 - City Tech's Graphic Arts Department merges with its Art and Advertising Design Department to form a new Department of Advertising Design and Graphic Arts (ADGA).</li>
  <li>2002 - New York City Technical College is renamed <strong><em>New York City College of Technology</em></strong>, offering 50 career-specific baccalaureate, associate and specialized certificate programs in the technologies of art and design, business, computer systems, engineering, entertainment, health care, hospitality, human services, the law-related professions, career and technology teacher education, and the liberal arts and sciences.</li>
  <li>2004 - Dr. Russell K. Hotzler becomes the eighth president of the College.</li>

<h2>Notable Alumni and Faculty</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a>Frank McCourt</a>, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of <a>Angela's Ashes</a>, taught in the English department. In a 1997 NY Times Op-Ed essay, Mr. McCourt wrote about his experiences teaching immigrant mothers at New York City Technical College during the Spring 1990 semester.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Campus</h2>
<p>NYC College of Technology is located in the heart of <a>Downtown Brooklyn</a>, east of the <a>Brooklyn Bridge</a> and north of the <a>Polytechnic Institute of New York University</a>. The main buildings are the Namm, Atrium, General, and Pearl buildings.  <a>thumb|200px|The Atrium and Pearl buildings</a> <a>thumb|200px|The Namm and Atrium buildings</a></p>
<p>The Namm building houses most of the classrooms and labs for general studies such as Physics, Math, English, etc. Its height is 11 floors, and its address is 300 Jay Street. The ground floor is used by the Registrar and other academic offices.  </p>
<p>The Pearl building houses classrooms and labs for health science, chemistry, and biology. Its height is 6 floors, and its entrance is on Adams Street. </p>
<p>The General Building adjoins Pearl. It is also six floors and houses labs and classrooms for Graphic Arts, open -access computer labs and computer-assisted classrooms and student activities</p>
<p>Atrium connects the Namm building with the Pearl and General Buildings. It houses Graphic Labs, the Library, learning center and some classrooms. At the north end, facing Tillary Street, it has a slanted glass roof. </p>
<p>At 285 Jay Street is the Klitgord Center, which houses sports and recreation activities and the College Auditorium. Klitgord is scheduled to be replaced with a new building, containing a large amount of additional classroom and specialized laboratory space, to house healthcare and science programs, as well as a new gymnasium and theatre facility.  The building will provide the College with an additional , to meet the needs of its rapidly growing student population. Construction is expected to start in 2010.</p>
<p>The Voorhees building, named for the Voorhees Technical Institute which was incorporated into the College in 1971, houses classrooms and labs for technical and engineering majors, such as Electromechanical Engineering, Construction Management, Entertainment Technology, etc. It is located north on Jay Street, very close to the entrance to the <a>Manhattan Bridge</a>.</p>
<h2>City Tech Tower</h2>
<p> <a>150px|right|thumb|The proposed City Tech Tower</a></p>
<p><strong>City Tech Tower</strong> was a <a>supertall</a> <a>skyscraper</a> designed by <a>Renzo Piano</a>, which was proposed to rise at Jay and Tillary Streets in <a>Downtown Brooklyn</a>, <a>New York City</a>, but has since then been substantially changed.</p>
<p>The building would have stood 1,000 feet (305 m) tall and contain 11 floors for the college and 600 units of housing. The building, at a height of 1,000 feet (305 m), would have been the tallest in Brooklyn. The building would have been the first skyscraper in Brooklyn to rise more than 60 stories, since the tallest completed building in the district is only 42 stories tall.</p>
<p>Plans continue for a new academic complex to rise at the corner of Tillary and Jay Streets. The project is expected to produce over  of space for the College and will house many of the science and health care programs, plus a new gymnasium and theater.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Plans for the City Tech tower have been discontinued.</p>
