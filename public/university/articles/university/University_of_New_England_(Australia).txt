<p>The <strong>University of New England</strong> (<strong>UNE</strong>) is an Australian public university with approximately 18,000 higher education students. Its original and main campus is located in the city of <a>Armidale</a> in northern <a>New South Wales</a>.</p>
<p>The University of New England was the first Australian university established outside a capital city.</p>
<p>Each year, the University offers students more than $2.5 million in scholarships, prizes, and bursaries and more than $18 million for staff and students involved in research. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of New England was originally formed in 1938 as the New England University College, a College of the University of Sydney. It became fully independent in 1954.</p>
<p>The University of New England has undergone two major changes since 1989. The University of New England Act, 1989, created a network University consisting of: (i) a campus at Armidale, incorporating the former University of New England and the former Armidale College of Advanced Education; and (ii) a campus at Lismore, incorporating the former Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education. The following year the Orange Agricultural College joined the network University. The network also included the UNE-Coffs Harbour Centre, which provided courses from within academic departments of the Armidale and Lismore campuses. </p>
<p>The University of New England has been re-formed once again, with legislation (The University of New England Act, 1993 and the Southern Cross University Act, 1993) passed by both Houses of the New South Wales Parliament in November, 1993. This legislation had the effect of dismantling the network University. The University of New England from 1994 has only one campus, at Armidale. A new University (<a>Southern Cross University</a>) was created with campuses in <a>Lismore</a> and <a>Coffs Harbour</a>; the Orange campus was amalgamated with the <a>University of Sydney</a>. </p>
<p>The University of New England has, since 1989, included the former Armidale College of Advanced Education, which was amalgamated with the Armidale campus at the time of the creation of the network University. This process of amalgamation was complete by the time of the new legislation in 1993, and the dismantling of the network University had no effect on its status.</p>
<p>The University was notified of plagiarism  issues in November 2006, the university initiated several procedures, systems, and policies in 31 July 2007 to fortify its academic integrity <a>UNE Policies</a> [<a>http://www.une.edu.au/policies/pdf/studentplagiarismandacademicmisconductcou%20%20rseworkpolicy.pdf</a>) UNE New Policy]. </p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>The University of New England is a research lead teaching university with prominent courses such as education, law and medicine on offer. </p>
<p>In research, among many areas, it is particularly active in agricultural science, economics, linguistics and archaeology. The university averages approximately 700 <a>PhD</a> candidates at a given time. </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University of New England is located on several sites in Armidale. The northern campus of the University is five kilometres to the northwest of the city centre, in a rural and bushland setting. Part of this campus includes the original property presented by the late Mr T R Forster to the University of Sydney for the establishment of a University College. This property comprised the old homestead, 'Booloominbah', together with several other buildings and 74 hectares of land. Since the original gift, a number of other generous benefactors have presented properties to the University, whose Armidale site now comprises some 260 hectares. </p>

<p><a>Booloominbah</a> and the Vice-Chancellor's residence <a>Trevenna</a> were both designed by architect <a>John Horbury Hunt</a>. </p>
<p>The Newling campus of the University includes the Newling Centre, home to the New England Conservatorium of Music, and other buildings associated with the former Armidale College of Advanced Education. </p>
<p>The University also possesses a number of rural properties in close proximity to the campus, providing facilities for teaching and research. In addition, there are the 'Tullimba' rural research property at Kingstown and the Douglas McMaster Rural Research Station at Warialda.</p>
<p>The University of New England has one of the most extensive residential college systems in Australia. Around half of UNE&#x2019;s on campus students live in one of the colleges.</p>
<h2>Distance Education</h2>
<p>Since 1955, teaching off-campus students by distance education has been an important part of the University's activities. UNE is now Australia's longest continuous provider of distance education and with more than 15,000 external students, is one of Australia's major providers of awards to off-campus students. </p>
<p>Because UNE has a long history of teaching in this mode, its distance education programs provide extensive support systems to overcome those challenges faced by distance students. </p>
<p>Each subject (unit) requires approximately 15 hours of study per week, with the usual load for distance students being two units per semester. </p>
<p>Over 600 subjects offered by UNE are available by distance education, most via the internet. The University has students all over the world studying by distance education.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>UNE undertakes fundamental and applied research in many disciplines. Its scholars and scientists have established international reputations through their contributions in areas such as rural science, agricultural economics, educational administration, linguistics and archaeology. Collaborative research with other institutions includes projects with the <a>CSIRO</a> and the high profile Cooperative Research Centres. Through its research UNE seeks to assist in the economic, social and cultural advancement of Australia and in the advanced training of undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p>
