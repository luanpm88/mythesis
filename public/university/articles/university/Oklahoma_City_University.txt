<p> <strong>Oklahoma City University</strong>, abbreviated <strong>OCU,<em>  is a <a>coeducational</a>, <a>urban</a>, <a>private university</a> located in the midtown district of <a>Oklahoma City</a>, <a>Oklahoma</a>, offering more than 60 undergraduate majors, 12 graduate degrees, including a <a>JD</a>, <a>MBA</a> and <a>PhD</a> in Nursing, and an Adult Studies Program for working adults to earn a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> or <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree. The university has approximately 2,100 undergraduate students and 1,700 graduate students from 46 states and 49 foreign countries. </em></strong></p>
<p>OCU is the only Oklahoma institution listed in the top tier of the master level university category by <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> magazine's &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; issue. It is currently ranked 23rd among Master's Universities in the West region.  More than 78 percent of faculty hold the terminal degrees in their fields; no classes are taught by graduate assistants.  Student to faculty ratio is 11:1 and the average class size is 17 for freshmen and 13 for upperclassmen.  Although OCU is affiliated with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>, the school accepts students of all religious backgrounds and encourages religious diversity.  A notable fact about OCU is that it counts among its alumni three Miss Americas and more than 30 Miss Oklahoma pageant winners.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1904&ndash;1941</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Gold Star Memorial Building (Law Library), an Oklahoma landmark</a> <a>thumb|right|Meinders School of Business</a> <a>right|thumb|Interior of MSB</a>  The first incarnation of Oklahoma City University was called <strong>Epworth University</strong>, which still stands near Classen SAS High School. Anton Classen was heavily involved with development of early Oklahoma City and advanced the idea of a Methodist university in Oklahoma. Classen managed to generate interest in this idea and in 1901 two branches of the Methodist Church embarked on the establishment of a Methodist university. Construction began in 1902 and classes started in 1904 with enrollment growing by almost 100 students during that first year.</p>
<p>Lack of financial support caused Epworth to close in 1911 but classes began at OCU's second incarnation, <strong>Oklahoma Methodist University</strong>, in Guthrie, only months later.</p>
<p>In 1919, trustees decided to close the Guthrie location and make a fresh start in Oklahoma City with a new institution called <strong>Oklahoma City College</strong>. With funding from the Methodist congregations, new college grounds were planned and built in 1922. The school thrived in its new home and its successful transition was formally acknowledged when OCC changed its name to Oklahoma City University in 1924. Athletics took off as more students enrolled, but with the onset of the Great Depression OCU faced great financial strain.</p>
<h3>1942&ndash;1960</h3>
<p>Dr. Cluster Smith assumed the presidency after the <a>Great Depression</a> and began to tackle new challenges emerged - namely, <a>World War II</a> and stemming problems. As the country entered the war, OCU was deeply in debt and needed new facilities. Faculty members were paid late more often than not and a number of trustees personally signed for loans so that salaries could be paid. Male students abandoned their studies to join the military and in 1942, about 75 percent of the student body was women. A shortage of players and funds caused many of the athletic programs to shut down, including the beloved football team.</p>
<p>The end of the war in 1945 brought about an unprecedented surge in enrollment. As a result, there was an extraordinary amount of development through the remainder of the 40's. Construction on a particularly special addition, the Gold Star Building, which memorialized the Americans felled by World War II, began in 1949.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, OCU earned accreditation from the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a>. It also absorbed the Oklahoma City College of Law and embarked upon the Great Plan, a partnership with the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> designed to elevate the academic discourse and thereby deepen the quality of education offered to all students.</p>
<h3>1960&ndash;1979</h3>
<p>The Great Plan was a great success; inspiring positive changes across campus and interdisciplinary approaches at all levels. Departments worked together to create courses that approached lofty topics from a variety of perspectives and taught students to look at life in a new way. OCU's spiritual life was also under construction and the Bishop W. Angie Smith Chapel was dedicated in 1968.</p>
<p><a>Jane Jayroe</a> had become OCU's first student to earn the title of <a>Miss America</a> and programs across campus were thriving. Financial troubles were softened by the excitement of the times but unfortunately could no longer be ignored. By 1976, the financial situation had escalated, sending waves of worry across campus and around town. A long list of drastic measures was put together in an effort to save the school.</p>
<p>Bishop Paul Milhouse held firmly to his faith and aired the school's woes to the Annual Conference of Oklahoma Methodist churches in <a>Tulsa</a>, requesting that people direct their prayers and pledges to the University. The conference attendees responded with $200,000 and the spirit of giving trickled down into individual congregations. Pledges poured in from all over the state and by 1980, the <a>Methodist Church</a> had raised more than $3 million. Morale improved, as did enrollment.</p>
<h3>1979&ndash;1997</h3>
<p>A crisis had been narrowly averted, but OCU remained in a precarious position. Jerald Walker, an OCU alumnus became president in 1979. Walker restored the climate of prosperity and placidity to OCU in record time. Quickly, he made a series of changes that were engineered for maximum impact. Facilities were improved, new programs were offered and students were aggressively recruited. By the summer of 1981, President Walker proudly announced that OCU was not only debt free, but that it had turned a profit for the first time since 1975.</p>
<p>Out of crisis mode, OCU finally had the opportunity to spread its wings. During the 80's, Law students moved into their new home, <a>Susan Powell</a> became the school's second Miss America, the school of religion joined the campus and a new nursing program was launched. The Oklahoma Opera and Music Theater Company was founded in 1982 and programs expanding OCU's international presence were established.</p>
<h3>1998&ndash;present</h3>
<p>At the turn of the century, Oklahoma City University was ready to usher in some of the best years the university had ever known. The campus received a dramatic face-lift, new community partnerships were forged, and the university's mission to prepare students to be servant leaders was the guiding spirit behind it all.</p>
<p>Stephen Jennings became the university's new leader in 1998 focusing on keeping the university in tip-top shape for its 100th birthday. Jennings oversaw the transformation from the Chiefs to the Stars and launched the Distinguished Speakers Series.</p>
<p>A few years later, in 2001, Tom McDaniel became president and his leadership has transformed the university. The most obvious change, of course, has been the drastically altered face of campus, which has benefited from an influx of donations. The Ann Lacy Visitor and Admissions Center, the Norick Art Center, and the Edith Kinney Gaylord Center - not to mention the business school, music center and the new residence hall - have given the campus an architectural update and offer students more academic space and amenities. </p>
<p>On December 10, 2009, OCU announced that <a>Robert Harlan Henry</a>, chief judge of the <a>United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a>, will become the university's 17th president in July 2010, succeeding Tom McDaniel.</p>
