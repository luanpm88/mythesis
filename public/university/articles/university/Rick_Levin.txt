He is currently the longest-tenured <a>Ivy League president</a>. Levin had been rumored as a possible replacement for <a>Larry Summers</a> as Director of the <a>White House</a> <a>National Economic Council</a> until <a>Gene Sperling</a> was selected instead.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Born in <a>San Francisco, California</a>, to <a>Jewish-American</a> parents, Levin graduated from <a>Lowell High School</a> in San Francisco in 1964. At Lowell, he was a member of the <a>Lowell Forensic Society</a> and debated in high school debate tournaments regionally. He graduated from <a>Stanford University</a> in 1968 with a <a>B.A.</a> in <a>history</a>. He received a <a>Bachelor of Letters</a> in <a>politics</a> and <a>philosophy</a> from <a>Merton College</a>,<a>Oxford</a>. He earned his <a>Ph.D.</a> in economics from Yale in 1974. His academic specialties include industrial research and development, intellectual property, and productivity in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Levin became an Assistant Professor of Economics at Yale in 1974 and was elevated to Associate Professor in 1979. In 1982, he was promoted to Professor of Economics and Management at the <a>Yale School of Management</a>. In 1992, he was appointed <a>Frederick William Beinecke</a> Professor of Economics. Before becoming president, he served as chairman of the Economics Department and dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2004, Levin was appointed to the <a>Iraq Intelligence Commission</a>, an independent panel convened to investigate U.S. intelligence surrounding the <a>United States</a>' <a>2003 invasion of Iraq</a> and Iraq's <a>weapons of mass destruction</a>. He had previously served on a government panel reviewing the U.S. Postal Service and an independent panel appointed by Major League Baseball to examine the sport's economics. Levin is a director of the <a>William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>, <a>American Express</a>, and <a>Satmetrix</a>.</p>
<p>Although described in <a>Who's Who</a> as a Democrat, Levin was one of the first guests of President <a>George W. Bush</a> in the White House during his first term and the president stayed at Levin's house when he received an honorary degree from Yale in 2001. </p>

<h3>Yale under Levin</h3>
<p>Since Levin's appointment, all of his provosts have gone on to head other universities: <a>Judith Rodin</a> (appointed by his predecessor) as president of the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>, becoming the first female president of an <a>Ivy League</a> university, <a>Alison Richard</a> as vice-chancellor of the <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>Susan Hockfield</a> as president of the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, and <a>Andrew D. Hamilton</a> as vice-chancellor of the <a>University of Oxford</a>. Other Levin appointees who have left to head other universities include <a>Richard Brodhead</a>, a former dean of <a>Yale College</a>, who left to become the president of <a>Duke University</a>, and Rebecca Chopp, a former dean of the Yale Divinity School, who left Yale to take the helm of <a>Colgate University</a> and is currently president of <a>Swarthmore College</a>.</p>
<p>Levin has been praised during his tenure for an unparalleled expansion of the University's endowment and for overseeing an ambitious renovation plan. Yale's admissions standards and academic prestige have recovered from a significant lull in the early 1990s since Levin's appointment. Applications to Yale College rose from fewer than 11,000 for the class entering in 1993 to over 26,000 for the class entering in 2009, with the most recent classes reporting the highest range of standardized test scores for any college in America. Under Levin's leadership, Yale has been transforming itself into a truly global university, with a new flagship program for undergraduates in Beijing and a dramatic increase in international work/study programs. Closer to home, Levin's administration in 2003 negotiated unprecedented eight-year contracts with the <a>university's unionized workers</a> that provided free health care, extensive paid leave, and cumulative raises ranging from 32% to 43%, although he has also fought strongly against new unionization drives by hospital workers, <a>graduate employees</a>, and security guards. Levin has made it a point to expand Yale's engagement with <a>China</a> as was elected to the board of the <a>National Committee on United States-China Relations</a>.</p>
