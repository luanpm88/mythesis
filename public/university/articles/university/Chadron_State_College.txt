<h3>2006 Spotted Tail wildfire</h3>

By July 28, the wildfire, fueled by dry grass and winds, reached the edge of Chadron and the college campus. Fire crews prevented the wildfire from reaching the campus. The pine ridge escarpment south of the college, including C-Hill, was blackened as a result of the fire.</p>
