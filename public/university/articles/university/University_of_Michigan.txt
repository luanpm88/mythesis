<p>  The <strong>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Michigan</strong>, <strong>U-M</strong>, <strong>UMich</strong>, or <strong>U of M</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in the <a>state</a> of <a>Michigan</a> in the <a>United States</a>. What would become the university moved to <a>Ann Arbor</a> in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university has physically expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 31 million gross square feet (712&nbsp;acres or 2.38&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), During the 20th century and early 2000s, U-M was the site of much <a>student activism</a>. When presidential candidate <a>John F. Kennedy</a> visited the University on October 14, 1960, he gave an impromptu speech on the steps of the <a>Michigan Union</a> that led to a University of Michigan student movement which contributed to the establishment of the <a>Peace Corps</a>. The University was also a focal point in the controversy over <a>affirmative action</a> within higher education admissions.</p>
<p>In the 2011 <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> &quot;National University Rankings&quot;, the university was ranked 29th among national universities in the United States. In 1995, the <a>National Research Council</a> ranked Michigan <a>third nationally</a> for the quality of its graduate programs. Michigan has one of the world's largest living alumni groups at 460,000 in 2007. U-M owns the <a>University of Michigan Health System</a> and has one of the largest research expenditures of any American university, passing the $1.14 billion dollar mark during the 2009-2010 academic year. <a>James Burrill Angell</a>, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, aggressively expanded U-M's curriculum to include professional studies in <a>dentistry</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>government</a>, and <a>medicine</a>. U-M also became the first American university to use the <a>seminar</a> method of study.</p>
<p>From 1900 to 1920 the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, <a>Hill Auditorium</a>, large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls. In 1920 the university reorganized the <a>College of Engineering</a> and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives. The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the <a>Ivy League</a> schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted. As a result, U-M gained the nickname &quot;Harvard of the West,&quot; which became commonly parodied in reverse after <a>John F. Kennedy</a> referred to himself as &quot;a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University&quot; in his speech proposing the formation of the <a>Peace Corps</a> while on the front steps of the Michigan Union.  During <a>World War II</a>, U-M's research grew to include <a>U.S. Navy</a> projects such as <a>proximity fuze</a>s, <a>PT boat</a>s, and <a>radar jamming</a>. </p>
<p>By 1950, enrollment had reached 21,000, of whom more than one third: 7,700 were veterans supported by the <a>G.I. Bill</a>. As the <a>Cold War</a> and the <a>Space Race</a> took hold, U-M became a major recipient of government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for <a>nuclear energy</a>. Much of that work, as well as research into alternative energy sources, is pursued via the Memorial Phoenix Project.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Central Campus Diag, viewed from the Graduate Library, looking North|alt=Red brick plaza, surrounded by trees with green leaves, with two white tents and an American flag flying from a flagpole in the center</a> <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a>'s speech outlining his <a>Great Society</a> program also occurred at U-M. In response to a series of <a>sit-in</a>s in 1966 by <em>Voice</em>&#x2013;the campus political party of <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students had a one-hour sit-in the LSA Building, which housed administrative offices. </p>
<p>Former U-M student and noted architect <a>Alden B. Dow</a> designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety, but the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and fortress-like exterior led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof. Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, severe budget constraints challenged the university's physical development; but, in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. The university's involvement in the anti-missile <a>Strategic Defense Initiative</a> and investments in <a>South Africa</a> caused controversy on campus. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, U-M also faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping <a>tuition</a> costs affordable. There were disputes between U-M's administration and labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees. These conflicts led to a series of one-day walkouts by the unions and their supporters. The university is currently engaged in a $2.5 billion construction campaign. </p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Law Library Interior|alt=Law Library</a> In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's <a>affirmative action</a> admissions policy reached the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> (<em><a>Grutter v. Bollinger</a></em> and <em><a>Gratz v. Bollinger</a></em>). President <a>George W. Bush</a> took the unusual step of publicly opposing the policy before the court issued a ruling. The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding. But, it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the <a>Law School</a> admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy. </p>
<p>The debate continues because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed <a>Proposal 2</a>, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions. U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the passed proposal soon after that election, and this has allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the election results. The university has stated it plans to continue to challenge the ruling; in the meantime, the admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents. The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the <a>Huron River</a>. There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.</p>
<p>In addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course called &quot;Radrick Farms Golf Course&quot; on Geddes Road. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff, and alumni. Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a 10,000 square foot (930&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the board of regents, and to host visiting dignitaries. The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the <a>Matthaei Botanical Gardens</a>, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>All four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central Campuses. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central Campuses, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.</p>
<h3>Central Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Hill Auditorium and Burton Tower|alt=Red brick building with white stone facade. A tall white-colored stone clock tower with a green roof is in the background</a> Central Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street.</p>
<h3>North Campus</h3>
<p>North Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farm land&#x2014;approximately 800&nbsp;acres (3.25&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)&#x2014;that the university bought in 1952. It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more <a>modern architecture</a>, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or gothic in style. The architect <a>Eero Saarinen</a>, based in <a>Birmingham, Michigan</a>, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building. North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand <a>carillon</a>. The North Campus tower is called <a>Lurie Tower</a>. The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is located on North Campus.</p>
<p>North Campus houses the <a>College of Engineering</a>, the <a>School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance</a>, the <a>School of Art &amp; Design</a>, the <a>Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning</a>, and an annex of the School of Information. The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple <a>computer lab</a>s, <a>video editing</a> studios, and a <a>3D</a> <a>virtual reality</a> room. Other libraries located on North Campus include the <a>Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library</a> and the <a>Bentley Historical Library</a>.</p>
<h3>South Campus</h3>
<p>South Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as <a>Michigan Stadium</a>, <a>Crisler Arena</a>, and <a>Yost Ice Arena</a>. South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility (the collections of which are undergoing digitization by Google), the Institute for Continuing Legal Education, and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups. The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.</p>
<p>U-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena. It was designed in the late 1920s by <a>Alister MacKenzie</a>, the designer of <a>Augusta National Golf Club</a> in <a>Augusta, Georgia</a> (home of The <a>Masters Tournament</a>). The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> calls &#x201c;golf&#x2019;s greatest course architect.&#x201d; The U-M Golf Course&#x2019;s signature No. 6 hole&#x2014;a  par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers&#x2014;is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion <a>Nick Faldo</a> and golf course architect <a>Tom Doak</a>. The listing of &#x201c;the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie&#x201d; is featured in SI&#x2019;s Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>  The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in <a>Dearborn</a> and <a>Flint</a>. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight year terms. Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.</p>
<p>The President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the <a>Michigan Constitution</a> of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote. Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, one of the university's oldest buildings located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor. <a>Mary Sue Coleman</a> is the 13th president of the university and has served since August 2002. Her total compensation for 2008&#x2013;2009 totaled $783,850.</p>
<p>There are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges. By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the <a>College of Literature, Science, and the Arts</a>, the <a>College of Engineering</a>, and the <a>Ross School of Business</a>. At the graduate level, the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university. There are eighteen graduate schools and colleges, the largest of which are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, the Law School, and the Ross School of Business. <a>Professional degrees</a> are conferred by the Schools of Public Health, <a>Dentistry</a>, Law, <a>Medicine</a>, and Pharmacy. It was the <a>seventh largest</a> endowment in the U.S. and the third-largest among U.S public universities at that time, as well as the <a>fastest growing</a> endowment in the nation over the last 21 years. The endowment is primarily used according to the donors' wishes, which include the support of teaching and research. In mid-2000, U-M embarked on a massive fund-raising campaign called &quot;The Michigan Difference,&quot; which aimed to raise $2.5 billion, with $800 million designated for the permanent endowment. Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007. Ultimately, the campaign raised $3.2 billion over 8 years. Over the course of the capital campaign, 191 additional professorships were endowed, bringing the university total to 471 as of 2009. Like nearly all colleges and universities, U-M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008. In February 2009, a university spokesperson estimated losses of between 20 and 30 percent. As of June 2010, the endowment was estimated to be $6.7 billion.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Central Campus: Angell Hall, one of the major buildings of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|alt=White-colored stone building with columns in the center of the facade</a> Housed in the Michigan Union, the <a>Michigan Student Assembly</a> (MSA) is the central student government of the University. With representatives from each of the University's colleges and schools, the MSA represents students and manages student funds on the campus. In recent years MSA has organized airBus, a transportation service between campus and the <a>Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout. MSA has also been successful at reviving <a>Homecoming</a> activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007.</p>
<p>There are student governance bodies in each college and school. The two largest colleges at the University of Michigan are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&amp;A) and the <a>College of Engineering</a>. Undergraduate students in the LS&amp;A are represented by the LS&amp;A Student Government (LSA SG). The University of Michigan Engineering Council (UMEC) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG). In addition, the students that live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association.</p>
<p>A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body. Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the state-wide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett. Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> The University of Michigan is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>. The four year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has &quot;very high&quot; research activity and the &quot;comprehensive&quot; graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and <a>STEM fields</a> as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry. With over 200 undergraduate majors, 100 doctoral and 90 master's programs, U-M conferred 6,473 undergraduate degrees, 4,322 graduate degrees, and 734 first professional degrees in 2008-2009.</p>
<p>National honor societies such as <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, <a>Phi Kappa Phi</a>, and <a>Tau Beta Pi</a> have chapters at U-M. Degrees &quot;with Highest Distinction&quot; are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, &quot;with High Distinction&quot; to the next 7%, and &quot;with Distinction&quot; to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree &quot;with Highest Honors,&quot; &quot;with High Honors,&quot; or &quot;with Honors.&quot; U-M provides financial aid in the form of need-based loans, grants, scholarships, work study, and non-need based scholarships, with 77% of undergraduates in 2007 receiving financial aid. 8% were eligible for <a>Pell Grant</a>s. For undergraduates in 2008, 46% graduated with about $25,586 of debt in 2008.</p>
<h3>Student body profile</h3>
<p>The university has 26,208 <a>undergraduate</a> and 15,466 <a>graduate student</a>s in 600 academic programs, and each year about 5,400 new students are enrolled out of almost 30,000 applicants, of which almost 42% are admitted. Students come from all 50 <a>U.S. state</a>s and more than 100 countries. 97% of the university's incoming class of 2009 earned a high school GPA of 3.0 and higher, while the middle 50% of the incoming class earned a high school GPA of 3.60 to 3.90. Among full-time students, who make up about 96% of the student body, the university has a first-time student retention rate of 96%.</p>
<p> About 65% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the <a>College of Literature, Science, and the Arts</a> (LS&amp;A), while the <a>College of Engineering</a> has about 20%. Fewer than 3% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the <a>Ross School of Business</a>. The rest of the undergraduate students are enrolled in the smaller schools, including the School of Kinesiology, <a>School of Nursing</a>, the <a>School of Natural Resources and Environment</a>, and the <a>School of Art and Design</a>. the university manages one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university in the United States, totaling about $1 billion in 2009. The Medical School spent the most at over US $445 million, while the <a>College of Engineering</a> was second at more than $160 million.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Biomedical Science Research Building at the U-M Medical School|alt=Building with curving bluish-green glass facade behind a road intersection</a> The university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the <a>EKG</a>, <a>gastroscope</a>, and the announcement of <a>Jonas Salk</a>'s polio vaccine. The university's  <a>biological station</a> in the <a>Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan</a> is one of only 47 <a>Biosphere Reserves</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In the mid-1960s U-M researchers worked with <a>IBM</a> to develop a new <a>virtual memory</a> architectural model that became part of <a>IBM's Model 360/67</a> <a>mainframe computer</a> (the 360/67 was initially dubbed the 360/65M where the &quot;M&quot; stood for Michigan). The <a>Michigan Terminal System</a> (<a>MTS</a>), an early <a>time-sharing</a> computer <a>operating system</a> developed at U-M, was the first system outside of IBM to use the 360/67's virtual memory features. In the late 1960s U-M, together with <a>Michigan State University</a> and <a>Wayne State University</a>, founded the <a>Merit Network</a>, one of the first university computer networks. The Merit Network was then and remains today administratively hosted by U-M. Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners <a>IBM</a>, <a>MCI</a>, and the <a>State of Michigan</a> won a national competition to upgrade and expand the <a>National Science Foundation Network</a> (<a>NSFNET</a>) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second. <a>NSFNET</a> was the precursor to today's <a>Internet</a>. </p>
<p>In 2006, U-M joined with <a>Michigan State University</a> and <a>Wayne State University</a> to create the <a>University Research Corridor</a>. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive the transformation of Michigan's economy. The 3 universities are electronically connected via Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR, pronounced 'MY-lar'). Initially MiLR enabled researchers at MSU, U-M and WSU to transfer data at 10 billion bits per second or 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than the Internet connections normally used in homes and businesses today. The speed and reliability of the new network will enable doctors to perform virtual surgery at remote locations. The network provides the capacity for physicists to share exceptionally large data sets with their colleagues around the world. The new network also will serve as a test-bed for experimental research on networking itself. MiLR, which employs advanced optical electronics, will use more than  of fiber-optic cabling, most of it already in place, to connect the universities to each other and to national and international networking hubs in Chicago. Those hubs include the National LambdaRail, StarLight, and an emerging set of network connections that play key roles in the national cyberinfrastructure supporting advanced science and research.</p>
<p>U-M is home to the <a>National Election Studies</a> and the <a>University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index</a>. The <a>Correlates of War</a> project, also located at U-M, is an accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. The university is also home to major research centers in <a>optics</a>, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, <a>wireless integrated microsystems</a>, and social sciences. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Life Sciences Institute are located at the university. The Institute for Social Research (ISR), the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, is home to the Survey Research Center, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Center for Political Studies, Population Studies Center, and Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research. Undergraduate students are able to participate in various research projects through the <a>Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a> (UROP) as well as the UROP/Creative-Programs.</p>
<p>The <a>U-M library system</a> comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collections&#x2014;roughly 9.6 million volumes, growing at the rate of 177,000 volumes a year. U-M was the original home of the <a>JSTOR</a> database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and  has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with <a>Google</a>. The <a>University of Michigan Press</a> is also a part of the U-M library system.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall|alt=Red brick facade with white stone fronts and angled roof</a> The University of Michigan's campus housing system can accommodate up to 10,900 people, or nearly 30 percent of the total student population at the university. The residence halls are organized into three distinct groups: Central Campus, Hill Area (between Central Campus and the University of Michigan Medical Center) and North Campus. Family housing is located on North Campus and mainly serves graduate students. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,240 students, while the smallest accommodates 25 residents. A majority of upper-division and graduate students live in off-campus apartments, houses, and <a>cooperatives</a>, with the largest concentrations in the Central and South Campus areas.</p>
<p>The residential system has a number of &quot;living-learning communities&quot; where academic activities and residential life are combined. These communities focus on areas such as research through the Michigan Research Community, medical sciences, <a>community service</a> and the <a>German language</a>. The Michigan Research Community and the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program are housed in Mosher-Jordan Hall. The Residential College (RC), a living-learning community that is a division of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, also has its principal instructional space in East Quad. The health sciences scholars program (HSSP) is located in Alice Lloyd Hall. In fall 2010, North Quad - the first new residential hall to be built on campus since 1967 - opened. This residence complex is composed of two additional living-learning communities: the <a>Global Scholars Program</a> and the <a>Max Kade German Program</a>. It is &quot;technology-rich,&quot; and houses communication-related programs, including the School of Information, the Department of Communication Studies, and the Department of Screen Arts and Cultures.</p>
<h3>Groups and activities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Michigan Union on Central Campus|alt=Red brick building with large windows, tall central tower, and green ivy growing on the facade</a> There are more than 1269 student clubs and organizations at the university. With a history of student activism, some of the most visible groups include those dedicated to causes such as <a>civil rights</a> and <a>labor rights</a>. One group is <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, which recently reformed with a new chapter on campus as of February 2007, the <a>Weather Underground</a>. Though the student body generally leans toward <a>left-wing politics</a>, there are also conservative groups, such as <a>YAF</a>, non-partisan groups such as the Roosevelt Institution. There are also several engineering projects teams, including the <a>University of Michigan Solar Car Team</a>, which placed first in the <a>North American Solar Challenge</a> five times and third in the <a>World Solar Challenge</a> three times. <a>Michigan Interactive Investments</a>, the <a>TAMID Israel Investment Group</a>, and the Michigan Economics Society are also affiliated with the university.</p>
<p>The university also showcases many community service organizations and charitable projects, including <a>Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children</a>, Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan, <a>The Detroit Partnership</a>, <a>Relay For Life</a>, U-M Stars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, InnoWorks at the University of Michigan, SERVE, Letters to Success, PROVIDES, Circle K, <a>Habitat for Humanity</a>, and Ann Arbor Reaching Out. <a>Intramural sports</a> are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.</p>
<p><a>Fraternities and sororities</a> play a role in the university's social life. A large percentage of the students involved in the University of Michigan Greek Life are from out of state. U-M is home to four different councils making up the majority of fraternities and sororites on campus. These are: the Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Association. Approximately 18% of the undergraduates at the university are involved in Greek Life. Membership numbers for the 2009-2010 school year reached the highest in the last two decades. Each of these councils has a different recruitment process.</p>
<p>The <a>Michigan Union</a> and Michigan League are student activity centers located on Central Campus; Pierpont Commons is on North Campus. The Michigan Union houses a majority of student groups, including the student government. The William Monroe Trotter House, located east of Central Campus, is a multicultural student center operated by the university's Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs. The University Activities Center (UAC) is a student-run programming organization and is composed of 14 committees. Each group involves students in the planning and execution of a variety of events both on and off campus.</p>
<p>The <a>Michigan Marching Band</a>, composed of over 350 students from almost all of U-M's schools, is the university's <a>marching band</a>. Over 100 years old, the band performs at every home football game and travels to at least one away game a year.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> [[File:MichiganStadium2010UConn.JPG|thumb|A football game at [[Michigan Stadium]]|alt=Crowded stadium with yellow-colored &quot;Michigan&quot; written on a green field]] The University of Michigan's sports teams are called the <a>Wolverines</a>. They participate in the <a>NCAA's</a> Football Bowl Subdivision (formally <a>Division I-A</a>) and in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> in all sports except men's <a>ice hockey</a>, which is a member of the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>, and woman's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association. In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a>, a ranking compiled by the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a> to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports. U-M has finished in the top ten of the Directors' Cup standings in 14 of the award's sixteen seasons and has placed in the top six in 9 of the last 10 seasons.</p>
<p>The <a>Michigan football</a> program ranks first in NCAA history in both total wins (884) and winning percentage (.740). The team won the first <a>Rose Bowl</a> game in 1902. U-M had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive <a>bowl game</a> appearances from 1975 to 2007. The Wolverines have won a record 42 Big Ten championships, including five in the past decade. The program has eleven <a>national championships</a>, most recently in 1997, and has produced three <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winners: <a>Tom Harmon</a>, <a>Desmond Howard</a> and <a>Charles Woodson</a>.</p>
<p><a>Michigan Stadium</a> is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of more than 109,901 (the extra seat is said to be &quot;reserved&quot; for <a>Fielding H. Yost</a>) though attendance&#x2014;frequently over 111,000 spectators&#x2014;regularly exceeds the official capacity. The NCAA's record-breaking attendance has become commonplace at Michigan Stadium, especially since the arrival of head coach <a>Bo Schembechler</a>. U-M has fierce rivalries with many teams, including <a>Michigan State</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, and <a>Ohio State</a>, the last of which has been referred to by <a>ESPN</a> as the <a>greatest rivalry</a> in American sports. U-M has all-time winning records against Michigan State University, University of Notre Dame, and Ohio State University.</p>
<p>The men's <a>ice hockey</a> team, which plays at <a>Yost Ice Arena</a>, has won nine <a>national championships</a>, while the <a>men's basketball</a> team, which plays at <a>Crisler Arena</a>, has appeared in four <a>Final Fours</a> and won a <a>national championship</a> in 1989. However, the program became involved in a <a>scandal involving payments from a booster</a> during the 1990s. This led to the program being placed on probation for a four-year period. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992&#x2013;1993 and 1995&#x2013;1999 seasons in which the payments took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.</p>
<p>Through the <a>2008 Summer Olympic Games</a>, 178 U-M students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in every <a>Summer Olympics</a> except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. U-M students have won a total of <a>133 Olympic medals</a>: 65 gold, 30 silver, and 38 bronze. &lt;!--Needs citation: U-M is the only school in the U.S. to have won Division I National Championships in football, baseball, basketball, and hockey.--&gt;</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>The University of Michigan's <a>fight song</a>, <em><a>The Victors</a></em>, was written by student <a>Louis Elbel</a> in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the <a>University of Chicago</a> that won a league championship. The song was declared by <a>John Philip Sousa</a> as &quot;the greatest college fight song ever written.&quot; The song refers to the university as being &quot;the Champions of the West.&quot; At the time, U-M was part of the &quot;Western Conference&quot;, which would later become the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory. Although mainly used at sporting events, the fight song can be heard at other events. President <a>Gerald Ford</a> had it played by the <a>United States Marine Band</a> as his entrance anthem in preference over the more traditional <em>Hail to the Chief</em> during his term from 1974 to 1977, and the <a>Michigan Marching Band</a> performed a slow-tempo variation on the fight song at his funeral. The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's <a>alma mater</a> song is <em><a>The Yellow and Blue</a></em>. A common rally cry is &quot;Let's Go Blue!&quot;, written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a <a>drum major</a>.</p>
<h2>Notable people and alumni</h2>
<p> In addition to the late <a>U.S. president</a> <a>Gerald Ford</a>, the university has produced twenty-six <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, numerous Marshall Scholars, seven <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners, 116 <a>Olympic medalist</a>s, U-M's contributions to aeronautics include aircraft designer <a>Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson</a> of <a>Lockheed</a> <a>Skunk Works</a> fame, Lockheed president <a>Willis Hawkins</a>, and several astronauts including the all-U-M crew of <a>Gemini 4</a> and the all-Michigan crew of <a>Apollo 15</a>. U-M counts among its matriculants <a>seventeen billionaires</a> and prominent company founders and co-founders including <a>Google</a> co-founder <a>Larry Page</a> and <a>Dr. J. Robert Beyster</a> who founded <a>Science Applications International Corporation</a> (SAIC) in 1969.</li>

Conservative pundit <a>Ann Coulter</a> attended law school at U-M, as did <a>Clarence Darrow</a> at a time when many lawyers did not receive any formal education. <a>Vaughn R. Walker</a>, who is a Federal District Judge in California and overturned the controversial <a>California Proposition 8</a> in 2010 and ruled it unconstitutional, received his undergraduate degree from U-M in 1966. Pop Superstar <a>Madonna</a> and rock legend <a>Iggy Pop</a> attended but did not graduate.</p>
<p>Some more notorious graduates of the University are 1910 convicted murderer (though perhaps wrongfully so) Dr. <a>Harvey Crippen</a>, late 19th-century American serial killer <a>Herman Mudgett</a>, and &quot;Unabomber&quot; <a>Ted Kaczynski</a>.</p>
<p>U-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the <a>National Football League</a> and <a>National Basketball Association</a> as well as other professional sports. Notable among recent players is <a>Tom Brady</a> of the <a>New England Patriots</a>. <a>NHL</a> players <a>Marty Turco</a>, <a>Chris Summers</a>, <a>Brendan Morrison</a>, and <a>Michael Cammalleri</a> all played for U-M's ice hockey team. <a>Barry Larkin</a> of the Cincinnati Reds played baseball at the university. <a>Derek Jeter</a> received a baseball scholarship to U-M, but was signed and called up by the New York Yankees before he could play there.</p>
