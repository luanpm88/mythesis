<p>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The <strong>University of Mary Washington</strong> (also known as <strong>UMW</strong>, <strong>Mary Washington</strong>, or <strong>Mary Wash</strong>) is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducational</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in the city of <a>Fredericksburg</a>, <a>Virginia</a>, <a>USA</a>. Founded in 1908, it is one of the oldest universities in <a>Northern Virginia</a>.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Umw-bell-tower.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Carmen Culpeper Chappell '59 Centennial Campanile was completed in May 2007 as part of the university's [[Centennial]] celebration.]] --&gt;</p>
<p>On March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor <a>Claude A. Swanson</a> signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State <a>Normal</a> and Industrial School for Women. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after <a>Mary Ball Washington</a>, mother of the first president of the <a>United States of America</a>, <a>George Washington</a> and long time resident of Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>In 1944 the college became associated with the <a>University of Virginia</a> as its <a>women's college</a>. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as <a>undergraduate</a>s, except in professional schools.  Following the university's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution. Today the university is the only public, coeducational college in the United States named after a secular woman.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004. The institution sought university status to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and increasing enrollment at its College of Graduate and Professional Studies, formerly the James Monroe Center for Graduate and Professional Studies, located in nearby Stafford County. Students can earn an <a>MBA</a>, <a>M.Ed.</a>, MSMIS, MBA-MSMIS <a>dual degree</a>, <a>BPS</a> or other <a>graduate certificate</a>s or professional certifications at the campus. The Carnegie Foundation reclassified the college to university status based on its graduate programs.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2006, Dr. William Anderson retired after 23&nbsp;years as the institution's president. On February 17, 2006 the UMW Board of Visitors had selected <a>William Frawley</a>, Dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences at <a>The George Washington University</a>, as the next president of the University. Dr. Frawley's presidency began on July 1, 2006. He was inaugurated on September 30, 2006.</p>
<p>On April 11, 2007, Dr. Frawley was arrested on DUI charges for two consecutive offenses. After a unanimous vote from the Board of Visitors, he was dismissed. Richard V. Hurley served as Acting President.</p>
<p>The Board of Visitors published an announcement on March 10, 2008 naming <a>Dr. Judy Gayle Hample</a> as the new President of UMW. On November 17, 2008, she outlined her vision for the University, which includes her &quot;Students First&quot; initiative.</p>
<p>Dr. Hample has since been replaced by Rick Hurley.</p>
<p>The UMW Recycling Program currently collects corrugated cardboard, printer ink cartridges, mixed paper, newsprint and co-mingled plastic, glass, and aluminum. Each Residence Hall recycling program is led by a Recycling Coordinator (RAs) and an elected Hall Council Recycling Chairperson. In 2009, UMW participated in the RecycleMania competition and increased its amount of recycled material threefold.</p>
<p>UMW Ecology Group is the only student-run organization dedicated to sustainability on campus. The Ecology Club works as a part of the Campus Climate Challenge and is affiliated with the Virginia Climate Action Network.</p>
<h3>Graduate campus</h3>
<p>The University&#x2019;s <a>College of Graduate and Professional Studies</a> is located in nearby Stafford County. At this campus, working adults are able to take classes at night or on weekends to complete a bachelor&#x2019;s degree or earn a master&#x2019;s degree. Opened in 1999, the College of Graduate and Professional Studies now has more than 1,000 students enrolled in degree programs and other credit-bearing courses.</p>
