<h2>Residence Halls</h2>
<p>There are two residence halls on the MSU Billings campus.</p>
<h3>Petro Hall</h3>
<p>A 240 room &lt;!-- The website incorrectly states that it is 500 room. This is usual residency in the halls, depending on how many double or single rooms are used in a semester. --&gt;<a>residence hall</a> completed in <a>1965</a>. There are 8 floors, including the first floor Petro Theater and the second floor lobby, with 6 floors of 40 rooms. It is connected directly to the Petro Theater on the first floor, and also connected to the Student Union Building.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The athletic teams are nicknamed the <a>Yellowjacket</a> and compete in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Great Northwest Athletic Conference</a> and in the <a>Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference</a>. Montana State University Billings has an active athletic department, including a newly reformed <a>baseball</a> program.

<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p>The Yellowjackets men's basketball program has been at the forefront of the MSU Billings sports offerings since <a>football</a> was abandoned in the late 1970s.  The program, which rose to prominence during the early 1960s under coach Harry &quot;Mike&quot; Harkins, has lately been competitive within <a>NCAA</a> Div. II and while a member of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC).  In the past ten years the Yellowjackets have led Div. II (and in some cases all of the NCAA) in three-pointers made per game.  The school has finished under .500 only once in that timespan.</p>
<p>While <a>Roy McPipe</a> remains the only former player to be drafted by the <a>NBA</a> and play major professional basketball in the <a>United States</a>, many former players have found pro careers in Europe or in minor leagues in the states.</p>
<h3>Men's Baseball</h3>
<p>The Yellowjackets baseball program had originally been dropped in 1974, 5 years before the school moved from <a>NAIA</a> to an <a>NCAA</a> Div. II athletics program.  The baseball team was re-established in 2006, enjoying its first year ever as an NCAA baseball school under manager Chris Brown in the Heartland Conference.</p>
<p>The 2006 season started on February 24 with a 6-3 loss to <a>Northwest Nazarene University</a>.  The Jackets began the year on a 16 game road trip, losing all 16 games.  They started the year 0-18 before an 11-2 home win at <a>Cobb Field</a> against the same Northwest Nazarene team.  The Jackets finished their first NCAA season on a 15-17 run to finish 15-35. In 2007 the team completed its second season with a much improved 24-26 record.</p>
