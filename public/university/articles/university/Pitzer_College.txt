<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pitzer was founded in 1963 as a <a>women's college</a> by <a>Russell K. Pitzer</a> (1878&#x2013;1978), a California citrus magnate, philanthropist, and <a>Pomona College</a> alumnus.  In April 1963, poet and visionary <a>John W. Atherton</a> was hired as Pitzer's first president, and over the next seventeen months he recruited students, faculty, and trustees and constructed Scott and Sanborn Halls just in time for the fall 1964 semester.  During the College's first year, students and faculty created the curriculum and the school's system of governance.  The College graduated its first class of students in 1964 and became co-educational in the fall of 1970.  That first academic term began with ten professors and 153 students from sixteen states and five countries.</p>

The campus is located approximately  west of <a>LA/Ontario International Airport</a> and Los Angeles can be accessed via <a>Metrolink</a>, with the <a>station</a> located approximately eight blocks southwest of campus.  Access to campus is also provided via <a>Interstate 10</a> and <a>Interstate 210</a>.  The campus includes 16 buildings, including 5 residence halls. Three of the residence halls (Pitzer, Atherton and Sanborn) were built in 2007 and are <a>Gold LEED-Certified</a>. They received two design awards. In December 2010, the College will break ground on three new LEED-Certified residence halls on the northeast side of its campus, scheduled to be completed by fall 2012.</p>
<p>The Pitzer College campus occupies the northeast corner of the Claremont Colleges' property.</p>
<p>Currently, <a>Foothill Boulevard</a>/<a>Historic Route 66</a> and Harvey Mudd College border the campus to the north, Claremont Boulevard to the east, Ninth Street to the south, and North Mills Avenue to the west.  Possible future campus expansion into the Claremont University Consortium East Campus Property would extend the eastern boundary of campus towards Monte Vista Boulevard.  At present, the campus is split approximately in half by Pitzer Road.  Harvey Mudd College is adjacent to Pitzer&#x2019;s north, Scripps to the west, and Claremont McKenna to the south.</p>
<p><a>Contemporary architecture</a> characterizes the majority of Pitzer's buildings, several of which were designed by <a>Gwathmey-Siegel</a> following major donations from <a>Eli Broad</a>, a board member emeritus and former <a>chair</a> of the Pitzer College Board of <a>Trustee</a>s. A notable exception is the Grove House, a <a>California Bungalow</a> built in 1902 for a local citrus grower during the height of the <a>Arts and Crafts movement</a>.  The building, a popular campus hangout, was purchased for $1.00 and moved to Pitzer in 1977 under the direction of Professor <a>emeritus</a> <a>Barry Sanders</a>. The Grove House is home to a cafe, the Women's Center, the Hinshaw Gallery, the EcoCenter and a guest room. The <a>John R. Rodman Arboretum</a> is part of the campus, and most <a>landscaping</a> follows principles of <a>xeriscaping</a>.  Several varieties of <a>citrus</a> and other fruit are grown throughout campus and an organic <a>community garden</a>, dedicated <a>grove</a> and chicken coop are located north of Mead Hall.</p>
<p>The George C.S. Benson Auditorium opened in March 2009 and is designed to accommodate classes, panel discussions, film screenings, dance and musical performances, full theatrical productions, etc.</p>
<p>The Commencement Plaza and Recreation Fields are located on the southwest edge of campus. The beach volleyball and basketball courts opened in April 2010 and the first commencement was held on the new Commencement Plaza in May 2010. The plaza and fields are ringed by art benches, on which students can paint murals.</p>
<p>Joint Science Modular Units were installed along the southwest corner of the campus, formerly the Sanborn Parking Lot. These will open in fall 2010 and house science labs, classrooms and offices. In the future, a second Joint Science building will occupy this space.</p>
<p>A greenhouse, which houses the work of Pitzer's Vaccine Development Institute, is located northwest of the Grove House. It was completed in summer 2010 and work began there in fall 2010.</p>
<p>The main dining hall is in McConnell Center, and features an award-winning executive chef, organic and local ingredients and vegan and vegetarian options. The Pit-Stop Cafe, opened in fall 2009, serves organic, fair-trade coffee and espresso drinks, plus sandwiches, salads and pastries. The Shakedown Cafe, located in the Gold Student Center, is student-run and features organic world cuisine.</p>
<p>Located directly northwest of the main campus, the <a>Bernard Field Station</a> is an  nature preserve consisting of <a>coastal sage scrub</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;The Outback&quot; refers to the undeveloped area of campus bordered by Foothill Boulevard to the north, Claremont Boulevard to the east, Atherton and Sanborn Halls to the south, and Harvey Mudd College to the west. The area is characterized by plant communities that once covered most of the surrounding region, coastal sage scrub and <a>chaparral</a>.  There are many different areas situated throughout the Outback including: a small <a>gully</a> in the northeast corner, a stone bench/rock couch situated near the southern edge, as well as a small stone seat further north, there is an unfinished stone <a>pyramid</a>, the all-encompassing tree is near the center.</p>
<p>The campus lies less than five miles (8&nbsp;km) south of the <a>San Gabriel Mountains</a>, on top of the <a>alluvial fans</a> that come from nearby San Antonio Canyon.  The campus is relatively flat, with a 4% uphill grade from southwest to northeast.  <a>Mount Baldy</a> is  north of the College and is visible from the campus.  The <a>Mount Baldy Ski Lifts</a> is a popular spot for students to ski in the winter.  On clear days, the Chino Hills are visible to the south and <a>San Bernardino Mountains</a> to the east.</p>
<p>Finca La Isla del Cielo Pitzer owns and operates a  field station on secondary growth <a>rainforest</a>, the <a>Firestone Center for Restoration Ecology</a>.  The facility is located approximately two kilometers east of <a>Playa Dominical</a>, <a>Costa Rica</a>.  The property borders the <a>Hacienda Bar&#x00fa;</a> nature reserve.

<h3>Community involvement</h3>
<p>The Pitzer College community is especially known for its involvement outside of the classroom. Its students donate over 100,000 hours to community service annually. In 2008 and 2009, the College was named to the President&#x2019;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.  This distinction recognizes students, faculty, and staff for helping to build a culture of service and civic engagement.</p>
<p>Much of Pitzer's community engagement occurs under the auspices of the Community Engagement Center (CEC) (formerly Center for California Cultural and Social Issues), which strives to root community-based pedagogy more deeply into the College's curricular and research agendas.  By providing financial, technical and logistical support to develop innovative community-based projects as well as an institutional infrastructure to sustain and evaluate them, the Center engages international, national and local resources in a cooperative network aimed at defining and realizing the goals of various community partners.</p>
<p>The CEC runs the Pitzer in Ontario Program, a comprehensive semester-long service learning and cultural immersion program with a strong theoretical foundation in the human sciences informed by the best practices in the field of experiential education. The program integrates extensive internship experiences in city, private or non-profit organizations with interdisciplinary coursework that provides the theoretical framework from which social and urban issues can be effectively evaluated. Through living in Ontario, students have the opportunity to engage firsthand the diversity of voices, perspectives, and agendas that are driving those demands, and to come to a better understanding of the many layers of engaged citizenship.</p>
<p>At the <a>Campus Compact</a> 20/20 Visioning Summit on October 17, 2006, the <a>Corporation for National and Community Service</a> announced that Pitzer College is one of 28 campuses in California to be distinguished for community service and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.

<h3>Residential Life Project</h3>
<p>Pitzer is currently engaged in a multi-million dollar Residential Life Project to significantly expand the facilities of the College.</p>
<p>The Residential Life Project is expected to be completed in three phases over the next 10 to 15 years. Phase One, which included Sanborn, Pitzer, and Atherton Halls, was completed and inaugurated in September 2007.</p>
<p><a>Robert Redford</a> and <a>Ed Begley, Jr.</a> were the keynote speakers at the dedication ceremony of the Residential Life Project.  The new residence halls received <a>LEED Gold recognition</a> by the <a>United States Green Building Council</a> in 2008.  The College's Green Bike Program is an integral part of the Residential Life Project, and helped secure certain points needed for eventual GOLD Certification.</p>
<p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the national standard for sustainable buildings created by the U.S. Green Building Council. Phase I achieved Gold certification, and with the completion of the third phase of the Residential Life Project, Pitzer College is expected to become the first college in the nation to have all Gold or Platinum LEED certified residence halls.</p>
<h3>Student clubs and organizations</h3>
<p>There are more than 150 student clubs and organizations available to join within the Claremont College consortium.</p>
<p>Notable amongst these is the Green Bike Program, known as &quot;the GBP&quot;, a student run bicycle <a>collective</a> that maintains a full service shop, as well as fleet of 100+ recovered and reused bicycles that are raffled off free of charge each semester for student use. The GBP works to provide an alternative mode of transportation to combat the predominate and destructive <a>car culture</a> in Southern California, as well as to reduce consumption and <a>consumerism</a> while increasing the practical use of recycled and reused materials. As the only organization of its kind in the area, save for the sister-GBP at <a>Pomona College</a>, the GBP maintains a strong <a>DIY</a> ethic, and has in recent years become a social hub for both student and community activism.</p>
