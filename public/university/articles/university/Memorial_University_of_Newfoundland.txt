<h2>History</h2>
<p>Memorial University of Newfoundland is a non-denominational university in <a>St John's, Newfoundland</a>. Memorial University began as Memorial University College (MUC), which opened in September 1925 at a campus on Parade Street in St. John's.</pre>
<p><a>Alan Beddoe</a> designed the coats of arms for the Memorial University of Newfoundland. The post-Confederation government elevated the status of Memorial University College to full university status in August 1949, renaming the institution to Memorial University of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>The enrollment in MUN's first year was 307 students. In 1961, enrollment having increased to 1400, MUN moved from Parade Street to its present location on Elizabeth Avenue (Main Campus). </p>
