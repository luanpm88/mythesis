<h2>History</h2>
<p>Loras College, a <a>liberal arts college</a>, was founded in 1839 by the Most Rev. <a>Mathias Loras</a>, first bishop of Dubuque, who established Saint Raphael's Seminary to educate young men for the priesthood with the expressed intention of also providing an opportunity for higher education to the citizens of the area. The college has functioned under several names: <strong>Saint Raphael's Seminary</strong>, <strong>Mount St. Bernard's College and Seminary</strong>, <strong>St. Joseph's College</strong>, <strong>Dubuque College</strong>, and <strong>Columbia College</strong>.  The present name was adopted during the school's centennial in 1939.  That same year, the national Catholic honor society, <a>Delta Epsilon Sigma</a> was founded at the college, by Father Fitzgerald. From the time of its founding, the college has devoted its faculty and facilities to an undergraduate program; it conferred the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.</p>
<p>In 1963, when <a>The Catholic University of America</a> decided to discontinue its branch program of graduate study on the Loras campus, Loras College, realizing the growing need in the locale for study beyond the baccalaureate degree, initiated its Graduate Division offering the Master of Arts degree in some fields.</p>
<p>The College became coeducational in the fall of 1971. In 1973, the Associate of Arts and the Associate of Science degrees were introduced. The Division of Community Education was initiated in 1975.</p>
<p>Both the Undergraduate College and the Graduate Division of Loras College are accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The teacher education program, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, is accredited by the Iowa Department of Education. The undergraduate teacher education program is also accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. The <a>American Chemical Society</a> has approved the undergraduate chemistry program. Loras College is also approved by the <a>Association of American Universities</a> and <a>New York Board of Regents</a>. The Council of Social Work Education has accredited the social work major at the baccalaureate level.</p>
