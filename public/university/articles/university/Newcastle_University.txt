<p><strong>Newcastle University</strong> is a major research-intensive <a>university</a> located in <a>Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in the <a>north-east</a> of <a>England</a>. It was established as a School of Medicine and Surgery in 1834 and became the <strong>University of Newcastle upon Tyne</strong> by an Act of Parliament in August 1963. Newcastle University is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a>, an association of research-intensive UK universities. The University has one of the largest EU research portfolios in the UK. The <a>post-nominal letters</a> of graduates commonly have <strong>N'cle</strong> attached to indicate the institution.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University has its origins in the School of Medicine and Surgery which was established in <a>Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in October 1834, providing basic lectures and practical demonstrations to around 26 students. In June 1851, following a dispute amongst the teaching staff, the School was split into two rival institutions: the majority forming the <em>Newcastle College of Medicine</em>, with the others establishing themselves as the <em>Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science</em>. By 1852, the majority college was formally linked to the <a>University of Durham</a>, its first 'Licence in Medicine' (Lic.Med) being awarded in 1856, and its teaching certificates were recognised by the <a>University of London</a> for graduation in medicine. The two colleges amalgamated in 1857 and renamed the <em>University of Durham College of Medicine</em> in 1870.</p>
<p>Attempts to realise a place for the teaching of sciences in the city were finally met with the foundation of the College of Physical Science in 1871. The college offered instruction in mathematics, physics, chemistry and geology to meet the growing needs of the mining industry, becoming the <em>Durham College of Physical Science</em> in 1883 and then renamed after  <a>William George Armstrong</a> as <em><a>Armstrong College</a></em> in 1904. Both these separate and independent institutions later became part of the University of Durham, whose 1908 Act formally recognised that the University consisted of two Divisions, Durham and Newcastle, on two different sites. By 1908, the Newcastle Division was teaching a full range of subjects in the Faculties of Medicine, Arts, and Science, which also included agriculture and engineering.</p>
<p>Throughout the early 20th century, the medical and science colleges vastly outpaced the growth of their Durham counterparts and a <a>Royal Commission</a> in 1934 recommended the merger of the two colleges to form <em>King's College, Durham</em>. Growth of the Newcastle Division of the federal Durham University led to tensions within the structure and on 1 August 1963 an <a>Act of Parliament</a> separated the two, creating the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|250px|right|King's Walk, giving access to the Union Building (left) and the arches of the Fine Art Building, leading into the Quadrangle.</a> [[File:Newcastle University Open Street Map.png|thumb|A map of the main campus and surrounding area (from [[OpenStreetMap]] and is incomplete).]] The university occupies a campus site close to <a>Haymarket</a> in central Newcastle upon Tyne. It is located to the northwest of the city centre between the open spaces of <a>Leazes Park</a> and the <a>Town Moor</a>. </p>
<p>The Armstrong building is the oldest building on the campus and is the site of the original Armstrong College. The building was constructed in three stages; the north east wing was completed first at a cost of <a>&#x00a3;</a>18,000 and opened by <a>HRH Princess Louise</a> on 5 November 1888. The south-east wing, which includes the Jubilee Tower, and south-west wings were opened in 1894. The Jubilee Tower was built with surplus funds raised from an Exhibition to mark <a>Queen Victoria</a>'s <a>Jubliee</a> in 1887. The north-west front, forming the main entrance, was completed in 1906 and features two stone figures to represent science and the arts. Much of the later construction work was financed by Sir Isaac <a>Lowthian Bell</a>, the <a>metallurgist</a> and former <a>Lord Mayor</a> of Newcastle, after whom the main tower is named. In 1906 it was opened by <a>King Edward VII</a>.</p>
<p>The building contains the <em>King's Hall</em>, which serves as the university's chief hall for ceremonial purposes where <a>Congregation</a> ceremonies are held. It can contain 500 seats. King Edward VII gave permission to call the Great Hall, King's Hall. </p>
<p>The Bruce Building is a former brewery, constructed between 1896 and 1900 on the site of the Hotspur Hotel, as the new premises of <a>Newcastle Breweries</a> Limited.</p>
<p>The Devonshire Building, opened in 2004, incorporates in an energy efficient design <a>photovoltaic cell</a>s which help to power the motorised shades which control the temperature of the building and <a>geothermal heating</a> coils. Its architects won awards in the Hadrian awards and the <a>RICS</a> Building of the Year Award 2004. The university won a Green Gown award for its construction. </p>
<p>Plans for additions and improvements to the campus were made public in March 2008 and completed in 2010 at a cost of &#x00a3;200&nbsp;million. They include a redevelopment of the south-east (<a>Haymarket</a>) fa&#x00e7;ade with a five-storey King's Gate building and sculpture as well as new student accommodation. Two additional buildings for the school of medicine were also built.</p>
<p>In addition to the city centre campus there are buildings such as the <a>Dove Marine Laboratory</a> located on <a>Cullercoats</a> Bay. The University also has two branches in <a>Asia</a>; in Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>Newcastle University Library has received the <a>Charter Mark</a> five times in a row. It consists of three main facilities. The Robinson Library is the main University library. It is named after Philip Robinson, a bookseller in the city following a bequest in the <a>will</a> of his widow Marjorie in 1989. A major refurbishment was completed in 2009. The Walton Library specialises in services for Biomedical Sciences in the Medical School. It is named after <a>Lord Walton of Detchant</a>, former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Professor of Neurology. The library has a relationship with the Northern region of the <a>NHS</a> allowing their staff to use the library for research and study. The Law Library specialises in resources relating to law. Some schools within the University, such as the School of Modern Languages, also have their own smaller libraries with smaller highly-specialised collections.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The current <a>Chancellor</a> is Sir <a>Liam Donaldson</a>. Donaldson is also currently the <a>Chief Medical Officer</a> for <a>England</a>. Donaldson assumed the position of Chancellor on 1 August 2009. The vice-chancellor is <a>Chris Brink</a>, a mathematician and lately <a>vice-chancellor</a> of the <a>University of Stellenbosch</a>.</p>
<p>The University has a core population of 19,700 students (2006&#x2013;2007), including more than 2,000 overseas students from over 100 countries. is contested by major sports teams from Newcastle and <a>Northumbria University</a>, and the <a>Northumbrian Water University Boat Race</a> takes place each year between the <a>rowing</a> clubs of Newcastle and <a>Durham University</a>.</p>
<p>It holds a series of public lectures, named Insights, each year in the Curtis Auditorium in the Herschel Building. Many of the Universities partnerships with companies, like <a>Red Hat</a>, are housed in the Herschel Annex.</p>
<p>Newcastle was the only UK university to formally back the <a>Jubilee Debt Campaign</a> for the cancellation of debt in developing countries, and it has a strong ongoing commitment to the <a>Make Poverty History</a> campaign. At a high-profile honorary degree ceremony in January 2007, the University awarded honorary degrees to <a>Bob Geldof</a>, <a>Gordon Brown</a> MP, and <a>Benjamin Mkapa</a> (former president of <a>Tanzania</a>) among others, at an event which promoted debate on current debt-relief issues.</p>
<p>In 2006, the University was granted <a>Fair trade</a> status, and from January 2007, it became a smoke-free campus. In September 2008 the university's first overseas branch was opened in <a>Singapore</a>, a Marine International campus called, NUMI Singapore. In 2011 the university Medical School are to open a campus in Malaysia, called Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed).</p>
<p>The University has also been actively involved with several of the region's museums for many years; the <a>Hancock Museum</a> - recently refurbished and re-opened in May 2009 - is one such example.</p>
