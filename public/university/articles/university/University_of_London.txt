<p></p>
<p>Based primarily in <a>London</a>, <a>England</a>, the <strong>University of London</strong> is a federal <a>mega university</a> made up of 31 affiliates: 19 separate university institutions, and 12 research institutes. As such,  the University of London is the largest university in the <a>UK</a> by number of full-time students, with 135,090 campus-based students and over 45,000 in the <a>University of London International Programmes</a>. </p>
<p>The university was first established by a <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1836, which brought together in federation <em>London University</em> (now <a>University College London</a>) and <em>King's College</em> (now <a>King's College London</a>), to establish today's federally-structured University of London.  </p>
<p>Graduates of the University of London may use the post-nominal letters 'Lond.' (<em>Londiniensis</em>) after their degree abbreviations (see <a>post-nominal abbreviations</a>).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:William IV.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The University of London was granted its royal charter in 1836 by [[King William IV]]]] [[Image:The London University by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1827-28.JPG|right|thumb|200px|<em>The London University</em> as drawn by [[Thomas Hosmer Shepherd]] and published in 1827/28. This building is now part of <a>University College London</a>, which today is one of the many constituent colleges and institutes of the University of London.]]  [[Image:University of London illustration 1867.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[6 Burlington Gardens]], home to the university administration from 1870 to 1899.]]</p>
<p>Founded in 1836, the University at first comprised just two colleges: <a>University College London</a>, which previously had no official chartered status and did not apply religious tests to its students, and <a>King's College London</a>, which had been chartered since 1829 and which admitted only members of the <a>Church of England</a>. Both King's (founded 1829) and University College London (founded 1826) pre-date the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for the constituent colleges.</p>
<p>In 1858 the University expanded its role by offering the <a>University of London International Programmes</a> to candidates outside of the colleges, the first of its kind in the country. A new headquarters at <a>6 Burlington Gardens</a>, providing the university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role. In 1878 the University set another first when it became the first university in the UK to admit women on equal terms with men. Four female students obtained <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees in 1880 and two obtained <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees in 1881, again the first in the country.</p>
<p>In 1898, in part as a response to criticisms of universities which merely served as centres for the administration of tests, and calls for research and education to be more central functions of universities, the first University of London Act was passed, reforming the University and giving it responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions. The monitoring was conducted through newly formed centralised faculties and Boards of Studies, and King's and UCL now became constituent parts of the University of London. A symbolic element to the new centralisation of the University was the fact that UCL property became property of the University of London.</p>
<p>This significant expansion of role meant the University again needed more space, and so 6 Burlington Gardens was vacated in 1899. Shortly after the 6 Burlington Gardens was vacated the University went through a period of rapid expansion. <a>Bedford College</a>, <a>Royal Holloway</a> and the <a>London School of Economics</a> all joined in 1900, <a>Regent's Park College</a>, which had affiliated in 1841 became an official divinity school of the university in 1901, <a>Goldsmiths College</a> joined in 1904, <a>Imperial College</a> was founded in 1907, <a>Queen Mary College</a> joined in 1915, the <a>School of Oriental and African Studies</a> was founded in 1916 and <a>Birkbeck</a> joined in 1920. This rapid expansion meant that the University's new premises would prove insufficient by the 1920s, requiring yet another move. A large parcel of land in <a>Bloomsbury</a> near the <a>British Museum</a> was acquired from <a>the Duke of Bedford</a> and <a>Charles Holden</a> was appointed architect with the instruction to create a building &quot;not to suggest a passing fashion inappropriate to buildings which will house an institution of so permanent a character as a University.&quot; This unusual remit may have been inspired by the fact that <a>William Beveridge</a>, having just become director of LSE, upon asking a taxi driver to take him to the University of London was met with the response &quot;Oh, you mean the place near the <a>Royal School of Needlework</a>&quot;. Holden responded by designing Senate House, the current headquarters of the university, and at the time of completion the second largest building in London.</p>
<p>During the <a>Second World War</a> the colleges of the university (with the exception of Birkbeck) and their students left London for safer parts of the UK, while Senate House was used by the <a>Ministry of Information</a>, with its roof becoming an observation point for the <a>Royal Observer Corps</a>. Though the building was hit by bombs several times it emerged from the war largely unscathed; rumour at the time had it that the reason the building had fared so well was that <a>Adolf Hitler</a> had planned to use it as his headquarters in London.</p>
<p>The latter half of the last century was less eventful. In 1948, Athlone Press was founded as the publishing house for the university, and sold to the Bemrose Corporation in 1979, subsequent to which it was acquired by <a>Continuum publishing</a>. However, the post-WWII period was mostly characterised by expansion and consolidation within the university, such as the acquisition as a constituent body of the Jesuit theological institution Heythrop College on its move from Oxfordshire in 1969.  Nevertheless, some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King's, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university. There was a marked transference of academic and financial power in this period from the central authorities in <a>Senate House</a> to the individual colleges. There was also a tendency for smaller colleges to be amalgamated into larger &quot;super-colleges&quot;. A significant development in this process was the closing down of the <a>Convocation</a> of all University of London alumni in October 2003; this recognised that individual college alumni associations were now increasingly the centre of focus for alumni.</p>
<p>In 2002, <a>Imperial College</a> and <a>UCL</a> mooted the possibility of a merger. This raised a question mark over the future of the University of London and the autonomy of smaller colleges within it. Subsequently considerable opposition from academic staff of both UCL and Imperial led to a rejection of the merger.</p>
<p>On 9 December 2005, Imperial College became the first college to make a formal decision to leave the university. Its council announced that it was beginning negotiations to withdraw from the university in time for its own centenary celebrations, and in order to be able to award its own degrees. On 5 October 2006, the University of London accepted Imperial's formal request to withdraw from the federation. Imperial became fully independent on 9 July 2007, as part of the celebrations of the college's centenary. </p>
<p>The <em><a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em> announced in February 2007 that the <a>London School of Economics</a>, <a>University College London</a> and <a>King's College London</a> all plan to start awarding their own degrees, rather than degrees from the federal University of London as they have done previously, from the start of the new academic year (starting in Autumn 2007). Although this plan to award their own degrees does not amount to a decision to formally leave the University of London, the THES suggests that this 'rais[es] new doubts about the future of the federal University of London'. However, the University continues to grow and, in 2005, admitted the <a>Central School of Speech and Drama</a>.</p>
<p>As of April 1, 2010, <a>London Business School</a> has formally ceased awarding University of London affiliated degrees.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>[[Image:Senate House, University of London.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Senate House (University of London)|The Senate House]], the headquarters of the federal University of London]]</p>
<p>The University of London owns a considerable central London estate of 180 buildings in <a>Bloomsbury</a>, near <a>Russell Square tube station</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the University's colleges have their main buildings on the estate. The Bloomsbury Campus also contains eight Halls of Residence and <a>Senate House</a>, which houses the <a>Senate House Library</a>, the chancellor's official residence and previously housed the <a>School of Slavonic and East European Studies</a>, now part of <a>University College London</a> (UCL) and housed in its own new building. Almost all of the <a>School of Advanced Study</a> is housed in Senate House and neighbouring Stewart House.</p>
<p>The University also owns many of the squares which formed part of the Bedford Estate, including <a>Gordon Square</a>, <a>Tavistock Square</a>, <a>Torrington Square</a> and <a>Woburn Square</a>.</p>
<p>The estate includes several properties outside Bloomsbury also, with many of the University's colleges and institutes occupying their own estates across London.  <a>Clare Market</a> and part of <a>Aldwych</a> where the <a>London School of Economics and Political Science</a> is based, as well as the West Wing of <a>Somerset House</a>, the location for the <a>Courtauld Institute of Art</a> and <a>King's College London</a>, St Bart's Hospital, the University of London Boat Club in <a>Chiswick</a> and the Egham campus of <a>Royal Holloway</a> with its historic <a>Founder's Building</a> are also examples of properties which form part of the University's estate.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several properties outside London, including the <a>University Marine Biological Station, Millport</a> on the Isle of <a>Cumbrae</a>, a number of residential and catering units further afield and the premises of the <a>University of London Institute in Paris</a> which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in French and Historical Studies.</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>The University of London first received a grant of arms in April 1838. The arms depict a cross of St George upon which there is a Tudor rose surrounded by detailing and surmounted by a crown. Above all of this there is a blue field with an open book upon it.</p>
<p>In terms of heraldry the arms would be described as:</p>
<p><em>Argent, the Cross of St George, thereon the Union Rose irradiated and ensigned with the Imperial Crown proper, a Chief Azure, thereon an open Book also proper, Clasps gold</em></p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The nine largest institutions of the federal university, usually termed <em>the colleges</em>, are <a>Birkbeck</a>, <a>Goldsmiths</a>, <a>King's College London</a>, the <a>London Business School</a>, <a>Queen Mary</a>, <a>Royal Holloway</a>, the <a>School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, <a>London School of Economics and Political Science</a> and <a>University College London</a> (UCL). Formerly a constituent college, the <a>Imperial College London</a> left the University of London in 2007.</p>
<p>For most practical purposes, ranging from admission of students to negotiating funding from the government, the 19 constituent <em>colleges</em> are treated as individual universities. Legally speaking they are known as <em>Recognised Bodies</em>, with the authority to examine students and have the university award them degrees. Some colleges have recently obtained the power to award their own degrees and the University has amended its statutes to allow them to do so and yet remain in the University federation. For instance, beginning in the 2007/08 academic year, <a>King's College London</a>, the <a>Institute of Education</a>, and <a>University College London</a> began awarding their own degree certificates while retaining their constituent-college status within the University of London. </p>
<p>The twelve institutes, or <em>Listed Bodies</em>, within the University of London offer courses leading to degrees that are both examined and awarded by the University of London. Additionally, twelve universities in <a>England</a>, several in <a>Canada</a> and many in other <a>Commonwealth</a> countries (notably in <a>East Africa</a>) began life as associate colleges of the university offering such degrees. By the 1970s almost all of these colleges had achieved independence from the University of London. An increasing number of overseas academic institutes offer courses to support students registered for the <a>University of London International Programmes</a>'s diplomas and degrees and a new Institutions Policy Framework is currently being developed to accommodate these institutions. Up to now, no accreditation from London for these schools has existed other than the final examinations administered by the University of London which all pupils take.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 2010, The Collegiate Council of the University of London is set to consider <a>City University London</a>, which incorporates <a>Cass Business School</a> and the former <a>Inns of Court School of Law</a>, and their application to join the University of London. The decision has not yet been finalised but a decision is expected before the end of 2010.</p>

<h2>Administrative structure</h2>
<p>Most decisions affecting the constituent colleges and institutions of the University of London are made at the level of the colleges or institutions themselves. The University of London does retain its own decision-making structure, however, with the Collegiate Council and Board of Trustees, responsible for matters of academic policy. The Collegiate Council is made up of the Heads of Colleges of the University.</p>

<h3>Former colleges</h3>
<p>Some colleges of the University of London have been amalgamated into larger colleges or left the University of London. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Bedford College</a> - Inner Circle <a>Regent's Park</a>; now part of Royal Holloway and Bedford New College (the registered Royal Charter title of Royal Holloway, University of London)</li>
  <li><a>Chelsea College of Science and Technology</a> - Hortensia Road, <a>Chelsea</a>; now part of King's College</li>

  <li><a>School of Slavonic and East European Studies</a> - now part of University College London.</li>
  <li><a>Regent's Park College</a> moved to Oxford in 1927, becoming a <a>Permanent Private Hall</a> of the <a>University of Oxford</a> from 1957.</li>
</ul>
<h3>University colleges in the International degree programme</h3>
<p>A number of major universities originated as university colleges teaching the degrees of the <a>University of London International Programmes</a>. After developing the ability to function fully, these colleges became able to award their own degrees.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>University College Colombo</a>, established by the Ceylon University Ordinance Act in 1942 as the <a>University of Ceylon</a>.</li>
  <li>University College Nottingham, awarded a Royal Charter in 1948 as the <a>University of Nottingham</a>.</li>
  <li>University College Southampton, awarded a Royal Charter in 1952 as the <a>University of Southampton</a>.</li>
  <li>University College Leicester, awarded a Royal Charter in 1957 as the <a>University of Leicester</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other colleges had degrees validated and awarded by the University of London.</pre>
<ul>
  <li><a>St. Patrick's, Carlow College</a>, Ireland - from 1840-1892 students studied for primary degrees in Arts (BA) and  Law(BLL).</li>
  <li><a>St. Patrick's College, Thurles</a>, Ireland - from 1849 the University of London, allowed Thurles to offer degrees.</li>
  <li>Huddersfield College</li>
  <li><a>Queen's College, Birmingham</a></li>
  <li><a>Stoneyhurst College</a>, the Catholic Seminary in Lancashire.</li>
  <li><a>Wesleyan Collegiate Institution, Taunton</a>, which became Queen's College, Taunton.</li>
  <li><a>Ceylon Technical College</a>, 1933 - 1950 students studied for engineering degrees in BSc in Engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Colleges in special relation</h3>
<p>Between 1946 and 1970, the University entered into 'schemes of special relation' with university colleges in the <a>Commonwealth of Nations</a>. These schemes encouraged the development of independent universities by offering a relationship with the University of London. University colleges in these countries were granted a <a>Royal Charter</a>. An Academic Board of the university college negotiated with the University of London over the entrance requirements for the admission of students, syllabuses, examination procedures and other academic matters. During the period of the special relationship, graduates of the colleges were awarded University of London degrees.</p>
<p>Some of the colleges which were in special relation are listed below, along with the year in which their special relation was established.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1946 - The University College of the West Indies, until 1961. (Now the <a>University of the West Indies</a>)</li>
  <li>1948 - University College, Ibadan, until 1967. (Now the <a>University of Ibadan</a>)</li>
  <li>1956 - University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now the <a>University of Zimbabwe</a>).</li>
  <li>1961 - Royal College Nairobi (now the <a>University of Nairobi</a>).</li>
  <li>1963 - <a>University of East Africa</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1970 the 'Schemes of Special Relation' were phased out.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:ULU building.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of London Union]] building]]</p>
<p>Some 135,090 students (approximately 5% of all UK students) attend one of the University of London's <a>affiliated schools</a>. Additionally, over 45,000 students follow the <a>University of London International Programmes</a>. and offers its own gym and swimming pool for student use.</p>
<h3>Intercollegiate halls</h3>
<p>The University also runs eight intercollegiate <a>halls of residence</a>, accommodating students from most of the colleges and institutions of the University:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>College Hall</a>, <a>Malet Street</a>, WC1</li>
  <li><a>Connaught Hall</a>, <a>Tavistock Square</a>, WC1</li>
  <li><a>International Hall</a>, <a>Brunswick Square</a>, WC1</li>
  <li><a>Lillian Penson Hall</a>, Talbot Square, W2 <em>(postgraduate students only)</em></li>
  <li><a>Nutford House</a>, Brown Street, W1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Garden Halls</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Canterbury Hall</a>, Cartwright Gardens, WC1</li>
  <li><a>Commonwealth Hall</a>, Cartwright Gardens, WC1&lt;ref name=&quot;london1&quot;/&gt; <em>(paired with Hughes-Parry Hall for administration)</em></li>
  <li><a>Hughes Parry Hall</a>, Cartwright Gardens, WC1&lt;ref name=&quot;london1&quot;/&gt; <em>(paired with Canterbury Hall for administration)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sports, clubs and traditions</h2>
<p>Though most sports teams are organised at the college level, <a>ULU</a> does run a number of sports clubs of its own, some of which (for example the <a>basketball</a> team) compete in <a>BUCS</a> leagues. The union also organises its own leagues for college teams to participate in. These leagues and sports clubs are supported by Friends of University of London Sport which aims to promote them.</p>
<p>In addition to these ULU caters for sports not covered by the individual colleges through clubs such as the <a>University of London Union Lifesaving Club</a>, which helps students gain awards and learn new skills in <a>lifesaving</a> as well as sending teams to compete throughout the country in the <a>BULSCA</a> league.</p>
<p>By far the most successful ULU is the Dragons, the Universities Ice Hockey team who continue time and time again win in the <a>British Universities Ice Hockey Association</a> Division 1 and Division 2.  The Dragons have also previously competed in tourney's including professional teams and have come away with several gold and silver medals from these events.</p>
<p>ULU also organises a number of societies, ranging from Ballroom and Latin American Dance to <a>Shaolin Kung Fu</a>, and from the <a>University of London Big Band</a> to the <a>Breakdancing</a> Society. Affiliated to the University is the <a>University of London Society of Change Ringers</a>, a society for bellringers at all London universities.</p>
<p>The University runs the famous <a>University of London Boat Club</a>, which is considered along with the <a>Oxford University Boat Club</a> and the <a>Cambridge University Boat Club</a> to be one of the three best university rowing clubs in the country.</p>
<p>The University also has a representative football team, which dates back to 1913 and is a collection of the best players from the various colleges. The team plays games against sides such as Cambridge's and Oxford's 'Blues' sides as well as the R.A.F, Navy and Army. Currently the team has use of both Motspur Park Athletics Stadium (<a>Fulham F.C.</a>'s training ground, and a former University of London property) and the <a>Honourable Artillery Company</a>'s grounds for training and home match purposes. Former players and managers of the team include <a>Bobby Robson</a> and <a>Jimmy Hill</a>.</p>
<p>University of London Orienteering Club is an umbrella club for all University of London orienteering groups. Members participate in orienteering events across the UK, and occasionally further afield. In 1997 the club sent a team to participate in the US championships in Colorado.</p>
<h2>University of London people</h2>
