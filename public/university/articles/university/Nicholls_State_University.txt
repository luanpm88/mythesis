<p><strong>Nicholls State University</strong>, founded in 1948, is a public <a>university</a> located in <a>Thibodaux</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, USA. Nicholls is part of the <a>University of Louisiana System</a> of universities. Originally called Francis T. Nicholls Junior College, the institution split from the <a>Louisiana State University System</a> in 1956.  The university is named for <a>Francis T. Nicholls</a>, a former <a>governor of Louisiana</a>, and member of the <a>Louisiana Supreme Court</a>. </p>
<p>The  campus, once part of historic Acadia Plantation, fronts on Bayou Lafourche, about  southwest of <a>New Orleans</a> and  southeast of <a>Baton Rouge</a>. </p>
<p>Nicholls is located in <a>Acadiana</a>, also known as &quot;<a>Cajun</a> Country,&quot; an area rich in tradition and culture. It is also located in the heart of the <a>Mississippi River Delta</a>, allowing easy access to the river, its distributaries, <a>Louisiana's wetlands</a>, and the <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>. The school is sometimes referred to as &quot;Our Harvard on the Bayou;&quot; the university bookstore even sells shirts sporting this light-hearted nickname. More recently, however, students and faculty have been referring to Nicholls as &quot;Berkeley on the Bayou,&quot; because of the university's encouraging atmosphere towards creativity and innovation that goes hand-in-hand with faculty and student engagement. The Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) at Nicholls&#x2014;which focuses on critical thinking&#x2014;has the motto &quot;L'esprit engag&#x00e9;,&quot; which means &quot;the engaged mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholls is the home of the <a>John Folse Culinary Institute</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The University of Louisiana System has identified the following areas as Unique Areas of Excellence at Nicholls State University. These are areas of study that, because of either their unique classes or their leadership in Louisiana education, have been selected for this special honor. John Folse Culinary Institute, Biological Sciences - Marine and environmental sciences emphasis, Nursing, Allied Health Sciences, Teacher Education, Accounting and Information Systems, and Child, Family and Social Services. Other notable degree programs include: Bachelor degrees in Art, English, Mass Communication, and Music; and Master degrees in Biology, Education, and Business Administration (in addition to an Executive MBA program). Education at the undergraduate and graduate level at Nicholls is one of the most affordable in Louisiana itself as well as in the country.</p>
<p>Nicholls is one of the first institutions in the United States to offer bachelor degrees in Culinary Arts. Students gain expertise in both Cajun and French cuisine. The John Folse Culinary Institute is the only American member of the prestigious Institut Paul Bocuse. Students also have the opportunity to earn a bachelor's degree in Culinary Arts and then work towards earning the MBA.</p>
<p>Nicholls' faculty have been recognized nationally and internationally by the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Phi Kappa Lambda, the Renaissance Society of America, and by many other organizations and associations. In the past three years, several faculty members have been awarded grants from the Louisiana Board of Regents. The university has the only certified geneticist in the South. It also has the highest rate of librarians with PhDs in both public and private universities and colleges in the state. Nicholls is also the home of the Center for Women in Government as well as the Dyslexia Center of Louisiana.</p>
<p>Recent <em>Princeton Review</em> statistics from 2010 list the student-to-faculty ratio as 20:1 at Nicholls. Admissions has become selective. The average GPA upon entry is 3.2 with an ACT score of 21. As expected, the average GPA of Honors students is 3.6 with an ACT score of 26. Almost 62 percent of the student body are women; and nearly 3 percent are international students (see <em>The Princeton Review</em> <a>http://www.princetonreview.com/NichollsStateUniversity.aspx</a>). As with nearly all academic institutions in Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina has had an impact on Nicholls' completion rate and overall ranking. During the aftermath of Katrina, Nicholls suspended its admissions selectivity in order to accommodate students from hurricane affected institutions. The university also had many matriculating students who were affected by the hurricane and did not return. College ranking systems and review publications fail to recognize these factors.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Nicholls sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (Football Championship Subdivision or FCS for <a>football</a>) in the <a>Southland Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Nicholls' colors are <a>red</a> and <a>gray</a> (two-tone) and the athletics teams are nicknamed the Colonels.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2005, the No. 24-ranked Nicholls Colonels football team clinched its first Southland Conference Championship by defeating the <a>McNeese State</a> Cowboys 39-26 at John L. Guidry Stadium. With that win, Nicholls finished the regular season tied atop the conference standing with Texas State. The Colonels advanced to the Division I-AA playoffs as the conference champion, based on their 32-29 overtime victory over then fifth-ranked Texas State, but eventually lost to the then No. 3 ranked <a>Furman</a> Paladins, 14-12, in Paladin Stadium in Greenville, S.C.</p>
<p>Nicholls official athletics mascot is the colonel.  President Stephen Hulbert stated that &quot;The Colonel is and will remain the mascot designation for Nicholls State University and its intercollegiate athletics program&quot; on March 31, 2004 while calling the current Colonel depiction antiquated and reminiscent of the Civil War in the South. The decision to retire the mascot was made to avoid portraying racist sentiments associated with the Civil War confederacy. Although met with criticism from the school and surrounding community who were in favor of preserving the colonel mascot, the retirement of the mascot was considered vital to the public relations outlook of the university and its policy of solidarity with The University of Louisiana System's policy on discrimination.  Hulbert banned the old Colonel from the university and tasked student leaders to work on a suitable replacement. That process lasted six years. The new Col. Tillou was introduced to the campus community in August 2009, sporting a bright red uniform topped off with a contemporary-style military officer's cap. </p>
<p>The Nicholls State University Department of Athletics currently sponsors men's intercollegiate baseball, basketball, football, golf and tennis along with women's intercollegiate basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, track, volleyball and cheerleading.</p>
<p>Nicholls' primary athletic rival is <a>Southeastern Louisiana University</a>.</p>
