<h2>Recent history</h2>

The administrative review was completed by early 2009, with reforms to be implemented during 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that UC would outsource several key administrative functions to <a>Wipro</a>, an Indian company. During June-July, 2009, the Vice-Chancellor then undertook reforms of performance expectations for academic staff in an effort to raise performance on key performance indicators. In July 2009, a new academic recruiting drive was announced , however the UC-branch of the <a>National Tertiary Education Union</a> is currently opposing the reforms and considering industrial action. </p>

<h2>Foundation stone and Stone Day</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Building 11, Walkway connecting the refectory with the gym.</a> </p>
<p>At the end of the year, after classes finish but before exams, Stone Day is usually held, a music festival with local bands, which lasts several days. The day before it is known as Stone Eve. It started as a celebration held annually to mark the placing of the foundation stone by <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>John Gorton</a> on 28 October 1968. This founded the Canberra College of Advanced Education, which became the University of Canberra in 1990.</p>
<p>The stone is under glass, outside, near Building 1 at the University, and an inscription on it reads:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years the Stone Day program has gradually become larger and larger, taking up a whole week and now Stonefest is one of Australia's most popular music festivals. The first foundation celebrations were held in 1971. In 1973 Stone Day celebrations were held over two days, which was expanded to take up a whole week in 1976. In the 1980s and 1990s Stoneweek became a popular Canberra entertainment event, which in 2000 became Stonefest.</p>
