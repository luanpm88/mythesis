<p><strong>Vassar College</strong> is a private, highly selective, <a>coeducational</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> in the town of <a>Poughkeepsie</a>, <a>New York</a>, in the <a>United States</a>. With 2,475 undergraduates, Vassar is known for its small class sizes and strong emphasis on teaching. Vassar's curriculum emphasizes interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary programs. The college was among the first to teach cognitive science, psychology, and Russian studies, and among the first to experiment with interdepartmental courses in the early 1900s. The Vassar campus comprises over  and more than 100 buildings, including four <a>National Historic Landmarks</a>, ranging in style from Collegiate Gothic to International, designed over the course of the college&#x2019;s history by a range of prominent architects, including <a>James Renwick Jr.</a>, <a>Eero Saarinen</a>, <a>Marcel Breuer</a>, and <a>Cesar Pelli</a>. A designated arboretum, the campus features more than 200 species of trees, a native plant preserve, and a  ecological preserve. Founded as a <a>women's college</a> in 1861, it became <a>coeducational</a> in 1969.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Vassar <a>was one of the first</a> of the <a>Seven Sisters</a>. It was founded by its namesake, brewer <a>Matthew Vassar</a>, in 1861 in the <a>Hudson Valley</a>, about 70&nbsp;mi (115&nbsp;km) north of <a>New York City</a>.  The first person appointed to the Vassar faculty was the <a>astronomer</a> <a>Maria Mitchell</a>, in 1865. Vassar adopted coeducation in 1969 after Vassar's trustees declined an offer to merge with <a>Yale University</a>. However, immediately following <a>World War II</a>, Vassar accepted a very small number of male students on the <a>G.I. Bill</a>. Because Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the <a>University of the State of New York</a>. These were reissued under the Vassar title after the school formally became co-ed.</p>
<p>[[File:Main building, Vassar College.jpg|430px|thumbnail|left|Main Building, built in 1861 by renowned architect [[James Renwick, Jr.]], had the most interior space of any building in the United States, until the US Capitol was completed in 1868.]]</p>
<p>Vassar's campus, also an <a>arboretum</a>, is 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) marked by period and modern buildings. The great majority of students live on campus. The renovated library has unusually large holdings for a college of its size. It includes special collections of <a>Albert Einstein</a>, <a>Mary McCarthy</a>, and <a>Elizabeth Bishop</a>.</p>
<p>In its early years, Vassar was associated with the social elite of the Protestant establishment. <a>E. Digby Baltzell</a> writes that &quot;upper-class <a>WASP</a> families ... educated their children at ... colleges such as <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Yale</a>, and Vassar.&quot; Before becoming President of the United States, <a>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> was a Trustee.</p>
<p>In recent freshman classes, minority students have comprised up to 27% of matriculants. International students from over 45 countries comprise 8% of the student body.  In May 2007, falling in with its commitment to diverse and equitable education, Vassar returned to a <a>need-blind</a> admissions policy wherein students are admitted by their academic and personal qualities, without regard to financial status.</p>
<p>Roughly 2,400 students attend Vassar. About 60% come from public high schools, and 40% come from <a>private schools</a> (both independent and religious). The overall female-to-male ratio is about 60:40, slightly above the standard for a liberal arts college. More than 85% of graduates pursue advanced study within five years of graduation. They are taught by more than 270 faculty members, virtually all of whom hold terminal degrees in their fields.</p>
<p>Vassar president <a>Frances D. Fergusson</a> served for two decades. She retired in the spring of 2006, and was succeeded by <a>Catharine Bond Hill</a>, former provost at <a>Williams College</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>[[File:Rockefeller Hall (Vassar College).jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|Rockefeller Hall, built in 1897, is home to the departments of Political Science, Philosophy, and Math.]] Vassar confers the <a>A.B.</a> degree in more than 50 majors, including the Independent Major, in which a student may design a major, as well as various interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields of study. Students also participate in such programs as the Self-Instructional Language Program (SILP) which offers courses in Hindi, Irish/Gaelic, Korean, Portuguese, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Vassar has a flexible curriculum intended to promote breadth in studies. While each field of study has specific requirements for majors, the only universal requirements for graduation are proficiency in a foreign language, a quantitative course, and a freshman writing course. Students are also strongly encouraged to <a>study abroad</a>, which they typically do during one or two semesters of their junior year. Students (usually juniors) may apply for a year or a semester away either in the U.S. or abroad. Vassar sponsors programs in China, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Spain and Russia; students may also join preapproved programs offered by other colleges. Students may also apply for approved programs at various U.S. institutions, including the historically Black colleges and members of the Twelve College Exchange.</p>
<p>All classes are taught by members of the faculty, and there are no graduate students or teachers' assistants. The most popular majors are <a>English</a>, <a>biology</a>, <a>political science</a>, <a>psychology</a> and <a>economics</a>. Vassar also offers a variety of correlate sequences, or minors, for intensive study in many disciplines.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p><a>Barron's</a> has placed Vassar in its &quot;most competitive&quot; category for admissions. It is ranked as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the United States by <em><a>U.S.News &amp; World Report</a></em>. The <a>Princeton Review</a> gave Vassar a selectivity rating of 97 out of 100. <a>Forbes Magazine</a> ranked Vassar in the top 25 &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; ranking of all higher education institutions (military academies, national research universities and liberal arts colleges combined) in the United States. In 2009 Vassar College was named among the ten best private liberal arts college values in the United States by Kiplinger&#x2019;s Personal Finance. Vassar was prior named the Time Magazine/Princeton Review &#x201c;College of the Year&#x201d; in 1999. It also numbers among the top ten undergraduate colleges producing Fulbright fellows in the U.S.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>[[File:Thompson Library Central Tower.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Central tower of the [[Thompson Memorial Library]], built in 1905.]] The Vassar campus has several buildings of architectural interest. <a>Main Building</a>, formerly housed the entire college, including classrooms, dormitories, museum, library, and dining halls. The building was designed by Smithsonian architect <a>James Renwick Jr.</a> and was completed in 1865. It was preceded on campus by the original <a>observatory</a>. Both buildings are <a>National Historic Landmark</a>s.  The <a>Rombout House</a> was purchased by the college in 1915 and added to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1982.</p>
<p>Many beautiful old <a>brick</a> buildings are scattered throughout the campus, but there are also several modern and contemporary structures of architectural interest. Ferry House, a student cooperative, was designed by <a>Marcel Breuer</a> in 1951. Noyes House was designed by Finnish-American architect <a>Eero Saarinen</a>. A good example of an attempt to use <a>passive solar</a> design can be seen in the Mudd Chemistry Building by Perry Dean Rogers. More recently, New Haven architect <a>C&#x00e9;sar Pelli</a> was asked to design the Lehman Loeb Art Center, which was completed in the early 1990s. In 2003, Pelli also worked on the renovation of Main Building Lobby and the conversion of the Avery Hall theater into the $25 million Vogelstein Center for Drama and Film, which preserved the original 1860s facade but was an entirely new structure.</p>
<h2>Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center</h2>
<p><a>320px|thumbnail|right|Vassar College was the first college in the United States to be founded with a full-scale museum as part of its original plan. Today, the Art Center boasts a collection of over 18,000 works. The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center is currently one of the largest college or university museums in the world, with over 18,000 works of art.</a></p>
<p> Matthew Vassar was known for declaring that &quot;art should stand boldly forth as an educational force.&quot; The art collection at Vassar dates to the founding of the College, when Vassar provided an extensive collection of <a>Hudson River School</a> paintings to be displayed in the Main Building.  Referred to as the Magoon Collection, it continues to be one of the best in the nation for Hudson River School paintings. The Frances Lehman Loeb Gallery displays a selection of Vassar's 18,000 articles of art in the building designed by <a>Cesar Pelli</a> (see Architecture). Today, the gallery's collection displays art from the ancient world up through contemporary works. The collection includes work by European masters such <a>Brueghel</a>, <a>Dor&#x00e9;</a>, <a>Picasso</a>, <a>Balthus</a>, <a>Bacon</a>, <a>Vuillard</a>, <a>C&#x00e9;zanne</a>, <a>Braque</a> and <a>Bonnard</a>, as well as examples from leading twentieth-century American painters <a>Jackson Pollock</a>, <a>Agnes Martin</a>, <a>Mark Rothko</a>, <a>Marsden Hartley</a>, <a>Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, <a>Charles Sheeler</a>, and <a>Ben Shahn</a>.  The Loeb's works on paper represent a major collection in the United States, with prints by <a>Rembrandt</a> (including important impressions of the &quot;<a>Hundred Guilder Print</a>&quot; and the &quot;Three Trees&quot;) and <a>D&#x00fc;rer</a> as well as photographs by <a>Cindy Sherman</a>, <a>Diane Arbus</a>, and others. Students at the college can act as liaisons between the art center and the wider college community through work on the Student Committee of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, to which incoming freshman can apply.</p>
<h2>After Vassar</h2>
<p>70% of Vassar graduates plan to pursue advanced study within 5 years of graduation. Of the seniors who applied to medical school, 85% were accepted. Of the seniors who applied to law school, 88% were accepted. Vassar offers a database of 3,000 volunteer alumni where students may seek career advice and opportunities.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Davison, one of Vassar's nine residence houses, was renovated during the 2008-2009 school year. The dorm went offline for that year and its residents were absorbed into the college's remaining residence houses. This is the second dorm to be renovated as part of the school's master plan to renovate all dorms, following Jewett a few years earlier. Lathrop was scheduled to be renovated during the 2010-2011 school year, but renovation has been put off indefinitely due to the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The interior and exterior of the Van Ingen Art Library was renovated from June 2008 - May 2009 in an effort to restore its original design and appearance. This was the library's first major renovation since its construction in 1937.</p>
<p>The school's bookstore, currently located on campus and operated by <a>Barnes and Noble</a>, was to be moved during the 2009-2010 school year to an off-campus location. The expanded bookstore was expected to carry a wider range of merchandise and will serve as a venue for appropriate entertainment. The relocation has been put on hold due to financial restrictions. There are also preliminary plans for a new science building. Mudd, the chemistry building, may be demolished to make room for the new construction.</p>
