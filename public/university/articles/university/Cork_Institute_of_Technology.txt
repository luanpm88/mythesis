<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cork Institute of Technology, and its predecessor Cork RTC developed from earlier institutions such as the <a>Royal Cork Institution</a> which existed from 1807 until 1861, and the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute which was founded in 1912, which trained students in Science and Engineering. In 1930 the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee was set up. Cork Regional Technical College was established in 1973 and the Crawford Institute was merged with the new Cork RTC in 1976.</p>
<p>Following enactment of the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, it incorporated the Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design on 1 January 1993.</p>
<h2>Main Campus</h2>
<p>&lt;gallery&gt; Image:Cork Institute of Technology Campus.jpg Image:Cork Institute of Technology Campus 2.JPG &lt;/gallery&gt;</p>
<p>The main campus of some eighty acres is situated in the western suburbs of Cork city. It is comprehensively equipped with theatres, lecture rooms, laboratories, drawing studios, a library, computer suites, open access computing centre and research units. Recreational facilities for students include a champion-standard running track, tennis courts, all weather pitch, an excellently appointed gymnasium and grass playing pitches. A new heated indoor swimming pool is located immediately adjacent to the Institute.</p>
<p>CIT's main campus has won numerous awards for its architectural design and aesthetics.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Research is a core dimension of CIT activity. This is underlined by the fact that, after <a>Dublin Institute of Technology</a>, CIT has the most extensive delegated authority to award PhDs. In collaboration with a wide range of organisations including Higher Education Institutions, Industry, State and Voluntary Bodies, CIT is involved in research that contributes to supporting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional and National Industry.</li>
  <li>The National and EU knowledge economy and Innovation Base.</li>
  <li>Enhanced quality of life within Irish society.</li>
  <li>Quality research postgraduate education at Masters and PhD level.</li>
  <li>Quality undergraduate and taught postgraduate teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main Institute research activity is primarily, though not exclusively, organised around three Strategic Research Clusters that reflect the CIT current dominant strategic research strengths and critical mass. There are also new and emerging areas of research and a number of long established centres that engage in research and consultancy. Across the Institute faculties and constituent colleges, academic staff research interests range across Engineering, Science, Business and Humanities, Music and Art. The CIT Research mission is to continue to build on niche strengths and to develop sustainable and productive research, innovation, technology transfer and postgraduate education across all its faculties.</p>
<h3>CIT NIMBUS Centre</h3>
<p>On 17 January 2010, CIT formally took possession of the new NIMBUS Centre for Embedded Systems Research and, on 16 March, 65 researchers and students relocated from diverse locations in CIT to the NIMBUS building.</p>
<p>Funded through the HEA Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) in 2007, NIMBUS is the first building nationally to be completed in the 4th cycle of PRTLI funding and reflects very successful collaboration and project management by the CIT Development Office, the architects RKD, building contractors Walls and the team of researchers for whom the building was designed. In a time of financial constraint, it also reflects well on the team that the project was completed on time and within budget.</p>
<p>Research Centre at CITThe NIMBUS Centre is adjacent to and attached to the Rubicon Centre and its extension (currently under construction). This reflects the determination of the NIMBUS researchers not only to carry out high quality research but also to ensure that the research feeds through to innovation and commercialisation, through licensing and new company start-ups. The integration of the Technologies for Embedded Computing (TEC) Centre (funded by Enterprise Ireland under the Applied Research Enhancement (ARE) programme) with NIMBUS further reflects this determination. This also exposes the Centre&#x2019;s postgraduate students to an innovation culture throughout their time carrying out research in the Centre. This strategy aligns closely with the recommendations of the recently published report from the Task Force on Innovation which call for a much greater emphasis on ensuring that research feeds through to tangible benefits to industry and on producing graduates who can contribute directly to Ireland&#x2019;s fast-growing knowledge economy. In this context, NIMBUS is currently training 32 postgraduate researchers and NIMBUS staff is actively involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching in the Department of Electronic Engineering in CIT.</p>
<p>The NIMBUS Centre provides space for up to 80 researchers, including facilities for undergraduate project students, visiting postgraduate students and researchers from other institutions and dedicated industry visitor workstations, already in use, where company researchers can work in close collaboration with NIMBUS staff and use NIMBUS research facilities.</p>
<p>NIMBUS is among the most heavily networked buildings in the country with high data rate wired and wireless network points throughout the building and a suite of communications antennae on the roof of the centre facilitate long distance wireless networking. A large area of the ground floor is given over to an open-plan laboratory space which will contain facilities for electronics prototyping and testing, RF/microwave testing and reliability testing. This space will also be used for both small- and large-scale demonstrations of embedded systems applications. NIMBUS is CIT&#x2019;s first dedicated research centre and is intended not only to be a showcase for CIT&#x2019;s research but also to demonstrate CIT&#x2019;s ability to translate innovative research into economic benefit. As embedded systems can benefit all technology disciplines and can be used in many applications including sensing, energy, health, manufacturing, safety, environment, logistics and business, NIMBUS welcomes collaborations with other researchers and companies interested in these and related topics.</p>
<h3>Collaborative European Research Conference</h3>
<p>The <a>Collaborative European Research Conference</a> (CERC) is a prestigious annual event that invites postgraduate students to submit papers and participate in a peer-reviewed event. CIT will host the 2011 CERC, scheduled to take place on the 14th and 15 January.</p>
<h2>Academic Alliances</h2>
<p>CIT holds a partnership with the <a>Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences</a> (h_da), Germany, one of Europe's most respected institutes in the fields of computer science and engineering. CIT's BA in Multimedia offers a joint accreditation from CIT and h_da.</p>
<p>CIT offer a number of degree courses in conjunction with <a>University College Cork</a>, including their BSc in Architecture and BSc in Biomedical Science.</p>
<p>The CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory runs a programme in partnership with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California. </p>
<p>CIT has also established various industrial alliances, particularly with the <a>EMC Corporation</a> and <a>VMware</a>, both of which have a business presence in Cork. The college also maintains close ties with to <a>Cisco Systems</a> and the <a>Cisco Networking Academy</a>. CIT is itself both an official VMware and Cisco academy, as well as a <a>Microsoft</a>, <a>Novell</a> and <a>ITIL</a> academy.</p>
<h2>CIT Rubicon Centre</h2>
<p>The Rubicon Centre is Ireland&#x2019;s premier business incubation centre and is located on campus at CIT. Home to over 40 knowledge-based start-up companies, the Centre is jointly financed by CIT &amp; Enterprise Ireland. Clients based at the Rubicon are at different stages of development, from concept stage to completing their first customer orders and many are already trading on the International Market. In 2007 a second incubation facility was opened to accommodate the demand for on-campus incubation space. An extension to the existing building is currently taking place &amp; it is hoped this will be fully operation by June 2010, increasing total incubation space to 2,100 square metres.  </p>
<p>Since opening its doors in January 2006, the Rubicon Centre has quickly positioned itself as a catalyst, assisting entrepreneurs to take their projects to the next stage. As an innovation centre for entrepreneurs, the Rubicon Centre is intended to help, encourage &amp; give support to people who present a unique idea or highlight a market niche which they believe they can target. In essence, the Centre&#x2019;s role as an incubator is to assist the formation and growth of early stage, knowledge intensive businesses, by providing physical space, in-house management support, access to advice and support from Institute resources. The Centre aims to stimulate an environment of creativity and innovation with a continual focus of nurturing the growth of knowledge based business and commercial research in the South West Region. The Centre has attracted interest from both Irish and Overseas Companies operating in the Technology market.</p>
<h3>Genesis Programme</h3>
<p>The Genesis Enterprise Programme is also based at CIT's Rubicon Centre, offering participants the opportunity to avail of a 12 month rapid incubation programme that aims to support and accelerate graduate entrepreneurs in developing their business from a very early stage. It has been in operation since 1998. The focus of the Genesis Programme is to provide a package of supports to entrepreneurs in the South West Region in accelerating the development of their business.</p>
<p>Businesses from diverse sectors have participated on the programme in the past including Food, Information Technology, Biotech, Telecommunications, Renewable Energy, Medical Device and Automotive. The key criteria for eligibility are that the business is knowledge based and has export potential. The Programme is currently funded by the Department of Education and Science and many of the participants are supported financially by Enterprise Ireland by way of a CORD grant. </p>
<p>The Genesis Programme is a full-time programme designed to provide an integrated and comprehensive set of business development and financial supports to graduates of third-level colleges who wish to start their own businesses. By developing the entrepreneurial skills of the participants and helping them realise the full potential of their businesses, the risk involved in setting up a business is reduced and the focus is on the development of scalable, high growth businesses.</p>

<h3>CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200 px|alt=CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory|CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.</a></p>
<p>Blackrock Castle was originally built on the <a>River Lee</a> in 1582 by the citizens of Cork as a watch tower and fort, assuring trade ships of a safe haven, the Elizabethan government of the era ordering a round tower constructed to protect against marauding pirates and other invaders. Following a charter by James I in 1608, Blackrock Castle was handed over to the City of Cork. In 1722 the old tower was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt with an octagonal room topped with a cupola. The castle was used at this time as the Corporation banquet hall. In 1827 the castle was again destroyed by fire, before being rebuilt a year later, three additional storeys and out-buildings being added at that time. In 2002 the castle underwent an extensive refurbishment programme, and in August 2007, Blackrock Castle was re-opened to the public as the state-of-the-art CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.</p>
<p><em>Cosmos at the Castle</em> is an award-winning interactive astronomy exhibit that takes place at the observatory, featuring four cinema sized screens that share information with visitors on the Big Bang, the evolution of life on Earth, and the existence of extraterrestrial life in the Universe.</p>
<p>The observatory also houses a team of astronomical researchers and scientists from CIT, most of which are engaged in the development of new technologies designed for searching for planets around distant stars, a project known as the Planet Search Programme. Most the researchers come from the Astronomy and Instrumentation Group, based within the Department of Applied Physics and Instrumentation at CIT. </p>
<p>The observatory features a rooftop 16&#x201d; Meade reflector telescope. A monthly remote astronomy schools project is run at the observatory. The project is entitled Web of Stars, and is run in conjunction with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California. </p>
<p>CIT is the Irish partner in the Comenius funded European Union Hands on Universe project. This project trains teachers to use real astronomy data in the classroom to support the teaching of science and mathematics.</p>
<p>The castle hosted the 2011 <a>Collaborative European Research Conference</a>.</p>
