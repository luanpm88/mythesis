<p>The <strong>University of Michigan&#x2013;Dearborn</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>UM-Dearborn</strong> or <strong>UM-D</strong>), is a public university located in <a>Dearborn, Michigan</a>, <a>USA</a>.  It is a campus of the <a>University of Michigan</a> and offers <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a>, and three <a>doctoral</a> degrees. It is ranked as the 4th best public masters's university in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Originally known for its elite engineering and management programs, UM-D now offers over 90 degree programs across all disciplines.  Both the College of Computer Science and Engineering and the College of Business have been designated as some of the best programs in both the nation and region.  A part of the <a>Metro Detroit</a> region, UM-D is also known for its community engagement within the city of Detroit, and is part of The Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Chancellor's Pond</a> The University of Michigan-Dearborn was founded in 1959 with a gift of  and $6.5 million dollars from <a>Ford Motor Company</a>.  Built as an elite automotive engineering and business management school, UM-D started near the Rouge River on what is known as <a>Fair Lane</a>.  As the university quickly grew to respond to the metropolitan region's needs, it established full fledged colleges in the arts, business, engineering, and education.</p>
<p>During the late 1990s and 2000s, the University approved the purchase of buildings north of Fair Lane and the construction and overhaul of several university buildings including the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters building, the University Center, the Science Learning and Research Center, and finally the Institute for Advanced Vehicular Studies.  The purchased buildings north of Fair Lane are now home to the College of Business and School of Education, giving space for expansion of the other two colleges.</p>
<p>In November 2008, the <a>University of Michigan</a> board of regents approved the establishment of Ph.D programs in information systems engineering and automotive systems engineering in the UM&#x2013;Dearborn College of Engineering and Computer Science beginning in Fall 2009. In February 2009, the regents approved an Ed.D. program at the UM-Dearborn School of Education, designed to provide the citizens of southeastern Michigan with a program that is well-matched to the economic, social and political challenges that face our region.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2008, facility planners at University of Michigan Dearborn began to consider adding a <a>dormitory</a> building to the campus for undergraduate students. The school is currently a commuter school.  The school issued an online survey to gain information about what the students felt would be the best option. The dormitory would be aimed at encouraging students to stay on campus full time to provide a better college environment feel. The aim would also be to gain additional students from around the state and country. The addition of dorms could also serve to ease the parking situation which has become a large problem for students especially in the peak hours for class.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|150px|right|UM-Dearborn Campus</a> The campus of the University of Michigan&#x2013;Dearborn is divided into several sections: The Henry Ford Estate, known as <a>Fair Lane</a>, The Fairlane Center, Main Campus, and recently has expanded the Early Childhood Education Center just south of campus.  In addition, the University boasts over 70 acres (283,000 m&#x00b2;) of nature preserve and a bird observatory,the Rouge River Bird Observatory, which has operated on campus since its founding in 1992. </p>
<p>Main Campus includes the facilities for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL), the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS),  the Environmental Interpretive Center, Administration, the Mardigian Library, the Institute for Advanced Vehicle Studies, the University Center, the Computing Building, and the Field House.  Within both CASL and CECS, many different buildings house different programs, departments, research centers, student life centers, and academic resources.  There are currently no dormitories on campus.</p>
<h3>Fair Lane</h3>
<p><a>Fair Lane</a> and the nature preserve west of campus are along the <a>Rouge River</a>.  There is a small waterfall, rose garden, meadow, a lake, and reflecting pond surrounded by acres of forest.  The forest has many walking paths which connect the Environmental Interpretive Center, <a>Henry Ford Community College</a>, Downtown West Dearborn, Hines Drive, the University's Main Campus, and Fair Lane together.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>There are four colleges at UM-D: the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL), the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS), the College of Business (COB), and the School of Education (SOE).

<p><a>The College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) </a> offers nine undergraduate degree programs and twelve graduate degree programs, including two doctoral programs.</p>
<p>The college's partnerships with major domestic automobile companies and automotive suppliers have led to many educational opportunities for its students and research for both students and faculty. Regular feedback from its Visiting Committee, composed of industrial leaders, develop lab facilities and design  research projects in the college. An outcome of the industry partnership was the establishment of the Henry W. Patton Center for Engineering Education and Practice. The Center incorporates engineering practice, design, innovation and concepts of manufacturing technology at all levels of engineering education by integrating the teaching environment with the world of practice. <a>thumb|150px|right|Fairlane Center North</a></p>

<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>The University has had several periods of student activism.  Notably, during the construction of Hines Drive, a road cutting through a local parks system, the students protested and halted the construction of Hines Drive through campus.  It was originally intended to connect to Michigan Avenue, but instead stops now at Ford Road.  </p>
<p>In 2007, the University agreed to install foot baths after talks with the Muslim Students' Association, said Terry Gallagher, director of public relations at the campus. Some Muslims ritually wash their feet before praying five times a day.</p>
