<p><strong>National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)</strong> is located on the campus of <a>Michigan State University</a> and is the leading <a>rare isotope</a> research facility in the United States.  Established in 1963, the <a>cyclotron</a> laboratory is the nation&#x2019;s largest nuclear science facility on a university campus. Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and MSU, the NSCL operates two superconducting cyclotrons. The lab&#x2019;s scientists investigate the properties of rare isotopes and <a>nuclear reactions</a>. In nature, these reactions would take place in <a>star</a>s and exploding stellar environments such as <a>novae</a> and <a>supernovae</a>. The K1200 cyclotron is the highest-energy continuous beam accelerator in the world.</p>
<p>Currently, the laboratory's primary goal is to understand the mysteries that reside at the center of <a>atoms</a>, in <a>atomic nuclei</a>. Atomic nuclei are ten thousand times smaller than the atoms they reside in, but they contain nearly all the atom&#x2019;s mass (more than 99.9 percent).</p>
