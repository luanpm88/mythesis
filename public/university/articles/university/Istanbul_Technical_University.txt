<p><strong>Istanbul Technical University</strong> (<strong>ITU</strong>,  commonly referred to as ITU or Technical University) is an international <a>technical university</a> located in <a>Istanbul</a>, <a>Turkey</a>. It is the world's third oldest  <a>technical university</a> dedicated to engineering sciences as well as social sciences recently, and is one of the most prominent educational institutions in Turkey. ITU is ranked 108th worldwide and 1st nationwide in the field of engineering/technology by <a>THES - QS World University Rankings</a> in 2009. University's basketball team, <a>ITUSpor</a>, is in the Turkish Basketball League Division II. The university has 39 undergraduate, 144 graduate programs, 13 colleges, 346 labs and 12 research centers. ITU has 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>  </p>
<h3>Ottoman Empire</h3>
<p>Considered as the world's second institution of higher learning specifically dedicated to engineering education, Istanbul Technical University (ITU) has a long and distinguished history which began in 1773. ITU was founded by Sultan <a>Mustafa III</a> as the <a>&quot;Imperial Naval Engineers' School&quot;</a> () (), and it was originally dedicated to the training of ship builders and cartographers. In 1795 the scope of the school was broadened to train technical military staff for the modernization of the <a>Ottoman</a> army. In 1845 the engineering function of the school was further widened with the addition of a program devoted to the training of architects. The scope and name of the school were extended and changed again in 1883 and in 1909 the school became a public engineering school which was aimed at training civil <a>engineers</a> who could provide the infrastructure for the rapidly developing country.</p>
<h3>Modern Turkey</h3>
<p>By 1928 the institution had gained formal recognition as a university of engineering which provided education in both engineering and architecture. In 1944 the name of the institution was changed to Istanbul Technical University and in 1946 the institution became an autonomous university with <a>architecture</a>, civil, mechanical, and electrical <a>engineering</a> faculties. <a>thumb|250px|Ma&#x00e7;ka Campus in the district of Sisli</a> With its long history of 234 years, its modern teaching environment, and well-qualified teaching staff, Istanbul Technical University today is the personification of the <a>engineering</a> and architectural education in Turkey. Istanbul Technical University not only played a leading role in the modernization movement of the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, but has also maintained its leadership position in the changes and innovations taking place in the construction, industrialization, and technological realms during the modern days of the Turkish Republic. Engineers and architects trained at Istanbul Technical University have played significant roles in the construction of Turkey's <a>highways</a>, <a>bridge</a>s, <a>dams</a>, <a>factories</a>, buildings, energy production plants, communication networks, and in the development of its villages, towns, and cities. Alumni also played a significant role in Turkish politics. Since its establishment in 1773, Istanbul Technical University has managed to keep itself up-to-date by following the technological developments which have occurred worldwide. The university offers its students an educational environment which is rooted in tradition and yet open to the very latest in modern education techniques and settings. By promoting strong international relationships, this public university also offers its students truly universal educational opportunities which are not limited by national boundaries.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> [[Image:ITU Taskisla Campus interior.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Courtyard of Ta&#x015f;k&#x0131;&#x015f;la, the building of [[ITU College of Architecture|School of Architecture]]]] The structure of each &quot;Faculty&quot; at ITU is comparable to those of &quot;colleges&quot; in the U.S. institutions, where each faculty is composed of two or more departments. For example, the Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering consists of the departments of <a>electrical engineering</a>, <a>computer engineering</a>, <a>control engineering</a>, <a>electronics engineering</a> and <a>telecommunications engineering</a>.</p>

<h3>Triga Mark-2 Nuclear Reactor</h3>
<p>ITU's <a>nuclear reactor</a> of Triga Mark-2 is in the Maslak campus. It is located at the Energy Institute. The ITU Lake is the cooler for this reactor.</p>
<h3>Ar&#x0131; Technopolis</h3>
<p>Since the foundation in 2003 <a>Ar&#x0131; Technopolis</a>, where is located at the Ayaza&#x011f;a Campus, provides companies with researching, technology development and production opportunities at the university, in cooperation with the researchers and academicians. The technopolis have two buildings:Ar&#x0131;-1 and Ar&#x0131;-2. Ar&#x0131;-3 building in Maslak and another building in Floria are announced to build. Ar&#x0131; Technopolis has the 49% of export among technopolises in Turkey.</p>
<h3>National High Performance Computing Center</h3>
<p><a>NHPCC</a>, is located at the Ayaza&#x011f;a Campus. It is the national center for high performance computing. The super computer of this center was one of the world's top 500 list super computers (240th).</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Ayaza&#x011f;a Campus, ITU Lake</a></p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Having a suburban campus like Maslak has created the opportunity of building many sports areas. Ayaza&#x011f;a Gymnasium is the center of sports in ITU. Ayaza&#x011f;a Gymnasium also has a stadium with a seating capacity of 3500 for basketball and volleyball matches. A fitness center is also located there.</p>
<p>Basketball matches are among the most important sports activities in ITU. ITU Basketball Team, which won the <a>Turkish Basketball League</a> Championship for 5 times, currently plays in the Turkish Basketball League's 2nd Division (TB2L). Ayaza&#x011f;a Gymnasium is the home of the ITU Basketball Team. Needless to mention that the students are the team's biggest supporters.</p>
<p>Despite the successes in basketball, the football team of ITU plays in the amateur league. A football <a>stadium</a> is also located in Ayaza&#x011f;a, where the football team plays its matches.</p>
<p>Tennis courts and an indoor olympic swimming pool, which is opened in May 2007, are also available in the Ayazaga Campus. An open-air swimming pool serves the ITU faculties.</p>

Also ITU has an option for those who like to organise events and socialise with people from various European countries in the Local <a>Board of European Students of Technology</a> Group which had 40 members in 2007. Despite all these, it can still be a little quiet in the campus from time to time because students can choose the city of <a>Istanbul</a> over the campus life.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>ITU has a capacity of 3000 studeng housings:Lakeside Housings, IMKB Dormitory, Verda Urundul, Ayazaga Dormitory and Gumussuyu dormitory. Additional dormitories are announced to be built.</p>
