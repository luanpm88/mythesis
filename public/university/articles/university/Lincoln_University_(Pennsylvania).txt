<p><strong>Lincoln University</strong> (<strong>LU</strong>) is the United States' first degree-granting <a>historically black university</a>.  It is located near the town of <a>Oxford</a> in southern <a>Chester County</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>. The university also hosts a Center for Graduate Studies in the <a>City of Philadelphia</a>.  Lincoln University provides undergraduate and graduate coursework to approximately 2,500 students.  As former president Dr. <a>Horace Mann Bond</a> noted in his book <em>Education for Freedom: A History of Lincoln University, Pennsylvania</em>, with the college's founding in 1854, &quot;This was the first institution founded anywhere in the world to provide a higher education in the arts and sciences for youth of African descent.&quot;  </p>
<p>Lincoln University has many notable alumni, including <a>Thurgood Marshall</a>, <a>Langston Hughes</a>, <a>Cab Calloway</a>, <a>Horace Mann Bond</a>, <a>Oscar Brown Jr.</a>, <a>Nnamdi Azikiwe</a>, <a>Kwame Nkrumah</a>, and <a>Melvin B. Tolson</a>. </p>
<p>Today, Lincoln University provides a liberal arts and science-based undergraduate core curriculum and select graduate programs to prepare students of every <a>race</a> and nationality. Lincoln is a &quot;<a>state-related</a>&quot; university, meaning it receives public funds and offers reduced tuition for Pennsylvania residents but is under independent control.  </p>
<p>The <em>Lincoln University Urban Center</em> (<em>LUUC</em>) is an extension campus in the <a>University City</a> section of Philadelphia, where <a>Drexel University</a> and <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> are also located. This campus offers Graduate level programs and continuing education.  After the renovation that was started in Fall of 2007 is completed, the Urban Center will be known as <em>Lincoln University Plaza</em>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1854 Rev. <a>John Miller Dickey</a>, a <a>Presbyterian</a> minister, and his wife, Sarah Emlen Cresson, a <a>Quaker</a>, founded Ashmun Institute, later named Lincoln University.  They named it after  <a>Jehudi Ashmun</a>, a religious leader and social reformer.  They founded the school for the education of African Americans, who had few opportunities for higher education.    John Miller Dickey was the first president of the college. He encouraged some of his first students: James Ralston Amos (1826-1864), his brother Thomas Henry Amos (1825-1869), and Armistead Hutchinson Miller (1829/30-1865), to support the establishment of <a>Liberia</a> as a colony for African Americans.  Each of the men became ordained ministers. </p>
<p>In 1866, Ashmun Institute was renamed Lincoln University after the assassination of <a>President</a> <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>.</p>
<p>The college attracted highly talented students from numerous states, especially during the long decades of legal <a>segregation</a> in <a>the South</a>.  As may be seen on the list of notable alumni (link below), many went on to achievements in careers in academia, public service, the arts and many other fields. </p>
<p>In 1945 Dr. <a>Horace Mann Bond</a>, an alumnus of Lincoln, was selected as the first African-American president of the university.  During his 12-year tenure, he continued to do social science research, and helped support the important civil rights case of <em><a>Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>, decided in 1954 by the <a>US Supreme Court</a>.  He established an important relationship with the collector <a>Albert C. Barnes</a>, who ensured Lincoln University had a role in the management of his art collection, the <a>Barnes Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>In 1972 Lincoln University formally associated with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a <a>state-related</a> institution.   </p>
<p>From 1854 to 1954, Lincoln University graduates accounted for 20 percent of Black physicians and over 10 percent of Black lawyers in the United States.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>According to <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>, Lincoln University ranks number 27th out of 81 in the 2009 magazine&#x2019;s first ranking of undergraduate education at HBCUs. It is ranked as a Tier One school on the list.  Lincoln University shares its #27 ranking with <a>Oakwood University</a> and the <a>University of Maryland Eastern Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Lincoln University's &quot;International and Study Abroad Program&quot; had student participation in Service Learning Projects in the countries of Ecuador, Argentina, Spain, Ireland, Costa Rica, Japan, France, Cambodia, Zambia, Liberia, Ghana, Kenya, Russia, Australia, Thailand, the Czech Republic, Mexico, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The new Lincoln-Barnes Visual Arts program is a collaboration between Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation.  It established a Visual Arts program that leads to a Bachelor's of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>Lincoln University offers 37 undergraduate majors, 22 undergraduate minors, and 5 Pre-Professional (Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, and Veterinary Science) programs.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Lincoln University main campus is  with 56 buildings totaling over one million gross square feet. There are fifteen residence halls that accommodate over 1,600 students. The dormitories range from small dorms such as Alumni Hall, built in 1870; and Amos Hall, built in 1902, to the new coed 400-bed apartment-style living (ASL) suites built in 2005.  A $40.5 million, four-story,  Science and General Classroom High Technology Building completed in December 2008.  A $26.1 million  International Cultural Center construction began on April 10, 2008, that is also now completed.</p>
<p>One of the most visible landmarks on campus is the Alumni Memorial Arch, located at the entrance to the university.  The arch was dedicated by President <a>Warren G. Harding</a> in 1921 to the Lincoln men who served in World War I.  The Mary Dod Brown Memorial Chapel is the center for campus religious activities.  This Gothic structure was built in 1890 and contains a 300-seat main auditorium and a 200-seat fellowship hall.</p>

<p>The <a>Langston Hughes</a> Memorial Library (LHML), named after the famous alumnus, houses more than 176,000 volumes, and subscribes to more than 600 current periodicals annually.  A substantial number of the library&#x2019;s periodicals are on microfilm and can be accessed electronically through the school&#x2019;s website.  LHML is equipped with the JSTOR database for online academic proprietary research tools.  JSTOR includes archives of over one thousand leading academic journals across multiple disciplines, as well as selected monographs.  A separate section of the library contains special African-American collections.  This includes the personal papers and artifacts of renowned poet Langston Hughes (class of 1929).</p>

<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Lincoln University participates in the NCAA as a Division II institution. Lincoln has won 17 NCAA Division III Track &amp; Field championships since 1985. Lincoln competes as a Division II member of the <a>Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association</a> and, the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a>. </p>
<p>The Lincoln Lions compete in intercollegiate athletics in the following sports: Baseball, Soccer (Men &amp; Women), Basketball (Men &amp; Women), Volleyball, Indoor Track (Men &amp; Women), Tennis (Men &amp; Women), Tennis (Men &amp; Women), Outdoor Track (Men &amp; Women), Cross-Country (Men &amp; Women), Bowling, Softball, and Football.</p>
<p>The success of the Track and Field program led to the creation of the co-ed athletic fellowship of Track Phi Track at Lincoln in 1981. Some of the requirements include being an All-American and/or striving to become an All-American, meeting and exceeding academic requirements in your major, and participation in Lincoln's Track &amp; Field program for four years.</p>
<p>On , Lincoln's Board of Trustees voted to revive the football program, and establish Marching &amp; Pep Bands. The University has petitioned for membership in the <a>CIAA</a>, of which Lincoln was a founding member.  Lincoln will be moving from the NCAA's Division III to Division II. A club football team is scheduled for the 2008 followed with a full Division II schedule in 2009.  Fielding its first football team in 48 years on August 30, 2008, Lincoln defeated <a>George Mason University</a>, 34-7.  Lincoln lost its final nine games of 2008, but improved to 3-7 in 2009.</p>
<p>The men's basketball team achieved a 46-12 record from 2004- 2006 seasons. The 2005-2006 season witnessed Lincoln's first national basketball ranking, led by &quot;All American&quot;, D3 Hoops &amp; Basketball News &quot;National Player of the Year&quot; Kyle Myricks.  ESPN dubbed him D3's &quot;Most Exciting Player&quot;. The Lions made the sweet sixteen for the first time in school history.</p>
<p>On , Lincoln's basketball team set 5 Division III records in a 201-78 victory over <a>Ohio State Marion</a>. Records included points scored in a half, and points scored in a game, as well as the NCAA record for margin of victory.</p>
<h2>Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation</h2>
<p>As president of Lincoln University (1945-1957), Dr. <a>Horace Mann Bond</a> formed a friendship with <a>Albert Barnes</a>, philanthropist and art collector who established the <a>Barnes Foundation</a>.  Barnes took a special interest in the institution and built a relationship with its students.  In his will Barnes gave Lincoln University the privilege of naming four of the five directors originally defined as the number for the governing board of the <a>Barnes Foundation</a>. The number of directors has since increased in efforts to correct the collection's protracted financial difficulties. This has diluted Lincoln's influence over the valuable collection, now valued at over two billion dollars.</p>
<p>Philanthropist and art collector Albert C. Barnes had an interest in helping underserved youth and populations.  Barnes intended his collection be used primarily as a teaching resource.  He limited the number of people who could view it, and for years even the kinds of people, with a preference for students and working class.  Visitors still must make appointments in advance to see the collection, and only a limited number are allowed in the galleries at one time.  </p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, local government restricted traffic to the current campus, located in a residential neighborhood.  Barnes' constraints, local factors, and management issues pushed the Foundation near bankruptcy by the 1990s. Supporters began to explore plans to move the collection to a more public location and maintain it to museum standards.  To raise money for needed renovations to the main building to protect the collection, the Foundation sent some of the most famous Impressionist and Modern paintings on tour.  </p>
<p>In 2002, the Barnes Foundation contested Albert C. Barnes' <a>will</a>, arguing that the Merion location of the collection and small number of Board members limited the Foundation's ability to sustain itself financially.  <a>Pennsylvania Governor</a> <a>Edward Rendell</a> brokered a settlement in 2005 between the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
<p>[[Image:LangstonHughe_25.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Langston Hughes]]]]  Lincoln University has the distinction of having seven alumni who founded the following colleges and universities in the United States and abroad:  <a>South Carolina State University</a>, Livingstone University, <a>Albany State University</a>, <a>Texas Southern University</a>, Ibibio State College (Nigeria) and the Kwame Nkruma University of Science and Technology (Ghana).</p>
<p>Lincoln University has two alumni being honored with commemorative first-class U.S. Stamps by the United States Postal Service: <a>Thurgood Marshall</a> (BA 1930) and <a>Langston Hughes</a> (BA 1929).</p>
