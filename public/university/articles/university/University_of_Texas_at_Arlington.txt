<p>  <strong>The University of Texas at Arlington</strong> (also referred to as <strong>UT Arlington</strong> or <strong>UTA</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Arlington</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>. The campus is situated around an area to the southwest of downtown Arlington, and is located roughly in the middle of <a>Dallas&#x2013;Fort Worth metropolitan area</a>. The university was founded in 1895 and was primarily a <a>military academy</a> during the early 1900s. After spending several decades in the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>, the university joined <a>The University of Texas System</a> in 1965. In the fall of 2010, UT Arlington reached a student population of 32,956, up 31% from fall 2008, and is currently the second largest institution of the <a>UT System</a>.  The university offers 80 baccalaureate, 74 masters, and 31 doctoral degrees. A 1963 reorganization of the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a> focused on the <a>College Station</a> campus, even though the enrollment at Arlington State College exceeded enrollment at the College Station campus at the time. The decision by the Texas A&amp;M University governing board to focus on the College Station campus led officials of Arlington State College and a number of Arlington citizens to enlist the support of Governor <a>John Connally</a> and key members of the Texas Legislature to separate Arlington State College from the Texas A&amp;M University System and to join <a>The University of Texas System</a>. On April 23, 1965, Arlington State College officially became a part of The University of Texas System. Its name changed in 1967 to The University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
<p>From 1972 until 1991, enrollment grew from 14,028 students to approximately 25,125. Enrollment in the fall of 1998 was 18,662 students. During that same twenty year period, 20 bachelor's degree programs, 23 master's degree programs, and 17 doctoral degree programs were approved. As of the fall of 2009, the enrollment was 28,084 students.</p>
<p>The UT Arlington main campus also sits above the <a>Barnett Shale</a> formation. Natural gas drilling on the campus began in 2008.  UT-Arlington is projected to earn about $25&#x2013;75 million over the next 10 years from gas production. These funds will be used for scholarships, faculty recruitment, and infrastructure upgrades of the campus.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UT Arlington Marching Band</strong>: Known as &quot;The Ambassadors of the University,&quot; the UT Arlington Marching Band is one of the few college marching bands in the nation to exist without a football team. For almost 25 years, the UT Arlington Marching Band has pioneered a new path in musical and visual excellence, striving to provide audiences with state-of-the-art presentations. The band performs annually for crowds numbering 100,000 and is featured in exhibition performances at state and local contests, such as Bands of America and Regional UIL, as well as festivals and high school and professional football games. In 2001, the band performed in exhibition at the Bands of America Grand Nationals Championship, held in Indianapolis, Indiana. The 175 student musicians in the band represent almost all academic disciplines and majors within the University.</li>
  <li><strong>Rubbing Hereford's Head</strong>: Dr. E.H. Hereford was UT Arlington's president from 1946-58. His sculpted likeness still watches over students from its perch in the University Center. Superstition holds that rubbing Dr. Hereford's head gives good luck on exams. This tradition is now <a>carried out online</a> to bring good luck.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Ooozeball</a></strong>: <a>Oozeball</a> is a tradition hosted by the Student Alumni Association and Campus Recreation to raise money for the Student Alumni Association Sophomore Scholarship. Once the amount for the scholarship is reached, all excess funds are donated to charity. In <a>Oozeball</a>, students play volleyball in artificial mud pits. Since its creation in 1989 in the Greek Life community, <a>Oozeball</a> has become one of the most popular student traditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Soaping the fountain</strong>: Occasionally mischievous students will pollute the main UT Arlington fountain at the east end of the flying bridge over Cooper street with soap, causing it to be filled with suds and requiring it to be drained and cleaned. Less often other fountains on campus are subject to the same soap abuse.</li>
  <li><strong>MavsMeet Convocation</strong>: MavsMeet, the New Student Convocation, is a formal assembly commemorating the beginning of the academic year.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|170px|left|Blaze, the UT Arlington Mascot</a> </p>
<p>UT Arlington's athletic teams are known as the Mavericks (the selection was made in 1971 and predated the <a>Dallas Mavericks</a> choice in 1980). UT Arlington fields teams or competitors in 14 NCAA Division I events, including <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>track</a> and <a>volleyball</a>. UT Arlington is a charter member of the <a>Southland Conference</a> and one of two charter members still in the conference.</p>
<p>The University routinely wins conference championships and sends teams to NCAA tournaments. Volleyball achieved the greatest team success of all sports in the history of the university by advancing to the <a>1989 NCAA Volleyball Final Four</a>. The women's basketball team played in the 2005 and 2007 NCAA tournaments; the men's basketball team made its first appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing in the first round against #1 seed <a>Memphis</a>, who was later forced to vacate this and all other wins from the 2007-2008 season.</p>
<p>UT Arlington has won the Southland Conference's Commissioners Cup more times than any other conference team - three times since the award was first instituted in 1998. The Commissioners Cup is awarded to the athletics program with the highest all-around performance in all conference events, including all men's and women's events.</p>
<p>UT Arlington's basketball and volleyball teams play at <a>Texas Hall</a>, which may be one of collegiate athletics' most distinctive facilities.  Texas Hall is a 4,200 seat theater, and the teams play on the theater stage.  Fans can sit either in the theater seats or in bleachers on the stage. In 2005, the University administration proposed a new <a>Special Events Center</a>, including a state of the art arena better designed for basketball and volleyball as well as other university activities. This proposal has been approved, and ground was broken on the Special Events Center on March 5, 2010. The Center is expected to be complete in December 2011 and seat approximately 6,500 people.</p>
<p>UT Arlington fielded a <a>football</a> program, playing out of <a>Maverick Stadium</a>, until 1985 when it disbanded football after the season.  The school administration blamed its decision on major losses, nearly $1 million a year, as well as low average attendance (5,600, the student body at the time was 23,100).  By the end, the program was funded by the university's auxiliary enterprise income while the other 14 sports were under-funded, as football accounted for half the total athletic budget.  In April 2004, UT Arlington students voted by a 2-to-1 margin to increase their student athletic fees by $2 per semester-credit hour should the university reinstate football and begin women's golf and women's soccer teams; however, after review, President James D. Spaniolo dismissed the idea as too costly in terms of time and resources.</p>
