<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Indiana Asbury University was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, Indiana, and was named after <a>Francis Asbury</a>, the first <a>American</a> <a>bishop</a> of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000, equal to around $500,000 in 2007, to entice the Methodists to found the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time.  It was originally established as an all men's school, but began admitting women in 1867.  In 1884 Indiana Asbury University changed its name to DePauw University in honor of <a>Washington C. DePauw</a>, who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the <a>School of Music</a> during 1884.  Before his death in 1887, Mr. DePauw donated over $600,000 to Indiana Asbury, equal to around $13 million in 2007. Sigma Delta Chi, known today as the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a>, was founded at the university in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including <a>Eugene C. Pulliam</a>. The world's first modern-day sorority, <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, was also founded at DePauw in 1870. DePauw is home to the world's first sorority and the longest continually-running fraternity in the world, the Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi.</p>
<h3>DePauw and Liberal Arts Today</h3>
<p>DePauw University has an enrollment of about 2400 students. Students hail from 42 states and 32 countries with a 20.4% multicultural enrollment.

<h3>Greek organizations</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Women were first admitted to Indiana Asbury in 1867. The first Greek letter fraternity for women soon followed. in January 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at DePauw as the world's first Greek letter fraternity known among women. Kappa Kapa Gamma established a chapter at DePauw in 1875. Notably, Alpha Chi Omega  became the second Alpha Chapter established at DePauw, after Theta, when it was founded here in 1885. </p>
<p>Since their founding, DePauw's Greek organizations have placed a strong emphasis on scholarship and philanthropy, while providing important opportunities to socialize and interact with members of DePauw's diverse community through scheduled projects and social gatherings. </p>
<p>Nationally, DePauw's Greek community makes up one of the largest percentages of a college student body.</p>
<h3>Greek Life</h3>
<p>From 2003-2008, DePauw University was ranked #1 in &quot;major <a>fraternity</a> and <a>sorority</a> scene&quot; by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> and has since remained in the top ten. In 2009, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked DePauw as fourth in the nation for highest percentage of Sorority members (75 percent).</p>
<p>The Greek community consists of fourteen national social fraternities (eleven of which have houses on campus) and ten sororities (six of which have houses on campus).  DePauw has an extensive and substantial Greek history, with both <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, the first national sorority for women, and <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a> being founded at the school. Furthermore, the Delta Chapter of <a>Beta Theta Pi</a> is the longest continuously-running social fraternity in North America while the Lambda Chapter is the longest continuing chapter of <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a> as well as the second longest continuously-running social fraternity. </p>
<p>Formal IfC (<a>North-American Interfraternity Conference</a>) and Panhel (<a>National Panhellenic Conference</a>) recruitment for women is held early second semester. Membership intake for <a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a> organizations (historically black Greek-lettered organizations) usually occurs in the fall and/or the spring.  First-year students are not permitted onto sorority property for a period of time at the beginning of each school year.</p>

<h3>Controversy</h3>
<p> In 2006, the national organization of the <a>Delta Zeta</a> sorority reorganized the DePauw chapter, reducing 23 of its 35 current members (including the chapter president) to alumna status and giving them six weeks to vacate the <a>sorority house</a>. Of the 12 remaining members, 6 chose to take alumna status. The Delta Zeta national organization explained that its decisions were based on member commitment, but the evicted members said that they were forced to take alumna status because the chapter members were perceived as physically unattractive and &quot;brainy&quot;. Subsequently, on Monday, March 12, 2007, DePauw President Robert G. Bottoms announced that the University would sever its ties with Delta Zeta's national organization, effective at the end of the 2006-7 academic year.  Bottoms was quoted as saying, &quot;I came to the conclusion that our approaches to these issues are just incompatible.&quot;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> The DePauw Tigers compete in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> (SCAC). Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in <a>American football</a> against its rival <a>Wabash College</a> in what has become the <a>Monon Bell</a> Classic.  The traveling trophy, a 300-pound train bell from the <a>Monon Railroad</a>, made its debut in the rivalry in 1932.  The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation's oldest <a>college football</a> rivalries. </p>
<p>In 1933, head coach <a>Ray &quot;Gaumey&quot; Neal</a> led the DePauw Tigers football team to an unbeaten, untied, and unscored opening season. The Tigers compiled a 7-0-0 record and outscored their opponents 136-0. Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, but DePauw, 5-0-1, finished the season with one scoreless tie and six points allowed in a different game. The only points surrendered that season were in a 39-6 victory over <a>Indiana State</a> and the only non-win was a 0-0 tie against Oberlin. The Tigers outscored their opponents, 206-6.</p>
<p>DePauw has been a member of the <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> since 1997 and has won numerous conference championships, most notably in women's basketball, where the school is a Division III power.  DePauw's program has also won the conference's overall &quot;President's Trophy&quot; three times in that span, the only school besides <a>Trinity</a> to do so.  This includes back-to-back President's Trophies in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007.  In 2007, the Tigers defeated <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a> to win the Division III title in women's basketball.  The women's softball team won the regional title, advancing to the Division III College World Series for the first time in school history.</p>
<p>DePauw University's women's golf program is the best of any NCAA Division III college in the nation for students seeking a &quot;balanced&quot; experience, according to <a>Golf Digest</a>'s third annual College Golf Guide, which appears in the September 2007 issue.</p>
<p>The DePauw University women's basketball team won the Division III National Championship for the 2006-07 year.  They defeated Washington University in Springfield, MA to win the first team national championship in the school's history.  </p>
<p>Over the years, DePauw has sent several players to the <a>NFL</a>, including Dave Finzer '82, a punter for the <a>Chicago Bears</a> and <a>Seattle Seahawks</a>, and Greg Werner '89, a <a>tight end</a> for the <a>New York Jets</a>.</p>

<h3>Monon Bell Classic</h3>
<p> Voted &quot;Indiana's Best <a>College Sports</a> Rivalry&quot; by viewers of <a>ESPN</a> in 2005, DePauw University and <a>Wabash College</a> play each November&#x2014;in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams&#x2014;for the right to keep or reclaim the <a>Monon Bell</a>.  The two teams first met in 1890.  In 1932, the Monon Railroad donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year.  The series is as close as a historic rivalry can be: by virtue of winning the 116th game on November 14, 2009, Wabash leads the all-time series, 55-53-9; since the Monon Bell was introduced, DePauw has a 37-36-6 edge.  The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by <a>ABC</a>, <a>ESPN2</a>, and <a>HDNet</a> (where it has appeared for the past four years, 2006&#x2013;2009).  Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 60 locations around the United States for telecast parties, and a commemorative DVD (including historic clips known as &quot;Monon Memories&quot;) is produced (there are discs of the 1977, 1994 and 2001-2009 games).</p>
<p>In 1999, <a>GQ</a> listed the Monon Bell game as reason #3 on its &quot;50 Reasons Why College Football is Better Than Pro Football&quot; list.</p>
<h3>Little 5 Bike Race</h3>
<p>Held in late April every year, DePauw's Little 5 <a>bike race</a> has been a campus tradition since the first race in 1956. The first race was sponsored by Union Board as a <a>fund raiser</a> for the American Cancer Fund. Fourteen teams of female riders from various living units competed. The race has changed some since 1956. Today, there are women's races, and the race has been moved from the streets around East College to the track at Blackstock Stadium.</p>
<h3>Boulder Run</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Boulder next to East College</a>The Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, <a>streaking</a> from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbia Boulder, located in the center of the campus near the East College building.  Students today perform the Boulder Run for a variety of reasons, though it was originally performed on the day or night of the first snowfall on campus by Phi Kappa Psi, the Greek house nearest the boulder. This tradition was mentioned in <em><a>Playboy magazine</a>'s</em> September 1972 issue. The DePauw police are usually tolerant of the tradition, but students have been ticketed when caught.</p>
<h3>Campus Golf</h3>
<p>It is not unusual to see students playing a game of <a>Campus Golf</a> when the weather is nice.  The game of campus golf requires a <a>golf club</a> and a <a>tennis ball</a>.  Players attempt to hit their <a>golf ball</a> against various targets on campus within a number of strokes. The game is similar to <a>frisbee golf</a>, where players attempt to hit targets ranging from trees to buildings with a frisbee.  </p>
<p>While playing campus golf, students often wear traditional golf attire, including plaid pants, shirts and sweaters.  Many living units have established &quot;courses&quot; which are played by residents.</p>
<h3>Marvin's</h3>
<p>Marvin's is a small restaurant serving mainly <a>American food</a> such as hamburgers and fries. While not part of DePauw's campus dining options, Marvin's is an important part of student culture, employing students and remaining open later than most restaurants in Greencastle. The garlic cheeseburger (commonly referred to by its initialism, GCB) is considered its specialty.  The popularity of Marvin's extended outside the Greencastle community after an obscure reference was made to the restaurant on the television show <em><a>Joan of Arcadia</a></em>.</p>
