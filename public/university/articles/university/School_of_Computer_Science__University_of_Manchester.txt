<p>The <strong>School of Computer Science</strong> at the <a>University of Manchester</a> is the academic department providing the focus for teaching and research in <a>Computer Science</a>. The school has its roots in the <strong>Computer Group</strong> of the Electrical Engineering Department at the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a>. The Computer Group was established following <a>Freddie Williams</a>' move to the Electrical Engineering Department in 1946. At its formation in 1964, the <strong>Department of Computer Science</strong> was the first such department in the <a>United Kingdom</a>. The School was formed from the Department when the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> and <a>UMIST</a> merged to form the <a>University of Manchester</a> in 2004.</p>
