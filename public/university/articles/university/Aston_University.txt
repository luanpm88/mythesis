<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Aston University's main building from the Aston Expressway</a></p>
<p>Aston University was founded in 1895 and granted Royal Charter as Aston University in 1966. Separated from the <a>Birmingham and Midland Institute</a> in 1895 as <em>The Birmingham Municipal Technical School</em>, it changed its name in 1927 to the <em>Birmingham Central Technical College</em>, It officially became the <em>University of Aston in Birmingham</em> on receipt of its <a>Royal Charter</a> on 22 April 1966. Sir Michael Bett took over the position of Chancellor on 21 October 2004 from Sir <a>Adrian Cadbury</a>, whose younger brother <a>Sir Dominic Cadbury</a> is Chancellor of the <a>University of Birmingham</a>. Part of <a>Birmingham City University</a>'s Institute of Art and Design is also located on the edge of the Aston University campus - called its Gosta Green site.</p>
<p>In 1983, Aston University, in partnership with Birmingham City Council and <a>Lloyds Bank</a>, established Birmingham Technology Ltd., which manages the <a>Aston Science Park</a> adjacent to the university site.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The university is situated on a 40-<a>acre</a> (16-<a>hectare</a>) campus at <a>Gosta Green</a>, in the city centre of <a>Birmingham</a>, <a>England</a>.</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>[[Image:Aston arms.jpg|thumb|The Aston University [[coat of arms]]]]</p>
<p>The University's arms were granted on 18 March 1955 by Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms to the Birmingham Corporation, for use by the former College of Technology. They were designed to show the College's connection with the City and with the teaching of technology. The arms consist of a <a>shield</a> and <a>crest</a>. The shield has two sections &#x2013; the field (the main background) which is coloured blue and a chief (the broad band across the top of the shield) of silver. On the field is a diagonal line of five gold diamonds joined one to the other, similar to the first quarter of the Arms of the City of Birmingham and incorporated in the Arms of the College to show its connection with the City. This was adopted by the family of Birmingham which derived its name from the then hamlet of Birmingham, and provided the Lords of the Manor from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. On the chief is depicted an open book bound in red placed between two black hammers, showing the connection of the University with technology, the book representing learning and the hammers engineering and allied trades.</p>
<p>The crest is also designed to stress the pursuit of knowledge. It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel. Having been originally worn on the helmet of a fully-armed person, the crest is always placed on the top of the helm. The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration and, in the University&#x2019;s arms, this is effected by the use of a wreath and a crown. The wreath is silver, red and black, these colours being taken from the shield. It is surmounted by a mural crown (resembling a wall), which is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations. The cloth mantling which hangs down from the top of the helm is the survival of the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour, coloured in the two principal colours of the shield, blue and gold.</p>
<p>The motto of the University is the same as that of the City of Birmingham: &quot;Forward&quot;.</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Part of the Lakeside student residences</a> <a>thumb|right|Two of the three 1970s student halls of residence.</a> Aston University has both standard (shared bathroom) and en-suite accommodation on campus - 2,300 rooms in total of which 85% are ensuite. All campus accommodation is less than five minutes' walk from the main building, and approximately five minutes' walk from Birmingham city centre. In the 1970s, three towers containing student accommodation were constructed on the Aston University campus; Dalton, Lawrence and Stafford Towers. Stafford Tower has two flats per floor, each with nine single study bedrooms sharing a large kitchen and bathroom. Lawrence and Dalton Towers are due to be demilished during 2011. Aston University has an accommodation guarantee in place for first year students - details in the Aston University prospectus.</p>
<p>A more recent addition to the Aston University student dwelling stock is the Lakeside complex on campus. Completed in August 1999, it cost &#x00a3;14,240,000 and has flats for approximately 650 students. The building won the Best Public Building award at the 2001 Brick Development Association Awards.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2007, Aston University submitted a planning application for demolition of the three 1970s towers and to replace them with new student accommodation blocks as well as apartments for tutors, retail units and administrative offices. On July 5, 2007, the application was approved and work commenced in January 2008 on phase 1. This is due for completion in 2010 and will consist of two blocks of student accommodation and a car park to the rear. There is also a new artificial sports pitch with another car park beneath. The demolition of the existing towers will take place for phases 2 and 3. The entire scheme is due for completion in 2014. Upon completion there will be 2,345 bedrooms in the development alone, with 650 more rooms provided at other halls such as Lakeside. All the new accommodation is to be en-suite but rooms/flats will be differentiated in terms of size and facilities in-order to provide students with a range of different priced rooms. The Aston Student Village project will cost an estimated &#x00a3;215 million. Phase 1 is costing &#x00a3;57 million. Start on site date was 30/10/2008 and opened in September 2010 ready for the new term. Phase 1 buildings consist of two sections at a max height of 18 storeys with 7 and 5 ensuite bedroom apartments sharing a spacious kitchen.</p>
