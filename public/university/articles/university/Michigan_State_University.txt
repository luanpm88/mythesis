<p> </p>
<p><strong>Michigan State University</strong> (<strong>MSU</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research university in <a>East Lansing</a>, <a>Michigan</a> USA. Founded in 1855, it was the pioneer <a>land-grant institution</a> and served as a model for future land-grant colleges in the United States under the 1862 <a>Morrill Act</a>.</p>
<p>MSU pioneered the studies of <a>packaging</a>, <a>hospitality business</a>, <a>telecommunication</a>, and <a>music therapy</a>. Today its <a>study-abroad</a> program is the largest of any single-campus university in the country, offering more than 200 programs in more than 60 countries on all continents including <a>Antarctica</a>.</p>
<p>It is considered to be one of America's <a>Public Ivy</a> universities, which recognizes top public research universities in the United States.  Following the introduction of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, the college became <a>coeducation</a>al and expanded its curriculum beyond <a>agriculture</a>. After World War II, the number of students tripled as the institution became a major university. Today, MSU is the <a>ninth-largest university</a> in the United States, with 47,131 students and 2,954 <a>faculty</a> members.  The school's  <a>nuclear physics</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>political science</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>journalism</a> and <a>osteopathic medicine</a> programs are among the nation's best.  </p>
<p>MSU's <a>Division I</a> sports teams are called the <a>Spartans</a>. They compete in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> in all sports except ice hockey, in which the team is part of the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>. MSU's <a>football</a> <a>team</a> won the <a>Rose Bowl</a> in 1954, 1956, and 1988 and boasts six national championships. Its men's basketball team won the <a>NCAA National Championship</a> in 1979 and 2000 while currently enjoying a streak of six <a>Final Four</a> appearances in the last 12 seasons. MSU men's <a>ice hockey</a> has won <a>national titles</a> in 1966, 1986, and 2007. Cross Country has historically been Michigan State's most successful sport; especially during a four-decade period spanning roughly 1930-1970 during which the Spartans won eight NCAA championships and numerous other conference and national titles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Agriculture school</h3>
<p>[[Image:Beaumont Tower 10 2007 BR.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beaumont Tower]] marks the site of <a>College Hall</a>.]] The <a>Michigan Constitution</a> of 1850 called for the creation of an &quot;agricultural school&quot;, though it was not until February 12, 1855 that Michigan <a>Governor</a> <a>Kinsley S. Bingham</a> signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan. Classes began on May 13, 1857 with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students. The first president, <a>Joseph R. Williams</a>, designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced <a>science</a>, <a>liberal arts</a>, and practical training. The curriculum excluded <a>Latin</a> and <a>Greek</a> studies, since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily <a>manual labor</a>, which kept costs down for both the students and the College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as <a>elitist</a>. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.</p>
<h3>Land Grant pioneer</h3>
<p>In 1860, <a>Joseph R. Williams</a> became acting <a>lieutenant governor</a> and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the College a four-year curriculum and the power to grant <a>master's degree</a>s. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution. and two years later the college officially changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.). &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Hannah statue.jpg|thumb|left|As part of its sesquicentennial celebration, MSU erected this 7-foot (2.1 m) bronze statue of [[John A. Hannah]], sculpted by California artist Bruce Wolfe. ]] --&gt;</p>
<h3>Big Ten university</h3>
<p>During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough that it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941 the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, <a>John A. Hannah</a>, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 <a>G.I. Bill</a>, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965. In 1957 Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University&#x2013;Oakland, now <a>Oakland University</a>, with <a>Matilda Dodge Wilson</a>.  Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the <a>University of Chicago</a> resigned from the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> in 1946. Hannah lobbied hard to take its place, gaining admission in 1949. Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science. Nine years after that, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan allowed the University to drop the words &quot;Agriculture and Applied Science&quot; from its name. Since 1964 the institution has gone by the name of Michigan State University.</p>
<h3>Global leader by 2012</h3>
<p>[[Image:MSU Cyclotron.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]] features one of the most powerful instruments of its type in the world.]] Since the end of the Hannah era, Michigan State has shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, current president <a>Lou Anna Simon</a> called for MSU, one of the <a>public ivy institutions</a>, to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by the year 2012. Her plans include creating a new <a>residential college</a> and increasing grants awarded from the <a>National Institutes of Health</a> past the <a>$</a>100 million mark. While there are over 100 <a>Land-grant universities</a> in the United States, she has stated that she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.</p>
<p>Michigan State recently joined the <a>University of Michigan</a> and <a>Wayne State University</a> to create the <a>University Research Corridor</a>. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive further collaboration.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|MSU's main campus lies north of the CN Railway and south of Michigan and Grand River Avenues.</a> MSU's sprawling campus is located in East Lansing, Michigan. The campus is perched on the banks of the <a>Red Cedar River</a>. Development of the campus started in 1856 with three buildings: a multipurpose building called <a>College Hall</a>, a dormitory later called &quot;<a>Saints' Rest</a>&quot;, and a barn. Today, MSU's contiguous campus consists of ,  of which are developed. There are 556 buildings: 100 for academics, 131 for <a>agriculture</a>, 166 for housing and <a>food service</a>, and 42 for athletics. Overall, the university has  of total indoor space. Connecting it all is  of roads and  of sidewalks. MSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling  in 28 different counties. <a>left|thumb|Morrill Hall is amongst the oldest structures still standing on campus.</a></p>
<h3>North campus</h3>
<p>The oldest part of campus lies on the north bank of the Red Cedar.</p>
<p>It includes <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture, plentiful trees, and curving roads with few straight lines. It was in this area that the College built its first three buildings, of which none survive. Other historic buildings north of the river include <a>Cowles House</a>, the president's official residence, and <a>Beaumont Tower</a>, a <a>carillon</a> clock tower marking the site of <a>College Hall</a>, the original classroom building. To the east lies <a>Eustace&#x2013;Cole Hall</a>, America's first freestanding laboratory for <a>horticulture</a>. Other landmarks include the bronze statue of former president <a>John A. Hannah</a>, the <a>W. J. Beal Botanical Garden</a>, and the painted boulder known as &quot;<a>The Rock</a>&quot;, which is a popular spot for theatre, <a>tailgating</a>, and candlelight vigils. On the northwest corner of campus lies the University's hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center. The university also has a museum, initiated in 1857. MSU Museum is one of the oldest museums in the Midwest and is accredited by the American Association of Museums.</p>
<h3>South campus</h3>
<p>[[Image:MSU Wharton Center.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wharton Center for Performing Arts]] hosts many productions throughout the year and was host to the final US Presidential Debate before the 1992 election.]] &lt;br&gt; The campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II <a>International Style</a> buildings with sparse foliage, relatively straight roadways, and numerous parking lots. The &quot;2020 Vision&quot; Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with <a>parking ramps</a> and green space, but these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the University erected a new bronze statue of <em><a>The Spartan</a></em> in 2005. This replica replaced the original <a>modernist</a> <a>terra cotta</a> statue, which can still be seen inside <a>Spartan Stadium</a>. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the <a>Cyclotron</a> and the <a>College of Law</a>.</p>
<p>This part of campus is home to the <a>MSU Horticulture Gardens</a> and the adjoining <a>4-H</a> Children's Garden. South of the gardens lie the <a>Canadian National</a> and <a>CSX</a> railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university's agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Diagnostics Center for Population and Animal Health. <img></p>
<h3>Dubai Education Center</h3>
<p>In 2008, Michigan State University established an education center in <a>Dubai</a>, <a>United Arab Emirates</a>. MSU Dubai was the first American university with a presence in <a>Dubai International Academic City</a>, with classes beginning in August 2008. The University offered six undergraduate programs: Business Administration; Child and Youth Development; Construction Project Management; Early Childhood Education; Media Management and Research; Computer Engineering, which later was changed to Electrical and Computer Engineering; and a Master's Degree in Human Resources &amp; Labor Relations. The University attracted over 100 students from all over the Middle East and beyond. After two years of activity, MSU shut down all undergraduate programs in Dubai due to financial reasons. The Dubai campus remains as a research site, a Study Abroad center, and for its dozen graduate students.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>  [[Image:MSU Library 1.jpg|thumb|&#x3163;left|[[Michigan State University Libraries|The MSU Library]] is located on the oldest part of campus between <a>Beaumont Tower</a> and the river.]] MSU has the <a>ninth largest</a> student body in the U.S. For the fiscal year of 2009&#x2013;10, the Office of the Registrar conferred 11,140 degrees. The student body is 55% female and 45% male. While 89% of students come from all 83 counties in the State of Michigan, also represented are all 50 states in the U.S. and about 125 other countries. Listed as a <a>Public Ivy</a>, Michigan State is a member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>. Michigan State University <a>Ombudsman</a> is the longest continually operating ombudsman office at a college or university in the country. <a>Albert Fert</a>, an <a>Adjunct professor</a> at MSU, was awarded the 2007 <a>Nobel Prize in Physics</a> together with <a>Peter Gr&#x00fc;nberg</a>. MSU's <a>study abroad</a> program is the largest of any single-campus university in the United States with 2,461 students studying abroad in 2004&#x2013;2005 in over 60 countries on all continents, including <a>Antarctica</a>.  MSU has six faculty members elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS); Martin Bukovac (1983), James Dye (1989), Pamela Fraker (2007), Richard Lenski (2006), Michael Thomashow (2003), and James Tiedje (2003).</p>
<p>Its admissions are moderately difficult; for 2009's entering class, the 25th/75th percentiles for the SAT were 1030 and 1240/1600, and its 25th/75th percentiles on the ACT were 23 and 27/36.</em></p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> Michigan State ranks 80th in the world, according to a <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> study, which measures scientific research leading towards a <a>Nobel Prize</a>. <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranks MSU 79th in the U.S. &lt;br&gt;The university has over 200 academic programs. <em>U.S. News</em> has ranked MSU's graduate-level <a>elementary education</a>&quot;, <a>secondary education</a>, and <a>Industrial and Organizational Psychology</a> programs No.1 for the last 14 years. The National Communication Association (NCA) ranks MSU&#x2019;s Ph.D. programs as No. 1 in educating researchers in the rapidly growing fields of health communication and communication technology. &lt;br&gt; MSU is also ranked number four in several other fields, including international/intercultural communication, mass communication, and interpersonal communication. Based on the November 2004 NCA report:</p>
<p>The Eli Broad College of Business was ranked No. 9 among public institutions and No. 20 nationally in 2010 by <em>Business Week</em>. The 2008 <em>U.S. News</em> ranked Michigan State's <a>Supply Chain Management</a> program in the Eli Broad College of Business No.1 in the nation for the second year in a row. In addition, the accounting program in the Eli Broad College of Business ranked 8th in both Undergraduate and Graduate school nationally according to <em>Public Accounting Report</em>.</p>
<p>MSU&#x2019;s graduate program in <a>nuclear physics</a> is ranked No. 1 in the nation by U.S. News.

The Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Michigan State with an overall grade of &quot;B&quot; on the 2009 Campus Sustainability Survey, including &quot;A&quot;s in the categories of Administration, Transportation, Endowment Transparency, and Investment Policies.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>[[Image:MSU Computer Center.jpg|thumb|The Computer Center once housed the early research computer [[MISTIC]]]] The university spent nearly <a>$</a>405 million in 2008-09 on research, and a <a>particle accelerator</a> called the <a>National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory</a>. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as the site for the <a>Facility for Rare Isotope Beams</a> (FRIB). The $550 million facility will attract top researchers from around the world to conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields. <a>thumb|right|The Veterinary Research Farm.</a></p>
<p>In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element <a>germanium</a>, called Ge-60 In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> and the government of <a>Brazil</a>, broke ground on the 4.1-meter <a>Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope</a> (SOAR) in the <a>Andes Mountains</a> of <a>Chile</a>. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics &amp; Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of another consortium called the <a>Michigan Life Sciences Corridor</a>, which aims to develop <a>biotechnology</a> research in the State of Michigan. Finally, the College of Communication Arts and Sciences' <a>Quello Center</a> researches current issues of information and communication management.</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) <a>endowment</a> started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate <a>R.E. Olds</a> helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000. There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds. That changed dramatically in the early 2000s, when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of <a>fiscal year</a> 2004&#x2013;2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase in the size of the endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.</p>
<h2>Colleges</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The South Campus skyline</a> MSU has over 200 academic programs offered by 17 degree granting colleges. MSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has three residential colleges, including the recent opening of the <a>Residential College in Arts &amp; Humanities</a> (RCAH) located in Snyder and Phillips halls.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Established in 1967, <a>James Madison College</a> is a smaller component residential college in <a>political science</a> housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are <a>tenure</a> track faculty. James Madison College has about 1150 students total, with each <a>freshman</a> class containing about 320 students. Each of Madison's four <a>majors</a>&#x2014;Social Relations and Policy, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Comparative Cultures and Politics&#x2014;requires two years of foreign language and one semester of &quot;field experience&#x201d; in an <a>intern</a>ship or study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU&#x2019;s <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> members.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Snyder-Phillips Hall was built in 1947. The building was recently expanded to make room for a new residential college.</a></p>
<p>Also established in 1967, <a>Lyman Briggs College</a> teaches math and science within social, historical and philosophical contexts. Many Lyman Briggs students intend to pursue careers in medicine, but the school supports over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences. Lyman Briggs is one of the few colleges that lets undergraduates teach as &quot;Learning Assistants.&quot;</p>
<p>MSU's newest residential college is the <a>Residential College in Arts &amp; Humanities</a>. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 <a>undergraduates</a> with an individualized <a>curriculum</a> in the <a>liberal</a>, <a>visual</a> and <a>performing arts</a>. Though all the students will graduate with the same <a>degree</a>, MSU encourages students in the college to get a <a>second degree</a> or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College. <a>thumb|The MSU Law School Building</a></p>
<h3>Professional schools</h3>
<p>The <a>Michigan State University College of Law</a> is a <a>private</a> law school within a <a>public</a> institution. Founded in Detroit in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, the law school moved to East Lansing in 1995 becoming an integral part of the university. Students attending MSU College of Law come from 42 states and 13 countries. The law school publishes the Michigan State Law Review, the Michigan State Journal of International Law and the Journal of Medicine and Law. The College of Law is the home of the <a>Geoffrey Fieger</a> Trial Practice Institute, the first trial practice institute in the United States. The <a>Intellectual Property</a> and Communications Law program is ranked seventeenth nationally.</p>
<p>The <a>Eli Broad College of Business</a> has programs in <a>accounting</a>, <a>information systems</a>, <a>finance</a>, <a>management</a>, <a>marketing</a> and <a>supply chain management</a>, and <a>hospitality business</a>. The school has 4,775 <a>undergraduate</a> students and 776 <a>graduate students</a>. The Eli Broad Graduate School of Management, which <em><a>Business Week</a></em> magazine ranks 11th among public institutions, offers three <a>MBA</a> programs, as well as <a>joint degrees</a> with the <a>College of Law</a>. The opening of the <a>Eugene C. Eppley Center for Graduate Studies in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management</a> brought the first program in the United States to offer a Master of Business Administration degree in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management to MSU.</p>
<p>The <a>Michigan State University College of Nursing</a> grants <a>B.S.N.</a>, <a>M.S.N.</a>, and <a>Ph.D.</a> degrees.</p>
<h3>Medical schools</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|MSU Secchia Center</a> The <a>MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> was the world's first publicly funded college of <a>osteopathic medicine</a>. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice &#x2013; more than two-thirds of the college&#x2019;s graduates remain to practice in Michigan. Recently, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in <a>southeast Michigan</a>, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician <a>shortage</a>. &lt;br&gt; According to U.S. News &amp; World Report, the College of Osteopathic Medicine (DO degree) ranked No.8 medical schools in the country for primary care and the College of Human Medicine (MD degree) has regularly ranked among the top thirty medical schools in the country for primary care.</p>
<p>The <a>College of Human Medicine</a> graduates students with medical doctor <a>MD</a> degrees and is split into seven distinct campuses located in <a>Lansing</a>, <a>Kalamazoo</a>, <a>Flint</a>, <a>Saginaw</a>, <a>Marquette</a>, <a>Traverse City</a>, and <a>Grand Rapids</a>. Each campus is affiliated with local hospitals and other medical facilities professionals in the area. For example, the Lansing campus includes <a>Sparrow Hospital</a> and <a>Ingham Regional Medical Center</a>. The College of Human Medicine has recently gained attention for its expansion into the Grand Rapids area, with the new <a>Secchia Center</a> completed in the Fall of 2010, that is expected to fuel the growing medical industry in that region.</p>
<p>Though Michigan State has offered courses in veterinary science since its founding, the <a>College of Veterinary Medicine</a> was not formally established as a four-year, degree-granting program until 1910. Ranked ninth in the nation,</p>
<h3>Other academic units</h3>
<p>In recent years, MSU's music program has grown substantially. Music major enrollment increased more than 97% between 1991 and 2004. In early 2007, this growth led the university board of trustees to spin the music program off into its own college unit: The MSU College of Music. The new college faces many new challenges, such as working with limited space and funding. Nevertheless, MSU's music college plans on continued success, placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions. The college has had high-ranked programs in elementary, In addition, Michigan State ties the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</a> for the top spot in <a>rehabilitation counseling</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, the <a>MSU Honors College</a> provides individualized curricula to MSU's top undergraduate students. Though the college has no majors of its own, it has its own <a>dean</a> and academic advisers to help Honors students with their educational pursuits. <a>High school</a> students starting at MSU may join the Honors College if they are in the top 5% of their high school graduating class and have either an <a>ACT</a> score of at least 30 or an <a>SAT</a> total score of at least 1360. Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.20 GPA and complete eight approved honors courses in order to graduate with Honors College designation on their degree.</p>
<p>After three years of planning, <a>The College of Engineering</a> successfully launched the first stages of its Residential Experience for Spartan Engineering, formally known as the Residential Option for Scientists and Engineers (ROSES), the new program is located in Wilson Hall after being housed in Bailey Hall for a number of years. The Residential program essentially combines with a brand new academic component, Cornerstone Engineering, where freshman engineering students not only get an overview of the engineering field(s) but get a hands-on experience along with it. <a>Global Engineering</a> is a new subject that is of certain interest for not only the Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs but for the entire <a>College of Engineering</a> at MSU. <a>Engineering</a> in today's society has  shown to have a monumental impact on the global economy due to advancements in education, interdependence on economics with infrastructure, computers, transportation, technology and other <a>manufactured goods</a> as well as Michigan State University's <a>study-abroad</a> program being ranked #1 in the nation, allowing for students to experience education and learn cultures in hundreds of countries.  Also of note is the innovative <a>Visiting International Professional Program</a>, which connects professional education to the expertise of Michigan State University, a world leader in global research and leadership training. VIPP creates practical links between the world-class faculty at MSU and global industries, businesses, governments and societies. The newly established Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs for <a>College of Engineering</a> have started programs abroad for more courses in engineering including <a>Study abroad</a> <a>seminars</a>.</p>
<p>MSU currently offers a 30 credit graduate program for Masters in Educational Technology in 3 different formats; completely online, hybrid in East Lansing, Michigan, or overseas. <a>MSU.edu</a> The overseas program is offered at universities around the world.  Past locations have included England, France, Switzerland and Thailand.  The program lasts one month a summer for three summers, with each summer covering 9 credit hours. One online class is required between the second and third summer. The classes are focused on preparing teachers in integrating technology into their classrooms and helping them understand the affordances and constraints of using different programs. The courses are taught by MSU professors and are open to students around the world.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Michigan State's <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I-A</a> program offers 12 <a>varsity</a> sports for men and 13 for women. Hollis replaced <a>Ron Mason</a>, who served as head hockey coach from 1979 to 2002, retiring with a record total of 924 wins, and a 635&#x2013;270&#x2013;69 record at MSU.</p>
<p>Michigan State is among only sixteen Division 1A programs to win multiple national titles in football, and the only school to win multiple national titles in football, basketball, and hockey (MSU was the first athletic program to win multiple national titles in both football and basketball). MSU has won all of its football championships playing only division 1A opponents. The Spartans have participated in two events, in basketball and ice hockey, which have set world records for spectator attendances for both sports.</p>
<p>In 1888 Michigan State University (then as known as Michigan Agricultural College) along with Olivet, Albion and Hillsdale Colleges was a founding member of the nation's oldest athletic conference, the <a>Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association</a> (MIAA). MAC left the conference in 1907.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> [[Image:SpartanStadium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]] hosts varsity <a>football</a> games and other events.]] <a>Football</a> has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896. MSU football teams won the <a>Rose Bowl</a> in 1954, 1956, and 1988. The Spartans accounted for four of the top eight selections in the <a>1967 NFL Draft</a>, the only time a college football program has accomplished such a feat.</p>
<p>Today, the football team competes in <a>Spartan Stadium</a>, a renovated 75,005 seat football stadium near the center of campus. The current coach is <a>Mark Dantonio</a>, who was hired on November 27, 2006. Dantonio had an 18&#x2013;17 record in his three year tenure at the <a>University of Cincinnati</a>, including a 1&#x2013;0 Bowl Game record. He led the team in its first season to a 7&#x2013;6 record. The Spartans played in the Champs Sports Bowl against Boston College on December 28, 2007 and the Capital One Bowl against Georgia on January 1, 2009. MSU's traditional archrival is the <a>University of Michigan</a>, against whom they compete annually for the <a>Paul Bunyan Trophy</a>. Michigan State is one of three Big Ten teams to have an annual non-conference football game against <a>Notre Dame</a>. MSU's record against the Fighting Irish is 25&#x2013;44&#x2013;1 but the Spartans have had much success against the Irish recently, becoming the first team ever to win six straight games at Notre Dame Stadium.</p>

<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>MSU's men's basketball team has won the <a>National Championship</a> twice: in 1979 and again in 2000. In 1979, <a>Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson</a>, along with <a>Greg Kelser</a>, <a>Jay Vincent</a>, and Mike Brkovich, led the MSU team to a 75&#x2013;64 win against the <a>Larry Bird</a>-led <a>Indiana State</a> Sycamores. In 2000, three players from <a>Flint, Michigan</a>, <a>Morris Peterson</a>, <a>Charlie Bell</a>, and <a>Mateen Cleaves</a> led the team to its second national title. Dubbed the &quot;Flintstones&quot;, they were the key to the Spartans' win against the <a>University of Florida</a>. On December 13, 2003, Michigan State and <a>Kentucky</a> played in the <em><a>Basketbowl</a></em>, in which a record crowd of 78,129 watched the game in <a>Detroit</a>&#x2019;s <a>Ford Field</a>. Kentucky won 79&#x2013;74. The basketball team currently plays at the <a>Jack Breslin Student Events Center</a> under head coach <a>Tom Izzo</a>, who has a 336-137 record. The student spirit section at Breslin is called the <a>Izzone</a>. Izzo's coaching has helped the team make six <a>Final Four</a>s since 1999, winning the title in 2000, and thirteen consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (beginning in 1998). In 2009 the Spartans made it to the National Championship game and lost 89-72 to North Carolina.</p>
<h3>Men's ice hockey</h3>
<p>[[Image:MSU Munn Ice Arena.jpg|thumb|right|[[Munn Ice Arena]] was named for former <a>football</a> coach Clarence L. &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn.]]   The Michigan State University men's <a>ice hockey</a> team started in 1924, though it has only been a varsity sport since 1950. The team has since won national titles in 1966, 1986, and 2007. The Spartans came close to repeating the national title in 1987, but lost the championship game to the <a>University of North Dakota</a>. They play at MSU's <a>Munn Ice Arena</a>. Former head coach Ron Mason is college hockey's winningest coach with 924 wins total and 635 at MSU. Since the Big Ten Conference does not include Division I men's <a>ice hockey</a>, Michigan State competes in the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>. Michigan State leads the CCHA in all-time wins, is second in CCHA Conference championships with 7, and is first in CCHA Tournament Championships with 11. Along with the <a>University of Michigan</a> (U-M) and the <a>Ohio State University</a>, it is one of three Big Ten schools in the CCHA. As with other sports, the hockey rivalry between MSU and U-M is a fierce one, and on October 6, 2001, MSU faced U-M in the <a>Cold War</a>, during which a world record crowd of 74,554 packed <a>Spartan Stadium</a> to watch the game end in a 3&#x2013;3 tie. In the 2006&#x2013;2007 season, the Men's Ice Hockey team defeated <a>Boston College</a> for its third <a>NCAA</a> hockey championship.</p>
<h3>Men's cross country</h3>
<p> Between WWI and WWII, Michigan State College competed in the Central Collegiate Conference, winning titles in 1926-1929, 1932, 1933, and 1935. Michigan State also experienced success in the IC4A, at New York&#x2019;s Van Cortland Park, winning 15 team titles (1933&#x2013;1937, 1949, 1953, 1956&#x2013;1960, 1962, 1963, and 1968). Since entering the Big Ten in 1950, Michigan State has won 14 men&#x2019;s team titles (1951&#x2013;1953, 1955&#x2013;1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1970 and 1971). Michigan State hosted the inaugural NCAA cross country championships in 1938 and every year thereafter through 1964 (there was no championship in 1943). The Spartans won NCAA championships in 1939, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1955, 1956, 1958, and 1959.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Hubbard Hall panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|Hubbard Hall is a twelve-story [[residence hall]] on the eastern edge of campus. It is MSU's second tallest building, surpassed by <a>Spartan Stadium</a>]] East Lansing is very much a <a>college town</a>, with 60.2% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest <a>residence hall</a> system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 <a>undergraduate halls</a>, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the <a>Residence Halls Association</a>. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complimented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a <a>co-op</a>. [[Image:MSU Union.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Michigan State University Student Union|MSU Union]], designed by <a>Pond and Pond</a> is home to many events on campus.]]</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p> With over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's <a>Greek Community</a> is one of the largest in the nation. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho Fraternity, and Alpha Phi Sorority; the MSU Greek system now consists of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils, National Panhellenic Council, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council, is made up of 9 organizations, 5 Fraternities and 4 Sororities, that were founded on Historically Black College and Universities HBCU's. The <a>Interfraternity Council</a> and the <a>Women's Panhellenic Council</a> are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many <a>philanthropy</a> events and community fundraisers. For example, in March 2008 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $208,000 for the <a>American Cancer Society</a>, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the <a>Special Olympics</a>.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Student Services Building houses the MSU Department of Student Life, as well as ASMSU and the Greek governing councils.</a> The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the <a>undergraduate</a> <a>student government</a> of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst <a>university</a> <a>student governments</a> for its <a>decentralized</a> bicameral structure, and the relatively non-existent influence of the Greek system. ASMSU representatives are <a>nonpartisan</a> and many are elected in noncompetitive races.</p>
<p>Students pay $16.75 per semester to fund the functions of the ASMSU, including stipends for the organization's officers and activities throughout the year. Some students have criticized ASMSU for not having enough electoral participation to gain a student mandate. <a>Turnout</a> since 2001 has hovered between 3 and 17 percent, with the 2006 election bringing out 8% of the undergraduate student body.</p>
<p>Student-run organizations beyond student government also have a large impact on the East Lansing/Michigan State University community. One example is the <a>Tower Guard</a> honor society. Tower Guard is the oldest and one of the most respected student organizations on campus </p>
<p>The Eli Broad College of Business includes 27 student organizations. The three largest organizations are the Finance Association (FA), the Accounting Student Association (ASA), and the Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA). The SCMA is the host of the university's largest major specific career fair. The fair attracts over 100 companies and over 400 students each year.</p>
<h3>Activism</h3>
<p><a>Activists</a> have played a significant role in MSU history. During the height of the <a>Vietnam War</a>, student protests helped create <a>co-ed</a> residence halls, and blocked the routing of <a>Interstate 496</a> through campus.  In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the University to <a>divest</a> the stocks of companies doing business in <a>apartheid</a> <a>South Africa</a> from its endowment portfolio, such as <a>Coca-Cola</a>.  MSU has many student groups focused on political change. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council of Graduate Students. Michigan State also has a variety of partisan groups ranging from <a>liberal</a> to <a>conservative</a>, including the <a>College Republicans</a>, the <a>College Democrats</a> and several <a>third party</a> organizations. Other partisan activist groups include <a>Young Americans for Freedom</a> and <a>Young Americans for Liberty</a> on the right; <a>Young Democratic Socialists</a>, Students for Economic Justice, <a>Young Communist League</a> and <em><a>MEChA</a></em> on the left. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of <a>Lansing</a>, many politically inclined Spartans intern for state representatives.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The MSU Office of Sustainability works with the University Committee for a Sustainable Campus to &quot;foster a collaborative learning culture that leads the community to heightened awareness of its environmental impact.&quot;  The University is a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the world&#x2019;s first greenhouse gas emission registry, and boasts the lowest electrical consumption per square foot among [[Big Ten]] universities. The University has set a goal of reducing energy use by 15%, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, reducing landfill waste by 30% by 2015.</pre>
<p>The university has also pledged to meet <a>LEED</a>-certification standards for all new construction. In July 2009, the University completed construction of a $13.3 million recycling center, and hopes to double their 2008 recycling rate of 14% by 2010. </pre>
<p>The Environmental Steward&#x2019;s program support&#x2019;s President Simon&#x2019;s &quot;Boldness by Design&quot; strategic vision to transform environmental stewardship on campus within the seven year time frame.  Environmental stewards promote environmental changes among co-workers and peers, be points of contact for their department for environment-related concerns, and be liaisons between the Be Spartan Green Team and buildings.</pre>
<p>The Student Organic Farm is a student-run, four-season farm, which teaches the principals of organic farming and through a certificate program and <a>community supported agriculture</a> (CSA) on ten acres on the MSU campus.</pre>
<p>The certificate program consists of year round crop production, course work in organic farming, practical training and management, and an off-site internship requirement.</pre>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>[[Image:MSU Bronze Sparty 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2005 bronze replica of &quot;The Spartan&quot; (nicknamed &quot;[[Sparty]]&quot;) replaces Leonard D. Jungwirth's <a>modernist</a> original.]] MSU has a variety of campus media outlets. The student-run newspaper is called <em><a>The State News</a></em> and free copies of the paper are available online or at East Lansing newsstands. The paper prints 28,500 copies of the paper Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and 15,000 copies Monday through Friday during the summer. The paper is not published on weekends, holidays, or semester breaks. The campus <a>yearbook</a> is called the </em>Red Cedar Log<em>. </em>Red Cedar Review<em>, Michigan State University's premier literary digest for over forty years, is the longest running undergraduate-run literary journal in the United States. It is published annually by the <a>Michigan State University Press</a>.</em></p>
<p>MSU also publishes a student-run magazine during the academic year called Ing Magazine.  Created in 2007 by MSU alumnus Adam Grant,  the publication is released at the beginning of each month and currently publishes 7 issues each school year. </p>
<p>Electronic media include three radio stations and one <a>public television</a> station, as well as <a>student-produced</a> television shows. MSU's <a>Public Broadcasting Service</a> affiliate, <a>WKAR-TV</a>, the station is the second-oldest educational television station in the United States, and the oldest east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. Besides broadcasting PBS shows, WKAR-TV produces its own local programming, such as a high school <a>quiz bowl</a> show called &quot;QuizBusters&quot;. In addition, MSU has three radio stations; WKAR-AM plays <a>National Public Radio</a>'s talk radio programming, whereas WKAR-FM focuses mostly on classical music programming. Michigan State's student-run radio station, <a>WDBM</a>, broadcasts mostly alternative music during weekdays, and electric music programming nights and weekends. <a>thumb|left|upright|MSU's campus is heavily forested. This trail runs behind several residence halls, including Owen Hall, McDonel Hall, and Holmes Hall.</a></p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p> The current president of the University is <a>Lou Anna Simon</a> who took over on January 1, 2005 after being appointed by MSU's governing board, the <a>Board of Trustees</a>. The Board receives its mandate from the Michigan Constitution since MSU is a state-owned school. The constitution allows for eight <a>trustee</a>s who are elected by statewide referendum every two years. Trustees have eight-year terms, with two of the eight elected every other year. As of 2007, the Board is made up of three <a>Republicans</a> and five <a>Democrats</a>.</p>
<h3>19th century</h3>

Holmes</a>, who kept the Agriculture School from being a part of the <a>University of Michigan</a> and is widely credited with being the prime mover for the school's founding; Also of importance was botany professor <a>William J. Beal</a>, an early plant (hybrid corn) geneticist who championed the laboratory teaching method. Another distinguished faculty member of the era was the alumnus/professor <a>Liberty Hyde Bailey</a>. Bailey was the first to raise the study of horticulture to a science, paralleling botany, which earned him the title of &quot;Father of American Horticulture&quot;. <a>William L. Carpenter</a>, a jurist who was elected to the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan in 1894, and member of the <a>Michigan Supreme Court</a> from 1902 until 1904.
