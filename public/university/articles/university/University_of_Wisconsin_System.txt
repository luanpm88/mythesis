<p> </pre>
<p>The <strong>University of Wisconsin System</strong> is a <a>university system</a> of public <a>universities</a> in the state of <a>Wisconsin</a>. It is one of the largest public higher education systems in the country, enrolling more than 173,000 students each year and employing more than 28,500 faculty and staff statewide. The University of Wisconsin System comprises two <a>doctoral</a> research universities, eleven comprehensive universities, thirteen freshman-sophomore colleges, and the statewide <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Extension</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Wisconsin System was created on October 11, 1971, by Chapter 100, Laws of 1971, which combined the former Chapter 36 (<a>former University of Wisconsin</a>) and Chapter 37 (<a>former Wisconsin State Universities</a>) to create a new Chapter 36 (University of Wisconsin System) of the Wisconsin Statutes.</p>
<h3>Former University of Wisconsin</h3>
<p>The University of Wisconsin was created by the state constitution in 1848, and held its first classes in Madison in 1849. A century later, pressed by the growing demand for a large public university that offered graduate programs in Wisconsin's largest city, Wisconsin lawmakers created another University of Wisconsin campus in <a>Milwaukee</a>. In 1956, the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee</a> was created from a merger of the <a>Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee</a> (WSCM) and the University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee extension. The new campus consisted of both the WSCM campus near the <a>lakefront</a> and the UW extension in downtown Milwaukee.</p>
<p>In 1968, another two University of Wisconsin campuses were created in <a>Green Bay</a> and <a>Kenosha</a>, and  by 1971, the University of Wisconsin system consisted of campuses at <a>Madison</a>, <a>Milwaukee</a>, <a>Green Bay</a> and <a>Parkside</a>, along with 10 freshman-sophomore centers and the statewide UW-Extension.</p>
<h3>UW&#x2013;Milwaukee</h3>
<p> University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee is the second research institution of the University of Wisconsin System and the largest urban university in the state of Wisconsin.  It currently enrolls the most students that are native to the state of Wisconsin and has a total enrollment of 30,000.</p>

<h2>UW Colleges &amp; UW&#x2013;Extension</h2>
<p><a>UW Colleges</a> is an institution of the University of Wisconsin System that grants associate degrees at 13 two-year campuses located throughout the state. Many of the credits earned at the UW Colleges can be transferred to other colleges and universities. The UW Colleges also grant associate degrees through an online program. The <a>UW&#x2013;Extension</a> operates extension courses statewide through offices in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<h3>Naming</h3>
<p>Since the 1971 union of the universities and colleges under the University of Wisconsin System name, there has been a controversy over the arrangement. The name &quot;University of Wisconsin&quot; is often used to refer to the Madison campus, which has made it difficult for other institutions to make names for themselves. Conversely, many who are connected to UW&#x2013;Madison have claimed that having so many institutions share the &quot;University of Wisconsin&quot; title has caused a form of <a>brand dilution</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 and 2009 the students at the Milwaukee campus voted on whether the school should change its name to something that didn't carry the UW name (such as Wisconsin State University or University of Milwaukee). In both cases, a <a>plurality</a> of students voted to retain the name &quot;University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee,&quot; but over 50% were in favor of a different name.  However, since 2004 the UWM athletic program has dropped the UW prefix and simply call themselves the <a>Milwaukee Panthers</a>.  UW-Green Bay has since done the same and are officially the <a>Green Bay Phoenix</a>.  Other UW system programs are commonly referred to by just the city name as they all play in the same conference, the <a>WIAC</a>, making the 'UW' redundant. The exception is UW-Parkside, who plays in the Division II <a>Great Lakes Valley Conference</a> and are commonly just called Parkside.</p>
<h3>Favoritism</h3>
<p>The UW system is often accused of showing favoritism toward UW&#x2013;Madison, at the expense of the other institutions.</p>
