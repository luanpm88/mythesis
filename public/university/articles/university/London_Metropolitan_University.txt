The University has campuses in the <a>City of London</a> and in the <a>London Borough of Islington</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>London Metropolitan University was formed on 1 August 2002 by the merger of <a>London Guildhall University</a> with the <a>University of North London</a>. The change of name of the merged University was approved by the <a>Privy Council</a>. In October 2006, the University opened a new Science Centre, part of a &#x00a3;30m investment in its science department at the North campus close to <a>Holloway Road</a> in <a>North London</a>, the facility includes a &quot;Super Lab&quot; claimed to be one of Europe's most advanced science teaching facilities with 280 workstations equipped with digital audio visual interactive equipment. The President Emeritus, who holds the academic title of Professor, is <a>Sir Roderick Floud</a>.</p>
<h3>London Guildhall University</h3>
<p> In 1848 <a>Charles Blomfield</a>, the <a>Bishop of London</a>, called upon the <a>clergy</a> to establish evening classes to improve the moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in London. In response, the bishop <a>Charles Mackenzie</a>, who instituted the Metropolitan Evening Classes for Young Men in Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate, London, with student fees at one shilling per session. Subjects on the original curriculum included Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, History, Mathematics, Drawing and Natural Philosophy. This fledgling college came under royal patronage following the visit of Prince Albert to the classes in 1851. In 1860 the classes moved to Sussex Hall, the former Livery Hall of the Bricklayers' Company, in Leadenhall Street. By this time, some 800 students were enrolled annually.</p>
<p>In 1861 the classes were reconstituted and named the City of London College. Over the next twenty years, the College was one of the pioneers in the introduction of commercial and technical subjects. The college built new premises in White Street at a cost of &#x00a3;16,000 (contributions were received from <a>Queen Victoria</a> and the <a>Prince of Wales</a>) and were opened in 1881. In 1891 the college joined <a>Birkbeck Institute</a> and the <a>Northampton Institute</a> to form the City Polytechnic by a Charity Commissioners' scheme to facilitate funding for these institutions by the City Parochial Foundation, and to enable the three institutions to work cooperatively. However this attempted federation did not function in practice, as each institution continued to operate more or less independently. The City Polytechnic concept was dissolved in 1906 and the City of London College came under the supervision of <a>London County Council</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1940 the college's building was destroyed by a German air raid. City of London College subsequently moved into premises at 84 <a>Moorgate</a> in 1944. In 1948, the City of London College celebrated its centenary with a service of thanksgiving addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at <a>St Paul's Cathedral</a>. In 1970 the college merged with Sir John Cass College to form the City of London Polytechnic. From 1992 to July 2002, the institution was known as London Guildhall University.</p>
<h3>University of North London</h3>
<p> Founded as the Northern Polytechnic Institute in 1896, it merged in 1971 with the North Western Polytechnic which was established in 1929, to become the Polytechnic of North London. Until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, the Polytechnic was under the control of the Inner London Education Authority &#x2014; part of the then Greater London Council and awarded the degrees of the former Council for National Academic Awards. Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the institution, a pioneer of widening participation and access to higher education, was granted University status and the right to award its own degrees. Following the merger with <a>London Guildhall University</a>, London Metropolitan University became the largest unitary university in <a>Greater London</a>.</p>

<h3>Controversy</h3>
<p>In May 2008, London Metropolitan University presented the <a>14th Dalai Lama</a> with an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy, for &quot;promoting peace globally&quot;. This move caused controversy among the Chinese public and the <a>overseas Chinese</a> community, who view the Dalai Lama as partly responsible for the <a>2008 unrest in Tibet</a>. As a result, Chinese migration agents had been reported to &quot;boycott&quot; London Metropolitan University in advising clients who wish to study in the UK. The university's Vice Chancellor, Brian Roper issued an apology letter to the <a>Chinese Foreign Ministry</a> via embassy officials in July. In an interview with the <a>Global Times</a>, a worker at a Chinese <a>study abroad</a> agency suggested that the University could repair the offence of the honors by refusing speaking platforms to Tibetan independence groups, such as the University's own &quot;Free Tibet Society&quot;.</p>
<h3>Financial crisis</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|A demonstration against job cuts in Jan 2009</a> In July 2008 it was reported that a financial crisis was looming for the university. London Met had been misreporting data on student <a>drop-outs</a> for several years and, consequently, the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE) was proposing to claw back at least &#x00a3;15 million for the overpayment in 2008-9.</p>
<p>News of the crisis led to a demonstration of staff and students outside the universities Tower Building in January 2009. They were calling for the <a>vice-chancellor</a> to be sacked and standing against possible job cuts.</p>
<p>In February 2009 the figure of overpayment was revised to &#x00a3;56 million by <a>HEFCE</a>,  who were seeking to recover the money. Local newspaper the <a>Islington Gazette</a> reported on the high stress levels among staff, including those on long-term sick leave. Alan Pike, a <a>UNISON</a> official, was quoted as saying &quot;In the past two months, we have had about 20 support staff come to us with stress.&quot; </p>
<p>On 19 March 2009, in response to the crisis, vice-chancellor <a>Brian Roper</a> resigned his position with immediate effect but continued to receive his salary until December 2009. Controversially, he received a series of bonuses during the period when the university was returning inaccurate data to HEFCE.</p>
<p>On 29 April 2009, the <a>University and College Union</a> (UCU) announced that members at London Metropolitan University  voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action and 'action short of a strike' against the loss of at least 550 jobs.</p>
<p>In May 2009 <a>Alfred Morris</a>, former vice-chancellor of the <a>University of the West of England</a> and <a>University of Wales, Lampeter</a>, was appointed interim vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>The government announced in May 2009 that there would be an independent inquiry, exploring the possibility that HEFCE had colluded with London Met by failing to query implausibly low drop-out rates.  It concluded in November 2009 and was reported to cast responsibility to Brian Roper, other senior administrators, and the Board of Governors. Following conclusion of the report, the chair of <a>HEFCE</a> called on &quot;senior staff&quot; and the entire Board of Governors to resign, noting that HEFCE was not convinced that the university's management could effectively safeguard public funds.  After the deadline indicated by HEFCE chief executive Alan Langlands had passed, there were ruminations among staff and ministers that HEFCE could withdraw funding, effectively forcing the university to close.</p>
<p>A report commissioned by the university, published in November 2009, found that Roper had &#x201c;the major responsibility and culpability&#x201d; for the financial situation: Roper and some members of the executive were aware that the university had been applying its own interpretation of funding rules on student dropouts &#x2013; rather than the funding council&#x2019;s &#x2013; since 2003, but took no action. The university&#x2019;s <a>board of governors</a> and <a>audit committee</a> had an <a>oversight</a> role, which made them ultimately &#x201c;accountable for a financial failure of this magnitude&#x201d; and meant that they &#x201c;must take overall responsibility&#x201d;.</p>
