<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:DSC02813.JPG|thumb|left|Dillon Hall, University of Windsor, Architect [[Albert Lothian]] ]]</p>
<p>The University dates back to the founding of <a>Assumption College</a> <a>Roman Catholic</a> in <a>Windsor, Ontario</a> in 1857. Escalating costs forced Assumption University (a denominational university) to become a public institution in order to qualify for public support. In 1919 Assumption College in Windsor affiliated with the <a>University of Western Ontario</a>. Originally, Assumption was one the largest colleges associated with the <a>University of Western Ontario</a>. </p>
<p>The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building on the campus of the University of Windsor used as classrooms, labs, and offices. Memorial Hall honours alumni who had enlisted and died in the <a>First World War</a>, and in the <a>Second World War</a>. A bronze tablet remembers the alumni of Assumption College who died in the Second World War. </p>
<p>In 1950, Assumption College welcomed its first women students. In 1953, it ended its affiliation with the University of Western Ontario. It was incorporated as the independent non-denominational University of Windsor through an Act of the <a>Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> on December 19, 1962. Soon after, affiliation agreements were made with Holy Redeemer College, Canterbury College and the new Iona College (affiliated with the <a>United Church of Canada</a>). <a>Canterbury College</a> became the first <a>Anglican</a> college in the world to affiliate with a <a>Roman Catholic</a> University. In 1963, University of Windsor affiliated with Essex College.  Essex College's Arms and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on March 15, 2007.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1963, the University of Windsor assumed control of the campus. <a>Alan Beddoe</a> designed the University's coats of arms.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Lambton Tower on campus.</a> In 1964 Dr. <a>John Francis Leddy</a> became President of the University of Windsor, and presided over a period of significant growth. From 1967 to 1977, Windsor grew from approximately 1,500 to 8,000 full-time students. In the 1980s and early 1990s, this growth continued. Among the new buildings erected were the Odette Business Building and the CAW Student Centre.</p>
<p>Enrollment at the University reached record heights in Fall 2003 with the elimination of Grade 13 (<a>Ontario Academic Credit</a>) in Ontario. The university has developed a number of partnerships with local businesses and industry, such as the University of Windsor/<a>Chrysler</a> Canada Ltd. Automotive Research and Development Centre, the only one of its kind in North America.</p>
<p>University of Windsor's Arms were registered with the <a>Canadian Heraldic Authority</a> on March 15, 2007. &lt;br /&gt;</p>

This clinic operates primarily in the areas of criminal law, landlord tenant law, and small claims court. The clinic offers free legal services to those who qualify financially and all students of the University of Windsor.</p>

<p>As of 2008, the University of Windsor is also home to a satellite campus of the Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry of the University of Western Ontario.  There are currently 54 medical students studying full-time at the Windsor campus.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|View of the Detroit skyline from the park bordering campus.</a> Located in Canada's traditional &quot;automotive capital&quot; across the border from <a>Detroit</a>, the campus is situated near the United States and its busy port of entry to and from the United States. It is framed by the <a>Ambassador Bridge</a> to the west and the <a>Detroit River</a> to the north.</p>
<p>The campus covers 51 contiguous hectares (125 acres) and is surrounded by a residential neighborhood. The campus features a small arboretum which represents most of the species from the <a>Carolinian forest</a>.  Campus is approximately a 10 minute drive from downtown Windsor. The CAW Student Centre has a view of the Ambassador Bridge and houses retail stores, a food court and &quot;The Basement&quot;, the student-operated pub.</p>
<p>The St. Denis Centre, located at the south end of campus on College Avenue, is the major athletic and recreational facility for students; a weight room, exercise facilities and a swimming pool. The new South Campus Stadium built for the 2005 <a>Pan-American Junior Games</a> is beside the St. Denis Centre - which also has dressing rooms for Lancer teams - and borders Huron Church Road, the major avenue to and from the border crossing.  The athletics department has become well known for Track &amp; Field, and Men and Women's Basketball.  The majority of the Lancer teams made the playoffs this year (2010) and the program continues to grow in championship titles.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Detroit windsor 012.jpg|right|thumb|200px|On campus with views of Leddy Library and the [[Ambassador Bridge]] in the background]] <a>thumb|right|University club activity day on Campus</a> International students make up approximately 10% of the student population; about 1500 students from more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>Despite the large amount of international students, the majority of students are domestic and come from the southwestern Ontario counties of Essex, <a>Chatham-Kent</a> and <a>Lambton</a>.</p>
<p>Many students take advantage of their proximity to <a>Michigan</a> for cultural, recreational and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>All full-time undergraduate students are members of the <a>University of Windsor Students' Alliance</a> and possess a health and dental plan coverage as well as access to &quot;<a>The Basement</a>&quot;, a <a>newspaper</a> and a <a>radio station</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the newspaper <a>The Lance</a>&#x2014;which is partially funded by the UWSA and provides stories written by student volunteers&#x2014;the University of Windsor is host to several independent publications. <a>The Student Movement</a> is an alternative student-run website and newspaper offering a critical stance.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Student Residences on campus.</a> <a>Leddy Library</a> is the main campus library. The <a>Paul Martin Law Library</a> serves the Faculty of Law. The <a>Canadian Auto Workers Union</a> helped to build the <a>CAW Student Centre</a> which is a central meeting place for students. The University has a unique agreement with the <a>Ambassador</a> Duty-Free Store, at Canada's busiest border crossing, which provides student jobs, 400 parking spaces, and an annual cash annuity to the school.</p>
<h2>Residence Life</h2>
<p>The University houses male and female students in six different residence halls across campus.</p>
<p>Macdonald, Laurier and Cartier Halls are home to first-year undergraduate students; Laurier Hall hosts alternating single-gender floors while Cartier and Macdonald Halls are entirely co-ed.</p>
<p>Electa Hall is a co-ed building which houses upper year undergrads, graduate students and students in professional programs such as education and law.  Electa Hall hosts both the Law and Education residence communities.</p>
<p>Clark Residence, another upper year residence, is a collection of townhouse style apartments which include fully furnished kitchen facilities in each unit. Clark is available only to upper year students.</p>
<p>Alumni Hall is the only building on campus that houses upper year and first year students together. It is a suite-style residence where rooms have two bedrooms that share a kitchen, and 3-piece bathroom. Because of demand, entrance to Alumni Hall is based on grade-point average for first year undergraduate students.</p>
