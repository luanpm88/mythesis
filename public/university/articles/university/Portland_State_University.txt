<p>  <strong>Portland State University</strong> (<strong>PSU</strong>) is a public state <a>urban university</a> located in downtown <a>Portland, Oregon</a>, <a>United States</a>. Founded in 1946, it has the largest overall enrollment of any university in the state of <a>Oregon</a>, including undergraduate and graduate students. It is also the only public university in the state that is located in a major metropolitan city. Portland State is part of the <a>Oregon University System</a>. The current President is <a>Wim Wiewel</a>, who began his term in August 2008. Its athletic teams are known as the <a>Portland State Vikings</a> with school colors of forest green and white. Teams compete at the NCAA Division I Level, primarily in the <a>Big Sky Conference</a>. Schools at PSU include the <a>Portland State University School of Business Administration</a>, Graduate School of Education, School of Fine and Performing Arts, School of Social Work, College of Urban and Public Affairs, Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University was established as the <em>Vanport Extension Center</em> in June 1946 to satisfy the demand for higher education in Portland for returning World War II veterans. Classes were held in the vacated-for-summer Vanport Junior High School. This first summer session had 221 students. Over 1410 students registered for the 1946 fall term, which was delayed until October 7 due to a lack of space. Since population in <a>Vanport City, Oregon</a> was decreasing after World War II, the extension center was able to use buildings created for other purposes: two childcare centers, a recreation building with three classrooms, and a shopping center, which required substantial modification to house a library, offices, and six classrooms. <a>Lincoln</a> and <a>Jefferson</a> high schools were used after school hours, as well as the <a>University of Oregon</a>'s dental and medical schools, located in Portland, and at Vanport Junior High School.</p>
<p>Following the <a>Vanport Flood of 1948</a>, the college became known as &quot;the college that wouldn't die&quot; for refusing to close after the flood. The term was coined by Lois Hennessey, a student who wrote about the college and the flood in the <a>Christian Science Monitor</a>, then to  hastily-converted buildings at the Oregon Shipyard, Students and faculty had begun calling the school &quot;Portland State College&quot; by 1952, however. By 1956, the veterans had subsided, and baby food was no longer stocked in the bookstore. a proposal which would remove Portland State from the <a>Oregon University System</a> and merge its governance with OHSU into a <em>Portland Metropolitan Universities Board</em>. A legislative hearing was held on March 19 where representatives from PSU and OHSU opposed the proposal.</p>
<p>In September 2008 the <a>James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation</a> awarded Portland State University a $25 million challenge grant. The grant is the largest amount in the history of the Foundation and at Portland State. Both the $25 million Miller grant and the funds raised to match it must be used exclusively for sustainability programs. Today, Portland State&#x2019;s sustainability research and education is focused on four primary areas of inquiry: creating sustainable urban communities, the integration of human societies and the natural environment, implementing sustainability and mechanisms of change and measuring sustainability. Since 1998, the Miller Foundation has also contributed more than $5.3 million to Portland State.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:PSU campus in spring 07.JPG&#x200e;|thumb|left|The South Park Blocks of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] run through PSU's central campus.]] Portland State differs from the other universities in Oregon partially because as an urban institution it attracts a student body older than other rural universities. In the 2006-2007 school year, it was reported that the average age of an attending student was 25 years. A significant percentage of Portland State's classes are offered at night and Saturdays. Indeed, some programs only offer classes at night. PSU also delayed the development of its campus for decades after its founding. The institution sold land in a neighboring block soon after its move to downtown Portland, and delayed the construction of student housing until the early 1970s.</p>
<p>While the mean age of students is near the mid twenties, increasing traditional enrollment is lowering the average student age.  Ambitious mixed-use building projects (commercial, educational, residential) by the university are purposed to attract younger students. These projects preserve downtown shops and businesses while transforming the university from a &quot;commuter campus&quot; to a mix between a commuter and a traditional campus. Recently completed residences include the <a>Stephen Epler Hall</a> and <a>The Broadway</a>. Further steps toward increasing housing capacity &mdash; and university control over its own housing &mdash; are being taken with plans for further construction, and with PSU taking over management of the residence halls it currently owns. Optional residential and social opportunities exist with a small but active Greek system, which includes <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a>, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, <a>Phi Sigma Sigma</a>, <a>Tau Kappa Epsilon</a> and <a>Phi Gamma Nu</a>.[<a>http://web.pdx.edu/~salp/groups_display.php?group_type=3&amp;order_by=1&amp;order_type=1</a>]</p>
<p>In March 2007, Portland State University took over the managing of the on-campus housing at Portland State University. College Housing Northwest, which has previously managed the on-campus housing buildings (including The Broadway, Stephen Epler Hall, West Hall, King Albert, St. Helens, Montgomery Court, and Ondine) for over 30 years, will still maintain its off-campus housing (including Goose Hollow, The Palidian, The Cambrian, and Clay).</p>
<p>The <a>student government</a> is the Associated Students of Portland State University (ASPSU).  In addition to a student body President and Vice President, there is a Student Fee Committee, a 25-member Student Senate chaired by the Vice President, and a Judicial Board which rules on ASPSU constitutional questions. There are also a number of university committees that have student members appointed by the ASPSU President.[<a>http://aspsu.pdx.edu</a>] Portland State also participates in the <a>Oregon Student Association</a>, the statewide student lobbying non-profit.</p>
<p>The <a>student newspaper</a> at Portland State is the <em><a>Daily Vanguard</a></em>, a fully student-run newspaper established in 1946. The student run radio station is <a>KPSU</a>. <a>&quot;The Portland Review&quot;</a> is a literary magazine of poetry, fiction and art published by <a>PSU's Student Publications Board</a>. Additional <a>student newspaper</a>s at PSU are <a>The Rearguard</a>, an alternative-monthly newspaper, and <a>The Spectator</a>.</p>
<p>The 1.3 million volume <a>Branford Price Millar Library</a> is located in the center of campus, and offers an open microcomputer lab. The Branford Price Millar Library is a repository for federal documents.</p>
<p>Portland State University is served by the <a>MAX Green Line</a>, the <a>MAX Yellow Line</a>, the <a>Portland Streetcar</a>, <a>Trimet</a> buses, and by <a>Oregon Health &amp; Science University</a> and <a>Portland Community College</a> Shuttles on SW Harrison Street at SW Broadway.</p>
<p>Among a number of student managed <a>club sports</a> on campus are the <a>PSU Rugby Club</a>, the <a>PSU Ice Hockey Club</a> and the <a>PSU Lacrosse Club</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Portland State Vikings</a>  Portland State is a member of the <a>Big Sky Conference</a> (joining in 1996), <a>Pac-10 Conference</a> in wrestling and the <a>Pacific Coast Softball Conference</a>. PSU competes at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> level in basketball, women's volleyball, golf and soccer, wrestling, tennis, softball, indoor and outdoor track and field and cross country. Football competes at the <a>Division I AA</a> (or Football Championship Subdivision) level.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Division I, the school won NCAA National Division II Championships in women's volleyball and wrestling. The school has also placed second twice nationally in football and once in women's basketball at the Division II level.</p>
<p>Portland State's colors are <a>forest green</a> and <a>white</a>, and its mascot is the Viking personified as &quot;Victor E. Viking&quot;. Purple was originally a school color but was dropped in favor of green and white.</p>
<p>Among the two more notable former Portland State athletes are <a>Freeman Williams</a> and <a>Neil Lomax</a>. Freeman Williams was the NCAA Division I national men's basketball individual scoring leader in 1977 and 1978. Neil Lomax was a record setting quarterback who went on to star for the then St. Louis Cardinals in the <a>NFL</a>.   Football's &quot;<a>Run &amp; Shoot</a>&quot; offense was first implemented at the college level at PSU by then coach <a>Darryl &quot;Mouse&quot; Davis</a>. Davis' quarterback prot&#x00e9;g&#x00e9;s were Lomax and <a>June Jones</a>.</p>
<p>Home games for football are held off-campus at <a>PGE Park</a>, and home games for basketball are held on-campus at the <a>Peter Stott Center</a>. In 2008, the men's basketball team earned their first ever bid into the <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a>.</p>
