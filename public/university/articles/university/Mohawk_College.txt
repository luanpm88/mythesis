<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mohawk College was established during the formation of Ontario&#x2019;s college system in 1966. The school was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create <a>many such institutions</a> to provide career-oriented <a>diploma</a> and <a>certificate</a> courses, as well as <a>continuing education</a> programs to <a>Ontario</a> communities. Mohawk was the first college in Canada to offer co-operative education work terms where students gain real-world and hands-on learning. Today, one-third of Mohawk's programs offer co-op work terms.</p>
<p>Mohawk was the first college in Ontario to introduce a mandatory active citizenship course for all full-time students in the Fall of 2005. In 2007, Mohawk became the first college in Ontario and only the second in Canada to become an official chapter of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship (ICC). In partnership with the ICC and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Mohawk hosts two citizenship ceremonies each year to welcome Canada's newest citizens. </p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Fennell Campus</h3>
<p>The Fennell Campus in Hamilton is Mohawk's largest campus and is home to programs from Mohawk's Schools of Business, Human Services, Arts, Science and Communications, and Engineering Technology.  Mohawk is a member of the <a>Ontario College Athletic Association</a>. The gym facility at Fennell Campus includes two intramural basketball and volleyball courts, badminton courts and fitness areas with free weights and cardio equipment.  <a>McIntyre Theatre</a> accommodates up to 1039 people and is only second to Hamilton Place in size in the area. A health clinic is available to staff and students with a full-time college physician and nursing staff. Counseling And Disability Services provides students with various services such as counseling, facilitation, and peer tutorial services.  &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>right|thumb|175|Brantford Campus</a> --&gt;</p>
<h3>Brantford Campus</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 full-time and 150 apprenticeship students attend Mohawk Brantford. The campus is home to Mohawk's Centre of Excellences in Public Safety and Security and the Advanced Design and Packaging Technologies. Mohawk has articulation agreements in place with Laurier and Nipissing Universities in Brantford.</p>
<p>As of late 2009 some speculation has risen regarding a future closure of the Brantford Campus on Elgin street.  The College seeks to move the campus to a more modern facility by 2012.  Mohawk College expressed interest in moving the Campus to downtown Brantford, a venture that would cost the city approximately $13.5 Million.  An application for a Federal grant to relieve some of the project costs was also rejected.  The City of Brantford had a lukewarm response to the whole debacle, leaving Mohawk College to contemplate other possible Brantford Campus locations, or the possibility of leaving the city altogether.  An application for a Federal grant to fund the project was also rejected.  Mohawk spokesman Jay Robb summarized the institution's position of the issue; &quot;We were the first post-secondary institution in Brantford and we have a 40-year presence in the city. We made a commitment to try to move into the downtown.  Our staff will now put a report together for the board to consider in the coming months.&quot;</p>
<h3>STARRT Institute</h3>
<p>Formerly known as the Stoney Creek campus, it was renamed to Skilled Trades and Apprenticeship Research, Resources and Training (STARRT) Institute after a $27 million investment by government, industry and private donors. Mohawk claims to be the largest trainer of apprentices in Ontario, with more than 3,500 apprentices at STARRT.[<a>http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/Explore/News/STARRT.html</a>]</p>
<h3>IAHS at McMaster University in Hamilton</h3>
<p>More than 1,700 full-time students attend Mohawk-McMaster Institute for Applied Health Sciences (IAHS), the first facility in Canada to combine college and university health sciences education and research under one roof. The IAHS is home to collaborative nursing and medical radiation sciences programs that have achieved the highest level of accreditation possible. In 2008 and 2009, teams of undergraduate medical radiation science students have had their class research projects published in an international medical journal. The IAHS includes a clinical simulation lab modelled after a hospital ward and a fully operational medical radiation lab where students gain hands-on experience prior to clinical placements.[<a>http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/calendar/HealthSciences/IAHS.html</a>]</p>
<h2>Official School Song</h2>

<p>Lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the halls of Mohawk College &lt;br&gt;Steadfastly our sights we raise &lt;br&gt;Testing truths, exploring knowledge &lt;br&gt;Heartened by each conquered phase &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gathered we with purpose certain &lt;br&gt;Strengthened by these words we sing&lt;br&gt; From the crest of Mohawk&#x2019;s mountain&lt;br&gt; Let our college anthem ring&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When from here our pathways lead us&lt;br&gt; In our hearts where&#x2019;er we roam&lt;br&gt; Linger thoughts of friendships precious&lt;br&gt; And of this our other home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Gathered we with purpose certain&lt;br&gt; Strengthened by these words we sing&lt;br&gt; From the crest of Mohawk&#x2019;s mountain&lt;br&gt; Let our college anthem ring </p>
