<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bolton Institute of Higher Education was formed in 1982 by the merger of the <strong>Bolton Institute of Technology</strong> and <strong>Bolton College of Education (Technical)</strong>.</p>
<p>Bolton Institute was awarded the right to award taught degrees in 1990, with the powers to award research degrees in 1994.</p>
<p>In April 2004, the Institute was awarded university status with immediate effect. The institution then set about searching for a new name to match its university status. A long consultation period considered many titles, including 'Bolton University', 'Bolton Institute University', 'West Pennines University', 'Bolton Metropolitan University' and 'Bolton Leverhulme University', before announcing 'University of Bolton' as the new title on 2 September 2004. The title was approved by the <a>Privy Council</a> on 27 January 2005 and officially adopted.</p>
<h2>Academic quality</h2>
<p>The UK national Quality Audit of University of Bolton 2005 reports that &quot;broad confidence can be placed in the soundness of the current management of the quality of its programmes and in the University's institutional-level capacity to manage effectively the security of its awards.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2006 the university was awarded the highest level of recommendation by the government's quality control agency for universities, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).
