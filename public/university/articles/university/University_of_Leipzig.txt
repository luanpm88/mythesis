<p> The <strong>University of Leipzig</strong> (), located in <a>Leipzig</a> in the <a>Free State of Saxony</a>, <a>Germany</a>, is one of the oldest <a>universities</a> in <a>Europe</a> and the <a>second-oldest</a> university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. It has a long tradition of globally oriented and culturally comparative historical research and tertiary-level teaching.</p>
<p>The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by <a>Frederick I, Elector of Saxony</a> and his brother <a>William II, Margrave of Meissen</a>, and originally comprised four faculties. Since its inception the university has enjoyed over 600 years of uninterrupted teaching and research.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding and development until 1900</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Former main building in front of MDR skyscraper.</a> The university was modelled on the <a>University of Prague</a>, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the <a>Jan Hus</a> crisis and the <a>Decree of Kutn&#x00e1; Hora</a>. The <em>Alma mater Lipsiensis</em> opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by <a>Pope Alexander V</a> in his <em><a>Bull of Acknowledgment</a></em> on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was <a>Johann von M&#x00fc;nsterberg</a>. During the first centuries of its existence the university grew slowly and was more a regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world class institution of higher education and research. Until the beginning of the Second World War Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later <a>Nobel Prize laureate</a>s and many of the university's alumni became important scientists themselves.</p>
<h3>The University During the GDR</h3>
<p>By the end of World War II, 60% of the university's buildings and 70% of its books had been destroyed. The university reopened on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the GDR. In 1948, the freely elected student council members were disbanded and replaced by <a>FDJ</a> members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned. But the university was also nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, <a>Herbert Belter</a>, paid for his commitment to democracy with his life and was executed in 1951 in Moscow. In 1953 the University was renamed by the new rulers in &quot;<a>Karl-Marx</a>-University Leipzig&quot;. In 1968, the partly damaged <a>Augusteum</a> including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact <a>St. Paul's Church</a> were blasted to make way for redevelopment of the university. This was carried out between 1973 to 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now <a>City-Hochhaus Leipzig</a>) in the form of an open book.</p>
<h3>After the Reunification</h3>
<p>In 1991, the University was renamed again to its original name University of Leipzig (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the <a>GDR</a> barely secured, was completed in 2002. In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide &quot;Initiative of Excellence&quot; of Germany and it was granted the graduate school &quot;<a>BuildMoNa</a>: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences - Building with Molecules and Nano-objects&quot;. In addition the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the &quot;Life&quot; project - a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the <a>&quot;Bach Archive&quot;</a> was associated with the university. With the delivery of the <a>University Tower</a> to a private user, the university was forced spread some faculties over several locations in the city. Furthermore it redesigned its historical centre at the <a>Augustusplatz</a>. This action was highly controversial. In 2002 Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition. A first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of <a>St. Paul's Church</a> and <a>Augusteum</a>. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. These disputes led to a scandal in early 2003, were the Rector Volker Bigl, and the pro-rectors resigned in protest against the government. This was further forced after severe tensions had built up because of the Saxon university treaty on the future funding of higher education. As a compromise they could agree on the implementation of a second competition, which only covered the <a>Augustusplatz</a> front of the university. On 24 March 2004, a jury chose the design by Dutch architect <a>Erick van Egeraat</a>, which was well received by almost all sides. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. The renovations began in the summer of 2005. In 2009 the University of Leipzig celebrates its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from the beginning until today in Germany and Europe.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p><a>University library Bibliotheca Albertina.|thumb</a> The University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the University of Leipzig as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building &quot;Bibliotheca Albertina&quot; and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction since 2005; the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect <a>Erick van Egeraat</a>. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euro. The new buildings are going to be completed in 2009/2010, just in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, there are several other bodies that serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the <a>Museum for Music Instruments</a> and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's <a>Leipzig Botanical Garden</a> was established in 1542 and it is the second oldest botanical garden in Europe.  The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving <a>piano</a>s built by <a>Bartolomeo Cristofori</a>, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.</p>

It is also the home of <a><em>aspeers:emerging voices in american studies</em></a>, a graduate-level peer-reviewed scholarly journal for <a>American studies</a>. Erasmus Mundus Global Studies on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of four European universities: University of Leipzig, the <a>London School of Economics</a>, <a>University of Vienna</a>, and <a>University of Wroclaw</a>. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few <a>Confucius Institute</a>s.
