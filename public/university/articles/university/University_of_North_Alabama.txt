<p> [[Image:Harrison-plaza2.jpg|right|thumb|220px| Harrison Plaza at the University of North Alabama in Florence. The school was chartered as LaGrange College by the [[Alabama Legislature]] in 1830.]] The <strong>University of North Alabama</strong> (abbreviated UNA) is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>university</a> located in <a>Florence</a>, <a>Alabama</a>, and the state's oldest four-year public university.</p>
<p>Occupying a  campus in a residential section of Florence, UNA is located within a four-city area that also includes <a>Tuscumbia</a>, <a>Sheffield</a> and <a>Muscle Shoals</a>.  The four cities comprise a metropolitan area with a combined population of 140,000 people.</p>
<p>The University of North Alabama, which celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2005, has undergone numerous sweeping changes in the course of its long history.  Originally founded as LaGrange College in 1830, it was reestablished in 1872 as the first state-supported <a>teachers college</a> south of the <a>Ohio River</a>. A year later, it became one of the nation's first coeducational colleges.</p>
<p>Within the last half century, the University of North Alabama has developed into a comprehensive regional university exerting a major influence over the cultural, social and economic life of Northwest Alabama and providing educational opportunities for students pursuing undergraduate and graduate majors offered through the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Nursing and Health. </p>
<p>UNA administrators also have expressed a strong commitment to improving academic quality, an effort perhaps reflected in the 2008 edition of <a>U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s America&#x2019;s Best Colleges</a>, which ranked the university as a top tier public university. </p>
<p>UNA also underwent continued growth in 2009, with 7,243 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled for the fall semester.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>left|thumb|275px|Harrison Plaza, official entrance to the University of North Alabama. In the background is Bibb Graves Hall, the University's main administrative building.</a>The University of North Alabama and the surrounding residential area share a rich history.  The UNA campus is adjacent to the Seminary-O&#x2019;Neal Historic District, named for the street on which the Synodical Female College was located and for two Alabama governors.  The district, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, also is noted for its residential structures, built between 1908 and 1943 and representing a wide array of architectural styles.</p>
<p>UNA's initial campus facilities master plan was developed by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, the same architectural firm that designed New York City's <a>Central Park</a>. A copy of the original Olmsted plan is permanently displayed in the President&#x2019;s Office in Bibb Graves Hall.</p>
<p>The modern campus is distinguished by its shaded walkways, spacious green lawns, fountains, sculptures and historic buildings. UNA also is noted for its three antebellum structures: <a>Wesleyan Hall</a>; <a>Rogers Hall</a>; and <a>Coby Hall</a>.</p>
<p>Gifts from friends and alumni and federal grants made possible a massive renovation of the UNA campus to conform with the landscape design originally formulated by Olmstead brothers. The university was transformed into an almost entirely pedestrian campus, with a brick walkway added to simulate the nearby <a>Tennessee River</a> and accented with fountains designed by Hugo Dante, of the Hill and Jangaard architectural firm, of Florence.</p>
<h3>Laura Harrison Plaza</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|220px|Laura Harrison Plaza at dusk.</a>The undertaking culminated in October, 2002, with the dedication of the Harrison Plaza, made possible  by Laura McAnally Harrison, a 1955 graduate of Florence State Teachers College (now the University of North Alabama) and her husband, Dr. Donald C. Harrison, of Cincinnati.  The Plaza, constructed around a large Italian limestone fountain, occupies the former intersections of Morrison and Wesleyan Avenues and Seminary Street between Bibb Graves Hall, Keller Hall and the <a>George H. Carroll Lion Habitat</a>, which houses UNA&#x2019;s live mascots.  Harrison Plaza now constitutes the hub of UNA&#x2019;s three pedestrian walkways and serves as the official entrance to campus. General <a>William Tecumseh Sherman</a> is considered the most famous Civil War-era occupant of Wesleyan Hall.</p>
<h3>Coby Hall</h3>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|pix200|right|Coby Hall is a popular site for teas, receptions and other campus-related social events.</a>Coby Hall, one of the most recent additions to UNA&#x2019;s campus, was donated to the university in 1990 by David Brubaker in memory of his wife, Coby Stockard Brubaker.  Built by John Simpson on the site of his earlier home in 1843, the Simpson House/Irvine Place, as it previously was known, later was purchased by George W. Foster, builder of Courtview, for his daughter, Virginia, and her husband, James B. Irvine.</p>
<p>Coby Hall also is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<h3>The Guillot University Center</h3>
<p>The Robert M. Guillot University Center, the hub of student life, is named after one of UNA&#x2019;s most popular presidents, who served from 1972 to 1989.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Named after one of UNA's most beloved presidents, the sprawling Guillot University Center constitutes the hub of UNA student life.</a>Popularly known as the &#x201c;GUC,&#x201d; it houses the On-Campus Bookstore, the Post Office, Jazzman's coffee shop, and the Academic Resource Center computer lab.   The GUC also houses Student Activities, Intramural and Recreational Sports, Student Development, and the Student Government Association. The Performance Center, located on the second floor, hosts a variety of events including concerts and comedy acts.</p>
<h3>Willingham Hall</h3>
<p>[[Image:Willingham-hall-una.JPG|thumb|pix250|left|Willingham Hall is one of several buildings on campus built by the [[Works Projects Administration]] in the 1930s.]]Originally a women&#x2019;s dormitory, Willingham Hall, named after long-serving President Henry J. Willingham, was constructed by the <a>Works Projects Administration</a> in 1939.  Willingham Hall currently houses the Department of English and the Department of History and Political Science. It stands on the site of the old Locust Dell Academy, founded by Nichols Marcellus Hentz and commemorated by a historical marker.</p>
<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama will soon encompass two campuses, following a decision in June, 2006, by the university&#x2019;s Board of Trustees to purchase J.W. Powell School from the Florence City Schools.  The East Campus will house several academic units, including the Office of Continuing Studies and Outreach and the Human Environmental Sciences' state of the art Culinary Facility. The Culinary Arts program is the first and only four-year Culinary Program in a public institution of higher learning in Alabama.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The University of North Alabama first opened its doors as LaGrange College on January 11, 1830, in a mountain hamlet a few miles south of <a>Leighton</a> in northeast <a>Franklin County, Alabama</a>. LaGrange means &quot;The Place&quot; in French.  Twenty-one local college trustees were listed in Acts of Alabama, Eleventh Annual Session. <a>thumb|pix224|right|The monument marking the site of LaGrange College.</a>Today only a nine-ton stone monument silently guards the ghosts of the once bustling little town of LaGrange and its vibrant college, both of which were sacked and burned by <a>Union</a> troops in 1863. But by then, however, the college, as such, had moved north across the <a>Tennessee River</a> to Florence. The section of Franklin County containing <a>LaGrange Mountain</a> is now <a>Colbert County</a>. LaGrange College, which became Florence Wesleyan University in 1855, is now the University of North Alabama.</p>
<p>LaGrange College arose from the idea offered at a November 28, 1826 meeting of the <a>Tennessee Conference</a> of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a> to establish a college which would not be &#x201c;religious or theological.&quot; By January 1829, the selection of Lawrence Hill on LaGrange Mountain was made for the site of the school.</p>
<p>A year later, LaGrange College opened to students of all denominations in two three-story brick buildings. (This was slightly more than a year before the <a>University of Alabama</a> would open in <a>Tuscaloosa</a>.) Eight days after the opening of LaGrange College, the <a>Alabama Legislature</a> issued a charter for the institution, making it the first state-chartered institution to begin operation in Alabama.  Other colleges were in operation, but not chartered by the state.</p>
<p><a>thumb|pix229|left|The Kilby Laboratory School was constructed in 1922 and named in honor of then-Alabama Governor Thomas K. Kilby. The building still functions as a lecture hall. UNA has the only university-owned and operated elementary laboratory school.</a>The Rev. <a>Robert Paine</a> was the first president. The <a>North Carolina</a> native was also the professor of moral science and <a>belles lettres</a> and taught <a>geography</a> and <a>mineralogy</a>. He was assisted by two other professors. The first board of trustees had a total of 50 members, including two <a>Native Americans</a>, a <a>Choctaw</a> politician and a <a>Cherokee</a> leader. In 1830, <a>Turner Saunders</a>, a native of Virginia, was the first President of the Board of Trustees. Saunders' mansion c1826 still stands in Lawrence County. Among the many distant trustees was John Coffee of Florence, friend of Andrew Jackson.  Among the local trustees was Henry Stuart Foote of Tuscumbia, who would move to Mississippi and defeat Jefferson Davis in the 1850 Governor's race. <a>J.D. Malone</a>, of <a>Limestone County</a>, was the first graduate in 1833.</p>
<p>In 1850, a <a>grammar</a> school was added to LaGrange College. (Today, UNA has the only university-owned and operated elementary laboratory school - <a>Kilby Professional Laboratory School</a> - in Alabama.) In 1858 the death of the school's president and the loss of most of its students to nearby Florence, the college was suspended and re-established as the LaGrange College and Military Academy, with James W. Robertson as superintendent. Under its new name, additional buildings were constructed and the school reached its highest prosperity. the state of Alabama made provision for two cadets from each county to be enrolled, and by 1861 47 of its 171 students were state cadets. The school suffered a loss of enrollment again when Alabama seceded, and in March 1862 Robertson received approval from the Alabama governor to enroll the 35th Alabama Infantry from faculty, cadets, and enlistees from surrounding counties.</p>
<p>On April 28, 1863, the buildings were destroyed by Union soldiers of the <a>10th Missouri Cavalry</a>, including a library of 4,000 volumes.</p>
<p>Among LaGrange's alumni were several generals, Alabama governors <a>Edward A. O'Neal</a> and <a>David P. Lewis</a>, <a>Alabama Supreme Court</a> justice <a>William M. Byrd</a> and <a>U.S. Senator</a> <a>Jeremiah Clemens</a>, who wrote the first <a>American Civil War</a> novel and the first western novel.</p>
<h3>Florence State College</h3>
<p><a>thumb|pix224|left|The university seal, bearing one of the university's previous names, Florence State College, is displayed in the masonry bordering Guillot University Center.</a>Progress continued apace toward the comprehensive university the institution ultimately would become.  In 1956, the institution crossed another academic milestone with the formation of a graduate course of study in education leading to the Master of Arts degree.  With the establishment of a new Graduate Division, the graduate program was launched in the summer of 1957. The same year, the Alabama Legislature voted to change the institution&#x2019;s name to Florence State College to reflect its expanding academic mission. </p>
<p>Gunn, who subsequently earned degrees from Florence State College and the <a>University of Chicago</a>, went on to a distinguished career and was appointed a special assistant to President <a>Ronald Reagan</a> in 1982.</p>
<h3>Florence State University</h3>
<p>Yet another major milestone was crossed in 1967 when the Alabama Legislature removed jurisdiction for the college from the State Board of Education and vested it in a Board of Trustees.  Scarcely a year later, the new board voted for another name change to Florence State University, once again symbolizing the steady expansion of the institution&#x2019;s academic offerings and mission.</p>
<h3>A ghost-ridden campus?</h3>
<p>By some accounts, the University of North Alabama campus is ridden with ghosts.  One of the most popular ghost stories - once related to incoming freshmen with considerable aplomb by upperclassmen - concerned a young woman named Priscilla who, because of some terrible but undisclosed secret, hanged herself in the elevator shaft of O'Neal Hall, which then functioned as a dormitory. The story holds that she has chosen to spend her afterlife haunting the building and the Guillot University Center that eventually replaced it. Meanwhile, in nearby Norton Auditorium, a ghost affectionately known among the UNA community as George - supposedly a worker who fell to his death from scaffolding while the auditorium was under construction - is frequently heard moving back and forth across the catwalk.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama offers more than 60 majors through its four colleges.</p>
<h3>Graduate programs</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama offers graduate programs in <a>business administration</a>; <a>criminal justice</a>; English; community counseling; health promotion and human performance, <a>special education</a>; <a>elementary education</a>; <a>secondary education</a>; and educational administration.</p>
<p>Recently, the <a>Alabama Commission on Higher Education</a> approved UNA's proposal for a master of arts in history.</p>
<p>The advanced degree program, which began accepting students in spring, 2007, offered a full course load this fall.  The university anticipates that the program, which partly was established to meet local demand for such a degree, will attract between 15 and 20 new students each year.  Dr. Evan Ward, director of the program, says that all of the instructors are involved in historical research and that the quality of instruction will rival those of institutions offering similar courses of study.</p>
<h3>Distinctive academic programs</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama was the first major university to offer a four-year degree in <a>commercial music</a>, which has become one of the university's most successful programs - one that has been enhanced by the development of the UNA Entertainment Industry Center and the addition of an <a>entertainment industry</a> major.  UNA commercial music majors have interned in record industry offices in <a>Nashville</a>, <a>New York</a>, <a>Los Angeles</a>, <a>London</a>, <a>Stockholm</a>, and nearby <a>Muscle Shoals</a>, world-renowned for its recording industry.</p>
<p>[[Image:PattersonHood.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Former UNA student Patterson Hood, front man for the nationally acclaimed [[Drive-by Truckers]], performing in <a>Auburn, Alabama</a>, in 2005. Hood's father, <a>David</a>, an internationally renowned bassist, also attended UNA.]]Ironically, UNA's nationally recognized commercial music program cannot lay claim to one of the most successful recording artists ever associated with the university.</p>
<p>Speaking in January, 2006, as a guest lecturer for the <a>University of Georgia's</a> business music certificate program, former University of North Alabama student <a>Patterson Hood</a>, songwriter and front man for the nationally acclaimed <a>Southern rock</a> band <a>Drive-by Truckers</a>, said he would have welcomed the opportunity to have enrolled in a music business program rather than to have built his career through trial and error. The Florence native had tried but failed to get into UNA's nationally acclaimed commercial music program. &quot;They wouldn't let me in!&quot; he said, still visibly affected by the memory. Hood's father, world renowned bassist <a>David Hood</a>, also attended UNA.</p>
<p>UNA is one of only 11 schools nationwide that offer an undergraduate degree in <a>industrial hygiene</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, UNA announced that it would add another course of study to its curriculum - culinary arts - following approval by the <a>Alabama Commission on Higher Education</a> in June.  The university becomes the first four-year public institution in the state to offer such a program.</p>
<p>Other programs the university characterizes as &quot;regionally unique&quot; include the <a>marine biology</a> and <a>hospitality management</a> programs.</p>
<h3>The University Honors Program</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama Honors Program [<a>http://www.una.edu/honors</a>] was founded in 2005 and recently graduated its first entering cohort, the Class of 2009. The Honors Program is a distinguished degree option for exceptional students from all majors and colleges on campus. Open primarily to first year students and transfers on a limited basis, the Honors Program consists of 27 credit hours of coursework, social and cultural enrichment programming, a residential home, a civic engagement component, travel opportunities, scholarships, and a capstone project during the senior year. The Capstone Project consists of a final project in the major field of study through independent research and/or through junior and senior seminars. Honors faculty are selected for the enthusiasm for teaching, knowledge in their discipline, and dedication to student learning. Student applicants are recruited from throughout the southeast and evaluated on a holistic basis using standardized test scores, GPA, community service, leadership, and writing ability. Students accepted into the Program must maintain a 3.25 grade point average and participate in Program events. Graduates are entitled to receive diplomas bearing the distinction of &#x201c;Honors Program&#x201d; and receive special designation on their transcripts.</p>
<h3>Accreditations</h3>
<p>The University of North Alabama is accredited by the <a>Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.  Colleges and departments that have earned accreditation include the colleges of Education, Business, and Nursing and Allied Health, and the departments of Social Work (and Criminal Justice), Music, Art and Chemistry and Industrial Hygiene.  English as a Second Language program is accredited by the <a>English Language Program Association</a>.</p>
<p>The Department of Chemistry also is certified by <a>The American Chemical Society</a>.</p>
<h3>International emphasis</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|225px|The Court of Flags, located in the atrium of Guillot University Center, symbolizes UNA&#x2019;s highly diverse student body.</a>According to the tenth edition of American Universities and Colleges, published in 1968 by the <a>American Council on Education</a>, the University of North Alabama, then known as Florence State College, had only 3 international students enrolled during the 1966-67 academic year &#x2014; 2 undergraduate students and 1 graduate student, all from the Middle East.  However, during the Robert Potts administration, UNA undertook a concerted effort to diversify its student body by recruiting individuals from throughout the world.  By 2004, international enrollment had grown to nearly 300 students representing 35 countries. The Global Friendship Organization has become one of the largest and most influential student organizations on campus.  A major focus of the GFO is organizing campus and community activities to integrate international students more closely with other UNA students and also with the surrounding Shoals community.</p>
<p>Charmy Gupta, an MBA student from <a>Gujarat, India</a>, was selected as the 2007 Homecoming Queen, a notable example of the integral role international students now serve within the UNA community.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Diorama</strong>, UNA&#x2019;s student-run yearbook, has won numerous awards competing at the national level with other yearbooks.</li>
  <li><strong>The Flor-Ala</strong>, named after Florence, Alabama, has functioned as the school newspaper since 1931.  Published in 29 issues each year, the paper is run by UNA students who serve in all facets of news gathering, writing and production. The Flor-Ala is an affiliate of <a>UWIRE</a>, which distributes and promotes its content to their network.</li>
  <li><strong>Lights &amp; Shadows</strong>, published once a year, is the university&#x2019;s award-winning literary and art magazine. Originally started as a publication of the Florence State Teachers College English Club in 1956, the magazine has earned numerous awards, including first place in the Southern Literary Association&#x2019;s annual competition.</li>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> UNA operates a successful collegiate athletic program in <a>NCAA Division II</a>'s <a>Gulf South Conference</a>.  The North Alabama Lions football, men's basketball, and women's volleyball teams have each won national championships.</p>
<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|pix300|left|O'Neal Hall, circa 1978. A former dormitory, the &quot;Brick House,&quot; as O'Neal was commonly known, housed the embryonic Greek community at UNA. The Greek letters are clearly visible under the windows. In time, most of the fraternities secured off-campus lodges. Sororities remained until the building was demolished in the 1980's to make space for Guillot University Center.</a></p>
<p>UNA&#x2019;s Greek system is approaching its 40th anniversary.  The university&#x2019;s embryonic Greek community initially was housed in O&#x2019;Neal Hall, which was demolished in the 1980s to clear space for the construction of the Guillot University Center.</p>
<h3>Fraternities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|pix300|right|The Phi Gamma Delta House, which has functioned longer as a fraternity house than any other house on the UNA campus.</a>Robert Guillot, president from 1972&#x2013;89, accurately could be described as the father of UNA Greek life.  He initially chose 7 national fraternities to colonize UNA, stipulating that all chapter colonies had to be granted charters by November 1, 1974. Failure meant dissolution and replacement by new groups, which, in turn, could petition the same or other selected national fraternities for affiliation.</p>
<p>The threat apparently worked. Successfully chartered fraternity chapters - <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a>, <a>Delta Chi</a>, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> and <a>Sigma Chi</a> - subsequently began acquiring off-campus lodges that over time were upgraded to or replaced by fraternity houses.  Kappa Sigma's Lambda-Omicron chapter was the first chapter to acquire an off-campus lodge, the site of the present-day Off-Campus Bookstore. </p>
<p>Kappa Sigma's Lambda-Omicron chapter was the first fraternity to construct a house on UNA's fraternity row, which opened on April 4, 1984.</p>
<h3>Sororities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|pix300|left|UNA's Panhellenic Residence is located in Appleby East and West Halls.</a>A similar strategy was followed with sorority recruitment.  As with the fraternities, invitations were extended to national sororities with the strongest alumni presence in the Florence area and, consequently, with the best prospects for success -  <a>Alpha Delta Pi</a>, <a>Alpha Gamma Delta</a>, Alpha Omiron Pi (no longer on campus), <a>Phi Mu</a>, and <a>Zeta Tau Alpha</a>.</p>
<p>Young women interested in joining the emerging Greek system were encouraged to sign up for recruitment and subsequently were divided into several groups to visit rooms on campus assigned to sorority recruiters.  In the interest of fairness, only four alumnae could be present in each of these rooms while recruiting occurred.</p>
<p>According to an article on UNA Greek life in the 1982 Diorama, the first historically African-American sorority chartered on campus, <a>Delta Sigma Theta</a>, arrived in 1980, closely followed by its rival, <a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Alpha Delta Chi is a Christian Sisterhood at UNA.  The sisters aim to strengthen the spiritual lives of the members, serve the campus and community, promote scholastic achievement, and provide spiritual fellowship from the community in Christ.  The group functions as a student organization outside the Greek system.</p>
<h3>Greek system today</h3>
<p>President Guillot's decision to organize a UNA Greek system initially was greeted with strong opposition by some segments of the administration.  Previous attempts to establish a Greek community had been successfully resisted for years. Kappa Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>School colors</h3>
<p>[[Image:UNA-flag.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A UNA cheerleader and boosters display purple and gold Lion flags following a UNA touchdown at [[Braly Municipal Stadium]]. While these colors have been associated with the university for almost a century or even longer, no one ever has determined who or what inspired them.]]Purple and gold are the school colors of the University of North Alabama.  While they are a ubiquitous sight on campus and especially at UNA athletic events, no one has ever ascertained who or what inspired their adoption.  Little in the school archives accounts for the origin of these colors, according to Cecil Nabors, a UNA archivist and associate professor. All that is certain is that the 1912 yearbook, published the same year as inauguration of the football team, was named the &#x201c;Purple and Gold.&quot;</p>
<h3>&quot;Lion Pride&quot; and &quot;Pride Rock&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Lion Pride&quot; is a term frequently used by members of the UNA community to describe the intense level of commitment to school traditions and activities reflected among students, alumni and friends of the university. </p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is this level of commitment more strongly expressed than in the university's Pride Rock tradition, which began in 1994. Pride Rock is a 60-pound, engraved granite stone bearing the actual paw print of Leo II, UNA's second live lion mascot.  Placed just behind the north end zone of all UNA home games, Pride Rock is touched by players as they file past on their way to the field.  Pride Rock serves not only as a motivational tool for the players but also as a tangible expression of the deep well of pride, community and tradition associated with the University of North Alabama and particularly with its athletic program.</p>
<h3>UNA's mascot</h3>
<h4>Leos I and II</h4>
<p><a>thumb|pix224|left|The George H. Carroll Lion Habitat is the home of Leo III and Una, UNA's live mascots.</a>On July 22, 1974, former UNA president Dr. Robert M. Guillot brought a 35-pound lion cub to the campus and Leo spent the next 14 years &quot;roaring&quot; the school to victory. The original Leo died on Jan. 20, 1988, and a great outpouring of support from <a>the Shoals</a> community resulted in Leo II being brought to UNA in July 1988. Leo II lived in the compound that once housed the original Leo and grew to a weight of more than 600 pounds at eleven years of age. In 1997, Leo II was selected as the nation's &quot;Second Best Mascot&quot; by <a>Sports Illustrated</a>. He died in February, 2000.</p>
<h4>Leo III and Una</h4>

Leo III and Una, born on November 18, 2002, now reside on the campus in the  <a>George H. Carroll Lion Habitat</a>.  UNA's other mascots, students who don lion costumes (one male one female) to cheer the Lions and entertain the crowd, also represents the school at athletic games and other university functions.  Tryouts are held each year and the identity of the students are kept secret for as long as possible.</p>
<h3>UNA's &quot;Pride of Dixie&quot; Marching Band</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <a>Pride of Dixie Marching Band</a> was begun in 1949. The Marching Band has represented the university at many different events during the past 60 years, perhaps most notably performing for President Jimmy Carter during his historic 1980 visit to neighboring Tuscumbia.</p>
<p>The band also appeared in the award-winning movie, <a>Blue Sky</a>, starring <a>Jessica Lange</a>, <a>Tommy Lee Jones</a> and <a>Powers Booth</a>. The Marching Band also has recorded a CD with famed musician and producer <a>Jimmy Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>With more than 210 members, the group is the largest organization on campus and serves as a major contributor to school spirit, especially at athletic events.  The UNA Marching Band performs at all home <a>football</a> games, local <a>parades</a> and travels the state performing in exhibition at high school competitions.  They are known for precision marching and drill design, while entertaining with strongly played <a>jazz</a> standards.</p>
<h3>Step Sing</h3>
<p>In the spring, Step Sing is a well-attended event in <a>Norton Auditorium</a> sponsored by the University Program Council featuring take-offs of <a>musical comedy</a> production numbers by campus organizations. Money raised from ticket sales supports the local United Way.</p>

<p>In the mid-1960s, the University of North Alabama, then known as Florence State College, was the site of a bare-knuckle debate between then-Governor <a>George C. Wallace</a> and Senator Ed Horton, a North Alabama state legislator and a vocal opponent of the governor's attempt to amend the Alabama Constitution so that he could run for an unprecedented second term.  The debate is outlined in <a>Dan T. Carter's</a> book &quot;The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics.&quot;</p>
