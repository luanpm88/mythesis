<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Dalian University of Technology (Dalian Institute of Technology before 1987) was founded in 1949. It has grown significantly since then and in the 1960s DUT had developed into one of the key universities in China. As the largest institution of higher education in Liaoning Province in terms of student enrollment, Dalian University of Technology has quite a good reputation in both engineering and science programs. The university also offers programs in business, liberal arts, and management. It has 19 schools, 54 bachelor's degree programs, 147 master degree programs, and 107 doctorate degree programs.  With the support of &#x201c;the 985 Project&#x201d; and &#x201c;the 211 Project&#x201d; funded by the State Ministry of Education, <a>Liaoning Province</a>, and <a>Dalian City</a>, DUT is engaged in grasping the historic opportunity of rejuvenating the old northeast industrial base and carrying out a talent-training strategy in the hope of building DUT into a world-famous research-oriented university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Previously known as Dalian University, DUT was founded in 1949 by Chinese Communist Party just before the birth of P.R. China. In 1950, the School of Engineering separated from Dalian University and became Dalian University of Technology. Due to the rearrangement of the Ministry of Education to enhance development of education and construction of new born China, several departments were transferred to other universities. Meanwhile, scholars from other university also came to enlarge the departments of Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering. The university started to expend right after the rearrangement, attracting more scholars and funding. To ensure future growth, the then-headmaster, Bochuan Qu, strategically moved the university's main campus to the bay area of suburban Dalian. Experienced consistent growth of over half a century, and having gone through the persistent efforts of several generations, DUT has developed into a comprehensive university with a primary emphasis still on science and technology.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>DUT is the home to three national key laboratories, <a>State Key Laboratory of Structral Analysis for Industrial Equipment</a>, <a>State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering</a>, <a>State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals</a> and the home to three Education Ministry Key Laboratories, Key Laboratory of  Materials Modification by Laser, Ion and Electron Beams, Key Laboratory of Technology Precision and Non-traditional Machining and  Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Technology. It also owns one National-level Technical Transfer Center. </p>
<p>There are 8 members of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Science and 26 Changjiang Scholar professors Members of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Science:  Dahong Qiu, Wanxie Zhong, Gengdong Cheng, Liding Wang, Gao Lin, Guofan Zhao, Zongtuo Wang, Jinzhong Yang</p>

<p>Since 1978, DUT has won almost 1,000 awards for its achievements in scientific and technological researches, eleven of which were National Natural Science Awards, nine National Invention Awards, and 30 awards in science and technology.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Due to the relative young age compared to other top-tier universities in China, DUT campus has a modern look. The total area of the university is 4550 acres.The campus is beautiful and maintains a mixure of classical and new buildings. Many are equipped with comprehensive teaching and researching facilities and laboratories. The main campus also includes multiple sport sites, hospital, and an international hotel. The previous Chairman Jiang Zemin once visited DUT and said that this was a great place for studying and doing research.   The Liu Changchun sports stadium held the international female volleyball tournament in 2004. In 2010, three brand new buildings were appended to the west of the existing campus, including a state-of-the-art library, named after the former headmaster and academician, Qian Lingxi.</p>
