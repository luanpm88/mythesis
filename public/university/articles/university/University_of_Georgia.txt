<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Antebellum History</h4>
<p>The University of Georgia was incorporated on January 27, 1785, by the <a>Georgia General Assembly</a>, which had given its trustees, the <em>Senatus Academicus</em> of the University of Georgia, 40,000 <a>acre</a>s (160&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) for the purposes of founding a &#x201c;college or <a>seminary</a> of learning.&#x201d; The <em>Senatus Academicus</em> was composed of the Board of Visitors and the Board of Trustees with the <a>Georgia Senate</a> presiding over those two boards. The first meeting of the university's board of trustees was held in <a>Augusta, Georgia</a> on February 13, 1786. The meeting installed its first president, <a>Abraham Baldwin</a>, a native of <a>Connecticut</a> and graduate of <a>Yale University</a>. The college was not immediately established and until it was portions of the original land tracts were used for other purposes or sold to raise $7,463.75 by 1798.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1799, the <em>Senatus Academicus</em> met again in <a>Louisville, Georgia</a> and decided that the time was right to officially begin the University. During this meeting 633 <a>acre</a>s (2.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) on the banks of the <a>Oconee River</a> were chosen on which the university was to be built. This tract of land, now a part of the <a>consolidated city&#x2013;county</a> of <a>Clarke County, Georgia</a> and <a>Athens, Georgia</a> was then part of <a>Jackson County</a>. The meeting also established a new president of the university naming <a>Josiah Meigs</a>, another Yale graduate, to the post. The first classes were held in 1801, in what was called the <a>Franklin College</a>, named in honor of <a>Benjamin Franklin</a>. The first graduating class graduated on May 31, 1804.</p>
<p>The <em>Senatus Academicus</em> convened for the last time in <a>Dothan, Georgia</a>, from November 3, 1859, through November 5, 1859, after which it was replaced with a Board of Trustees which reported to the <a>Georgia General Assembly</a> which is composed of the <a>Georgia House of Representatives</a> and the <a>Georgia Senate</a>.</p>
<h4>The Civil War Era</h4>
<p>During the <a>American Civil War</a>, the University closed in October 1863 and reopened in January 1866 with an enrollment of seventy-eight students including veterans utilizing an award of $300 granted by the General Assembly to injured soldiers younger than thirty.</p>
<h4>20th Century</h4>
<p>With students limited to white males for the first century of its history, UGA began educating female students during the summer of 1903. Women were not admitted as full-time undergraduates until 1918. Before official admission of women to the University, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions. The first woman to earn such a degree was <a>Mary Lyndon</a>. She received a <a>Master of Arts</a> degree in 1914. <a>Mary Creswell</a> earned the first <a>undergraduate</a> degree in June 1919, a <a>B.S.</a> in <a>Home Economics</a>. Two UGA <a>dormitories</a> are named after these graduates: <a>Creswell Hall</a> and <a>Mary Lyndon Hall</a>.</p>
<p>Racial integration was achieved in 1961, with the admission of <a>Hamilton E. Holmes</a> and <a>Charlayne Hunter</a> after notable tension with the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>. In 2001, on the fortieth anniversary of their having first registered for classes, the University renamed a prominent campus building in their honor: <a>Holmes-Hunter Academic Building</a>. Although Hunter and Holmes were the first <a>African-American</a> students to <a>matriculate</a> at UGA, <a>Mary Frances Early</a> became the first African-American graduate by earning her <a>master&#x2019;s</a> (MMEd) in music education in 1962. In 1963, <a>Chester Davenport</a> became the first African-American admitted to the <a>UGA School of Law</a> and its first African-American graduate (<a>LL.B.</a> 1966). A decade later, <a>Sharon Tucker</a> was the first female African-American law graduate, earning her <a>J.D.</a> in 1974.</p>
<h4>Recent Years</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the main campus in winter.</a>The University has seen its academic reputation rise markedly since Georgia's <a>HOPE Scholarship</a> program was started in 1993. The school has grown both in size and reputation. The merit-based scholarship allows any resident of the state of Georgia to attend any public college in the state without paying tuition, provided they maintain a 3.0 GPA. The average <a>SAT</a> for incoming freshmen in 2010 was 1300+, and national rankings for the school have risen consistently. UGA is designated as both a <a>land-grant</a> and <a>sea-grant university</a>. and South Campus. In the last decade, new facilities have added &quot;East Campus&quot; to the traditional map. This area includes new apartment-like dorms called East Campus Village. Adjacent is the newest and fourth dining hall on campus called The Village Summit at Joe Frank Harris Commons. Also on East campus is the Performing and Visual Arts Complex, the <a>Ramsey Center for Physical Activity</a> and the new <a>Lamar Dodd School of Art</a>. &quot;West Campus&quot; is a term used as an informal reference to the area where many of the freshman <a>residence hall</a>s are located; most UGA freshman live in one of the high rise dorms in this area.</p>
<p>UGA's oldest permanent building, Old College is modeled on <a>Yale University</a>&#x2019;s Connecticut Hall. UGA&#x2019;s North Campus contains the picturesque historic buildings&mdash;such as the Chapel, New College, <a>Demosthenian</a> and the <a>Phi Kappa</a> Halls, Park Hall, Meigs Hall, and the President&#x2019;s office&mdash;as well as modern additions such as the Law School and the Main Library. The dominant architectural themes are <a>Federal</a>&mdash;the older buildings&mdash;and <a>Greco-Roman</a> <a>Classical</a>/<a>Antebellum</a> style. UGA&#x2019;s North Campus has also been designated an <a>arboretum</a> by the <a>State of Georgia</a>.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|153px|The UGA Arch</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable North Campus fixture, though, is the cast-iron gateway that stands at its main entrance. Known as &quot;The Arch&quot; (but often erroneously pluralized to &quot;The Arches&quot;), the structure was patterned after the <a>Seal of the State of Georgia</a>, and has faced historic downtown <a>Athens</a> ever since it was erected in the 1850s. Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government, the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the <a>Georgia Constitution</a>'s three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal. There is a superstition about walking through The Arch.  It is said that if you walk under the Arch before receiving your diploma, you will not graduate from UGA on time. Another legend claims that should you walk through The Arch as a freshman, you will become sterile.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|Path on North Campus leading to the Arch and downtown Athens</a> Dividing North and South Campus is the &quot;central campus&quot; area, home of the University Bookstore, Tate Student Center, and Miller Learning Center, as well as <a>Sanford Stadium</a>, home of the football team. Adjacent to the stadium is a bridge that crosses Tanyard Creek and is the traditional crossover into South Campus, home of most of the science and agricultural classroom buildings. Further south and east, across East Campus Road, is East Campus, home of the <a>Ramsey Center</a>, the East Campus Village (<a>apartment</a>-style <a>dormitories</a>), and several fine arts facilities, including the <a>Georgia Museum of Art</a> and School of Music. A new facility for the art school opened its doors in the Fall of 2008. This new state of the art facility replaced the elder that was placed on North Campus.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the campus is the &quot;west campus&quot; area. This extends from the corner of Britain Avenue and Lumpkin Street in the south to Waddell and Wray streets in the north. It is bordered along the east by Lumpkin Street and on the west by Church Street south of Baxter Street and Florida Avenue to the north. Located on the south end are several dormitories including the Hill Community, Oglethorpe Hall, Creswell Hall, Brumby Hall and Russell Hall. Also located here are Legion Field and Pool, which are recreational facilities. On the north end are several fraternity houses, a parking deck, and several university administration offices. Some of the fraternities were asked to relocate in early 2006 to make room for new University building projects. University property and private property are dispersed throughout West Campus, and at several points University buildings are adjacent to private residences and businesses.</p>
<h3>Miller Learning Center</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Zell B. Miller Student Learning Center and the adjacent memorial garden</a> The $43.6 million dollar <a>Zell B. Miller</a> Learning Center (MLC) has been the largest academic building on the University of Georgia campus since its opening in the autumn of 2003 when it was originally called the Student Learning Center (Most students still refer to it as the SLC). Located at the heart of the UGA campus, it houses both <a>classroom</a> space and <a>library</a> space in close proximity.</p>
<p>On the inside is a <a>technological</a> space that includes two dozen classrooms capable of seating 2,400 students and equipped with the latest technology, from <a>computer</a> connections to projection equipment to laptop connections.

<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Rhodes Scholars</h3>
<p>As of 2008, twenty-one UGA students have been named <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> including <a>Eugene T. Booth</a> and <a>Hervey M. Cleckley</a>. UGA student Deep Shah and alumna Kate Vyborny were elected in 2008 with the University being the only public institution with two scholars and one of only six schools with multiple scholars.   In 2010, Tracy Yang was named a <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>.</p>
<h3>Study abroad program</h3>
<p>The University of Georgia began its first year-round residential study-abroad program at Oxford University in England, where students and faculty live in a three-story Victorian house located in the heart of the city of Oxford and owned by UGA. Founded in 1987 the Oxford study-abroad program began as a summer option and expanded to include spring in 1994. With the purchase of the house in 1999 &#x2013; evidence of UGA's strong commitment to study abroad &#x2013; the program became available throughout the academic year.</p>
<p>UGA now ranks among the top five American universities for the number of students studying abroad, with more than 100 programs in over 50 countries. UGA has faculty study abroad programs on every continent, including Antarctica. Additionally, UGA has signed agreements with several outside <a>study abroad organization</a>s: the <a>American Institute For Foreign Study</a>; <a>Australearn</a>; the Institute for Study Abroad (IFSA), <a>Butler University</a>; <a>International Studies Abroad</a> (ISA); the <a>The School for Field Studies</a>; the <a>University of New Orleans</a>, <a>Innsbruck</a> International Summer School. Currently, just over 2,000 students, or 6% of the entire campus enrollment (graduate and undergraduate) study abroad in a given year. During the past five years, the number of students participating in study abroad programs has nearly doubled. Approximately 30 percent of the members of recent graduating classes had a study abroad experience.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  <a>right|thumb|University of Georgia Mascot Hairy Dawg</a> <a>left|200px|thumb|The UGA athletics logo</a></p>
<p>The University of Georgia <a>varsity athletic teams</a> participate in the <a>NCAA's</a> <a>Division I-A</a> as a member of the <a>Southeastern Conference</a>. Since the 1997-1998 season, UGA has seven top ten rankings in the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a> (NACDA) <a>Director's Cup</a>, a numerical ranking based on the success of universities in all varsity sports. The University has won national championships in <a>football</a>, women's <a>gymnastics</a>, women's equestrian (2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010), <a>baseball</a>, <a>tennis</a> (men's and women's), golf (men's and women's), and women's swimming and diving. The Gym Dogs, the University's women's gymnastics team, are the current defending NCAA champions (having placed first in the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 seasons) They have a NCAA leading 10 National Championships in Gymnastics.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs' most historic rivalry is with <a>Auburn</a>, referred to as the &quot;<a>Deep South's Oldest Rivalry</a>&quot; in reference to the first football game played between the two teams in 1892 and the more than one hundred meetings since. However, major rivalries have grown since, including <a>rivalry</a> with the <a>Florida Gators</a>, nearby <a>Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a>, and the <a>Tennessee Volunteers</a>. <a>right|thumb|University of Georgia Ice Hockey</a> The University also boasts several non-varsity sports, including wrestling, men's and women's soccer, crew, ultimate frisbee, rugby, lacrosse, and ice hockey. Georgia's men's soccer team received a bid to play in the NIRSA Club National Championship for the first time in 2007. Several Varsity sports are duplicated with non-varsity teams, such as women's tennis. Georgia's men's lacrosse team has won the South Eastern Lacrosse Conference three times, in 1998, 2007, and 2008, and received an automatic bid to the MCLA national tournament; while the women's team earned an at-large bid to the WDIA National Tournament in 2007.</p>
<p>Most recently, many have acclaimed UGA's athletic program for implementing a program that fines student-athletes for unexcused absences in class. And, for the first time in school history, more than 50% of student-athlete GPAs were over 3.0. In addition, many other universities are looking to UGA's plan as a model.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p> The first Greek letter fraternity to charter at the university was <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> in 1865, and the first sorority was <a>Phi Mu</a> in 1921. There are 17 sororities from the Panhellenic Council and 26 <a>IFC</a> fraternities. Students with Greek affiliation made up 23 percent of the undergraduate student body as of 2007, including 21% of the males and 24% of the females.  Perhaps the most prominent features of Greek Life at the University are the large, mostly Greek Revival, mansions maintained by the national fraternities and sororities as chapter houses lining South Milledge Avenue and South Lumpkin Street and the ubiquitous t-shirts worn by students on campus commemorating Greek social events.</p>
<p>In 2005 the University announced that five of the fraternities on Lumpkin Street would need to be relocated by June 2008. The school plans to build academic buildings on the house sites, which the University owns and the fraternities lease. UGA offered to relocate the Lumpkin fraternities and two others to River Road (a former site of several fraternities who were moved out in the 90's), located on east campus. Kappa Alpha and Chi Phi did not take up the offer and have decided to move off campus.  Sigma Chi has opted to keep their location next to the Student Learning Center (now the Zell B. Miller Learning Center).  In October 2008, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Tau Epsilon Phi and Sigma Nu broke ground for the new Greek Park located on River Road. The four new houses will be complete August 2009 for fall rush. All groups have signed 30 year leases with an option to renew for an additional 30 years.</p>
<h3>Fight songs</h3>
<p>The University of Georgia <a>fight song</a>, <em>Glory, Glory</em> is sung to the tune of &quot;<a>The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>,&quot; the familiar song that traditionally begins with the words &quot;Glory, glory hallelujah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glory, glory to old Georgia!&lt;br /&gt; Glory, glory to old Georgia! &lt;br /&gt; Glory, glory to old Georgia! &lt;br /&gt; G-E-O-R-G-I-A! (Unofficially: And to hell with Georgia Tech/the current opponent)!&quot; &lt;br /&gt; Glory, glory to old Georgia! &lt;br /&gt; Glory, glory to old Georgia! &lt;br /&gt; Glory, glory to old Georgia! &lt;br /&gt; G-E-O-R-G-I-A! (Unofficially: And to hell with Georgia Tech/the current opponent)!&quot;</p>
<p>And also &quot;Hail to Georgia&quot;</p>
<p>Hail to Georgia down in Dixie!&lt;br /&gt; A college honor'd fair and true&lt;br /&gt; The red and black is her standard, proudly it waves,&lt;br /&gt; Streaming today and the ages through.&lt;br /&gt; She's the fairest in the southland!&lt;br /&gt; We'll pledge our love to her for aye;&lt;br /&gt; To that college dear, we'll ring a cheer.&lt;br /&gt; All hail to dear old U-G-A!</p>
