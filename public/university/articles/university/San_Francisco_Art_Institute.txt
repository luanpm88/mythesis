<h2>History</h2>
<p>The San Francisco Art Association (SFAA) was founded in 1871 and it opened the San Francisco School of Design in February 1874 under the direction of landscape painter Virgil Macey Williams.  In 1893 the name was changed to California School of Design and the association affiliated with the <a>University of California</a> and inherited the mansion of <a>Mark Hopkins</a> on <a>Nob Hill</a>. Its museum functions continued under the title of the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.</p>
<p>The fire following the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> destroyed both the mansion and the school.  A year later, the school was rebuilt on the site of the old mansion and renamed the San Francisco Institute of Art.  In 1916 the SFAA merged with the San Francisco Society of Artists and assumed directorship of the <a>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>, then located in the <a>Palace of Fine Arts</a>, a relic of the <a>Panama-Pacific International Exposition</a>.  The school was also renamed the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA). In 1926 the school moved to its present location at 800 Chestnut Street in San Francisco. In 1961 the school took its modern name, the San Francisco Art Institute.</p>
<p>In 1969, a new addition to the building by <a>Paffard Keatinge-Clay</a> added  studio space, a large theater/lecture hall, outdoor amphitheater, galleries, and cafe.</p>
<p>On or about February 4, 2009, a group of SFAI Trustees authorized a declaration of &quot;financial exigency&quot; for the school. Under SFAI's contract with faculty, financial exigency is &quot;the critical and urgent need for the Institute to reorder its expenditures in such a way as to retain solvency.&quot; Pursuant to the claim of financial exigency, on or about February 17, 2009, President Bratton issued layoff notices to nearly 25% of SFAI's tenured faculty. The affected faculty had taught at SFAI from 11 to over 31 years.  Many of the teachers were of varying artistic calibre, having been hired at a peak time of financial buoyancy. Students and alumni quickly organized to protest the layoffs, and questioned certain decisions and acts made in connection with the layoffs.  Student and alumni activists launched an online wiki, and in May 2009 launched a website to keep the SFAI community and other concerned members of the public updated on recent developments. An accountant hired by the faculty union concluded that financial exigency did not exist,    and students, alumni and faculty continue to challenge the layoffs.</p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>Founded by <a>Ansel Adams</a> in 1945, the Photography Department was the first program of its kind dedicated to exploring photography as a fine art medium.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>In 1966, the SFAI organized an exhibition of rock and roll posters.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, SFAI was one of the centers of the San Francisco <a>punk rock</a> and <a>new wave</a> music scene. Among the many artist musicians who studied at SFAI are Jerry Garcia, guitarist in Grateful Dead; Dave Getz, drummer for Big Brother and the Holding Company and Country Joe and the Fish; Prairie Prince and Michael Cotten of the Tubes; Debora Iyall and Frank Zinkavage of Romeo Void; Freddy (aka Fritz) of <a>the Mutants</a>; Penelope Houston of the Avengers, Nathan Burazer and Jonathan Holland of Tussle; Cliff Hengst and Scott Hewicker of Troll; and <a>Devendra Banhart</a>; Robert Earl Davis, band leader of The Earl Brothers.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>SFAI maintained a small <a>student housing</a> program in the MacArthur neighborhood of the <a>Presidio of San Francisco</a> from 2002 to 2007.  Students were housed primarily in semi-furnished townhouse apartments built in the 1960s with space for approximately 45 students.  During the 2006/2007 academic year, some apartments in the Baker Beach neighborhood were used with space for an additional 20 students.  In August 2007, SFAI transitioned to a more traditional student housing model and converted a 1907 hotel at 140 Mason Street in Union Square to an unnamed residence hall. The Union Square property could house up to 125 students.  In Spring 2010, SFAI announced that its housing program would be located at Sutter Hall at 717 Sutter Street.  The location is currently operated by USA Student Residences, a company that specializes in hostel and residence hall style accommodations for international students.  Prior to 2002, students typically found housing on their own with some guidance from the institution, though at one time SFAI owned a small number of apartment units near its <a>Russian Hill</a> campus.</p>
<h2>Exhibitions and Public Programs</h2>
<p>Students are given direct access to exhibitions, lectures, symposia, films, and other unique interdisciplinary events. An integral part of campus life, such events connect students to the larger community of artists, art, and contemporary ideas. The <a>Walter and McBean Galleries</a> (on the 800 Chestnut Street campus) house exhibitions, workshops, and other alternative and experimental avenues for presenting work by international contemporary artists. Students also have the opportunity to show their own work in a number of spots on SFAI's two campuses, including the <a>Diego Rivera Gallery</a>.</p>
