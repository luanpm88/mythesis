<h2>History</h2>
<p>On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor <a>Thomas Carney</a> signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (160,000 m&#x00b2;) of land.  If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, <a>Emporia</a> instead of Lawrence would get the university.</p>
<p>The site selected for the university was a hill known as Mount Oread, which was owned by former Kansas Governor <a>Charles L. Robinson</a>.  Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the  site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere. </p>
<p>Work on the first college building was begun in September 1865.</p>
<p>In 2007, the City Management and Urban Policy program at the University of Kansas was ranked 1st in the nation by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>'s &quot;America's Best Graduate Schools&quot;. The report also recognized several programs for ranking in the top 25 among public universities.</p>

<h2>Student activities</h2>
<h3>Student Government</h3>
<p>The <a>University of Kansas Student Senate</a> represents KU students to University administrators, and to the government locally, state-wide, and nationally. Senate oversees student services including the Student Recreation Fitness Center, Watkins Health Center, Safe Ride, and more.</p>
<p>Student Senate allocates a budget of more than $23 million each year paid for by required campus fees(each KU student enrolled in more than 6 credit hours pay around $430 per semester). It is up to the Student Senate to decide how to allocate this money based on how best to represent student needs. </p>
<p>The members of Student Senate are elected in Student Senate elections each April. In the elections, coalitions form plans on what student services they will focus on as well as propose new ideas they want to see happen at KU. The David A. Ambler Recreation Fitness Center and the Multicultural Resource Center, for example, were Student Senate-initiated projects.</p>
<p>The 1983-1984 Student Senate election was marred by vote tampering on the part of the administration. Dennis &quot;Boog&quot; Highberger (running on the Costume Party ticket, was the Mayor of Lawrence in 2008) was only able to take office in January following a legal challenge.</p>

The team plays at <a>Allen Fieldhouse</a>. Kansas has counted among its coaches Dr. <a>James Naismith</a> (the inventor of basketball and only coach in Kansas history to have a losing record), Basketball Hall of Fame inductee <a>Phog Allen</a> (&quot;the Father of basketball coaching&quot;), <a>Roy Williams</a> of the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, and former NBA Champion <a>Detroit Pistons</a> coach <a>Larry Brown</a>. In addition, legendary <a>University of Kentucky</a> coach <a>Adolph Rupp</a> played for KU's 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams. In addition, NCAA Hall of Fame <a>University of North Carolina</a> Coach <a>Dean Smith</a> played for KU's 1952 NCAA Championship team. Both Rupp and Smith played under Phog Allen.  Allen also coached future hall of fame coaches Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller.  Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), which started what is now the NCAA Tournament.  The Tournament began in 1939 under the NABC and the next year was handed off to the newly formed NCAA.</p>
<p><a>Lew Perkins</a>, previously at <a>Connecticut</a>, replaced <a>Al Bohl</a> as the university's athletic director in 2003. Under Perkins's administration, the department's budget has increased from $27.2 <a>million</a> in 2003 (10th in the conference) to currently over $50 million thanks in large part to money raised from a new priority seating policy at Allen Fieldhouse, a new $26.67 million eight-year contract with <a>Adidas</a> replacing an existing contract with <a>Nike</a>, and a new $40.2 million seven-year contract with <a>ESPN</a> Regional Television. The additional funds have brought improvements to the university, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Booth Family Hall of Athletics addition to Allen Fieldhouse;</li>
  <li>Brand new offices and lounges for the women's basketball program;</li>
  <li>Brand new scoreboard and batting facility for the baseball field;</li>
