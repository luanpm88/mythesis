<p><strong>Central Washington University</strong>, often abbreviated <strong>CWU</strong>, is a public university  in <a>Ellensburg, Washington</a> in the <a>United States</a>.This location was selected by the state legislature as a consolation prize after Ellensburg lost its bid to be state capital. The university originally opened in the late 19th century as a teacher's college, which is still one of the primary majors taken there. Central Washington University is located about  north of <a>Yakima, Washington</a> on <a>Interstate 82</a>, and  east-southeast of <a>Seattle, Washington</a> on <a>Interstate 90</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Central Washington University originally opened up as Washington State Normal School in 1891.  The school was founded to educate future elementary and junior high teachers.  In 1893, the Washington State Normal School's first building was constructed and given the name Barge Hall. Before 1894, classes were held at the Washington Public School in Ellensburg.</p>
<p>The school's name changed to Central Washington College of Education in 1937, Central Washington State College in 1961, and finally to Central Washington University in 1977.  It continues to be one of the fastest growing universities in the state of Washington. Dr. James L. Gaudino  is the current president, having replaced Dr. Jerilyn S. McIntyre on January 1, 2009 after a yearlong search for a new president.</p>
<p>On April 17, 1974 <a>serial killer</a> <a>Ted Bundy</a> abducted Susan Rancourt from the campus by asking her to help him load books into his Volkswagen Beetle. Two other students reported seeing him around campus in the days leading up to her disappearance.</p>
<p>In 2008, Wildcat softball players Mallory Holtman and Liz Wallace helped carry injured opponent of Western Oregon University around the bases after she hit her first-ever career home run and injured herself running around the bases. CWU lost the game, ending the Wildcats' season. The story received national attention and the trio appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, <a>CBS</a>, <a>CNN</a>, and <a>ESPN</a>. They also won an <a>ESPY</a> award for Best Moment in Sports in 2008, were featured in Sports Illustrated, and are part of a national billboard campaign promoting sportsmanship by the Foundation for A Better Life.</p>
<p>In 1978, CWU began its campus radio station <a>KCWU</a> (88.1 The Burg) that has since flourished into a state-of-the-art broadcast facility.</p>
<p>The university was home to <a>Washoe</a>, believed to be the first nonhuman to acquire human <a>language</a>, from 1980 to October 30, 2007.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> CWU students, alumni, and Varsity athletes are known as the &quot;<a>Wildcats</a>&quot; and their colors are Crimson and Black. CWU is part of <a>NCAA</a> Division II and is part of the <a>Great Northwest Athletic Conference</a>. The Wildcats Sports are as follows in seasonal order.</p>
<p>Men's: (Fall) Football, Cross Country, (Winter) Basketball, Swimming (Spring) Baseball, Track &amp; Field.</p>
<p>Women's: (Fall) Soccer, Cross Country, Volleyball (Winter) Basketball, Swimming (Spring) Softball, Track &amp; Field.</p>
<p>Championships:1995 Football NAIA Div 2</p>
<p>The University used to have competitive swimming and wrestling teams.  However, the university addressed their budget problems within the athletic department by eliminating these programs in 2004.  This was done despite the fact that these programs were two of the least expensive sports in the department.  The men's swim team has won four NAIA championships and the women's team won two NAIA championships.  The wrestling team also won two NAIA championships of its own and produced 10 national champions as well as 26 All-Americans. Although each of these programs were still competitive forces, the school's athletic department opted to cut the program following the 2003-2004 seasons.</p>
<p>The wrestling team was cut with the University citing a lack of regional competition and a lack of conference affiliation. Despite an outcry by students, alumni and fans, the university stuck with its decision despite being offered a wrestling only membership by the <a>Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference</a> (which is the only Division II conference sponsoring wrestling), and the student body agreeing to increase the schools activity fees to help sponsor the sport, and an abundance of Regional competition at the Division I and NAIA level. Those that still compete on the wrestling team have to try out at the club level which competes in the less prestigious National College Wrestling Association in its three team Northwest Conference.</p>
<p>Football garnered much attention as being one of the most successful NCAA Division II teams in the northwest.  In 2006, they moved to the  <a>North Central Conference</a>, because the <a>Great Northwest Athletic Conference</a> announced it would discontinue its participation in football following the 2005 season. The football team shares an intense rivalry with <a>Western Washington University</a> (who will also be joining the NCC in 2006). Recently they've been competing in a game called the Battle in Seattle taking place at Seattle's <a>Qwest Field</a> before the even more traditional Cascade Cup game, although because of conference scheduling the two games were combined starting 2006.  In 2008, The <a>Great Northwest Athletic conference</a> reinstated football, and Central Washington along with Western Washington rejoined the conference, so the previous format of the Battle in Seattle being played at Qwest Field and the Cascade Cup was contested in Ellensburg.  In 2009, <a>Western Washington University</a> disbanded its football team.  In 2009, Central Washington University posted a perfect 11-0 record, the only Division II team to post a clean slate in 2009.</p>
<p>Central also offers a variety of club sports, of which, the men's rugby team has had the most success.  The University established a men's rugby in 1972.  As a club sport, the rugby team has been able to play against bigger university, such as, the University of Washington, Washington State University, University of Oregon, and Oregon State University.  Rugby at Central has surprisingly been quite successful against these and other much larger schools, and has gained the University national recognition due to its high level of success in the national playoffs.  Several of their most impressive accomplishments include making the Sweet 16 in 1998 and 2001.  In 2001, Central defeated North Carolina 52-17 in their Sweet 16 match, and eventually lost to Penn State 14-12 in the Elite 8 (Penn State went on to play in the championship match).  In 2007, the men's rugby team was ranked as high as 10th in the nation.</p>
