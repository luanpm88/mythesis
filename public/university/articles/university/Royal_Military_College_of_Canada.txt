<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Awards are granted to outstanding cadets:</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Centres and Institutes</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Rank</h2>
<p>RMC refers to its students as &quot;Fourth Year&quot;, &quot;Third Year&quot;, &quot;Second year&quot;, and &quot;First year&quot;. Most cadets consider first year to be the most difficult because of the rules and restrictions developed to help students transition from civilian to <a>officer cadet</a>. However, the third year is generally considered to be the hardest academically.</p>
<p>Officer cadets are responsible for the discipline, progress, and efficiency of their wing, squadron or flight and carry out service duties such as duty officer. Within the years, cadets can hold positions of increasing responsibility with a cadet rank that may include:</p>
<p>&lt;center&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<h2>Squadrons of the Cadet Wing</h2>
<p>The undergraduate student body, known as the Cadet Wing, is sub-divided into 14 smaller groupings called <em>Squadrons</em>, of approximately 70 <a>officer cadets</a>, under the guidance and supervision of senior cadets. Squadrons are subdivided into flights and sections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dates given are for the current organization of the wing.  For example 1 Squadron was the original squadron at RMC, residing in the same building, the Stone Frigate,  as the Old Eighteen.  This means that 1 squadron has been around since 1876, but has only been called Hudson Squadron since 1948.</p>
<h2>Admission requirements</h2>
<p>To be eligible to enter RMC, candidates must meet the course requirements for one of the undergraduate programs in <a>Kingston, Ontario</a> or the preparatory year or first year in <a>Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, they must meet the <a>Canadian Forces</a>' general admission conditions (officer):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be a <a>Canadian citizen</a> or a <a>Canadian Permanent resident</a> (however, those in this category are only allowed to attend the military college when a proven specific need exists in the forces in which they feel the need to draw from non-Canadian citizens)</li>
  <li>Be 17 years old on January 1 of the year of enrollment</li>
  <li>Pass the <a>medical</a></li>
  <li>Pass the pre-enrollment tests</li>
  <li>Pass the enhanced reliability check</li>
</ul>
<p>The college recruits students who demonstrate promise in the areas which correspond to the four pillars of academics, military, athletics, and bilingualism (French and English). In addition, RMC gives extra weight to those applicants with second-language skills, although this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>The application process, which is independent from that of the Ontario Universities' Application Centre, uses a separate application form. The Selection Board informs applicants no later than mid-May. Applicants are accepted into the <a>Science</a>, <a>Engineering</a> or <a>Arts</a> Program.</p>
<h2>Training plans</h2>
<p>There are several full-time admission options for an education at RMCC.</p>
<h3>ROTP</h3>
<p>The <strong>Regular Officer Training Plan</strong> is a conditional scholarship offered to selected applicants. In addition to a university education, Officer Cadets receive military training, occupation training and second language training and a career after graduation. The full-time salary includes full dental care, as well as vacation with full pay. Upon successful completion of ROTP, Officer Cadets are awarded a university degree and granted commissions as Officers in the Canadian Forces. Normally, graduates serve at least five years with the <a>Canadian Forces</a>. The application deadline to ROTP is in January for Basic Officer Training in July and admission the following September.</p>
<p>Typically, successful applicants enter the Canadian Military College (CMC) System as an Officer Cadet, where they receive an education that balances academics, <a>leadership</a>, bilingualism and <a>athletics</a>. If the choice of programme is not offered, such as <a>Nursing</a>, <a>Physiotherapy</a> and <a>Pharmacy</a>, or the candidate wishes to attend another university, successful applicants would be eligible to apply to any Canadian university where books, lab fees and student fees are covered, and students receive a monthly salary under the Civilian University ROTP.</p>
<h3>RETP</h3>
<p>The <strong>Reserve Entry Training Plan</strong> is an education the same as the ROTP but is paid for by the student (not a scholarship). The students also do not draw a salary, however they are not obligated to five years of service after completion. Reserve Entry cadets are, however, paid considerably more than the regular ROTP Officer Cadet salary during their summer training months. They are also entitled to this pay if they attend &quot;Duty/Varsity&quot; away trips (For example, an away game of women's soccer).</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UTPNCM: <strong>University Training Plan - Non Commissioned Members</strong> for Non Commissioned members of the Canadian Forces to earn a degree and then serve as officers.</li>
  <li>IBDP: <strong>Initial Baccalaureate Degree Program</strong>, a <a>Baccalaureate</a> program.</li>
  <li>DCS: <strong>Division of Continuing Studies</strong>, also available part-time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Selection process</h3>
<p>Since an application to ROTP is also an application to the Canadian Military College System, all candidates are assessed against an <a>aptitude test</a>, a <a>medical examination</a>, and an <a>interview</a>. </p>
<p>Military Potential is an assessment of Aptitudes, <a>Personality</a> Traits, and the choice of <a>occupation</a>. Academic Performance is rated based on a student's transcript.  Unlike many universities, since a complete transcript is submitted to the selection board, grade 9-11 marks are heavily weighted in a student's application with consideration given to grade 12 (or the final year's) marks. Officer Cadets are obliged to maintain satisfactory academic and military performance throughout the programme.</p>
<h2>Continuing studies</h2>
<p>RMC started a <a>graduate studies</a> programme in 1965. The Division of Continuing Studies was established in 1997.</p>
<p>The mandate of the RMC Division of <a>Continuing Studies</a> is to make university education available to all members of the <a>Canadian Forces</a>, spouses and DND civilian employees. <a>Canadian Forces</a> and other professional training is recognized for credit towards undergraduate or advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Unique degree programs, specially tailored for CF members, include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bachelor of Military Arts &amp; <a>Sciences</a>,</li>
  <li>Master of Business Administration,</li>
  <li>Master of Defence <a>Management</a> and <a>Policy</a>, and</li>
  <li>Master of Arts and PhD in <a>War Studies</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Diploma in Military Arts and Sciences (DMASc) provides Non-Commissioned Members (NCMs) of the <a>Canadian Forces</a> an online program made possible by a partnership between OntarioLearn, the RMC, and the Canadian Defence Academy. Under RMC and Community College articulation agreements, all graduates of this diploma program who apply to the RMC will be admitted into the Bachelor of Military Arts and Sciences degree program with advanced standing.</p>
<h2>Military training</h2>
<p>As an RMC cadet, military training begins with a three week military introduction held at RMC in the summer prior to first year. Phase I of training continues the following summer with the Basic Military Officer Qualification (BMOQ) at the <a>Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School</a> Saint-Jean.   The cadets will complete between 8 and 11 weeks of training in that one summer if they are credited their 4 weeks of recruit camp. After the completion of BMOQ, those cadets who are not yet bilingual are usually enrolled in a seven-week period of Second Language Training (SLT) at Canadian Forces <a>Language School</a> Detachment Saint-Jean. The remaining summers are spent completing Phase II, which are environmental training courses (depending on whether the cadet is <a>Army</a>, <a>Canadian Forces Maritime Command</a> or <a>Canadian Forces Air Command</a>).</p>
<p><a>On the job training</a> courses are also available to a number of cadets during the summer periods.  During Phases III and IV, students take trade specific training courses.</p>
<p>For the most part, military training occurs at locations other than RMC while the college itself focuses on military education.</p>
<h2>First Year Orientation Period</h2>
<p>First Year Orientation Period, (FYOP) is the most demanding experience for many cadets. FYOP takes place during the first month of the academic year following recruit camp. Recruit camp is a 2 week period of military training prior to entering the college done by all ROTP cadets. FYOP can be compared to <a>Frosh week</a> at civilian universities. FYOP begins with the Arch parade where the entire First Year class is marched onto College grounds by their FYOP staff consisting of Third and Fourth Years.</p>
<p>During the course of FYOP, First Year cadets are required to keep an exceptionally high standard of dress and deportment. They are required to march at all times. Physical Training is conducted, with long runs up neighbouring <a>Fort Henry, Ontario</a> hill a frequent occurrence. Inspections of room standards and dress are conducted daily. For the duration of FYOP, First Years are not permitted to leave RMC or receive visitors. Mail and phone calls are allowed but are limited.</p>
<p>The culmination of the FYOP is the <a>obstacle course</a>.  The obstacle course lasts over 2 hours and consists of thirteen obstacles built by each squadron located around the college grounds. Obstacles such as a 12-foot wall and <a>rope bridge</a> are designed to test teamwork and <a>physical fitness</a> of First Years. The First Year flights are judged on the time it takes to complete each obstacle. The completion of the obstacle course signals the end of FYOP. Afterwards, First Years are given a <a>parade</a> where they are officially welcomed into RMC and join the Cadet Wing. Cadets are then allowed to see their friends and relatives after 7 weeks, and allowed the freedom to leave college grounds under the condition that they wear their College <a>uniform</a>.</p>
<p>Second year cadets, in RMC's mentorship program, are paired with first year cadets to <a>mentor</a>, guide, and influence them.</p>
<p>Many of the aspects of the FYOP, including the obstacle course and mentorship program, were developed by the post-war Chesley committee, led by Brigadier Leonard McEwan Chelsey, O.B.E., E.D. The committee made recommendations about the education and training of officer candidates for the postwar active force. In addition, the committee made recommendations about the provision of French speaking officers and arrangements for promotion from the ranks.</p>
<h2>Law</h2>
<p>The <a>Military Law</a> Centre on the grounds of RMC, staffed with 12 military <a>lawyer</a>s, oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters ranging from the Forces' own <a>code of conduct</a> to the <a>laws of war</a>. It trains military lawyers and advises Ottawa on matters of <a>policy</a> and <a>doctrine</a>. The centre integrates <a>legal education</a> into the regular training that Forces members undergo and establishes its growing importance within the military hierarchy. Selected RMC Canada cadets participate in Law Of Armed Conflict international Competitions each fall with cadets from <a>USAFA</a>, <a>USMA</a>, <a>USNA</a>, and <a>USCGA</a>. Each year, RMC cadets are selected to participate in a competition on the <a>Law of Armed Conflict</a> at the International Institute of <a>Humanitarian Law</a> in <a>Sanremo, Italy</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>

<p></p>
<p>One of the four Components of the Royal Military College of Canada, the mission of the Athletic component is to provide opportunities for all officer-cadets to participate in physical activities and sports that are mentally demanding in order to develop their overall physical capabilities, self-confidence and leadership. The Physical education mission is &#x201c;to establish a strong foundation of skills and knowledge in physical fitness, sports, and military-related activities through a progressive and diverse physical education program for RMC Officer Cadets&#x201d; The Vision is &#x201c;foster a passion for active living and leadership in physical activity.&#x201d; To enhance their <a>physical fitness</a> and develop military and athletic skills necessary to lead their troops, Cadets must take physical education classes and play intramural sports every year - for a minimum of four hours per week. The first year program focusses on personal <a>physical fitness</a>: theory on exercise <a>physiology</a>, <a>nutrition</a>, <a>training</a> principles and <a>injury prevention</a>. The cadets complete the Basic Military <a>Swim</a> Standard test. The second year program focussed on collective sports: <a>soccer</a>, <a>broomball</a>, spinning, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>squash</a>, <a>badminton</a>, flag-<a>football</a>, <a>handball</a>, <a>water polo</a> and <a>softball</a>. Cadets acquire basic skills to organize a sport tournament. The third year program focusses on military skills: <a>unarmed combat</a>, different <a>obstacle course</a>s, waterborne training and military <a>rappelling</a>. The fourth year program focussed on individual sports: <a>canoeing</a>, <a>rock climbing</a>, <a>weight training</a>, <a>swimming</a> and <a>life guard</a>ing, advanced <a>unarmed combat</a>, pressure points control tactics and spinning leadership. This series, conceived in 1923, is the longest running annual international sporting event in the world.</p>

Miniature medals and other accoutrements are also worn.</a> RMC is located on Point Frederick (Kingston), a small peninsula at the point where the <a>St. Lawrence River</a> leaves <a>Lake Ontario</a> and where the <a>Rideau Canal</a> system starts.</p>
<p>The location has been an active military base since 1789 and the <a>Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard</a>, located on the site, was an important <a>dockyard</a> during the <a>War of 1812</a>.</p>
<p>Point Frederick includes two sites with <a>National Historic Site</a> designations: the Royal Navy Dockyard and the Point Frederick Buildings</p>
<p>RMC, the first officer training college in Canada, opened in 1876 with 18 cadets receiving military and academic instruction. It was granted university status in 1959.</p>
<p>The <a>Stone Frigate</a>, a large stone building completed in 1820 by Sir <a>Robert Barrie</a>, was designed to hold gear and <a>rigging</a> from British <a>warship</a>s dismantled in compliance with the <a>Rush-Bagot Agreement</a>. It served as a <a>barracks</a> briefly in 1837-38, and was refitted as a <a>dormitory</a> and classrooms to house RMC by 1876. During the <a>Great Depression in Canada</a> of the 1930s, an unemployment relief camp on Barriefield lower common was set up under the command of the RMC Commandant. Public works projects at the Royal Military College in Kingston relied on the labour of the 'Royal Twenty Centers' supplied by the under the Unemployment Relief Commission.  The public works projects included rebuilding the dry stone wall and moat of Fort Frederick; the physics building extension,  the connection from the Fort Frederick Dormitory to the new Yeo mess building, the new wing of the hospital, a new garage, road work, levelling the grounds at RMC for new football fields and a new running track.</p>

<p>Having three national historical designations, environmental assessments (which also involve <a>archaeological</a> studies) are required before construction activities are implemented on the college grounds. While planning to build a new dormitory at RMC, a required environmental assessment revealed the remains of a naval dockyard. This dockyard was significant in the building of ships by the British during the <a>War of 1812</a>. Because of the site's significance, a full archaeological dig had to be implemented before construction of the new dormitory could begin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A plaque describes the Royal Military College of Canada &quot;Following the withdrawal of British forces from Canada in 1870-71, the federal government recognized the need for an officer training college in Canada. In 1874, during the administration of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, enabling legislation was passed. Located on Point Frederick, the site of the former Royal Naval Dockyard, th new college opened on June 1, 1876, with 18 cadets under Lt.-Col. Edward O. Hewett, R.E. Named the Royal Military College of Canada in 1878, it offered academic and military training courses designed to prepare cadets for both military and civil careers. The college was reorganized in 1948 as a tri-service institution and, in 1959, it became the first military college in the British Commonwealth to achieve degree-granting status.&quot; </p>
<p>The Royal Military College of Canada &quot;was the first military college to be established in a colonial dependency and it had a double function, the preparation of cadets for civilian careers as well as for military commissions.&quot; Richard A Preston, <em>Canada's RMC</em>. The Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard was a Royal Navy yard from 1788 to 1853 at the site of the current Royal Military College of Canada.</p>

<h2>The Royal Military College in fiction and popular culture</h2>
<p>The Royal Military College's central place in Canadian military circles has made it the setting for novels, plays, films and other cultural works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In <a>Jetstream</a>, a 2007 television series airing on Discovery Canada about pilots training to fly the CF-18 Hornet in the Canadian Forces, seven of the eight pilots are graduates of the RMC.</li>
  <li>Timothy Findley&#x2019;s fictional character Robert Ross in his World War I novel &#x2018;the Wars&#x2019; (Penguin Canada 2005) studied military law and trajectory mathematics at the Royal Military College of Canada. His novel won the Governor General's Award for fiction and was adapted into a play. In 1985, Timothy Findlay was appointed an Officer of the <a>Order of Canada</a>.</li>
  <li>1982 <a>John-James Ford</a>'s protagonist in his coming-of-age novel <em>Bonk on the Head</em> studied at the Royal Military College of Canada. The novel won the 2006 <a>Ottawa Book Award</a> in the English fiction category.</li>
  <li><a>Oscar Telgmann</a> and George Cameron's &quot;<a>Leo the Royal Cadet</a>&quot; is an <a>opera</a> written in 1889 in which Leo leaves his sweetheart Nellie to serve in the <a>Anglo-Zulu War</a>. Songs about cadet life include 'The Bulldogs', and 'The Royal Cadet' </li>
  <li>&quot;Till we meet again&quot;, is a <a>musical</a> set in <a>Montreal, Quebec</a> during World War II. Each act features an interview with an ex Royal Military College of Canada cadet who is a Canadian army officer: after <a>Dunkirk</a>, after <a>Dieppe</a> and after <a>Juno Beach</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Sara Jeanette Duncan</a>'s &quot;Cousin Cinderella: A Canadian Girl in London&quot; by Macmillan in New York and Methuen in London (1908) features Graham, a Royal Military College of Canada graduate, and his sister Mary Trent. Graham and Mary's father, Senator Trent has earned a fortune in the family lumber business. After serving in South Africa and entering the family lumber business Graham Trent travels with his sister Mary from Minnebiac, a fictional small town in Ontario to England. There, Graham Trent becomes engaged to Barbara Pavisay, a member of a proud old English family whose line extends back to the Tudors. When Barbara Pavisay breaks off the engagement to Graham, his sister Mary becomes engaged to Barbara's brother Lord Pavisay. It is assumed that Graham Trent will return to Canada, continue in the family business and be elected to Parliament. Sara Jeanette Duncan's &quot;A Voyage of Consolation&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Cousin Cinderella: A Canadian Girl in London.&quot;</li>
  <li>Dr. David Clark's Canadian Army Trilogy, The Ridge (1994), Lamone (2001) and Lucifer's Gate 2002 outlines the stories of two generations of the Warwick family and the Canadian Army in <a>World War I</a>. In Lucifer's Gate, Captain James Niles, a Royal Military College graduate, is posted temporarily to a recruit training battalion. He is a professional officer, all spit and polish, everything by the King's Regulations. After ordering the crowd to disperse, Niles accepts thanks from German proprietors of a tailor shop, Hans and Analise Holzhauer and falls for their daughter, Rosamund. The lovely Rosamund is unfortunately, an unsuitable match since they are worlds apart in social position. Niles, who is practically engaged to the Colonel's daughter Roselyn, comes to realize while serving under General <a>Arthur Currie</a> in France, that Roselyn never has a serious thought, caring only about <a>tennis</a> and garden parties.</li>
