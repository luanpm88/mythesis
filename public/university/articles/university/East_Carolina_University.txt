<p>The <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> founded ECU on March 8, 1907 as a <a>teacher training school</a> and selected Greenville as its seat on July 2, 1908 with the first classes beginning in 1909. While East Carolina has historical strengths in <a>education</a>, <a>nursing</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>music</a>, <a>theater</a>, and <a>medicine</a>, it offers over 100 <a>Bachelor degree</a> areas of study including <a>mathematics</a>, <a>hospitality management</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>construction management</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>exercise physiology</a>, <a>political science</a>, <a>social work</a>,and <a>environmental health</a>.</p>
<p>East Carolina's name changed from East Carolina Teachers Training School (ECTTS) in 1907 to East Carolina Teachers College (ECTC), then East Carolina College (ECC), and finally, in 1967, to East Carolina University (ECU).  The Small Business Institute, through the <a>College of Business</a>, offers assistance and advice to small business owners.  The university's academic facilities are located on four properties: <a>Main</a>, <a>Health Sciences</a>, <a>West Research facility</a>, and the <a>Field Station for Coastal Studies</a> in <a>New Holland</a>, <a>North Carolina</a>.  All of the non-health sciences majors are located on the main campus.  The <a>College of Nursing</a>, <a>College of Allied Health Sciences</a>, The Brody School of Medicine and <a>School of Dental Medicine</a> are located on the health science campus.  There are nine <a>social sororities</a> ,16 <a>social fraternities</a>, four historically black sororities, five historically black fraternities, one Native American fraternity, and one Native American sorority. The chairman of its original Board of Trustees, <a>Thomas Jordan Jarvis</a>, a former Governor of North Carolina now known as the &quot;Father of ECU&quot;, participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on July 2, 1908 in Greenville, North Carolina and ECTTS opened its doors on October 5, 1909. Although its purpose was to train &quot;young white men and women&quot;, there were no male graduates until 1932. In 1920, ECTTS became a four&#x2013;year institution and renamed <strong>East Carolina Teachers College</strong> (ECTC); its first bachelor's degrees were awarded the following year in education. A change of name to <strong>East Carolina College</strong> in 1951 reflected this expanded mission.</p>
