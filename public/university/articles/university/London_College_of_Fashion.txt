<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was originally founded by the former <a>London County Council</a> in 1906 as the <strong>Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls School</strong> and the <strong>Bartlett St and Clapham Trade School</strong>, which were opened to train young girls in the art of <a>dressmaking</a>, <a>millinery</a>, <a>embroidery</a> and <a>hairdressing</a>. The London County Council was later abolished and replaced with the <a>Inner London Education Authority</a> until 1986. The two institutions later amalgamated to form one college for the garment trades: London College of Fashion. <strong>Cordwainers College</strong> is an integral school of the London College of Fashion. The former head of college, Sandra Holtby, was awarded the <a>OBE</a> in the 2006 New Year's Honours. The current head of college is Dr Frances Corner.</p>
