Its campus is in the <a>Near West Side</a>, community area, near the <a>Loop</a>. It is the second member of the <a>University of Illinois system</a> and is the largest university in the <a>Chicago area</a>, with approximately 26,000 students enrolled in 15 colleges. UIC operates the nation's largest medical school, with research expenditures exceeding $340 million and consistently in the top 50 US institutions for research expenditures.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago has ranked (most recently in 2003) within the 100 best universities in the world out of 500 institutions compared in the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>. UIC plays a leadership role in Illinois healthcare, operating the state&#x2019;s major public medical center and serves as the principal educator for Illinois&#x2019; physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>UIC competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> <a>Horizon League</a> as the <a>UIC Flames</a> in sports. The <a>UIC Pavilion</a> is home to all <a>UIC Flames</a> basketball games. It also serves as a venue for concerts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago traces its origins to several private health colleges founded during the late nineteenth century, including the Chicago College of Pharmacy, which opened in 1859, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (1882), and the Columbian College of Dentistry (1891).</p>
<p>The <a>University of Illinois</a> was chartered in 1867 in <a>Champaign-Urbana</a>, as the state's land-grant university.  In exchange for agreeing to the Champaign-Urbana location, Chicago-area legislators were promised that a &quot;polytechnical&quot; branch would open in Chicago. The Chicago-based health colleges affiliated with the University in 1896&ndash;97, becoming fully incorporated into the University of Illinois in 1913, as the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. Medical education and research dramatically expanded in the succeeding decades, leading to the development of several other health science colleges, which were brought together as the Chicago Professional Colleges of the University of Illinois.  In 1935, the first act of newly-elected state representative <a>Richard J. Daley</a> was to introduce a resolution calling for the establishment of a Chicago campus of the University of Illinois.</p>

<h3>Expansion after World War II</h3>
<p>In 1945, as the war ended, Daley (then a state senator) introduced four bills calling for a university in Chicago. Known as 'Harvard on the Rocks' and housed on <a>Navy Pier</a>, the campus accommodated primarily student veterans on the <a>G.I. Bill</a>. The campus was not a junior college, but rather had a curriculum based on Urbana's courses, and students who successfully completed the first two years' requirements could go on to Urbana and finish their degree.</p>
<p>Classes at the <a>Navy Pier</a> Campus began in October 1946, and approximately 4,000 students enrolled each semester.  As Chicago had no comprehensive public university at that time, most students were first generation college students from working families, who commuted from home. Demand for a public university education in Chicago remained high, even after the first wave of veterans passed, so the University made plans to create a permanent degree-granting campus in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>In 1951, Daley succeeded in getting the state senate to pass a bill calling for a Chicago campus.  Daley became mayor of Chicago in 1955 and pressed the University of Illinois to accept a Chicago campus., in 1961, Mayor Daley offered the Harrison and <a>Halsted</a> Streets site for the new campus.  In that same year, what would later become the health science colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center (UIMC).</p>
<p>The new Chicago campus was named the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC) and opened in February 1965. (The Circle part of the name referred to the nearby <a>Circle Interchange</a>.)  UICC was designed by <a>Walter Netsch</a> of <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>, a Chicago-based architectural firm responsible for most of today's tallest skyscrapers. Unlike the Navy Pier campus, Circle was a degree-granting institution. Many of the newly-recruited faculty came because it was connected to a strong research university and they pushed for rapid development into a research-oriented school emphasizing graduate instruction. Within five years of the campus' opening, virtually every department offered graduate degrees.</p>
<h3>Consolidation</h3>
<p>In 1979, University of Illinois system president <a>Stanley Ikenberry</a> announced a plan to consolidate the two campuses to form the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The merger took three years of work by Ikenberry; but, in September 1982 it was completed.  The merger strengthened the University's potential for scholarly excellence:  In 1987, the post-merger UIC advanced to Carnegie Research 1 institution status.</p>
<p>In 2000, UIC began developing the South Campus.  The expansion of UIC south of Roosevelt Road increased on-campus living space and research facilities.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>[[Image:UICUniversityHall.jpg|thumb|[[University Hall (UIC)|University Hall]], located on UIC's East Campus]] One in ten Chicagoans with a college degree is a UIC alumnus.  Approximately one in six Illinois doctors is a graduate of the UIC College of Medicine (the nation&#x2019;s largest medical school).  One in three Illinois pharmacists is a graduate of the College of Pharmacy.  More than one third of the state&#x2019;s dentists are graduates of UIC&#x2019;s College of Dentistry.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago offers 74 <a>bachelor degrees</a>, 77 <a>master degrees</a>, and 60 <a>doctoral degrees</a> through its 14 colleges, in addition to the university's specialized <a>Honors College</a> (for undergraduates) and the omnibus Graduate College (for graduate students):</p>

<p>The university is run by the chancellor who is supported by seven vice chancellors, one CEO for administrative functions, and fifteen college deans.  There is a <a>library</a> dean and three regional deans for colleges of medicine.</p>
<h3>Honors College</h3>
<p>UIC's Honors College, started in 1958, was located on the <a>Navy Pier</a> Campus. It was part of the <a>University of Illinois system</a>'s James Scholars Honors Program created at the <a>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>. </p>
<p>In 1962, with the expansion of the Chicago Undergraduate Division, the honors program was extended and consolidated with the <a>University of Illinois College of Medicine</a>. It was also renamed the &quot;Honors College&quot;.</p>
<p>Students admitted to the Honors College must complete an additional application for specific admittance to the college, in addition to the degree-granting college they are already a member of. In order to be admitted and remain into the Honor's College, a student must provide evidence of scholastic merit, maintain a GPA of 3.4 or above, a participate in an Honor's College activity each semester, separate from their regular classes. </p>
<p>The Honors College offices and student lounge are located on campus at Burnham Hall. Additionally, students admitted to the Honors College are eligible to live on designated floors of UIC's residence halls. They have their own study hall, computer lab and a personal faculty advisor with a specialization in the field that a student is majoring in.</p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p><a>thumb|UIC's East Campus in October</a> The student body at UIC consists of more than 27,000 total students, of which nearly 17,000 are undergraduate students. Demographic statistics for undergraduates as of 2009 were:  While not tracked in the sources above, informal surveys suggest that between 5% and 10% of the UIC student population identifies themselves as being of middle eastern descent.</p>
<p>The chancellor operates six diversity-related committees on <a>Asian Americans</a>,  <a>Blacks</a>, <a>Latinos</a>, <a>LGBT</a> issues, Persons with <a>disabilities</a>, and <a>Women</a>.  UIC has been publicly recognized as a diverse and welcoming community. <a>US News &amp; World Report</a> repeatedly ranks UIC in the top 10 most diverse universities in the nation.  In 2006, UIC was ranked by <a>Advocate</a> College Guide as one of the nation's top 100 LGBT friendly campuses.</p>
<h3>Rankings and statistics</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>UIC is one of 96 American universities receiving the highest research classification (&quot;RU/VH&quot;) by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a>.  Under the prior <a>Carnegie classification system</a>, UIC was one of 88 &quot;Research I&quot; universities. In 2005, <a>National Science Foundation</a> statistics on research funding ranked UIC 48th out of more than 650 universities receiving federal research money.  UIC's level of research funding surpassed one <a>Big Ten</a> university and the <a>University of Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>2007 rankings from the Institute of Higher Education in Shanghai placed UIC in 59th&ndash;76th place (tied) among universities in North America and in 102nd&#x2013;150th place (tied) worldwide.  </p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Jane Addams' Hull-House Museum</a> UIC is composed of three campuses supporting more than 25,000 students and 2,300 faculty members and staff.   These campuses cover  in the <a>Little Italy</a> and the <a>University Village</a> section of <a>Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The East Campus was designed in the <a>brutalist</a> style by <a>Walter Netsch</a>.  The  plan included second-story walkways that connected all of the buildings.  These were taken down in phases during the early 1990s as part of a plan to &quot;open up&quot; the campus.  Considerable effort has been expended to modify the original Netsch campus plan to create the feel of a traditional college campus.  The area in front of the main administration building, University Hall, has been the site of several renovations in the last decade.  The <a>UIC Pavilion</a> was added in about 1982.  </p>
<p>The East Campus is located on the <a>Near West Side</a>, just south of <a>Greektown</a> and a 15-minute walk from <a>downtown Chicago</a>.  The juxtaposition of campus and commercial density was a direct result of large-scale urban renewal led by Mayor <a>Richard J. Daley</a>. Nearly 6,000 students live within one-and-a-half miles of campus. 3,800 students, including over half of all freshmen, live in UIC's 10 residence halls. There are also thousands of apartments within walking distance to classes.</p>
<p>On the East Campus, Commons West and Commons South are traditional halls with double rooms opening into a common hallway; each floor shares a common bathroom. Courtyard and Commons North are cluster-style buildings with rooms grouped to share a small private bathroom. These four buildings are connected to the Student Center East which houses a cafeteria, the campus bookstore, a convenience store, bowling/billiards, a barber shop, and the Inner Circle (an assortment of fast food restaurants).</p>
<p>West Campus housing is composed of the Single Student Residence (apartments for graduate students), Polk Street Residence (cluster style rooms), and Student Residence Hall (a traditional dormitory).</p>
<p>South Campus is home to Marie Robinson Hall and Thomas Beckham Hall, both apartment style buildings. In the fall of 2007, James Stukel Towers opened containing suite style rooms with a bathroom and living room.</p>
<p>In keeping with UIC culture,  students often referred to residence halls by abbreviations instead of their full names (e.g. &quot;TBH&quot; instead of &quot;Thomas Beckham Hall&quot;).</p>
<h3>Student recreation facility</h3>
<p><a>thumb|UIC Student Recreation Facility Entrance</a> <a>thumb|UIC Student Recreation Facility Atrium</a></p>
<p>The UIC <a>Student Recreation Facility</a> (SRF) is a recreational complex for UIC students.  Opened in spring 2006, the SRF features a three-story climbing wall; multipurpose courts for games such as basketball, indoor soccer, tennis and many others; and a pool with adjoining lazy river. A few NBA players practiced and worked out at the facility in the summer of 2007 including Andre Iguodala, Antoine Walker, and Eddy Curry.</p>
<p>Other amenities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>. exercise room with equipment</li>
  <li>1/8 mile, 3-lane jogging track</li>
  <li>Three-lane lap and leisure pool including 50-person jacuzzi and a lazy river</li>
  <li>Racquetball and convertible squash courts</li>
  <li>Four court wood floor gymnasium</li>
  <li>. Multi Activity Court</li>
  <li>Group fitness suites, including Spin Suite, Mind/Body Suite, Large Multipurpose Suite and the MAC Suite</li>
  <li>Human performance lab</li>
  <li>. rock climbing wall</li>
  <li>Outdoor adventures office</li>
  <li>Juice and coffee bar</li>
  <li>Active and passive lounge areas</li>
  <li>Daily and annual use lockers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Medical center</h3>
<p>UIC is a major part of the <a>Illinois Medical District</a> (IMD).  While IMD's billing itself &quot;the nation's largest urban medical district&quot; may be up for debate, the district is a major economic force contributing $3.3 billion to the local economy and supporting 50,000 jobs.</p>
<h3>Campus renovations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Grant Hall (renovated)</a> With the major $550 million South Campus expansion complete, the university is focusing its attention on renovating existing facilities on campus.  The focus on renovations is in part due to a constrained state budget: state funds for new buildings are scarce.  Since renovation is less costly, this approach is being used to update facilities.</p>
<p>These renovations began with Grant Hall, continued with the (adjacent) Lincoln Hall, and are planned to continue with (also adjacent) Douglas Hall. These renovations will be 'green' as the renovated buildings will have geothermal power.  Fifty wells are being dug 500 feet into the ground, which will provide an energy savings of 20&ndash;25%. The buildings are also to be US <a>LEED</a> certified.</p>
<p>The new fascia will be all glass and the buildings will contain facilities for faculty and students. There are plans to expand the renovation project to every lecture hall cluster if the pilot program is successful.</p>
<p>Other campus renovations include the roof of the Behavioral Sciences Building and the terrace of the Education, Performing Arts, and Social Work building.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The university's Office of Sustainability was founded in January 2008.  Current sustainability initiatives include lighting upgrades, building envelope improvements, metering upgrades, and landscape waste composting. The college's Grant Hall was recently renovated to include geothermal heat pumps, which efficiently heat and cool the building. The university has a draft version of a Climate Action Plan.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|UIC baseball plays at Les Miller Field</a> UIC's team name is the Flames, a reference to the <a>Great Chicago Fire</a> which started a few blocks east of campus.  The mascot is Sparky D. Dragon.</p>
<p>UIC has generally focused on basketball , soccer and baseball have also had successes.</p>
<p>In September 2006, the men's soccer team earned its highest ranking in school history when the SoccerTimes.com College Coaches Poll pegged the Flames at #6 in the country.  In November 2006, UIC defeated Western Illinois 3&ndash;0 in the opening round of the NCAA tournament before falling in the second round to Notre Dame 1&ndash;0.  UIC finished the 2006 season as the nation's best defensive squad after allowing a mere eight goals in over 1993 minutes of play during 21 matches for a goals-against average (GAA) of 0.36.  The GAA was tops in the nation in 2006 and it also ranked fifth all-time in NCAA history.  UIC posted 13 shutouts and never allowed more than a single goal in a match.  UIC also allowed just two goals after intermission the entire season.  Along with the GAA mark, UIC posted the nation's best save percentage with a 0.908 rate.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In 2007, UIC soccer's successful season culminated in an Elite-Eight appearance in the NCAA tournament by way of wins over #12 St. Louis, Northwestern, and #8 Creighton.  In a bid for a Final-Four appearance, UIC fell to Massachusetts 2&ndash;1.  At season's end, UIC had a record of 13&ndash;6&ndash;6 and was named a top 10 team by the <a>National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA)</a>.</p>
<p>UIC's baseball team has recorded 30 or more victories in 9 straight seasons, won the last 7 Horizon League Championships, and advanced to an NCAA regional in four of the past six years (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008).  UIC baseball has recorded regional wins against #1 Long Beach State in 2007 and #2 Dallas Baptist University in 2008.</p>

<p>[[Image:Precinct.jpg|thumb|The UIC police station house shown on TV show [[Hill Street Blues#Setting|Hill Street Blues]].]]</p>
<p>Film and television series have used UIC for filming locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 2006 movie <em><a>Stranger than Fiction</a></em> used classrooms and offices.</li>
  <li><em><a>Swimfan</a></em> was shot, partially, at the school's competition swimming pools</li>
  <li>The movie <em><a>Primal Fear</a></em> featured UIC's baseball field, Les Miller Field.</li>
  <li>The main character in <em><a>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></em> attends classes at UIC, and the film is set in Greektown, adjacent to East Campus.  (However, the film was actually shot at Truman College in Chicago.)</li>
  <li>In the horror film <em><a>Candyman</a></em>, the main character is a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The opening credits include an aerial shot of the original <a>Walter Netsch</a>-designed East Campus, before the late 1990s renovations.</li>
  <li>The movie <em><a>Mahogany</a></em> was filmed, in part, on the east campus of UIC.</li>
  <li><a>Maxwell Street</a>, in what is now the South Campus, was a filming location for both <em><a>The Blues Brothers</a></em> and <em><a>Child's Play</a></em>.</li>
  <li>TV shows such as <em><a>Early Edition</a></em> and <em><a>ER</a></em> have used the UIC Medical Center for scenes. Ironically, although <em>ER</em> was set in Chicago and predominantly filmed at the <a>Warner Bros.</a> studios in <a>Burbank, California</a>, the courtyard within the UIC College of Medicine doubled for the University of Michigan in the episode &quot;<a>One for the Road</a>&quot;.</li>
  <li>The <a>UIC police station</a> [at the time, still a station of the <a>Chicago Police</a> rather than the university] was shown in the establishing shots for the award-winning TV show <em><a>Hill Street Blues</a></em>.</li>
