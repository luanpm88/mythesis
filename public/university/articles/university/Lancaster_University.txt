<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Following the <a>Second World War</a> the future of higher education became an important concern of the government as it tried to cope with the demands of an expanding population and the advent of a new technological age. Between 1958 and 1961, this balance was readdressed as 7 new <a>plate glass universities</a> were announced; one of these was the University of Lancaster.</p>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p><a>thumb|University chaplaincy centre.</a> The University was established by <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1964. The Charter stipulated that <a>HRH</a> <a>Princess Alexandra of Kent</a> be the first <a>Chancellor</a>. She was inaugurated in 1964. The ceremony also saw the granting of various honorary degrees to dignitaries including <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Harold Wilson</a>. Princess Alexandra served the University as Chancellor until retiring in 2004: she was the longest serving Chancellor of any British university.</p>
<p>The University accepted its first students in October 1964 and there were initially 13 <a>professor</a>s, 32 additional members of teaching and research staff, 8 library staff and 14 administrators on academic grades. The motto, &quot;patet omnibus veritas&quot;, which means &quot;truth lies open to all&quot;, was adopted by the new university.  The first Science students were admitted in 1965.</p>
<p>The University was temporarily based in the city after its establishment. A lecture theatre and the University's first JCR were based in Centenary Church, a former <a>congregational church</a>,  opposite the old factory premises of <a>Waring &amp; Gillow</a>, which were used to accommodate the new students. Many new students were housed in <a>Morecambe</a>. The Grand Theatre was leased as a main lecture room and 112 and 114 within the St Leonard's area became teaching and recreational rooms. The library occupied the old workshops of Shrigley and Hunt on Castle Hill.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Bailrigg</h3>
<p><a>upright|thumb|Alexandra Square</a></p>
<p>The purpose-built <a>campus</a> occupies <a>Bailrigg</a>, a  site donated by <a>Lancaster City Council</a> in 1963.  The campus buildings are located on a hilltop, the lower slopes of which are landscaped <a>park</a>land which includes the &quot;Carter Lake&quot; <a>duckpond</a> and the university <a>playing field</a>s. The site is located three miles (5&nbsp;km) south of the city centre. The campus buildings are arranged around a central <a>walkway</a> known as &quot;The Spine&quot;.  The walkway runs from north to south and is covered for most of its length. The main <a>architect</a> was Gabriel Epstein of Shepeard and Epstein.  Vehicular and pedestrian traffic is separated: this is achieved by restricting motor vehicles to a peripheral road with a linking underpass running east-west beneath Alexandra Square. The underpass accommodates the Bailrigg <a>bus station</a> and is currently (Autumn 2010) undergoing a major refurbishment. Car parking is arranged in cul-de-sacs running off the peripheral road.</p>
<p><a>upright|thumb|left|Bowland Tower</a> Construction of the Bailrigg campus began in November 1965, with the first building being completed a year later. The first on-campus student residences opened in 1968.  The library was extended in 1997 and in 1998 the <a>Ruskin Library</a> designed by Sir Richard MacCormac was opened. On the west side of the square is University House as well as various banks and shops. To the southeast of the square is the tallest building on campus: the fourteen-story Bowland Tower, which contains accommodation and disguises the boiler room chimney.</p>
<p>One of the most distinctive of the Bailrigg buildings is the free-standing <a>University Chaplaincy Centre</a>. Opened on 2 May 1969, the architects were the <a>Preston</a>-based firm Cassidy &amp; Ashton.  The building has a <a>trefoil</a> plan with a central <a>spire</a> where the three circles meet. The University's logo is based on the spire. A plan existed to have a twin campus with another eight colleges to the east of the <a>M6 motorway</a> at <a>Hazelrigg</a>. this would have been linked to Bailrigg by a flyover. The plan was abandoned during the 1970s and the land sold during a period of financial difficulties.</p>
<h3>Major projects</h3>
<p>New accommodation blocks for <a>Furness</a> and <a>Fylde</a> colleges, on the east side of campus, were completed in September 2006, while the near complete rebuilding of <a>Grizedale College</a> and construction of further accommodation for <a>The County College</a> at the northern edge of campus was completed in Summer 2008.  Phase 5 of the residence plan began with the refurbishment of the <a>County Main</a> building in early 2008.  The aim of Phase 5 is to regenerate older accommodation in the University and will continue into 2009 with the refurbishment of much of <a>Bowland College</a>.  The Lancaster University Masterplan 2007&#x2013;2017 envisions improved access across the University with enhanced greenery and the construction of 27 new buildings, which will be largely for academic use. It will cost an estimated &#x00a3;450 million and construction has already been completed on the Information System Services building as well as social space for <a>Grizedale College</a>. In the academic year 2008&#x2013;2009 work began on a new <a>Management School</a> building, a &#x00a3;21 million sports centre and a new LICA (Lancaster Institute for Contemporary Arts) building.</p>
<h3>Southwest Campus</h3>
<p>The University began expansion onto the lower slopes of Bailrigg with the development of new buildings for <a>Graduate College</a> in 1998. The is now part of &quot;Southwest Campus&quot;. Development continued with the construction of &quot;InfoLab 21&quot; and &quot;Alexandra Park&quot; which now houses <a>Lonsdale College</a>, <a>Cartmel College</a> and the en-suite rooms of <a>Pendle College</a>.</p>
<p>The decision to expand onto what is now known as Southwest Campus was met with some protest for various reasons. Some of the complaints against the expansion were that it would drive up accommodation prices, both on and off campus.  The site was a greenfield site, with residents of nearby <a>Galgate</a> being worried about &quot;the impact of the new buildings&quot;, flooding of the local area due to increased run-off from the site and increased traffic flow on the A6 and other local roads.  The development of InfoLab 21 also met objections with the proposed building being described as a &quot;<a>Dalek</a> factory&quot;.  Another concern related to the limited amount of new social space.  The older accommodation sometimes consisted of approximately 15 students sharing communal bathrooms and kitchens. The communal kitchens were often a source of social interaction, while the new en-suite areas have fewer students per kitchen, and private bathrooms.</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>The Bailrigg campus hosts a range of shops and services. Services on campus include Bailrigg <a>post office</a>, <a>Barclays Bank</a>, <a>NatWest Bank</a>, UNI TRAVEL (a travel agent which sells rail and bus tickets), a health centre, a pharmacy and a dental practice. Shops on campus include a <a>SPAR</a> supermarket, LUSU Shop, LUSU Central (a small supermarket), a <a>charity shop</a>, the proceeds of which go to Cancer Care and St. Johns Hospice, <a>Waterstone's</a> bookshop, a newsagent, and a florist.</p>
<h2>Cultural venues</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Outside the Jack Hylton music rooms.</a></p>
<p>Within the University's Great Hall complex (at the North End of Campus) there are three venues open to student and the public these are; Peter Scott Gallery, Lancaster International Concert Series and the Nuffield Theatre.  In 2009 the University combined these three organisations into one, initially termed 'The Public Arts' with Matt Fenton appointed as Director of the Public Arts .  In 2010 the term Public Arts was dropped and the combined organisation was renamed as Live at LICA. </p>
<p>The <a>Peter Scott</a> Gallery is open to the public free of charge. The Gallery is located on the Bailrigg campus and houses the University's international art collection, which includes Japanese and Chinese art, antiquities, works by twentieth century British artists including works by artists from the <a>St Ives School</a>, <a>Sir</a> <a>Terry Frost</a>, <a>Wilhelmina Barns-Graham</a>, <a>Barbara Hepworth</a> and <a>William Scott</a>. Among other British artists whose work is represented are Norman Adams, <a>Patrick Caulfield</a>, <a>Elizabeth Frink</a>, <a>Kenneth Martin</a> and <a>Winifred Nicholson</a>. Within the last fifteen years works by <a>Andy Goldsworthy</a>, <a>Peter Howson</a> and Albert Irvin have been acquired. The university collection also includes prints by significant European artists such as <a>D&#x00fc;rer</a>, <a>Mir&#x00f3;</a>, <a>Ernst</a> and <a>Vasarely</a>.</p>
<p>Lancaster International Concert Series is the main provider of classical music in north Lancashire and Cumbria.  Concerts are held within the Great Hall.  Between October and March each year the series offers a varied diet of music which includes: orchestral concerts, chamber music, events for young people, jazz, family concerts and world music.  </p>
<p>The Nuffield Theatre, a <a>black-box theatre</a>, is one of the largest and most adaptable professional studio theatres in Europe.  It presents public performances in the fields of theatre, contemporary dance and live art from some of the best-known and respected companies from the UK and abroad.  The focus of the work is new and experimental practice, a focus it shares with many of the teaching and research interest of Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts (LICA).  The Nuffield presents up to 30 visiting professional shows a year, plus public performances by students from Theatre Studies, and the University&#x2019;s student theatre and dance societies and a range of local community organisations. </p>
<p><a>upright|thumb|left|The Ruskin Library</a> The <a>Ruskin Library</a> houses archive material related to the poet, author and artist <a>John Ruskin</a>. It is open to the public, although only a small part of the collection is on public display at once. The building was constructed in 1997 by architect Richard MacCormac. The Whitehouse Collection housed in the Ruskin Library is the largest holding of books, manuscripts, photographs, drawings and watercolours by and related to <a>John Ruskin</a> in the world.</p>
<h2>Clubs and societies</h2>
<p>There are many different clubs and societies operating within the University of Lancaster. Common areas include sports, hobbies, politics and religion. There are several fairs during the freshers period in which various clubs and societies promote themselves.</p>
<p><a>Bailrigg FM</a> is the student radio station and Lancaster University Cinema is the student union's on-campus cinema, based in <a>Bowland College</a> Lecture Theatre.</p>
<h3>Sport</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Roses2006.png|thumb|right|Logo of the 2008 [[Roses Tournament]].]] --&gt;</p>
<p>Every summer term the students take part in the <a>Roses Tournament</a> against the <a>University of York</a>. The venue of the event alternates annually between Lancaster and <a>York</a>. As of 2010, York has won the tournament 23 times to Lancaster's 22, with one tie. Other sporting activities are focused on inter-college competition rather than on national leagues. The colleges compete for the Carter Shield and the George Wyatt Cup. In 2004 the Founder's Trophy was played for the first time between the University's two founding colleges, Bowland and Lonsdale. The University also has a representitve club , Furness Rovers, in division 2 of the <a>North Lancashire and District Football League</a>.</p>
<h3>Religious Groups</h3>
<p>There are also a range of religious based societies within the University. <a>Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre</a> is located at the north end of campus and the mosque and Islamic Prayer Room, also open to non-Muslims, is located near InfoLab21. There are Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Bah&#x00e1;'&#x00ed; and Pagan societies which hold regular events and meetings.</p>
<h3>Lancaster University Students' Union</h3>
<p>Lancaster University Students' Union (&quot;LUSU&quot;) is the representative body of students at the University of Lancaster. Unusually, there is no main Union building - instead the Union is organised through the eight college <a>JCRs</a>, each of which has its own social venues and meeting spaces. The Union is, however, allocated an administration building by the University.  <em>Scan</em> is the Students' Union newspaper.  LUSU owns a <a>nightclub</a> in Lancaster called The Sugarhouse, operates two shops on the campus on LUSU Shop and LUSU Central and also an off campus housing agency LUSU Housing</p>
<h2>School of Health and Medicine</h2>
<p>The Centre for Medical Education was established as the co-ordinating unit for all medical and health-related activity across the University. It has since been developed into the School of Health and Medicine and is home to a collaborative venture with The <a>University of Liverpool</a>, the <a>University of Central Lancashire</a> and the <a>University of Cumbria</a> to establish undergraduate medical education in North Lancashire and Cumbria.</p>
<p>The University admits approximately fifty undergraduate medical students per academic year, on study for a <a>MBChB</a> degree which is accredited by the <a>University of Liverpool</a>, though students receive all of their education in Cumbria and North Lancashire.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<h3>Visitor</h3>
<p>The <a>Visitor</a> of the University of Lancaster is <a>Her Majesty</a> <a>The Queen</a>. The Visitor is the final arbiter of any dispute within the University, except in those areas where legislation has removed this to the law courts or other <a>ombudsmen</a>. Student complaints and appeals were heard by the Visitor until the Higher Education Act 2004 came into force.  All student complaints are now heard by the <a>Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education</a>.</p>
<h3>Council</h3>
<p>The Council is the governing body of the University, consisting of mainly lay members along with representatives of staff and students. It is responsible for the proper management and financial solvency of the University, with major policy decisions and corporate strategy being subject to its approval.</p>
<h3>Senate</h3>
<p>The Senate is the principal academic authority of the University. It oversees academic management and sets strategy and priorities, including the curriculum and maintenance of standards.</p>
<h3>George Fox Six controversy</h3>
<p>The &quot;George Fox Six&quot; were six members of the local community, including University students, who were prosecuted for aggravated <a>trespass</a> during a corporate venturing meeting at the University in September 2004. Speakers at the conference were drawn from one of the largest companies in the North West. The protesters criticised these companies for involvement in the arms trade and the abuse of human rights and the environment. The six protesters entered a lecture theatre in the University's <a>George Fox</a> building and their supporters say this was to hand out leaflets and engage delegates of the conference. The University says their aim was to aggressively disrupt the conference.  On 30 September 2005, the six were found guilty of Aggravated Trespass: specifically of intending to disrupt the conference and were ordered to each pay &#x00a3;300 <a>costs</a> and were given a 2 year <a>conditional discharge</a>.</p>
<h2>In The Media</h2>
<h3>The History Man</h3>
<p>In 1980, the BBC's four part mini-series adaption of <a>Malcolm Bradbury</a>'s novel, <a>The History Man</a>, was filmed at the university, masquerading as the fictional University of Watermouth. It had long been rumoured that the events of the book were based in part on activities at the University of Lancaster, although the University of Sussex has also been cited as a possible basis.</p>
