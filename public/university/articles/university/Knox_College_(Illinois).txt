<p><strong>Knox College</strong> is a four-year <a>coeducation</a>al private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Galesburg, Illinois</a>.  Knox is classified as a more selective institution by <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> and is ranked 75th among <a>liberal arts college</a>s by the 2011 edition of <a>America's Best Colleges in <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em></a>.  It is one of 40 schools featured in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Knox College was founded in 1837 by anti-<a>slavery</a> social reformers, led by <a>George Washington Gale</a>. One founder, the <a>Rev. Samuel Wright</a>, actively supported the <a>Underground Railroad</a>. The original name for the school was <strong>Knox Manual Labor College</strong>, but it has been known by its present name since 1857.</p>
<p>The college's name came about through a compromise among its founders. Though founded by a colony of Presbyterians and Congregationalists, the county in which the college is located was already named <a>Knox County</a>, after <a>Henry Knox</a>, the first <a>United States Secretary of War</a>. Arguments have been made that the college was named for <a>Calvinist</a> leader <a>John Knox</a>, but it is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a (great-)great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that &quot;contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father ... Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX. Certainly most of them were pious enough to want the churchman and fighters enough to want the soldier as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Knox was the site of the <a>fifth debate</a> between <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a>Stephen A. Douglas</a> in 1858. The <a>Old Main</a> building is the only site from the debates that still exists today. Two years after the debates, and during his presidential campaign, Lincoln received the first honorary doctorate ever conferred by Knox College&#x2014;a <a>Doctor of Laws</a> degree, announced at the commencement exercises of 5 July 1860.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>Knox College was ranked 75th among <a>liberal arts college</a>s by the 2011 edition of <a>America's Best Colleges in <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em></a>.  In the August 11, 2010 issue of <em><a>Forbes</a></em> magazine, Knox was ranked among the Top 100 <a>liberal arts</a> colleges listed and over 600 evaluated;  In the 2009 rankings, Knox was 111th of 600 listed.</p>
<p>The <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> consistently cites Knox on its <em>&quot;Best of&quot;</em> lists, most recently in 2010 as one of the Best 371 Schools, and one of the Best Midwestern Colleges.  The <em><a>Kiplinger</a></em> private colleges rankings for 2010 placed Knox 47th on its list of 50 best values in liberal arts, measuring academic quality and affordability.  And in 2010 <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em> named Knox among the Top 50 best liberal arts colleges, calling their list &quot;a guide not just to what colleges can do for you, but what colleges are doing for the country.&quot;  Knox College is also one of 40 schools featured in  the book <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em> by former New York Times Education Editor <a>Loren Pope</a>.  In the 2009-2010 academic year, <a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> noted Knox as one of 9 bachelor-level institutions to produce 2 or more <a>Fulbright</a> Awards for U.S. Scholars.  In 2009, a Knox study of itself found that the college ranks in the top 3% of colleges by based on graduates who go on to earn a <a>Ph.D.</a></p>
<h3>Academic program</h3>
<p>Knox employs a 3-3 academic calendar rather than a traditional semester-based approach. In each of the three 10-week terms, students take only three courses. Faculty members teach only two courses each term, giving them more time for one-on-one mentoring.</p>
<p>No matter what course of study students decide to pursue, education at Knox contains common elements, including an educational plan that students design.</p>
<p>Knox College introduced the school's honor code in 1951. All students are held responsible for the integrity of their own work, and students are required to abide by the code. Because of this policy, tests are not proctored, and in many cases students may take their exams in any open, public place within the same building. Any cases of students caught disobeying the system are evaluated by their peers through the Honor Board, a <a>committee</a> consisting of three seniors, three juniors, three sophomores, and three faculty members.</p>
<p>With the implementation of Renewed Knox, the 2002 curriculum overhaul, the school expanded its academic offerings to meet the needs of a liberal arts education in the 21st century. In 2003, the <a>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> awarded the school a $1 million grant to create a new major in <a>neuroscience</a>; in 2005, it signed agreements with <a>The George Washington University</a> to create an early admission program into the university's medical school, and with the <a>University of Rochester</a> to create a direct admissions program into the university's <a>Simon School of Business's</a> <a>MBA</a> program; in 2007 the <a>Peace Corps</a> launched a new program at Knox, establishing the Peace Corps Preparatory Program, the first of its kind in the country; Chinese language instruction, Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, and Film Studies were all added; and new abroad studies programs have been created: the Japan Term, and Knox in New York.</p>
<p>Knox is also known for its Green Oaks term, an interdisciplinary program at the  Green Oaks Biological Field Station, during which students and faculty spend an entire term conducting research and creative projects and participating in courses in biology, anthropology-sociology, and English, as well as workshops in outdoor skills, first aid, and photography.</p>
<p>Knox also promotes top-notch undergraduate research, annually awarding students more than $250,000 in grants to support research and creative projects. Among the programs are the Ford Foundation Research Fellows Program, which funds the scientific, scholarly, and creative projects of 20 students each year, and the summer research program at Knox's Lincoln Studies Center. More than 10 percent of Knox students receive support for independent research and study from the Richter Memorial Foundation Program and the Pew Research Fellowships, which offers Knox students support for off-campus research in science and mathematics. In addition, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund supports student research in ecology and environmental studies and the AAAS/Merck Grant funds interdisciplinary scientific research.</p>
<p>Knox has many distinctive academic programs. The Honors Program is a year-long, in-depth independent research program in which one in seven seniors participates. It culminates in a major thesis or creative portfolio that is presented to and defended before an honors committee that includes Knox faculty and a specialist from outside the college.  In 2007, the <a>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> awarded Knox a $228,750 grant to create a new Center for Research and Advanced Studies, which &quot;will coordinate Knox's numerous existing programs that support advanced work in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and creative and performing arts.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost 50 percent of Knox students take advantage of the opportunities for off-campus learning, studying theatre in <a>London</a>, history in Barcelona, <a>French</a> immersion in Besan&#x00e7;on, mathematics in <a>Hungary</a>, social development in <a>Tanzania</a>, language and culture in <a>Japan</a>, political science in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, and a host of other subjects in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States</p>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<p>According to <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>, Knox is considered to be a more selective institution, with a lower rate of transfer-in students. For the school year commencing in 2008, more than 2,800 students applied, 1,800 were admitted and 400 chose to enroll.  Of the class commencing in September 2009, 37 percent of students were in the top tenth of their class, 67 percent in the top quarter.  The ACT composite Mid-50 percent Range was 26-31, the SAT Mid-50 percent Range 1160-1420.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>1,407 students were enrolled at Knox in March 2010. These students come from 45 states and territories and 48 countries. Eighteen percent of students are students of color (7 percent African American, 5 percent Asian American, 5 percent Hispanic, 1 percent Native American), and 7 percent are international students.  Women make up 60 percent of the student body, men 40 percent.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Knox College has 45 academic and residential buildings on its  campus. In 2006, the new E. &amp; L. Andrew Fitness Center was dedicated. The , $2.4-million facility features state-of-the-art equipment, and is significantly larger than the former fitness center, Memorial Gymnasium.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the Knox campus is <a>Old Main</a>. Old Main is &quot;the oldest building on its campus, and is the best preserved site of one of the 1858 senatorial debates between <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a>Stephen Douglas</a>.&quot;  A <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and part of the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Seymour Library in March|300px</a> Built in 1928, the Seymour Library is was ranked 3rd &quot;Best Library&quot; in the nation by the <a>Princeton Review</a> in 2001. Inside its leaded glass windows and oak paneled reading rooms, the library houses 350,000 books and subscribes to more than 14,000 periodicals.</p>
<p>Famous professor and newspaperman <a>Christopher Morley</a> delivered a three-week-long series of lectures on &quot;Literature as Companionship&quot; at Knox in March and April 1938. In one of these lectures, entitled &quot;Lonely Fun&quot;, he describes the Standish Alcove in the library as modeled after a &quot;gentleman's library,&quot; and praised the opportunities the library offered for solitary leisure. In addition, Knox offers the Kresge Science &amp; Math Library, which houses the scientific and technical collections of the college, and the Center for the Fine Arts Music Library (CFA), which has collections of compact discs, vinyl record albums, printed music scores, and a core reference collection.</p>
<p>Knox's <a>radio station</a> is <a>WVKC</a>. It is located on the fourth floor of George Davis Hall, a former science building that now houses the social science and language departments. Its frequency in Galesburg is 90.7. It is ranked #7 in the nation for &quot;great college radio station&quot; by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> in their 2011 <em>Best 368 Colleges</em> rankings.</p>
<p>Four public <a>computer</a> laboratories are accessible to students, with several more departmental labs available and a dedicated language laboratory. The largest, Founders Laboratory (a converted smoking lounge from many years ago), which is located in Seymour Hall (the <a>student union</a>), is open 24 hours a day throughout the school year. Scanning (including film-scanning and <a>optical character recognition</a>) is available freely to student users, and printing and copy services are available for a fee. In a move to become more environmentally friendly beginning fall of 2005 <a>recycled-content paper</a> was phased in for use in all college printers, addressing the issues of paper waste.</p>
<p>In 2002, a major curriculum revision entitled &quot;Renewed Knox&quot; was launched. With this revision came the creation of six new academic centers: The Center for Research and Advanced Studies, The Center for Global Studies, The Center for Career and Pre-Professional Development, The Center for Community Service, The Center for Teaching and Learning, and The Center for Intercultural Life.</p>
<p>Students established the Knox College Community Garden in 2007 as an independent study project.  It continues to be tended by student volunteers, and produces a variety of annual and perennial vegetables and flowers.</p>
<h2>Costs and financial aid</h2>
<p>Knox is consistently cited for the value and quality of its education, whether by the <em>Princeton Review</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, or Kiplinger.  Knox earned those rankings by offering a nationally recognized liberal arts education, a nationally recognized faculty, a 12:1 student-faculty ratio, and opportunities for independent research and off-campus study.  The school says it is &quot;committed to ensuring cost is not a barrier to that education&quot;. Over the past seven years, the annual increase in the comprehensive fee has ranged from 3.3 to 4.9%.  A variety of merit-based scholarships and need-based financial aid packages are offered. As recently as 2010, the <em>Princeton Review</em> named Knox a &quot;Top 50 Best Value Private College.&quot;</p>
<p>The comprehensive cost (tuition, room, board and fees) of an academic year at Knox was $40,365 in 2010-2011. There are numerous avenues for on-campus employment during the academic year. Knox College offers scholarships to qualified international students who wish to take full advantage of what the American liberal arts mode of education has to offer. International students are also eligible for on-campus jobs.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>Pumphandle is an annual tradition dating back to 1885 during which new members of the community are welcomed to Knox.  On the afternoon before the start of the academic year, all members of the Knox community gather on the south lawn outside Old Main.  The President of the college &#x201c;leads the welcoming line, shaking each person's hand in turn. Everyone shakes the hands of those who have gone before, and the line grows, snaking around the campus.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Flunk Day is an annual spring carnival that allows students, staff, and faculty to mingle and have fun. Classes are canceled for the day as the student body turns its attention to a joke issue of the student newspaper, live music, inflatable bounce rooms, petting zoos and a seniors vs faculty softball game.  The term <em>Old Siwash</em> was popularized by <a>George Helgesen Fitch</a> (Knox Class of 1897) in his book <em>At Good Old Siwash</em>, and was soon adopted as the school's mascot. However, in 1992 a college publication urged the school to reconsider the name given its pejorative and derogatory implications. The <em>Prairie Fire</em> refers to the annual spring burning of the prairie lands at Green Oaks. First conducted in the 1950s by Knox professor Paul Shepard, the burn protects prairie grasses from intrusions of woodland scrub and competition with &quot;exotic&quot; species that have been introduced to Illinois from other regions or countries&#x2014;to the detriment of organisms that have evolved over millions of years in delicate balance with the environment and each other.</p>
<p>Knox is a member of the <a>Midwest Conference</a> of the <a>NCAA</a> at the Division III level. The school offers 21 men's and women's varsity sports, as well as club sports in such things as water polo, fencing, and ultimate frisbee.  Recent athletic highlights would include the 2008 Conference Champion baseball team that participated in the NCAA Division III National Tournament, and Jaran Rutledge, a two-time All-American wrestler who placed in the NCAA Division III National Tournament in 2007(3rd) and 2008(8th).</p>
<p>Knox College is part of the sixth-longest college football rivalry in the United States with <a>Monmouth College</a>.  The Bronze Turkey trophy, awarded annually to the victor of the football game, was created in 1928 and is the brainchild of Knox football alumnus Bill Collins. The Bronze Turkey was named the fifth &quot;most bizarre college football rivalry trophy&quot; by ESPN.</p>
<h2>Recent commencement speakers</h2>
<p>Each year since 2005, Knox has had several well-known commencement speakers, including (in chronological order) <a>Barack Obama</a>, <a>Stephen Colbert</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, <a>Madeline Albright</a>, <a>Patrick J. Fitzgerald</a>, and <a>Christina Tchen</a></p>
