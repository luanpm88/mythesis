<p> <strong>Southern Vermont College</strong> is a private, four-year <a>liberal arts college</a> located on the  former Edward Everett Estate near <a>Bennington, Vermont</a> in the southwestern corner of the state bordering New York and Massachusetts.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Southern Vermont College was founded in 1926 as St. Joseph Business School, an institution offering certificates of proficiency in secretarial accounting, finance,short-hand and typewriting. Eleven students were in the first graduating class. In 1962, it became an accredited junior college, St. Joseph College, awarding associates degrees in business and secretarial science.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, in 1974, the school moved to its current location on the Everett Estate and became Southern Vermont College, a nonsectarian liberal arts college offering a career-directed curriculum. </p>
<p>The 27-room Everett Mansion, now on the National Register of Historic Places, serves as the College's primary administrative and academic building. It hosts the library, theater, Success Center (tutorial assistance), Burgdorff Gallery Cafe, campus shop and eight classrooms, plus administrative offices.</p>
<p>The college currently has five residence halls, but in June the College broke ground on a  residence hall complex, Hunter Hall, that was completed early in 2009 and accommodates 110 residential students. The new residence center, situated on the slopes of Mt. Anthony with a spectacular view of the Green Mountains, is both a living and learning facility, equipped with science and computer labs, study rooms, and a spacious atrium overlooking a newly restored pond. </p>
<p>Other notable buildings include the Dining Hall and Student Center, Field House with Fitness Center, and a 24-hour Computer Lab with wireless workstations for remote Internet access and high-speed data transfer.</p>
<p>Southern Vermont College is a member of the Association of Vermont Independent Colleges (AVIC) and the Vermont Campus Compact, affiliated with the national association of colleges that include community service, hands-on learning and civic engagement as part of their academic requirements. All first-year students at Southern Vermont College take &quot;Quest for Success,&quot; a course that combines classroom instruction with off-campus community projects in such fields as environmental restoration, research on historic objects in the local museum work with a local theater company, and media studies with Community Access Television.</p>
<p>In fall 2008, the College introduced a learn-by-doing program, &quot;Build the Enterprise,&quot; through which students create, implement and manage their own businesses, putting into real-life practice the theoretical business principles acquired in the classroom. The program was capitalized by a $100,000 venture fund.</p>
