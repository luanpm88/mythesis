<p> <a>thumb|300px|Haaren Hall</a> The <strong>John Jay College of Criminal Justice</strong> is a senior college of the <a>City University of New York</a> in <a>Midtown Manhattan</a>, <a>New York City</a> and is the only liberal arts college with a criminal justice focus in the United States.  It has about 14,000 FTE (full-time equivalent) students, including traditional, pre-career undergraduate students and those pursuing master&#x2019;s degrees in several disciplines. John Jay College of Criminal Justice was founded in 1964 and was originally called  the <strong>College of <a>Police Science</a></strong> (COPS). Classes were held at the Police Academy on East 20th Street.  Eventually, the school was expanded to incorporate many <a>liberal arts</a> disciplines and was renamed John Jay College of Criminal Justice. </p>
<p>It moved to its current location in the former  <a>Charles B. J. Snyder</a>-designed <a>De Witt Clinton High School</a> in 1988.  After Clinton moved to the Bronx the building became <a>Haaren High School</a>.  The building is now Haaren Hall on the campus.</p>
<p>It offers criminal justice education and research. It is a training facility for local, state, and federal law enforcement personnel. The college has invited speakers such as <a>Janet Reno</a> and Supreme Court Justice <a>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>. John Jay is one of only a handful of public colleges with two <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners (<a>Mike Wallace</a> and <a>John Matteson</a>) on its faculty.</p>
<p>The school's namesake, <a>John Jay</a>, was the first <a>chief justice</a> of the <a>United States Supreme Court</a> and one of the <a>founding fathers of the United States</a>. Jay was a native of New York City, and a <a>New York State</a> governor. </p>
<p>The school has a <a>Forensic Science</a> program, one of the few schools in the nation which offers the <a>undergraduate</a> degree.</p>
<p>The College is unique from other Criminal Justice programs across the country as a result of its locale. Besides local law enforcement agencies, the New York City area contains a number of federal law enforcement agencies. The geographical location and specialization has afforded the University a pool of experienced instructors from which to hire. The faculty are often former high level law enforcement officers who have years of experience in the field.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|May 2006</a> John Jay College consists of five buildings, with a sixth currently under construction.  The school is located in northwest midtown Manhattan near <a>Columbus Circle</a> and <a>Lincoln Center</a>.</p>
<p>The buildings are: Haaren Hall (also known as the Tenth Avenue building or, simply, the T building), which also contains the <a>Lloyd George Sealy</a> Library, the <a>Gerald W. Lynch</a> Theater, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool; North Hall (N building); newly-constructed Westport Building (W building) where John Jay College rents the first two floors; one floor of the BMW building (6th floor) and one floor of 619 West 54th Street (54th Street Annex). Administration offices are on the top floor of the T building, while the departmental offices are spread across the N building with the exceptions of the Foreign Language and English Departments, which are now located on West 54th Street.</p>
<p>As of December 2008, the College has been undergoing a multi-million dollar expansion project known as &quot;Phase II&quot;, which involves the construction of an additional building on 11th Avenue between West 58th and West 59th Streets in New York City.  It is anticipated that construction will be completed by 2012 at which time the N building will be relinquished to the State of <a>New York</a>.</p>

Student organizations that are given the title &quot;Essential Service&quot; by the <a>City University of New York</a> include <em><a>The John Jay Times</a></em>, the school's theater group known as the &quot;John Jay Players&quot;, and the campus radio station known as WJJC.</p>
