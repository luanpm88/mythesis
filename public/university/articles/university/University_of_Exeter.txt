<p></p>
<p><strong>The University of Exeter</strong> (usually abbreviated as <strong><em><a>Exon.</a></em></strong> for <a>post-nominals</a>) is a public <a>university</a> in <a>South West</a> <a>England</a>. Most of its work is conducted in the city of <a>Exeter</a>, <a>Devon</a>, where it is the principal <a>higher education</a> institution. It belongs to the <a>1994 Group</a>, an association of 19 of the <a>United Kingdom</a>'s smaller research-intensive universities.</p>
<p>The university has three campuses: <a>Streatham</a>; <a>St Luke's</a> (both of which are in <a>Exeter</a>); and <a>Tremough</a> in <a>Cornwall</a>. The Tremough campus is maintained in conjunction with <a>University College Falmouth</a> under the <a>Combined Universities in Cornwall</a> (CUC) initiative.</p>
<p>Its Chancellor is <a>Baroness Benjamin</a>, an actress, author and businesswoman. Its Vice-Chancellor is <a>Professor Steve Smith</a>, who is currently President of <a>Universities UK</a>.</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>The University <a>coat of arms</a> symbolises the university's historical associations with the locality. The triangular gold castle with three towers comes from Exeter's coat of arms and probably represents the <a>Rougemont Castle</a>, as alluded to by the red background. The 15 gold Besants around the edge of the shield are from Cornwall's coat of arms, while the green cross on the white background is from the <a>Plymouth</a> City Council's coat of arms. The theme of learning is symbolised by the book with gold edges and a Latin motto, &quot;lucem sequimur&quot; (&quot;we follow the light&quot;).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After earlier beginnings, university education in Exeter began in 1922 with the conversion of the previous <a>Royal Albert Memorial College</a> into the <strong>University College of the South West of England</strong>, and the College's inclusion on the list of institutions eligible to receive funds from the then <a>University Grants Committee</a>. The College was conceived as a territorial institution, making university education available relatively locally for students from Devon, Cornwall, <a>Dorset</a> and <a>Somerset</a>.  As was customary for new university institutions in southern England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the College prepared students for <a>external degree</a>s of the <a>University of London</a>.  With further growth in the 1920s and 1930s, it was granted increasing autonomy, but full independence was delayed by the <a>Second World War</a>. The university college received its <a>Royal Charter</a> and became the free-standing University of Exeter in December 1955.  In the post-war period, Exeter like other UK universities became much more of a national institution, with students coming from all over the southern United Kingdom; as a research-intensive institution, it now attracts significant numbers of students from overseas.  However, regional activity continued &#x2013; for example, through <a>extramural</a> teaching throughout Devon and Cornwall, and the establishment of an Institute of Cornish Studies in <a>Truro</a>.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Please reference every statement you give in this academic reputation section --&gt; In recent years, Exeter has risen sharply in all the main league tables, except in the QS World University Rankings, as the following tables show.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Exeter's strongest performance is in the Times Good University Guide rankings. </p>
<p>Exeter was the winner of the &quot;Times Higher University of the Year&quot; award in 2007/8, after finishing runner up three times running.  In 2006, it was noted that, &quot;Exeter's excellent record merits special recognition as runner-up this year. Students here are some of the most satisfied in the country, ranking it on the fringes of the top 10. High entry standards and low dropout rates further entrench its standing.&quot; <a>Sunday Times</a>, 10 September 2006.</p>
<h3>National Student Survey</h3>
<p>The 2007 <a>National Student Survey</a> found that some 91% of Exeter students are satisfied with their experience compared to a national average of 81%. This means that Exeter is 7th in the national universities and colleges satisfaction ranking and 4th in the list of traditional universities. This is the third year in a row that Exeter has come within the top ten.</p>
<p>In the 2005 National Student Survey, Exeter was ranked joint 10th nationally for overall satisfaction. The results put Exeter in the top 25 per cent of UK universities for learning resources (such as IT resources) and for course management and organisation.</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>In 2007/08 academic year the University has seen a rise of 23.8% in applications for places &#x2013; one of the highest rises among universities in the country.</p>
<p>In the 2001 UK <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, 98% of subject areas at Exeter were rated 4, 5 or 5* (of national or international standing). In 2008, 17% of the submitted research was rated 4* (&quot;world-leading&quot;) and 89% no lower than 2* (&quot;recognised internationally&quot;).</p>
<p>In the 2006 National Student Survey, Exeter was ranked joint 11th, and the <a>University of Exeter Business School</a> was ranked 1st in the country for Business, Accounting &amp; Finance and Management.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|400px|Washington Singer, Streatham campus</a></p>
<h3>Streatham campus</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|left|250px|Reed Hall, Streatham campus</a> Most students work on the main campus, Streatham, which includes the <a>Northcott Theatre</a>.  Sitting on a hillside one side of which looks down across Exeter city centre, the campus is renowned for its beautiful landscaping and excellent views. <a>The Independent</a> has described the campus environment as &#x2018;sublime&#x2019;.  The campus also has several galleries, including the <a>Bill Douglas Centre</a> for the history of cinema and popular culture. There is also a <a>Sculpture Walk</a>, including pieces by <a>Henry Moore</a>, <a>Barbara Hepworth</a> and a statue to commemorate the events at <a>Tiananmen Square</a>. There is a pub type bar called the Ram and a Bar (previously called the Ewe) within a nightclub called the Lemon Grove (or Lemmy), both run by the Students' Guild. The campus boasts a medical centre, a counselling service, a children&#x2019;s day-care centre, and numerous catering outlets. Many halls of residence and some self-catering accommodation are located on this campus or in the near vicinity. In 2005 Streatham Campus's newest building, the Xfi centre, was completed to provide facilities mainly but not exclusively for postgraduate study into finance and investment.</p>
<h3>St Luke's campus</h3>
<p> The St Luke&#x2019;s campus is home to the largest academic school of the University, the <a>Graduate School of Education (previously known as School of Education &amp; Lifelong Learning)</a>. It shares the campus with the Peninsula Medical School (a joint venture with the <a>University of Plymouth</a>) and the School of Sport and Health Sciences. The campus is just over a mile from the larger Streatham campus and 10 minutes&#x2019; walk from the city centre.</p>
<p>The St Luke&#x2019;s campus also has its own restaurant, cafeteria, bar, bookshop, bank, indoor swimming pool, two gymnasia including an advanced conditioning studio and grass tennis courts for summer use.</p>
<p>The future of St Luke's is currently under review, with a proposal to bring one of the Schools located there to the Streatham Campus to allow further expansion (see <a>below</a>).</p>
<h3>Tremough campus (University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus)</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Main Library, Streatham campus</a>  The <a>University of Exeter's Cornwall campus</a>, <a>Tremough</a> now houses all the university's activity in Cornwall, previously scattered across the county.  It is part of the <a>Combined Universities in Cornwall</a> project, and is shared with <a>University College Falmouth</a>.  University of Exeter departments on the site include the internationally renowned CSM (<a>Camborne School of Mines</a>), whose graduates who are highly sought after by mining and civil engineering industries as well as the (renewable) energy sector. CSM, founded over 100 years before the University of Exeter, merged with Exeter in 1993 and is now part of the School of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences (SEMPS).  Other departments at Tremough include <a>Conservation Biology</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Geography</a> and the <a>Institute of Cornish Studies</a>, and additional departments are being added, such as History and Law, the first year of which started in October 2007.</p>
<h3>Students' Guild</h3>
<p>Students at Exeter are represented by a <a>Guild of Students</a>, which has an active role in campaigning at local and national levels.</p>
<p>Exeter's Guild is home to award winning media: a student radio station <a>Xpression FM</a>, a newspaper <a>Exepos&#x00e9;</a>, a website <a>X-Media Online</a> and television station <a>XTV</a>. There is also a volunteering agency within the Students' Guild called <a>Community Action</a>, which runs its own projects with members of the local community that are run by volunteers and provides further volunteering opportunities through links with external partner organisations. There is a RAG (Raising and Giving) group which exists to raise money for five nominated charities, and collects in town centres around Britain every weekend. RAG events are run by students, under the co-ordination of a full-time member of staff. The main aim of these societies and activities groups is to provide opportunities for student development. The Guild of Students was renamed the Students' Guild in 2005.</p>
<p>There are over 100 affiliated student societies, ranging from the Theatre Company and Creative Writing to the <a>LDYS</a>, <a>Conservative Future</a>, and <a>Socialist Students</a> societies. There are a very large number of sports clubs, and the <a>Athletic Union</a> (AU) is now a separate body from the Students' Guild. This organisation is led by a student-elected President, currently Simon Tyson. The Debating Society which predates establishment of the university, started life in 1893 as The Exeter Debating Society at the <a>Royal Albert Memorial College</a>, and has played host to many notable speakers including <a>Anthony Eden</a>, <a>H H Asquith</a>, <a>Ludovic Kennedy</a>, <a>Michael Foot</a> and <a>Stephen Fry</a>.</p>
<p>Students are represented by a sabbatical team consisting of a President, Vice President Participation and Campuses, Vice President Welfare and Community, Vice President Academic Affairs, and the Athletic Union President. There are also other non sabbatical officers representing areas of the student population and student activities areas.These are elected by students in a series of elections throughout the academic year. <a>thumb|left|250px|The Peter Chalk Centre, Streatham campus, with the Physics tower in the background</a></p>
<h4>Evangelical Christian Union disputes</h4>
<p>Since late 2006, the Exeter Students' Guild has been in dispute with the Evangelical Christian Union (ECU), over the ECU's requirement that members sign a declaration saying they agree to a statement of beliefs, and the requirement that speakers and committee members agree to a <a>doctrinal basis</a>. The ECU's <a>umbrella organisation</a>, the <a>Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship</a>, promote the idea of the doctrinal basis for committee members.</p>
<p>On 24 October 2006, the existing Christian Union was instructed by the Guild to change its name to the Evangelical Christian Union, following a referendum vote by students at Exeter University. The name change was intended to clarify that the society's position was that of <a>Evangelical Christianity</a>, rather than of all forms of Christianity, and was proposed by a member of the Christian Union.</p>
<p>The dispute was covered nationally by news channels including the BBC, with the Students' Guild freezing the accounts of the Christian Union, and refusing them free access to Guild facilities as well as advertising rights.</p>
<p>On 26 February 2007, the Guild issued a statement saying that Ben Martin is now willing to follow the Internal Complaints Procedure. By the summer this was completed, with Mark Shaw QC ruling in the students' guild's favour. .</p>
<p>In 2008/9, after one more failed try by the ECU to change the Students' Guild Constitution in terms of being able to restrict membership to only Christians, the President Robert Moore decided to make a U-turn at the end of the academic year.  He proposed scrapping this idea entirely and opening the doctrine of the society up to those of all faiths.  This idea seemed greatly supported but the committee of 2009 preferred that this decision be reviewed by them.</p>
<h2>New developments</h2>
<p>The University has undergone an investment programme worth more than &#x00a3;235 million  in recent years. &#x00a3;38 million has been invested in new student accommodation, including the new Holland Hall, named after the former vice-chancellor of the same name.  &#x00a3;8m has been invested in sports facilities, including a professional-standard tennis centre. A &#x00a3;1m upgrade has been carried out to the students&#x2019; union building and nightclub and &#x00a3;1.5 m has been spent improving access for people with disabilities.  In October 2002, The <a>Peninsula Medical School</a>, a partnership between the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, admitted its first students of medicine. In 2005, the new <a>Xfi Centre for Finance and Investment</a> opened, the result of a multi-million pound gift from an anonymous donor.  Thanks to a donation of &#x00a3;650,000 from the Ruler of <a>Sharjah</a>, His Highness Dr Sheikh <a>Sultan bin Mohamed Al-Qasimi</a>, an extension has been added to the also recently constructed Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies Building.  In 2006, the Department of Drama completed a major renovation.  The Department of Drama's state-of-the-art &#x00a3;3 million Alexander Building was named after the former University Chancellor Lord Alexander.  A new &#x00a3;28 million <a>Peninsula Dental School</a>, a partnership between the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, will open its doors in October 2007.  The dental school will have places for 62 graduate entry students each year.  The South West of England Regional Development Agency is investing &#x00a3;9.7 m in phase II of the University of Exeter Innovation Centre.  The project is currently under construction and will create a  building for use by new and growing businesses within the development and research sectors at the university's Streatham campus.  Phase I of the Innovation Centre was finished in 2000 and houses high-tech businesses from the software, biomedical sectors to advanced manufacturing and internet firms.</p>
<p>The School of Biosciences is undergoing massive investment to further improve the facilities. The Business School, formerly SoBE - The school of Business and Economics, is set to receive investment in the form of a new building to add to its existing buildings of Streatham Court and XFi. Further to the new building, a new student services centre has been constructed in Streatham Court and its lecture theatre corridor and MBA suite renovated.</p>
<h3>Forum Project</h3>
<p>&#x00a3;48 million has recently been invested into the renovation of the library, great hall and the area between it.   The large glass structure will resemble a large shopping mall style, with a top of the range conference lecture theatre, and many seminar rooms.  It will have trees planted, as well as flowing water to give a modernist, yet natural atmosphere.</p>
<p>The new building will act as the University's main reception, and is intended to help push the University further into the top 10 in the UK.</p>
<h3>Restructuring</h3>
<p>For nearly 40 years Exeter was the only university in the south-west peninsula, and as such it sought to offer the maximum number of academic disciplines.  By 1995 the University had nearly 50 separate departments and centres.  Its <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> performance in 1996 was poor, and this was widely attributed to the absence of large strong units.   As a result, an internal working party recommendation a reorganisation into a smaller number of Schools (18, now reduced further to 11, though the two schools of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry have been added), with the abolition of the traditional <a>Faculties</a> of Arts, Science etc.</p>
<p>Despite this internal reorganization, the University again entered the 2001 RAE with substantially more disciplines than most comparable universities, and consequently with smaller units.   Since 2000, the University has therefore undergone a further process of restructuring in order to focus on areas of strength. In 2004, it closed two departments (chemistry and music) that had been suffering low student demand for a long period, and had failed to achieve a 5-grade in any of the RAEs. Although similar moves elsewhere had attracted little attention, a media storm blew up around this issue at Exeter, perhaps because of the high profile that the Vice-Chancellor, Professor <a>Steve Smith</a>, was taking in UK university politics at the time (for example, he had just been appointed as Chair of the 1994 Group). There was also protest within the institution.  The closures eliminated 130 jobs, and the <a>AUT</a> questioned the University's financial figures. [[Image:Exeter protests over Chemistry closure.png[|right|thumb|Protests over department closures. Photograph taken from <a>http://exepose.ex.ac.uk/</a> Exepos&#x00e9;].]] On Thursday, 25 November 2004, about 2,000 students marched in protest over the decision, making the local television news. Some even attempted to sell the University on <a>eBay</a> in protest.  Sir <a>Harold Kroto</a>, a <a>Nobel laureate</a>, returned his <a>honorary degree</a> from this institution in protest against this move., as did celebrated percussionist Dame <a>Evelyn Glennie</a> . The university faced further protest in 2008 when more than 2,000 people signed a petition against plans to get an outside firm to run its profitable and outstanding-rated campus Family Centre.</p>
<h3>The future of St Luke's</h3>
<p>In 2006, the University commissioned a <a>feasibility study</a> into the future of the St Luke's site, the location of the Schools of Education and Lifelong Learning, the School of Sports and Health Science, and the university's part of the <a>Peninsula Medical School</a>.  The Vice-Chancellor stated that the &quot;problem is one of success, that is if these three Schools achieve their planned expansion ... then we will simply run out of space at St Luke's.&quot;.  The options considered were moving the three schools currently located there onto the Streatham campus, with the sale of the St Luke's site; moving one of the Schools to the Streatham campus, and expanding the other two at St Luke's; and attempting to expand all three at St Luke's.  Although media and student attention focussed on the first of these possibilities, the consultants' advice was that the middle path of moving one School was the most financially sensible, and it is likely that this is what university management had always intended.</p>
