<p>Charles Darwin University was created on 1 January 2004 from the amalgamation of Northern Territory University (NTU) of <a>Darwin</a> and Centralian College of <a>Alice Springs</a>. The University is named after <a>Charles Darwin</a>, the celebrated English naturalist.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Charles Darwin University has evolved over the years through the merging of several higher education institutions.</p>
<h3>Darwin Community College</h3>
<p>Darwin Community College, founded in 1974 and renamed Darwin Institute of Technology in 1984, was a combined <a>College of Advanced Education</a> and a <a>TAFE</a> College. It was situated on what is now the Casuarina Campus, although it used other buildings at various times in Darwin. By the time of the formation of the Northern Territory University, it gave degrees in Arts, Education, Business and Applied Science.</p>
<h3>University College of the Northern Territory</h3>
<p>On several occasions, the <a>Government of the Northern Territory</a> requested the Australian Commonwealth Government to finance a university in the Territory. The response was always that the population was too small. In 1985, it took the unusual step of financing the University College of the Northern Territory itself for a five year period from 1987 to 1991. The college was governed by a Council, chaired by <a>Austin Asche</a> and lead by a Warden, Professor Jim Thomson, from the <a>University of Queensland</a>. An arrangement was made with the University of Queensland that the College would awards degrees from that institution. Staff were recruited in 1986 and housed in the old Darwin Primary School buildings. Just prior to taking the first students in February 1987, the College moved to converted building of the former Darwin Hospital at Myilly Point in Darwin. The former Nurses' Hostel became a student residence, named International House. The College had two Faculties, of Arts and Science. It awarded, through  the University of Queensland link, the first <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> degrees in the Northern Territory.</p>
<h3>Centralian College</h3>
<p>Centralian College was founded in 1993 from the merger of Sadadeen Senior Secondary College and the <a>Alice Springs</a> College of TAFE.</p>
<p>During its life, the college delivered senior secondary, <a>TAFE</a> and <a>Higher Education</a> through its main campus in <a>Alice Springs</a>, and to a lesser extent the whole <a>Northern Territory</a>.</p>
<p>Centralian College is a co-educational senior secondary school, for students from Year 10 to Year 12.</p>
<p>Centralian College shares its campus with the Charles Darwin University campus of Alice Springs. Centralian College uses the university's facilities and students attending Centralian College can participate in VET courses (as early as Year 10) offered by CDU.</p>
<h3>Northern Territory University</h3>
<p>The Northern Territory University (NTU) was founded in January 1989 by merger of the Darwin Institute of Technology, and the University College of the Northern Territory. The merger was controversial, but forced by the so-called <a>Dawkins Revolution</a> under Federal Minister of Education <a>John Dawkins</a>. The new university started life on 1 January 1999. Degrees of the University of Queensland continued to be awarded for a few years.</p>
<p>The first <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> was Professor <a>Malcolm Nairn</a> from <a>Murdoch University</a> in Western Australia. Under his leadership the university prospered and morale was high among both staff and students. However funding declined as student numbers rose. During his term of office the various study centres around the Territory, that previously had been run directly by the NT Government, became part of the University. The Palmerston campus, for a few years previously a TAFE College, also became part of the university. The Palmerston campus is situated on University Avenue as this was the proposed site for a new university in a submission to the Federal Government in 1981.</p>
<p>The second Vice-Chancellor was Professor <a>Roger Holmes</a> from <a>Griffith University</a>. After an initial excellent start to his period of office, he disappointed the university and local community by resigning after serving for only one semester to take up the post of Vice-Chancellor at <a>University of Newcastle</a>.</p>
<p>He was replaced as third Vice-Chancellor by the then Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor <a>Ron McKay</a>. Under his leadership, the financial constraints on the university increased. The environment of having to provide as wide as possible a tertiary education to a small population living in a very large area far from alternative institutions became even more hostile and the university did not prosper. In January 2001, the Katherine Rural College, including  Mataranka Station, became part of the university.</p>
<p>After Ron McKay's resignation due to ill health in 2002, an interim Vice-Chancellor, Professor <a>Ken McKinnon</a>, former Vice-Chancellor of the <a>University of Wollongong</a> was appointed. He took various actions to improve the health of the university, some controversial, such as the proposal to merge with Centralian College with a new name for the university.</p>
<h3>Charles Darwin University</h3>
<p><a>250px|right|thumb|Library, Palmerston campus</a> On 21 August 2003, the <a>Northern Territory Legislative Assembly</a> passed the Charles Darwin University Bill, merging <a>Alice Springs</a>' <a>Centralian College</a> with the Northern Territory University to form Charles Darwin University from 1 January 2004. The inaugural university council meeting was held on 26 November 2003.</p>
