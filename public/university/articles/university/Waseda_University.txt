<p>  , abbreviated as , is one of the most prestigious private universities in Japan. Its main campuses are located in the northern part of <a>Shinjuku</a>, <a>Tokyo</a>. Founded in 1882 as <em>Tokyo Senmon Gakko</em>, the institution was renamed &quot;Waseda University&quot; in 1902. It is known for its liberal climate symbolized by the motto ,. Especially, the School of Political Science and Economics has significant influence on Japanese society. </p>
<p>The alumni include six post-war prime ministers and prominent corporate leaders. Currently, seven of the Fortune Global 2007's CEOs are Waseda graduates. Waseda University is a member of <a>Universitas 21</a>, an international network of 21 universities that have a particular focus on research.</p>
<h2>Institution</h2>
<p>[[Image:OKUMA-SHIGENOBU.jpg|left||thumb|The [[&#x014c;kuma Shigenobu]] statue on the campus. &#x014c;kuma founded the institution that is now Waseda University in 1882.]]</p>
<h3>History and development</h3>
<p>The university was founded by <a>samurai</a> scholar and <a>Meiji</a>-era politician and former prime minister <a>&#x014c;kuma Shigenobu</a> in 1882, and was designated as a full university in 1902. It started as a college with three departments under the old Japanese system of higher education.</p>
<p>In 1882, the university had the department of political science and economics, law, and physical science. Along with these departments, an English language course was established, where the students of all the departments could learn English.</p>
<p>Three years later, the department of physical science was closed because it had too few applicants.  The department of science and engineering was established in 1908.</p>
<p>The department of literature was established in 1890.</p>
<p>The department of education was established in 1903, and the department of commerce, in 1904.</p>
<p>Much of the campus was destroyed in the fire bombings of Tokyo during <a>World War II</a>, but the university was rebuilt and reopened by 1949. It has grown to become a comprehensive university with two senior high schools and school of art and architecture.</p>
<h3>Origin of the name</h3>
<p>Waseda University started its life as  on October 21, 1882. Before the name 'Waseda' was selected, it was known variously as  or  after the location of the founder's villa in Waseda Village and the school's location in Totsuka Village respectively.</p>
<p>It was renamed  on September 2, 1902 upon acquiring University status.</p>
<h3>Academic cap</h3>
<p><a>right||thumb|Waseda's square academic cap.</a> &#x014c;kuma had long desired to create an academic cap so distinctive that someone wearing the cap would immediately be identified as a Waseda student. The chief tailor of <a>Takashimaya</a>, Yashichiro, was called upon to design a cap in three days. Each square cap was stamped on the inside with the student's name, his department, the school seal and the legend, &quot;This certifies that the owner is a student of Waseda&quot;. Thus, the cap served as a form of identification, and effectively a status symbol. The cap, with its gold-braided badge, is registered as a trademark.</p>
<h3>125th Anniversary</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|125 Anniversary.</a> On October 21, 2007, Waseda University celebrated its 125th anniversary. &#x014c;kuma often talked about the &quot;125 years of life&quot; theory: &quot;The lifespan of a human being can be as long as 125 years. He will be able to live out his natural lifespan as long as he takes proper care of his health&quot;, because &quot;physiologists say that every animal has the ability to live five times as long as its growth period. Since a man is said to require about 25 years to become fully mature, it follows that he can live up to 125 years of age.&quot; This theory propounded by &#x014c;kuma was very popular and often referred to in the media of the time.</p>
<p>In commemorative events relating to Waseda University and &#x014c;kuma, the number 125 is accorded special significance, as it marks an important epoch. The tower of &#x014c;kuma Auditorium, completed on the university's 45th anniversary, is 125 <em><a>shaku</a></em>, or about 38&nbsp;m high. In 1963, there were also events to mark the 125th anniversary of &#x014c;kuma's birth.</p>
<p>&#x014c;kuma, who twice served as prime minister of Japan, organized his second cabinet when he was 77 and died when he was 83. He said, &quot;I wish I had understood this '125&nbsp;years of life' theory 30&nbsp;years earlier&quot;. He did, however, lead a regular life, and lived fairly long compared to other Japanese at the time.</p>

<h2>Facilities</h2>
<h3>&#x014c;kuma Auditorium</h3>
<p>[[Image:WASEDA-DAIGAKU.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The [[&#x014c;kuma Memorial Hall]], a contemporary building by architect <a>Sat&#x014d;&#x3000;K&#x014d;ichi</a>.]] Soon after &#x014c;kuma's death on 10 January 1922, the planning of memorials commenced. The first decision was to construct a large auditorium, something &#x014c;kuma had always dreamed of.</p>
<p>The three-story main auditorium seats 1,435, while the secondary auditorium, located underground, can accommodate 382 people. A seven-story high clock tower stands to the left of the auditorium. The height of the tower, at 125 <a>shaku</a>, or about 38 m, represents the theory of &quot;life of 125 years&quot; advocated by &#x014c;kuma. The bells at the top of the tower were transported through the <a>Panama Canal</a> from the MacLean Company in <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>Maryland</a>. It was the first time that four bells, large and small, had been used in Japan.</p>
<p>Oval-shaped transom windows on the roof represent the sun, moon, and nine planets of our solar system, and symbolize the &quot;harmony of the universe&quot; both inside and outside the auditorium. The auditorium opened on October 20, 1927, about five years behind schedule, after the <a>1923 Great Kant&#x014d; earthquake</a>. A Memorial Hall, constructed in 1957, was used as the <a>fencing</a> venue for the <a>1964 Summer Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>In April 1999, the auditorium along with the old library building were officially designated the first and second historical buildings under the newly-passed Tokyo Metropolitan Landscape Regulations, which aim to preserve buildings representative of Tokyo's history and culture.</p>
<p>The auditorium was designated as one of the important cultural assets of Japan by the <a>Ministry of Education</a> in 2007.</p>
<h3>Libraries and museums</h3>
<p><a>right||thumb|Waseda University Library, Reading Hall</a> The <a>Waseda University Library</a>, designed by Tachu Nait&#x014d;, Kenji Imai and Kin'ichi Kiriyama, was completed in 1925. This five-story building, with a total area of 1,195  (about 3,944 square meters), was used initially as the University Library. The reading room was housed in a separate two-story building, with a seating capacity of 500. One of the prominent libraries established at the end of the <a>Taish&#x014d; period</a>, it has been a symbol of Waseda University to this day, along with the Okuma Auditorium and the Theatre Museum.</p>
<p>The Old Library and the administration building were expanded in 1934 and 1955 respectively. The Old Library stopped serving as a main library, after the New Central Library, located where the Abe Stadium used to be, was completed in 1990. It now houses Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library, the University Archives, and Aizu Yaichi Museum. Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library opened in 1994. It is named after former university president Takata Sanae. Historical and cultural materials on Waseda University are exhibited in the University Archives, and the materials related with &#x014c;kuma Shigenobu are exhibited in the &#x014c;kuma Memorial Room at the Archives. Aizu Yaichi Memorial Museum opened in 1998. <a>right||thumb|Waseda University Library, Current Front Hall</a> In the front hall, visitors are greeted by the masterpiece &quot;Meian&quot;, which dates back to 1927. It is painted on the world's largest hand-made washi (Japanese paper), which is 4.45 meters in diameter and weighs about 12 kilograms. It was manufactured by Iwano&#x3000;Heisabur&#x014d;, the founder of the Echizen paper works in Imadachi-cho, Fukui prefecture. The masterpiece was painted free of charge by <a>Yokoyama Taikan</a> and <a>Shimomura Kanzan</a>, two artists who represented the modern Japanese style of painting. President Takata Sanae asked them to paint a picture for the Library.</p>
<p>The library possesses a unique collection which survived the <a>Bombing of Tokyo in World War II</a> unlike many of its counterparts. The collection is an important resource for the study of pre-war Japanese history and literature. </p>
