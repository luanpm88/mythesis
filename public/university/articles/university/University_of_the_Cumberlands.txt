<p><strong>University of the Cumberlands</strong> is a private, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Williamsburg</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>, with an enrollment of approximately 3,200 students.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>University of the Cumberlands, first called <strong>Williamsburg Institute</strong>, was founded on January 7, 1889. At the 1887 annual meeting of the Mount Zion Association, representatives from 18 eastern Kentucky <a>Baptist</a> churches discussed plans to provide <a>higher education</a> in the Kentucky mountains. The college was incorporated by the <a>Kentucky state legislature</a> on April 6, 1888. In 1907 the school bought the three buildings of <strong>Highland College</strong>, and in 1913, Williamsburg Institute's name was changed to <strong>Cumberland College</strong>. In 1959 Cumberland College began offering <a>bachelor's degree</a>s again, having previously awarded the degree until 1913. Cumberland College changed its name to <strong>University of the Cumberlands</strong> on January 7, 2005.</p>
<p>Nine presidents have led the college including William James Johnson; E. E. Wood; John Newton Prestridge; Gorman Jones, acting president; A. R. Evans, acting president; Charles William Elsey; James Lloyd Creech; J. M. Boswell; and James H. Taylor.</p>

The park is the home of <a>Cumberland Falls</a>, sometimes called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South or the Great Falls and is the only venue in the Western Hemisphere where a <a>moonbow</a> or <a>lunar rainbow</a> is regularly visible on a clear night with a full moon. Because of how close the falls are, many students go there to hike in the surrounding area and to see the moonbow.</p>

<h2>Controversy</h2>
<h3>Jason Johnson</h3>
<p>Jason Johnson of <a>Lexington, Kentucky</a> was forced to withdraw from the university on April 8, 2006, after he revealed that he is gay on the social networking site <a>MySpace.com</a>. The  sophomore theatre arts major was told by officials that they don't approve of his &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; and, although he was a dean's list student, his grades were all downgraded to &quot;F&quot;. University president, Dr. <a>James H. Taylor</a> said in a written statement, &quot;At University of the Cumberlands, we hold students to a higher standard than does society in general...University of the Cumberlands isn't for everyone. We tell prospective students about our high standards before they come.&quot; The student handbook, as revised in 2005, states that students can be removed from campus for participating in pre-marital sex or promoting homosexuality &mdash; a policy which Johnson's attorney alleges was added after Johnson decided to go to school at UC.  </p>
<p>The legality of such a policy is doubtful as the university receives funds from the <a>Kentucky state government</a>.  According to the <a>Supreme Court</a> ruling in <em><a>Bob Jones University v. United States</a></em>, any university receiving public monies may not discriminate, so any court challenge will likely center on this. In Judge Crittenden's decision denying public funding to UC's pharmacy school, he declined to decide this question, stating that the proposed spending violated portions of the Kentucky Constitution that guarantee religious freedom and that public money for education should not be spent on any &quot;church, sectarian or denominational school.&quot; </p>
<p>On April 19, 2006, Johnson's attorney and the university reached a settlement allowing Johnson to complete his coursework for the semester and restoring his previous grades.  The university agreed to not report to other universities that Johnson was expelled.  In addition, Johnson waived his right to sue the university, although he may still file a grievance with the <a>Department of Education</a> or the Southern Association for Colleges and Schools.</p>
<h3>Soulforce</h3>
<p>On March 28, 2007, the pro-<a>Gay and Lesbian rights</a> group <a>Soulforce</a> brought its 2007 Equality Ride to Cumberlands' campus. According to the group's website, &quot;through dialogue with administrators, faculty and students, the young activists of the 2007 Equality Ride will make clear the harmful effects of the false notion that homosexuality is a 'sickness and a sin.' To make public their case for equality, the young activists on the Equality Ride will hold vigils, Bible studies, class discussions, community forums, and press conferences.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the university, an offer was extended to the group to be located in the middle level of the Boswell Campus Center, but Soulforce rejected those terms. However, according to Soulforce, an offer from the university was quickly withdrawn because of a miscommunication and the university later refused to agree to terms in writing.</p>
<p>Two University of the Cumberlands students were arrested on a charge of failure to disperse, along with a member of the Soulforce group, for trespassing and failure to disperse when they stopped on the sidewalk of Main Street, which runs through the campus. According to Williamsburg police chief Denny Shelley, police did not try to harass or discourage the group's members but told them they needed to keep moving so they wouldn't block the sidewalk, which would be a safety issue. The AAUP concluded that &quot;The policies of Cumberland College, including the grievance procedure, do not provide for faculty hearings of any kind. College policies and practices preclude any effective faculty role in academic governance and contribute to an atmosphere that stifles the freedom of faculty to question and criticize administrative decisions and actions.&quot; The AAUP noted that current and former faculty members &quot;do not feel free to address topics of college concern in any forum&quot; and &quot;described a climate of fear about what faculty members may say and do, a fear based on what they know or have been told has happened to others.&quot; Those interviewed &quot;expressed a particular fear that criticizing the administration and its operation of the college could place a faculty member's appointment in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
<h3>Pharmacy school</h3>
<p>The Kentucky state budget, passed by the 2006 Kentucky legislature, includes $10 million of state debt to construct a pharmacy building on the school's Whitley County campus. Additionally, $1 million for scholarships for the pharmacy program are included. The $10 million building is to be funded out of a $100 million pool of money titled the &quot;infrastructure for economic development fund for coal-producing counties.&quot; Money to repay the bond issuance would come from coal <a>severance tax</a>es. The Kentucky Fairness Alliance asked Governor Ernie Fletcher to veto the $11 million that state lawmakers approved for a planned pharmacy school. A gay Kentucky State Senator, <a>Ernesto Scorsone</a>, has indicated that he would oppose spending the funds already allocated for a new pharmacy school for the university based on the Johnson situation, stating &quot;We should not be budgeting bigotry.&quot; &quot;If the University of the Cumberlands does not change its policies and practices, we will have a state benefit that is only available to heterosexuals,&quot; Scorsone said. If unaccredited, graduates of the pharmacy school could find their degrees unrecognized by employers, rendering them useless.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2008 Franklin Circuit Court Special Judge, Roger Crittenden, in response to a lawsuit brought by the Kentucky Fairness Alliance, in part over its objection to the university's decision to expel a gay student in 2006, issued an order that rendered the appropriations made for the pharmacy school an unconstitutional establishment of religion under Sections 2 and 189 of the Kentucky Constitution.  In addition, the court ruled that a permanent scholarship program created for the pharmacy school by the 2006-07 Kentucky Budget bill was in violation of Section 189 of the Kentucky Constitution.  Governor Steve Beshear has stated that the state does not plan to appeal this decision.</p>
<p>In 2010, the University of the Cumberlands signed a four-year agreement with <a>Midway College School of Pharmacy</a> which guarantees the admission of five Cumberland pre-pharmacy graduates each year.</p>
<h3>Broadway Baptist Church youth group</h3>
<p>The University of the Cumberlands rescinded its invitation to a youth group from Broadway Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, to help build homes for the poor, stating they did so because the church had been removed from the Southern Baptist Convention. This action was condemned by <a>Kentucky Equality Federation</a> because the church pastor stated officials told him it was because of their tolerance of homosexuality.</p>
