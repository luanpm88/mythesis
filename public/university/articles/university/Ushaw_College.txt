<p> <strong>Ushaw College</strong> (<strong>St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw</strong>) is a <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>seminary</a>, due to close in 2011.  It was founded at <a>Douai</a> as the <a>English College, Douai</a> in <a>France</a> in 1568, which moved to <a>Ushaw Moor</a>, four miles west of <a>Durham</a> in <a>England</a> in 1808 and became a <a>Licensed Hall</a> of the <a>University of Durham</a> in 1968. It is independent of the University but offers courses validated by the University.  Both Church and lay students study at the college.  In 2002 the College rejected a report from the Roman Catholic hierarchy that it should merge with <a>St Mary's College, Oscott</a>, near Birmingham.  In October 2010 it was announced that the college is to close in the summer of 2011 due to the shortage of vocations in the Roman Catholic Church, and that the site is likely to be sold.</p>
<p>Some of the college's buildings are no longer used, but some have been converted into a conference centre. The main college buildings are <a>grade II listed</a>, however the College Chapel is grade II* and the Chapel of St Michael is grade I. The Refectory was designed and built by <a>Pugin</a>, as was the original chapel although this was later dismantled and replaced by the present building designed by <a>Dunn and Hansom</a>. The original college buildings (1804&#x2013;1808) were designed by James Taylor.</p>
<h2>Heraldry</h2>
<p>The College <a>armorial bearings</a> are &quot;Per pale dexter Argent a Cross Gules on a Canton Azure a Cross of St Cuthbert proper sinister impaling Allen Argent three Rabbits couchant in pale Sable.&quot;</p>
