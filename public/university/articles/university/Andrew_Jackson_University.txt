<h2>Zero Tuition/Sponsored Tuition Program </h2>
<p>In July 2008, Andrew Jackson University introduced a sponsored tuition program that eliminates tuition, the major component of costs borne by students.  The program has generated a tremendous amount of interest from the education industry and students.  AJU President Don Kassner explained Andrew Jackson University&#x2019;s zero tuition program by saying, &#x201c;Most universities spend a tremendous amount of money to recruit students. Many spend as much as thirty-five percent of their revenue on marketing and advertising. They have to keep their tuition high to recover these costs. We eliminated these costs by structuring relationships with strategic partners that refer potential students to us. Therefore, we can operate a quality, degree granting institution without the escalating tuition and excessive fees deemed necessary by many schools.&#x201d; </p>
<p>Students wishing to attend AJU without paying tuition need only to apply using a marketing partner listed <a>on AJU's Partner's Section </a> of the university website.  After enrollment, students only pay small fees to stay enrolled. </p>
