<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decision to establish Belarusian State University, as a first national university of <a>Belarus</a>, was made on 25 February 1919 by the government of the <a>Byelorussian SSR</a>. However, <a>Minsk</a> was occupied by the Polish army at the time, and the university was actually established in 1921 in Minsk.</p>
<p><a>Vladimr Picheta</a>, historian and Slavonic languages expert, became first rector of the BSU. The university staff was formed by professors and lecturers transferred from universities of <a>Moscow</a>, <a>Kazan</a> and <a>Kiev</a>. Faculty consisted of 14 professors, 49 lecturers and 10 teaching assistants. First graduates left the BSU in 1925.</p>
<p>Initially there have been three Faculties - Workers, Medicine and Humanities with 1,390 students among them. In 1922 a new Pedagogical Faculty was established. In October 1927 post-graduate degrees became available.</p>
<p>During the 1930s the university became not only the key center for education and research in Soviet-controlled Belarus, but also led to branching out of specialized educational institutions and to the establishment of <a>Belarusian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>By 1941, just before the 20th anniversary of the university, there have been 6 Faculties: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, Biology, History, Geography and Languages. There have been 50 professors, 41 docents and 90 assistants (junior lecturers). There was also a Workers Faculty (providing part-time education to full-time employees of factories and plants) and special part-time <a>Polish</a>- and <a>Yiddish</a>-language sections.</p>
<p>In June 1941 Minsk was occupied by <a>Nazi Germany</a>; some students and academic staff were evacuated to the east, some joined the <a>Soviet Army</a> or partisan brigades. Some of university buildings were destroyed, some were used by the Germans as hospitals and offices.</p>
<p>In May 1943 Belarusian State University was re-established at <a>Skhodnya</a>, a suburban settlement to the north-east of <a>Moscow</a>. Some of former students and academics joined the re-established university. Its libraries were newly formed through donations from universities and colleges of Moscow.</p>
<p>In August 1944 first group of students and academic staff returned to Minsk, and regular classes re-started in autumn 1944. By September 1945 there have been over 300 students in the re-established university in Minsk. However, pre-war buildings and research facilities were not restored until late 1950. By then, there have been 7 Faculties, 35 professors, and 170 other academics at the BSU.</p>
<p>During the 1950s-1980s the university significantly evolved: new Faculties have been established, new buildings have been built, new research facilities have been added. Numbers of academic staff and students increased dramatically. In the former <a>USSR</a> Belarusian State University became one of key research and educational establishments and received several government awards for excellency.</p>
<p>Since <a>Belarus</a> independence (1991) the BSU continues to be the major university of the country. In the early 1990s it was a center of Belarusian national revival, with many lecturers (and even entire Faculties) choosing to switch from Russian to <a>Belarusian</a> as main language of teaching and research.</p>
