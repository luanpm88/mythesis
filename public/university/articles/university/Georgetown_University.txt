<p></p>
<p><strong>Georgetown University</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>Jesuit</a> university whose main campus is located in the <a>Washington, D.C.</a> neighborhood of <a>Georgetown</a> in the <a>United States</a>. The oldest <a>Catholic university</a> in the <a>United States</a>, Georgetown administers 180 programs in four <a>undergraduate</a> schools, three <a>graduate</a> and professional schools, and several specialized institutes. The faculty and programs in international affairs and law are especially well regarded. Georgetown's three urban campuses are laid out using quadrangles and rectangular lawns, with various facilities for research, sports, housing, and services. The main campus is known for the neo-Romanesque style <a>Healy Hall</a>, a designated <a>National Historic Landmark</a>. </p>
<p>Father <a>John Carroll</a>, later the first American bishop, founded the school in 1789, realizing efforts dating from 1634 to establish a Roman Catholic college in the <a>province of Maryland</a>. Georgetown expanded into a branched university after the <a>American Civil War</a> under the leadership of <a>Patrick Francis Healy</a>. Born a slave by law, Healy rose to become <a>university president</a> and is considered the school's second founder. Though governed independently of church authorities or the order, Jesuits have been officially involved in the school since 1805, and the institution defines its identity in significant part through its religious heritage. Tensions between this heritage and the school's support for academic freedom and its students' lifestyles have sometimes caused controversy on campus and within the broader Catholic community.</p>
<p>The university is <a>co-educational</a> and has around 7,000 <a>undergraduate</a> and over 8,000 <a>post-graduate</a> students, who in most years come from all 50 U.S. states and over 120 countries. Campus groups include the nation's oldest student theater group and the largest student-run business. Georgetown's most <a>notable alumni</a> have served in leadership positions in government in the United States and abroad; among them are former U.S. President <a>Bill Clinton</a>, U.S. Supreme Court Justice <a>Antonin Scalia</a>, and the current heads of state or government of six countries. The Georgetown athletic teams are called the <a>Hoyas</a>. Its <a>men's basketball team</a> leads the <a>Big East Conference</a> with seven <a>tournament championships</a> and has reached five <a>Final Four</a>s, winning the national championship in 1984.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p><a>Jesuit</a> settlers from <a>England</a> founded the <a>Province of Maryland</a> in 1634. However, the 1646 defeat of the <a>Royalists</a> in the <a>English Civil War</a> led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including <a>Andrew White</a>, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor. During the greater part of the Maryland colonial period, Jesuits continued to conduct Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the <a>American Revolution</a> in 1776 that long-term plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.</p>
<p>[[File:John Carroll statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in the center of campus|alt=A bronze statue of a man wearing long robes sitting in a chair on a cement podium in front of a Gothic style stone entrance.]] Following the Revolution, <a>Pope Pius VI</a> appointed <a>John Carroll</a> of <a>Maryland</a>, a former Jesuit, as the first <a>head of the Roman Church in America</a>, although the papal <a>suppression of the Jesuit order</a> was still in effect. Carroll orchestrated the early development of a new university, and on January 23, 1789 obtained the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was built.</p>
<p>In its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local Jesuit-owned lands. The Maryland Society of Jesus was restored in 1805 and given supervision of the school, which bolstered confidence in the college. The <a>United States Congress</a> issued Georgetown the first federal <a>university charter</a> in 1815, which allowed it to confer degrees. The college's first two graduates were awarded the degree of <a>bachelor of arts</a> two years later in 1817. In 1844, the school received a <a>corporate</a> charter, under the name &quot;The President and Directors of Georgetown College&quot;, affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the <a>Medical School</a> was founded in 1851.</p>
<h3>Civil War</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Union soldiers across the Potomac River from Georgetown University|alt=Black and white photo of several military men idling on a river bank. Across the river are several large buildings.</a> The <a>U.S. Civil War</a> greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141&nbsp;students and alumni enlisted and the <a>Union Army</a> commandeered university buildings. Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.</p>
<p>Enrollment did not recover from the war until the presidency of <a>Patrick Francis Healy</a> from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law, Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American university with <a>African heritage</a>. He is credited with reforming the undergraduate <a>curriculum</a>, lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the <a>Alumni Association</a>. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named <a>Healy Hall</a> in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's &quot;second founder.&quot;</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on <a>higher education</a>. <a>Georgetown Preparatory School</a> relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927. The <a>School of Foreign Service</a> (SFS) was founded in 1919 by <a>Edmund A. Walsh</a>, to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy.</p>
<p>Besides expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand their resources and their student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969&#x2013;1970 <a>academic year</a>, Georgetown became fully <a>coeducation</a>al. Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing <a>Leo J. O'Donovan</a> as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build the school's endowment. In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1&nbsp;billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects. <a>John J. DeGioia</a>, Georgetown's first lay president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its financial modernization and sought to &quot;expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue&quot;, such as opening a campus in <a>Qatar</a>.</p>
<h3>Jesuit tradition</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Students studying outside Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence|alt=Three young adults lie on grass reading books in front of a brick building with many windows.</a></p>
<p>Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of <a>Ignatius of Loyola</a> and is a member of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>. Georgetown is not a <a>pontifical university</a>, though three Jesuits serve on the forty member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance. Fifty-nine members of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> live on campus, and are mostly employed by Georgetown as professors or administrators. While most live in the Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence on the main campus, some serve as <a>chaplain</a>s-in-residence and live in the undergraduate dormitories.  Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.</p>
<p>The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has played in its policies has been controversial at times. For instance, stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to sell or distribute <a>birth control</a> products. <a>Georgetown University Hospital</a>, operated by <a>MedStar Health</a>, and <a>Georgetown University Medical Center</a> function under the <em>Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Services</em>, which prohibits abortions from being performed on the premises. The hospital does perform research using <a>embryonic stem cells</a>. Georgetown has also been criticized by groups including the <a>Cardinal Newman Society</a> and protested against for hosting prominent <a>pro-choice</a> politicians as speakers on campus, such as <a>John Kerry</a> and <a>Barack Obama</a>.</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 1999, <a>crucifix</a>es were added to many classroom walls, attracting national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. Pressure to remove the crucifixes comes, however, from within the Catholic community, while campus leaders of other faiths have defended their placement. The <a>Intercultural Center</a> is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>[[File:Healy Pink.jpg|thumb|[[Healy Hall]] houses classrooms, the university's executive body and Gaston Hall.|alt=A large Gothic style stone building dominated by a tall clocktower with a pinkish sunset behind it.]] As of Fall 2008, the University has 7,092&nbsp;undergraduate students, 5,330&nbsp;graduate students on the main campus, 2,083&nbsp;students at the <a>Law Center</a>, 813&nbsp;students in the <a>School of Medicine</a>, and 145 at the <a>School of Foreign Service in Qatar</a>. <a>Bachelor's</a> programs are offered through <a>Georgetown College</a>, the <a>School of Nursing and Health Studies</a>, the <a>Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business</a>, the <a>School of Continuing Studies</a>, and the <a>Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service</a>, which includes the Qatar campus. Some high school students from <a>Georgetown Visitation</a> are permitted to attend classes for <a>Advanced Placement</a> credit.</p>
<p>Georgetown University offers undergraduate degrees in forty-eight <a>majors</a> in the four undergraduate schools, as well as the opportunity for students to design their own individualized courses of study. All majors in the College are open as minors to students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service cannot receive minors, but can complete certificates instead. All courses are on a <a>credit hour</a> system.</p>
<p><a>Master's</a> and <a>doctoral</a> programs are offered through the <a>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</a>, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, and the School of Continuing Studies. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The <a>Center for Contemporary Arab Studies</a> and the <a>Public Policy Institute</a> are both research centers which also offer masters degrees. Masters students occasionally share some advanced <a>seminar</a>s with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following completion of the undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>Each graduate school offers at least one <a>double degree</a> with another graduate school. Additionally, the Law Center offers a joint degree with the <a>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>. The School of Continuing Studies includes the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, and operates four types of degree programs, over thirty professional certificates and non-degree courses, undergraduate and <a>graduate degrees in Liberal Studies</a>, as well as summer courses for graduates, undergraduates, and high school students.</p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>
<p> [[File:John J. DeGioia at the World Economic Forum Summit on the Global Agenda 2008.jpg|thumb|University president [[John J. DeGioia]] is also a faculty member.|alt=A bald middle aged man in a suit at a table speaks into microphone. Behind him several signs read World Economic Forum.]] As of 2008, Georgetown University employs approximately 1,268&nbsp;full-time and 689&nbsp;part-time faculty members across its three <a>Washington, D.C.</a> campuses, with an additional thirty-two at <a>SFS-Qatar</a>. The faculty comprises leading academics and notable political and business leaders, and are predominantly male by a two-to-one margin. Politically, Georgetown University's faculty members give more support to liberal candidates, and while their donation patterns are generally consistent with those of other American university faculties, they gave more than average to <a>Barack Obama's presidential campaign</a>.</p>
<p>The current faculty includes scholars such as the former President of the <a>American Philological Association</a> <a>James J. O'Donnell</a>, theologian <a>John Haught</a>, political theorist <a>James V. Schall</a>, social activists Sam Marullo and <a>Chai Feldblum</a>, and preeminent hip-hop scholar <a>Michael Eric Dyson</a>. Many former politicians choose to teach at Georgetown, including <a>U.S. Agency for International Development</a> administrator <a>Andrew Natsios</a>, National Security Advisor <a>Anthony Lake</a>, U.S. Senator <a>Chuck Hagel</a>, and CIA director <a>George Tenet</a>. Internationally, the school attracts numerous former <a>ambassador</a>s and <a>heads of state</a>, such as Secretary of State <a>Madeleine Albright</a>, Ambassador <a>Turki bin Faisal Al Saud</a>, Prime Minister of Spain <a>Jos&#x00e9; Mar&#x00ed;a Aznar</a>, and President of Colombia <a>Alvaro Uribe</a>.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>[[File:Lauinger Library.jpg|thumb|[[Lauinger Library]], Georgetown's main library, was built in 1970.|alt=A large brutalist building with a tall boxlike structure at its front entrance siting in front of a wide green lawn with several trees and a brick walkway.]]</p>
<p>Georgetown University is a self-described &quot;student-centered research university&quot; considered by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> to have &quot;very high research activity&quot;.  As of 2002, Georgetown's libraries hold 2,425,354&nbsp;items and 48,622&nbsp;<a>serials</a> in seven buildings, with most in <a>Lauinger Library</a>. Georgetown faculty conduct research in hundreds of subjects, but have priorities in the fields of religion, ethics, science, public policy, and cancer medicine. Cross-institutional research is performed with <a>Columbia University</a> and <a>Virginia Tech</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008, Georgetown spent $143 million on research, ranking it 111th nationwide. In 2007, it received about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, with sixty-four percent from the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, the <a>United States Department of Energy</a>, and the <a>Department of Defense</a>. <a>Georgetown University Medical Center</a> received an additional $118.4 million from these and other government sources. Georgetown's Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough <a>HPV vaccine</a> for cervical cancer in 2006.</p>
<p>Centers which conduct and sponsor research at Georgetown include the <a>Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs</a>, the <a>Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim&#x2013;Christian Understanding</a> and the <a>Woodstock Theological Center</a>. Regular publications include the <em><a>Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy</a></em>, the <em><a>Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal</a></em>, the <em><a>Georgetown Law Journal</a></em>, the <em><a>Georgetown Journal of International Affairs</a></em>, and the <em><a>Georgetown Public Policy Review</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p> With 18,070 applications and 3,483 admitted for the class of 2014, Georgetown has an overall undergraduate acceptance rate of 19.3%. As of 2008, Georgetown's graduate schools have acceptance rates of twenty-nine percent to the <a>MBA program</a>, twenty-three percent to the <a>Law Center</a>, and only three percent to the <a>School of Medicine</a>. In 2004, a <a>National Bureau of Economic Research</a> study on revealed preference of U.S. colleges showed that Georgetown was the 16th most-preferred choice. In 2010, Georgetown University was ranked 155th in the <a>QS World University Rankings</a>, and twenty-first in the United States by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.</p>
<p>The undergraduate schools maintain a restrictive <a>Early Action</a> admissions program, as students who have applied through an <a>Early Decision</a> process at another school are not permitted to apply early to Georgetown. The middle fifty percent of accepted students had <a>SAT</a> scores ranging from 680&#x2013;760 in Critical Reading, and 670&#x2013;760 in Math. Georgetown does not consider the writing portion of the SAT in admissions.  Over fifty-five percent of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets one-hundred percent of demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $22,000 and about seventy percent of aid distributed in the forms of grants or scholarships.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Georgetown University's main campus is built on a rise above the Potomac River.|alt=A panorama of numerous buildings, particularly the tall clocktower, above a stretch of brightly colored autumn trees all reflected in a river.</a></p>
<p>Georgetown University has three campuses in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>: the undergraduate campus, the <a>Medical Center</a>, and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the <a>Georgetown neighborhood</a> and form the main campus. Georgetown also operates a facility in <a>Doha</a>, <a>Qatar</a>, and villas in <a>Alanya</a>, <a>Turkey</a> and <a>Fiesole</a>, <a>Italy</a>. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at <a>Clarendon</a> in <a>Arlington, Virginia</a>. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional <a>quadrangle</a> design.</p>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>Georgetown University's undergraduate campus and medical school campus are situated on an elevated site above the <a>Potomac River</a>, overlooking <a>Northern Virginia</a>. The main gates, known as the <em>Healy Gates</em>, are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets, NW. <a>Georgetown University Medical Center</a> is on a property adjacent to the northwestern part of the undergraduate campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated with <a>Georgetown University Hospital</a>, which is operated by <a>MedStar Health</a>.</p>
<p>The main campus is just over  in area and includes sixty-four buildings, student residences capable of accommodating eighty percent of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities. Most buildings employ <a>collegiate Gothic</a> architecture and <a>Georgian brick architecture</a>. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles. The main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle, although Red Square has replaced it as the focus of student life. <a>Healy Hall</a>, built in <a>Flemish Romanesque</a> style from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, and is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>. Both Healy Hall and the <a>Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory</a>, built in 1844, are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2003, the school completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project, and brought a new 907-bed student dorm, an expansive dining hall, an underground parking facility, and new Jesuit Residence to the campus. The school's first <a>performing arts center</a>, named for <a>Royden B. Davis</a>, was completed in November 2005, and the new business school building, named for <a>Rafik Hariri</a>, opened in Fall 2009. Future construction plans include a unified sciences center and expanded athletic facilities. As a location, <a>Georgetown</a> is ranked nationally in the ten best college towns by the <a>Princeton Review</a>. Despite this, main campus &quot;<a>town and gown</a>&quot; relations are often strained by facilities construction, enlargement of the student body, as well as noise and alcohol violations. Crime is also a persistent issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008.</p>
<h3>Law Center campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Hotung International Law Center and GULC fitness center were built in 2005.|alt=Two modern glass and concrete building side by side in front of an open grass lawn which has a short clocktower on the left side.</a></p>
<p>The <a>Law Center campus</a> is located in the <a>Capitol Hill neighborhood</a> on New Jersey Avenue, near <a>Union Station</a> and consists of five buildings. First-year students at the Law Center can live in the single on-campus dormitory, the Gewirz Student Center. Most second- and third-year students, as well as some first-year students, live off-campus. As there is little housing near the Law Center, most are spread throughout the Washington metropolitan area. The &quot;Campus Completion Project&quot;, finished in 2005, saw the addition of the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center. G Street and F Street are closed off between 1st and 2nd Streets to create open lawns flanking McDonough Hall, the main building on the campus.</p>
<h3>Facilities abroad</h3>
<p>[[File:Villa le balze 01.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Villa Le Balze]] in Fiesole, Italy hosts interdisciplinary studies.|alt=A yellow stucco building with a red clay roof and several arched doors and windows, surrounded by green shrubs.]] In December 1979, the <a>Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain</a>, granddaughter of <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>, gave the <a>Villa Le Balze</a> to Georgetown University. The Villa is in <a>Fiesole</a>, <a>Italy</a>, on a hill above the city of <a>Florence</a>. The Villa is used year-round for study abroad programs focused on specialized <a>interdisciplinary</a> study of <a>Italian culture</a> and civilization. The main facility for the <a>McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies</a> was donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former <a>United States Ambassador to Turkey</a> <a>George C. McGhee</a>. The school is in the town of <a>Alanya</a>, <a>Turkey</a> within the <a>Seljuq</a>-era <a>Alanya Castle</a>, on the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>. The Center operates study abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on <a>Turkish language</a>, <a>architectural history</a>, and <a>Islamic studies</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a>Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development</a> presented the <a>School of Foreign Service</a> with the resources and space to open a facility in the new <a>Education City</a> in <a>Doha</a>, <a>Qatar</a>. <a>SFS-Qatar</a> opened in 2005 as a liberal arts and international affairs undergraduate school for regional students. In December 2007, Georgetown opened a liaison office in <a>Shanghai</a>, <a>China</a> to coordinate with <a>Fudan University</a> and others. In 2008, the <a>Georgetown University Law Center</a> in conjunction with an international consortium of law schools established the <a>Center for Transnational Legal Studies</a> in <a>London</a>, <a>England</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p> The Georgetown undergraduate student body is composed primarily of students from outside the <a>District of Columbia</a>, with one-third from <a>Mid-Atlantic states</a>. As of fall 2009, the racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 62.3% <a>white</a>, 8.8% <a>Asian</a>, 6.3% <a>black</a>, and 5.9% <a>Hispanic</a>; Additionally, 55.2% of undergraduates are female. The largest minority, with twelve percent of the full-time student body, is <a>international</a>, representing 120 countries. Of undergraduates, nine percent are classified as non-resident <a>aliens</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Students celebrate Georgetown Day in late spring with a campus carnival.|alt=Many students mingle in the background while a group sit in the foreground on a grass lawn. The large stone clocktower is seen above the trees on the lawn.</a> Although it is a Jesuit university, only 41.2% of the student body identify as <a>Roman Catholic</a>, while 22.2% identify as <a>Protestant</a> as of 2009. Georgetown employs a full-time <a>rabbi</a>, as 6.5% of undergraduates are <a>Jew</a>ish. Georgetown also sponsors student groups for <a>Bah&#x00e1;&#x2019;i</a>, <a>Buddhist</a>, <a>Hindu</a>, and <a>Mormon</a> traditions. The student body is generally religious and volunteer minded, and more than four-hundred <a>freshmen</a> and transfer students attend a nonreligious <a>Ignatian</a> <a>retreat</a> annually. A 2007 survey of undergraduates also suggests that 62.8% are sexually active, while 6.2% identify as <a>LGBTQ</a>. Discrimination can be a issue on campus, and three-fourths of a 2009 survey considered <a>homophobia</a> a campus problem. <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> however rated Georgetown among its top &quot;Gay-Friendly Schools&quot; in 2010.</p>
<p>Almost all undergraduates attend full-time. A majority of undergraduates, seventy-two percent, live on-campus in several dormitories and apartment complexes. The remainder live off-campus, mostly in the <a>Georgetown</a>, <a>Glover Park</a>, <a>Burleith</a>, and <a>Foxhall</a> neighborhoods. Although many of the University's hall directors and area coordinators attend graduate level courses, on-campus housing is not available for main campus graduate students. The school hopes to build such housing by 2020. All students in the Medical School live off-campus, most in the surrounding neighborhoods, with some in <a>Northern Virginia</a> and elsewhere through the region.</p>
<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p>Georgetown University has 172&nbsp;registered student organizations that cover a variety of interests: student government, club sports, media and publications, performing arts, religion, and volunteer and service. Students also operate campus stores, banks, and medical services. Students often find their interests at the Student Activities Commission Club Fair, where both official and unofficial organizations set up tables. The <a>Georgetown University Student Association</a> is the student government organization for undergraduates. There are also student representatives within the schools, to the Board of Directors, and, since 1996, to the Georgetown <a>Advisory Neighborhood Commission</a>. <a>thumb|left|Students volunteer at a D.C. inner-city school|alt=Two young white men sit at a table with several teenage African American students mingle around it, and one signs a paper on it. Also on the table is a laptop.</a></p>
<p>Georgetown's student organizations include one of the nation's oldest debating clubs, the <a>Philodemic Society</a>, founded in 1830, and the oldest university theater group, the <a>Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society</a>. Nomadic Theatre, founded in 1982 as an alternative troupe without an on-campus home, produces &quot;plays which educate and challenge all members of the university community through thought-provoking theatre.&quot;  <a>The Georgetown Improv Association</a>, founded in 1995, performs monthly long-form <a>improvisational</a> shows on-campus at Bulldog Alley in addition to hosting &quot;Improvfest,&quot; one of the <a>oldest improv festivals in the country</a>. There are a total of seven <em><a>a cappella</a></em> groups on campus, including the Phantoms, Superfood, The Gracenotes, The Chimes, Harmony, the service-oriented Saxatones, and the all-male Capitol G's.  These groups perform annually at the &quot;D.C. A Cappella Festival,&quot; held since 1991, and the &quot;Cherry Tree Massacre&quot; concert, held since 1974. The Georgetown University Band is composed of the Georgetown Pep Band and the Georgetown Wind Ensemble, and performs on campus, in Washington, D.C., and at post-season basketball tournaments.</p>
<p>In addition to student organizations and clubs, Georgetown University is home to the nation&#x2019;s largest entirely student-owned and&nbsp;-operated corporation, <a>Students of Georgetown, Inc.</a> Known as &quot;The Corp&quot;, the business has an annual gross revenue of over $4 million. The Corp's profits are directly re-invested into the Georgetown student body through Corp Philanthropy, which gives out over $30,000 in scholarships and donations to Georgetown groups every year. Founded in 1972, The Corp operates three <a>coffee shops</a> and two <a>grocery stores</a>. It also runs storage and airport shuttles for students. <a>Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union</a> is the oldest and largest student-run financial institution, with over $16 million in assets and 12,000 members.</p>
<p>Another student-run group, the <a>Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service</a>, &quot;GERMS&quot;, is an all-volunteer ambulance service founded in 1982 that serves campus and the surrounding communities. GUGS, the Georgetown University Grilling Society, has been a Georgetown tradition since 2002, selling half-pound hamburgers in Red Square on most Fridays. The <a>Georgetown University Student Investment Fund</a> is one of a few undergraduate-run <a>investment fund</a>s in the United States, and hosted CNBC's <a>Jim Cramer</a> to tape <em><a>Mad Money</a></em> in September 2006. Georgetown's <a>Army</a> <a>ROTC</a> unit, the Hoya Battalion, is the oldest military unit native to the District of Columbia. The proportion of ROTC students at Georgetown is also the eleventh highest among all universities in the United States as of 2007.</p>
<h3>Activism</h3>
<p>[[File:Intercultural Center.jpg|thumb|Red Square in front of the [[Edward B. Bunn S.J. Intercultural Center|Intercultural Center]] is often used for campus activism.|alt=Many students and adults walk on a red brick plaza in front of a large red brick building with sharp geometric sides and a steep roof.]] Georgetown University student organizations include a diverse array of groups focused on social justice issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice. Oriented against gender violence, <a>Take Back the Night</a> coordinates an annual rally and march to protest against rape and other forms of violence against women. <a>Georgetown Solidarity Committee</a> is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises for both university cleaning staff and police.  Georgetown Students for <a>Fair Trade</a> successfully advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias to be <a>Fair Trade Certified</a>.</p>
<p>Georgetown has many additional groups representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's student body is particularly active in politics; groups based on local, national, and international issues are popular, and free speech is generally respected. Student political organizations are active on campus and engage their many members in local and national politics. The Georgetown University College Republicans represent the political right and, on the left, the Georgetown University College Democrats was the largest student organization on campus in 2008.</p>
<p>The <a>reproductive rights</a> organization H*yas for Choice is not officially recognized by the University as its positions on <a>abortion</a> are in opposition to University policy, prompting the asterisk in &quot;hoyas&quot;. While not financially supported by the school, the organization is permitted to meet and table in university spaces. In 2010, the &quot;Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice&quot; campaign led several protests against the school policy against the sale of birth control on campus, and in 2007, <a>Georgetown University Law Center</a> students protested the University's decision to cease funding for a student's internship at <a>Planned Parenthood</a>'s litigation department despite funding it previous years. The issue contributes to Georgetown's 'red light' status on free speech under the <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> rating system.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Georgetown University has several student-run newspapers. <em><a>The Hoya</a></em> is the University's oldest newspaper. It has been in print since 1920, and since 1987, has been published twice weekly. <em><a>The Georgetown Voice</a></em>, known for its weekly cover stories, is a <a>newsmagazine</a> that was founded in March 1969 to focus more attention on citywide and national issues. <em>The Georgetown Independent</em> is a monthly journal of news, commentary and the arts. Founded in 1966, the <em><a>Georgetown Law Weekly</a></em> is the student-run paper on the <a>Law Center</a> campus, and is a three time winner of the <a>American Bar Association</a>'s Best Newspaper award. </em>[[File:The Hoya office.jpg|thumb|left|<em>[[The Hoya]]<em> student newspaper office in the Leavey Center|alt=Several young men and women sit in office chairs working at computers around a room where the walls are covered in printed pages. A central wood table and bookcases are featured.]]</em></p>
<p><em>The Georgetown Academy</em>, restarted in 2008 after a hiatus, targets traditionalist <a>Catholic</a> readers, and the <em>Georgetown Federalist</em>, founded in 2006, purports to bring a <a>conservative</a> and <a>libertarian</a> viewpoint to campus. <em>The Fire This Time</em> is Georgetown's only minority newssource. <em><a>The Georgetown Heckler</a></em> is a humor magazine founded on the Internet in 2003 by Georgetown students, releasing its first print issue in 2007. <em><a>The Gonzo</a></em> was a former student humor magazine, published from 1993 to 1998. <em>The Hoya</em> and <em>The Georgetown Voice</em> both run online blogs, and there are other popular blogs written about the school and its sports teams.</p>
<p>The University has a campus-wide television station, <a>GUTV</a>, which began broadcasting in 1999. The station hosts an annual student <a>film festival</a> in April for campus filmmakers. <a>WGTB</a>, Georgetown's radio station, is available as a <a>webcast</a> and on 92.3 FM in certain dormitories. The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from 1960 to 1979, when university president <a>Timothy S. Healy</a> gave away the frequency and broadcast capabilities to the <a>University of the District of Columbia</a> because of WGTB's <a>far left</a> political orientation.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>[[File:DPE House.jpg|thumb|upright|3401 Prospect St, home to [[Delta Phi Epsilon (professional)|&#x0394;&#x03a6;&#x0395;]], is used by other Greek societies.|alt=A yellow three story town house with steps in front and a small lawn with shrubs and trees.]]</p>
<p>Although Jesuit schools are not obliged to disassociate from Greek systems, many do, and Georgetown University does not officially recognize or fund <a>fraternities, sororities</a>, or <a>secret societies</a> among the student body. Despite this, Greek organizations persist on campus, although none require members to live in fraternal housing. Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.</p>
<p>Active fraternities at Georgetown include <a>Delta Phi Epsilon</a>, a professional foreign service fraternity; <a>Alpha Kappa Psi</a>, a professional business fraternity; <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, a national co-ed community service fraternity; <a>Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>, a Jewish social fraternity; and social fraternities <a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a> and <a>Zeta Psi</a>. Delta Phi Epsilon was founded at Georgetown in 1920, and members of their Alpha Chapter include Jesuits and several deans of the <a>School of Foreign Service</a>. The Delta Phi Epsilon foreign service sorority, founded in 1973, is the only sorority active at Georgetown. Georgetown's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi, affiliated with the <a>campus Hillel</a>, was established in 2002. Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered its chapter as a general social fraternity in 2007. The Omega Lambda chapter of professional business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi replaced <a>Delta Sigma Pi</a>, which lost its charter in 2006.</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Annual events on campus celebrate Georgetown traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. In late April, Georgetown University celebrates <em>Georgetown Day</em>. Besides the full-day carnival, the day rewards the best professor of the year with the Dorothy Brown Award, as voted by students. <a>Halloween</a> is celebrated with public viewings of alumnus <a>William Peter Blatty</a>'s film <em><a>The Exorcist</a></em>, which takes place in the neighborhood surrounding the university.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Gaston Hall is a venue for many events.|alt=A speaker at a podium in the center of a stage decorated with nine American flags and a red carpet.</a> <a>Homecoming</a> coincides with a home football game, and festivities such as tailgating and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni Association to draw past graduates back to campus. The largest planned sports related celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed <em>Midnight Madness</em>, this event introduces the men's and women's basketball teams shortly after midnight on the first day the teams are allowed by NCAA rules to formally practice together. In 2011, Georgetown will again play host to a first round division of the <a>NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament</a>.</p>
<p>Georgetown University hosts notable speakers each year, largely because of the success of the <a>Georgetown Lecture Fund</a> and the Office of Communications. These are frequently important <a>heads of state</a> who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as <a>Nostra &#x00c6;tate</a>, <a>Pacem in Terris</a>, and the Building Bridges Seminar.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  <a>thumb|right|Students cheering for Georgetown's men's basketball team|alt=Five young shirtless men pose defiantly in a crowd. Each has a letter in blue on their chests to spell HOYAS.</a></p>
<p>Georgetown fields 23 varsity teams and the Club Sports Board supports an additional 23 club teams. The varsity teams participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a>. The school generally competes in the <a>Big East Conference</a>, although the <a>football</a> team competes in the <a>Division I FCS</a> <a>Patriot League</a>, the sailing team in <a>Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association</a>, and the rowing teams in the <a>Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges</a>. Georgetown University graduates over ninety percent of its student athletes. <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> listed Georgetown's athletics program among the 20 best in the nation.</p>
<p>The school's teams are called &quot;Hoyas&quot;, a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, students well versed in classical languages invented the mixed <a>Greek</a> and <a>Latin</a> chant of &quot;<a>Hoya Saxa</a>&quot;, translating roughly as &quot;what (or such) rocks&quot;. The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers to one of these teams. The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. <a>Jack the Bulldog</a> has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, and the school <a>fight song</a> is <em><a>There Goes Old Georgetown</a></em>.</p>
<p>The <a>men's basketball</a> team is particularly noteworthy as it won the <a>NCAA championship</a> in <a>1984</a> under coach <a>John Thompson</a>. The current coach is his son, <a>John Thompson III</a>, who coached the team to the <a>Final Four</a> in the <a>2007 NCAA tournament</a>. The team leads the Big East with seven <a>conference tournament</a> titles, and has made twenty-six <a>NCAA tournament appearances</a>. Well-known team alumni include <a>Sleepy Floyd</a>, <a>Patrick Ewing</a>, <a>Dikembe Mutombo</a>, <a>Alonzo Mourning</a>, <a>Allen Iverson</a>, <a>Jeff Green</a>, and <a>Roy Hibbert</a>. Besides <a>basketball</a>, Georgetown is nationally successful in <a>rowing</a>, <a>sailing</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, and <a>track and field</a>. In all, over one-hundred student athletes have gone on to play professionally.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
