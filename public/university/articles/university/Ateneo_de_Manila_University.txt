<p>The <strong>Ateneo de Manila University</strong> (also called <strong><em>Ateneo de Manila</em></strong> or simply the <strong><em>Ateneo</em></strong>) is a <a>private</a> <a>teaching</a> and <a>research</a> <a>university</a> run by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in the <a>Philippines</a>. It began in 1859 when the City of <a>Manila</a> handed control of the <em>Escuela Municipal de Manila</em> in <a>Intramuros</a>, <a>Manila</a>, to the Jesuits. It was then a state-subsidized school. It became a private school during the American occupation of the Philippines, and has moved from Manila to its current location. It received its university charter in 1959. </p>
<p>Its main campus in <a>Loyola Heights</a>, <a>Quezon City</a>, <a>Metro Manila</a> is home to the university's <a>college and graduate school</a> units, as well as its high school and grade school. Two other campuses, in <a>Rockwell Center</a> and Salcedo Village, both in <a>Makati City</a>, house the university's professional schools of <a>business</a>, <a>law</a>, and <a>government</a>. A fourth facility in the Don Eugenio L&#x00f3;pez, Sr. Medical Complex in Ortigas Center, <a>Pasig City</a> houses its school of <a>medicine and public health</a>.</p>
<p>The Ateneo offers programs in the elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Its academic offerings include the <a>Art</a>s, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Business</a>, <a>Law</a>, the <a>Social Sciences</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Theology</a>, <a>Medicine</a> and <a>Public Health</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Computer Science</a> and <a>Information Technology</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Environmental Science</a>, and <a>Government</a>. Aside from teaching and research, the Ateneo de Manila also engages in social outreach.</p>
<p>It was one of only two universities in the Philippines to receive Level IV <a>accreditation</a>--the highest possible level&#x2014;from the <a>Commission on Higher Education</a> (CHED) through the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP) and the <a>Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities</a> (PAASCU). Its Level IV accreditation granted in June 2004, has since lapsed.  It is also one of few universities granted autonomous status by CHED, which likewise recognizes a number of the University's programs and departments as Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development. </p>
<p>Its grade school and high school have been granted Level III accreditation by PAASCU and FAAP, the highest possible level for basic education. </p>
<p>Among the Ateneo's alumni are <a>Jos&#x00e9; Rizal</a>, the National Hero of the Philippines. Several <a>Philippine Presidents</a>, including the incumbent <a>Benigno Aquino III</a>, as well as his predecessors <a>Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a>, <a>Joseph Estrada</a>, and <a>Fidel Ramos</a>, and <a>Corazon Aquino</a> are alumni of or have ties with the university. Also among its graduates are several leaders of the propaganda movement during Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Philippine-American War, politicians, political activists, professionals, businessmen, writers, scientists, educators, and artists. This body of alumni was all-male until women were admitted to its graduate programs, and later, to its college. </p>
<p>The University's patron saint is <a>Ignatius of Loyola</a>, while <a>Mar&#x00ed;a Pur&#x00ed;ssima</a> is its patroness, as is evident the pontifical name &quot;University of the Immaculate Conception&quot; and in the selection of blue and white as the school's colors. The patron saint of its <a>law school</a> is <a>Thomas More</a>, the high school has <a>Stanislaus Kostka</a> as its patron, and the grade school the <a>Holy Guardian Angels</a> as its patrons.</p>
<h2>Institution</h2>
<p>The Ateneo de Manila University operates from several campuses in <a>Metro Manila</a>, with each campus housing academic and research units. Several thousand faculty members serve a student body in different academic levels, from elementary to postgraduate. The Loyola Schools have around 8,000 undergraduate students and around 3,000 graduate students making the Ateneo small, in terms of population, relative to many other Philippine universities.</p>
<p>The University began operations in 1859 when the City of <a>Manila</a> turned over the Escuela Municipal de Manila, a public primary school in <a>Intramuros</a>, to Spanish Jesuits. The school took the name Ateneo when it began offering secondary education in 1865, and has since grown into a university engaged in teaching, research, and social outreach. Its academic programs are geared towards research coupled with real-world output through which the university and its community engage social problems, especially in areas of national development and addressing poverty.</p>
<h3>Social initiatives</h3>
<p>[[Image:Church of the gesu.jpg|thumb|The [[Church of the Ges&#x00f9; (Philippines)|Church of the Ges&#x00f9;]]]] The Ateneo has grounded its vision and mission in Jesuit educational tradition. Because of the Jesuit educational tradition of engagement with the world at large, the university is involved with civic work. Social involvement is a key part of Ateneo education, being integrated into the curricula of practically all university programs.</p>
<p>Some of the Ateneo's social projects include the Ateneo-Mangyan Project for Understanding and Development (AMPUD) and Bigay Puso in grade school; and the Christian Service and Involvement Program, Damay Immersion, and Tulong Dunong program for senior students in high school. In college, social development is fostered by programs of the Office of Social Concern and Involvement, including house-builds with Gawad Kalinga, and the Ateneo Labor Trials Program tied into junior Philosophy classes. Student organizations and offices of the Loyola Schools also operate their own social involvement programs. At the Ateneo Professional Schools, programs and units like the Graduate School of Business' Mulat-Diwa, the Leaders for Health Program, the Law School's Human Rights Center and Legal Aid programs aim to form leaders.</p>
<h3>Administration</h3>
<pre> The Ateneo de Manila is governed by a Board of Trustees, chaired by alumnus Edward Go, who succeeded former Chairman <a>Manuel V. Pangilinan</a>. A central administration, led by the outgoing <a>University President</a>, <a>Fr. Bienvenido F. Nebres, S.J.</a>, oversees key initiatives related to academics, international programs, university development and alumni relations, personnel, security, and other university-wide concerns. Fr. Nebres will be replaced by <a>Fr. Jose Ramon T. Villarin, S.J.</a> on April 1, 2011.</p>
<p>Individual units and departments are usually led by a vice president, with the exception of the basic education units, led by a director who oversees the leadership of both the High School's principal and the Grade School's headmaster. The Loyola Schools and Professional Schools are led by their respective vice presidents, who oversee school deans, who in turn oversee department chairs and program directors.</p>
<h3>Admissions and financial aid</h3>
<p>The Ateneo receives thousands of applications every year. Individual units, such as the Loyola Schools, the Ateneo Professional Schools, and the Ateneo de Manila Grade School and High School, handle their own admissions. Admission into one unit does not guarantee admission into another unit. Applications from foreigners to the college and graduate school programs are quite common.  In 2005, the Loyola Schools admitted 2,023 freshmen, a figure larger than the projected average of 1,800 freshmen from recent years. 20% of the entering class was composed of valedictorians (83), salutatorians (62), and honorable mention graduates (277). </p>
<p>For the Loyola Schools, admissions are largely determined by a prospective student's passing the Ateneo College Entrance Test (ACET), a privately-administered examination. Individual degree programs have unpublished cut-off scores for admission, although for degree programs designated as &quot;honors&quot; programs, an examinee must have scored in at least the top 15% in order to be admitted. </p>
<p>The university also extends financial aid to students. Scholarships are available in all academic units, with funding coming from the university, third parties, and donations made by alumni, the government, and the private sector. The Loyola Schools offer Merit Scholarships for the top scorers in the ACET, and the San Ignacio Merit Scholarships are given to top ACET takers from public high schools. Applicants who belong to the top 2% of ACET takers are included in the Ateneo Freshman Director's List. However, they do not receive a tuition and fees scholarship.</p>
<h3>University units</h3>
<p>The Ateneo de Manila University is composed of school units and auxiliary units. Affiliated units contribute to the work of the different school and auxiliary units, facilitating the work of learning, teaching, research, and social involvement. Individual units enjoy a considerable amount of autonomy from the central administration.</p>
<h4>Professional Schools</h4>
<p>The Ateneo Professional Schools (APS) is the main professional education division of Ateneo de Manila. The Professional Schools offer degrees such as <a>Master of Business Administration</a> and <a>Master of Arts</a>, and the Law School confers the <a>Juris Doctor</a> (JD) degree in lieu of the <a>Bachelor of Laws</a> (LLB) degree. The Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, which opened in 2007, offers an integrated <a>Doctor of Medicine</a> and <a>Master of Business Administration</a> program. The Professional Schools also confer certificates for short courses.</p>

<h4>Loyola Schools</h4>
<p> <a>thumb| Xavier Hall at the Loyola Heights Campus houses the Loyola Schools administration in its ground floor and the Central administration on the second floor</a></p>
<p>The Loyola Schools offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the arts and sciences. It is composed of four schools, the School of Humanities, the John Gokongwei School of Management, the School of Science and Engineering, and the School of Social Sciences. The current Vice-President for the Loyola Schools is Professor <a>John Paul Vergara</a> (PhD Computer Science and Applications, <a>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a>). He replaced Professor <a>Ma. Assunta C. Cuyegkeng</a> (PhD Chemistry, <a>University of Regensburg</a>). Vice-President Vergara assumed the post in April 2010.</p>
<p>The Loyola Schools' programs are geared toward student-centeredness. The Ateneo was one of the first schools in the Philippines to enact a <a>Magna Carta</a> for Undergraduates.</p>
<p>The Commission on Higher Education has designated several departments and programs of the Loyola Schools as centers of excellence (COEs) and Centers of Development (CODs).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>High school</h4>
<p>The Ateneo de Manila High School is a Catholic preparatory school for male students.The principal is Fr. Raymund Benedict Q. Hizon, S.J.. His assumption of the post marks the first time a Jesuit has held the position since Mrs. <a>Carmela C. Oracion</a> was principal from 1998-2006.</p>
<p>The campus has two libraries, the Instructional Technology Center, the Tanghalang <a>Onofre Pagsanghan</a> (<a>Dulaang Sibol</a>), and a large athletics complex with one of the largest school-based covered courts facility in the country. In 2003, the High School opened a new building called the Center for Math, Science and Technology (commonly known as &quot;MST&quot;), which contains the school's science and computer laboratories and the faculty room for the Science and Math teachers.</p>
<p>The High School also divides its students into honors, semi-honors, and regular sections. The honors section is section A. The semi-honors classes are sections B, M, and N (except for 1st Year, which is section 1O instead of N). Sections B, M, and N emphasize Mathematics, Filipino language, and English, respectively, while Section A emphasizes all 6 subjects. Students who are in those classes will be classmates for their entire high school life provided that they do not fail a year, with the exception of Section M, where regular section students from 1st Year, (1C-1N) will have to take the Class 2M Test which will evaluate their skills and abilities in Filipino. Honors and Semi-Honors classes have additional plus points in exam scores and final marks in each subject, but of course, their curriculum is much more advanced and rigorous than that of the regular sections. Students from those sections can also take joint classes in English, Science, and Math with students from the honors and other semi-honors sections.</p>
<h4>Grade school</h4>
<p>The Ateneo de Manila Grade School is an elementary school for boys with a  population of around 4000 students. It has facilities and classrooms for students from the preparatory level to the seventh grade. It is an integral part of the Ateneo de Manila University governed by its own by-laws and administrative set-up. Its current headmaster is Fr. Norberto L. Bautista, SJ.</p>
<h4>Library system and Museums</h4>
<p>[[Image:new Rizal Library.jpg|thumb|thumb|The new [[Rizal Library]] building, completed in August and opened in November 2009]]</p>
<p>The Ateneo library system comprises several libraries housed in the Loyola Heights campus, and the Professional Schools campus. The university's main library is the <a>Rizal Library</a>, located in Loyola Heights. The <a>Ateneo Professional Schools Library</a>, on the other hand is housed in the Professional Schools building. Also included in the library system are the libraries of the Ateneo Grade School, High School, and those of the East Asian Pastoral Institute and the Loyola School of Theology which hold large collection of books in religious studies. Libraries of other Jesuit universities in Naga, Zamboanga, Davao and Cagayan de Oro are likewise linked to the Ateneo de Manila Libraries.</p>
<p>As of 2007, the Rizal Library's resources are estimated at more than 500,000 materials. The library also keeps rare Filipiniana materials, which include a permanent exhibit of Rizal memorabilia, the Trinidad Pardo de Tavera collection, the American Historical Collection, the Ateneo Library of Women's Writings (ALIWW) and other special collections and manuscripts by Filipino scholars, writers, and artists are likewise housed.</p>
<p>The Professional Schools Library holds one of the largest collection of materials in the fields of law, business and government in the Philippines.</p>
<h4>Auxiliary units and Research Centers</h4>

<h3>International programs</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Souvenir shop and cashiers at Xavier Hall</a> The Ateneo has international linkages with universities, institutions, and organizations, particularly in Asia, Australia, North and South America, and Europe. Through these cooperative efforts, the university hosts visiting faculty and research fellows from institutions abroad, and in turn, Ateneo faculty members also engage in teaching, research, and study in institutions abroad. International cooperation also includes active student exchange through Philippine immersion programs for a month or two for small groups of 15-18 students or full study programs wherein students from partner institutions abroad take regular courses. The Colegio de Manila was often referred to as the <em>Colegio de San Ignacio</em> or <em>Colegio M&#x00e1;ximo de San Ignacio</em> in historical textbooks. It was sometimes also called the <em>Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio</em>, a name which describes the Colegio de Manila and its extension residential college, the Colegio de San Jos&#x00e9;, established in 1601, and the precursor of the present San Jose Seminary</p>
<p>In 1621, the Colegio de Manila was authorized to confer university degrees in theology and arts by virtue of the privileges conferred by <a>Pope Gregory XV</a> on colleges of the Society of Jesus. In 1623, <a>Philip IV of Spain</a> confirmed the authorization, and the decree arrived in Manila in 1625. In 1732, <a>Philip V of Spain</a> founded two <em>regius</em> (royal) professorships in the Colegio, one in canon and another in civil law, making the school both a pontifical and a royal institution.  The institution was frequently referred to in contemporary documents as the <strong>Universidad de San Ignacio</strong>, the first royal and pontifical university in the Philippines and in Asia.  </p>
<p>However, by the mid-18th century, Catholic colonial powers, notably France, <a>Portugal</a>, and Spain, had grown hostile to the <a>Society of Jesus</a> because the <a>Jesuits</a> actively educated and empowered colonized people. The <a>Society</a> was particularly notorious for encouraging indigenous people to seek self-governance. Because of this, the colonial powers eventually expelled the Society, often quite brutally, from their realms. In 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the San Ignacio to Spanish civil authorities following their <a>suppression</a> and expulsion from Spain and the rest of the Spanish realm, including the Philippines. Under pressure from Catholic royalty, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus in 1773.</p>
<p>In 1952, <a>Fr. William F. Masterson S.J.</a>, moved most of the Ateneo units to its present Loyola Heights campus. This decision faced some opposition, with an American Jesuit supposedly saying that only the &quot;children of Tarzan&quot; would study in the new campus. But over the years, the Loyola Heights campus has become the center of a dynamic community. On 25 September 1969, Pacifico Ortiz, S.J., was installed as the first Filipino President of the Ateneo de Manila. A year earlier, the Ateneo co-founded the <a>Asian Institute of Management</a>.</p>
<p>Ateneans also played a vital role together with student organizations from other prominent colleges and universities as student activism rose in academe in the 1970s. Students faced university expulsion and violent government dispersal as they protested the dismissal of dissenting faculty and students, oppressive laws and price hikes, human rights violations, and other injustices. On 21 September 1972, Philippine President <a>Ferdinand Marcos</a> declared martial law. The university administration had great difficulty reconciling the promotion of social justice and keeping the university intact. They locked down on the more overt expressions of activism&#x2014;violence and miltancy&#x2014;and strived to maintain a semblance of normalcy as they sought to keep military men from being stationed on campus. The Ateneo college opened its doors to its first female students in that same year. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences moved to Loyola Heights in 1976, and the Padre Faura campus finally closed in 1977 as the Graduate School of Business and the Law School moved to H.V. de la Costa St. in Salcedo Village, Makati. That same year, the Ateneo, then the &#x2018;winningest&#x2019; school in men's basketball, left the <a>NCAA</a>, which it co-founded, due to violence plaguing the league. In 1996 the Ateneo relaunched the Ateneo Computer Technology Center as the Ateneo Information Technology Institute and established the Ateneo School of Government. In 1998, the Ateneo&#x2019;s Rockwell campus, which currently houses the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, the Ateneo Law School, and the Ateneo School of Government, was completed in Rockwell Center in Bel-Air, Makati. The Science Education Complex was completed in the Loyola Heights campus. In 2003, the Ateneo entered into its partnership with <a>Gawad Kalinga</a>, its first formal, university-wide social action program. In response to the typhoons and flooding that devastated most of the Philippine Island of Luzon in November 2004, the Ateneo launched Task Force Noah, its disaster response initiative, which has continued to contribute to disaster relief and rehabilitation efforts in areas that include Calatagan in Mindoro and Guinsaugon in Southern Leyte. The Ateneo earned the highest possible accreditation status, Level IV, the second Philippine university to earn this, from the <a>Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines</a> and the <a>Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities</a> (PAASCU). That same year, the Ateneo de Manila celebrated its 145th anniversary, and the 145th anniversary of the return of Jesuit education in the Philippines. It also launched the countdown to its sesquicentennial in 2009. </p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Manuel V. Pangilinan Center for Student Leadership</a> As typhoon relief efforts wound down in January 2005 the Ateneo, Gawad Kalinga, and other partners launched <a>Kalinga Luzon</a> (KL), a program dedicated to the long-term rehabilitation of typhoon-stricken communities in Luzon. The Ateneo also established more tie-ups and foreign linkages, as well as prepared efforts leading to the development of the Leong Center for Chinese Studies in the university.</p>
<p>In early 2006, members of the Ateneo de Manila University and affiliated Jesuit institutions were part of movements calling for action on the political issues that continue to rock Filipino society. The Ateneo de Manila University also intensified its social development efforts, launching Kalinga Leyte, a program for the long-term rehabilitation of Southern Leyte, with its GK partners. The Ateneo has also expanded the scope of its involvement with Gawad Kalinga and has begun to drive GK initiatives throughout Nueva Ecija, and in other provinces such as Cotobato and Quezon. The University also began ground-breaking for the development of several projects: the Ricardo Leong Hall, which houses several units of the Loyola Schools' School of Social Sciences and the Confucius Institute for Chinese Studies,  as well as the <a>Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health</a> facility in Ortigas, which welcomed its pioneering batch of professional students in June 2007. In December, the Ateneo also launched AGAP-Bikol in cooperation with other Jesuit-affiliated and civil society groups, in response to the devastation wrought by typhoons in the Bicol area. On 5 December 2007, University President Fr. <a>Bienvenido Nebres</a>, S.J., launched <em>Frontline Leadership</em>, a book project of the Ateneo School of Government (sponsored by German foundation <a>Konrad Adenauer Stiftung</a>), which narrates the performances of four former local officials, an unnamed female governor in the Visayas and one incumbent: Naga Mayor and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Jesse Robredo, former San Fernando, La Union Mayor Mary Jane Ortega, former Bulacan Gov. Josie de la Cruz, and former Surigao del Norte Gov. Robert Lyndon Barbers.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The University Dormitory</a> In October 2008, 66 faculty members from different departments, including members of the Theology Department, challenged the position of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) on the <a>Reproductive Health Bill</a> pending before the Philippine Congress University president <a>Fr. Bienvenido Nebres, S.J.</a> explained that their position was not the position of the university, but stressed that these faculty members had a right to express their views as individual Catholics and that there should be continuing efforts on the critical study and discussion of the bill among Church groups including the University and in civil society. </p>
<p>In November 2008, the University began work on building a new Rizal Library facility. In December, the a new set of university dormitories was inaugurated.  the Ateneo High School was granted Level III accreditation by the PAASCU, the highest level in the country.</p>
<h4>Sesquicentennial Celebration</h4>
<p>December 10, 2009 marked the 150th anniversary of the Ateneo de Manila University, as well as the 150th anniversary of the return of the Jesuits to the Philippines. The University began a countdown to the celebrations back in 2007.  The three years 2007, 2008, and 2009 were all given themes: Celebrating Excellence (2007), Deepening Spirituality (2008), and Building the Nation (2009). </p>
<p>Within this campus is the <a>Rizal Library</a>, the main university library. Also located here are numerous units and research centers affiliated with the Ateneo, such as the <a>Institute of Social Order</a>, Institute of <a>Philippine Culture</a>, <a>Institute on Church and Social Issues</a>, <a>Asian Public Intellectuals Fellowships</a>, the <a>Philippine Institute for Pure and Applied Chemistry</a>, the <a>Jesuit Communications Foundation</a>, the <a>Jesuit Basic Education Commission</a>, and others. Also situated here are the <a>East Asian Pastoral Institute</a>, <a>Loyola School of Theology</a>, and <a>San Jose Seminary</a>, all Jesuit formation institutions federated with the Ateneo de Manila University. The <a>Manila Observatory</a> is also located on campus. <a>Hadrian</a>&#x2019;s school drew its name from a <a>Greek temple</a> dedicated to <a>Athena</a>, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, was where &quot;poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Athen&#x00e6;um</em> is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is <em>academy,</em> referring to institutions of secondary learning. The Escuela Municipal de Manila actually became the Ateneo Municipal only after it began offering secondary education in 1865.   The Society of Jesus in the Philippines established several other schools, all named Ateneo, since 1865, and over the years, the name &quot;Ateneo&quot; has become recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines.</p>
<p>When the United States withdrew subsidy from Ateneo in 1901, Father Rector Jose Clos, S.J. dropped the word <em>municipal</em> from the school name, which then became Ateneo de Manila, a name it keeps to this day. Since its university charter was granted in 1959, the school has officially been called the Ateneo de Manila University.</p>
<p>The motto <em>Lux in Domino</em> first appeared as part of the Ateneo seal introduced by Father Rector Joaquin A&#x00f1;on, S.J. for the 1909 Golden Jubilee. It comes from the <a>letter of Paul to the Ephesians</a>, 5.8: &quot;For you were once in darkness, now you are light in the lord. Live as children of light, for light produces every kind of goodness, righteousness, and truth.&quot; This seal abandons the arms of Manila and instead adopts a design that uses mostly Jesuit and Ignatian symbols. This is the seal currently used by the Ateneo.</p>
<p>The seal is defined by two semi-circular ribbons. The crown (top) ribbon contains the school motto, &quot;Lux-in-Domino&quot;, while the base (bottom) ribbon contains the school name, &quot;Ateneo de Manila&quot;. These ribbons define a circular field on which rests the shield of O&#x00f1;az-Loyola: a combination of the arms of the paternal and maternal sides of the family of St. Ignatius. </p>
<p>In precise <a>heraldic</a> terms, the Shield of O&#x00f1;az-Loyola may be described as: &quot;Party per pale: Or, seven bendlets Gules; Argent, a two-eared pot hanging on a chain between two wolves rampant.&quot; In plain English, the shield is gold, and divided vertically. To the viewer's left is a field of gold with seven red bands. These are the arms of O&#x00f1;az, Ignatius' paternal family, which commemorates seven family heroes who fought with the Spaniards against 70,000 French, <a>Navarese</a>, and <a>Gascons</a>.</p>
<p>White and blue are also Ateneo&#x2019;s school colors, the colors of Mary. Red and gold are the colors of Spain, home of Ignatius and the Ateneo&#x2019;s Jesuit founders. Finally, these four color mirror those of the <a>Philippine flag</a>, marking the Ateneo&#x2019;s identity as a Filipino University.</p>
<p>In official Jesuit documents (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>Catalogus Provinciae Philippinae Societatis Jesu</em>), the Ateneo de Manila is also referred to as the &quot;University of the Immaculate Conception BVM&quot;, the Immaculate Conception being the official patron of the University. This is why the eighth of December, the Solemn Feast of the Immaculate Conception is always a school holiday although the University community honors her liturgically a few days before or after the feastday itself.</p>
<h4>&quot;A Song for Mary&quot;</h4>
<p>Before the Ateneo de Manila moved to Loyola Heights, the school anthem was &quot;Hail Ateneo, Hail,&quot; a marching tune. When the Ateneo moved from Padre Faura to Loyola Heights in the 1950s, the school adopted &quot;A Song for Mary&quot; as its graduation hymn. Fr. James Reuter wrote the lyrics, and Ateneo band moderator Colonel Jose Campa&#x00f1;a adapted the melody from  <a>Calixa Lavall&#x00e9;e</a>'s patriotic hymn &quot;<a>O Canada</a>,&quot; composed in 1880, which eventually became Canada's national anthem in 1980. Over the decades, the graduation hymn eventually supplanted &quot;Hail Ateneo, Hail&quot; and is now widely considered the Ateneo de Manila's alma mater song. Marian blue is traditionally ultramarine, a deep ocean blue tincture derived from lapis lazuli, which historically has been used to color the vestments of Mary in paintings. But since Mary is honored as Stella Maris (Star of the Sea) and Queen of Heaven, various shades of blue, such as royal blue and sky blue are acceptable shades of Marian blue as well. The idea caught on in the Philippines. By the 1930s, the Ateneo adopted Blue Eagle as a symbol, and had a live eagle accompany the basketball team.</p>
<h3>Cheering tradition</h3>
<p>The Ateneo de Manila was successful in athletics even before the NCAA began. To help cheer the Ateneo squad on, the Jesuits decided that the Ateneo ought to have some sort of organization in its cheering.
