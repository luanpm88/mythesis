<p>The <strong>University of Oklahoma</strong> (abbreviated <strong>OU</strong>) is a <a>coeducational</a> <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Norman, Oklahoma</a>. Founded in 1890, it existed in <a>Oklahoma Territory</a> near <a>Indian Territory</a> for 17 years before the two became the state of Oklahoma.  the university had 29,931 students enrolled, most located at its main campus in <a>Norman</a>. Employing nearly 3,000 faculty members, the school offers 152 <a>baccalaureate</a> programs, 160 <a>master's</a> programs, 75 <a>doctorate</a> programs, and 20 majors at the first professional level. <a>David Boren</a>, a former <a>U.S. Senator</a> and <a>Oklahoma Governor</a>, has served as President of the University of Oklahoma since 1994.</p>
<p>In 2007 <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> named the University of Oklahoma one of its &quot;Best Value&quot; colleges. The school is ranked first per capita among public universities in enrollment of <a>National Merit Scholar</a>s and among the top five in the graduation of <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>. and 2008, while the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classifies it as a <a>research university</a> with &quot;high research activity.&quot; Located on its Norman campus are two prominent museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, specializing in French <a>Impressionism</a> and <a>Native American</a> artwork, and the <a>Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a>, specializing in the natural history of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The school, well-known for its athletic programs, has won 7 <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> National Football Championships. Its baseball team has won 2 <a>NCAA</a> national championships and the women's softball team won the national championship in 2000.  The <a>gymnastic</a>s teams have won four national championships since 2002 and its <a>football</a> program has the best winning percentage of any <a>Division I</a>-FBS team since the introduction of the <a>AP Poll</a> in 1936, playing in four <a>BCS national championship games</a> since the inception of the <a>BCS</a> system in 1998.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1889 the <a>Governor of Oklahoma Territory</a>, <a>George Washington Steele</a>, urged the <a>Oklahoma Territorial</a> legislature to &quot;create <a>public school</a> systems and universities of higher education&quot;. In December 1890, the Legislature established three universities: the state university in Norman, the agricultural and mechanical college in <a>Stillwater</a> (later renamed <a>Oklahoma State University</a>) and a <a>normal school</a> in <a>Edmond</a> (later renamed <a>University of Central Oklahoma</a>). Oklahoma's admission into the union in 1907 led to the renaming of the Norman Territorial University as the University of Oklahoma. Norman residents donated  of land for the university  south of the Norman railroad depot. The university's first president ordered the planting of numerous trees before the construction of the first campus building because he &quot;could not visualize a treeless university seat.&quot; Landscaping remains important to the university.</p>
<p>The university's first president, <a>David Ross Boyd</a>, arrived in Norman in August 1892 and the first students enrolled that year. The university established a School of Pharmacy in 1893 because of high demand for pharmacists in the territory. Three years later, the university awarded its first degree to a pharmaceutical chemist.  The &quot;Rock Building&quot; in downtown Norman held the initial classes until the university's first building opened on September 6, 1893.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Donald W. Reynolds Center for the Performing Arts, formerly Holmberg Hall, exemplifies the school's architectural style.</a></p>
<p>On January 6, 1903, the university's only building burned down and destroyed many records of the early university. Construction began immediately on a new building, as several other towns hoped to capitalize by convincing the university to move. President Boyd and the faculty were not dismayed by the loss. Mathematics professor Frederick Elder said, &quot;What do you need to keep classes going? Two yards of blackboard and a box of chalk.&quot; As a response to the fire, English professor <a>Vernon Louis Parrington</a> created a plan for the future development of the campus. Most of the plan was never implemented, but Parrington's suggestion for the campus core formed the basis for the North Oval. The North and South Ovals are now distinctive features of the campus.</p>
<p>The campus has a distinctive architecture, with buildings designed in a unique Cherokee Gothic style. The style has many features of the Gothic era but has also mixed the designs of local Native American tribes from Oklahoma. This term was coined by the renowned American architect Frank Lloyd Wright when he visited the campus.  The University has built over a dozen buildings in the Cherokee Gothic style.</p>
<p> In 1907, Oklahoma entered statehood, fostering changes in the political atmosphere of the state. Up until this point, Oklahoma's <a>Republican</a> tendencies changed with the election of Oklahoma's first <a>governor</a>, the <a>Democratic</a> <a>Charles N. Haskell</a>. Since the inception of the university, different groups on campus were divided by religion.  Early in the university's existence, many professors were <a>Presbyterian</a>, as was Boyd. Under pressure, Boyd eventually hired several <a>Baptists</a> and Southern <a>Methodist</a>s. The Presbyterians and Baptists got along but the Southern Methodists conflicted with the administration. Two notable Methodists, Rev. Nathaniel Lee Linebaugh and Professor Ernest Taylor Bynum, were critics of Boyd and activists in Haskell's election campaign. When Haskell took office, he fired many of the Republicans at the university, including President Boyd.</p>
<p>The campus expanded over the next several decades.  By 1932, the university encompassed . Development of South Oval allowed for the southern expansion of the campus. The University built a new library on the oval's north end in 1936. Then President Bizzell was able to get the Oklahoma legislature to approve $500,000 for the new library up from their original offer of $200,000. This allowed for an even greater collection of research materials for students and faculty. </p>
<p>Many infrastructure changes have occurred at the university. The southern portion of south campus in the vicinity of Constitution Avenue, still known to long-time Norman residents as 'South Base', was originally built as an annex to Naval Air Station Norman. It contained mostly single-story frame buildings used for classrooms and military housing.  By the late 1980s, most were severely deteriorated and were demolished in the 1990s to make room for redevelopment. The Jimmie Austin University of Oklahoma Golf Course was built as a U.S. Navy recreational facility. A large earthen mound east of <a>Interstate 35</a> and north of Robinson Street, colloquially known as 'Mount Williams', was used as a gunnery (the mound has since been removed to make way for a commercial development). In the post-World War II <a>demobilization</a>, the university received the installation.  Naval aviator's wings displayed at the entrance to the terminal commemorates this airfield's Naval past.</p>
<p>After the war, enrollment surged. By 1965, enrollment had risen over 450% to 17,268, causing housing shortages. These apartments are now Kraettli Apartments. [[Image:Bizzell Library 4-15-2006 11-20-33 AM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bizzell Memorial Library|Bizzell Library]] sits at the heart of the university's Norman campus.]]</p>
<p>In 1943 <a>George Lynn Cross</a> took over as president of the University, two years after the U.S. entered World War II. He served until 1968, 25 years later, becoming the longest-serving president in history of the university.  Five presidents served in the next 25 years. In 1994, the university hired a president who has stayed longer.</p>
<p>The university had policies of racial discrimination and segregation which were challenged and overturned in court cases.  The <a>Bizzell Memorial Library</a> has been designated a U.S. <a>National Historic Landmark</a> in commemoration of the cases of David McLaurin, a black man who was denied admission to graduate school in 1948.  It was then state law that no school should serve both white and black students, but there were few or no separate graduate programs available for blacks.  A court case effectively forced the Board of Regents to vote to admit McLaurin, but he was directed to study in a separated area within the law library and to be allowed to lunch only in a segregated area as well.  The National Association for Advancement of Colored People brought the case to the U.S. Supreme court in <a>McLaurin vs. Oklahoma State Board of Regents</a>.  In 1950, the court overturned the university's policy for segregation at the graduate school level.  The case was an important precedent for the more famous and sweeping 1954 case of <a>Brown v. Board of Education</a> which disallowed &quot;separate but equal&quot; policy at all school levels.</p>
<p>Since <a>David Boren</a> became Oklahoma's president in 1994, the University of Oklahoma system has had an increase in new developments throughout including: the purchase of  for OU-Tulsa, the new Gaylord Hall, Price Hall, the ExxonMobil Lawrence G. Rawl Engineering Practice Facility, Devon Energy Hall, the Wagner Student Academic Services Center, the Research and Medical Clinic, the expansions of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, and the <a>National Weather Center</a>.</p>
<h2>Recognition</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Oklahoma Mesonet, a state-of-the-art network of <a>environmental monitoring</a> stations on which OU works in partnership with <a>Oklahoma State University</a> partnership, won a special award from the <a>American Meteorological Society</a> (AMS) - the leading <a>profession</a>al society in the United States for those working in the atmospheric and related sciences.</li>
  <li>In 2001, OK-FIRST was recognized as one of the nation's five most innovative government programs by <a>Harvard University</a>'s <a>John F. Kennedy School of Government</a> and their <a>Innovation</a>s in <a>American Government</a> program.   <a>thumb|Gaylord Hall, home of the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, finished construction in 2004.</a></p>
<p>In 2009, the University of Oklahoma was ranked among the top 50 <a>public universities</a> in the nation by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>. The 2010 U.S. News and World Report ranked OU 111th among &quot;National Universities,&quot; and has categorized it as &quot;more selective.&quot; Students come from all 50 <a>U.S. state</a>s and over 100 countries. 32% of the 2006 freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school class. Ethnic <a>minority groups</a> represent over 25% of newly-enrolled undergraduates and 27% of all students. In addition, the university has an enrollment of over 700 <a>National Merit</a> Scholars, making it first per capita among public universities. In a survey of the top 500 academic institutions in the world by the <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2006, Oklahoma ranked 301st. They were tied with 99 other schools, including Big 12 schools such as <a>Texas Tech University</a> and <a>Kansas State University</a>.  <a>University of Colorado</a> was the highest Big 12 school, being ranked number 34. However, due to stricter enrollment policies in recent years, average scores for incoming students are on the rise. The average <a>ACT</a> score for a first-time student in 2006 was a 25.6 while in 1999, it was 24.5.</p>
<p>In addition to 152 majors to choose from, the University of Oklahoma also has a nationally recognized <a>Honors College</a>. Every student from any major can apply to the college; if accepted the student is eligible to take honors classes and graduate <a>cum laude</a>. In order to graduate with honors, the student must complete 18 credit hours of honors classes. Transfer students are able to transfer up to nine credit hours of honor classes from a different university.</p>

<h3>Norman campus</h3>
<p>As of the Fall of 2007, the Norman campus had 19,852 <a>undergraduate students</a> and 6,367 <a>postgraduate students</a>.  <a>thumb|left|Price Hall, an addition to the Michael F. Price College of Business, finished construction in 2005.</a></p>
<p>The largest school, <a>The College of Arts &amp; Sciences</a>,  enrolls 37% of the OU-Norman students. The College of Arts &amp; Sciences offers several programs, which include internships and most notably a joint archeological program with <a>Saint Anselm College</a> of Manchester, New Hampshire, in <a>Orvieto</a>, <a>Italy</a>. The next largest school, <a>The Price College of Business</a> enrolls 14%. Other large colleges on the Norman campus include the <a>College of Engineering</a> with 11% and the <a>College of Education</a>, <a>Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, and College of Liberal Studies, each with approximately 6% of the student body. Smaller schools include the Colleges of <a>Architecture</a> and <a>Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences</a>, <a>Earth and Energy</a>, the <a>Weitzenhoffer Family College of Fine Arts</a>, and the <a>College of Law</a>. New students do not have to declare a <a>major</a> (a concentrated course of study) immediately and are not required to declare a major until their Junior year. If they are undecided in their major, they are considered a part of the <a>University College</a>, comprising approximately 11% of the student body. Many Pre-Health majors choose this option until they are able to apply for the medical program of their choice. depicts David Ross Boyd, the school's first president.]] --&gt; The Norman campus is divided into three sections: north campus, main campus, and south campus. All three campuses are connected by a bus service funded by student fees which allows students to park at <a>Lloyd Noble Center</a> and provides 5-10 minute service to the main and south campuses. Other regular Norman bus routes provide service to north campus as well as the main campus. The main and south campus are contiguous while the north campus is located about two miles north of the main campus.</p>
<h4>Main campus</h4>
<p>The main campus is bordered by Boyd Street on the north, Timberdell Road on the south, Chautauqua Avenue on the west, and Jenkins Avenue on the east. The Norman campus is centered around two large &quot;ovals.&quot;  The Parrington Oval (or North Oval as it is more commonly called) is anchored on the south by Evans Hall, the main administrative building. This building highlights the &quot;<a>Cherokee</a> <a>Gothic</a>&quot; style of architecture locally derived from the Collegiate Gothic style, the style that dominates and defines the older buildings on the OU campus. and the Catlett Music Center. The Van Vleet Oval (or South Oval) is anchored on the north by the <a>Bizzell Memorial Library</a> and flanked by academic buildings. When class is in session, the South Oval is often inundated with students going to and from class. Elm Avenue bounds the western edge of the academic portion of OU, with a few exceptions. Lying between Elm Avenue and Chautauqua Avenue are mostly <a>fraternity and sorority</a> houses.</p>
<p>On the east side of the central part of campus lies <a>Gaylord Family - Oklahoma Memorial Stadium</a>, just north of Lindsey Street on Jenkins Avenue. Immediately adjacent to the stadium is the Barry Switzer Center, a museum highlighting the historical success of Oklahoma athletics, as well as a comprehensive training facility for Oklahoma athletes. North of the stadium is the McCasland Field House, the former home of Oklahoma Basketball and the current home of Oklahoma's wrestling, volleyball and gymnastics programs. Across Jenkins Avenue are the athletic dorms and statues honoring Oklahoma's past five <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winners. Other statues on campus include several honoring the <a>Native Americans</a> who defined so much of Oklahoma's history and a new memorial statue on the north side of Oklahoma Memorial Stadium honoring OU students, faculty, and staff that have died while serving in the <a>armed forces</a>.</p>
<p>The portion of OU's main campus south of Lindsey Street includes three Colleges, University housing, student activity and fitness facilities, and the Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education. The Joe C. and Carole Kerr McClendon Honors College is located in David L. Boren Hall, which serves as an Academic Arts Community where residential rooms, faculty offices, classrooms, a computer center and library are all available in the same building. Other residence halls include the twelve-story Adams, Couch and Walker Centers, as well as Cate Center, made up of three- and four-story buildings.  Adjacent to the residence facilities are the Huston Huffman Fitness Center, Henderson-Tolson Cultural Center and the Jim Thorpe Multicultural Center. The Murray Case Sells Swim Complex is also nearby, providing indoor and outdoor swimming opportunities for the OU community. The Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education (OCCE) is one of eleven W. K. Kellogg Foundation-funded centers in the United States and Brittain. It is home to OU Outreach, which consists of the College of Continuing Education and the College of Liberal Studies, and includes a conference center able to host events of up to 1500 participants.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Directly north of the main campus on Boyd Street is Campus Corner, a popular commercial area. There are several restaurants, bars, and small shops that cater to the student body and the Norman population at large.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma administration prides itself on the aesthetic appeal of the campus. All three campuses (Norman, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa) have beautifully landscaped gardens. Trees were planted on the OU campus before the first building was ever built.</p>
<h4>North campus</h4>
<p>On the far north side of Norman is the OU Research Park, which includes <a>University of Oklahoma Max Westheimer Airport</a> (<a>ICAO</a>: KOUN), the <a>Radar Operations Center</a>, the old <a>National Severe Storms Laboratory</a> facility, the OU OKDHS Training and Research Center, the OU ITS Lab, and Merrick Computer and Technology Center. This part of campus is frequented by students studying aviation. The Aviation Accreditation Board has accredited the College of Aviation at North Base - one of the most prestigious establishments of its type in the United States - as one of only 28 accredited colleges in the world.</p>
<h4>South campus</h4>
<p>[[Image:National Weather Center 6-20-2006 3-48-27 PM.jpg|thumb|The [[National Weather Center]] calls the university's south campus home.]] South of student housing is Timberdell Road, the approximate southern boundary of the University. South of this road are University-owned apartments and athletic complexes. Also on the south side of Timberdell Road is the <a>College of Law</a> building which was expanded in 2002 by the addition of a larger law library and courtroom. There are additional athletic complexes in this area, including <a>L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park</a>, the OU Softball Field, and <a>Lloyd Noble Center</a> (the basketball arena). </p>
<p>[[Image:OUPRIME1.png|100px|thumb|left|[[OU-PRIME]] radar during construction on the Research Campus]]</p>
<p>OU owns the wooded area just south of Highway 9 between Chautauqua and Jenkins. This area is called Oliver&#x2019;s Woods. Ecology classes take field trips to Oliver&#x2019;s Woods frequently. They can use the area to study Ecological patterns including tree growth and pH in the ground. Visible patterns of plant dispersion can be studied in Oliver&#x2019;s Woods as well, including uniform, random, and clumped patterns. The area has a trail for people to follow and a creek running through the lower elevated area.</p>
<h4>Research Campus</h4>
<p>While this area has traditionally lacked academic buildings, the pressure of expansion in the northern part of campus led  to the construction of new academic buildings - such as the <a>National Weather Center</a> and Stephenson Research and Technology Center - on the south end of campus. This area is now termed <a>The University of Oklahoma&#x2019;s Research Campus</a>, which &quot;brings academic, public and private sector organizations together in a mutually beneficial collaborative environment.&quot; In 2004, global weather information provider <a>WeatherNews</a> opened its U.S. Operations Center in One Partners Place, located in the research campus one block away from the new NWC building. The southern boundary of the research campus is <a>State Highway 9</a>.  Also located on the Research Campus is the state-of-the-art <a>weather radar</a> called <a>OU-PRIME</a>  [<a>http://arrc.ou.edu/ouprime/</a>] for Polarimetric Radar for Innovations in Meteorology and Engineering.  This radar facility is operated by OU's <a>Atmospheric Radar Research Center</a>.  The new Life Sciences Research Center is almost complete and is soon to open.  In addition to this, there are now several other buildings located on the research campus named One Partners Place, Two Partners Place, Three Partners Place along with a proposed Four Partners Place.  Housed within these buildings are the Center for Spatial Analysis, RiskMetrics and the Center for Applied Social Research amongst several others.  Plans for Four Partner Place call for it to eventually house a research division for the Nanjing Automobile Group.</p>

<h3>Health Sciences Center</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <a>University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center</a>'s main campus is located at the Oklahoma Health Center in Oklahoma City, while a secondary Health Sciences campus is in <a>Tulsa</a>. About 3,500 students enroll in one of the seven colleges at the Health Center.  The distribution of students in each of these colleges is more uniform than that of the main campus.</p>
<p>The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (<a>OUHSC</a>), established in the early 20th century, is OU's presence in Oklahoma City. OUHSC is one of only four academic health centers in the nation with seven professional colleges. The nineteen buildings that make up the OUHSC campus occupies a fifteen block area in Oklahoma City near the <a>Oklahoma State Capitol</a>. Surrounding these buildings are an additional twenty health-related buildings some of which are owned by the University of Oklahoma.  With approximately 600 students and 600 residents and fellows training in specialties and subspecialties of medicine, the <a>College of Medicine</a> is the largest component of the Health Sciences Center.  The major clinical facilities on campus are the OU Medical Center hospital complex and they include The Children's Hospital, the OU Physicians clinics, and the Oklahoma City <a>Veterans Administration Medical Center</a>. The Oklahoma Health Center at large has large biomedical research facilities operated by the University joined on campus by a growing biomedical and pharmaceutical research corporations developed by the Presbyterian Health Foundation,  dedicated to biotechnology, research, and new scientific ventures.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The University of Oklahoma campus in Tulsa houses the new Research and Medical Clinic.</a> Established in 1972 as a branch of the main Health Sciences Center campus in Oklahoma City, the <a>OU School of Community Medicine</a>, formerly the College of Medicine&ndash;Tulsa, has enabled the University to use hospital training facilities in Tulsa to establish medical residencies and provide for expanded <a>health care</a> capabilities in the state. Under this program, selected third- and fourth-year students receive their clinical training in hospitals in the Tulsa community. Between 1972 and 1999, OU's presence in Tulsa had grown but scattered. In 1999, a  site formerly owned by <a>BP Amoco</a> was sold to the University for $24 million (even though the property was appraised at $48 million). The site already featured a  building with office, labs, and classrooms. The university purchased this property with the help of a $10 million gift from the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation. The existing building was renamed the <em>Schusterman Center</em>.  In 2003, Tulsa voters approved the <a>Vision 2025</a> plan for capital improvements to the Tulsa metro area. Included in this plan was $30 million for a new Research and Medical Clinic near the existing Schusterman Center. Construction on the new building was completed in June 2007.</p>
<h2>Museums and libraries</h2>
<p>[[Image:FredJonesMuseumofArt.jpg|thumb|[[Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art]] on the University of Oklahoma campus has a different architectural style than the rest of the campus.]] [[Image:People of Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|People of [[Oklahoma]] exhibit in the <a>Sam Noble Museum of Natural History</a>.]] The university has two prominent museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and the <a>Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a>. The Museum of Art was founded in 1936 and originally headed by Oscar Jacobson, the director of the School of Art at the time. The museum opened with over 2,500 items on display and was originally located on campus in Jacobson Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Fred Jones of <a>Oklahoma City</a> donated money for a permanent building in 1971 and the building was named in honor of their son who died in a plane crash during his senior year at the University of Oklahoma. Since then, the museum has acquired many renowned works of Native American art and, in 2000, received the Weitzenhoffer Collection of French <a>Impressionism</a> which includes works by <a>Degas</a>, <a>Gauguin</a>, <a>Monet</a>, <a>Pissarro</a>, <a>Renoir</a>, <a>Toulouse-Lautrec</a>, <a>Van Gogh</a>, and <a>Vuillard</a>. Today, the museum has over 65,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;feet (6,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) filled with over 8,000 items from a wide array of <a>time periods</a> and <a>movements</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a>, located south of the main campus and directly southwest of the law building, specializes in the history of the people and animals that have inhabited Oklahoma over the last 300 million years. Since its founding in 1899, the museum has acquired over 5,000,000 objects. In 2000, a new building was opened to house the ever expanding museum. The new building offered nearly 200,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;feet (18,600&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) of space to display the many exhibits the museum has to offer.</p>
<p>The University of Oklahoma Library system is headquartered in <a>Bizzell Memorial Library</a> and is largest research library in Oklahoma, contains over 4.7 million volumes and is ranked 27th out of 113 research libraries in North America in volumes held. It contains more than 1.6 million <a>photographs</a>, subscriptions to over 31,000 <a>periodicals</a>, over 1.5 million <a>maps</a>, government documents dating back to 1893, and over 50 <a>incunabula</a>. including hand-noted works by <a>Galileo Galilei</a>), the Bizzell Bible Collection, and the Western History Collection.</p>
<p>The School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS), the only <a>American Library Association</a>-accredited program in Oklahoma, offers two graduate degrees (Master of Library and Information Studies and Master of Science in Knowledge Management) and one undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Arts in Information Studies).  The impact of OU and SLIS on the history of libraries in Oklahoma is shown in the recent list of 100 Oklahoma Library Legends as produced by the Oklahoma Library Association. Two current faculty, one faculty emeriti, and numerous others associated with either the OU libraries or SLIS comprise nearly 10% of the list's members.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>The main governing arm of the student body, the University of Oklahoma Student Association (UOSA), comprises four branches: an Executive Branch, a Legislative Branch, a Judicial Branch, and a Programming Branch, which was first established in 1969. The student government, as well as all organizations, has offices located in the Conoco Student Leadership Center located in the student union. The student activity fee accumulated is divided into various amounts to be disbursed by a committee made up of the student president, the chair of the undergraduate student congress, the chair of the graduate student senate, and the vice president of student affairs. The student government's current budget is just over $700,000, which is used to funds student organization, as well as to pays staff assistants, bills on student government property, and other debts.</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>The UOSA is divided into four equal governing branches: the executive, legislative, judicial, and programming.</p>
<p>-The Executive Branch is composed of the President and Vice President along with their cabinet of various departments filled with directors, coordinators, and officers. The President and Vice President are elected together on a ticket during the spring general elections. President nominates his or her cabinet and other executive officials to the legislature to be confirmed through the process of advise and consent. The members of the Executive Branch act as the advocates for students by meeting with administration, promoting resolutions passed by the legislature, and ensuring that all laws of the UOSA are faithfully executed.</p>
<p>-The Legislative Branch is composed of two houses:  the Undergraduate Student Congress and the Graduate Student Senate. The Representatives of the Undergraduate Student Congress and Senators of the Graduate Student Senate are elected according to their academic district and college. Both houses elect internally their own leadership as well as consider legislation on a wide variety of topics concerning students at OU. In addition, the legislature considers resolutions concerning issues as diverse as gender neutral housing, smoking bans, safety concerns, sidewalks, parking, and recreational facilities. This branch considers these issues through the use of various committees.</p>
<p>-The Judicial Branch is composed of one high court and lower courts. The high court is the UOSA Student Superior Court, which acts as a <a>Court of Last Resort</a>; its jurisdiction includes all cases that affect the UOSA constitution, election fraud, or any other appeal from a lower court. UOSA currently has one lower court, the Parking Appeals Board, which reviews appeals made over various parking citations.</p>
<p>-The Campus Activities Council (CAC) constitutes the Programing Branch of UOSA. It is led by a Chair, who is elected each spring in a campus wide election. CAC is responsible for organizing many on campus events like Howdy Week (a welcoming of new students to campus in the fall), Big Red Rally (a pep rally before the start of the football season), Homecoming, University Sing,  Family Weekend, Dance Marathon, and College Bowl. The Campus Activities Council also has a Concert Series, Film Series, and a Speaker&#x2019;s Bureau that provide funding for visiting speakers, films, and bands. Originally, CAC was the programming arm of the UOSA under the Executive Branch. In 2002, the student body voted and passed a constitutional amendment to make the Campus Activities Council its own branch.</p>
<p>The student government also has an independent student legal office called the General Counsel. The UOSA General Counsel, chief legal counsel for the UOSA, provides legal advice, handles issues regarding academic misconduct, and approves new student organization constitutions.</p>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Walker, Boren, Couch and Adams dorm buildings make up four of the school's residential halls.</a> Oklahoma requires, with few exceptions, that all freshmen live in one of the four <a>residence halls</a>. Three of these building are towers (12 stories each): Adams Center, Walker Center, and Couch Center; the other is <a>quad</a> Cate Center. The Academic Arts Community, more commonly referred to as Cate 5 or Honors, is located directly above the honors college, David L. Boren Hall. Although it is commonly believed that this dorm caters only to honors students, a large proportion of non-honors students comprise the community.  The three towers are all located around each other with the Couch Cafeteria completing the residence community. Couch Cafeteria is composed of several different themed restaurants that serves a wide variety of food each day. Located in between Adams and Walker Centers is the Walker/Adams Mall, a field roughly the size of a football field. This area includes a basketball court and an open grass area that hosts musical events and other student-related activities. As of Fall 2007, over 3,900 students lived in one of these residence halls. Each residence hall has its own RSA (Resident Student Association) office, as well as its own computer lab and laundry facilities. By 2010, all residential halls, with the exception of Cate, will be completely renovated and upgraded. As of the Spring 2009 semester, the south-east wing of Walker Center is under renovation.</p>
<p>The university owns several apartment complexes around the campus. Some of these apartments were old and dilapidated, and the university has taken the strides to resolve this issue. Two brand new complexes owned by the university opened in recent years; OU Traditions Square East in 2005 and OU Traditions Square West in 2006. </p>
<p>Due to a low <a>cost of living</a> in Oklahoma, many students find it financially viable to live off campus in either apartments or houses. Over the last several years, Norman has seen a boom in apartment development. Since 2002, four new apartment or condominium complexes (not including the OU-owned properties) have been built in addition to a booming housing market that is resulting in Norman spreading further east. Many students commute from nearby <a>Moore</a> and <a>Oklahoma City</a>.</p>

<p>The student union provides a place for students to relax, sleep, study, watch <a>television</a>, or socialize. The Union Programming Board provides diverse activities and programs in the union such as movies, bands, dances, give-aways, or other activities. The Union Programming Board, also known as UPB, has a slogan of &quot;Always Something&quot; because there is always something happening in the Oklahoma Memorial Union. <a>Intramural sports</a> are a popular activity on campus with over 35 different sports available. A large intramural field, where many outdoor events take place, is located just one block east of the dorms.</p>

Students wishing to enter the band go through a rigorous audition process. The band plays at every home football game. A smaller &quot;pep-band,&quot; which usually consists of 100 members, travels to every away football game.  The full band makes trips to the AT&amp;T <a>Red River Rivalry</a> game against <a>The University of Texas</a>, <a>Big 12 Championship Game</a>, <a>bowl game</a>s and other games of importance. Members of the band are also present for many student events.  It was awarded the <a>Sudler Trophy</a> in 1987.

<h2>Athletics</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|University of Oklahoma Boomer, Sooners Mascot</a> The school's sports teams are called the <a>Sooners</a>, a nickname given to early settlers during the <a>land run</a> who sneaked into the offered territory and staked claims before they were officially allowed to. They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I-Bowl Subdivision and in the South Division of the <a>Big 12 Conference</a>. The school sponsors nine sports for both men and women. The University has won 18 team <a>NCAA</a> National Championships Many Pro Football Hall of Famers, including Lee Roy Selmon, <a>Troy Aikman</a>, and Ken Sitton also attended the University of Oklahoma. OU was also the only school to participate in both the football and basketball national championships in the same year (<a>1988</a>), until the 2006 season, when <a>Ohio State</a> and the <a>University of Florida</a> were both in each, with Florida winning both games. Oklahoma also currently holds the record for the longest winning streak in NCAA Division I history when they won 47 consecutive games between 1953 to 1957. In reference to the team's success and popularity as a symbol of state pride, <a>George Lynn Cross</a>, OU's president from 1943 to 1968, once told the Oklahoma State Senate, &quot;I want a university the football team can be proud of.&quot;</p>
<p><a>thumb|300px|Several main athletic facilities are grouped together at the Norman campus.</a> The men's gymnastics team has won several national championships including championships in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2008. In addition, Oklahoma has produced five Nissen Emery Award winners, more than any other school and the only school with back-to-back honorees. The <a>softball</a> team won a national championship in 2000 and the baseball team a national championship in 1994. On May 10, 2007 the University announced the addition of women's rowing to the intercollegiate athletics program. A rowing facility will be built on the <a>Oklahoma River</a> near downtown <a>Oklahoma City</a>. This is the first sport added since women's soccer was added in 1996. According to OU President David Boren, &quot;It is our patriotic duty as Americans to help our country achieve energy independence and to be sound stewards of the environment.&quot; The school plans to purchase its energy from the OU Spirit Wind Farm, which is scheduled for construction near Woodward in late 2009. The new source of energy is projected to cost the university an additional $5 million per year.</p>
<h2>Building renovations and new construction</h2>
<p>OU started renovation projects to certain buildings on campus - including Gould Hall and Collings Hallin - in the fall of 2008. The College of Architecture wanted to change the old design of the building into something new, more suitable but yet stands out from the rest. The Gould Hall renovation project is still in its construction stage as it should be expected to be finished by January 2011. One of the main purposes of this renovation was not to just make Gould Hall bigger and newer but to unite all five divisions of the College of Architecture under one roof for the first time.</p>
<p>The Anne and Henry Zarrow School of Social Work is currently being constructed on the Norman campus and will offer state of the art facilities for the training of undergraduate and graduate social wokers.  The 12 million dollar building is named for the Zarrow family, a philanthropic couple from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The Zarrow's donated 5 million dollars as the keystone donors for the new building with the remaining funds coming from a bequest of Ruth I. Knee, a graduate of the program, and a portion of the states federal stimulus funds. The building is slated for occupancy during summer of 2011 and is dedicated solely to the School of Social Work, a school which has trained social workers for nearly 100 years.</p>
