<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 1694 <a>Constantin Br&#x00e2;ncoveanu</a>, ruler of <a>Wallachia</a>, had founded the Princely Academy of Saint Sava in <a>Bucharest</a> with lectures delivered in Greek. In 1776, <a>Alexander Ypsilantis</a>, ruler of Wallachia, reformed the curriculum of the Saint Sava Academy, where courses of French, Italian and Latin were now taught. In 1859, the Faculty of Law was created. In 1857, <a>Carol Davila</a> created the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy. In 1857, the foundation stone of the University Palace in Bucharest was laid. <a>thumb|300px|The original 1857 project of the University main building, by Alexandru Or&#x0103;scu</a> On July 4/16 1864 Prince Alexander John Cuza created the University of Bucharest, bringing together the Faculties of Law, Sciences and Letters as one single body. In the following years, new faculties were created:  1884 &#x2013; the Faculty of Theology; 1906 &#x2013; the Institute of Geology; 1913 &#x2013; the Academic Institute for Electrotechnology; 1921 &#x2013; the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine; 1923 &#x2013; the Faculty of Pharmacy, 1924 &#x2013; the <a>Mina Minovici</a> Institute of Forensic Medicine.</p>
<p>In 1956, student leaders, mainly from this university, planned a peaceful protest against Romania's <a>Communist regime</a> but were forcibly prevented from carrying it out. (See <a>Bucharest student movement of 1956</a>) [[Image:UnivBucharestLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Central University Library of Bucharest|Central University Library]], housed in a rich <a>neo-baroque</a> structure]] </p>
<h3>Post-1989 history</h3>
<p>The area around the old University building (the <a>University Square</a>), adjacent to the <a>C. A. Rosetti</a>, Roman, <a>Kog&#x0103;lniceanu</a>, and Union Squares was the scene of many riots, protests and clashes with the <a>security forces</a> during the <a>Romanian Revolution of 1989</a>. During the months of April-June 1990, the University of Bucharest was the centre of <a>anti-communist</a> protests. </p>
<p>In 1996, <a>Emil Constantinescu</a>, the then <a>rector</a> of the University of Bucharest, was elected <a>President of Romania</a>, after defeating <a>Ion Iliescu</a> in <a>national presidential elections</a>.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The University of Bucharest contributes through research and higher-education to the development and use of knowledge, at both national and international level. The University of Bucharest is a university with academic integrity and concern for critical thinking, a significant point of reference in society.</p>
<h3>Position in National and International Ranking Lists</h3>
<p>The Times Higher Education Supplement classification ranked the University of Bucharest among the first 600 in the world in the last three years. The classification, according to fields of interest, is as follows: Arts and Humanities &#x2013; 277; Social Sciences &#x2013; 330; Engineering and Information Technology (IT) &#x2013; 336; Life Sciences and Biomedicine &#x2013; 427; and Natural Sciences &#x2013; 447.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, the University of Bucharest occupied the 1st or 2nd place in the national classification regarding quality indicators in the field of scientific research. Furthermore, UB ranked among the first three places, as far as the value of research contracts obtained, within national competitions was concerned.</p>
<h2>Studies and Research</h2>
<h3>Departments</h3>
<p>The entire structure of the curricula has been made compatible with the Bologna process. This restructuring has involved a considerable effort of readjustment on the part of all of the University&#x2019;s faculties. The University of Bucharest currently offers thirty-eight graduate domains with approximately 100 majors in all three forms of education: day courses, minimal-attendance, and distance learning. The educational offer at the level of masters&#x2019; studies is extremely diversified, the current offer amounting to 180 programmes. This has allowed for the continuous increase in requests for masters&#x2019; programmes, from graduates of other faculties, as well as requests for professional re-conversion. The University of Bucharest has the necessary human resources for developing masters&#x2019; programmes at an adequate level of quality.</p>
<p>The system of doctoral schools has been generalized in all faculties, ensuring a much more consistent training of the PhD students. The doctoral schools are currently financed by structural funds within three-year projects.</p>
<p>Currently the University has 18 departments (faculties), covering fields such as natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, and theology:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Physics</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Chemistry</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Biology</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Law</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Geography</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Philosophy</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Geology and Geophysics</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Journalism and Communication Studies</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Political Science</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The University also has a publishing house, different research institutes and research groups (such as the Institute for Political Research, the Institute for Mathematics, &lt;!-- Does this refer to the <a>Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy</a>?  If so, why would it belong to the University? --&gt; the Center for Byzantine Studies, the <a>Vasile P&#x00e2;rvan</a> Archeology Seminary, the Center for Nuclear Research, etc.), master and doctorate programmes, and a number of life-long learning facilities and programmes. It has partnership agreements with over 50 universities in 40 countries, and participates in European programmes such as <a>ERASMUS</a>, Lingua, Naric, Leonardo da Vinci, UNICA, AMOS, TEMPUS, TEMPRA. It is an accredited <a>Cisco</a> Academy, has <a>Microsoft</a> curriculum, and is accredited by <a>Red Hat</a> for its academic programme. </p>
<p>The University of Bucharest has been awarded the 2000 National Academic Excellence Diploma, and the 2004 National Academic Excellence Medal. All of the degrees and diplomas awarded by the university are internationally recognised.</p>
<h3>Continuing-Education(Life-long Learning)Programs</h3>
<p>A program for educating adults rapidly developed. The University of Bucharest was one of the first universities in the country that highlighted the importance of lifelong learning programmes. An important part in the rapid development of continuing-education (life-long learning) programmes is played by the CREDIS department, which offered methodology and infrastructure for the functioning of those programmes, or at least supported certain faculties during the first years when those programmes came into force. By means of its continuing-education (life-long learning) programmes, the University of Bucharest proves its capacity of adjustment to the dynamic requirements on the labor market, answering important social needs and ensuring increasingly bigger self-financing.</p>
<h3>Laboratories</h3>
<p>Due to the diversity of academic training domains, the teaching activity at the UB is carried out along nineteen distinct locations, where there are 286 laboratories for undergraduate studies, 187 laboratories for research and activities of master students, and the teaching process is carried out in amphitheatres with a total of 7900 seats, 1941 seats in lecture halls, and 4409 in seminar rooms. The average surface is above two sqm per student.</p>
<h3>Practice Bases</h3>
<p>For the activities and the practical training, the UB has research stations at Or&#x015f;ova, Drobeta Turnu-Severin, M&#x0103;cin and Sf. Gheorge (for Geography), Br&#x0103;ila and Sinaia (for Biology), as well as the Dinosaurs&#x2019; Geopark in Ha&#x0163;eg County (for the use of Geology and Geography students).</p>
<p>The Dinosaurs&#x2019; Geopark of Ha&#x0163;eg County is a natural park with special features. It plays an active part in the economic development of its own territory and offers its inhabitants the opportunity to appreciate the values of territorial heritage.</p>
<p>The dwarf dinosaurs of the fabulous Ha&#x0163;eg County are the best-known dinosaurs in Europe. They remind people about one of the most fascinating episodes of our planet: the great disappearance of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period, 68 million years ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the teaching activity of the Faculty of Geography is carried out at the branches of the faculty from C&#x0103;lim&#x0103;ne&#x015f;ti, M&#x0103;cin, Drobeta Turnu-Severin. The scientific research of the Faculty of Geography from the University of Bucharest covers a large spectrum of domains and issues, geography being exclusively a border science &#x2013; that is a science of interdisciplinary connections.</p>
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>The University of Bucharest has a number of buildings throughout Bucharest, so in that respect it does not have a single campus. Its two main buildings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Old Building, in the University Square (practically right in the center of the city), housing the Faculties of Mathematics and Computer Science, History, Chemistry, Geography, Letters and the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures.</li>
  <li>The Kog&#x0103;lniceanu Building, near the <a>Opera House</a>, housing the Administrative section and the Faculty of Law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other faculties have their own buildings and research facilities, scattered throughout the city, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Departments of Germanic, Slavic and Oriental Languages and Literatures, on Pitar Mo&#x015f; street.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Physics, in the small town of <a>M&#x0103;gurele</a>, situated 16&nbsp;km (10 miles) south of Bucharest.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Political Science, on Sf&#x00e2;ntu &#x015e;tefan street.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Orthodox Theology, in the <a>Unirii Square</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>This, mixed with the fact that student dormitories and other facilities are located in very different locations, prompted the University to print a yearly guide for freshmen.</p>

<h3>&#x201c;Dimitrie Br&#x00e2;ndz&#x0103;&#x201d; Botanical Gardens</h3>
<p>Through its structure, the Botanic Gardens of Bucharest &#x2013; bearing the name of the remarkable professor Dimitrie Br&#x00e2;ndz&#x0103; &#x2013; turned the venerable age of 149 years. Located near the city centre, it is a cultural and educational centre, an active factor in the general process of acknowledging the relationship between man and nature.</p>
<p>It hosts important plant collections where the visitor can perceive the diversity of the vegetal world. Specialists may take advantage of the opportunity to use them in research activities or preservation of the natural richness of our planet.</p>
<h3>The University Museum</h3>
<p>For the Greeks, the museum signified the place dedicated to the inspiring muses of the arts and letters... In times to come, the museums that had been founded&#x2014;as some sort of sanctuaries of history, art and culture that wanted to be preserved&#x2014;had structured their themes on several categories: archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, folklore, history, cultural, military, natural history, as well as the history of art, technology and science.</p>
<p>Open to all those willing to know their past, museums exhibit the most representative objects or artefacts from the domain they represent, thus becoming &#x201c;living schools&#x201d; for those crossing their thresholds. This is what the Museum of the University of Bucharest has set out to be ever since September 1967, the year of its foundation, when Academy member Gheorghe Mihoc, Rector of the University at that time, ordered &#x201c;the foundation of a public collection comprising documentary material, original pieces or significant copies, in view of a scientific reconstitution of the history of this University, with the Rector&#x2019;s Office at the University of Bucharest and within its budget.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Located on the ground floor of the left pavilion in the Palace of the Faculty of Law, the Museum has reached a valuable collection made up of 2486 pieces, most of them out of donations of its own teaching staff, former graduates: prints, documents, rare books, pictures, paintings, furniture, medals, plaques, and various thematic accessories.</p>
<p>The visitor has the opportunity to go through the complicated itinerary of the evolution of Romanian education, with the aid of original documents which mark the evolution of the University of Bucharest from its very foundation. Through their documentary importance, the prints and the documents (acts, incunabula) with great historical value are the most representative, entirely covering the most fertile period of progress within the Romanian educational system, from 1649 until the present day.</p>
<h3>Sport</h3>
<p>The University won the National American Football championship in 1954.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>Students have free access to the offices and main buildings of the &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; Central University Library (Biblioteca Central&#x0103; Universitar&#x0103; &#x201e;Carol I&#x201d;), which is the first large university library in Romania to have introduced an integrated computerized system. The ongoing expansion and increasing performance of the computerized infrastructure offers quick-use opportunities and creative use of documentary resources to its beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Offering a permanent dynamics of cultural and educational traditions, which has defined it since the beginning, BCU &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; was inaugurated, on March 14, 1865, as Royal Foundation.</p>
<p>BCU is an integrated library structure, be comprissed of the Central Unit, with an encyclopaedic profile, and 14 libraries organised as specialized branches, which function within the faculties of the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>Consequently, the current publication fund has a similar encyclopaedic structure, the library owning a total fund of over 1,900,000 volumes from different domains: literature, philosophy, law, psychology, history, geography-geology, management, economics, mathematics, etc.</p>
<p>Here, students, teachers, as well as other categories (unqualified teaching staff, high school students in their senior years, researchers, etc.) can obtain the information needed from the largest university centre in the country. Every year, the BCU halls are visited by over 150,000 students, professors, and other categories of readers; the institution currently has an impressive number of 32,883 individual subscriptions.</p>
<p>The elegant library building has 385 seats, distributed among six specialized reading rooms. In the Europa reading room, one can find publications about Europe, the European Union, the World Bank, other monographic publications and law books. The Minerva reading room offers political works, different specialized dictionaries, catalogues, encyclopaedias, and guides. Also this room displays an important donation of the Chinese Embassy, including works from different domains. As far as periodicals are concerned, 300 magazines and 60 newspapers are available. Moreover, one can read here the Chemical Abstracts, one of the centralizing catalogues, with summaries in the field of Chemistry. As for the fourth reading room, Titu Maiorescu, philosophy, religion, sociology, history, and archaeology books are available on the bookshelves. &#x015e;t. O. Iosif reading room features literature, linguistics, folklore and art books. Those interested in astronomy, chemistry, economics, physics, but also in management or mathematics, can find what they need in the R&#x0103;dulescu-Motru reading room. Finally, the last reading room, Simion Mehendin&#x0163;i, contains medicine, biology, botany, geography-geology, technical engineering.</p>
<p>BCU offers free access to international academic databases: PROQUEST, EBSCO, and SPRINGER. Here, one can find 20,000 periodicals that can be accessed, in full text, with automatic translation from French into English or vice versa.</p>
<p>Through the INTERNET services, the BCU &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; network is integrated into the dynamics of the world circuit of information. The connection with national and international databases at an academic level ensures synchronization with contemporary tendencies of knowledge, offering users a remarkable potential for study and research. 14 libraries function within the faculties of the University of Bucharest, its branches specializing in different domains: literature, philosophy, law, psychology, history, geography-geology, management, economics, and mathematics; the current publication fund consists of over 1,000,000 volumes.</p>
<p>The university also has a virtual library (eBooks) which is made up of reference sites existing on the Internet. Furthermore, the site of the University, &#x201c;Unibuc Classica&#x201d;, hosts seminal works by several famous professors of the institution (Nicolae Iorga, A.D. Xenopol, G. C&#x0103;linescu).</p>
<h2>International Academic Cooperation</h2>
<p>One of the main objectives the University pays great attention to is international academic cooperation. There are 200 agreements for bilateral inter-university and inter-departmental cooperation with universities from Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Chile, China, Egypt, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Iran, India, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, the Republic of Moldova, Senegal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Slovenia, the United Arab Emirates, USA, Sweden, Russia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, etc. The University has 130 bilateral agreements for joint supervision doctoral studies and an intense collaboration within numerous community programmes &#x2013; ERASMUS, LEONARDO DA VINCI, and GRUNDTVIG.</p>
<p>Its intense international activity makes the University of Bucharest makes the University of Bucharest increasingly more notorious in Europe and worldwide. The number of ERASMUS students who come to learn with us is close to 100 per year, and many choose to remain a second semester as well, because the learning environment seems favorable to them. The number of students coming from African and Asian countries has also risen. The University has programmes in foreign languages that are offered on a yearly basis to the 1000 foreign students.</p>
<p>The ERASMUS programme is a component of the Community Education Programme (Lifelong Learning Programme &#x2013; LLP), which sets out to help university mobility &#x2013; both for undergraduate students / master students / doctoral students as well as teaching staff. Another ERASMUS objective is encouraging the cooperation between universities in Europe in the field of higher-education. The development of the European dimension of graduate and post-graduate studies is supported through ERASMUS, since the programme covers all disciplines and study areas within the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ERASMUS programme is to facilitate the creation of European unity and identity by means of study travel from one country to another. It is not a physics or theology programme. The European Union wishes to lay the human foundations of a European identity through a means that are, at the same time, simple and inevitable: travel. Travel favors direct contact between people and cultures. They remove clich&#x00e9;s learned through life experiences. They replace memories from books as well as personal memories. They reward you with friends. They offer you the opportunity of speaking another language, of tasting unknown dishes, of seeing new landscapes, of observing how the trade you train for is learned in another country, with a different history, with other customs, with a different social structure. This is valuable in itself, and does not need other excuses or explanations.</p>
<p>Within this programme there are 286 agreements with European universities that offer opportunities for both students and professors to carry out study terms, teaching terms, take part in common projects to be implemented in curricula, intensive courses or activities in thematic networks dedicated to the development of a graduate domain. The mobility offered within this programme is coordinated by the ERASMUS Office for Community Programs within UB. The University is also a member in several European and international academic organizations &#x2013; the European Universities Association (EUA), the University Agency for Francophony (AUF), the Association of Universities from European Capital Cities (UNICA), and the Black Sea University Network (BSUN). The University has established partnerships with other governmental or non-governmental organizations such as DAAD, USIA, the Humboldt Foundations, Volkswagen, Fulbright, Nippon, and Onassis.</p>
