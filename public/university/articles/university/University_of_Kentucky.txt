<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Kentucky</strong>, also known as <strong>UK</strong>, is a <a>public</a>, <a>co-educational</a>, <a>university</a>, and is one of the state's two <a>land-grant universities</a>, located in <a>Lexington</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>. Founded in 1865 by John Bowman as the <em>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky</em>, Courses were offered at <a>Ashland, The Henry Clay Estate</a>. For the new school, Lexington donated a 52 <a>acre</a> (210,000 m&#x00b2;) park and fair ground, which became the core of UK's present campus. The particular hue of blue was determined from a necktie, which was used to demonstrate the color of royal blue. This was followed up by the creation of the university's <em>Agricultural Extension service</em> in 1910, which was one of the first in the <a>United States</a>. The extension service became a mode of the federally mandated programs that were required beginning in 1914. This was completed after a series of studies were conducted that highlighted the health needs of the citizens, as well as the need to train more physicians for the state. Five years later, the <a>College of Medicine</a> and <a>College of Nursing</a> opened, followed by the <a>College of Dentistry</a> in 1962. In response, Governor <a>Louie Nunn</a> deferred to the <a>National Guard</a> in an attempt to disperse the protesters. An outdated <a>ROTC</a> building was destroyed by fire. The <a>Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History</a> at the University of Kentucky Libraries has 13 <a>oral history interviews</a> with participants in the protests, university officials as well as former governor Nunn.  Nine years later, the Singletary Center for the Arts opened, named in honor of former university president Otis Singletary. The six-level William T. Young Library was constructed on south campus and the largest book endowment among all public university libraries in the country. The Biological Pharmaceutical Complex Building complements the adjacent <a>Biomedical Biological Science Research Building</a>, and is expected to be part of the new university research campus. Other recent announcements include the construction of the new $450 million <a>Albert B. Chandler Hospital</a>, which will be one of the largest projects in the state's history in terms of size and economic impact.</p>
<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>On January 12, 2007, the university's &quot;Domestic Partner Benefits Committee&quot; unanimously voted recommending <a>domestic partner</a> benefits, such as <a>health insurance</a> and employee education benefits, to <a>homosexual</a> couples and unmarried <a>heterosexual</a> couples to help enhance the university's competitiveness in attracting top faculty and staff, part of the &quot;Top 20&quot; plan. The program stemmed from a work-life survey of university employees in 2005 and 2006, and led to several proposals to improve employee conditions that would affect 13,600 employees, of which 68 are same-sex partners, and 272 opposite-sex partners. The estimated cost of the original domestic partner benefits program would be $633,000 annually, less than 1% of the university's $68.2 million annual health care budget; 40% of which would be paid from the university's undesignated general funds, with the remainder coming from various grants, contracts, athletics, and hospital revenues. The measure was also opposed by state <a>House</a> <a>Republican</a> Stan Lee, who filed a bill to ban domestic partner coverage at Kentucky's public universities, and by state Senate Republican <a>Vernie McGaha</a>, who sponsored Senate Bill 152 to ban state and local governments, public and private colleges, and some quasi-government institutions from offering domestic partner benefits. Both bills were never passed.</p>
<p>University President <a>Lee T. Todd, Jr.</a> endorsed the benefits proposal on April 24, 2007.</p>
<p>On June 18, the &quot;Sponsored Benefits Plan&quot;, an amended plan that eliminates the conflict with the definition of <a>marriage</a> in the <a>Kentucky Constitution</a>, took effect on July 1. The revised plan uses no state appropriated funds.</p>
<p>Lexington Herald-Leader articles on December 10, 2008 and February 10, 2009 discussed  the controversy over the proposal that the entire UK campus would be made tobacco free. Following a failed attempt by the UK Task Force to extend the ban to public sidewalks, the campus wide ban was implemented November 19, 2009 with no enforcement.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Completed in 1998, the William T. Young Library serves both the university campus and the Commonwealth of Kentucky</a>  The University of Kentucky is home to numerous notable structures, such as <a>Main Building</a>, a four-story administration building dating to 1882,</p>
<p>The University of Kentucky once operated 14 <a>community college</a>s with more than 100 extended sites, centers and campuses under the <a>Kentucky Community and Technical College System</a>, but relinquished control under the <a>Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997</a>. The network of community colleges is now known as the <a>Kentucky Community and Technical College System</a> (KCTCS). Adjoining <a>Lexington Community College</a>, despite the reorganization of the community colleges, remained integrated with the university, but separated from the University of Kentucky in 2004 and became a part of KCTCS.</p>
<p>The College of Engineering currently operates a satellite campus in <a>Paducah</a>, located on the campus of <a>West Kentucky Community and Technical College</a>.</p>
<h3>Campus Safety</h3>
<p>The University of Kentucky campus area has been the scene of multiple incidents.  On July 17, 1994, a sniper hiding in bushes along Woodland Ave. near campus shot and killed UK football player Trent Digiuro as he sat on the front porch of his house celebrating his upcoming 21st birthday.  The gunman's alleged motive was being blackballed from the <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity.  UK Student Shane Ragland pled guilty to manslaughter and DiGiuro's parents later won a $60 million civil penalty. <a>thumb|left|210px|Funkhouser Building</a> On August 29, 1997 UK student Christopher Maier and a girlfriend were attacked while walking along railroad tracks near the UK campus after a party.  Maier was bludgeoned to death and the girl was raped and beaten but survived.  &quot;Railroad killer&quot; <a>&#x00c1;ngel Maturino Res&#x00e9;ndiz</a> later confessed to the crime.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2002 UK students Jeffrey Pfetzer and Matthew Rzepka were roughhousing on the third floor of UK's Kirwan tower high rise when they fell against a window that broke.  Both men fell to their deaths.  The cause of the accident was attributed to the use of plate glass in the building, rather than stronger tempered glass.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2006 the <em>Lexington Herald Leader</em> reported that 7 to 10 gunshots were fired outside the Kirwan-Blanding dormitory complex around 3:15 am.  No one was injured, but a bullet pierced a 12th floor window in Kirwan Tower.  A 22-year-old man was beaten, according to Maj. Joe Monroe of UK Police.</p>
<p>On September 23, 2006, UK student Lauren Fannin and friend Lindsey Harp were swept into a storm drain and drowned near the UK campus after stepping out of a taxi cab into flooded Nicholasville Rd.  Neighbors had repeatedly warned UK officials that increased paving of fields near Commonwealth Stadium would cause increased flooding.</p>

<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Currently the university's undergraduate program is ranked 128th in the nation according to <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>'s</em> college rankings. The University of Kentucky has &quot;Top 20&quot; programs in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Anatomy</a> and <a>neurobiology</a>,</li>
  <li><a>Clinical psychology</a>,</li>
  <li>Diplomacy/international relations at the <a>Patterson School</a>,</li>
  <li><a>Educational psychology</a>,</li>
  <li><a>Hispanic</a> studies,</li>
  <li>Martin School of Public Policy and Administration,</li>
  <li><a>Physiology</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>The university ranks 137th in the world as a &quot;top level institution&quot; for finance and economics research output.</p>
<p>The university also ranks 19th in the nation among public research universities based upon the level of faculty scholarly activity, according to the 2005 Faculty Scholarly Activity Index. Prior endowments were $538.4 million in 2005 and $195.1 million in 1997, the rapid increases partially attributed to the &quot;Top 20&quot; Plan. According to the compact, states with &quot;Top 20&quot; universities feature higher average household incomes, higher education attainments, healthier lives and more financial security. As a result, fewer citizens live in poverty and as a result, fewer public dollars are spent on health care.</li>
  <li>Research expenditures increased from $124.8 million in 1996 to $297.6 million in 2003.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Statewide Facilities Condition Assessment Report</em> released on April 4, 2007, the University needs $12.5 billion to complete the 1997 mandate to become a &quot;Top 20&quot; institution.</p>
<p>On August 17, 2008 <em>The Lexington Herald-Leader</em> reported that <a>Forbes Magazine</a> ranked UK number 468 (out of 569 colleges surveyed) on its list of &quot;America's Best Colleges 2008&quot;.</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>The University of Kentucky has many student-based service and advocacy groups.  The Center for Community Outreach is the university's largest volunteer organization, and hosts two of the largest events on campus, UKFUSION and DanceBlue <a>Dance Marathon</a>.</p>
<h3>Student Government</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2003, two-time President of the Student Government Tim Robinson pleaded guilty in Fayette County Circuit Court to charges of interfering with voter registration. He resigned from his position from student government. The charges were the result of Robinson's failure to turn in 747 voter registration cards to the County Clerk. A voter registration drive was meant to threaten members of the city council that proposed laws to curb student partying.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>The University of Kentucky is currently served by two independent <a>FM</a> stations. The first, 91.3 FM <a>WUKY</a>, is an <a>Triple-A</a> station and was the first university-owned FM radio station in the <a>United States</a> and <a>Kentucky</a>'s first public radio station. The operations started on October 17, 1940 as <a>WBKY</a> out of <a>Beattyville</a>, although the station moved five years later to Lexington. In 1971, the station was one of the first to carry NPR's &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and helped debut <a>National Public Radio</a>, changing its call letters to WUKY in 1989 to better reflect its affiliation with the university. In 2007, it became the first Lexington radio station to broadcast in high-definition digital radio. WRFL is operated by students and broadcasts live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and features music that is spread across most genres.</p>
<p>The campus is also served by the <a>Kentucky Kernel</a>, a student-run, financially independent daily newspaper, with the first issue published in 1915. The official <a>yearbook</a> of the University of Kentucky is the <em>Kentuckian</em>, first published in 1906. 216,737 in the <a>United States</a>, and 1,119 internationally. The University of Kentucky Alumni Association is the primary affiliation for former students and faculty, and is located at the corner of Rose Street and Euclid Avenue. The building, dedicated in 1963, is named for Helen G. King, the first permanent director of the association and was former &quot;Miss University of Kentucky.&quot; The association also meets at Spindletop Hall, a large mansion along Iron Works Pike, which serves as a central alumni gathering point.</p>
<p>The University of Kentucky boasts seven governors, including current <a>Governor of Kentucky</a> <a>Steve Beshear</a>, current <a>Governor of Ohio</a> <a>Ted Strickland</a>, current <a>Governor of North Carolina</a> <a>Beverly Perdue</a>, and former governors <a>Ernie Fletcher</a>, <a>Paul E. Patton</a> and <a>Tom Jefferson Terral</a>, and former governor, <a>U.S. Senator</a> and Commissioner of <a>Major League Baseball</a> <a>Albert &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler</a>. It also claims <a>Ken Lucas</a>, a former <a>U.S. representative</a> from the commonwealth's fourth <a>congressional district</a>, United Methodist Bishop <a>Alfred W. Gwinn</a>, current <a>U.S. Senator</a> <a>Mitch McConnell</a>, Carol Gatton, an automobile dealer executive and donor of the largest gift ever to the university, and Paul Chellgren, <a>Chairman</a> and <a>CEO</a> of <a>Ashland Inc.</a>. The university was also the home of Dr. <a>Thomas Hunt Morgan</a>, a scientist and winner of the 1933 <a>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>, and <a>William Lipscomb</a>, 1976 winner of the <a>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKChron&quot;/&gt;</p>
