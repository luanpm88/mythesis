<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Memorial Hall</a> Bethel College's academic program exposes students to three educational traditions: liberal arts, the church, and career preparation. General education courses give basic academic skills, providing a broad understanding of the social and natural world from the perspective of the liberal arts and sciences. Required Bible and religion classes encourage intellectual discussions of ethical perspectives and spiritual values. Focused study in a major field lays the groundwork for vocational success.</p>
<h3>Core values</h3>
<p>The programs at Bethel College are grounded in four core values.  These values are shown in daily routines at this institution.  They include, first, an ethic of <a>discipleship</a>, that recognizes Jesus Christ is the <a>Messiah</a> and model for the <a>Christian</a> life and values a high level of commitment and free conviction; next an ethic of <a>scholarship</a>, that believes academic achievement is a logical out-come of intellectual stewardship, valuing discipline and creativity; third, an ethic of service, that believes concern for the powerless is essential to the Christian gospel and emphasizes the importance of peacemaking and volunteering of services; and finally an ethic of integrity, that celebrates the connections between <a>spirit</a> and mind, <a>faith</a> and learning, individual and community, and fosters personal development through participation in a range of activities.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Bethel&#x2019;s curriculum is founded on a general education program in the liberal arts and <a>sciences</a> and is geared toward students of moderate to high <a>academic</a> ability. Distinctive elements include requirements in the study of <a>religion</a> and a cross-cultural experience. The college offers majors in the traditional liberal arts disciplines and selected career areas and accredited professional programs in <a>nursing</a>, <a>social work</a>, and teacher <a>education</a>. Academic development services are provided to enhance the skills of all students. By design, Bethel&#x2019;s student profile reflects its church affiliation. At the same time, the college values diversity in its student body and seeks to enroll a variety of individuals desiring high-quality education for the whole person..</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Founded in 1887 and conferring its first four-year degrees in 1912, Bethel is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Starting in 1874, thousands of <a>Russian Mennonite</a>s began arriving in Kansas. In 1882, having a century of experience running their own schools, they opened Emmental, a training school for teachers, north of <a>Newton, Kansas</a>. The school was moved to <a>Halstead, Kansas</a>, in 1883. A better site was found in North Newton, Kansas, and the cornerstone of the main building was laid on October 12, 1888. This structure, the current Administration Building, is on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<h3>Campus relocation</h3>
<p>The Halstead school was closed for the 1892&#x2013;1893 school year while it was relocated to the new site and reopened as Bethel College in 1893. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the <a>General Conference Mennonite Church</a>, replacing <a>Wadsworth Institute</a> which had closed in 1878.</p>
<h3>North Newton</h3>
<p>During the 1880s, Kansas cities and towns competed with one another to create, build, and construct many institutions and buildings including colleges. On May 11, 1887, representatives of the Newton community and the Kansas Conference of Mennonites signed a charter for Bethel College to be built on a plot of about . Over a year later on October 12, 1888, around 2,500 people gathered on the property to lay the cornerstone of what is today the Administration Building of Bethel College.  The dedication sermon was based on the Corinthians motto, which was placed on the seal, which now stands for Bethel College and its values. The building project took around five years to fully complete. The fund-raising to create the institution was slow, but on September 20, 1893 there was a service of dedication held for the building to be opened, and classes began.</p>
<h3>First college president</h3>
<p>Cornelius H. Wedel, a young teacher, was made Bethel College&#x2019;s first president. There were 98 students &ndash; 77 men and 21 women ages 13 to mid-30s &ndash; living on the west end of the main floor and the ground floor of the Administration Building.  Wedel and his family lived on the east end of the Administration Building&#x2019;s main floor.  The classrooms, <a>chapel</a>, and <a>library</a> of 600 volumes were located on the second floor. In those days, the students were up by five in the morning and in bed by ten at night. Each student worked two hours a day at a <a>campus</a> job.  Student conduct was strictly monitored.  Men and women were not allowed to be in the library during the same evenings; they alternated each evening. Five men, including the president, made up the first faculty. They taught classes in the Bible, church history, <a>German</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>science</a>, and <a>music</a>. Bethel College was a bilingual college until early 1918, when the U.S. entered <a>World War I</a>. German was removed from the curriculum, although it would later return. As of 2008, Bethel is the only Mennonite college to offer German as a major.</p>
<h2>Campus facilities</h2>
<p>The Administration Building was the main campus <a>structure</a> until 1925 when the Science Hall was completed. The cornerstone for Memorial Hall was laid in 1938, and the building was completed in 1942. The <a>Art Center</a> is another building that has been present for many years. In 1952 the Mennonite Library and Archives was built. In 1979, the current student center/cafeteria was built.  The newest building is the Thresher Stadium in the Thresher Sports Complex. Another newly-constructed academic building is the Krehbiel Science Center, completed in 2002.</p>
<p>There are three student residence halls located on campus.  They are Haury Hall (completed in 1958 and expanded in 1963), Warkentin Court (completed in 1966), and the newer Voth Hall (completed in 2000) .</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Administration Building</a> :<em>See <a>Bethel College Threshers</a></em> Bethel College offers many <a>sport</a>s, including <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross-country</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>track</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>.  In the 2006-07 season, three of Bethel's coaches were named <a>conference</a> Coach of the Year.  The Threshers have won more than 55 conference titles.  During 1998-99 alone, six of the ten Thresher teams won conference <a>championships</a> (Sports).  At Bethel College the athletes also compete academically; 89 student athletes have been named <a>American</a> Scholar Athletes.  Bethel College Athletic Director Diane Flickner said, &#x201c;Intercollegiate athletics is an integral part of life at Bethel College.  Thresher intercollegiate teams strive toward excellence in all of their goals.  Success is not defined simply by a winning record but also by community involvement, the joy of playing, cooperation, friendships, skill <a>improvement</a> and the pride of representing Bethel College.  Student-athletes develop life long skills of teamwork, self-discipline and leadership in an environment committed to Christian higher education&#x201d; .</p>
