<p><strong>Clark Kerr</strong> (May 17, 1911 &#x2013; December 1, 2003) was an American professor of economics and academic administrator. He was the first <a>chancellor</a> of the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a> and twelfth president of the <a>University of California</a>.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Kerr was born in <a>Stony Creek, Pennsylvania</a>, and earned his <a>A.B.</a> from <a>Swarthmore College</a> in 1932, an <a>M.A.</a> from <a>Stanford University</a> in 1933, and a <a>Ph.D.</a> in economics from UC Berkeley in 1939. In 1945, he became an associate professor of industrial relations and was the founding director of the Institute of Industrial Relations.</p>
<h3>Career</h3>
<h4>U.C. Berkeley</h4>
<p>During the <a>McCarthy era</a> in 1949, the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> adopted an <a>anti-communist</a> loyalty oath to be signed by all University of California employees. Kerr signed the oath, but fought against the firing of those who refused to sign. Kerr gained respect from his stance and was named UC Berkeley's first chancellor when that position was created in 1952. As chancellor, Kerr oversaw the construction of 12 high-rise dormitories. In September, 1953, President <a>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> appointed him to the <a>Commission on Intergovernmental Relations</a>.</p>
<h4>University of California regents</h4>
<p>In 1958, Kerr was the Regents' choice to lead the entire university system. His term as UC president saw the opening of campuses in <a>San Diego</a>, <a>Irvine</a>, and <a>Santa Cruz</a> to accommodate the influx of <a>baby boom</a>ers. Faced with a dramatic increase of students entering college, Kerr helped establish the now much-copied <a>California system</a> of having the handful of <a>University of California</a> campuses act as 'top tier' research institutions, the more numerous <a>California State University</a> campuses handle the bulk of undergraduate students and the very numerous <a>California Community College</a> campuses provide vocational and transfer-oriented college programs to the remainder.</p>
<p>In 1959, Kerr along with Chancellor <a>Glenn T. Seaborg</a> helped found the Berkeley <a>Space Sciences Laboratory</a>.</p>
<h4>Student protests</h4>
<p><a>thumb|Clark Kerr on the cover of <em>TIME</em>, October 17, 1960</a> Controversy exploded in 1964 when Berkeley students led the <a>Free Speech Movement</a> in protest of regulations limiting political activities on campus, including Civil Rights advocacy and <a>protests against the Vietnam war</a>. It culminated in hundreds of arrested students at a sit-in. Kerr&#x2019;s initial decision was to not expel University of California students that participated in sit-ins off campus. That decision evolved into reluctance to expel students who later would protest on campus in a series of escalating events on the Berkeley campus in late 1964. Kerr was criticized both by students for not agreeing to their demands and by conservative UC Regent <a>Edwin Pauley</a> and others for responding too leniently to the student unrest.</p>
<h4>Blacklisting</h4>
<p>In 2002, the <a>FBI</a> released documents that had Kerr blacklisted as part of a campaign to suppress people at UC deemed subversive. This information had been classified by the FBI and was only released after a fifteen-year legal battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court. President <a>Lyndon Johnson</a> had picked Kerr to become secretary of Health, Education and Welfare but withdrew the nomination after the FBI background check on Kerr included damaging information the agency knew to be false. </p>
<p><a>Edwin Pauley</a> approached the CIA Director <a>John McCone</a> (a Berkeley alum and associate) for assistance. McCone in turn met with FBI Director <a>J. Edgar Hoover</a>. Hoover agreed to supply Pauley with confidential FBI information on &quot;ultra-liberal&quot; regents, faculty members, and students, and to assist in removing Kerr. Pauley received dozens of briefings from the FBI to this end. The FBI assisted Pauley and <a>Ronald Reagan</a> in painting Kerr as a dangerous &quot;liberal.&quot;</p>
<p>Kerr's perceived leniency was key in Reagan's election as <a>Governor of California</a> in 1966  and in Kerr's dismissal as president by the university&#x2019;s Board of Regents in 1967. In response, Kerr stated that he left the university just as he entered it: &quot;fired with enthusiasm.&quot;</p>
<p>Kerr&#x2019;s second memoir, <em>The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the <a>University of California</a>, 1949-1967 Volume Two: Political Turmoil</em> details what he refers to as his greatest blunders in dealing with the <a>Free Speech Movement</a> that ultimately led to his firing.</p>

<p>Following his dismissal, Kerr served on the <a>Carnegie Commission on Higher Education</a> until 1973 and was chairman of the <a>Carnegie Council on Policy Studies</a> in Higher Education from 1974 to 1979.</p>
<p>Kerr also served as Chairman, 1984 USPS National Agreement arbitration chairman&#x2014;and then joined the USPS panel of national contract arbitrators.</p>
<h3>Personal life</h3>
<p>Kerr was married to Catherine Spaulding on Christmas Day, 1934. They had three children; Clark E., Jr., Alexander, and Caroline Gage. He died in his sleep in <a>El Cerrito, California</a>, following complications from a fall.</p>
<h2>Legacy and honors</h2>
<p>There are Kerr Halls on the campuses of <a>U.C. Davis</a>, <a>U.C. Santa Barbara</a>, <a>U.C. Santa Cruz</a>, and U.C. Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Berkeley facility is located a few blocks from the main campus, and includes residences and sports practice facilities. The Spanish-style residential complex houses 700 students and features landscaped gardens and a conference center. It was previously the site of the <a>California School for the Deaf and Blind</a>, and was acquired by The University after a court battle.  (The University was not a party to the case.  It was offered the site after the Schools for the Deaf and Blind relinquished it to the State as surplus property.)</p>
<p>The <a>Clark Kerr Medal</a> is named in his honor.</p>
<p>Another legacy was his wit&#x2014;after writing a serious book &quot;The Purposes of the University&quot;, Kerr surprised an audience with this riposte--&quot;The three purposes of the University?--To provide sex for the students, sports for the alumni, and parking for the faculty.&quot;</p>
<p>And after being fired by California's Governor (future President) Ronald Reagan, Kerr responded that he left office as he had begun--&quot;Fired with enthusiasm&quot;.</p>
