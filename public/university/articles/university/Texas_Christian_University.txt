<p> <strong>Texas Christian University</strong> (<strong>TCU</strong>) is a <a>private</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>university</a> located in <a>Fort Worth, Texas</a> and was founded in 1873. TCU is affiliated with, but not governed by, the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a>. Its mascot is the <a>&quot;horned frog&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>TCU enrolls 8,799 students, 7,600 of which are undergraduates.  </p>
<p>The university is classified as a Tier 1 institution by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|175px|Thorp Spring, Texas, campus.</a> East Texas brothers Addison &amp; Randolph Clark, together with their father Joseph A. Clark, founded what was then called the AddRan Male &amp; Female College in 1873 after the brothers had returned from service in the <a>American Civil War</a>.  The college was named after AddRan Clark, the first son of Addison.  The boy died of diphtheria at the age of three.  His name was derived from a contraction of the two brothers' names.  That name is now preserved in TCU's AddRan College of Liberal Arts.  It memorializes the university's connection with its founders. <a>thumb|left|175px|Early image of the TCU campus in Fort Worth.</a> The Clarks were scholar-preacher/teachers who were products of the <a>Campbellite movement</a>, one of the streams of the <a>Restoration movement</a> in the nineteenth-century American church.  The Campbellites were the spiritual ancestors of the modern <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a>, the <a>independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ</a>, and the <a>non-instrumental Churches of Christ (non-institutional)</a>.  Campbellites were also major proponents of education, and the Clarks operated a preparatory school, the Male &amp; Female Seminary of Fort Worth, from 1869 to 1874.  But they also envisioned an institution of higher learning for both men and women that would be Christian in character, but nonsectarian in spirit and intellectually open-minded. <a>thumb|left|175px|TCU students inside a dorm room at Jarvis Hall.</a> <a>thumb|right|175px|Statue of TCU founders Addison and Randolph Clark.</a> They planned to establish their college in <a>Fort Worth</a> on five city blocks purchased for that purpose in 1869.  However, from 1867&#x2013;1872, the character of Fort Worth changed substantially due to the commercial influence of the <a>Chisholm Trail</a>, the principal route for moving Texas cattle to the Kansas railheads.  A huge influx of cattle, men, and money transformed the sleepy frontier village into a booming, brawling cowtown. The area around the property purchased by the Clarks for their college soon became the town's vice district, an unrelieved stretch of saloons, gambling halls, dance parlors, and bawdy houses catering to the rough tastes of the Chisholm Trail cowboys.  Its rough and rowdy reputation had, by 1872, acquired it the nickname of &quot;Hell's Half Acre&quot; (the heart of which is today occupied by the Fort Worth Convention Center and the <a>Fort Worth Water Gardens</a>).</p>
<p>The Clarks feared this negative environment undermined the fledgling university's mission. They began to look for an alternative site to establish their college, and they found it at <a>Thorp Spring</a>, a small community and stagecoach stop  to the southwest, near the frontier of <a>Comanche</a> and <a>Kiowa</a> territory.  It was perhaps a marker of their Campbellite sensibilities that the Clarks feared the Indians less than they feared the corrupting influence of &quot;the Acre.&quot;</p>
<p>AddRan College (TCU) was one of the first <a>coeducation</a>al institutions of higher education west of the Mississippi River, and the very first in Texas&#x2014;a progressive step at a time when only 15% of the national college enrollment was female and almost all were enrolled at women's colleges.  The inaugural enrollment in Fall 1873 was 13 students, though this number rose to 123 by the end of the first term.  Shortly thereafter, annual enrollment ranged from 200 to 400.  The college formed a partnership with what would become the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a> in 1889 and was renamed AddRan Christian University.  The church does not own or operate TCU; TCU is self-owned and self-governing.  The church partnership is based on a common Disciples heritage and shared values.</p>
<p>The need for a larger population and transportation base prompted the university to relocate to <a>Waco</a> from 1895 to 1910.  A featured speaker at the Waco welcoming ceremony was the president of crosstown rival, <a>Baylor University</a>.  The institution was renamed Texas Christian University in 1902, though almost immediately it was dubbed with the unofficial moniker by which it is most popularly known today: TCU.</p>
<p>In 1910, a fire of unknown origin destroyed the university's main administration building.  A group of enterprising <a>Fort Worth</a> businessmen offered the university $200,000 in rebuilding money and a  campus as an inducement to relocate from Waco to their city.  This move brought TCU home to the historic source of its institutional roots.  It also completed TCU's nearly 40-year transition from a frontier college to an urban university.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|500px|Jarvis Hall</a> TCU's campus sits on  and is located just five miles (8&nbsp;km) from <a>downtown Fort Worth</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly two-thirds of TCU undergraduate students live on campus.  Housing is divided among 13 residence halls and a community of on-campus apartments.  Students are required to live in an on-campus residence hall, most of which are co-ed, for at least their Freshman and Sophomore years, though many students choose to remain on-campus for their entire time at TCU.</p>
<p>TCU's campus is bisected by University Drive, an oak-lined street which roughly divides the campus into a residential area and an academic area.  Residence halls, Brown-Lupton University Union, and the Campus Commons are all located West of University Drive, while the library, chapel, and most academic buildings are located East of University Drive.  All of TCU's surrounding streets are lined by <a>live oaks</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Brown-Lupton University Union</a>The architecture at TCU is consistent with much of the architecture of older buildings throughout <a>Fort Worth</a>.  Most of the buildings at TCU are constructed with yellow brick.  Nearly all of the buildings feature arches and red-tile roofs, while the oldest buildings on campus, including Jarvis Hall, Sadler Hall, and the Bailey Building, are supported by columns of various styles.</p>
<p>A notable exception to this rule is Robert Carr Chapel, which was the first building on campus to be constructed of a material other than yellow brick.  The chapel is built of a distinctive red brick, a deviation which caused alumni protest when it opened in 1953.  The steeple of Robert Carr Chapel is officially the highest point on the TCU campus, as it symbolizes importance the university places on religion.  Athletic facilities, as well as Fraternity and Sorority housing, are located across Stadium Drive and West of the Campus Commons.  In recent years TCU has upgraded many of its athletic buildings.  In 2007, the university opened <a>Sammy Baugh</a> Indoor Practice Facility, a state of the art indoor practice building located where the intramural baseball field and astronomy tower used to be.  In 2003 the university opened Lupton Baseball Stadium, and as of 2010 major renovations are being planned for <a>Amon Carter Stadium</a>.<a>thumb|right|200px|The Horned Frog in Spring</a> </p>
<p>TCU is also home to the Starpoint School, a laboratory school for elementary-aged students.  Starpoint's goal is develop advanced educational techniques for helping students with <a>learning disabilities</a>. Starpoint School and its playground are located between Sherley Hall and Colby Hall, two historically female dormitories.</p>
<p>Since 2007, much of the campus has been under construction and many buildings have been either renovated or replaced.  The newest addition to TCU's campus is Scharbauer Hall, which opened in 2010 and houses the bulk of AddRan College's offices and classrooms, including TCU's Political Science and Foreign Language departments.  Scharbauer also is home to the prestigious and highly-selective John V. Roach Honors College. The seemingly perpetual renovation process has led some students and faculty to refer to TCU as &quot;Texas Construction University.&quot;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> TCU is listed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education as a medium-sized, Doctoral/Research university.  The university offers 100 undergraduate majors, 54 master's programs, and 12 doctoral programs.<a>thumb|left|200px|Veteran's Plaza</a></p>
<p>The Carnegie Classification lists TCU's undergraduate profile as &quot;More Selective,&quot; its highest ranking.  In 2009 TCU's acceptance rate was 59%.</p>
<p>Among 2,400 four-year colleges and universities in the United States, TCU is routinely ranked as being in the top 5 percent, also known as Tier 1, by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a><strong>.</p>
<p>There are about 75,000 living TCU alumni.</p>
<p>The undergraduate enrollment is 76% white, 7% Hispanic, 5% black, and 2.5% Asian. The remaining 9.5% is of another ethnic background, or is unlisted.</p>
<p>TCU also enrolls a high percentage of transfer students.  At least 20 percent of TCU's annual incoming undergraduate class consists of transfer students.</p>

<h3>Institutions</h3>
<p>&lt;/div&gt; </p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Sadler Hall</a> Offering more than 200 official student organizations, TCU offers a robust social scene.  Students may also compete in intramural sports ranging from basketball to shuffleboard, or join a number of unofficial organizations, such as the TCU Quidditch League.  Recently the university has also been hosting big-name concerts on the Campus Commons.  In 2008, TCU celebrated completion of the Brown-Lupton Union by hosting a concert by popular country artist <a>Pat Green</a> on the commons.  The university followed that performance up in Spring of 2009, when it held a concert by <a>One Republic</a> following a football victory over Texas State. TCU students were allowed to attend both events for free.</p>
<p>TCU has a small drag located along University and Berry streets, which features a number of popular venues within walking distance of the campus.  Fuzzy's Tacos, Perotti's Pizza, and Dutch's Hamburgers (named after longtime TCU football coach <a>Dutch Meyer</a>) are usually filled with students.  Popular bars within walking distance include The Pub, Buffalo Bros. and The Aardvark, the latter two of which hosts live music performances Thursday through Saturday.</p>
<p>Off campus, TCU is located a half-mile south of the Fort Worth Zoo and the Fort Worth Botanical Gardens.  The Fort Worth Cultural District, the Southwest's largest museum &amp; arts campus which includes six museums including three important art galleries: the <a>Amon Carter Museum</a>, the <a>Kimball Art Museum</a> and the <a>Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>, are off University Drive a mile north of the TCU campus. Also located in this district are three performance theaters, the Scott, the Sanders and Casa Manana. Students also visit downtown Fort Worth and the famous <a>Sundance Square</a>, only three miles from campus, for entertainment. The historic <a>Fort Worth Stockyards</a> are also within easy driving distance, and many students visit <a>Billy Bob's</a> Honky Tonk on Thursday nights for country music and dancing.</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p>The Schieffer School of Journalism circulates a number of student-run publications:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>TCU has strived for a greener campus by launching the &#x201c;Think Purple, Live Green&#x201d; Campaign. So far, the campaign has been moderately successful and has had over 1800 signatories to the &#x201c;TCU Live Green Pledge.&quot; Incentives have been offered to students that find innovative ways to live more sustainably on campus, and the university is also converting some of its lighting to low-flow fixtures.</p>
<p>Some faculty members also run a &quot;Purple Bike&quot; program, which allows students to rent purple bicycles free of charge, to be used instead of cars.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|230px|The University Rec Center</a> </p>
<p>TCU competes in <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) sports as a member of the Division I <a>Mountain West Conference</a>. Over its history, TCU was a long-time member of the now defunct <a>Southwest Conference</a>.  TCU will be moving to the <a>Big East Conference</a> in all sports on July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>TCU's varsity sports have a long and storied history of excellence, boasting eight men's and ten women's varsity squads. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, cross country and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, volleyball, golf, swimming &amp; diving, cross country, track &amp; field, soccer, rifle, equestrian, and tennis.</p>
<p>In recent years the university has made significant upgrades to its athletics facilities, including construction of the $13 million Abe-Martin Academic Enhancement Center, which was completed in August 2008.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Horned Frogs have won two national championships, one in 1935 and the other in 1938. Additionally, the team has captured fourteen conference championships. Many notable football players have played for TCU, including <a>Sammy Baugh</a>, <a>Davey O'Brien</a>, <a>Jim Swink</a>, <a>Bob Lilly</a>, and <a>LaDainian Tomlinson</a>.</p>
<p>Many other Horned Frogs also currently play in the NFL.</p>
<p>The Horned Frogs play their home games in <a>Amon G. Carter Stadium</a>. <a>Gary Patterson</a> has coached the team since December 2000, leading the Horned Frogs to a 97-28 record (.776), including six bowl wins in 10 appearances. Under Patterson, the Horned Frogs have owned the No. 1 ranked defense in the country five times (2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010), the most top defenses by any team since the NCAA began keeping records in 1937 (<a>Alabama</a> and <a>Auburn</a> have each had four No. 1 defensive rankings since 1937).</p>
<p>TCU finished the <a>2010 season</a> as the No. 2 ranked team in the AP Poll after beating the <a>Wisconsin Badgers</a> in the <a>2011 Rose Bowl</a>.  The Horned Frogs were the first school from a non-automatic qualifying conference to play in the Rose Bowl since the creation of the <a>Bowl Championship Series</a>.</p>
<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p>The <a>TCU Horned Frogs</a> have an historic rivalry with the <a>SMU Mustangs</a> of Fort Worth's sister city, Dallas.  In football, the teams compete annually in the <a>Battle for the Iron Skillet</a>.  TCU leads the all-time series 41-39-7.</p>
<p>Traditionally, TCU's other biggest rivals have been those teams from the now defunct <a>Southwest Conference</a>, and attempts are made to schedule those schools as out-of-conference opponents.  Most TCU teams play annually or bi-annually with <a>Baylor University</a> and <a>Texas Tech University</a>.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p>TCU has roughly 75,000 living alumni.</p>
