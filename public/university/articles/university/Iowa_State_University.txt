Iowa State has produced astronauts, scientists, and <a>Nobel</a> and <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners, along with a host of other notable individuals in their respective fields. Until 1945 it was known as the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. </p>
<p>Founded in 1858 and <a>coeducational</a> from its start, ISU is <a>classified</a> as a Research University with very high research activity (RU/VH) by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>. The university is a group member of the prestigious <a>American Association of Universities</a>, <a>Universities Research Association</a>, and the <a>Big 12 Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1856, the <a>Iowa General Assembly</a> enacted legislation to establish the State Agricultural College and Model Farm. <a>Story County</a> was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, from proposals by <a>Johnson</a>, <a>Kossuth</a>, <a>Marshall</a>, <a>Polk</a>, and <a>Story</a> counties. When <a>Iowa</a> accepted the provisions of the <a>Morrill Act of 1862</a>, Iowa State became the first institution in the nation designated as a <a>land-grant college</a>. The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and 2 women.&#x0009;  &#x0009; The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features. Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer. Courses in mechanical, civil, electrical, and mining engineering were also taught. &#x0009;  &#x0009;&#x0009;&#x0009; [[File:Fountain of Four Seasons.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Buildings of Iowa State University#Fountain of Four Seasons|Fountain of Four Seasons]] by Christian Petersen with the <a>Campanile</a> in the background]] The domain occupied about 1175 acres (476 hectares), of which 120 acres (49 hectares) formed the campus. In 1914, tuition was free to residents of Iowa. Students from other states paid an annual fee of $50. There were 217 members on the faculty in 1914 when 3,458 students attended the school. In 1923, 7,766 students were taught by a faculty which numbered 567 members. In the period from 1914 to 1923, the following buildings were erected: four women's dormitories, plant propagation building and greenhouse, science building, hospital, armory, animal husbandry laboratory, agricultural engineering building, poultry laboratory, dairy judging pavilion, and sheep, horse, hog, and dairy barns. A library of 250,000 volumes' capacity, a home economics building, and a dormitory for women were under construction in 1924. The president was Raymond Allen Pearson.</p>
<p>The university continues to grow and set a new record for enrollment in the fall of 2010 with 28,685 students.</p>

<h2>Distinctions</h2>
<h3>Birthplace of first electronic digital computer</h3>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Atanasoff&#x2013;Berry Computer replica on 1st floor of Durham Center, Iowa State University.</a> Iowa State is the birthplace of the first electronic digital computer, starting the world&#x2019;s computer technology revolution.  Invented by mathematics and physics professor <a>John Atanasoff</a> and engineering graduate student <a>Clifford Berry</a> during 1939-42, the <a>Atanasoff-Berry Computer</a>, or ABC, pioneered important elements of modern computing, including binary arithmetic, regenerative memory, parallel processing, and electronic switching elements. </p>
<h3>Birth of cooperative extension</h3>
<p>The <a>Extension Service</a> traces its roots to farmers&#x2019; institutes developed at Iowa State in the late 19th century.  Committed to community, Iowa State pioneered the outreach mission of being a land-grant college through creation of the first Extension Service in 1902.  In 1906, the <a>Iowa Legislature</a> enacted the Agricultural Extension Act making funds available for demonstration projects.  It is believed this was the first specific legislation establishing state extension work, for which Iowa State assumed responsibility.  The national extension program was created in 1914 based heavily on the Iowa State model.  </p>
<h3>Manhattan Project</h3>
<p>ISU is the only university nationwide that has a <a>U.S. Department of Energy</a> research laboratory physically located on its campus.  Iowa State played a critical role in the development of the <a>atomic bomb</a> during <a>World War II</a>.  As part of the <a>Manhattan Project</a>, the process to produce large quantities of high-purity uranium metal was developed at Iowa State.  Iowa State provided one-third of the uranium metal used in the world&#x2019;s first controlled nuclear chain reaction, or atomic bomb. </p>
<h2>Colleges</h2>
<p>ISU is organized into eight colleges that offer 96 Bachelors degree programs, 115 Masters programs, 83 Ph.D programs, and one professional degree program in <a>Veterinary Medicine</a>.</p>

<h2>Campus and Landmarks</h2>
<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p> Iowa State's campus contains over 160 buildings. Several buildings, as well as the Marston Water Tower, are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. The central campus includes  of trees, plants, and classically designed buildings.  The landscape's most dominant feature is the  central lawn, which was listed as a &quot;medallion site&quot; by the <a>American Society of Landscape Architects</a> in 1999, one of only three central campuses designated as such. The other two were <a>Yale University</a> and the <a>University of Virginia</a>. </p>
<p>Thomas Gaines, in <em>The Campus As a Work of Art</em>, proclaimed the Iowa State campus to be one of the twenty-five most beautiful campuses in the country.  Gaines noted Iowa State's park-like expanse of central campus, and the use of trees and shrubbery to draw together ISU's varied building architecture.  Over decades, campus buildings, including the Campanile, Beardshear Hall, and Curtiss Hall, circled and preserved the central lawn, creating a space where students study, relax, and socialize.</p>
<h3>Reiman Gardens</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;The Christina Reiman Butterfly Wing</a> Iowa State has maintained a <a>horticulture</a> <a>garden</a> since 1914. <a>Reiman Gardens</a> is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from <a>Bobbi and Roy Reiman</a>. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial 5 acres (20,000 m2) were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.</p>
<p>Reiman Gardens has since grown to become a 14- acre site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly &quot;wing&quot;, butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of <a>Jack Trice Stadium</a> on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa. </p>
<p>The Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its <a>rose garden</a>s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the <a>United States</a> each year for superior rose maintenance and display: &#x201c;For contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.&#x201d; </p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Iowa State's composting facility &quot;can handle more than 10,000 tons of organic wastes annually.&quot; A new website tracks energy use of campus buildings  and the school's new $3 million dollar revolving loan fund loans money for energy efficiency and conservation projects on campus. In the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B- grade.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|View looking east towards Roberts Hall.</a></p>
<p>Iowa State operates 19 on-campus <a>residence halls</a>. The residence halls are divided into geographical areas. <a>Richardson Court</a> (RCA) consists of 12 residence halls on the east side of campus. The Union Drive Neighborhood (UDA) consists of four residence halls located on the west side of campus, including <a>Friley Hall</a>, which has been declared one of the largest residence halls in the country. Buchanan Hall is an upper-division hall that is nominally considered part of the RCA, despite its distance from the other buildings. The <a>Towers Residence Halls</a> (TRA) are located south of the main campus. Like Buchanan, they are reserved for second-year students and upperclassmen. Two of the four towers, Knapp and Storms Halls, were imploded in 2005; however, Wallace and Wilson Halls still stand. ISU also operates two apartment complexes for upperclassmen, <a>Frederiksen Court</a> and <a>SUV Apartments</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>The governing body for ISU students is the Government of Student Body or GSB. The GSB is composed of a president, vice president, finance director, cabinet appointed by the president, a clerk appointed by the vice president, senators representing each college and residence area at the university, a nine-member judicial branch and an election commission.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>ISU has over 800 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests. Organizations are supported by Iowa State's Student Activities Center. Many student organization offices are housed in the <a>Memorial Union</a>.</p>
<h3>Greek community</h3>
<p>ISU is home to an active <a>Greek community</a>. There are 50 chapters that involve 11 percent of undergraduate students. Collectively, <a>fraternity</a> and <a>sorority</a> members have raised over $82,000 for philanthropies and committed 31,416 hours to community service. In 2006, the ISU Greek community was named the best large Greek community in the <a>Midwest</a>.</p>
<p>The ISU Greek Community has received multiple Jellison and Sutherland Awards from Association for Fraternal Leadership and Values, formerly the Mid-American Greek Council Association. These awards recognize the top Greek Communities in the Midwest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first fraternity, <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, was established at Iowa State in 1875, six years after the first graduating class entered Iowa State. The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, was established only two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in <em><a>The Des Moines Register</a></em>, &quot;The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o'clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to break up a joint meeting of three secret societies.&quot; In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventually closing of all formerly established fraternities. President Storms lifted the ban in 1904.</p>
<p>Following the lifting of the fraternity ban, the first twelve national fraternities (IFC) installed on the Iowa State campus between 1904 and 1913 were, in order, <a>Sigma Nu</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, <a>Beta Theta Pi</a>, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a>, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, <a>Theta Xi</a>, <a>Acacia</a>, <a>Phi Sigma Kappa</a>, <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, and <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>. Though some have suspended their chapters at various times, ten of the original twelve fraternities are active in 2008. Many of these chapters existed on campus as local fraternities before being reorganized as national fraternities, prior to 1904.</p>
<h3>School newspaper</h3>
<p> The <em><a>Iowa State Daily</a></em> is the university's student newspaper and is the nation's largest student run newspaper. The <em>Daily</em> has its roots from a news sheet titled the <em>Clipper</em>, which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The <em>Clipper</em> soon led to the creation of the <em>Iowa Agricultural College Student</em>, and the beginnings of what would one day become the <em>Iowa State Daily</em>.</p>
<h3>Campus radio</h3>
<p> 88.5 KURE is the university's student-run radio station. Programming for KURE includes ISU sports coverage, talk shows, the annual quiz contest Kaleidoquiz, and various music genres.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>200px|right|Iowa State Cyclones logo</a>  The <a>&quot;Cyclones&quot;</a> name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as <a>tornado</a>es were called at the time). In September, the Iowa State football team traveled to <a>Northwestern University</a> and defeated its highly-regarded team by a score of 36-0. The next day, the <em><a>Chicago Tribune</a><strong>s headline read &quot;Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.&quot; The article reported that &quot;Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.&quot; The nickname stuck and the Iowa State team had made a name for itself. </strong></em></p>
<p>The school colors are <a>cardinal</a> and <a>gold</a>. The mascot is <a>Cy the Cardinal</a>, introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner. In early Summer 2007, Cy was voted by fans on the <a>CBS Sports</a> website as the &quot;Most Dominant College Mascot on Earth&quot;.  In 2009, Cy won the <a>Capital One</a> Mascot competition. </p>
<p>The Iowa State Cyclones compete in 18 varsity sports in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I-A</a> as a member of the <a>Big 12 Conference</a>. In club hockey, the Cyclones compete in and are a founding member of the <a>Central States Collegiate Hockey League</a> of the <a>American Collegiate Hockey Association</a>.  Iowa State teams and individuals have achieved great success, including national championships in wrestling, gymnastics, and cross country.</p>
<p>Iowa State's intrastate <a>archrival</a> is the <a>University of Iowa</a> whom it competes annually for the <a>Hy-Vee Cy-Hawk Series</a> trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools. Sponsored by <a>Hy-Vee</a>, the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions between the two rival universities in all sports. </p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> [[File:Jack Trice Stadium, daytime.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ISU marching band providing pre-game entertainment at [[Jack Trice Stadium]].]] Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it was not until 1892 that Iowa State organized its first team to represent the school in football.  In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams.  The 1894 team finished with a 6-1 mark, including a 16-8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa.  The Cyclones compete annually for two trophies.  Since 1977, Iowa State and Iowa compete each year for the <a>Cy-Hawk Trophy</a>.  Iowa State competes with conference rival <a>Missouri</a> for the <a>Telephone Trophy</a>.</p>
<p>The Cyclones play its home games at <a>Jack Trice Stadium</a>, named after <a>Jack Trice</a>, ISU's first <a>African-American</a> athlete and also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition.  Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against <a>Minnesota</a> in <a>Minneapolis</a> on October 6, 1923.  Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players.  It is disputed whether he was trampled purposely or if it was by accident.  The stadium was named in his honor in 1997 and is the only NCAA Division I-A stadium named after an African-American. Jack Trice Stadium, formerly known as Cyclone Stadium, opened on September 20, 1975, with a win against the <a>Air Force Academy</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning with its first appearance in the 1971 <a>Sun Bowl</a>, the Cyclones have earned ten trips to <a>bowl</a> games.  In its most recent bowl, Iowa State defeated Minnesota in the 2009 <a>Insight Bowl</a>, 14-13, in <a>Tempe</a>, <a>Arizona</a>.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball</h3>
<p> Hopes of &quot;Hilton Magic&quot; returning took a boost with the hiring of ISU alum and fan favorite <a>Fred Hoiberg</a> as coach of the men's basketball team in April 2010.  Hoiberg played three seasons under legendary coach <a>Johnny Orr</a> and one season under future <a>Chicago Bulls</a> coach <a>Tim Floyd</a> during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991&#x2013;95).   Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from <a>Michigan</a> in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including <a>Kelvin Cato</a>, <a>Jeff Grayer</a>, <a>Barry Stevens</a>, and walk-on <a>Jeff Hornacek</a>.  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the <a>Big Eight</a> and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed  <a>Michigan</a> in the second round of the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>Under coaches Floyd (1995&#x2013;98) and <a>Larry Eustachy</a> (1998&#x2013;2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive Big 12 regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000&#x2013;01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated <a>UCLA</a> in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to <a>Michigan State</a>, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the <a>Spartans</a>' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout <a>Marcus Fizer</a> and <a>Jamaal Tinsley</a> were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32-5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed <a>Hampton</a> in the first round.</p>
<p>Of Iowa State's 13 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen four times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball</h3>
<p> Iowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.  Since the founding of the Big 12, Coach <a>Bill Fennelly</a> and the Cyclones have won three  conference titles (one regular season, two tournament), and have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen five times (1999-2001, 2009, 2010) and the Elite Eight twice (1999, 2009) in the NCAA Tournament.  The team is also a leader in attendance, finishing third in the nation in both 2009 and 2010.</p>
<h3>Wrestling</h3>
<p> The storied wrestling program has captured the NCAA wrestling tournament title eight times between 1928 and 1987, and won the Big 12 Conference Tournament three consecutive years, 2007-2009.  On February 7, 2010, the Cyclones became the first collegiate wrestling program to record its 1,000th dual win in program history by defeating <a>Arizona State</a>, 30-10, in Tempe, Arizona.  </p>
<p>In 2002, under Coach <a>Bobby Douglas</a>, Iowa State became the first school to produce a four-time, undefeated NCAA champion in <a>Cael Sanderson</a>, who also took the gold medal at the 2004 <a>Olympic Games</a> in <a>Athens</a>, <a>Greece</a>.  <a>Dan Gable</a>, another legendary ISU wrestler, is famous for having lost only one match in his entire Iowa State collegiate career - his last, and winning gold at the 1972 Olympics in <a>Munich</a>, <a>Germany</a>, while not giving up a single point.  </p>
<p>In 2013, Iowa State will host its eighth NCAA Wrestling Championships.  The Cyclones hosted the first NCAA championships in 1928.</p>
<h3>Volleyball</h3>
<p>In volleyball, Coach Christy Johnson-Lynch has led the Cyclones to four NCAA tournament appearances since her Iowa State arrival in 2005, including two Sweet Sixteen appearances and an Elite Eight.  In 2009, Iowa State finished the season second in the Big 12 behind <a>Texas</a> with a 27-5 record and ranked #6, its highest ever finish.</p>
<h2>VEISHEA celebration</h2>
<p>[[Image:VEISHEA2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[VEISHEA]] 2006 Battle of the Bands.]]  Iowa State is widely known for <a>VEISHEA</a>, an annual education and entertainment festival held on campus each spring. The name VEISHEA is derived from the initials of ISU's five original colleges, forming an acronym as the university existed when the festival was founded in 1922:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>V</strong>eterinary Medicine</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong>ngineering</li>
  <li><strong>I</strong>ndustrial <strong>S</strong>cience</li>
  <li><strong>H</strong>ome <strong>E</strong>conomics</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>griculture</li>
</ul>
<p>VEISHEA is the largest student run festival in the nation, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors to the campus each year. The celebration features an annual parade and many open-house demonstrations of the university facilities and departments. Campus organizations exhibit products, technologies, and hold fund raisers for various charity groups. In addition, VEISHEA brings speakers, lecturers, and entertainers to Iowa State, and throughout its over eight decade history, it has hosted such distinguished guests as <a>Bob Hope</a>, <a>John Wayne</a>, Presidents <a>Harry Truman</a>, <a>Ronald Reagan</a>, and <a>Lyndon Johnson</a>, and performers <a>Diana Ross</a>, <a>Billy Joel</a>, <a>Sonny and Cher</a>, <a>The Who</a>, The <a>Goo Goo Dolls</a>, <a>Bobby V</a>, and <a>The Black Eyed Peas</a>. </p>
<p>The 2007 VEISHEA festivities marked the start of Iowa State's year-long <a>sesquicentennial</a> celebration.</p>
