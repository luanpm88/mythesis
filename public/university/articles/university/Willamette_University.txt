The name was changed to Wallamet University in 1852, followed by the current spelling in 1870. Willamette founded the first medical school and law school in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a> in the second half of the 19th century. In the 20th century, the school started a <a>sister school</a> relationship with <a>Tokyo International University of America</a> and began competing in intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<p>Willamette's undergraduate programs exist within the school's College of Liberal Arts. The school was rated 59th among American liberal arts colleges by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> in 2009. The oldest of the graduate programs is the <a>College of Law</a>, founded in 1883 and currently located in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center. Established in 1974, <a>Atkinson Graduate School of Management</a> is housed in the Seeley G. Mudd Building. The <a>School of Education</a>, established in 1996, has an enrollment of 250 students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded as the <a>Oregon Institute</a> by the missionary <a>Jason Lee</a>, who had arrived in what was then known as the <a>Oregon Country</a> in 1834 and had founded the Indian Manual Labor Institute for the education of the local <a>Native Americans</a>. Lee requested additional support for his mission, and received 53 additional volunteers in 1839, who arrived on the ship <em><a>Lausanne</a></em>. After a series of meetings in Lee's home, the by-laws were adopted and board of trustees elected and the institute was officially established on February 1, 1842. Lee served as the first President of the Board of Trustees, followed by <a>David Leslie</a> after Lee&#x2019;s death in 1845. Leslie would serve until his death in 1869. The original purpose of the institute was the education of the missionaries' children.</p>
<p>[[File:Eaton Hall from OSC.JPG|left|thumb|[[Eaton Hall (Oregon)|Eaton Hall]] built in 1909]] The original building of the institute was a three-story frame structure first occupied in 1844. At the time, it was one of the largest structures in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a>. It housed the first session of the state legislature to meet in <a>Salem</a> after the capital was moved there in 1851. The building burned down in 1877. In 1867, a new brick building was finished to house the school and named University Hall.</p>
<p>The name of institution was changed to &quot;Wallamet University&quot; in 1852. The following year, the <a>Oregon Territorial Legislature</a> granted a charter to the university. The first graduate was Emily W. York, in 1859. In 1866, the university established the first <a>school of medicine</a> in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a>. The current spelling of the university was adopted in 1870. In 1883, the university established the first <a>law school</a> in the Pacific Northwest during the presidency of <a>Thomas Van Scoy</a>. The school of medicine then merged with the <a>University of Oregon</a> in 1913 and is now <a>Oregon Health and Sciences University</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1941, the university's football team traveled to <a>Hawaii</a> to play the <a>University of Hawaii</a>. Many students accompanied the team by passenger ship to <a>Oahu</a>. The game was played was on December 6. The following day, many of the Willamette students witnessed the bombing of <a>Pearl Harbor</a> from their hotels on <a>Waikiki Beach</a>.  Their return trip was delayed by many weeks, and some of the students had to return to the mainland by troop transport ships. Many of the team members stayed with football players from <a>Punahou School</a>.  The incident has since become part of the folklore of the university.</p>
<p>In 1983, <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> named Willamette the best small comprehensive university in the Western United States. Willamette was one of the last universities in the nation to hold an annual singing and marching competition between the undergraduate classes. The competition, known on campus as &quot;Glee,&quot; was held each March. In the late 1990s, the competition came to be regarded as anachronistic and was abolished. Glee returned during the 2006 to 2007 academic year. Additional school properties outside of the core area are the <a>Hallie Ford Museum of Art</a>, the <a>Oregon Civic Justice Center</a>, the Tokyo International University of America campus, and several residential buildings. These plans include adding a performing arts center. and Rogers Music Center have all been designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. Ford Hall, near <a>Gatke Hall</a> on State Street, is a new academic building completed in the Fall of 2009.</p>
<p>In addition to Greek housing, eleven residence halls exist on the Willamette campus. Undergraduate students are under contract to live on campus for two years, after which they may move into private residence or one of the university's apartment complexes. <a>Lausanne Hall</a>, originally home of the university's Women's College, is now one of the university's undergraduate dormitories. The building commemorates the ship that brought the reinforcements to Lee in 1839. York Hall commemorates the university's first graduate. <a>thumb|left|Hudson's Bay and the Mill Race that runs through campus</a> A stream runs through the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the <a>Martha Springer Botanical Garden</a>, the <a>Hatfield Library</a>, Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This artificial stream is named the Mill Race, although it is commonly referred to as &quot;the Mill Stream.&quot; It forms a &quot;W&quot; shape when viewed from the University Center. Also from this vantage point one can view &quot;the impossible triangle,&quot; a metal structure erected at the suggestion of a physics professor, M. B Stewart. As a tradition, undergraduate students are thrown into the Mill Stream on their birthday. Biology and environmental science classes utilize the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream and watch it float downstream.</p>
<p>On campus athletics facilities are located in the southeast portion of the campus. These include a soccer field, tennis courts, and the Sparks Center.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>College of Liberal Arts</h3>
<p>The mission of the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) is to &quot;maintain a setting which encourages and sustains students and faculty in the practices of liberal education.&quot; The undergraduate program is able to be personal with a student-faculty ratio of 10:1. Students conduct original research, publish papers and are able to design their own academic paths.</p>
<p>The CLA offers 35 majors, six minors and seven special programs, including pre-law, pre-med and a BA/MBA program. The most popular areas of study are economics, psychology, politics, English and biology, and learning takes place both in and outside of the classroom. For example, students earn credit as political interns at the <a>Oregon State Capitol</a>, across the street from campus; study the effects of climate change at the nearby research forest; or conduct epidemiology surveys for the local health department. </p>
<p>Students in service-learning courses base papers and projects on their community service experience, and more than half of Willamette&#x2019;s undergraduate students study abroad, choosing from programs in 40 countries. Co-located with <a>Tokyo International University of America</a>, Willamette offers opportunities for students interested in Japanese language and culture, and connections to Asia and the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>Carson Grants offer undergraduates the opportunity to undertake a scholarly, creative or professional research project during the summer, and the <a>Lilly</a> Project provides grants, internships and programs to help students discern their &#x201c;calling in life&#x201d; and create meaningful professional paths. Sustainability mini-grants also provide students with opportunities to initiate contributions to campus sustainability efforts. Five academic Centers of Excellence provide opportunities for student-faculty collaboration and research.  </p>
<p>Ten faculty members have been named Oregon Professor of the Year by the <a>Council for Advancement and Support of Education</a> (CASE) since 1990. The U.S. Professors of the Year program recognizes educators who demonstrate an extraordinary dedication to undergraduate teaching through, &quot;impact on and involvement with undergraduate students; scholarly approach to teaching and learning; contribution to undergraduate education in the institution, community and profession; and support from colleagues and current and former undergraduate students.&quot; The 2008 <a>Princeton Review</a> described Willamette as &#x201c;academically rigorous, intimate and seriously gorgeous,&#x201d; and the school ranked fifth in [[Seattle Metropolitan]]&#x2019;s Northwest college rankings. The magazine cited the school&#x2019;s alumni roster, wireless features, &#x201c;outdoorsy aesthetic&#x201d; and new residence hall. As of 2009, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranks the university as the 60th best among liberal arts schools in their annual Best Colleges edition.</pre>
<h3>Graduate programs</h3>
<p> Located on the western side of the campus are the university's three graduate level schools. The College of Law is the oldest and largest of the three programs, with the School of Education as the smallest and newest program. Atkinson and the College of Law offer a joint-degree program that allows students to earn both an <a>MBA</a> and <a>juris doctorate</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Jackson Plaza outside the library</a> The university's weekly newspaper, the <em><a>Willamette Collegian</a></em>, began publishing in 1875. The school has over 100 student organizations ranging from sport clubs, political groups, and social clubs to religious groups and honor societies. Willamette University has many active clubs sports on its campus. These include, but are not limited to rugby, lacrosse, crew, and ultimate Frisbee.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>There are four fraternities and three sororities at Willamette. The sororities are <a>Delta Gamma</a>, <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>, and <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a>. Each has its own house located along sorority row on Mill Street. The fraternities at Willamette are <a>Beta Theta Pi</a>, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, and <a>Sigma Chi</a>. The fraternities are housed on the east side of campus. </p>
<p>Greek life at Willamette began in the 1920s with the foundation of several local fraternities and sororities. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a Beta, became President of Willamette, and invited national fraternities and sororities onto campus. The local fraternities were soon converted into national fraternities and sororities. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947. At its peak, there were six fraternities and five sororities at Willamette.</p>
<p>Two other sororities, <a>Chi Omega</a> and <a>Alpha Phi</a>, and two fraternities, <a>Kappa Sigma</a> and <a>Delta Tau Delta</a> used to have chapters at Willamette. In 2006, Kappa Sigma lost its charter.  In the mid-1990s, Delta Tau Delta lost its charter. The two sororities lost their charters after their move to sorority row. Their on-campus houses are now general residences. Chi Omega was transformed into a multicultural oriented residence known as WISH (Willamette International Studies House). Alpha Phi was remade into a substance-free mixed gender dormitory called Shepard House.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been several efforts to create a new fraternity on campus. In 2007, students attempted to restart Delta Tau Delta. While the students were recognized as a colony by the fraternity, they disbanded in 2009. Also in 2009, students started a Kappa Sigma interest group. If successful, the Kappa Sigma interest group will become an official colony in 2011.</p>
