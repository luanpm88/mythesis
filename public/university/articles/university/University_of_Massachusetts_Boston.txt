<p> <strong>The University of Massachusetts Boston</strong>, also known as <strong>UMass Boston</strong>, is an urban public research university and the second largest campus in the five-campus <a>University of Massachusetts</a> system. The university is located on  on <a>Harbor Point</a> in the City of <a>Boston</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>. Students are primarily from Massachusetts but also from other parts of the United States and from foreign countries.</p>
<p>UMass Boston is the only public university in the city of Boston.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Massachusetts at Boston was established in 1964, when the state legislature voted to establish a new university campus in Boston. The official Founding Day Convocation and ceremony was held on December 10, 1966 in the <a>Prudential Tower</a> in Boston and inaugurated UMass Boston as an official institution of higher learning and formally installed the first Chancellor of the university, <a>John W. Ryan</a>. It is part of the <a>Greater Boston Urban Education Collaborative</a>, but over time was absorbed and merged with other schools, such as <a>Boston State College</a>, absorbed in 1982, and which dates back to 1852.</p>
<p>In 1974, it opened its location on the <a>Columbia Point</a> peninsula on <a>Dorchester</a> Bay. The university originally occupied five buildings: McCormack and Wheatley halls, the Science Center, Healey Library, and the Quinn Administration Building.</p>
<p>The original Harbor Campus buildings were said to have had sparse and very unattractive interiors, with odd mazes of hallways; the campus was known as &quot;the fortress&quot; or &quot;the prison&quot; colloquially. They were rumored to have been designed by architects who were primarily familiar with prisons, although, in point of fact, the library had been designed by the distinguished Chicago modernist architect, <a>Harry Mohr Weese</a>. At one point in his career,  Weese had  designed the <a>Metropolitan Correction Center in Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The contracting of the construction of the new Harbor Campus had resulted in a huge scandal.</p>
<p>The Clark Athletic Center was added later, including an ice hockey arena, swimming pool, and basketball courts. It also hosted the first presidential debate between then Texas Governor <a>George W. Bush</a> and Vice President <a>Al Gore</a> in 2000. The cancellation of two days of classes in order to create security for the debate resulted in a large protest by UMB students, faculty and staff members outside of the UMass President's office in downtown Boston.</p>
<p>In 2004 a new Campus Center was opened, designed by the Boston-based architectural firm of Kallmann McKinnell &amp; Wood  and built by Suffolk Construction at a cost of $80 million. It houses offices, restaurants in a food court, event space, student clubs and activities. It also serves as the new entrance for the campus and was the first major building put up since the original Harbor Campus was built in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The original buildings fell into disrepair, and there are plans for replacement. Allegations of shoddy construction surfaced again in 2006 when the underground parking garage had to be closed because it had become structurally unsound. All parking is now outdoors, except for the Campus Center garage.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2006, <a>Barack Obama</a> addressed his commencement speech at UMass Boston to the graduating students. In his speech he talked about several things including his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2007, the university proposed a plan to change the nature of the campus from primarily a commuter campus with many parking lots for cars to a more residential campus with dormitory style living.</p>
<p>The current chancellor of the University, J. Keith Motley, is the first African-American chancellor in the university's history.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Bayside Expo Center property, close to the campus, was lost in a foreclosure on Corcoran-Jennison to a Florida-based real estate firm, LNR/CMAT, who bought it. Soon after, the University of Massachusetts Boston bought the property from them to build future campus facilities.</p>

<h2>In popular culture</h2>
<p>UMass Boston was frequently mentioned in <a>Martin Scorsese</a>'s 2006 crime drama, <em><a>The Departed</a></em>. The exterior of the campus can also be viewed in a scene from the beginning of the film.  A character says that the university is in South Boston, and Mark Wahlberg's character ridicules him for the obvious comment.  However, this is a common error.  UMass Boston is in Dorchester.</p>
