President <a>Jiang Zemin</a> paid two visits to the university and wrote the following inscription as praise and encouragement to the staff and students: &#x201c;The mission is demanding and the journey ahead is long.&#x201d; Other leaders of the Central Government have also visited the university.

<h2>History</h2>
