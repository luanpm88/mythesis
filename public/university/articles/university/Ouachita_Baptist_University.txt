<p>The first president was Professor J. W. Conger who was elected to the post on June 22, 1886. The OBU Board of Trustees unanimously selected Dr. Rex Horne, former pastor of <a>Immanuel Baptist Church</a> in Little Rock, as the fifteenth president of Ouachita Baptist University on April 6, 2006. Those who have served as president include:  J.W. Conger (1886&#x2013;1907), Henry Simms Hartzog (1907&#x2013;1911), Samuel Young Jameson (1913&#x2013;1916), Charles Ernest Dicken (1916&#x2013;1926), Arthur B. Hill (1926&#x2013;1929), Charles D.
