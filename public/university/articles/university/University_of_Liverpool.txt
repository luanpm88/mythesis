<p>  </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Liverpool</strong> is a teaching and research <a>university</a> in the city of <a>Liverpool</a>, <a>England</a>. It is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of large research-intensive universities and the <a>N8 Group</a> for research collaboration. Founded in 1881 (as a <a>University College</a>) it is also one of the six original &quot;<a>red brick</a>&quot; civic universities. The university has produced eight <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners and offers more than 230 first degree courses across 103 subjects. It has an annual turnover of &#x00a3;340 million, including &#x00a3;123 million for research.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Engineeringbuildingwikiliverpoolvictoria.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;[[Red brick university|Red brick]]&quot; <a>Victoria Building</a>]]</p>
<p>The University was established in 1881 as <strong>University College Liverpool</strong>, admitting its first students in 1882.  In 1884, it became part of the federal <a>Victoria University</a>. In 1894 <a>Oliver Lodge</a>, a professor at the University, made the world's first public <a>radio transmission</a> and two years later took the first surgical <a>X-ray</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>. The <a>Liverpool University Press</a> was founded in <a>1899</a>, making it the third oldest <a>university press</a> in <a>England</a>. Students in this period were awarded external degrees by the <a>University of London</a>.</p>
<p>Following a <a>Royal Charter</a> and <a>Act of Parliament</a> in 1903, it became an independent university with the right to confer its own degrees called the <strong>University of Liverpool</strong>. The next few years saw major developments at the university, including <a>Sir</a> <a>Charles Sherrington</a>'s discovery of the <a>synapse</a> and Professor William Blair-Bell's work on <a>chemotherapy</a> in the treatment of <a>cancer</a>. In the 1930s to 1940s Professors <a>Sir</a> <a>James Chadwick</a> and <a>Sir</a> <a>Joseph Rotblat</a> made major contributions to the development of the <a>atomic bomb</a>. From 1943 - 1966 <a>Allan Downie</a>, Professor of Bacteriology, was involved in the eradication of <a>smallpox</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994 the university was a founding member of the <a>Russell Group</a>, a collaboration of twenty leading research-intensive universities, as well as a founding member of the <a>N8 Group</a> in 2004. In the 21st century physicists, engineers and technicians from the University of Liverpool were involved in the construction of the <a>Large Hadron Collider</a> at <a>CERN</a>, working on two of the four detectors in the LHC.</p>
<p>The University has produced nine <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners, from the fields of <a>science</a>, <a>medicine</a> and <a>peace</a>. The Nobel laureates include the physician <a>Sir Ronald Ross</a>, physicist <a>Professor Charles Barkla</a>, the physiologist <a>Sir Charles Sherrington</a>, physicist <a>Sir James Chadwick</a>, chemist <a>Sir Robert Robinson</a>, physiologist <a>Professor Har Gobind Khorana</a>, physiologist <a>Professor Rodney Porter</a>, physicist <a>Professor Joseph Rotblat</a> and ecological economist <a>Dr Pushpam Kumar</a>. <a>Sir Ronald Ross</a> was also the first British Nobel laureate in 1902.</p>
<p>The term &quot;<a>red brick</a>&quot; was first coined by Liverpool professor <a>Edgar Allison Peers</a> (writing as Bruce Truscot) to describe the red brick built civic universities that were built in the UK, mostly in the latter part of the 19th century; these were characterised by Victorian buildings of red brick, such as <a>Victoria Building</a>, which was historically the administrative heart of the University.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p><a>thumb|University of Liverpool</a></p>
<p>Liverpool has the sixth largest <a>financial endowment</a> of any UK university, valued at &#x00a3;110m, according to the Sutton Trust.  It is a member of the <a>Russell Group of Universities</a> and a founding member of the <a>Northern Consortium</a>. The University has over 23,000 registered students, with almost 18,000 full-time registered students. The University has a broad range of teaching and research in both arts and sciences, and has a large medical school, which is associated with the neighbouring <a>Royal Liverpool University Hospital</a>. In September 2008, Sir <a>Howard Newby</a> took up the post of Vice-Chancellor of the University, following the retirement of Sir <a>James Drummond Bone</a>.</p>
<p>The University has a <a>Students' union</a> to represent students' interests, known as the <a>Liverpool Guild of Students</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that whilst Liverpool has a total of five universities, the colloquial term <em>Liverpool University</em> commonly refers to the University of Liverpool rather than either of the other four, <a>Liverpool Hope University</a>, <a>Liverpool John Moores University</a>, Edge Hill University, or LIPA.</p>
<h2>Campus and facilities</h2>
<p>The University is mainly based around a single urban campus approximately five minutes walk from Liverpool City Centre, at the top of Brownlow Hill and Mount Pleasant. The main site is divided into three faculties: Health and Life Sciences; Humanities and Social Sciences; and Science and Engineering. The Veterinary Teaching Hospital (Leahurst) and Ness Botanical Gardens are based on the <a>Wirral Peninsula</a>. There was formerly a research station at <a>Port Erin</a> on the <a>Isle of Man</a> until it closed in 2006. The <a>Johnston Laboratories</a>, a pathology research facility of repute during much of the 20th century, is now the biochemistry department of the university.</p>
<h3>Harold Cohen Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Harold Cohen Library</a> The Harold Cohen Library is the main library for science, engineering and medical, dental and veterinary sciences. It also contains eight computer centres as well as the Wolfson training suite.</p>
<h3>Sydney Jones Library</h3>
<p>The Sydney Jones Library is the main library for arts and humanities in the University of Liverpool. The library is housed in two buildings, the Grove Wing and the Abercromby Wing (formerly Senate House). The Grove Wing contains the majority of the collection and the special collections. The Abercromby Wing contains the Law Library, the library offices, computer services and the main Service Desk. The two buildings are linked by the Link Building which has the information support desks. <a>thumb|Sydney Jones Library</a></p>
<h3>Liverpool Medical School</h3>
<p>Liverpool Medical School was ranked as the ninth best medical school in the United Kingdom by <em><a>The Times</a> Good University Guide 2008</em>.  One of the key features of the medical programme is <a>Problem-based learning</a> (PBL). This is an educational process that encourages students, working in small groups, to learn through curiosity and to seek out information for themselves. Students have the opportunity to link basic medical science with clinical practice early in the programme, thereby stimulating and maintaining their interest instead of overwhelming it with facts.  Other features of the programme include introduction to clinical and communication skills training, a greater emphasis on learning medicine in the community and early patient contact. However, a recent study published on the pass rates of medical school graduates in MRCP postgraduate exams has shown Liverpool graduates to be the least likely to pass amongst all other UK medical schools, even after controlling for pre-admission variability of medical school entrants. The Medical School offers a five-year undergraduate course, and a four-graduate entry course. The Medical School also has one of the oldest student societies - Liverpool Medical Students' Society. LMSS in fact pre-dates the University in its conception from when simply a teaching hospital existed around which the University was built. As of 2008 the medical school accepts some 268 home students per year and a further 24 from overseas making it one of the larger medical schools in the UK . The medical school also hosts the most successful medical school hockey team in recent history (LMSHC) as it is the only team to have won back-to-back NAMS tournament titles (2008&#x2013;09) and Cannock titles (2007&#x2013;2008). Of particular note is the season of 2008/09 where they dominated all domestic leagues and trophies.</p>
<h3>Liverpool Dental School</h3>
<p>The Liverpool Dental School is based at the Liverpool Dental Hospital. The Liverpool Dental Programme is based on a <a>Problem-based learning</a>(PBL) system, where small groups of students are given a medical case, and through research are encouraged to learn about the causes and treatments for themselves. The Dental school now hosts the best Operation Techniques suite (Phantom Head) in the world, until a similar suite based on its design, but twice its size, is finished in the USA.</p>
<p>The Dental School offers a five-year undergraduate course, and recently the number of dental students at the University has increased due to the introduction of a new graduate entry fast track four-year course. Liverpool Dental School is a member of the <a>Dental Schools Council</a>.</p>
<h3>School of Veterinary Science</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The first veterinary school in the UK to be incorporated into a university, the School's treatment and research facilities are on the main campus and at Leahurst on the Wirral Peninsula, approximately 12 miles outside Liverpool. There are three main teaching hospitals:</p>
<p>The Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital specialises in the areas of <a>gastroenterology</a>, <a>oncology</a>, <a>orthopaedics</a> and <a>neurology</a>. The University's Veterinary Development Campaign is currently in the midst of fund raising to support the installation of the first veterinary <a>MRI</a> Unit in the North of England and a new <a>Radiotherapy</a> Unit.</p>
<p>The Small Animal Teaching Hospital moved to its new home in April 2007: a &#x00a3;9.6 million facility at Leahurst. Facilities include MRI and CT scanning, the Johnson Foundation radiotherapy treatment unit, an operating theatre dedicated to key-hole surgery, and the Hill's Pet Mobility Centre.</p>
<p>The Farm Animal Hospital takes cases from throughout NW England and North Wales for detailed investigation and intensive care treatment.</p>
<p>In 2006 the School was voted no. 1 UK vet school in The Times Good University Guide 2006, awarded 24/24 by the <a>Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a> and in 2005 was cited as &quot;the University with the most satisfied students&quot; by the <a>British Veterinary Association</a> and the <a>Association of Veterinary Students</a>.</p>
<h3>Liverpool Management School</h3>
<p>Although business and management studies have been a key part of the University of Liverpool&#x2019;s provision since the early 1900s, the University of Liverpool Management School (ULMS) was only established in 2002.</p>
<p>ULMS was formed as a result of the merger of existing departments, institutes and units from across the University. Five divisions were formed within the ULMS which represent the following subject areas: Accounting and Finance, e-Business and Operations Management, Economics, Management and Marketing and International Business. ULMS has developed rapidly since it was opened in 2002. ULMS offers a number of general management and specialist degrees at an undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral level.</p>
<p>ULMS has 67 members of academic staff including 17 Professors, 2 Readers, 9 Senior Lecturers and 39 Lecturers. 58% of ULMS staff have an international background; countries represented by ULMS faculty include Canada, Pakistan, Chile, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Ireland, Mexico, Nigeria, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States of America.. <a>The University of Liverpool Management School</a></p>

<h3>Centre for Manx Studies</h3>
<p>The <a>Centre for Manx Studies</a>, located in <a>Douglas, Isle of Man</a>, is also affiliated to the University.</p>
<h3>University accommodation</h3>
<p><a>thumb|University Halls</a> The two main university accommodation complexes are both located in the <a>Mossley Hill</a> district of Liverpool. These both belong to the University, and include the Greenbank and Carnatic complexes. The Greenbank Halls include Derby and Rathbone Hall and Roscoe and Gladstone Hall (commonly known as D&amp;R and R&amp;G respectively). <a>Carnatic Halls</a> is the largest of the University of Liverpool accommodation complexes including 6 halls: Morton House, Lady Mountford House, Dale Hall, McNair Hall, Salisbury Hall and Rankin Hall. Both sites include a range of catered and self-catered accommodation.</p>
<p>Within the main campus, there are three accommodation sites: Mulberry Court, Philharmonic Court and Melville Grove. Mulberry Court is situated between Oxford Street, Mulberry Street, and Mount Pleasant. Melville Grove is on Grove Street and Philharmonic on Catharine Street. These are self-catering halls situated roughly three minutes walk from the Guild of Students, and ten minutes from the city centre. Melville Grove typically accommodates postgraduate students, though undergraduates may also apply for accommodation there. Philharmonic has halls for first year students and flats for postgraduate students with families.</p>
<p>All student rooms in halls have Internet access provided by <a>ResNet</a> which is run by Computing Services. This wired service allows fast downloading, inter/outer hall computer game play and the new addition of <a>FreeWire</a>, offering television via the internet.</p>
<h2>Guild of Students</h2>
<p>[[Image:Guild of Students UoL.jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool Guild of Students]]]]</p>
<p><a>Liverpool Guild of Students</a> is the centre point of activity in student life. It is one of the largest Students' Union buildings in England.  The Guild often features live acts, demonstrations and tours such as the NME Tour.  This has been emphasised by Liverpool's <a>Echo Arena</a> hosting the MTV Music awards, attracting the MTV tour with artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Goldfrapp and Pendulum having played at the Guild in 2008. The Guild also offers a selection of student help activities, and it campaigns to aid students in personal or financial crisis. In addition to this, the Guild is also the host for student media projects. These include internet based Icon Radio run by students and a filmmakers' hub to promote the university. The Guild operates LSMedia, an online newspaper and magazine which replaced the magazine &quot;Sphinx&quot; in 2008.</p>
<h2>Academic reputation</h2>
<p>In the Times Good University Guide 2011, the University of Liverpool was ranked 28th.[29]</p>
<p>In the Complete University Guide 2008, published in <em><a>The Independent</a></em>, the University of Liverpool was ranked 42nd out of 113, based on nine measures, while <em><a>The Times</a></em> Good University Guide 2008 ranked Liverpool 34th out of 113 universities. <em><a>The Sunday Times</a></em> university guide recently ranked the University of Liverpool 27th out of 123.

<p></p>
<h2>Green issues</h2>
<p>In 2008 the University of Liverpool was voted joint seventeenth greenest university in Britain by WWF supported company Green League. This represents an improvement after finishing 55th in the league table the previous year..</p>
<p>The position of the university is determined by point allocation in departments such as Transport, Waste management, sustainable procurement and Emissions amongst other categories; these are then transpired into various awards. Liverpool was awarded the highest achievement possible in Environmental policy, Environmental staff, Environmental audit, Fair trade status, Ethical investment policy and Waste recycled whilst also scoring points in Carbon emissions, Water recycle and Energy source. It is Liverpool&#x2019;s growing ambition to encourage students and staff to proclaim itself as an environmentally friendly university.</p>
<p>Liverpool has led the way amongst UK universities with desktop computer power management; they were the first to develop their own power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions. The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings. The university has also been at the forefront of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment. This software, which makes use of unused computer time for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on. The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of Wake-on-LAN and commercial power management software.</p>
<h2>Sport</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Sports Centre</a> The University of Liverpool has a proud sporting tradition and has many premier teams in a variety of sports. The current sporting project comes under the title of Club Liverpool. This athletic union offers nearly 50 types of sport ranging from football, rugby and cricket to others such as windsurfing, lacrosse and cheerleading. Many of the sports have both male and female teams and most are involved in competition on a national scale. BUCS is the body which organises national university competitions involving 154 institutions in 47 sports. Most sports involve travelling to various locations across the country, mainly on Wednesday afternoons.</p>
<p>Two other prominent competitions are the Christie Championships and the Varsity Cup. The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester. The Varsity Cup is a popular &quot;derby&quot; event between <a>Liverpool John Moores University</a> and the University of Liverpool.</p>
