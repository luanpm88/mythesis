<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was named for a young Scots-Irish immigrant salt trader named Samuel Meharry, who was traveling through the rough terrain of Tennessee when his wagon suddenly slipped off the road and fell into a swamp. Meharry was helped by a family of <a>freedmen</a>, whose names are unknown. This family of freed slaves gave Meharry food and shelter in the night.  The next morning they helped him to recover his wagon.  Meharry is reported to have told the former slave family, &quot;I have no money, but when I can I shall do something for your race.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1875, Samuel Meharry, together with four of his brothers, donated a total of $15,000 to assist with the establishment of a medical department at <a>Central Tennessee College</a>.</p>
<p>Among the second class of graduates was Lorenzo Dow Key, the son of Hillery Wattsworth Key.  Key, together with Braden, was one of the founding members of the Tennessee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, North.  The church had split into Methodist Episcopal Church North and Methodist Episcopal Church South on the issue of slavery and was not reunited until 1939.</p>
<p>In 1900, Central Tennessee College changed its name to <a>Walden University</a> in honor of <a>John Morgan Walden</a>, a bishop of the <a>Methodist Church</a> who had ministered to freedmen. In 1915, the medical department faculty of Walden University received a separate charter as Meharry Medical College.&lt;ref name=TNenc/&gt;  It included the departments of pharmacy and dentistry.  The Medical College remained in its original buildings, and Walden University moved to another campus in Nashville.  Hubbard served as Meharry Medical College's first president until his death in 1921.</p>
