<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|330px|Covered bridge on Messiah College campus</a> Messiah College was founded in 1909 by the Brethren in Christ Church, and was originally called Messiah Bible School and Missionary Training Home.  The school moved from Harrisburg to its current location in Grantham, PA in 1911. In 1921 it became a junior college and changed its name to Messiah Bible School.  By the 1950s the school offered four year college programs; in 1951 it changed its name to Messiah College.  Messiah discontinued its high school program in 1959 and added liberal arts programs during this period.  It was accredited in 1963, and continued to expand its liberal arts programs. In 1968 Messiah College opened its Philadelphia Campus in a unique partnership with Temple University.</p>
<p>In 1964 Messiah College took over the operations of <strong>Upland College</strong> in <a>Upland, California</a>, a Bretheren in Christ Church College that had been operating since the 1920s.  The Upland campus was closed and all operations were consolidated to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Messiah continues to be influenced by its traditions primarily in the <a>Anabaptist</a>, but also the <a>Pietist</a> and Wesleyan <a>holiness movement</a>s.</p>
<p>In 2003, Messiah College's Harrisburg Institute was founded in <a>downtown Harrisburg, PA</a>. Its purpose is to serve as an academic and research center and connect students with the unique needs of an urban environment. The Institute also provides housing for up to 25 students.</p>

<p>Messiah College uses the 4-1-3 academic calendar system where the academic year is divided into Fall, January, and Spring Terms. The January Term, or <a>J-Term</a>, is a three-and-a-half-week period where students can choose to take one or two courses intensively, participate in a cross cultural study program, sign up for the popular Skiing and Snowboarding class, or simply stay home for an extended vacation.</p>

<h2>Spiritual life</h2>
<h3>The Community Covenant</h3>
<p>Students at Messiah College are required to sign a Community Covenant upon entering. The document states that every person is created in the image of God, and that there are certain responsibilities of living in community that must also be assumed in relation to God, others, and his creation.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Community Covenant affirms belief in God and the Bible.  Specifically, the Community Covenant requires commitment to academic integrity, responsible decision making in light of Christian values, and balancing personal freedom with concern for others.  Practically, the Covenant bans both on- and off-campus the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco as well as gambling, profanity, &quot;occult practices&quot;, sexual intercourse outside of marriage, and homosexual behavior.  It also prescribes the avoidance of drunkenness, stealing, and dishonesty. The Covenant also prohibits certain attitudes, such as greed, lust, and jealousy, but allows that these attributes are typically expressed less outwardly.</p>
<p>The text of the Covenant can be found on Messiah College's website.</p>
<h3>Chapel</h3>
<p>The mission of Chapel reads:</p>
<p>:&quot;Chapel at Messiah College is a central expression of our identity as a community of Christians with a deep commitment to spiritual growth and academic excellence.</p>
<p>:In chapel we seek to nurture holistic Christian faith through: :* worship that expresses our faith with a full range of contemporary and traditional form :* teaching that connects God's Word and our world :* community building that affirms our common identity in Christ and celebrates our diversity&quot;</p>
<p>Students are required to attend 24 chapel services each semester.</p>
<p>Each student is required to have twelve common chapels, however the rest of the necessary 24 can be fulfilled through alternate chapels on a variety of different topics ranging from discussion forums to videos to special speakers.</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>Messiah College has, over the years, accumulated a number of traditions. One of the oldest traditions is known as &quot;creeking&quot;.  This tradition started out as a way of congratulating male students who had recently gotten engaged.  The student would be taken to the nearby <a>Yellow Breeches Creek</a> by his friends and thrown in. It is also common for people to be &quot;creeked&quot; on their birthdays. The tradition has been extended to the female population.</p>
<h2>The Compassion Forum</h2>
<p>The <a>Compassion Forum</a> was a question-and-answer session in which CNN commentators <a>Jon Meacham</a> and <a>Campbell Brown</a> as well as select members of the audience posed questions about Faith and Politics to Democratic political candidates <a>Hillary Clinton</a> and <a>Barack Obama</a>. The Forum took place at Messiah College, in <a>Grantham</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a> on April 13, 2008 and was given live national coverage by <a>CNN</a>. The event was organized by the religious organization <a>Faith in Public Life</a>. <a>John McCain</a> was offered an invitation to participate in the event, but declined the invitation, citing a schedule conflict.</p>
<h2>Messiah College in popular culture</h2>
<p>Following the <a>US Justice Department Scandal</a> in which Messiah College alumna <a>Monica Goodling</a> was intimately involved, several members of the media ridiculed Messiah College. <a>Jon Stewart</a> on <a>The Daily Show</a> referred to Messiah as a school &quot;where people have faith that they'll receive a quality education, and yet somehow it never arrives,&quot; and &quot;that everyone in the God business knows is a 'savior school'.  Bill Maher focused his satirical criticism on Goodling's legal education education at <a>Regent University</a>, but also mocked Messiah, calling it &quot;the home of the Fighting Christies.&quot;</p>
