<p>  <strong>National Institute of Technology Calicut</strong> () or <strong>NITC</strong> is a federally funded technical university established by an <a>act</a> of the <a>Indian Parliament</a>, located at <a>Kattangal</a> in <a>Chathamangalam</a> which is situated about 22&nbsp;km north-east of <a>Kozhikode</a> (<a>Calicut</a>) City in <a>Kerala</a>, <a>India</a>. It was formerly known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC). NITC is one of the twenty <a>National Institutes of Technology</a> - one in each major state of India - established by the <a>Government of India</a> for fostering national integration by imparting technical education to students from all over the country. NITC is among the very few institutions in the country to boast a <a>Supercomputer</a> of its own.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Initial Years</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|270px|The Administrative Block</a></p>
<p><strong>NITC</strong> was set up in <a>1961</a> as <a>Regional Engineering College</a>, <a>Calicut</a> (CREC) as the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the <a>Third Five Year Plan</a> period. Till the formation of the <a>Calicut University</a> in 1963 the institute was affiliated with the <a>Kerala University</a>. It was largely due to the efforts of <a>Pattom Thanu Pillai</a>, then Chief Minister of Kerala that the institute came into being. Prof.S.Rajaraman, former principal of <a>Government Engineering College, Thrissur</a> was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college till Dr. M. V. Keasva Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, Calicut before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the under-graduate courses, in a campus of .</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|190px|Lecture Hall</a></p>
<p>The intake for the undergraduate courses was increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968-69 on account of industrial recession.</p>
<p>After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as Principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started with a view to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of <a>Information Technology</a> as early as 1984 with the commissioning of multi user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence and new postgraduate were started and the <a>CEDTI</a> was established in the campus the following year. In 1990 <a>Shankar Dayal Sharma</a> inaugurated the <a>Architecture</a> Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The <a>Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode</a> functioned from the NIT Calicut campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in <a>Kunnamangalam</a> in 2003.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|Aerial view of the Electronics Lecture Hall Complex (ELHC) at NITC.</a> <a>The Ministry of Human Resource Development</a>, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the <a>World Bank</a> funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate <a>B.Tech</a> through the <a>All India Engineering Entrance Exam</a>. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut has been declared an Institute of National Importance. The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate program to 570.</p>
