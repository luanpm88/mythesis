<h2>History</h2>
<p>McNeese State University was founded in 1939 as a division of <a>Louisiana State University</a> and was originally called <em>Lake Charles Junior College</em>. It offered only the first two years of higher education. McNeese opened its doors in on an  tract donated by the <a>Calcasieu Parish Police Jury</a> with a physical plant of two buildings: the former Administration Building (Kaufman Hall) and the <a>McNeese Arena</a> (Ralph O. Ward Memorial Gym). The auditorium, now Francis G. Bulber Auditorium, was completed in 1940 as the third building on the campus. These three buildings are still in use today. The name became John McNeese Junior College in 1940 by resolution of the University Board of Supervisors in honor of this pioneer educator of Lake Charles.</p>
<p>The college advanced to four-year status and separated from <a>Louisiana State University</a> in 1950 and was renamed McNeese State College. Its administration was transferred to the Louisiana State Board of Education. The Legislature authorized McNeese to offer curricula leading to the master's degree in 1960, and to the degree of <a>Educational Specialist</a> in 1966. In 1970 its name changed to McNeese State University. McNeese was first accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1954.</p>
