<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:2009-0522-Concordia-OldMain.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Old Main, constructed in 1906, is the fourth oldest building on campus and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]</p>
<p>Concordia College was dedicated Oct. 31, 1891, by some of the first Norwegian settlers to the Red River Valley region of the U.S. (North Dakota and Minnesota). Twenty-one students graduated June 7, 1893, during the college's first Commencement. A complete liberal arts college was then formally organized in 1913.  From the beginning Concordia has been closely allied with the Lutheran Church.  Today, it is one of 27 colleges and universities associated with the ELCA. Concordia College's mission is to &quot;influence the affairs of the world by sending into society thoughtful and informed men and women dedicated to the Christian life.&quot; There is a sculpture by the regionally distinctive sculptor <a>Paul Granlund</a> in the library.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>There are 24 departments including 78 majors. <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Music</a> degrees are offered.  There are also 12 pre-professional programs (including medicine, law, engineering, and dentistry).  </p>
<p>Concordia is ranked among the top 10 U.S. liberal arts colleges for the number of students who gain global experience abroad.

<p>Former Cobber athlete and football coach <a>Jim Christopherson</a> was inducted in the National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Christopherson coached the Cobbers for 32 season from 1969&#x2013;2000 and compiled a record of 218-101-7. He guided the Cobbers to two NAIA National Championships (1978 &amp; 1981), and won 11 MIAC Conference Titles during his tenure. When Christopherson retired in 2000 he was third in wins among active NCAA Division III coaches. He was among an elite group of coaches who have coached for over 30 years at the same school. Christopherson, who played for the <a>Minnesota Vikings</a> for two seasons, is the first player or coach from Concordia College to receive the college's games highest honor. Christopherson coached 16 All-Americans during his time at Concordia and produced over 120 athletes that were named to the MIAC All-Conference Team, including his son Reid.</p>
<p>The football team plays out of Jake Christiansen Stadium, built in 1966 with a capacity of 7,000.  The stadium was named for former coach, Jake Christiansen, who led the Cobber football teams to victory with only one losing season in his 28 years. In 1983 an eight-lane all-weather track was added for track and field events, and it was the site of the 2003 MIAC Men's and Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship Meet. </p>
<p>Concordia's mascot is Kernel the Cobber.  The history given on the school's official website is: &quot;Swedish students at Hope Academy, another institution in Moorhead at the time, developed a taunting cheer - in mock Norwegian -about Concordia students during the early years, playing off of Concordia's location near fields of corn:</p>
<p>&quot;Corncobs! Corncobs! Hva' ska' di ha? (What will they have?) Lutefisk og lefse! (Lutefisk and Lefse) Ya! Ya! Ya!&quot; (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)</p>
<p>&quot;Corncobs&quot; gradually became &quot;Corncobbers&quot; and then &quot;Cobbers&quot; as Concordia students decided to embrace, rather than avoid, the term. Today, students and alumni call themselves &quot;Cobbers.&quot;</p>
<h2>May Seminars</h2>
<p>Many departments including Math, History, Music, Business, Biology, French, Political Science, Russian, Theatre, Sociology, Spanish, Education and Family &amp; Nutritional Sciences offer May Seminars.  In providing the opportunity to travel abroad and visit locations of true scholarly importance, the May Seminar programs seek to bring students closer to the things they study in class.  May seminars begin at the end of the spring semester and typically last four weeks.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|<em>Come to the Living Water</em>, the 2007 Concordia Christmas Concert</a> The college is also known for its Music Department and associated touring ensembles.  <a>The Concordia Choir</a>, a critically-acclaimed a cappella choir (founded 1920), tours annually throughout the United States as well as abroad every few years, and is under the direction of world renowned conductor and composer, <a>Ren&#x00e9; Clausen</a>. <a>Paul J. Christiansen</a> was conductor of The Concordia Choir for 49 years (until 1986). The Concordia Band, under conductor Dr. Scott A. Jones, has recently released a professionally produced album titled: <em>Introductions</em>.  The college also maintains four other choirs, two concert bands, two full orchestras, two handbell choirs, two jazz ensembles, percussion ensemble and marimba choir as well as numerous chamber ensembles.  </p>
<p>The college also presents a Christmas Concert series performed before capacity audiences in Moorhead and at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis each December, with over 20,000 in total attendance over the multiple performances. The concert features the choirs, orchestra and handbell ensemble of Concordia staged before a mural reflecting the theme of each yearly concert.  Over 400 students perform in the concert.  The first Concordia Christmas Concert was held in 1927.  The liturgical artist <a>David J. Hetland</a> designed the murals until he died in 2006. A final digital display of his works was used in the 2006 concert, <em>On Our Way Rejoicing.</em></p>
<h2>The Cobber Ring</h2>
<p>The Cobber Ring is a longstanding symbol of Cobber pride.  Once a student has obtained Junior status they are allowed to purchase a Cobber Ring which is Gold and on the face it has a gold Cobber &quot;C&quot; with the class year inset in it on a ruby.  The ring is now thought of to be a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for those who obtain one.  As stated by Dr. Carroll L. Engelhardt, Professor of History, Concordia College, &quot;It eventually became an important symbol and a ready means of recognition for family members worldwide.&quot;  Early on the ring was designed by the class that was receiving them, but this changed in 1919 when students decided that Concordia should have a standard ring design.  In February 1920, Oscar Martinson a 1909 Concordia graduate and a jeweler in Moorhead designed the ring with its gold and ruby design, which is still the standard of today.  The oldest ring dates back to 1918, and a 1920 one that has the new and still used design.  The rings today are bought from the company Jostens and Jostens says that more than fifty percent of each class's students buy the ring.</p>
