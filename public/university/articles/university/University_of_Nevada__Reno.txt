<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Manzanita Lake in the southwestern part of the campus.</a> The University of Nevada was established by the Nevada State Constitution, and was founded in <a>Elko, Nevada</a> in 1874. In 1885, the University of Nevada was moved from Elko to its current home in Reno.</p>
<p>After nearly a century of quiet prominence in Nevada and around the western U.S., the University of Nevada has made large strides toward becoming the modern institution it is today with the opening of the <a>Desert Research Institute</a> in 1960 and a medical school in 1967. The University of Nevada remained the only four-year academic institution in the state of Nevada until 1965, when the Nevada Southern campus (now the <a>University of Nevada, Las Vegas</a>) was separated to become its own university.</p>
<p>Today the University of Nevada, Reno is one of the best funded universities in the country. According to The Education Trust, UNR's per pupil spending ranked 62nd out of 553 public universities, spending $30,290 per pupil in 2006. Despite the high level of spending, UNR only graduates 46.7 percent of its students within 6 years, ranking 259th out of 553 public universities.</p>
<p>The University of Nevada, Reno has been affected by the national economic crisis, which resulted in the vertical cutting of several programs rather than blanket across the board cuts. The Fall 2010 semester saw the largest incoming class in the history of the University.</p>
<h3>Nevada or UNR?</h3>
<p>There is now controversy over whether the university should be called UNR or Nevada. However, some claim that since it was the first university in the state, its historical name should be its official designation, as it is in many other multi-campus public university systems such as the <a>University of Michigan</a>; or similar to the way the University of California's flagship campus of UC Berkeley is referred to as &quot;Cal&quot;. Several of the university's institutions retain the institution's traditional name: &quot;University of Nevada,&quot; including the alumni association, the student government, and the athletics department (which refers to the university's teams simply as &quot;Nevada,&quot; a practice held since the late 1800s). When the University plays in sports against in-state rival, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the school's name is decided by the home team. When the game is held in Reno, it reads UNLV vs Nevada, however, if held in Las Vegas it reads, UNLV vs UNR.</p>

<h2>Student media</h2>
<p>Starting in the Fall 2010 semester, Nevada broadcast journalism students started &quot;Wolf Pack Week,&quot; a 30-minute television newscast that is shown around campus.  Future episodes will air on PBS in Reno and Las Vegas.  </p>
<p>Nevada's editorially independent, weekly student newspaper is called <em><a>The Nevada Sagebrush</a></em>. It comes out every Tuesday afternoon, and employs more than 40 people, 25 full-time. Prior to 2004, the newspaper called itself simply the <em>Sagebrush</em>.</p>
<p>The newspaper took home Pacemakers in 2008 and 2009 at the Associated Collegiate Press conferences in Kansas City and Austin, Tex. It was also a finalist for a Pacemaker at the 2006 and 2007 ACP student journalism awards. It has won the best of show award at the fall 2005, 2006 and 2007 ACP national conferences in its category (weekly broadsheet at a four-year university). It was also nominated for an online ACP Pacemaker in 2008. It's new web site, [www.nevadasagebrush.com], which launched in the fall of 2007, has also been recognized by the Center for Innovation in College Media for it breaking news packages, podcasts, videos and general innovation and Web presence. Many of The <em>Nevada Sagebrush<strong>s former editors go on to work and take internships at newspapers and news organizations such as </strong></em>The Washington Post<em>, </em>The Oregonian<em>, </em>USA Today<em>, </em>The Miami Herald<em>, </em>The Arizona Republic<em> and the Associated Press as well as dozens of local newspapers around the country.</em></p>
<p><a>Insight Magazine</a> is the only student-run magazine at the University of Nevada, Reno. Formerly Nevada's yearbook for nearly 100 years, <em>Insight Magazine</em>, has evolved into the second major publication circulating at the university. The first edition of Insight Magazine was published in September 2008. It presents itself as a theme-based monthly magazine, providing photography, stories and graphics,  in contrast to the weekly, newspaper-style of <em>The Sagebrush</em>. It is put out both in print and online. The online version, <em>UNRINSIGHT.com</em>, provides both support for the published stories and independent content.</p>
<p>In its sophomore year, Insight Magazine has received national attention from major college media organizations, such as the Associated College Press and the College Media Advisers. Insight placed fifth for headline presentation in Best of Collegiate Design 2009 by the &quot;College Media Advisers&quot;.
