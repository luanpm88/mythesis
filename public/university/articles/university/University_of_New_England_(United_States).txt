<p>The <strong>University of New England</strong> (<strong>UNE</strong>) is an independent, coeducational university with two campuses in <a>Maine</a>: the main campus in <a>Biddeford</a> and another in <a>Portland</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1939, a boys-only high school and <a>junior college</a> called the College S&#x00e9;raphique was founded in Biddeford by Father Decarry and the Franciscan friar of St. Andre's parish. In 1952, the school changed its name to St. Francis College and began granting <a>bachelor's degree</a>s with state approval in 1953.  The school became <a>co-educational</a> for the first time in 1967 and the monks finally withdrew from the administration of the college in 1974. The campus of the former Westbrook College is now known as the UNE Portland Campus.</p>
