<h2>History</h2>
<p>Queen's University Belfast has its roots in the Belfast Academical Institution, which was founded in 1810 and remains as the <a>Royal Belfast Academical Institution</a>. <a>thumb|right||War Memorial and main entrance</a></p>
<p>The <em>Irish Universities Act, 1908</em> dissolved the <a>Royal University of Ireland</a>, which had replaced the Queen's University of Ireland in 1879, and created two separate universities: the current <a>National University of Ireland</a> and Queen's University of Belfast.</p>
<h3>Parliamentary representation</h3>
<p>  The university was one of only eight United Kingdom universities to hold a parliamentary seat in the <a>Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> at Westminster until such representation was abolished in 1950. The university was also <a>represented</a> in the <a>Parliament of Northern Ireland</a> from 1920&ndash;1968, where its graduates elected four seats.</p>
<h2>Academic life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Ashby building QUB.jpg|thumb|right||Ashby building, [[Stranmillis]]]] In addition to the main campus not far from the centre of Belfast, the university has two associated <a>university college</a>s, these being <a>St Mary's</a> and <a>Stranmillis</a> both also located in Belfast.  Although offering a range of degree courses, these colleges primarily provide training for those wishing to enter the <a>teaching</a> profession. The university has formal agreements with other colleges in Northern Ireland and operates several outreach schemes to rural areas.</p>
<p>While the university refers to its main site as a campus, the university's buildings are in fact spread over a number of public streets in South Belfast, centring around University Road, University Square and <a>Stranmillis Road</a>, with other departments located further afield.</p>
<p>On June 20, 2006 the university announced a &#x00a3;259 million investment programme focusing on facilities, recruitment and research. One of the outcomes of this investment has been a new university library, opened in July 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2010, the university announced that they would be launching a &#x00a3;7.5m Ansin international research hub with Seagate Technologies.</p>
<h3>Schools</h3>
<p>Academics at Queen's are organized into twenty schools across three faculties. Each school operates as a primary management unit of the university and the schools are the focus for education and research for their respective subject areas. </p>
<h3>Institutes</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: <a>thumb|right|250px|The Quad at Queen's</a> --&gt; Several institutes are also associated with Queen's. Located close to the main campus is the <em>Institute of Professional Legal Studies at Queen's</em> which offers training to law graduates to enable them to practise as <a>solicitors</a> or <a>barristers</a> in Northern Ireland, England &amp; Wales and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>The <em>Institute of Theology</em> consists of several colleges with a <a>Christian</a> emphasis, including <a>St Mary's</a> (<a>Catholic</a>), <a>Union Theological College</a> (Presbyterian) as well as <a>Baptist</a> and <a>Methodist</a> colleges in Belfast. In all five colleges teach any programmes with a theological emphasis on behalf of the university; the university may confer theology degrees but cannot teach the subject itself.</p>

<h3>Admissions and students</h3>
<p>Entrants to Queen's have, on average, 359 <a>A/AS-level</a> <a>points</a> and there are currently 5.3 applications per place. The <em>Sunday Times</em> has described the Queen's admissions policy as &quot;among the most socially inclusive in Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. although this is mainly due to the lack of <a>private school</a>s in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The total student population is 24,560, of whom 19,165 are undergraduates and 5,395 postgraduates. Of the undergraduate population, 18,145 are from the UK, 640 from elsewhere in the <a>European Union</a> and 380 are from outside the EU. The figures for postgraduates are 4,115 from the UK, 650 from elsewhere in the EU, and 630 from the rest of the world, mainly from China, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Queen's was established as a non-sectarian institution, with the aim of attracting both Protestant and Catholic students. While the university does not publish data on the religion affiliation of its students, <a>Rupert Taylor</a>, who conducted his <a>PhD</a> research on the university during <a>The Troubles</a>, argued in an article published in 1988 that &quot;Whilst in the past, especially before the <a>Second World War</a>, Catholics were under-represented this is not currently the case&quot;. Taylor cites data showing that Catholic representation amongst undergraduates rose from 21.9 per cent in 1958/59 to 27.4 per cent in 1968/69 and 42.5 per cent in 1978/79. By the late 1990s, 54 per cent of Queen's students were Catholics, compared to a 48 per cent share of the Northern Ireland population aged 18&#x2013;25. The growing share of Catholics in the student population is in part due to the tendency of middle-class Protestants to go to university in <a>Great Britain</a> rather than Northern Ireland. The QUB boathouse, home of <a>Queen's University Belfast Boat Club</a> (QUBBC) and Queen's University of Belfast Ladies Boat Club (QUBLBC), is located on the <a>River Lagan</a> near <a>Stranmillis</a>. The Dragonslayers Gaming Society hosts one of Ireland's largest games conventions, <a>Q-Con</a>, in June of each year, and cultural groups such as <a>An Cumann Gaelach</a> and the <a>Ulster-Scots</a> Society are also present. The Queen's University Mountaineering Club is notable for producing three <a>Everest</a> summiteers including Ireland's first, <a>Dawson Stelfox</a>. Dr <a>Roger McMorrow</a> and Dr Nigel Hart also summited in May 2007, and were subsequently jointly announced Queen's University Graduates of the year for 2006/07 for their role in rescuing a young Nepalese climber left for dead near the summit.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Queen's provides housing for both undergraduates and postgraduates, although because of the compact size of Northern Ireland many students chose to live at home and commute to the university. In 2005/06, 36 per cent of Queen's students lived in private accommodation within Belfast, 29 per cent lived with parents or guardians, 20 per cent in private accommodation outside of Belfast, and 10 per cent lived in university maintained accommodation.</p>
<p>The university provides accommodation on a purpose-built 'student village' called Elms Village, which has its own bar and shop, located on the <a>Malone Road</a>, south of the main campus, as well as in a number of houses in the <a>South Belfast</a> area, including at <a>College Gardens</a> and on Mount Charles.</p>
<h3>Cultural life</h3>
<p>The university hosts the annual <a>Belfast Festival at Queen's</a> and the <a>Belfast Film Festival</a>, and in 2007 held the Irish Student Drama Association Festival. It runs Northern Ireland's only arthouse cinema, <a>Queen's Film Theatre</a>, and an art gallery, the <a>Naughton Gallery at Queen's</a>, which is a registered museum. In 2008 the Naughton Gallery was awarded the prestigious Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts. Housed in the Lanyon building since 2001 is a marble statue by <a>Pio Fedi</a> of the great physicist <a>Galileo</a>, portrayed deep in thought.</p>
