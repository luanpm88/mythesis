<p></p>
<p><strong>Utah State University</strong> (<strong>USU</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>land-grant</a> and <a>research</a> university with its main campus in <a>Logan, Utah</a>. USU was founded in 1888 as the <strong>Agricultural College of Utah</strong> under the <a>Morrill Act</a>. The college's name was subsequently changed to <strong>Utah State Agricultural College</strong> and became the <strong>Utah State University of Agriculture and Applied Science</strong> in 1957. USU enrolls 25,065 students as of Fall 2009. USU is accredited by the <a>Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities</a> and is a major research university with longstanding ties to the <a>Department of Defense</a> and <a>NASA</a>, for which it conducts extensive <a>aerospace</a> research. It offers 176 bachelor's degrees, 97 master's degrees, and 38 doctoral degrees.</p>
<h2>USU System</h2>
<p> As part of its land-grant mission, USU strives to allow access to education for as many people as possible. Part of this includes accepting nearly all applicants to attend one of its campuses, if not the main campus in Logan. Beyond Logan, USU provides academic resources and support throughout the state. Regional campuses exist in <a>Brigham City</a>, <a>Tooele</a>, and the <a>Uintah Basin</a>, as well as the <a>Price</a> and <a>San Juan</a> campuses that constituted the former <a>College of Eastern Utah</a> (now known as <a>USU-College of Eastern Utah</a>). At each of these locations, students may receive any of a wide selection of degrees without ever stepping foot on the Logan campus. USU also operates education centers in <a>Moab</a>, <a>Ogden</a>, <a>Orem</a>, <a>Salt Lake City</a>, and elsewhere, and <a>extension</a> offices in 28 of Utah's 29 counties.</pre>
<p>Since affiliating with Utah State University on July 1, 2010, the campuses of the former CEU have retained some semblance of their own brand, including their own athletics, which will continue to compete in Price as the Eastern Utah Golden Eagles of the <a>NJCAA</a>. Determining the precise terms of the USU/CEU merger is an ongoing process.</pre>
<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Background and founding</h4>
<p>On December 16, 1861, <a>Justin Morrill</a> (VT) introduced a bill into the U.S. House of Representatives, &quot;to establish at least one college in each state upon a sure and perpetual foundation, accessible to all, but especially to the sons of toil...&quot; President <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> signed the <a>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a> into effect in July of the following year.</p>
<p>[[Image:Old Main Utah St Univ.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Old Main (Utah State University)|Old Main]], the agricultural college's now-iconic first building, now houses administrative offices and much of the College of HSS]]Meanwhile, after visiting a few rural agricultural schools in his native Denmark, <a>Anthon H. Lund</a> of the Utah Territorial Legislature decided that there existed in Utah a need for such a school fusing the highest in scientific and academic research with agriculture, the way of life for the vast majority of locals. Upon returning to the states, Lund heard about the Morrill Act, and pitched a vision for the college that would receive widespread support among the Territorial Legislature, who was at the time seeking to reapply for statehood. Now there came the question of location. According to historian Joel Ricks in 1938, &quot;<a>Provo</a> had received the Insane Asylum, <a>Salt Lake City</a> had the University and Capitol, and the majority of the legislature felt that the new institutions should be given to <a>Weber</a> and <a>Cache</a> Counties.&quot; Citizens in Logan, Cache County, banded together and successfully lobbied representatives for the honor. The bill to establish the Agricultural College of Utah was passed on March 8, 1888, and on September 2, 1890, 14-year-old Miss Vendla Berntson enrolled as its first student.</p>
<h4>Consolidation controversies</h4>
<p>In its early years, the college narrowly dodged two major campaigns to consolidate its operations with the <a>University of Utah</a>. Much controversy arose in response to President <a>William J. Kerr</a>'s expansion of the college's scope beyond its agricultural roots. Detractors in <a>Salt Lake City</a> feared that such an expansion would come at the expense of the University of Utah, and pushed consolidation as a counter.</p>
<p>In 1907, an agreement was struck to instead limit the curricula of the Agricultural College strictly to agriculture, domestic science, and mechanic arts. This meant closing all departments in Logan, including the already-impressive music department, which did not fall under that umbrella. Consequently, the University of Utah became solely responsible, for a time, for courses in engineering, law, medicine, fine arts, and pedagogy, despite the Agricultural College's initial charter in 1888 which mandated that it offer instruction in such things. The bulk of the curricular restrictions were lifted over the next two decades, with the exception of law and medicine, which have since remained the sole property of the University of Utah.</p>
<h4>Widespread growth</h4>
<p>Amid the tumult, the Agricultural College grew modestly, adding its statewide Extension program in 1914. A year later, the first master's degrees were awarded. UAC, as it was commonly abbreviated, also received a notable boost as a direct result of World War I. Colleges and universities nationwide were temporarily transformed into training grounds for the short-lived Student Army Training Corps, composed of students who received military instruction and could then return to their educations following their military service. As the then-tiny campus could not otherwise support such large numbers of new students, college president Elmer Peterson convinced the state in 1918 to appropriate funds for permanent brick buildings, which could be used as barracks for SATC students during the war, and instruction afterward. Though the war was soon to end, the campus essentially doubled in size.</pre>
<p>The 1920s and 1930s saw the genesis of major growth, especially with the acceptance of the college into the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1926. Doctoral degrees were first granted in 1950, and the college became known as Utah State University in 1957. The brand new [[Merrill-Cazier Library]] opened in 2005, and other facilities have followed.</pre>
<h2>Logan Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:UsuOldMainDistance.jpg|thumb|View of [[Old Main (Utah State University)|Old Main]] from outside the Taggart Student Center]]USU's main campus in <a>Logan</a> is considered one of the university's greatest assets. It is situated on about , approximately one mile northeast of downtown Logan, at the mouth of <a>Logan Canyon</a>. The campus lies on a &quot;bench,&quot; or shelf-like foothill overlooking the valley to the west. <a>Mount Logan</a> and the <a>Bear River Range</a> rise sharply to the immediate east. The campus contains over a hundred major buildings. Most student activity is centered around the south end of campus, which is home to the vast majority of academic departments, the quad, the Taggart Student Center, and the <a>Old Main</a> building.</p>
<p>Notable structures include <a>Old Main</a>, the college's first building, as well as the <a>Merrill-Cazier Library</a>, the . ultra-modern main university library, which houses over 1,549,000 total volumes. The library also boasts an extensive special collections and archives area, an automated storage and retrieval system, and over 150 workstations and 33 group study rooms. Also notable is the [[Performance Hall (Utah State University)|Manon Caine Russell-Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall]], an architectural marvel which is said to contain some of the best acoustics in the entire Western United States. Many more students live in the multitude of off-campus housing options nearby. Students on campus may choose to dine in one of two cafeterias, as well as the Quadside Cafe at [[Merrill-Cazier Library]], the full-service Skyroom restaurant, and the Hub, which includes fast-food restaurants such as [[Hogi Yogi]] and [[Taco Time]]. On the east edge of campus sits Aggie Ice Cream, a local tourist hotspot dating back to 1888, which produces &quot;world-famous&quot; ice cream and cheese products, as well as sandwiches and soups.</pre>
<p>Along with Aggie Ice Cream, well-known traditions include the rite of passage of becoming a True Aggie, which requires a student to kiss someone who is already a True Aggie on top of the Block &quot;A.&quot; Two students may also become True Aggies together on Homecoming night or on A-Day. At one point recently, USU held the title in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most couples kissing at the same place at the same time.</pre>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>In 1970, Utah State student Sue Brown and Director of Student Activities Val R. Christensen created one of the first service organization in the nation. VOICE, Volunteer Organization for Involvement in the Community and Environment, worked to improve the environment and social issues in Cache Valley. VOICE became The Val R. Christensen Service Center in 1999 in honor of Dr. Christensen&#x2019;s efforts and support of the organization. Today, students are involved in more than 20 service organizations including Aggie Special Olympics, Aggies for Africa, Alternative Breaks, and Senior University.</pre>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Sustainability efforts on campus are widespread, and include the Aggie Shuttle system, which operates four routes around campus and the neighborhoods nearby. The campus is served by the Cache Valley Transit District which runs throughout <a>Cache Valley</a> and as far away as <a>Preston, Idaho</a>. In addition, Aggie Blue Bikes is a popular student-run program that checks bicycles out to students free of charge for a semester at a time. Since the program began in 2005, commuter traffic on campus has decreased by half.</pre>
<p>In the mid-2000s, USU installed natural gas heating plants that have reduced air emissions from 265 tons to less than 20 tons in five years. The university has also retrofitted  of space with low-energy light bulbs, which has reduced university costs by a full 30 percent. The Caine College of the Arts houses the departments of Art, Music, Theatre Arts, and Interior Design, along with the [[Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art]].</pre>
<p>Performance facilities include the <a>Chase Fine Arts Center</a>, which houses the Kent Concert Hall among other venues, and the free-standing <a>Manon Caine Russell-Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall</a>, completed in 2006.  The 400-seat [[Performance Hall (Utah State University)|Performance Hall]], designed by the architectural firm [[Sasaki Associates]], has been praised as one of the best acoustic performance spaces in the [[American West]], and received an Honor Award from the Utah Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].  The [[Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art]], designed by architect [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] and opened in 1982, contains one of the largest art collections in the [[Intermountain Region]].  Its holdings include nationally significant collections of ceramics, Native American art, and especially artworks produced in the [[American West]] since 1945.</pre>
<p>USU's music program is particularly renowned in the region. Prominent faculty include Dean <a>Craig Jessop</a>, longtime director of the <a>Mormon Tabernacle Choir</a>, as well as opera singer <a>Michael Ballam</a>, <a>Juilliard</a>-trained pianist Gary Amano, and the <a>Fry Street Quartet</a>, USU's string quartet-in-residence.</pre>
<h3>College of Agriculture</h3>
<p>The College of Agriculture is known for Nutrition and Food Science research, as well as significant breakthroughs and global outreach in plants and soil science, animal science, veterinary science and economics. College researchers were instrumental in the creation of the first cloned equines (horses), in a project collaboration with researchers at the <a>University of Idaho</a>. The college is also a leader in the international project to classify and research the sheep genome. The departments of the College of Agriculture include Plants, Soils and Climate; Applied Economics; Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Science; Nutrition and Food Science; Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning; and Agricultural Systems and Technology.</pre>
<h3>College of Engineering</h3>
<p>Much of USU's most widespread academic renown stems directly from the College of Engineering. USU houses the <a>Space Dynamics Laboratory</a> (SDL), which is a research facility focusing on military and science applications. The SDL frequently submits projects to the <a>Department of Defense</a> and <a>NASA</a>.  According to recent <a>National Science Foundation</a> statistics, USU ranked first among all universities in the U.S. in funding for aerospace research.  USU has also won multiple national aerospace engineering competitions in the past, including two in the 2008&#x2013;09 academic year alone.</pre>
<p>The <a>Utah Water Research Laboratory</a> is the oldest and largest facility of its kind in the nation. USU is considered the world's #1 university in a number of water-related engineering and scientific disciplines due in large part to the UWRL. The lab heads and contributes to numerous international projects, particularly in arid Middle Eastern nations.</pre>
<h3>College of Humanities and Social Sciences</h3>
<p>The College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the largest college at Utah State University, is also its most diverse and touches nearly every student on campus through its teaching of required general education classes. The College houses nine departments and various other programs.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The Merrill-Cazier Library, with the George S. Eccles Business Building looming in the background</a>In the <a>Humanities</a>, USU has long history in the study of the <a>American West</a>.  The university, through its departments of English and History, respectively, is the host institution for the scholarly journals <em>Western American Literature</em> and the <em><a>Western Historical Quarterly</a></em>, the official publications of the Western Literature Association and the <a>Western History Association</a>, respectively.  The Mountain West Center for Regional Studies, a Humanities outreach center at USU, sponsors public events and research focusing on the cultures and history of the Interior West and larger [[American West]].  University Special Collections and Archives, located at the [[Merrill-Cazier Library]], has extensive archival holdings documenting the histories of [[Utah]], the [[Intermountain West]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], as well as one of the nation's largest collections pertaining to American [[folklore]], and the lives and works of western authors such as [[Jack London]] and poet [[May Swenson]], a Logan native and USU alumna.</pre>
<p>The college also houses the <a>USU Museum of Anthropology</a>, currently located in <a>Old Main</a>.</p>
<h3>College of Natural Resources</h3>
<p>USU has a long and illustrious history in the science and management of forests, rangeland, wildlife, and fisheries and watersheds.  Many graduates of the College of Natural Resources have gone on to high-ranking careers in the <a>National Forest Service</a>, <a>National Park Service</a>, and the <a>Bureau of Land Management</a>, and its graduate programs attract overachieving students from many nations.  The college also operates the Quinney Library, which houses collections relevant for natural resources education, management, and research.</p>
<p>The College of Natural Resources includes the departments of Watershed Sciences, Environment and Society, and Wildland Resources.</p>
<h3>College of Science</h3>
<p>Among the most notable aspects of USU's College of Science includes the rate at which its students are accepted into medical and dental schools. Despite the absence of such professional schools on site in Logan, students are admitted to medical and dental programs at a rate of nearly 30 percent above the national average each year. This is due in large part to the rigorous Prehealth Advising Program and resources like the Cadaver Lab, to which undergraduates have access.</pre>
<p>In the past decade, the Physics Department alone has produced a <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>, a <a>Marshall Scholar</a>, a <a>Fulbright Student Scholar</a>, nine <a>Goldwater Scholars</a>, and two Carnegie Professors of the Year.</pre>
<p>The College of Science houses the Departments of Biology, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, and Geology. The Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics includes one of only three actuarial science programs in the West.</p>
<h3>Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Logan as seen from campus</a>USU's Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services has been ranked by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> in the top 2% of prestigious graduate schools of education in the U.S. for the past decade. The college houses one of America's few combined programs in graduate psychology training, which integrates doctoral-level training across clinical, counseling, and school psychology, and is accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]].  Faculty are active in many of areas of psychological research, including [[neuropsychology]], [[child development]], [[health psychology]], and [[behavior therapy]].</pre>
<p>Department of Psychology professor Karl R. White is director of the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management, which focuses on the early identification and intervention of hearing loss in infants and young children.</p>
<h3>Jon M. Huntsman School of Business</h3>
<p> In 2007, Utah State's College of Business became the <a>Jon M. Huntsman School of Business</a> after a $26 million donation by the <a>philanthropist</a>. The School hopes to model itself after Huntsman's alma mater, the prestigious <a>Wharton</a> School of Business located at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<p>The Huntsman School of Business offers a number of graduate and undergraduate degrees in fields including management, <a>accounting</a>, <a>economics</a> and <a>finance</a>, and <a>management information systems</a> (MIS). The bachelor's degrees in entrepreneurship and international business are unique to USU within the state. The Huntsman School widely touts its travel programs, including the unique Huntsman Scholar Program, and the impressive transformation it's currently undergoing as it puts its new resources to use. This effort includes the hiring of high-profile faculty, such as [[Stephen R. Covey]], influential management scholar and author of the wildly popular best-seller ''[[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]]''. Covey begins teaching classes in 2010.</pre>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>As of Fall 2010, Utah State University enrolled 22,100 undergraduate students and 3,667 graduate students. 9,295 of these students were enrolled exclusively at regional campuses or in distance education. USU is home to more Carnegie Professors of the Year than any other school in Utah, and boasts nine of the last 15 for the state. The Carnegie is a teaching award, and in fact, USU strongly stresses close undergraduate involvement for even their most prestigious faculty. According to a recent survey, 49.7% of all faculty teach undergraduates, and 63.5% say they've worked with an undergraduate on a research project in the last two years. It is also the #1 public university in the West (and in the top 5 public universities nationwide) on the similar ''Forbes'' list of &quot;America's Best College Buys.&quot; USU has also in the past been ranked 1st in the nation among public universities, by ''U.S. News and World Report'', for graduates with the least amount of debt.</pre>
<p><em>The Princeton Review</em> has ranked Utah State among the &quot;Best Western&quot; schools for many years, and ''Popular Science'' called it one of the Top 10 Smartest Schools in the nation. The university also leads the nation in funding for aerospace research and the number of student experiments actually sent out into space.</pre>
<p>Logan and the surrounding communities also feature prominently on national lists, including #1 safest U.S. metropolitan area, #3 in &quot;Best Cities to Find a Job&quot;, and #10 in &quot;Best Small Places for Business and Careers&quot;.</pre>
<h3>Research and environmentalism</h3>
<p><a>right|150px|thumb|Merrill-Cazier Library's &quot;Borrower's Automated Retrieval Network&quot; (BARN) as viewed from the basement</a>Utah State University is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a research university with &quot;high research activity.&quot; It received a record $187 million in research awards during the 2010 fiscal year, a 29 percent increase over the previous year. In addition to its faculty and graduate work, the university strongly emphasizes the importance of undergraduate research. USU's Undergraduate Research program recently celebrated its 35th anniversary, making it one of the oldest such organizations in the nation.</p>
<p>Along with the <a>University of Utah</a>, USU is an anchor in the <a>Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR)</a> program, which is aimed at optimizing the university and region's most marketable strengths with the goal of bolstering Utah's high-tech economy. Nine <a>USTAR</a> teams currently perform research at Utah State.</p>
<p>Notable research centers based at USU include the <a>Space Dynamics Laboratory</a>, Energy Dynamics Laboratory, <a>Utah Water Research Laboratory</a>, Center for High Performance Computing, Utah Climate Center, Center for Advanced Nutrition, Center for the School of the Future, National Aquatic Monitoring Center, Intermountain Center for River Rehabilitation and Restoration, Mountain West Center for Regional Studies, and <a>Utah Botanical Center</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Listed here are some research and environmental highlights from recent years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thanks to the Get Away Special (GAS) team sponsored by the Department of Physics, Utah State has placed more student experiments into space than any educational institution in the world.</li>
  <li>A team of USU and <a>University of Idaho</a> researchers were the first in the world to successfully clone an <a>equine</a>.  The baby mule, named <a>Idaho Gem</a>, was born May 4, 2003.</li>
  <li>In 2005, chemist Alexander Boldyrev and colleague Lai-Sheng Wang discovered inorganic aromaticity, a property in chemistry that was initially thought to occur only in organic material. Recently, Boldyrev and Wang made another breakthrough and discovered <a>antiaromaticity</a>, which was a featured article in the April 24 issue of <em>Science</em> magazine.</li>
  <li>In reaction to recent massive oil spills and the EPA's creation of the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC), USU has created its own SPCC with a detailed map of locations, oil types, quantities and containment specifications. The plan maps all possible outfalls from oil storage locations that may impact the waters of the United States.</li>
  <li>Research efforts are underway to produce a cost-competitive bio-diesel from algae. Lance Seefeldt and other professors formed the Biofuels Program at Energy Dynamics Laboratory to develop new and emerging technologies that will produce methane, biodiesel, hydrogen and alcohols from renewable, carbon-dioxide-neutral energy sources, such as consumer and agricultural waste and sunlight.</li>
</ul>
<p>[[Image:Utah State University observatory and business building at night.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Observatory built in 2009 on top of the SER building as seen at night.|Observatory built in 2009 on top of the SER building. For dept. of Physics and public use, it houses a 20-inch [[reflecting telescope]].]]</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dallas Hanks, a doctoral student, has initiated a program at the university called FreeWays to Fuel, which is growing <a>oilseed</a> crops for <a>biodiesel</a> in previously unused municipal land such as highway roadsides. Hanks estimates that in the U.S.,  of such unused land exists&#x2014;land which generally serves no other purpose and currently costs tax dollars to maintain. Early yields from the crops are promising, and the program has spread to other land-grant universities across the nation. He has a goal to produce 50 million gallons of biofuel in five years.</li>
  <li>On January 15, 2010, the university received ownership of the $30 million-plus Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter outside of <a>Park City</a>. The center consists of a  land trust and a , state-of-the-art facility dedicated to environmental education. The preserve protects critical wetland and foothill terrain in the heart of one of the state&#x2019;s fastest-growing areas, and the EcoCenter, completed in 2009, is a multi-use facility with space for educational and community activities. The facility is LEED Platinum Certified, the highest standard for design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings.</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Utah State University promotes the <a>OpenCourseWare</a> (OCW) Project (open and free university courses) and is developing an open <a>content management system</a> for OCW called eduCommons. This <a>open source</a> content management system is one of the important technology projects in the <a>MIT OpenCourseWare Initiative</a>. eduCommons aids in the creation of OCW sites and has already been adopted by several universities for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Romney Stadium during an Aggie football game</a>USU's sports teams are known as the <a>Aggies</a> and are a part of the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> <a>Western Athletic Conference</a> (WAC). The official mascot is <a>Big Blue</a>. The university sponsors <a>football</a>, <a>men's</a> and women's basketball, volleyball, softball, women's soccer, track and field, golf, tennis, cross country, and gymnastics. An array of club sports exist as well, and among them, the hockey and baseball teams are particularly popular with students.</p>
<p>The Aggies have been members of the WAC since 2005 and have won several conference championships in that time, including men's basketball in 2008 and 2009, indoor track in 2008, outdoor track in 2007 and 2009, and cross country each year since joining the conference (2005&#x2013;10). Women's cross country has also won WAC championships in 2006 and 2008, and women's soccer won in 2008. Utah State has won numerous conference championships in previous conferences. National championships include women's volleyball in 1978 and softball in 1980 and 1981. Immediately previous to the WAC, Utah State was a member of the <a>Big West Conference</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Aggie fans cheer on their team at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum</a>The crown jewel of Aggie athletics has long been the <a>men's basketball</a> team, which plays in the <a>Dee Glen Smith Spectrum</a>, which has been called one of the nation's top 5 loudest and toughest places for opposing teams to play. USU basketball is 157&#x2013;12 at home during the <a>Stew Morrill</a> era, has received 6 <a>NCAA Tournament</a> berths in the last ten years, and has amassed more wins than any team in the nation except Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga during that time.  During the 2008&#x2013;09 season, USU's ranking in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll rose as high as #17.</pre>
<p>Following the great heights of the 1960s through 1980s, Aggie football has fallen upon hard times in recent years, leading to a disproportionate lack of USU sports coverage in statewide and national media. Recent efforts by the athletic department have resulted in a renewed focus on recruiting, specifically in state, and with the addition of head coach <a>Gary Andersen</a>. </p>
<p>Such recovery efforts spearheaded by new Athletics Director <a>Scott Barnes</a> have included inking deals with TV stations, replacing the head football coach, raising funds, and accomplishing numerous necessary reorganizations, despite the Athletics Department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and WAC schools. In large part due to his efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses.</p>
<p>Two primary news outlets serve the USU student body: (1) <em>The Utah Statesman</em> is sponsored by the university and is published three times per week. <em>The Statesman</em> won best non-daily student paper for region nine in the SPJ awards last year. (2) <em>Hard News Cafe</em> is a news website operated by USU's Department of Journalism and Communications which has won numerous awards for its student reporting, partially because it is often the only entrant in the categories in which it wins.</p>
<p><a>Utah Public Radio</a>, based at the university, is heard on KUSU (91.5 FM) and KUSR (89.5 FM) in Logan, and throughout Utah on a system of 26 translators.  UPR broadcasts &quot;a mix of information, public affairs, and fine arts programming.&quot; KUSU is a <a>National Public Radio</a> member station, and an affiliate of <a>Public Radio International</a>. In addition, an entirely student-run radio station called Fusion HD3 broadcasts on the third HD channel of 89.5 in Cache Valley and online.</p>
<p>Aggie Television (ATV) is a cable service lineup of approximately 110 channels offered free of charge to all on-campus residents.  ATV produces Crossroads, a bulletin/announcement channel; and Aggie Advantage, providing local and student video programming.</p>
<h2>Notable people</h2>
<p></p>
<p>USU has more than 110,000 alumni throughout the United States and in more than 100 other nations.</p>
<p>Particularly notable alumni include <a>Harry Reid</a>, current <a>U.S. Senate</a> <a>Majority Leader</a>; <a>May Swenson</a>, poet; <a>Merlin Olsen</a>, pro football hall-of-famer, actor, and TV personality; <a>Rick Bass</a>, writer and environmental activist; <a>Charlie Denson</a>, President of Nike Brand; <a>Chris Cooley</a>, pro-football tight-end for the Washington Redskins; and <a>Mary L.
