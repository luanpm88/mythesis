<p><strong>SUNY Adirondack</strong> is a community college founded in 1961 to serve both <a>Warren</a> and <a>Washington</a> counties in New York State.  It changed its name from Adirondack Community College on March 1, 2010.  It enrolls students from many other counties and from other states and foreign countries.</p>
<h2>The campus</h2>
<h3>Office and service buildings</h3>
<p>Warren Hall houses the business office, the <a>financial aid</a> office, payroll, office of the <a>registrar</a>, Brian Durant the Dean of Student affairs, the <a>admissions</a> office, and the office of accessibility services which provides assistance to students with <a>disabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Student Center houses the school bookstore, a <a>cafeteria</a>, a student lounge with big-screen TV, an <a>air hockey</a> table, and a number of couches, chairs, and tables for students to relax or sleep.  It also houses the Student Activities office, which is home to the ACC Student Senate.</p>
<h3>Classroom buildings</h3>
<p>Eisenhart Hall is the oldest classroom building on campus. A major renovation was completed in April 2006, including a new <a>geothermal heating</a> system, as it previously was poorly climate controlled, and now also houses a <a>SUNY Plattsburgh</a> <a>lecture hall</a>.  This building teaches primarily <strong>business</strong> classes : <a>social science</a> classes: <a>psychology</a>, <a>sociology</a>, <a>history</a>, and <a>political science</a>, though other classes are taught here as well.</p>
<p>Washington Hall is next to Eisenhart Hall and is home to nursing labs, the radio station (<a>WGFR</a>), the television studio (for instructional use), a video editing lab, photography labs and darkroom, and a <a>Mac</a> lab for graphic design/media arts students.</p>
<p>Dearlove Hall houses the math lab, the center for reading and writing (CRW) and the learning specialist's office. The offices of most <a>English</a> and <a>Math</a> professors are located in the basement of this hall. <a>Art</a>, <a>language arts</a>, and mathematics courses are primarily taught in this building. There is also an <a>art gallery</a> and a small lecture hall.</p>
<p>Scoville Building houses a small caf&#x00e9;, the <a>library</a>, the computer center, a computer lab, and the computer classrooms. There are only a few non-computer classrooms here, which mainly provide room for overflow from Eisenhart Hall. The top floor houses the Office of the President (Dr. Ron Heacock). The library contains more than 63,000 books, including over 5,000 reference books, and subscribes to over 340 journals and other periodicals.</p>
<p>Science and Humanities building is an academic building that contains all <a>science</a> labs, a performance <a>auditorium</a>, and several music classrooms. <a>Music</a> lessons for 17 instruments and private voice are available for credit to all students, regardless of major.</p>
<p>As of October 15, 2007, work has begun on a new building, the Higher Education Center, which is being built to house multiple classes for the <a>SUNY Plattsburgh</a> extension.</p>
