<p>  The <strong>&#x00e9;cole sup&#x00e9;rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris</strong> or <strong>ESPCI ParisTech</strong> (<em>The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution</em>) is a <a>chemistry</a> and <a>physics</a> <a>engineering</a> <a>college</a> run by the city of <a>Paris</a>, <a>France</a> and a member of <a>ParisTech</a> (Paris Institute of Technology). It conducts high level research in those fields.</p>
<p>The students enter the School after an examination (concours <a>Ecole Polytechnique</a>-ESPCI) following at least two years of <a>Classes Pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a>. They are called <em>P&#x00e9;c&#x00e9;en</em> or <em>PC1</em>(boys) and <em>P&#x00e9;c&#x00e9;enne</em> or <em>PCN</em>(girls). The School itself is also known as Physique-Chimie or simply PC.</p>
<p>The ESPCI ParisTech is one of the founding members of <a>ParisTech</a> and a member of the <a>IDEA League</a> and the <a>UNITECH International Society</a>.</p>
<p>ESPCI develops its relations with industrial partners such as <a>Schlumberger</a>, <a>Rhodia</a>, <a>Total</a>, <a>Thales</a>, <a>Arkema</a>, <a>Michelin</a>, which sponsored each yeargroup of students and signed research contracts with ESPCI laboratories. ESPCI ParisTech has signed partnership agreements with <a>L'Or&#x00e9;al</a> and <a>Saint-Gobain</a> for the recruitment of their professionals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, following the annexion of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany, France lost the Ecole de Chimie de Mulhouse (Mulhouse Chemistry School), which was at that time the best Chemistry school in the country. One of its professors, Charles Lauth, starting in 1878, obtained from the public administration the creation of a <a>Grande Ecole</a>. </p>
<p>In 1882 the Ecole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris was established and became the ESPCI, the current name, in 1948. Since its foundation, the founders of the school have been insisting on the pluridisciplinarity of the courses available. Biology was introduced in 1994. Studying at the ESPCI is free of charge as voted by the Counsel of Paris.</p>
<p>After its establishement, the School rapidly became a meeting spot for the best scientists. From 1880 on, Pierre and Jacques Curie started a serie of research on crystal electrical properties that led to the <a>piezoelectricity</a> discovery. At the end of the year 1897, Marie Curie started her work on uranic beaming discovered by Becquerel one year earlier. After numerous experiments in the ESPCI laboratories, she found out that pechblende was 45 times more radioactive than uranium or thorium. In July 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of polonium and in December of the same year that of radium. <a>Pierre</a> and <a>Marie Curie</a> received the Physics <a>Nobel Prize</a> in 1903. After the death of her husband, Marie Curie was granted the Chemistry Nobel Prize in 1911.</p>
<p>Many former students have distinguished themselves, amongst which there are <a>Georges Claude</a>(5th year), founder of <a>Air Liquide</a>, <a>Paul Langevin</a> (7th year), physicist and inventor and <a>Fr&#x00e9;d&#x00e9;ric Joliot-Curie</a> (39th year), founder of the <a>CEA</a> and Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 with his wife Ir&#x00e8;ne.</p>
<p>In 1976, <a>Pierre-Gilles de Gennes</a> became Director of the School (Nobel Prize 1991).</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>The course of study lasts four years. The two first years are devoted to giving the students a strong basic education in Physics, Chemistry and in Biology. During the third year, the students perform an industrial internship and research projects in laboratories. The students can major in Physics, Chemistry or Physico-chemistry. During the fourth year, the students can either start doctoral studies or do a master abroad. They can also complete their education in various application schools (master for engineers). In 2002 a master program in Bioengineering was created.</p>
<p>The engineering practical training program is based on the industrial internship at the beginning of the third year, the projects in laboratories during the last two years, lectures on recruitment process and social economics at the beginning of the fourth year. The compulsory industrial internship, which lasts from 4 to 6 months, has a huge importance. More than 50% of the students do their internship abroad, in European countries, the United-States, Japan, China, Australia...</p>
<p>The quality of the education given at the ESPCI enables its students to work in any industrial sector (Telecommunication, Computing, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Biology...), mostly in Research and Development (47% in R&amp;D, 10% in Production, 10% in Consultancy, 5% in Environment, 3% in Teaching, 3% in Computing, 22% in other fields such as Marketing, Management...).</p>
<p>5 researchers from ESPCI have received the <a>Nobel Prize</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Pierre</a> and <a>Marie Curie</a></li>
  <li><a>Marie Curie</a> - second <a>Nobel Prize</a></li>
  <li><a>Fr&#x00e9;d&#x00e9;ric Joliot-Curie</a>,</li>
  <li><a>Pierre-Gilles de Gennes</a>,</li>
  <li><a>Georges Charpak</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<p>Candidates to the competitive examination must have their <a>baccalaur&#x00e9;at</a> or an equivalent diploma. They must be over 17 year-old and under 22 year-old the 1st January of the examination year. Foreign candidates must be under 26 year-old and can attempt this examination only three times.</p>
<p>The written, oral and sporting tests are the same as for the Ecole Polytechnique but the tests are weighted differently.</p>
<p>It is also possible for students from Universities to enter the School. They must have first class honour. They are selected according to their academic results.</p>
