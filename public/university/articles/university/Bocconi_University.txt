<p>Bocconi provides <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>graduate</a> and <a>post-graduate</a> education, in addition to a range of <a>double degree</a> experiences. Courses can be taken either in italian language or in english. Masters in business administration are also provides by SDA Bocconi which is the University's business school. Its MBA program has recently been ranked among the global top 40 by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em><img> Global MBA Rankings 2009.. Since 2008, Bocconi has also expanded its research division by inaugurating dedicated research centers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The athenaeum was founded in 1902 by Ferdinando Bocconi who intended to create in his hometown, Milan, an institution where accountants and future businessmen could improve their cultural and technical skills. The university was named after the founder's son who died in the <a>battle of Adwa</a>, during the <a>first Italo-Ethiopian War</a>. Since this tragic event Ferdinando Bocconi decided to sell his business and endow the revenues in the new school of commerce to keep his son's memory alive.</p>
<p>The university was a first affiliated to the engineering school <a>Politecnico di Milano</a> and the teaching model developed at first was inspired by the one adopted at the &#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure of <a>Antwerp</a>.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Bocconi has stood for <a>liberalism</a>, <a>pluralism</a>, and <a>social progress</a>.  In the words of its first Rector and President, <a>Leopoldo Sabbatini</a>, a <a>democratic</a> <a>lawyer</a>, Bocconi's aim is to <em>&quot;promote harmony between school and life.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Today, Bocconi is a university of international standing in <a>business</a>, <a>economics</a>, and <a>law</a>. It is also a <a>research university</a>, getting funds for its research projects from national and <a>supranational</a> institutions. By virtue of being a major node in the European and global network of business and economics universities, Bocconi exchanges faculty and cooperates on large projects with like-minded European and North-American universities and business schools. Bocconi has strong network of exchange programs with prestigious institutions.</p>
<p>Bocconi has close relations with major <a>corporation</a>s and international agencies, as well as their managers and officials, and constantly interacts with the business and economic environment to tackle new issues, implement new techniques, and start new research endeavours.</p>
<p>Bocconi University is now structured around five major schools: Undergraduate School, Graduate School, Law School, PhD School, and, with a larger degree of autonomy, SDA Bocconi School of Management, its graduate business school. Bocconi presently offers Bachelor Degrees, Masters of Science, MBAs and PhDs in <a>Finance</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Management</a>, <a>Statistics</a>, <a>Law</a> and other disciplines. It also has a number of post-experience programs, and administers many customized executive education courses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the university promotes and often organizes numerous activities for <a>high school</a> students in Italy, such as <a>mathematics competition</a>s , <a>Model United Nations</a> simulations and other major events aimed at orienting them during their <a>secondary education</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Originally, Bocconi was located in Via Statuto, near the <a>Pinacoteca di Brera</a>, where its first building was inaugurated in 1902. The current campus of Bocconi is located between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of different buildings, all at walking distance to <a>Porta Ticinese</a>, the <a>Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio</a> and the <a>Torre Velasca</a> <a>skyscraper</a>.</p>
<p>The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the famous <a>architect</a> <a>Giuseppe Pagano</a> and is an epitome of <a>modernism</a> in Italian architecture. It hosts many classrooms, an aula magna, a <a>restaurant</a> and most of the administrative <a>offices</a>. Its entrance features two <a>lion</a> statues which are the subject of several university <a>myth</a>s.</p>
<p>The <em>pensionato</em> building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by the architect Giovanni Muzio and  hosts some grand halls, some of the <a>canteen</a> and <a>dormitory</a> facilities (350 bedrooms distributed on 5 floors), and some <a>faculty</a> offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a <a>symmetric</a> &quot;<a>L</a>&quot; letter. <a>left|thumb|260px|The SDA Bocconi building.</a> The <a>SDA Bocconi</a> building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university's bookstore. The campus <a>football pitch</a> is placed between the <em>pensionato</em> and the <a>SDA Bocconi</a> building.</p>
<p>The modern <em>Velodromo</em> building was projected by <a>Ignazio Gardella</a> and launched in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an ellipsoid <a>velodrome</a>. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The <em>Velodromo</em> uses a <a>geothermal exchange heat pump</a> as its <a>air conditioning</a> system, which contributes a lot to <a>energy conservation</a>. A <a>marble</a> statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.</p>
<p>Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the <a>Library</a> building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus <a>chapel</a> <em>&quot;San Ferdinando&quot;</em>, and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the <em>&quot;Language Center&quot;</em> and other <a>extracurricular</a> activities.</p>
<p>Several other administrative and research offices of Bocconi's individual institutes are scattered across the area, especially around Parco Ravizza and Viale Isonzo.</p>
<p>In 2007, a new building was constructed near the <em>Velodromo</em>. It was designed by Grafton architects of Dublin, who won the competition held to choose the design of the building in 2002. The new building is now used to host all faculty staff offices and the research institutes of the university.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>In the atrium of the oldest building of the university, there are three sets of doors. The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate. This derives from the old adage &quot;Chi passa tra i Leoni non si laurea alla Bocconi.&quot;.</p>
