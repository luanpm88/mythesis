<p>The <strong>University of Bradford</strong> (est. 1966) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Bradford</a>, <a>West Yorkshire</a>, <a>England</a>. Formed from a <a>technical college</a> in 1966, there are three campuses: the main campus, located on Richmond Road, the School of Health, on Trinity Road, but due to move to the main campus in Summer 2011 <a>School of Health New Build</a>, and the School of Management, at Emm Lane. According to <em><a>The Times</a></em> Good University Guide 2008, the University of Bradford is the 48th best university in the country. It has roughly 12,000 students enrolled, of which almost a third are <a>mature students</a>. Almost 25% of students are international students, and come from over 100 countries. 92% of the university's domestic students come from the <a>state sector</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Bradford was the first university in the UK to establish a Department of <a>Peace Studies</a> in 1973, and it is currently ranked first in the world for the subject. Its School of Management is also ranked third best in the UK . The university is currently undergoing a &#x00a3;79 million redevelopment programme, to improve both its building and its accommodation, as well as its facilities for disabled students, who compose almost 6% of the total student population.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history and founding</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The university's Richmond Building and Atrium in February 2008</a> The university has its origins in the Bradford Schools of Weaving, Design and Building dating from 1860 which in 1882 became the <a>Bradford Technical College</a>. In <a>1957</a>, the <a>Bradford Institute of Technology</a>, was formed as a &quot;<a>College of Advanced Technology</a>&quot; to take on the running of higher education courses. Construction of the Richmond Building, the largest building on campus, began in <a>1963</a>. The Horton Building and Chesham building were subsequently added, on the opposite side of Richmond Road.</p>
<p>The <a>Charter of Incorporation</a> was granted in <a>1966</a>, to create the University of Bradford; the then <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Harold Wilson</a> became the university's first <a>chancellor</a>.</p>
<h3>1980s and 1990s</h3>
<p>Expansion of the main campus continued in the 1980s, with the addition of the Library and Computer Centre, Communal Building, Pemberton Building and Ashfield Building. An extension to the Library and Computer Centre was completed in the mid-1990s. In 1996 the university joined with the former <a>Bradford and Airedale College of Health</a>, which then became the School of Health Studies within the university. The Department of Physics was closed in the 1980s. The Department of Mathematics was closed to new undergraduates in 1997, with the remaining postgraduate activities and lecture support being integrated into the Department of Computing as the Mathematics Unit. The Department of Mathematics has since been reopened within the School of Computing, Informatics and Media.</p>
<p>In 1987 the University became one of the twelve founding members of the <a>Northern Consortium</a>.</p>
<h3>2000s and Ecoversity</h3>
<p>The <a>Bradford Race Riots</a> of 2001 lead to a sharp fall in applications to the university, but the situation has improved since and in 2005 undergraduate applications from home students was up by 35% on the previous year.</p>
<p>In 2005, a &#x00a3;79 million redevelopment of the campus was announced, and a project to create the world's first 'Ecoversity' was formed. The university would strive to reduce its environmental footprint by reducing waste and using sustainable materials, and would imbue sustainability into everything that the institution does, including teaching. As part of this, Bradford became a <a>Fairtrade University</a> in December 2006.</p>
<p>As of the beginning of 2008, several of the redevelopment projects have been completed. The Richmond Building has been partially re-clad with extra insulation and a new atrium, designed by local <a>Saltaire</a> based Architects <a>Rance Booth &amp; Smith</a>, opened in December 2006; the roof of which uses <a>ETFE</a>, the same material used in the <a>Eden Project</a>. The university's cancer therapeutics research centre was moved from a separate site on All Saint's Road onto the main campus, into a new building which also provides conference facilities; the buildings on the old site were demolished in February 2008.</p>
<p>Redevelopment of the sports facilities was completed Summer 2009, and a new student village called &quot;The Green&quot; is being constructed  which is due to open in September 2011. Of the existing halls owned by the university, those on the Laisteridge Lane site were sold to <em>Corporate Residential Management</em> in 2005, and Shearbridge Green Halls were demolished in December 2006. Longside Lane halls and Kirkstone Halls were demolished during the first half of <a>2009</a>.</p>
<p>In September <a>2009</a> it was announced that the University was to merge with <a>Leeds College of Music</a>. The college had originally announced a merger with <a>Leeds Metropolitan University</a> in April 2009, however, discussions broke down due to issues with the provision of further education courses at the college. It was later announced that this merger would not go ahead due to financial constraints, although both institutions are committed to building up a working relationship and the University validates LCM's courses .</p>
<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>The <a>motto</a> which appears on most current University of Bradford publications is <em>Making Knowledge Work</em>, which relates to the institution's focus on courses that lead to employment. The university announced in June 2007 it was to use this phrase as a <a>trademark</a>. However, the motto inscribed beneath the official <a>coat of arms</a> is <em>Give Invention Light</em>, which is taken from <a>Shakespeare's Sonnet</a> 38.  It has also used the slogans <em>Be Inspired</em> and <em>Confronting Inequality, Celebrating Diversity</em> in recent promotional material.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>In 2005 Bradford was ranked 7th, for graduate placement, by <em><a>The Times</a></em> Good University Guide; with the nursing and a number of ancillary medical courses placing 100% of their students, within 6 months of graduation.</p>
<p>94% of students are from the state sector, though overseas students may account for most of the remaining 6%, with comparatively few independent-schooled students enrolled. The student drop-out rate for the 2005/06 academic year was 7.9%, a reduction over previous years.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>The current <a>chancellor</a> is the former world-class cricketer and <a>Pakistan</a>i politician <a>Imran Khan</a>, who was installed on 7 December 2005.  He took over from <a>Baroness Lockwood</a>, who had served since 1997. Prior chancellors have included, in reverse order, <a>Trevor Holdsworth</a> (1992&#x2013;1997), <a>John Harvey-Jones</a> (1986&#x2013;1991) and <a>Harold Wilson</a> (later Lord Wilson of Rievaulx) (1966&#x2013;1985).</p>
<p>The current Vice-Chancellor (as of 1 June 2007) is <a>Professor Mark Cleary</a>.  He joined the university from the <a>University of Plymouth</a> where he was the Acting Vice-Chancellor (Academic). He was due to start in his new position  following Professor Chris Taylor's retirement on the 1st May. However due to the sudden death of Professor Roland Levinsky, the vice-chancellor of Plymouth, his appointment was delayed until the summer.</p>
<p>He succeeded <a>Professor Chris Taylor</a> who held the post from 1 October 2001 to 30 April 2007, when he retired from the university. Taylor took over from <a>Professor Colin Bell</a>, who was Vice-Chancellor between 1998 and 2001 and who was later Vice-Chancellor at the <a>University of Stirling</a>. Bell died suddenly in April 2003 and the University of Bradford now holds an annual memorial lecture in his name discussing <a>widening participation</a>.</p>
<h2>Schools</h2>
<p>The University of Bradford comprises seven Schools: </p>
<h3>Engineering, Design and Technology</h3>
<p>The university inherited several engineering courses from the Bradford Institute of Technology and some of these courses, such as <a>Civil Engineering</a> are still taught today. All of the engineering courses are accredited by their relevant institute.</p>
<p>The school also has a large number of both undergraduate and postgraduate design and technology courses. Its research areas include <a>automotive engineering</a>, <a>polymers</a>, <a>telecommunications</a> and advanced materials engineering.</p>
<p>From the establishment of the university in 1966, the individual branches of engineering were taught in separate departments. When reorganisation of the three faculties of the university took place, a single School of Engineering, Design and Technology was created and incorporated the Department of <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>, the Department of Civil &amp; Structural Engineering, the Department of <a>Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering</a> and the Department of Industrial Studies. The Department of <a>Chemical Engineering</a> was closed shortly before the creation of the new school.</p>
<p>Recently the school has had a number of initiatives to boost the number of women studying on its courses, the latest being called 'FAIRER' (Females Actively Involved in Rewarding Engineering Roles).</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Unity Building, housing the School of Health Studies</a></p>
<h3>Health Studies</h3>
<p>Formerly the Bradford and <a>Airedale</a> College of Health, this became part of the university in 1996; previously it was an associate college with the university validating its degrees and diplomas. It is currently located on a separate site on Trinity Road, about 10 minutes walk from the main campus and near to <a>St. Luke's Hospital</a>. However, the school will move to the main city campus in 2011, into the Horton A Building, currently undergoing major refurbishment work. The Horton building will be extended and another floor added to accommodate the School of Health Studies.</p>
<p>It specialises in courses in <a>nursing</a>, <a>physiotherapy</a>, <a>midwifery</a>, <a>occupational therapy</a> and <a>radiography</a>. A specialist <a>drug therapy</a> course is run by the department and there are also part-time courses in <a>dementia</a> care. The department's student demographics are largely female, with a higher proportion of mature students. <img></p>
<h3>Computing, Informatics and Media</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Digital Arts Centre in the School of Computing, Informatics &amp; Media</a>The second-largest school in the university consists of the departments of <a>Computing</a>, Bradford Media School (BMS), Creative Technology (CT) and Mathematics. It was renamed from the School of Informatics to the School of Computing, Informatics &amp; Media (SCIM) in 2009 when the department of Electronic Imaging and Media Communications (EIMC) was split to CT and BMS. SCIM offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and postgraduate study in various areas including computing, ICT, <a>robotics</a>, mathematics, media and television. The School has a very lively research culture with over 100 students registered for MPhil/PhD.</p>
<p>The School was originally known as the &quot;Department of Computing&quot; and subsequently as the &quot;School of Computing and Mathematics&quot;, following the integration of <a>mathematics</a> activities after the decision to close the Department of Mathematics as a separate entity in 1997. Mathematics was revived as a separate department in 2009 and now offers a degree in Computational Mathematics. The Department of Computing was one of the first in the UK to run an MSc course in Computing back in 1967. Undergraduate courses began in 1970. Most of the school's computing courses are accredited by the <a>British Computer Society</a> (BCS).</p>
<p>The EIMC department was founded in 1991 and developed its courses in conjunction with the School of Art, Design &amp; Textiles at Bradford and Ilkley Community College (now known as Bradford College) and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (now the <a>National Media Museum</a>). The first cohort of 37 students graduated in 1994. It was one of the first departments to offer <a>BSc</a> courses in media technology, going on to introduce some of the first animation and computer games degrees, and more recently expanding to offer a new range of similar <a>BA</a> courses. Previous graduates have gone on to become notable and high-profile members in their field.  Today, SCIM no longer works in association with the college, but has strengthened its relationship with the nearby <a>National Media Museum</a>. The school would still claim to be leading the field, albeit against increasing competition. None of its competitors has a collaboration with a brand-leading museum. In association with the Department of Computing, it obtained a research grade 4 at <a>RAE</a> 2001.</p>
<p>A <a>non-linear</a> <a>Video editing</a> / training suite is named in honour of the Shipley born film director <a>Tony Richardson</a>, and was opened by his daughter, the film actress <a>Natasha Richardson</a> in 1996. It currently operates using [Final Cut Pro]. In 2007 the School launched a partnership with East Coast Media at the <a>Grimsby Institute</a> and the <a>National Media Museum</a> to bid for <a>Skillset</a> Media Academy status, which was granted in 2008. Accreditation mainly covers courses in the Bradford Media School.</p>
<p>The school was renamed Informatics when Computing was joined by the EIMC department. A department of Cybernetics was established around the time of the Mathematics department's demise, and its courses and staff were merged with those in Computing and EIMC in 2005 for financial reasons.</p>
<p>A core part of the school is the Innovations Unit, which offers the expertise of specialists within SCIM to commercial and social enterprises. This collaboration is part of a Government initiative called Knowledge Transfer, which also includes partnerships with national and international companies. The IIU is also home to &quot;Simula&quot;, which using knowledge transfer and resources for commercial projects including the school's <a>motion capture</a> suite for video games including <a>Driver Parallel Lines</a>, <a>World Snooker Championships</a> and <a>GTR</a>.</p>
<h3>Lifelong education and development</h3>
<p>Offers mostly part-time and specialist degrees, focusing on areas such as community regeneration and social studies. It also has a new <a>Combined Studies</a> degree and foundation year, and has for several years been noted for its research and teaching in Local and Regional Studies in which it also runs a part-time BA with Honours.</p>
<h3>Life Sciences</h3>
<p>The School of Life Sciences has the highest number of students of all of the schools, with more than 2,000 students admitted to a variety of undergraduate courses in the areas of <a>Biomedical Sciences</a>, <a>Chemical</a> and <a>Forensic Science</a>, Clinical Sciences, <a>Optometry</a>, <a>Pharmacy</a> and <a>Archaeological</a>, <a>Geographical</a> and <a>Environmental Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>Headed by the Dean, Professor Richard Greene, the school has an academic staff of over 100, with a support staff also of more than 100. The majority of academic staff is actively involved in research, which is supported with laboratory and workshop facilities, and by a team of technicians.</p>
<p>As a result of their research, the Bradford School of Pharmacy (BSP) has developed highly successful spin-off companies: Bradford Particle Design, which was sold to an American organisation and which has recently changed the name to Nektar Therapeutics, and AGT (Advanced Gel Technology) and AGT Life Sciences. The BSP has also undergone planned expansion with the new Institute of Pharmaceutical Innovation, which provides a hub for research across the School.  The building incorporates a new Analytical Centre which is available for use by staff across the University.</p>
<p>The Bradford School of Optometry and Vision Science (BSOVS) has its own Eye Clinic, situated on the nearby Science Park, providing <a>Primary Care</a> for the local community in conjunction with a student training facility. BSOVS also provides a variety of other clinical services (e.g. an Electro-diagnostic Unit opened October 2010) that people may be referred to by practitioners.</p>
<p>The Division of Chemical and Forensic Science runs a number of forensic science courses in conjunction with the Division of Biomedical Sciences and further undergraduate and postgraduate courses are being developed in the area of <a>Biotechnology</a>. The Division of Biomedical Sciences is also a major contributor to a new Clinical Sciences degree, which commenced in 2002.  Although the Division of Clinical Sciences provides a degree in its own right, as importantly there is provision for students to transfer to <a>Leeds Medical School</a>'s <a>MBChB</a> programme.</p>
<p>The Institute of Cancer Therapeutics has an excellent reputation for high calibre research and there is very close collaboration with staff from other divisions within the School. The ICT recently moved to a new on-campus building in October 2006.</p>
<p>The Division of Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences is located in refurbished, late 19th century mill buildings, housing extensive specialist facilities. Formerly a separate school, it was merged with Life Sciences in 2006.</p>
<h3>Bradford University School of Management</h3>
<p> The <a>Bradford School of Management</a> is located  away from the main campus on a  parkland campus, Emm Lane. It teaches courses in the realm of business, finance, <a>accountancy</a>, management and <a>marketing</a>. As of 2005 the department commenced teaching an accredited <a>LLB</a> <a>Law</a> degree.</p>
<p>It has a number of Masters degrees, <a>MBA</a> programmes and <a>doctoral</a> programmes running alongside undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>Bradford University School of Management is also a leading European business school, regularly appearing as one of the top ten in league tables such as the Financial Times. It work with large corporates such as <a>Asda</a>, the <a>BBC</a> and <a>Emirates</a>, as well as small businesses, providing management development, MBAs and research and graduate links. Its MBAs and undergraduates have some of the highest employment rates of any business school.</p>
<p>In 2005, the School of Management ranked 4th in the world for value of MBA program and 2nd in UK and 5th in Europe for its Master program by Financial Times.</p>
<p>According to Financial Times European Business School Rankings 2005 , School of Management achieved 20th out of 50 Best European B-schools and 10th in the UK.</p>
<p>Its research is both international and interdisciplinary and has five main research groups covering all the main areas of management, and co-operative links and exchange agreements with 20 universities in America, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Holland, Spain and Sweden.</p>
<p>School of Management has full <a>Economic and Social Research Council</a> (ESRC) accreditation for <a>DBA</a> and <a>PhD</a> programmes, portfolio Association of MBAs accreditation for MBA programmes and <a>EQUIS</a> accreditation as a School which only accredits to few best B-schools.</p>
<p>The School of Management is one of the oldest university schools of management in the UK, being one of the first to offer an MBA.</p>
<h3>Social and International Studies</h3>
<p>The School of Social and International Studies covers the areas of <a>sociology</a>, <a>psychology</a>, <a>economics</a>, <a>international relations</a>, <a>history</a> and <a>English</a>. It is also home to the world-renowned departments of <a>Peace Studies</a>, which was the first of its kind in the world, and the Department of Development and Economic Studies (DES), incorporating the Bradford Centre for International Development (BCID). The School offers a range of taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses and has a number of active research areas, especially in <a>conflict resolution</a> and <a>European Studies</a>. Popular courses in the department include a recently-launched Psychology course for undergraduates, accredited by the <a>British Psychological Society</a>, and <a>Social Work</a>, which is available in both under- and postgraduate forms. The school is actively engaged in the Programme for a Peaceful City initiative.</p>
<p>Its Languages department, formerly one of the university's flagship departments, closed recruitment to its undergraduate courses in <a>2006</a> and in <a>2008</a> did the same to its masters programme in <a>Interpreting and Translation</a>. The closure was blamed on fewer students taking languages as a <a>GCSE</a> or <a>A-level</a> subject and the subsequent loss of interest at degree-level.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>The University of Bradford is extremely diverse, with significant ethnic minority, mature, disabled, and international student populations.</p>
<p>In March 2006, four Bradford students were arrested and detained under the <a>Terrorism Act 2000</a>, on suspicion of <a>terrorism</a>-related offences.  In 2007, all four were tried and found guilty of possessing material for terrorist purposes.. This was quashed on appeal in February 2008 on the grounds that there was no proof of terrorist intent.</p>
<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>The University of Bradford Union</em> (UBU) is run by an executive committee of six full-time <a>sabbatical officer</a>s and up to six part-time executive officers, elected annually. The committee is unusual in not having a <a>Union President</a>: the post was abolished by Shumon Rahman in 2001, who was elected the Union's first Asian President in 2000.</p>
<p>The Union is located in the Communal Building on campus, and is politically active (nominally to the <a>left</a>), running regular campaigns. Prior to June 2009 there were two venues for night-time events - <em>The Basement</em> and <em>Escape</em> - these are closed for a year while the Communal Building is undergoing a multi-million pound refit.</p>
<p>The largest student involvement in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs (through the Athletics Association, commonly known as the AA), and the societies (through the Societies Federation). There is a wide variety of both, and students are free to start their own societies.</p>
<p>The Student Union also has <em><a>Ramair</a></em>, one of the UK's longest running student radio stations, as well as a student newspaper and a film society / cinema that screen professional <a>35 mm</a> cinema prints.</p>
