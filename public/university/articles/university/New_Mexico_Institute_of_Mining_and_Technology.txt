<p>  <strong>New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology</strong> (also called <strong>New Mexico Tech</strong>, and was originally known as the <strong>New Mexico School of Mines</strong>) is a university located in <a>Socorro, New Mexico</a>.  </p>
<p>Noted for its undergraduate and graduate school opportunities, New Mexico Tech offers over 30 bachelor of science degrees in <a>technology</a>, the <a>science</a>s, <a>engineering</a> (including <a>mineral engineering</a>), <a>management</a>, and <a>technical communication</a>, as well as graduate degrees at the masters and doctoral levels. New Mexico Tech is considered one of the best small science and engineering schools in <a>North America</a>. A recent National Science Foundation study of Baccalaureate Origins of S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients in the U.S. ranked New Mexico Tech as 15th in the nation, as well as the number one ranked public institution .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>New Mexico Tech is a relatively small (approximately 2000 students as of 2010) research- and teaching-oriented university focused on science and engineering. The institution was founded by the New Mexico Territorial Legislature in the year 1889 as the New Mexico School of Mines to both boost the territorial economy and teach mining specialties on the college level.  During the 1930s, petroleum engineering and technology also became an important field of study at the institute. In 1946, New Mexico Tech began offering graduate degrees. The institute adopted its current name in 1951, but the change was not legally effective until 1960, when its name was changed by an amendment of the New Mexico State Constitution, Art.XII, Section 11.</p>
<h2>Research and Teaching</h2>

<p><a>thumb|250px|&quot;M&quot; Mountain|&quot;M&quot; Mountain (Altamirano can be seen to the left and South Hall to the right of that)</a>New Mexico Tech's well-known areas of research and teaching include <a>hydrology</a>, <a>astrophysics</a>, <a>atmospheric physics</a>, <a>geophysics</a>, <a>information technology</a>, <a>information security</a>, <a>Earth Science</a>, energetic <a>materials engineering</a>, and <a>petroleum</a> recovery.  Federal funding from the <a>Department of Homeland Security</a> and other sources has fostered significant training and research programs in this area (even going so far as to allow the university to purchase <a>Playas, New Mexico</a>, a former company town, as a field site). Because of its especially strong research programs, the school offers numerous scholarships and unique research opportunities for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, with a very high professor to student ratio of approximately one professor per twelve students. In addition to its strong focus on science and technology, New Mexico Tech has seen much recent growth in the humanities and social sciences. Minors are now available in <a>history</a>, <a>Latin America</a>n studies, and <a>philosophy</a>, in addition to minors in science and engineering fields. The university's most recent <a>NCA</a> reaccreditation was in October 2004.</p>

<h2>National Center of Academic Excellence</h2>
<p>The school is a <a>National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE)</a>.  This brings several major scholarships and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<h2>School Culture and Student Life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Altamirano|Ben D. Altamirano Student Apartments</a> <a>thumb|250px|Athletic Field|Athletic Field</a>NMT hosts an annual <a>Performing Arts Series</a> that is free to students, and, along with the broader Socorro <a>community, city, and county</a>, supports a great number of special events each year. New Mexico Tech is located approximately an hour south of <a>Albuquerque</a> in a region of high deserts to subalpine mountains that offers considerable outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock climbing, road and <a>mountain biking</a>, a <a>triathlon</a>, and hiking opportunities.     New Mexico Tech also hosts numerous active <a>student clubs</a>, a Part 15 AM <a>radio station</a>, and a biweekly student newspaper, <a>Paydirt</a>.  The campus also includes an 18-hole championship <a>golf course</a>.</p>
<p>The campus population has historically been predominantly male, but it has moved increasing towards a balance between the sexes, with women now equal with men in most majors. The recently admitted class of 2013 has an overall male to female ratio of approximately 3:1, but this ratio is highly variable between departments. </p>
<p>New Mexico Tech has nine different halls/apartments for students: West Hall (Male Only), Driscoll Hall (Female Only), Presidents (Co-Ed), Baca, and South Halls (Co-Ed), Ben D. Altamirano Student Apartments, Desert Willow Apartments, and Mountain Springs Apartments</p>
<p>The campus also has a 150,000 gallon outdoor swimming pool that goes from a depth of 4 feet to 11 feet. During the winter months, it is covered to allow swimming to continue during cold weather. </p>
<p>New Mexico Tech now has social Greek Letter organizations as of the 2007-2008 school year. <a>Kappa Sigma</a> an all male fraternity and <a>Alpha Sigma Kappa</a> a social sorority for women in technical fields.</p>
<p>Each summer, NMT hosts the <a>Summer Science Program</a>, which teaches astronomy to high school students.</p>
<h2>New Mexico Tech on Television</h2>
<p>Several television shows have focused on New Mexico Tech faculty, students, and research. <a>TruTV</a>'s <em><a>Man vs. Cartoon</a></em> features attempts by Tech's <a>Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center</a> to re-create contraptions and situations found in <a>Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner</a> cartoons.  <em><a>Mythbusters</a></em>, <em><a>National Geographic Explorer</a></em>, and <em><a>Nova</a></em> have also featured Tech in various episodes.
