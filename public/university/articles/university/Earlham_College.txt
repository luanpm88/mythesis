<p>  <strong>Earlham College</strong> is a <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Richmond, Indiana</a>. It was founded in 1847 by the <a>Quakers</a> and has approximately 1,200 students.  The current president is <a>Douglas C. Bennett</a>. In keeping with <a>Friends</a>' belief in equality, everyone addresses each other at Earlham by his or her first name, without the use of titles such as &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;professor&quot;; likewise, &quot;freshmen&quot; are referred to as &quot;first year (student)(s)&quot;. </p>
<pre>  </pre>
<p>While Earlham is primarily a residential undergraduate college, it also has two graduate programs &#x2014; the master of arts in teaching and the master of education &#x2014; which provide a route for teacher licensure to students with liberal arts undergraduate degrees. </p>
<p>Earlham College is listed in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s book, <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>. In 2009, <a>Forbes</a> ranked it 91st of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Earlham&#x2019;s  campus lies at the southwestern edge of <a>Richmond, Indiana</a>, a city of 39,124 (2000 census). The main quadrangle of the campus is called &quot;the Heart.&quot;  It is surrounded by Earham Hall (with the Runyan Center student union directly behind it), Olvey-Andis Hall, Lily Library, Carpenter Hall, Landrum Bolling Center, the science buildings (Stanley Hall, Noyes Hall and Dennis Hall), Tyler Hall, Bundy Hall and Barrett Hall. Eighty-seven percent of Earlham students live on campus in a variety of settings. The campus includes eight residence halls (Barrett Hall, Bundy Hall, Earlham Hall, Mills Hall, Hoerner Hall, Olvey-Andis Hall, Warren Hall and Wilson Hall) and 28 theme and friendship houses, which border the North and East edges of the campus. <a>U.S. Route 40</a> runs along the edge of the campus.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left| Carpenter Hall at Earlham College</a>The Joseph Moore <a>Museum</a> is a <a>natural</a> <a>history</a> museum located on campus and run by students and biology <a>department</a> faculty, focusing on <a>Indiana</a>'s <a>natural history</a>. It is open to the public (free of charge) and <a>tours</a> are available upon request. The majority of Earlham College's campus is undeveloped <a>forest</a> and <a>meadow</a>, including the undeveloped &quot;back campus&quot; area, which serves as an outdoor <a>classroom</a>.</p>
<p>Earlham College has been singled out in the <a>National Wildlife Federation</a>'s national report card on sustainability in higher education as having exemplary programs.  Earham's Environmental Plan (approved 2005) is an assessment of how Earlham impacts the environment, what steps have been or can be taken to reduce impacts.</p>
<h2>Curriculum and community</h2>
<p>Earlham is nationally recognized for its strong programs in <a>Biology</a>, <a>Japanese Studies</a>, <a>Peace and Global Studies</a> and German (two students recently received Fulbright scholarships in German). The Earlham libraries are known for their course-integrated program of <a>information</a> <a>literacy</a> instruction. Notably, Earlham ranks 8th in the nation (out of 1,302 colleges and universities) in its <a>percentage</a> of graduates who go on to receive a <a>Ph.D</a>. in the <a>biological</a> sciences and 26th in the percentage of students going on to Ph.D. programs in all fields. Earlham is known for its &quot;Super Languages&quot; program where a full year of a language is taught intensively for one <a>semester</a>.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of Earlham students go on a semester-length <a>off-campus program</a> to such destinations as <a>Mexico</a>, the U.S./ Mexican border, <a>Vienna</a>, <a>Martinique</a>, <a>Northern Ireland</a>, <a>Great Britain</a>, <a>France</a>, <a>Germany</a>, <a>Spain</a>, <a>New Zealand</a> , <a>Japan</a> and <a>Tanzania</a>. In <a>addition</a>, there are a number of shorter off-campus May terms, with destinations both within the U.S. and abroad (<a>Australia</a>, <a>Galapagos</a>, <a>Senegal</a>, <a>Menorca</a>, and <a>Turkey</a>, as recent examples). Earlham has an exchange program with <a>Waseda University</a> in <a>Japan</a>, which has existed informally for decades. In addition, Earlham College works with the <a>SICE</a> program in <a>Morioka</a>, <a>Japan</a>, a program in which about twelve to fourteen students teach <a>English</a> in <a>middle school</a>s in <a>Morioka</a>.</p>
<p>Earlham has an entirely student-managed public <a>radio station</a>, <a>WECI</a> 91.5FM.</p>
<p>Earlham College is a member of the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>.</p>
<h2>Adjacent Institutions</h2>
<p>There are two institutions located adjacent to the Earlham College undergraduate campus: <a>Earlham School of Religion</a>, a Quaker theological graduate school and <a>Bethany Theological Seminary</a>, an independent <a>Church of the Brethren</a> institution offering graduate and non-degree programs. Earlham College students can take courses at these institutions (which share facilities with the college).</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Earham competes in NCAA Division III. The women's sports are basketball, cross country, field hockey, indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, tennis, and volleyball. The men's sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, and tennis. Earlham College was a member of the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a> and starting in Fall 2010 will be a member of the <a>HCAC</a>. Earlham has won championships in men's <a>cross country</a> . The athletics teams are known as the Quakers. They originally had been the Fightin' Quakers; although the name was meant tongue-in-cheek, it was changed in the 1980s to the Hustlin' Quakers after the college's board of regents decided that it was inappropriate for Quakers to fight. In the 1990s, the name was changed again to simply Quakers. Perhaps the Quakers' most notable football game was against Japan's Doshisha University Hamburgers in 1989.</p>
<p>Earlham has many Club teams: some of the more successful ones are Ultimate Frisbee, Women's and Men's rugby. Other club teams are Bike Co-Op, Cheerleaders, Earthquakers (Competitive Dance), Equestrian Program, Martial Arts Co-Op, Men's Volleyball, and Outdoors Club. A $13-million Athletics and Wellness Center opened at the beginning of the Fall 1999 semester. Students are not charged to use the facility It features an energy center for cardiovascular and strength training, a group fitness studio for aerobics and yoga, Weber Pool (25 meters by six lanes), racquetball courts, tennis courts, a running track, a climbing wall and Schuckman Court (a performance gymnasium with seating for 1,800).</p>
<p>Among the student body, the chant sometimes sung publicly is</p>
<p>:Fight, Fight, Inner Light!  :Kill, Quakers, Kill! :Knock 'em Down, Beat 'em Senseless! :Do It 'til We Reach Consensus!</p>
<p>Also: :Fight, Fight, Inner Light!  :Kill, Quakers, Kill! :Beat 'em, Beat 'em, Knock 'em Senseless! :Tell Me, Do We Have Consensus?</p>
<p>A popular cheer that was emoted by the Earlham College Fightin' Quakers football <a>cheerleaders</a> (circa 1979), when the opposing team had possession of the ball, was:</p>
<p>:Fight exuberantly! :Fight exuberantly! :Compel them to relinquish the ball!</p>
<p>An earlier cheer was:</p>
<p>:Rock 'em. sock 'em! :Knock 'em in the mud! :Shake 'em, brake 'em! :We want blood! :Kill, Quakers, kill! Kill!</p>
<h2>Wilderness programs</h2>
<p>Earlham was one of the first colleges in the country to initiate student and faculty led wilderness programs, back in 1970 . These programs were designed for incoming first-year and transfer students who received credit for them. The program is divided into the Water August Wilderness and the Mountain August Wilderness and lasts for approximately three weeks; the former canoes in Wabakimi Provincial park in Ontario and the latter hikes in the Uinta Mountains in Utah. Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit. The program in the past has lead spring break canoeing trips to  <a>Big Bend National Park</a> in southwestern <a>Texas</a>, a semester course to  New Zealand and a  May Term (a condensed three-week term after the spring semester) instructor training  course for its August Wilderness program. Challege/experiential education courses on the college's own high and low ropes is offered as well as opportunities to be certified as Wilderness First Responders.  </p>
<p>Earlham College remains the only American institution of <a>tertiary education</a> that allows students to study <a>aardvark</a>s extensively in their <a>native</a> <a>habitat</a> in the <a>Kakamega Forest</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Earlham's &quot;dry campus&quot; policy is controversial among members of the student body and some faculty members. Drinking is fairly commonplace; some students refer to the campus as &quot;pleasantly moist.&quot; In August 2007, as part of New Student Orientation for the incoming class of 2011, the Earlham faculty revealed their new approach to dealing with alcohol issues. Although the official alcohol policy remains the same, the primary focus is now on education and personal responsibility, as opposed to enforcement.</p>
<p>Tension sometimes arises between students and the Quaker <a>Indiana</a> and Western Yearly Meetings over issues of sexuality. Western and, to an even greater degree, Indiana Yearly Meeting tend to be more conservative on issues such as <a>condom</a> distribution, <a>pregnancy</a>, and <a>homosexuality</a>. This tension has been a recurrent feature of Earlham life for decades.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Committee on Campus Life approved a new pregnancy policy, stating that pregnant women may reside in on-campus housing, but are also offered a housing exemption if they so desire.</p>
<p>Most students stay on-campus during the weekends. The Student Activities Board, Earlham Film Series, student bands, theater productions, etc. offer a variety of activities on the weekends.</p>
<p>In March 2005, <a>William Kristol</a>, founder and editor of <em><a>The Weekly Standard</a></em>, was hit in the face with an ice cream pie by a student during a lecture he gave on campus. This event made <a>nation</a>al and <a>international</a> news and was carried by many leading news outlets. Many students and faculty at the lecture showed strong disapproval of the act, and applauded when Kristol resumed his talk. The event sharply divided students and, to a lesser extent, faculty, with some showing support for the act of pieing and most showing strong disapproval. Many, however, felt that the act was unjustly punished by the President (who was also indirectly hit by the pie). The student was subsequently suspended for the rest of the semester and dropped out the following year. Additionally, President Doug Bennett overturned a College Judiciary Council ruling that found the students who knew about the pieing ahead of time not guilty; this act further divided the campus. Shortly after the incident, conservative commentators <a>Pat Buchanan</a> and <a>David Horowitz</a> were 'attacked' (with salad dressing and a pie, respectively) and a 'teach-in' at Earlham was conducted which featured three faculty members sharing their views. Several years <em>ex post facto</em>, the pieing, the punishment, and whether William Kristol should have even been invited to speak at Earlham all continue to be issues of contention amongst the faculty and student body.</p>
<h3>The Hash</h3>
<p>Earlham has the only student-run <a>Hash House Harriers</a> running group, founded in 1989 and still continuing at present (2010). While only loosely connected with national organizations, the student group maintains weekly runs and has been described by visitors as the &quot;Galapagos of Hashes&quot; for the creativity and development of hashing practices. The Hash run takes place on the &quot;back campus,&quot; which may include the back property of the neighboring cemetery, during all seasons. The Campus Safety and Security office and Student Development office share concern about the event and do not condone its happening. The Campus Safety and Security team has requested that the event be brought to an end via an article in the student-run newspaper, The Earlham Word.</p>
