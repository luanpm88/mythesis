<h2>Campuses </h2>
<p><a>thumb|Aalto Campus, Main Building (1954-56)</a> The faculties and departments are mainly located on three campuses: the Main Campus area in the city centre - where the original Teacher Seminary has first started - as well as Mattilanniemi and Ylist&#x00f6;nrinne Campuses on opposite shores of Lake Jyv&#x00e4;sj&#x00e4;rvi, united by a bridge, some 10 minutes walk from the Main Campus area.</p>
<p>Several buildings in the main campus area were designed by famous Finnish architect <a>Alvar Aalto</a>. Aalto received the commission to design the College of Education campus following a competition held in 1951. Aalto played on the idea of Jyv&#x00e4;skyl&#x00e4;'s image among the town's inhabitants as it being the &quot;Athens of the North&quot;, and layout of the campus reflects principles of Greek acropolis layouts. His scheme even included a Greek-style open-air theatre, though executed in minimal form.  </p>
<p>Buildings in the campus area designed by Alvar Aalto:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Teachers Training School 1951-54</li>
  <li>Staff housing 1951 (now the Jyv&#x00e4;skyl&#x00e4; University Museum)</li>
  <li>Student&#x2019;s Hall of Residence 1952-54 (now the languages department)</li>
  <li>Lozzi and Lyhty staff and student refectories</li>
  <li>Main Building 1954-56</li>
  <li>Swimming Pool 1954-58, 1964, several alterations (called Aalto-Alvari)</li>
  <li>Physical Education Building 1971</li>
  <li>Library 1957 (now the Aalto Reading Room)</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1969-70 an architectural competition was arranged for the design of new university campus sites at Mattilanniemi and Ylist&#x00f6;nrinne. The competition was won by architect <a>Arto Sipinen</a>, who had previously worked in Aalto's office. Sipinen also designed new buildings for the main campus, including a new main library (1974).</p>
