<p></p>
<p><strong>Trinity University</strong> is a private, independent, primarily <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>university</a> in <a>San Antonio</a>, <a>Texas</a>. Its campus is located in the <a>Monte Vista Historic District</a> and adjacent to Brackenridge Park.</p>
<p>The student body consists of over 2,400 undergraduate and 200 graduate students, and awarded 649 degrees in 2007-2008. The university employs 243 full-time faculty and 83 part-time or adjunct faculty members in 2009. The university offers 39 majors and 52 minors among 6 degree programs.  The enlarged endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus in its &#x201c;University on the Hill&#x201d; location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining an extremely high faculty to student ratio.  This in turn allowed Trinity to be more selective in student recruitment.  This work was continued by Laurie&#x2019;s successor Ronald Calgaard.  Former president <a>John R. Brazil</a> focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The &quot;Campaign for Trinity University,&quot; which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US $200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the Campaign raised US $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.   On January 23, 2009 it was announced that Dr. Brazil would retire as Trinity's President in January 2010. That same day he was awarded Trinity's Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor, by the Board of Trustees.  On September 25, 2009 it was announced that Dr. Dennis Ahlburg would assume the presidency in January 2010. </p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Trinity overlooks downtown San Antonio, adjacent to the Monte Vista Historic District and just south of the <a>Olmos Park</a> and <a>Alamo Heights</a> neighborhoods. The  Skyline Campus, the university's fourth location, is noted for its distinctive red brick architecture and well-maintained grounds, modeled after an Italian village by late architect <a>O'Neil Ford</a>.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The environmental movement at Trinity is known as Red Bricks, Green Campus. Trinity is a member of the <a>Presidents' Climate Commitment</a> and is actively working towards carbon neutrality. Trinity was ranked 5th in the RecycleMania Challenge. Students pushed for fair trade options, and now all coffee sold at the university is certified fair trade. In 2009, Trinity University scored a C- on the <a>College Sustainability Report Card</a>, also known as the Green Report Card.  </p>
<h3>Notable buildings and structures</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The  tall Murchison Tower is the most dominant landmark on the campus, designed, as many other buildings on campus, by <a>O'Neil Ford</a>, who also designed San Antonio Landmark the <a>Tower of the Americas</a> a few years later based on this design. It was previously the highest point in San Antonio. The tower is now lit at night (excepting evenings when the lighting interferes with on-campus astronomical observances), a tradition begun on September 22, 2002 to commemorate Trinity's 60th anniversary in San Antonio.</li>
  <li>Laurie Auditorium seats 2,865 and hosts both campus and community events. The university has many lecture series, such as the high profile Trinity Distinguished Lecture Series [<a>http://web.trinity.edu/x1481.xml</a>], Stieren Arts Enrichment Series, Nobel Economists Lecture Series [<a>http://www.trinity.edu/nobel/</a>], and Flora Cameron Lecture on Politics and Public Affairs. Guest lectures at Laurie Auditorium occur routinely throughout the academic year and have included <a>Henry Kissinger</a>, <a>Tony Blair</a>, <a>George H.W. Bush</a> (former Trustee of the University), <a>Ken Burns</a>, <a>Condoleeza Rice</a>, <a>Pervez Musharaff</a> <a>Colin Powell</a>, <a>Carl Sagan</a>, <a>Desmond Tutu</a>, <a>Bob Dole</a>, <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>, <a>John Major</a>, <a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a>Thomas Friedman</a>, <a>Charles Krauthamer</a>, <a>Jos&#x00e9; Mar&#x00ed;a Aznar</a>, <a>Tom Brokaw</a>, <a>John Edwards</a>, <a>Gerhard Schr&#x00f6;der</a>, <a>Doris Kearns Goodwin</a>, <a>David Kay</a>, <a>Queen Noor</a>, <a>John Glenn</a>, Lord <a>George Robertson</a>, <a>Benazir Bhutto</a>, <a>Lech Wa&#x0142;&#x0119;sa</a>, <a>Madeleine Albright</a>, <a>Thomas Kean</a>, <a>Brit Hume</a>, <a>Barbara Bush</a>, <a>Rudolph Giuliani</a>, <a>Michael Beschloss</a>, <a>Shimon Peres</a>, <a>Jimmy Carter</a>, <a>Gerald Ford</a>, <a>John Updike</a>,  <a>Lawrence Eagleburger</a>, <a>Mario Cuomo</a>, <a>William Bennett</a>, <a>Jimmy Carter</a>, <a>Juan Williams</a>, <a>Pierre Salinger</a>, <a>Sam Nunn</a>, <a>Vicente Fox</a>, <a>Dan Rather</a>, <a>Dominique de Villepin</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a> (organised by the San Antonio Business Council) and <a>John Cleese</a>.</li>
  <li>The  Elizabeth Huth Coates Library houses (as of 2007) 937,000 books and bound periodical volumes.  The library, an advanced facility for a school of Trinity's size, also houses over 200,000 volumes of government documents, over 1.3 million microforms, over 65,000 media items, and maintains 2,400 periodical subscriptions and access to over 20,000 electronic periodicals.   The library's annual acquisition budget is over US $1.5 million. [<a>http://lib.trinity.edu/libinfo/factsheet.pdf</a>] In 2007, the library was awarded the Excellence in Academic Libraries Award from the <a>Association of College and Research Libraries</a> (ACRL). Sponsored by ACRL and Blackwell&#x2019;s Book Services, the award recognizes the staff of a college library for programs that deliver exemplary services and resources to further the educational mission of the institution.[<a>http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/070101libraryaward.htm</a>]</li>
  <li>In 2006, the Jim and Janet Dicke Art Building, the Campbell and Eloise Smith Music Building, and the Ruth Taylor Recital Hall were substantially renovated under the guidance of <a>Kell Mu&#x00f1;oz Architects</a>, providing greatly improved facilities and 20,000 additional square feet of space. The building subsequently won a merit award for design from the City of San Antonio in 2008 [<a>http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/060413ruthtaylorreno.htm</a>]</li>
  <li>The Margarite B. Parker Chapel seats six hundred and is known for its large Hofmann-Ballard <a>pipe organ</a>, the largest pipe organ in South Texas. comprising 5 divisions, 102 <a>stops</a>, 112 ranks, and over 6000 pipes. A state-of-the art four-manual console was installed in Summer 2007, with the aid of the University's Calvert Trust Fund [<a>http://www.keggorgan.com/</a>]. Non-denominational services are led by the campus chaplain Sunday evenings.</li>
  <li>The newly constructed Northrup Hall, finished in 2004 and designed by <a>Robert A. M. Stern</a> Architects, is used for administrative and faculty offices and classrooms.</li>
  <li>Sixteen residence halls - as a residential campus, students are required to live on campus for three years and many stay for their fourth. As a result, Trinity has a variety of residence halls located on lower campus. Halls reserved for first-year students include Beze, Calvert, Herndon, Miller, Winn and Witt. Upperclassmen halls include Isabel, Lightner, Murchison, Myrtle, North, Prassel, Thomas, South and Susanna. One residence hall, McLean, houses both first-year and upperclass students.</li>
  <li>The Coates University Center houses an information desk, dining areas, post office, bookstore, bar, meeting rooms, offices and a number of student organizations.</li>

<h2>Academics &amp; Rankings</h2>
<p>The university offers 39 majors and 52 minors in the traditional <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>sciences</a>, <a>fine arts</a>, and <a>engineering</a>, and graduate programs in <a>accounting</a>, <a>teaching</a>, <a>school psychology</a>, <a>school administration</a>, and <a>health care administration</a>.  Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 10:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a <a>Ph.D</a>. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 52% of the student body has studied abroad, in over 35 countries.</p>
<p>Trinity was recognized by the <a>Princeton Review</a> in their 2009 edition of <em>The Best 368 Colleges</em>, its annual college guide, and has featured in the guide since its first publication. In its &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; ranking, <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> placed Trinity first among universities granting primarily bachelor's and select master's degrees in the western United States  for 19 straight years.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>[[Image:Coates LibrarySA.jpg|280px|thumb|right|The [[Mural]] inside the Coates Library is a familiar sight to many students.]] Trinity hosts several local social <a>fraternities and sororities</a>. Fraternities include Iota Chi Rho, Bengal Lancers, Chi Delta Tau, Kappa Kappa Delta, Omega Phi, and Phi Sigma Chi. Sororities include Alpha Chi Lambda, Chi Beta Epsilon, Gamma Chi Delta, Phi Delta Kappa, Sigma Theta Tau, SPURS, and Zeta Chi. </p>
<p>One fraternity, Alpha Theta Chi, dissolved their charter and left the university voluntarily due to judicial violations during the 2007-2008 academic year. Two other fraternities, the Triniteers and Alpha Delta Epsilon had charters revoked for hazing violations, and do not exist officially.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, Trinity's first colony of a national Greek organization, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, often shortened to Pikes, was officially recognized by the school. Pi Kappa Alpha would receive its charter in late 2009, making it the only national Greek fraternity or sorority on campus, and, with its 81 members, the largest. The move led to controversy amongst the local greek organizations, who did not support the inclusion of a national fraternity. Subsequently, a shake-up in the administration occurred following the new charter, and individuals were removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the school hosts chapters of several academic honor organizations, including Blue Key, Mortar Board, and <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>. The school also has a couple of national <a>co-ed</a> organizations, <a>Alpha Kappa Psi</a> (Nu Pi Chapter), a national co-ed business fraternity, <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> (Delta Pi Chapter) a national <a>co-ed</a> service fraternity, and <a>Phi Alpha Delta</a>, an international co-ed Pre-Law fraternity.</p>
<p>Service opportunities can be found through the largest single student organization, the Trinity University Voluntary Action Community, or TUVAC, which provides opportunities for students to give back to the surrounding community. The national <a>co-ed</a> service fraternity <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> is also represented. Student government takes the form of the Association of Student Representatives which oversees the Trinity University Honor Council, TIGER Council, the Trinity Multicultural Network, and a Student Conduct Board. The Trinity University Student Ambassadors maintain Trinity traditions and encourage philanthropic activity among students, alumni, and friends of the University.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of interest groups attract students. Religious organizations include The Well, <a>InterVarsity</a>, the <a>Fellowship of Christian Athletes</a>, <a>Jewish</a> Student Association, <a>Catholic</a> Student Group, the <a>Muslim</a> Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship, and Students Creating Awareness of the <a>Sikh</a> Faith. Cultural and ethnic groups include the Asian Sub-Continental Association, African Student Association, Black Student Union, Chinese Culture Club, Filipino Student Association, International Club, Latino Exchange, the <a>Hindu</a> Student Union, the <a>Gaelic</a> Cultural Society, Sexual Diversity Alliance, and the Vietnamese Student Association. Political interests can be pursued in College Republicans, College Democrats, and the Coalition for Peace and Justice. </p>
<p>Trinity's radio station, KRTU 91.7 FM [<a>http://web.krtu.org/</a>], broadcasts <a>jazz</a> during the day, the only station in San Antonio to do so. At night, students, and a good deal of the station's community volunteers play <a>indie rock</a>. TigerTV serves as the campus TV station.  In addition to movies, the channel broadcasts three main shows: Studio 21, Newswave, and the Not So Late Show. The Not So Late Show also includes a show titled The Floor. Both the campus radio station and television station have undergone renovations with funding from <a>AT&amp;T</a>, bringing them in line with the best studios in the country. The Trinitonian [<a>http://web.trinity.edu/x2883.xml</a>] has been the weekly campus newspaper for 103 years, and has a print circulation of 2,500. </p>
<p>Intramural sports are also popular at Trinity. Students may participate in swimming, flag football, racquetball, table tennis, cross country, indoor and outdoor soccer, the home run derby, track and field, wrestling, tennis, volleyball, basketball, checkers, chess and spades.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Trinity's Bell Center serves as the hub of athletic activity on campus</a> Organized traditions at Trinity over the years have included students climbing Murchison Tower at the beginning and end of their time at Trinity, the Last Great Reception, the Golf Cart Parade during the homecoming football game, TigerFest, the Ring Ceremony, Spotlight, the talent show, and Christmas Vespers, a candlelit Christmas concert. Traditions that students perpetuate through word of mouth include being thrown into the Miller fountain on one's birthday and sorority candelights to announce engagements. Another recent tradition, reserved solely for first-years, is &quot;Calvert Ghosts&quot; in which the residents of Calvert Hall cover themselves in nothing but flour and streak through the first-year quad on Halloween Night.  Originally this tradition was specifically for the third floor of the residence hall, which was traditionally male.  However, for the 2003-2004 school year, residential changes led to a reversal of the floor's gender assignment. In response, students from other floors (and residence halls) cobbled together a traditionally male ancillary streaking expedition, though some females joined in as well. Tempered by this hardship, the tradition continues in a co-ed incarnation that is less Calvert-centric, welcoming students from all floors of Calvert, as well as from neighboring halls.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, various traditions have fallen to the wayside.  These include the Sperm and Ova dance (done during the homecoming football game), Senior Disorientation (a full year celebration for graduating seniors), The Rites of Spring (a springtime celebration on Prassel Lawn), and Primal Scream (an organized stress release prior to finals), and Spontaneous Erections (constructions made from random objects that showed up overnight on the Esplanade).  To take their place, new student traditions have been introduced, including a procession to Laurie Auditorium from the Esplanade prior to the first year convocation, and from Laurie Auditorium to the Esplanade following graduation ceremonies.  Other new traditions include the Chocolate Festival, Trinity Idol, and &quot;This is my story,&quot; a variety show that demonstrates the diversity of life experiences of Trinity students.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> The <strong>Trinity Tigers</strong> is <a>the nickname for</a> the sports teams of Trinity University. They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division III</a> and the <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a>.  The school mascot is LeeRoy, a <a>Bengal Tiger</a>.  In the 1950s, LeeRoy was an actual tiger who was brought to sporting events, but today LeeRoy is portrayed by a student wearing a tiger suit.</p>
<p>Trinity has historically had a strong <a>tennis</a> program.  Under the tutelage of Coach Clarence Mabry, Trinity player Chuck McKinley won the Wimbledon singles championship in 1963 and was rated the number one men's singles player in the world. With partner Dennis Ralston, McKinley won the US men's doubles championship in 1961, 1963, and 1964. McKinley and Ralston also played all of the matches while winning the Davis Cup for the US in 1963.  All of these accomplishments occurred while McKinley was a Trinity undergraduate. In 1972 Trinity won the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship. The tiger captain that year, Dick Stockton, won the NCAA men's singles championship. The women's team won the <a>USTA</a> collegiate national <a>championship</a> in 1968, 1969, 1973, 1975, and 1976. As recently as 2000, the men's and women's programs each won NCAA Division III national championships. Trinity also has won national championships in women's <a>basketball</a> (Spring 2003) and men's <a>soccer</a> (Fall 2003). Club sports include men's and women's Tennis, <a>Lacrosse</a>, <a>Water Polo</a>, <a>Fencing</a>, and <a>Trap</a> and <a>Skeet</a>.  The unlikely play was named the top sports moment of the year by <a>Time Magazine</a> [<a>http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686305_1690598,00.html</a>] as well as the &quot;Game Changing Performance of the Year&quot; by <a>Pontiac</a> [<a>http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/Pontiac_GCPOY.htm</a>] [<a>https://r.espn.go.com/espn/contests/07GameChangingPerformance/index?cmp=ncaavanurl</a>]. <a>right|thumb|Men's football team, 1915</a></p>
