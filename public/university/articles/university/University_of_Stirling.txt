<p>The <strong>University of Stirling</strong> is a <a>campus university</a> founded by <a>Royal charter</a> in 1967, on the Airthrey Estate in <a>Stirling</a>, <a>Scotland</a>. </p>
<h2>History and campus development</h2>
<p>The main campus is situated around 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) from the centre of <a>Stirling</a>, but is much closer to the town of <a>Bridge of Allan</a>. It was formerly the estate of the <a>Robert Adam</a>-designed <a>Airthrey Castle</a>, which the University has retained and incorporated into the campus as teaching facilities and offices. It is regularly described as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world, and nestles at the foot of <a>Abbey Craig</a> and the <a>Ochil Hills</a> in 300 acres (1.2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of grounds centred around the 18th century man-made Airthrey Loch.  In 2002, the University of Stirling and the landscape of the Airthrey Estate was designated by the <a>International Council on Monuments and Sites</a> as one of the top 20 heritage sites of the 20th century within the UK. When the University first received its <a>Royal Charter</a> on 13 November 1967, there were 164 undergraduate and 31 postgraduate students. Around 45,000 students have graduated since. The University of Stirling however has a relatively small student population, <a>ranking 87th</a> in the UK. 92.2% of undergraduates currently enter from <a>state school</a>s or <a>further education</a>. </p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Looking out over Airthrey Loch towards the University's Library and central administrative hub, the Cottrell Building</a> The principal administrative and teaching facilities were originally housed in the Pathfoot Building, which was completed in 1968 and subsequently saw several extensions over the years, including a Tropical <a>Aquarium</a> in 1979 and a <a>Virology</a> unit in 1987. In 1993 the Pathfoot Building was selected by the international conservation organisation <a>DoCoMoMo</a> as one of <a>sixty key Scottish monuments</a> of the <a>post-war</a> era. It was also voted as one of <a>Prospect's 100 best modern Scottish buildings</a>. A house for the University Principal was also completed in 1967. Designed by the architects <a>Morris and Steedman</a>, it was <a>listed</a> at category A in 2009. Pathfoot was later complemented by the Cottrell Building, which began development in 1970 and houses numerous <a>lecture</a> theatres, departmental offices, classrooms and computer labs. The Cottrell Building was further enhanced with the completion of the Courtroom extension in 1998 and in 2008/09 the entire building underwent a <a>fa&#x00e7;ade recladding</a> project. </p>
<p>The University Library and Andrew Miller Building were completed in 1971. The Library holds over 500,000 volumes, over 9,000 journals and reopened in August 2010 after a major refurbishment programme. The Andrew Miller Building incorporates an <a>Atrium</a>, which has several retail and food outlets, including a bookstore, <a>bank</a> and <a>general store</a>. The Atrium also acts as the principal hub for most day-to-day campus activities, due to its central location, linking together the Library and Robbins' Centre Students Union, as well as connecting bridges to both the Cottrell Building and on-campus student residences. The University's first Principal, Professor Tom Cottrell, believed that art should be part of the everyday cultural experience at the University, and his inspiration led to the establishment of the <a>MacRobert Arts Centre</a>, which is a small theatre and cinema complex, located adjacent to the Andrew Miller Building. The Centre is open both to members of the University community and to the general public. Stirling has also developed a considerable <a>fine art</a> collection since 1967, comprising over 300 works including; paintings, tapestries and sculpture. </p>
<p>A visit by <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> to the site in 1972 caused considerable controversy; student protests against the Queen's visit were vociferous and, in some cases, fuelled by alcohol, and the disturbances were widely condemned in the press and the local community, where students were refused access to buses and other facilities for a time.</p>
<p>As the University has continued to expand since its inception, further development has taken place including; the R.G. Bomont Building, which was completed in 1998, and houses the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, the Iris Murdoch building, opened in 2002 for The Dementia Services Development Centre, and the Colin Bell Building, completed in 2003 for the School of Applied Social Science.</p>
<p>In 2006, the University catered for nearly 9,000 students, around a third of whom live on-campus. There are several student <a>Halls of Residence</a> located on-campus, which include; Andrew Stewart Hall, A.K. Davidson Hall, Murray Hall, Geddes Court, Alexander Court and Muirhead House. There are also other halls of residence located off-campus, within Stirling city centre, including; Union Street and John Forty's Court. Students of over 80 nationalities are represented at the university, with 14 per cent of students coming from overseas. </p>
<p>The University has developed major industrial research links, with a large <a>science park</a> - Stirling University Innovation Park, located immediately adjacent to the main university campus. Innovation Park has grown since its initiation in 1993, and is now home to 40 companies engaging in various forms of <a>research and development</a>. The university also owns a highly successful International Conference Centre, Stirling Management Centre, which is located on campus, and is a purpose built conference and management training centre and the first Conference Centre of Excellence in Scotland.. The University admits in its own published estates strategy that the sale of part of its campus to the WANG computer manufacturer in the 1980s was a serious mistake. The sale was linked to the adoption by the University of the WANG computing system which was incompatible with other systems and was eventually replaced. The site went through various owners and is now a food processing facility. </p>
<p>The university chose not to defend a claim at an employment tribunal in 2009 in which it conceded it had unfairly dismissed a researcher who had claimed that a member of the psychology department had removed her name from a grant application and submitted it under his own. The university had rejected the researcher's complaint in its internal process.  It subsequently promoted Donaldson to a professorship. Donaldson issued a written apology to the researcher, and the university was required to pay her more than &#x00a3;10,000 in compensation..  </p>
<h3>Sport facilities</h3>
<p>[[Image:Wfm scottish institute of sport.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The headquarters of the [[Scottish Institute of Sport]] opened on campus in 2002.]] Stirling was designated as Scotland&#x2019;s University for Sporting Excellence by the Scottish Government in 2009, and is acknowledged as Scotland's leading university for sport, the University has a comprehensive range of sports facilities and is one of only sixteen universities in the UK with 5-star sports facilities. The University has its own 9-hole <a>Golf</a> course and <a>driving range</a>, and a host of other sporting facilities are located in and around the campus. The Gannochy National Tennis Centre on the University campus is recognised as a national centre of excellence, and also has an indoor 50 metre swimming pool, badminton and squash courts, gymnasium, sports halls and <a>all-weather</a> playing fields available for student, staff and public use. The campus has been selected as the headquarters for the <a>Scottish Institute of Sport</a>, the <a>Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland</a> and <a>Scottish Swimming</a>. A new 50-metre <a>swimming pool</a> was completed in 2002 as part of the Scottish National Swimming Academy.  Falkirk FC opened a football academy on campus in 2008, and the Scottish National Women's Football Academy opened in 2009.  Further development is planned. <a>Scholarship</a>s are available in six core sports: golf, swimming and disability swimming, tennis, football, tae kwondo and triathlon, which allows student athletes to prepare for international competition.</p>
<p><a>Stirling University Rugby Football Club</a> (SURFC) is a <a>Rugby union</a> club based at The University of Stirling.</p>
<h3>The Highland and Western Isles campuses</h3>
<p>As well as the main campus in Stirling, the University also has campuses in <a>Inverness</a> and <a>Stornoway</a> which specialise in Nursing and Midwifery. The Highland site is on the outskirts of Inverness and within the grounds of <a>Raigmore Hospital</a>. The site has purpose-built teaching facilities and student accommodation, recently benefiting from its relocation to the new Centre for Health Science, officially opened in January 2007. The Highland Health Sciences Library is also on this campus, and caters for both the students and staff of the University as well as the employees of <a>NHS Highland</a> and its associated Trusts.</p>
<p>The Western Isles campus is located in Stornoway and the teaching accommodation is an integral part of the recently built <a>Western Isles Hospital</a>. This is a small campus site which also has student accommodation within the environs of the Western Isles Hospital.</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>Since its inception, Stirling has offered modular degree programmes allowing greater flexibility and choice. Stirling was the first <a>United Kingdom</a> university to introduce the system of two semesters rather than having three terms. The first <a>semester</a> lasts from mid-September to mid-December and the second from mid-February to the end of May. </p>
<p>There are now over 256 courses (including combination courses) at the <a>undergraduate degree</a> level. A wide variety of courses are also available at the <a>postgraduate</a> level. </p>
<p>Excellent teaching ratings for <a>politics</a>, <a>accounting</a>, <a>finance</a>, <a>economics</a>, <a>sociology</a>, <a>religious studies</a>, <a>business studies</a>, <a>psychology</a> and <a>English language</a> demonstrate Stirling's expertise in the arts and <a>social science</a>s. Among the natural sciences, <a>environmental science</a> also achieved high ratings, its success reflected in the recently completed School of Biological and Environmental Sciences, with substantially refurbished facilities for both teaching and research. All but one of the subjects assessed for teaching quality were rated at least &quot;highly satisfactory&quot; and was ranked in the top ten in the UK for Teaching Assessment by <em><a>The Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em>. The <a>Philosophical Gourmet</a> report ranks Stirlings' joint graduate philosophy programme with the <a>University of St Andrews</a> as second in the UK and joint 13th in the English-Speaking world.</p>
<p>Despite a fall in graduate recruitment in recent years, the percentage of Stirling graduates in employment six months after graduation continues to rise. </p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p> Among Stirling University's specialist research centres are: the Cancer Care Research Centre; Scottish Network for Economic Methodology; Institute of Aquaculture; Centre for European Neighbourhood Studies; Centre for Environmental History and Policy; Stirling Media Research Institute; Social Work Research Centre; Centre for Social Research on Dementia; Scottish <a>Addiction</a> Studies; Scottish Network for Chronic Pain Research Centre; Scottish Centre for Information on <a>Language</a>, Teaching and Research; Centre for Lifelong Learning; and <a>Institute for Retail Studies</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE), 10 per cent of Stirling research was judged to be 'world leading' and a further three quarters as 'internationally excellent' and 'internationally recognised'. The University was rated first in Scotland for Nursing and Midwifery; Education; Sports Studies; Communication, Cultural and Media Studies.</p>
<h2>Governance and administration</h2>
<p>Unlike the <a>Ancient universities of Scotland</a>, Stirling University's constitution is laid out in its Royal Charter, rather than the <a>Universities (Scotland) Acts</a>. The administrative structure is however broadly similar, with the <a>University Court</a> (governing and financial body) and the <a>Academic Council</a> (academic affairs) based upon the ancient model. The University's constitution, academic regulations, and appointments are comprehensively outlined in the University calendar.. In 2009 the University reviewed its Charter and Statutes to amend the procedures for discipline of academic staff.</p>
<h3>University Court</h3>
<p>The governing body of the University is the <a>University Court</a>. It has overall responsibility for the management of the University&#x2019;s resources, the ongoing strategic direction of the University and the approval of major developments. It also receives regular reports from Executive Officers on the day to day operation of the University's business. The Court meets four times over the course of the academic year.</p>
<h3>Academic Council</h3>
<p><a>Academic Council</a> is the body which is responsible for the management of academic affairs, awarding of all degrees, and for the regulation and superintendence of the education, discipline and welfare of the students of the University. While the Court has the final responsibility for governing the University, on academic matters it will normally only act on the recommendation of Academic Council. The Council consists of various academics and is chaired by the Principal of the university. It has little real authority.</p>
<h3>Committees and Executive Officers</h3>
<p>There are also a number of committees supporting both the Court and Academic Council, that make important decisions and investigate matters referred to them. Day to day management of the University is undertaken by the <a>University Principal</a> (who is also <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>). The role of Chancellor itself is largely honorific, the current Chancellor is <a>Dr James Naughtie</a>. The current principal is <a>Professor Gerry McCormac</a> and the current chairman of court is a local businessman Alan Simpson.</p>
<p>There are also several Deputy Principals, each with a specific remit. They play a major role in the day to day management of the university. There is also a University Secretary.</p>
<h2>Student representation</h2>
<p>The <a>student</a>s of the University are represented by University of Stirling Students' Union (U.S.S.U.) which was named &quot;Best <a>Students' Union</a> in Scotland&quot; by the Bar Entertainment and Dance Association in 2003. It is based on-campus in the Robbins Centre Students' Union. It is primarily responsible for providing entertainment, welfare and information services to students and also, through the <a>USSU Council and Executive</a>, representing students interests to organisations including the University itself, which includes senior members being entitled to seats on the <a>University Court</a>. On its premises in the Robbins Centre it runs two bars: <em>Studio</em> and <em>Long-Bar</em>. USSU is also affiliated to an eclectic body of clubs and societies, ranging from the <a>Philhellenic</a> Society to the <a>Labour Students</a> Society. The Sports Union also supports some 40 sports clubs ranging from <a>athletics</a> to <a>waterpolo</a> via <a>Octopush</a> and <a>Fencing</a>. There are also a number of clubs within the University that are not affiliated to USSU, such as the Debating Union and <a>Tayforth Officers Training Corps</a>.</p>
<p>Stirling University also has student-run media services. <em>Brig</em> has been the campus newspaper since 1969. <em>Air3 1350</em>, was the first campus radio station in Scotland and <em>AirTV</em> (formerly Videoworks) is a television station for students, set up in 2002.</p>
