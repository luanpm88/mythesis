<p><strong>Youngstown State University</strong>, founded in 1908, is an urban research <a>university</a> located in <a>Youngstown</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, <a>United States</a>.  As of fall 2010, there were 15,194 students and a student-faculty ratio of 19:1. The fall 2010 enrollment figure is the highest since 1990, when the number of students on campus was 15,454. Records show that 11,803 of the students are undergraduates.  Beyond its current student body, YSU claims more than 84,000 alumni.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university's origins trace back to 1908, when the local branch of the <a>YMCA</a> established a school of law within the Youngstown Association School. In 1921, the school became known as the <strong>Youngstown Institute of Technology</strong> and offered its first evening courses.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>YSU lies on a  campus just north of <a>downtown Youngstown</a>.  Although it is not located near any outstanding geographical features, that has not stopped Youngstown State's campus from being noted for its landscaping, which is dissimilar from that of many other urban universities.  YSU's geographical center has a park-like atmosphere, featuring a rather-hilly terrain and a variety of trees and plant life, as well as tables and chairs that surround a campus fountain.</p>
<p>Most buildings on campus have been built within the last half-century, making them newer than most buildings in downtown Youngstown, where most buildings were constructed before the <a>Great Depression</a>.</p>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230 px|Jones Hall</a> Jones Hall, often the building that welcomes people coming onto the YSU campus, is also one of the campus's oldest buildings, having been built in 1931, when YSU was known as Youngstown College.  Its history as the &quot;main building&quot; of the campus continues today, as it is perhaps the best-known and most photographed building of the whole campus.  The building was renamed Jones Hall in honor of the institutions first president, Dr. Howard Jones.  Today, the building is used as mainly administrative office space.</p>
<p>The Rayen College of Engineering and Technology is housed in Moser Hall, completed in 1967. The university's geological and environmental sciences department shares the space, and also sponsor the Clarence R. Smith Mineral Museum.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|175 px| Andrews Wellness and Recreation Center</a> The newest addition to YSU is the <strong>Andrews Wellness and Recreation Center</strong>.  Completed in time for the fall 2005 semester, the Andrews Center gave YSU a complete gym facility, as well as a climbing wall and racquetball courts.</p>
<p><strong>Bliss Hall</strong>, completed in 1977 and featuring two auditoriums, is the home of the College of Fine and Performing Arts, including the Departments of Art, Communication (including communication studies and telecommunication studies), Theater &amp; Dance, and the <a>Dana School of Music</a>. Next door to Bliss Hall is the <a>McDonough Museum of Art</a>, YSU's University Art Museum and the Mahoning Valley's center for contemporary art.  The Museum has regular changing exhibitions by regional, national and international artists and provides public access to the work of students, faculty and alumni from the Department of Art.</p>
<p><strong>Beeghly Hall</strong> was completed in 1998 at a cost of $14 million. The Beeghly College of Education resides there, and it also hosts several programs open to the community, such as the Community Counseling Center.  Beeghly, which is located away from the campus proper, is planned to be linked to the rest of the campus through a main pedestrian pathway, a plan that ran into trouble. [[Image:YSUArbys.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Arby's]] location inside Kilcawley Center. Arby's originated in nearby <a>Boardman</a> in 1964 and maintains a major presence in the Mahoning Valley.]] Kilcawley Center is primarily a resource and community center on campus. It features reading and study rooms, computer labs, a copying center, YSU's bookstore, a variety of restaurants (including a full-service <a>Arby's</a> and a <a>KFC Express</a>), and many student-affairs offices. There are also many meeting and seminar rooms, which can be rented out for events by the community.</p>
<p>YSU has six housing facilities. <strong>Lyden House</strong>, completed in 1990, and <strong>Cafaro House</strong> residential honors facility, completed in 1995, can accommodate a combined 574 students.  <strong>Christman Dining Commons</strong>, YSU's main residential dining hall, is located in the Anne K. Christman Campus Green between these buildings.  <strong>Kilcawley House</strong> is attached to <strong>Kilcawley Center</strong> in the middle of campus. <strong>Wick House</strong> and <strong>Weller House</strong>, off Wick Avenue, also houses a small number of students in an apartment setting.  The University Courtyard Apartments, on the east side of the campus (behind <strong>Bliss Hall</strong>), were built in 2004.  These are commonly known as <strong>the Courtyards</strong>.  They are actual apartments and are not affiliated with housing services at YSU, instead they are managed by an outside company, Ambling Leasing.  <strong>Buechner Hall</strong> is an independently owned and operated women's residence hall located on Bryson Street and operated by the Beuchner Foundation. The <strong>Flats at Wick</strong>, also a privately owned and operated apartments were built and opened in Fall of 2010 on the corner of Madison Ave and Elm Street.  </p>

<h2>Ward Beecher Planetarium</h2>
<p>The university's planetarium, located in <strong>Ward Beecher Hall</strong>, opened in 1967 and was recently renovated. The $750,000 upgrade included new seats (145), a SciDome fulldome video projector from Spitz, Inc., as well as a Chronos star projector from GOTO. The star projector, which replicates the night sky onto the planetarium's  diameter dome, cost $489,000.</p>
<p>The planetarium is the location of the introductory astronomy courses at YSU, which registers almost 1,000 students every year. It has housed over 500,000 students, as well as 750,000 visitors as of 2007. Organized shows are available for groups during the week, and scheduled shows available Friday and Saturday evenings (with a show geared toward a younger crowd Saturday afternoons). All shows are free of charge. For schedule, go to www.wbplanetarium.org.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The University comprises the following colleges as of the Summer 2007 academic reorganization:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>The College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (a.k.a. CLASS)</a></li>
  <li><a>The Beeghly College of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>The College of Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (a.k.a. STEM)</a></li>
  <li><a>The College of Fine and Performing Arts</a></li>
  <li><a>The Bitonte College of Health and Human Services</a></li>
  <li><a>The Williamson College of Business Administration</a></li>
  <li><a>The School of Graduate Studies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>YSU offers doctoral degrees in educational leadership and physical therapy, as well as a doctorate in mathematics in cooperation with <a>Rhodes University</a>.  Together with the <a>University of Akron</a> and <a>Kent State University</a>, YSU sponsors the <a>Northeastern Ohio Universities College Of Medicine (NEOUCOM)</a>, a BS-MD program. YSU engineering students may pursue <a>doctoral</a> studies in cooperation with the University of Akron and <a>Cleveland State University</a>. In addition, YSU has 35 masters programs and over 100 undergraduate majors.</p>
<p><strong>The Dana School of Music</strong> at Youngstown State University was deemed an &quot;All-<a>Steinway</a>&quot; school in 2004. The Dana School of Music is one of the oldest non-conservatory schools of music in the United States. It is housed in <strong>Bliss Hall</strong>.  Additionally, the Youngstown State University Symphonic Wind Ensemble performed in March 2005 at New York City's <a>Carnegie Hall</a>.  The ensemble's performance was highly praised, and they received a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Youngstown State University is also home to the Center for Working Class Studies and offers a Regional and <a>American Studies</a> program, which was the first of its kind in the United States.  The school assisted the <a>University of Chicago</a> in developing a similar program.  The center is operated by John Russo and Sherry Lee Linkon.</p>
<p>YSU is also known as the one of the few universities to have <a>college professors</a>, rather than <a>graduate assistants</a>, directly teach undergraduate students, as it is more common at large universities to use graduate assistants. This is because YSU has few doctoral programs and a relatively high standard teaching load (four courses per semester). In most colleges, graduate assistants teach courses to undergraduate students. while full-time professors focus on graduate courses, limiting their direct involvement in undergraduate education to lecturing in large sections of introductory courses and supervising graduate assistants, and by grading exams (especially <a>final exams</a>) and <a>term paper</a>s if those classes necessitate it.</p>
<h2>Departments</h2>
<p>YSU has Departments that cover most of the topics one would expect to see at a university of its type.  Some cover single academic disciplines/programs while others serve as administrative units to consolidate several related disciplines and programs. Some of the larger Departments have over a dozen full-time faculty and support both undergraduate and graduate degrees while others are much smaller and only participate in undergraduate programs.  The emphasis of the faculty and staff in these departments is on the accomplishment of their mission areas of teaching, service, and scholarly activity.  Each of the Departments offers strong educational opportunities and most offer many research and service activities to their students.  Such contributions have been growing rapidly such that many of the departments, (e.g., English, Chemistry, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) are at or near the top of national rankings for departments of their type. This has resulted in the growth in external funding to YSU from organizations such as the National Science Foundation that has increased consistently at a double digit rate for the last decade and a half(amongst the strongest growth trajectory in the country)and total external funding to support these student-centered companies now exceeds twelve million dollars annually.</p>

<h2>Labor relations</h2>
<p>Labor Unions are very active at YSU and include most non-administrative faculty and staff on campus.  During the first decade of the 21st century, they went through a very intense period and in the mid-part of this decade were increasingly strained. In August 2005, just before the start of the 2005&#x2013;06 academic year, two of four campus unions were on strike. Following the conclusion of the strike, relations have remained strained, with some faculty and staff calling for resignation of YSU President David Sweet in May 2007. Others on campus through some individuals on both sides were engaged in less than optimum behaviors.  Due to the intensity of the disagreements, the following academic year a special committee was set up to examine labor relations.  This committee  recommended that the bargaining units for all sides be replaced before the next contract.  Subsequent to these recommendations the Vice President for Administration was replaced as well as the Executive Director of Human Resources.</p>
<p>Relations have improved since this time and are now typical of what one would expect of a unionized campus in a region that has always been at the center of US union activism.</p>
