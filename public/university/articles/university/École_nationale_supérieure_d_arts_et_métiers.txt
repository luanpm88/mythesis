<p> The <strong>&#x00c9;cole Nationale Sup&#x00e9;rieure d'Arts et M&#x00e9;tiers</strong> or <strong>ENSAM</strong> is a French Engineering institute and <em><a>grand &#x00e9;tablissement</a></em> and a founding member of <a>ParisTech</a> (Paris Institute of Technology). </p>
<p>The major fields of study at the ENSAM are:  </p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Mechanical engineering</a></li>
  <li><a>Industrial and manufacturing engineering</a></li>
  <li><a>Systems engineering</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most students complete <a>preparatory classes</a> as well as placement tests in order to attend such schools, called <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em> in France; thus, the freshman year at ENSAM is the equivalent to the third year of university. In most cases, students spend the two first years in one of the many campuses: <a>Aix-en-Provence</a>, <a>Angers</a>, <a>Bordeaux</a>, <a>Ch&#x00e2;lons-en-Champagne</a>, <a>Cluny</a>, <a>Lille</a>, or <a>Metz</a>. The <a>Paris</a> campus is reserved for third year-students. As all the other <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em>, ENSAM graduates finish with the American equivalent of bachelor of science degree &amp; master's degree. Each year, approximately 1,000 students receive a master's degree [2nd cycle, in french] called the <em>dipl&#x00f4;me d'ing&#x00e9;nieur de l'&#x00c9;cole Nationale Sup&#x00e9;rieure d'Arts et M&#x00e9;tiers</em>, and 50 students  receive a doctoral degree [3rd cycle in French].</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded in <a>Liancourt</a>, <a>Oise</a>, under its' creator <a>Duke of Rochefoucauld-Liancourt</a> in 1780; it was originally meant to provide in-depth training for military <a>dragoon</a> officers. After 1800, the institution became known as the <em>&#x00c9;cole d'Arts et M&#x00e9;tiers</em>. </p>
<p>Under <a>Napoleon's</a> reign it was known as the &quot;Ecole Imperiale des Arts et Metiers&quot;.</p>
<p>The second school of this kind was founded in 1804 at <a>Beaupr&#x00e9;au</a> (near <a>Angers</a>), but was actually in use after a third one was already functional in Ch&#x00e2;lons-en-Champagne. The latest campus established was Metz (1997).</p>
<p>The regional campuses were transformed into engineer training institutions in 1907.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the students perpetuate their own <em><a>traditions</a></em> and <a>folklore</a>, and are members of a <a>student society</a>. They call themselves &quot;<em><a>Gadz'Arts</a></em>&quot;, abbreviated from &quot;<em>Gars des Arts</em>&quot; (&quot;Guys from the Arts&quot;). The &quot;Gadz&quot; folklore includes traditional clothing, language, songs and legends, related symbolism, and <a>ceremonial</a>s. <em>Gadz'Arts</em> activities are independent of the administration of the school and are exclusively run by the students, although the two parts often cooperate for organising cultural or sporting events.</p>
