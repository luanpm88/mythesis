<ul>
  <li>At home football games, large signs and banners representing campus fraternities, sororities, and student organizations adorn the grassy hills that surround Homer Bryce Stadium.</li>
  <li>The annual Parents Day is now in its 32nd year. This is one of the largest student run programs on the campus of SFA. Parents, friends and family members of students visit the campus every fall for a day of activities and school spirit. Parents Day is sponsored by the Residence Hall Association in conjunction with the Housing and Residence Life Departments.</li>
  <li>The University's main rivals are <a>Sam Houston State University</a> and <a>Northwestern State University</a>.</li>
  <li>The Stephen F. Austin State and Sam Houston State rivalry matchup is called the <a>Battle of the Piney Woods</a>. In 2010, the two universities agreed to move the annual football matchups to <a>Houston, Texas</a> in <a>Reliant Stadium</a>. Stephen F. Austin defeated Sam Houston, making them 1-0 in the Reliant Stadium Series.</li>
  <li>In 1960, a seven-foot, six-inch statue of an Indian named &quot;Chief <a>Caddo</a>&quot; was carved as a trophy between SFA and Northwestern State University (both schools are located in towns named for a branch of the Caddo tribe).  The winner of the football game between these two schools maintains possession of the statue. <a>Chief Caddo</a> is the largest <a>trophy</a> in college football. SFA is currently in possession of Chief Caddo, after defeating Northwestern State in November 2010. SFA has been in possession of Chief Caddo since winning him in 2009.</li>
  <li>Every year at Homecoming a bonfire is lit by members of the organization that has the most points earned in a series of competitions leading up to the the Homecoming celebration.  Preceding the lighting of the bonfire, a &quot;Torchlight Parade&quot; is held, where students walk through campus with lights to the Homecoming Pep Rally.</li>
  <li>The Student Activities Association distributes Homecoming Shirts by allowing students to trade in other university-affiliated garments. Participants get new SFA shirts, are the used trade-ins are burned on the Homecoming bonfire.</li>
  <li>The Sawyers were created in 1927 as the first men's social organization. In November 1960, the Sawyers adapted Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. They were the first group to have a reserved section in the stands at football games, which was requested by Homer Bryce, for whom the stadium is named. The Sawyers began the tradition of bringing axe handles to the football games and using them as noise makers/spirit sticks. The Purple Haze Inc. revived the idea and tradition of the axe handle in 2002.</li>
  <li>Purple Haze: The student fan section. The Purple Haze Section is 1 of 2 university clubs that has a section reserved (The Delta Sig Sawyers are the other). The bleachers have been painted and stenciled for the group by the Athletic Department of SFA.</li>
  <li>Many SFA students decorate axe handles to take to the football games.</li>
  <li>When the football team wins a home game, the purple beacons located on top of Steen Hall are turned on to light up the night</li>
  <li>The &quot;Axe 'Em Jacks&quot; slogan has existed since the creation of the Lumberjacks mascot. But the now-popular hand signal utilized by SFA fans developed during Spring Break 1978 on South Padre Island, when a group of Alpha Chi Omega sorority girls noticed that other Texas colleges has hand signals specific to their schools (&quot;Hook 'Em Horns&quot; for the University of Texas, for instance.) As a response, freshman student 'Marcia' suggested the two-fingered salute to a male cheerleader ('Monty') who later spread the hand gesture to fans once games resumed.</li>
  <li>The Student Government Association host its annual Watermelon Bash each summer. Watermelons are iced in the fountain around the statue of Stephen F. Austin in the center of campus, and the university president, deans and other administrators help distribute watermelons slices to students and other members of the campus community.</li>
  <li>It is considered &quot;bad luck&quot; for an undergraduate student to walk through the Old Stone Fort. Rumor has it that if a student does, he/she will not graduate. This rumor, however, has been proven false.</li>
  <li>At home baseball games, the students in the outfield throw back opposing teams' home runs.</li>
