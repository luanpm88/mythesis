<h2>Study abroad opportunities</h2>
<p>Washington Adventist University co-sponsors Adventist Colleges Abroad, a program in which qualified students study overseas while completing requirements for graduation at Washington Adventist University.  This language and cultural immersion is available in eight locations: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain,  WAU undergraduate students may also study business courses in England through an exclusive partnership program with Newbold College just outside of London, England.</p>
<h2>WGTS controversy</h2>
<p>WAU nearly accepted a $25 million bid for the radio station owned by WAU, WGTS 91.9FM, from American Public Media Group in 2007. The Board of Trustees voted against selling the radio station in September of 2007. </p>
<p>WGTS listeners and supporters ran multiple campaigns against the sale for months before the final decision was made by the board.</p>
<p>WAU would have used the sale payment to pay down about $5 million in debts and to increase its endowment of $4 million. The school, which has an enrollment of about 1,000 students, also anticipated that the proceeds would pay for constructing the first new building on campus in 37 years.</p>
<h2>Restructuring in 2008</h2>
<p>In 2008, President Weymouth Spence announced he would eliminate or freeze up to 22 faculty and staff positions in order to restructure the school&#x2019;s curriculum and relieve WAU's multimillion-dollar debt.</p>
<p>The announcement came as part of Spence's plan to restructure WAU into a health science-focused institution.</p>
<p>As a result, some students and faculty expressed uncertainty and displeasure regarding the change in school focus to local and school-wide media. </p>
