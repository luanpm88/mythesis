<p>  <strong>Birmingham City University</strong> (abbrev. as <strong>BCU</strong>; and previously <strong>Birmingham Polytechnic</strong> and the <strong>University of Central England in Birmingham</strong>) is a <a>British university</a> in the city of <a>Birmingham</a>, <a>England</a>. It is the second largest of three universities in the city, the other two being the <a>Aston University</a> and <a>University of Birmingham</a>. Established in 1971, it was designated as a <a>polytechnic</a> until 1992, when it gained university status.</p>
<p>The university has eight campuses serving six faculties, and offers courses in <a>art and design</a>, <a>business</a>, the <a>built environment</a>, <a>computing</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>healthcare</a>, <a>law</a>, the <a>performing arts</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, and <a>technology</a>. A <a>proposed &#x00a3;150m campus</a> in the city centre of Birmingham, part of the <a>Eastside development</a> of a new technology and learning quarter, is to open in 2013. The university is a designated <a>Skillset</a> Media Academy, a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning for health and social care, and a member of the <a>million+</a> group of <a>New Universities</a>.</p>
<p>Birmingham City University is the <a>West Midlands</a>' largest provider of <a>higher education</a> for undergraduate study, and its portfolio of part-time courses is among the biggest in the UK. Roughly half of the university's full-time students are from the West Midlands, and a large percentage of these are from ethnic minorities. The university runs access and foundation programmes through an international network of associated universities and further education colleges, and has the highest intake of international students in the Birmingham area.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it became a <a>university</a> in 1992, it was a <a>polytechnic</a>. The City of Birmingham Polytechnic, run by <a>Birmingham City Council</a>, was the second polytechnic in Birmingham, the first&mdash;<a>Birmingham Polytechnic Institution</a>&mdash;having existed in the mid-19th century for ten years.</p>
<h3>Birmingham Polytechnic</h3>
<p>In the 1960s, changes were made to the higher education system creating an expansion of polytechnics as a more vocationally orientated alternative to the typical university.</p>
<p>The City of Birmingham Education Committee was invited to submit a scheme for the establishment of a polytechnic bringing together a number of different colleges in the city in 1967. Late in 1969, the post of director of the polytechnic was advertised. Although the city lagged behind other parts of the country, Birmingham finally gained a polytechnic in 1971&mdash;then the 27th in the UK&mdash;designated by the Education Secretary <a>Margaret Thatcher</a> as the <strong>City of Birmingham Polytechnic</strong>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Early Birmingham Polytechnic prospectuses showing the original logo</a> It was formed initially out of five colleges. Some of the colleges' staff fought against the merger but later changed their minds. The colleges were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Birmingham College of Art and Design</a> (originally the <a>Birmingham Government School of Design</a>, founded in October 1843);</li>
  <li><a>Birmingham School of Music</a> (developed as a department of the <a>Birmingham and Midland Institute</a> around 1859);</li>
  <li><a>Birmingham College of Commerce</a> (established in the early 20th century as a branch school of the Birmingham Central Technical College, which went on to become <a>Aston University</a>);</li>
  <li><a>South Birmingham Technical College</a> (opened in 1961);</li>
  <li><a>North Birmingham Technical College</a> (formerly Aston Technical College, opened in 1966).</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter's new Perry Barr campus (which began construction in 1971) became the centre of the new Polytechnic, although the institution continued to have a number of different campuses spread across the city. This has sometimes been seen as a weakness of the polytechnic, with the dispersal of sites considered confusing to visitors.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Site of Perry Barr (later City North) campus before building began in the early 1970s</a> In the early 1970s, the Perry Barr campus was the site of building work for what later became the centrepiece of the polytechnic: the Attwood and Baker buildings. Later in the 1970s, the campus was increased in size with the building of what later became the Cox, Dawson, Edge, Feeney and Galton buildings. In the early 1980s, the William Kenrick Library was added to the site. Although smaller buildings were subsequently constructed, this is largely the Perry Barr campus as it remains today (now called the City North Campus of Birmingham City University).</p>
<p>From its opening, the polytechnic was considered very strong in the field of <a>art and design</a>. As early as 1972, fashion and textile courses were heavily oversubscribed; there were 100 applications for every 30 places. Arts courses remained strong at the polytechnic through the 1970s, with twice as many arts students compared to those doing engineering or technology courses.</p>
<p>In 1975, three more colleges were added to the polytechnic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Anstey College of Physical Education</a> (founded as a private college for women in 1897);</li>
  <li><a>Bordesley College of Education</a> (founded as a <a>Local Education Authority</a> (LEA) Day Training College for women teachers in 1963);</li>
  <li><a>City of Birmingham College of Education</a> (founded as an LEA Emergency Teacher Training College in 1948).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the mid 1970s, the polytechnic's then-chairman, William Kenrick, sparked criticism from politicians for saying his students were &quot;second-class&quot; students. In 1978, a lecturer in law, Francis Reynolds, was convicted and fined &#x00a3;150 for preparing instruments of property conveyance without being a solicitor. He did this to challenge the monopoly solicitors held over conveyancing, which he felt led to higher costs.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Logo after the late 1980s</a> In 1988, the <a>Birmingham Institute of Art and Design</a> (BIAD) was established from the merging of the polytechnic's Faculty of Art and Design with <a>Bournville College of Art</a>. The extensive archives from these earlier incarnations, including over 10,000 artworks, were housed at the polytechnic's <a>Margaret Street</a> campus.</p>
<p>Following the UK Government's <a>Education Reform Act</a> in 1989, the polytechnic ceased to be under Birmingham Local Education Authority control and became an independent <a>corporation</a> with <a>charitable status</a>. It was funded by the <a>Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council</a> and no longer by the local education authority. The polytechnic continued to have close links to <a>Birmingham City Council</a>, and to this day the <a>Lord Mayor of Birmingham</a> also serves as the University's Chancellor.</p>
<p>The change in status enabled a tighter union between the polytechnic and industry, and by 1989 it had 30 lecturer's posts sponsored by firms.</p>
<h3>University status</h3>
<p>The <a>Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a> allowed all <a>polytechnics</a> to adopt the title of &quot;university&quot;. The name <em>University of Central England in Birmingham</em> was approved by the <a>Privy Council</a> on 16 June 1992. The name change took place in time for the new academic year starting later that year. Students who graduated in mid 1992 were given certificates bearing the name <em>University of Central England</em>, even if the entirety of their study had taken place at the polytechnic.</p>
<p>[[Image:vittoria st.jpg|thumb|right|Inside view of Vittoria Street, [[Birmingham School of Jewellery|School of Jewellery]], which reopened in 1995]] In 1995, two more colleges were absorbed&#x2014;Birmingham and Solihull College of Nursing and Midwifery, and the West Midlands School of Radiography&#x2014;and the <a>Birmingham School of Jewellery</a> opened on Vittoria Street in Birmingham's <a>Jewellery Quarter</a>. The Faculty of Engineering and Computer Technology provided the basis for the creation of the <a>Technology Innovation Centre</a> (TIC) in 2000. The following year, the Faculty of Health incorporated the Defence School of Health Care Studies.</p>
<p>In 2003, the university declined a merger proposal from the <a>University of Birmingham</a>. that, according to <em><a>The Guardian</a></em>, &quot;would create an institution of 32,000 students with a &#x00a3;200m turnover&quot;. The plans were announced by the then Vice-Chancellor Peter Knight, and approved by lecturers. The new institution would utilise the established Aston University name, and all UCE staff members' jobs and employment conditions would be kept intact, although Vice-Chancellor Knight would not be part of its management team. He estimated a completion date for the merger of August 2006.</p>
<p>The Aston University Council discussed the proposal during a meeting on 3 December 2003 and concluded that it should be rejected. In a statement, the university said that &quot;Whilst the Council respects UCE's distinctive mission, it does not share UCE's analysis of the potential opportunities that might arise from any merger&quot;, and cited influencing factors such as Aston's approach to research and teaching, the &quot;significant differences between the missions and strategies&quot; of Aston and UCE, and the negative impact that prolonged discussions would have on both institutions. Aston suggested that it, UCE and the University of Birmingham should instead begin discussions about the three universities' contribution to the future of local and regional higher education. with three possible names being proposed: <em>Birmingham City University</em>, <em>Birmingham Chamberlain University</em>, and <em>Birmingham Metropolitan University</em>. Staff and students (both current and alumni) were asked to complete a survey on what they wished the name to be changed to. On October 1, 2007, Vice-Chancellor David Tidmarsh unveiled the name change from UCE Birmingham to <em>Birmingham City University</em>. 48.2% of those who voted on the survey voted for this name, although 62.1% of staff had voted for <em>Birmingham Metropolitan University</em>. The University of Birmingham Council had previously advised UCE that their preferred choice was <em>Birmingham Metropolitan University</em>, and that it considered <em>Birmingham Chamberlain University</em> &quot;unacceptable&quot; because of <a>Joseph Chamberlain</a>'s historic involvement and association with the University of Birmingham. A common argument was that money should be spend on facilities and building repair work, and some students felt ignored by the establishment. The rationale for the name change was a perceived confusion of the location of the university and to give a &quot;shorter, more powerful name&quot;. The rebranding of the university, which included changing signage and stationery, cost &#x00a3;285,084.</p>
<p>The university's current logo, designed by Birmingham-based BHMG Marketing, The crest itself originated from the Birmingham College of Commerce, one of the institutions that formed the polytechnic in 1971. In 2009, the logo was revised to include the word &quot;CITY&quot; in upper-case on the first line instead of in lower-case on the second.</p>
<p>The university is planning a <a>new &quot;flagship&quot; campus in Birmingham City Centre</a>, next to the existing facilities at Millennium Point. The City Centre campus will be a &#x00a3;123 to &#x00a3;150 million development as part of Birmingham's <a>Eastside</a> development, and will include 35,000 and 45,000 square metres of accommodation and be the new home for media, arts and engineering learning. Existing facilities at the Gosta Green and Bournville Campuses will be moved to the new facilities as the university seeks to reduce the number of campuses it occupies. However, with the introduction of the high-speed rail line plans in March 2010, these plans have been put on hold.</p>

</ul>
<p>[[File:Millennium Point -front -Birmingham -UK.JPG|thumb|right|The planned [[Birmingham City University City Centre Campus|City Centre Campus]] is to be developed next to the <a>Millennium Point</a> complex.]] The university is planning a <a>new &quot;flagship&quot; campus in Birmingham City Centre</a>, next to the existing facilities at Millennium Point. The City Centre campus will be a &#x00a3;150 million development as part of Birmingham's <a>Eastside</a> development, and will include 35,000 and 45,000 square metres of accommodation and be the new home for media, arts and engineering learning. The <a>International Project Space</a> (IPS) is an art gallery located at the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts.</p>
<p>Moor Lane is a venue for sports, business training and conferences near to City North Campus. Previously, a dedicated sports centre was located behind The Coppice, a student accommodation block next to the City North Campus, and included tennis courts, bowls, football and rugby pitches, running track and a social club. The university announced a &#x00a3;7 million sports complex would be built on the site, formerly the Ansells Sports Club, with construction to start in mid 2008 for completion in 2009. The centre, City North Sports Centre, opened on 4 January 2010 and includes a fitness suite, workout classes, and a sports hall.</p>
<p>Lawyers at Wragge &amp; Co have advised Birmingham City University on the outsourcing of work for the sports centre to international service company Serco. Under a new 10-year agreement, the FTSE 100 company will run both the sports centre and the existing Pavilion sports facility in Perry Barr.</p>

<h3>Faculties and schools</h3>
<p>Birmingham City University is a large university and has departments covering a wide range of subjects. The university's system was re-organised into six faculties in September 2008 and are composed of numerous schools and departments.</p>
<p><a>Birmingham Institute of Art and Design</a> (BIAD) is one of the largest faculties of art and design education in the United Kingdom. BIAD provides education for nearly 4,000 students on five major campuses located in the centre and to the north and south of the centre of Birmingham. It was previously home to the Department of Media and Communication until 2008. BIAD comprises five schools: the <a>School of Art</a>, <a>School of Jewellery</a>, the School of Architecture, the School of Fashion, the School of Textiles and Three-Dimensional Design, and the School of Visual Communication.</p>
<p>The university's business faculty, <a>Birmingham City Business School</a>, is a major centre for business, computing and management education. With over 4,000 students studying on full and part-time courses, it is one of the largest business schools in the UK. It incorporates three academic departments and two specialist centres: the Department of Accountancy and Finance, the Department of Business and Marketing, the Department of Management and Human Resources, the Centre for Leadership and Management Practice, and the Centre for Internal Audit, Governance and Risk Management.</p>
<p>The <a>Faculty of Education, Law and Social Sciences</a> (ELSS) includes elements of the former faculties of Education and of Law, Humanities, Development and Society (LHDS), which offered courses in law, social studies, English (literature, language and cultural studies) and property, construction and planning (it closed in 2008). ELSS has four schools: the School of Law, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Primary and Early Years, and the School of Secondary and Post-Compulsory Education and Training. The latter two provide courses for intending teachers, serving teachers or those simply interested in education issues covering the entire range of school phases from infant to continuing education, at every study level from full-time undergraduate to postgraduate level and PhD.</p>
<p>The <a>Faculty of Health</a> is the university's <a>NHS</a>-supported healthcare training faculty. It is one of BCU's largest faculties, with nearly 7,000 full and part-time students studying each year, and is among the UK's largest higher education centres for health and social care. The faculty includes the Defence School of Health Care, which is part of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM).</p>
<p>[[File:Birmingham Conservatoire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birmingham Conservatoire]], pictured in 2006 with <em>UCE Birmingham</em> signage]] The <a>Faculty of Performance, Media and English</a> (PME) is the university's newest faculty (introduced in September 2008) and includes four divisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Birmingham Conservatoire</a>, an international <a>conservatoire</a> and junior school and a major concert venue for many of Birmingham&#x2019;s principal concert promoters and organisations, hosting over 300 events annually;</li>
  <li><a>Birmingham School of Acting</a>, which merged with the university in 2005 following a period of collaboration;</li>
  <li><a>School of English</a>, home to the <a>National Academy of Writing</a>;</li>
  <li><a>Birmingham School of Media</a>, one of the first media schools in the country to teach media as part of the <a>Skillset</a> Academy Network. Its courses have received approval from the <a>Broadcast Journalism Training Council</a> and the <a>Chartered Institute of Public Relations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a>Faculty of Technology, Engineering and the Environment</a> (TEE), based in Millenium Point, is a national centre of excellence for learning, innovation and technology transfer. The faculty was temporarily known as the Faculty of Technology, Innovation and Development (TID) from 2008 until 2009, when the university relaunched the faculty through the merger of three of the more successful departments&mdash;the Technology Innovation Centre (TIC), School of Computing, and the School of Property Construction. It now has four divisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineering, Design and Manufacturing Systems (EDMS)</li>
  <li>Computing, Telecommunications and Networks (CTN)</li>
  <li>Digital Media Technology (DMT);</li>
  <li>Property Construction and Planning (PCP).</li>
</ul>
<p>Former faculties of the university include the Built Environment, which closed in 2005; course provision was moved to BIAD and the Faculty of Law, Humanities, Development and Society (LHDS), which closed in 2008. The Faculty of Computing Information Systems was also closed in 2005, and the computing courses were moved to the Business School.</p>
<h3>Libraries and collections</h3>
<p>[[Image:Kenrick library front.JPG|thumb|left|Steps up to front entrance of [[William Kenrick (MP)|William Kenrick]] library, City North Campus]] The university has seven libraries across Birmingham on all campuses that contain around 950,000 books and 9,000 print and electronic journals. Kenrick Library, named after the politician <a>William Kenrick</a>, is located at the City North Campus and is the largest of the university's libraries, covering three floors and featuring more than 320,000 books, 2,000 print journals and more than 4,000 electronic journals. A &#x00a3;3 million refurbishment introduced a suite of individual and group study areas. The other six libraries are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conservatoire Library;</li>
  <li>Bournville Library;</li>
  <li>Gosta Green Library;</li>
  <li><a>Mary Seacole</a> Library (located at the City South Campus);</li>
  <li>Margaret Street Library;</li>
  <li>Vittoria Street Library.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1998, the university was involved in controversy when a book by photographer <a>Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, <em>Mapplethorpe</em> (2002), was confiscated. A final year undergraduate student was writing a paper on Mapplethorpe's work and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs. She took the photographs to the local chemist to be developed and the chemist informed <a>West Midlands Police</a> because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.</p>
<p>The university Vice-Chancellor, Dr Peter Knight, took the view&mdash;supported by the Senate&mdash;that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of <a>academic freedom</a>. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the <a>Obscene Publications Act</a>, which defines obscenity as material that is likely to deprave and corrupt. The police focused on one particular image, 'Jim and Tom, Sausalito 1977', which depicts one man <a>urinating into the mouth of another</a>.</p>
<p>After the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the <a>Crown Prosecution Service</a> as the <a>Director of Public Prosecutions</a> (DPP) has to take the decision as to whether or not to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when the DPP informed Dr Knight that no action would be taken as &quot;there was insufficient evidence to support a successful prosecution on this occasion&quot;. The original book was returned, in a slightly tattered state, and restored to the university library.</p>
