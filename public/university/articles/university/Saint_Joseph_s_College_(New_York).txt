<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally named <strong>St. Joseph's College for Women</strong>, the college was founded by the <a>Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of <a>Brentwood</a>, in response to the need for a day college for young women.  The college received its provisional charter from the Regents of the University of the State of New York on February 24, 1916.  After the college outgrew its original facilities at 286 Washington Avenue, it moved to its present site at 245 Clinton Avenue in 1918. The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred on twelve graduates on June 17, 1920.  The College was accredited in 1928 by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.  The Regents granted St. Joseph's College an Absolute Charter in 1929. Reverend William T. Dillon, J.D., Professor of Philosophy, served as Dean of the College and later its President, during the years that followed. St. Joseph's opened a laboratory pre-school in 1934 following several years of research in the field of Child Development. Sister Vincent Th&#x00e9;r&#x00e8;se Tuohy assumed the presidency in 1956. McEntegart Hall, a multi-functional building housing the library and classrooms, was opened in 1965; the Dillon Child Study Center followed in 1968.</p>
<p>Sister George Aquin O'Connor was elected President and assumed responsibility on July 1, 1969.  In 1970, a Charter amendment changed the name to St. Joseph's College and enabled the college to admit the first male students to full matriculation.  On February 2, 1971, St. Joseph's inaugurated an extension program in the collegiate center formerly known as Brentwood College, and moved to develop a degree program in Brentwood, oriented to the third and fourth years of college. This Upper Division baccalaureate program opened in September 1972, and the Board of Regents of the State of New York authorized St. Joseph's College to join <a>Long Island University C.W. Post Campus</a>, in a Coordinate Campus program, the first such pattern adopted in the State. In 1976, this Suffolk County operation was authorized by the Regents to operate as a branch campus. In 1978, St. Joseph's College expanded its operation at the Suffolk Branch Campus to a full four-year program, and in 1979 moved to a twenty-five acre campus in Patchogue which includes a baseball field, two multi-story buildings that house classrooms, a multi-story research library, and a modern athletic facility that includes a convertable indoor sport floor, an indoor swimming pool, fully equipped weight rooms and several other offerings.</p>
