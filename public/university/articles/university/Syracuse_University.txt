<p> <strong>Syracuse University</strong> (also referred to as <strong>SU</strong>) is a private research university located in <a>Syracuse</a>, <a>New York</a>, <a>United States</a>. Its roots can be traced back to Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, founded by the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in 1832, which also later founded <a>Genesee College</a>. Following several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was founded independent of the college in 1870. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as <a>nonsectarian</a>, Syracuse was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1966.</p>
<p>The campus is located in the <a>University Hill</a> neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of <a>downtown</a>, on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century <a>Romanesque</a> structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally-recognized programs in <a>information studies and library science</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>communications</a>, <a>business administration</a>, <a>public administration</a>, and <a>engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the <a>Orange</a>, participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the <a>Big East Conference</a> for all <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> athletics, except for the women's <a>ice hockey</a>, and the <a>rowing crew</a>. SU is also a member of the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|400px|First Annual Class of Syracuse University.</a> The <a>Genesee Wesleyan Seminary</a> was founded in 1832 by the Genesee <a>Annual Conference</a> of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Lima, New York, south of <a>Rochester</a>. In 1850, it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming <a>Genesee College</a>. However, the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. The college began looking for a new home at the same time that Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince <a>Ezra Cornell</a> and <a>Andrew Dickson White</a> to locate <a>Cornell University</a> there rather than in <a>Ithaca</a>. and thereafter considered Syracuse a <a>Sodom and Gomorrah</a> insisting that the university be located in <a>Ithaca</a> on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and <a>Cayuga Lake</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse.  At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the <a>Morrill Land Grant Act</a> for Genesee College. Eventually, they agreed to a quid-pro quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support for his bill.  Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875. At its founding on March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the University its charter independent of Genesee College. and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees. Rev. Daniel Steele, a former Genesee College president, served as the first administrative leader of Syracuse until its Chancellor was appointed. The university opened in September 1871 in rented space downtown.</p>
<p>The unviersity was founded as coeducational, and President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, &quot;The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... &quot; Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. The ratio between male and female students during the 19th century  in the College of Liberal Arts was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and  a low ratio of women enrolled as students in the College of Medicine and the College of Law. and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. SU's school of journalism, now the <a>S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications</a>, was established at Syracuse in 1934.</p>
<p>The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor <a>James Day</a> and <a>John Archbold</a>. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years, he also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), the Archbold Gymnasium (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.</p>
<h3>Modern</h3>
<p>After World War II, Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the <a>G.I. Bill</a>, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from <a>MIT</a> and started the first <a>pathogen</a>-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.  Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, <a>Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.</a> donated $15&nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the <a>SI Newhouse School of Public Communications</a>. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, an <a>organization</a> of leading research <a>universities</a> devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic <a>research</a> and education.</p>

<h3>Pan Am flight 103</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|SU's Flight 103 Memorial</a>  On December 21, 1988, 35 Syracuse University students were among the fatalities in the terrorist bombing of <a>Pan Am Flight 103</a> over <a>Lockerbie</a>, <a>Scotland</a>. The students were returning from a study-abroad program in Europe. </p>
<p>That evening, Syracuse University went on with a <a>basketball</a> game just hours after the attack, for which it was severely criticized.</p>
<p>In April 1990, Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103, constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages. Every year the university holds &quot;Remembrance Week&quot; during the fall semester to commemorate the students. On December 21 a service in the university's chapel at 2:03&nbsp;p.m. (19:03&nbsp;<a>UTC</a>) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded. The University also maintains a link to the tragedy with the &quot;Remembrance Scholars&quot; program, when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the University. With the &quot;Lockerbie Scholars&quot; program, two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Crouse College, a 19th-century neo-Romanesque building which houses the visual arts and music programs</a> [[Image:Syracuse U Quad Spring 2005.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Quad, the center of the Main Campus. On the west end is Hendricks Chapel, with the [[Carrier Dome]] to its left]] The university is set on a campus that features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century <a>Romanesque</a> structures to contemporary buildings designed by renowned architects such as <a>I.M. Pei</a>. The center of campus, with its grass quadrangle, landscaped walkways, and outdoor sculptures, offers students the amenities of a traditional college experience. The university overlooks <a>Downtown Syracuse</a>, a medium-sized city (140,600 residents in 2008).  The school also owns a <a>Sheraton Hotel</a>, Drumlins Country Club&#x2014;a nearby <a>golf course</a>, the <a>Joseph I. Lubin</a> House in <a>New York City</a>, the Paul Greenberg House in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, and the Minnowbrook Conference Center, a 30 acre (121,000 m&#x00b2;) retreat in the <a>Adirondack Mountains</a> of <a>Upstate New York</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Joseph Lubin House, Manhattan</a></p>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>Also called &quot;North Campus,&quot; the Main Campus contains nearly all academic buildings and residence halls. Its centerpiece is &quot;The Quad&quot;, which is surrounded by academic and administrative buildings. The North Campus represents a large portion of the <a>University Hill</a> neighborhood. Buses run to South Campus, as well as <a>Downtown Syracuse</a> and other locations in the city. About 70 percent of students live in University housing. First- and second-year students are required to live on campus. All but one of 22 residence halls are coeducational and each contain a lounge, laundry facility, and various social/study spaces. Residence halls are secured with a card access system. Residence halls are located on both Main Campus and South Campus, the latter of which is a five minute ride via bus.  Learning communities and interest housing options are also available. Food facilities include five residential dining centers, two food courts, and several cafes.</p>
<p>The <a>Comstock Tract Buildings</a>, a historic district of older buildings on the campus, was listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1980.  Three buildings on campus&mdash;the <a>Crouse Memorial College</a> and the <a>Hall of Languages</a>, and the <a>Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity</a>&mdash;are individually listed on the National Register.</p>
<p>A few blocks walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St, the <a>Syracuse Stage</a> building includes two <a>proscenium</a> theatres. The Storch is used primarily by the Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage, a professional <a>regional theatre</a>.</p>
<h3>South campus</h3>
<p>After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill owned by the university was used to house returning <a>veterans</a> in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small freshman-only residence halls which feature open doubles and a kitchen on every floor. South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics located in the Manley Athletics Complex. Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.</p>
<h3>Downtown</h3>
<p>In December 2004, the university announced that it had purchased or leased twelve buildings in <a>downtown Syracuse</a>. Two programs, Communications Design and Advertising Design from the College of Visual and Performing Arts reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called <a>The Warehouse</a>, which was renovated by <a>Gluckman Mayner Architects</a>. Both programs were chosen to be located in the downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12&nbsp;million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems, led by Syracuse University in partnership with <a>Clarkson University</a> and the <a>College Environmental Science and Forestry</a>, creates innovations in environmental and energy technologies that improve human health and productivity, security, and sustainability in urban and built environments. The Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company and the Community Folk Art Center will also be located downtown. On March 31, 2006, the university and the city announced an initiative to connect the main campus of the university with the arts and culture areas of downtown Syracuse and The Warehouse. At a new green data center, an natural gas-fueled on-site electrical co-generation system generates 100 percent of the center&#x2019;s electricity while helping cool a couple of buildings.</p>
<p>The Connective Corridor project, supported by of public and private funds, will be a strip of cultural development that will connect the main campus of the university to downtown Syracuse, NY. In 2008, an <a>engineering</a> firm is studying traffic patterns and lighting to commence the project. A design competition was held to determine the best design for the project.</p>
<h3>Los Angeles Center</h3>
<p>SU has established an admissions presence in Los Angeles, California that will enhance the University&#x2019;s visibility on the West Coast and will join the University&#x2019;s West Coast offices of alumni relations, institutional advancement, and the LA semester program in the same location.</p>
<h3>Art collection</h3>
<p>SU has a permanent art collection of over 45,000 objects from artists including Picasso, Rembrandt, Hopper, Tiffany and Wyeth. More than 100 important paintings, sculptures, and murals are displayed in public places around campus. Notable sculptures on campus include <a>Sol Lewitt</a>'s  <em>Six Curved Walls</em>, <a>Anna Hyatt Huntington</a>'s <em>Diana</em>, <a>Jean-Antoine Houdon</a>'s <em>George Washington</em>, <a>Antoine Bourdelle</a>'s <em>Herakles</em>, <a>James Earle Fraser</a>'s <em>Lincoln</em>, <a>Malvina Hoffman</a>'s <em>The Struggle of Elemental Man,</em> and <a>Ivan Mestrovic</a>'s <em>Moses</em>, <em>Job</em> and <em>Supplicant Persephone</em>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Syracuse is governed by a 70 member Board of Trustees, with 64 trustees elected by the Board to four-year terms, and six elected by the alumni to four-year terms.  Of the 64 Board elected Trustees, three must represent specified conferences of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>. In addition, the chancellor and the President of the Syracuse Alumni Association serve as ex officio voting Trustees. Two students and one faculty member serve as non-voting representatives to the Board of Trustees.  The Board of Trustees selects, and sets the salary of, the chancellor. Syarcuse chancellor <a>Nancy Cantor</a> is one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.4 million.</p>
<p>The Syracuse University Bylaws also establish a University Senate with &quot;general supervision over all educational matters concerning the University as a whole....&quot;  The Senate consists of administrators, faculty, students and staff.</p>
<p>ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from SU, even while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five <a>statutory college</a>s that are at <a>Alfred University</a> and <a>Cornell University</a>.</p>
<p>ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from SU to take part in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and joint commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and NAIA, respectively. First-year ESF students live in SU housing.</p>
<h4>State University of New York Upstate Medical University</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The medical school was formerly a college within SU, known as the Syracuse University Medical School. In 1950, SU sold the medical school to the <a>State University of New York</a> system. Beginning in the fall of 2009, a <a>Master of Public Health</a> degree program is now being offered by the two institutions. The program is the first of its kind in Central New York, and the first jointly offered by the two universities.</p>
<h3>Former Syracuse University Satellite Colleges</h3>
<h4>State University of New York at Binghamton</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Binghamton was established in 1946 as Triple Cities College to serve the needs of local veterans returning from World War II of the Triple Cities area. Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Originally, Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years of their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University, but the inception of the college is dated at 1946 when students could first earn their degree entirely in the Binghamton branch. In 1950, the campus was absorbed by SUNY and renamed Harpur College.</p>
<h4>Utica College</h4>
<p> <a>Utica College</a>, an independent private university located in <a>Utica, NY</a>, was founded by Syracuse University in 1946. Utica College became independent from SU in 1995, but still offers its students the option to receive a specialized bachelor's degree from Syracuse University through a mutual relationship between the two schools.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> For the Class of 2012, there were approximately 23,000 applicants for 3,060 seats in the Freshman class. The libraries have collectively over 3.16 million volumes. Syracuse participates in the <a>National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a> and <a>University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN)</a>.</p>

<h3>Media</h3>
<p><a>300px|right|thumb|The CitrusTV control room during a taping of CitrusTV News</a></p>
<p><a>CitrusTV</a> (formerly UUTV and HillTV) is the university's entirely student-run television studio. CitrusTV produces news, sports, and entertainment content that appears on the university's campus cable channel, the Orange Television Network, and online on the <a>CitrusTV.net</a> website and Syracuse.com. Some content also appears in Central New York on the cable channel <a>Time Warner Cable Sports</a>. The station used to be a part of University Union, the largest student organization on campus, until it split to become its own recognized student organization in 2004. The station was briefly known as HillTV until the middle of the fall 2005 semester, when the university shut the station down for controversial entertainment programming and demanded its reform. The station is located in the Robert B. Menschel Media Center, at the Waverly Avenue side of Watson Hall.</p>
<p>The school's independent student newspaper is <em><a>The Daily Orange</a></em>, founded in 1903 and independent since 1971. The D.O. Alumni Association recently celebrated the paper's 100th anniversary.</p>
<p><a>WAER</a> (88.3 <a>FM</a>) is located on the campus of SU, and is an auxiliary service of the school. The station features a jazz music and <a>National Public Radio</a> format, with a news and music staff providing 24-hour programming. It is best known for its sports staff, which has produced the likes of <a>Bob Costas</a>, <a>Marv Albert</a>, <a>Mike Tirico</a>, <a>Sean McDonough</a>, <a>Ian Eagle</a>, <a>Brian Higgins</a>, and <a>Dick Stockton</a>. <a>Lou Reed</a> also hosted a free-format show on WAER during his time at Syracuse University; this free-format radio tradition at Syracuse is carried on by WERW.</p>
<p><a>WJPZ</a> is a radio station owned and operated entirely by SU students. It broadcasts at 89.1 FM at an effective radiated power of 100 watts and can be heard throughout Syracuse, the rest of Onondaga County, and beyond to the north and east. WJPZ programs a tight CHR (Contemporary Hit Radio, or Top 40) format. Although operated by students, it is an independent organization which is incorporated and licensed by the FCC as WJPZ Radio, Inc. It is neither owned nor controlled by Syracuse University, but it does lease studio and transmitter facilities on Syracuse University property.</p>
<p><a>WERW</a> is the entirely student-run, free format <a>carrier current</a> <a>radio station</a> on the SU campus. It is the only campus radio station currently being broadcast on iTunes college radio. The station can also be heard at 1570 AM. The studios are located in the Schine Student Center. Originally operating at 750AM, WERW was available only in the university's dorms and some other campus buildings. The station's current low power broadcast tower was erected atop the Booth Hall dormitory in 1995 to allow it to broadcast at 1570AM. With this new tower, WERW could be heard all across the university campus and in adjacent areas of the city of Syracuse.</p>
<p>There are also multiple student-run magazines and other print publications, including: The Student Voice, Jerk Magazine, What the Health, 360, and Equal Time.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>Founded in 1957, the Student Association (SA) represents the undergraduate students of both SU and ESF. The SA, through the Student Assembly, oversees the allocation and designation of the Student Activity Fee that was first collected in the 1968&ndash;69 school year. The goals of the SA are to participate through a unified student voice in the formulation of Syracuse University rules and regulations. The SA-SGA Alumni Organization maintains the history and an organizational timeline on its website. Students elect two non-voting representatives to the Board of Trustees. Sororities were also a part of the early history of SU. <a>Alpha Phi</a> was founded at SU in 1872, followed by <a>Gamma Phi Beta</a> in 1874 and <a>Alpha Gamma Delta</a> in 1904. Every IFC fraternity and NPC sorority was established at SU during the 20th century. <a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a> established a chapter at SU in 1910, and was reorganized in 1949 and 1973. The first NPHC fraternity, <a>Omega Psi Phi</a>, was established at SU in 1922, and the first NPHC sorority, <a>Delta Sigma Theta</a> in 1973.</p>
<p>Current National Panhellenic Council Social Sororities and Syracuse University include Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Sigma Sigma, Pi Beta Phi, and Sigma Delta Tau.</p>

<p> [[Image:Syracuse Football 2005 Opener.jpg|thumb|250px|Syracuse Orange football team entering the [[Carrier Dome]].]] Syracuse University's sports teams have &quot;the Orange&quot; nickname since 2004, although the former names of Orangemen and Orangewomen are still used. The school's mascot is <a>Otto the Orange</a>. SU fields intercollegiate teams in eight men's sports and 12 women's sports.</p>
<p>All intercollegiate teams participate in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> in the <a>Big East Conference</a>, except the women's ice hockey team, which participates in <a>College Hockey America</a> and <a>crew</a>, which participates in the <a>Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges</a>. The men's and women's basketball teams, the football team, and both the men's and women's lacrosse teams play in the <a>Carrier Dome</a>. Other sports are located at the nearby <a>Manley Field House</a>.</p>
<p>SU reached 27 team national championships, including 14 men's lacrosse, six men's crew, two <a>cross country running</a>, and one each in <a>boxing</a> and <a>football</a>. Under long-time head coach <a>Jim Boeheim</a>, <a>men's basketball team</a> won seven <a>Big East</a> regular season championships, five <a>Big East Tournament</a> championships, and 25 <a>NCAA Tournament</a> appearances, including the <a>2003 NCAA championship</a>. Most recently, Syracuse reached the Sweet 16 of the 2010 NCAA tournament.

Bush</a> for their winning the <a>2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I national championship</a>.]]</p>
<p>In 1959, Syracuse earned its first <a>National Championship</a> following an undefeated football season and a Cotton Bowl victory over <a>Texas</a>. The team featured sophomore running back <a>Ernie Davis</a> who, in 1961, became the first African-American to win the <a>Heisman Trophy</a>. Davis was slated to play for the <a>Cleveland Browns</a> in the same backfield as <a>Jim Brown</a>, but died of <a>leukemia</a> before being able to play professionally.</p>
<p>Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It won USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse is the first school to capture 11 National Championships, the most of any team in college lacrosse history. Syracuse has won the past two men's Div I lacrosse championships.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, <a>Archbold Stadium</a>, was seventy years old and not up to the standards of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished to make way for the Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed <a>Teflon</a>-coated, <a>fiberglass</a> <a>inflatable roof</a>. It would also serve as the home for the men's basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House. The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85&nbsp;million, including a $2.75&nbsp;million <a>naming gift</a> from the <a>Carrier Corporation</a>.</p>
