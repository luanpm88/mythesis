<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|left|Rush Rhees Library in Summer. </a> --&gt;</p>
<p>The University of Rochester was founded in 1850 as a Baptist-sponsored institution. The impetus to form the university came primarily from the town of <a>Hamilton, New York</a>, which has been home to <a>Colgate University</a> since 1819. In 1848, the Baptist Education Society planned to move Colgate University (then known as Madison University) to the city of Rochester, but was halted by legal action. Dissenting Colgate trustees, faculty, and students founded the University of Rochester, receiving a charter from the <a>Regents of the University of the State of New York</a> on January 31, 1850. Classes began that November, with approximately 60 students enrolling, including 28 transfers from Madison. <a>thumb|Inside of the Great Hall of Rush Rhees.</a> The University of Rochester's campus was originally in downtown Rochester at the United States Hotel, which was located on Buffalo Street near Elizabeth Street, which today is West Main Street near the <a>I-490</a> overpass. In 1853, the campus moved east to a then-suburban location on what is now University Avenue. Local businessman and Congressman <a>Azariah Boody</a> donated  of land for the new campus, and the University purchased a further  from him. UR would remain on this campus until the current River Campus was constructed in 1930, and the university continues to own a small part of the University Avenue campus (where the university-owned Memorial Art Gallery is located). <a>400px|thumb|left|The iconic front of Rush Rhees Library.</a> The first female students were admitted in 1900, the result of an effort led by <a>Susan B. Anthony</a> and <a>Helen Barrett Montgomery</a>. During the 1890s, a number of women took classes and labs at the university as &quot;visitors&quot; but were not officially enrolled nor were their records included in the college register. President <a>David Jayne Hill</a> allowed the first woman, Helen E. Wilkinson, to enroll as a normal student, although she was not allowed to matriculate or to pursue a degree. Thirty-three women enrolled among the first class in 1900, and Ella S. Wilcoxen was the first to receive a degree, in 1901.</p>
<p>In 1995, university president <a>Thomas H. Jackson</a> announced the launch of a &quot;Renaissance Plan&quot; for The College that, among several changes, reduced enrollment and created a more selective admissions process. The plan also revised the undergraduate curriculum significantly, creating the current system with only one required course and only a few distribution requirements (known as &quot;clusters&quot;).</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p><a>200px|thumb|Statue of UR's first president, Martin Brewer Anderson.</a> The university is headed by a board of trustees, with Edmund A. Hajim being the chairman. The board appoints the president of the university, currently <a>Joel Seligman</a>, who replaced <a>Thomas H. Jackson</a> on July 1, 2005.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>River Campus</h3>
<p>[[Image:Wilson commons.JPG|300px|thumb|Wilson Commons student union. Designed by the architectural firm of [[I. M. Pei|I.M. Pei]].]]<a>thumb|left|Stairway in the Rush Rhees atrium.</a>  The <strong>River Campus</strong> is the center of the university's academic and administrative activities. It is located in a bend of the <a>Genesee River</a> about  south of downtown Rochester and covers around . It is bounded by Bausch &amp; Lomb Riverside Park, an  public park along the east bank of the Genesee River.</p>
<p>The original buildings of the campus were dedicated in 1930. The main academic buildings, designed in the Greek revival style, are centered around the <a>Eastman Quadrangle</a> (generally referred to as the academic quad) which is formed by <a>Rush Rhees Library</a> and Dewey, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Morey, and Lattimore Halls. The Eastman Quad is widely considered the best landscaped area of the university. Rush Rhees Library, the unofficial symbol of the university, is also home to the <a>Hopeman Memorial Carillon</a>, the largest carillon in New York State, featuring 50 bells that chime on the quarter hour. During the summer, the carillon features a recital series in which various artists perform on the instrument. <a>thumb|left|New George Eastman statue on River Campus.|Statue of George Eastman, the university's most generous benefactor. Unveiled on October 10, 2009 during Meliora Weekend.</a> Over the course of the last several decades, other academic buildings have been built south of the Eastman Quad, including Meliora Hall (1972), Hoyt Hall (1962), Harkness Hall (1946), Gavett Hall (dedicated with the Eastman Quad in 1930), and the Hopeman Engineering Building (1963). The southernmost part of the River Campus contains the new Science and Engineering Quadrangle: Hutchison Hall (1972), Hylan Building (1971), the Computer Studies Building and Carlson Library (1987), Wilmot Building (1961), and the <a>Robert B. Goergen</a> Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics (completed in March 2007).</p>
<p>Students often congregate outdoors during the warmer months on the various quads. Other centers of student life include Todd Union, <a>Frederick Douglass</a> Dining Center, various locations inside Rush Rhees Library, and Wilson Commons, a student union designed by the architectural firm of <a>I.M. Pei</a>. Many academic buildings, including Rush Rhees Library, are connected by a series of tunnels, which are used extensively, especially during unfavorable weather. Most academic buildings and common areas, as well as <a>Freshman</a> residence halls, have <a>authenticated</a> <a>Wi-Fi</a> internet access.</p>
<h3>Other campuses</h3>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>University of Rochester's <a>undergraduate</a> enrollment consists of about 4,500 full-time and about 100 part-time students from across the U.S. and over 90 countries. Graduate enrollment comprises about 3,300 full-time and about 550 part-time <a>graduate student</a>s. The university has more than 97,000 living alumni. The university employs more than 1,200 tenure-track faculty, with more than 17,000 faculty and staff across the university and the Strong Health System. UR's faculty include fellows of all four <a>National Academies</a> of the U.S., <a>Guggenheim Fellows</a>, and recipients of many other awards and recognitions.</p>
<p>The defining feature of the undergraduate program at the University is the Rochester Curriculum. There are no required subjects outside of a prerequisite writing course, which may be tested out of. The Curriculum requires that undergraduates study in all of three areas of knowledge: <a>humanities</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, and <a>natural sciences</a>. Aside from the area of study which a student's major falls in, undergraduates must complete 3-4 courses of related materials (called &quot;clusters&quot;) within each of the remaining areas. For example, a student with a concentration in <a>mathematics</a>, a natural science field, must complete at least one cluster in the humanities and one in social sciences. A second concentration or a <a>minor</a> also satisfies this requirement. The only exceptions are students concentrating in an <a>accredited</a> <a>engineering</a> field (<a>biomedical engineering</a>, <a>chemical engineering</a>, <a>electrical and computer engineering</a> or <a>mechanical engineering</a>), who are only required to have one cluster in either humanities or social sciences.</p>
<p>The University of Rochester is known for its several unique 5th year programs.  Students may apply for the <strong>Take Five Scholars</strong> program, a tuition free 5th year of study in a field of interest unrelated to their undergraduate major.  The university also offers a <strong>Kauffman Entrepreneurial Year</strong> (<strong>KEY</strong>) Scholarship, a tuition-free 5th year of study offered to those with an innovative and unique entrepreneurial project impacting the campus or Rochester community. Both programs are competitive and students may apply during their junior or senior year.</p>
<p>Various other scholar programs exist for UR students, including the highly selective <a>Rochester Early Medical Scholars</a> (<strong>REMS</strong>) and Rochester Early Business Scholar (<strong>REBS</strong>) programs. Students must apply for these prior to entering the university.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>300px|thumb|left|Flagpole on the River Campus bearing the seal of the university.</a><a>300px|thumb|right|Eastman Quad from the balcony of Rush Rhees Library.</a> UR's official symbol is the seal of the university, which features a book, representing <a>arts and sciences</a>, a lyre symbolizing music, and a modified <a>symbol of medicine</a>. The official flower of the university is the <a>dandelion</a>, purportedly prolific on the cow pasture that became the university's first campus.</p>
<p>The mascot is the <a>Yellowjacket</a>. From 1983 to 2008, it was named &quot;URBee&quot;. However, when the university re-designed the mascot during the 2007-2008 academic year, a new name was chosen and as of February 1, 2008, the school's mascot is now known as &quot;Rocky&quot;.</p>
<p>The university uses Dandelion Yellow and a shade of blue (Rochester blue) as its official colors, which are the prominent colors on the official regalia.</p>
<p>The <a>motto</a> of UR is <a>Meliora</a>, which loosely translates to &quot;better&quot; with the connotation of &quot;ever better&quot;, the meaning adopted by the university.</p>
<p>The image of <a>Rush Rhees Library</a>'s main dome serves as an additional icon for the University of Rochester.</p>
<p>UR also has official logos for the university as a whole as well as individual units, including The College, URMC and Eastman. President Seligman, as part of his efforts to improve UR's external appearance, commissioned Bill Murphy, the Vice President of Communications, to start an initiative to develop a new graphic identity, including a new logo, in hopes of improving uniformity and overall usage of official standards. During March 2007, the communications office was soliciting opinions and comments on finalist designs for the new logo, which was unveiled later that fall.</p>
<p>The song most often sung at college events, led often by the school's many <a>a cappella</a> groups, is <em><a>The Genesee</a></em>. Although less frequently used, the university also has an official <a>Alma Mater</a>, <em>The Dandelion Yellow</em>.</p>

The University of Rochester is also home to its own radio station, <a>WRUR</a>.</p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p>The majority of undergraduate students at the university live and take classes on the River Campus. Underclassmen are generally required to live on campus while upperclassmen have the option to live off campus. Some graduate housing is provided by the university, but a significant number also live off campus. Housing is provided at multiple locations spread across the several campuses.</p>
<p><strong>River Campus</strong> River Campus residences house primarily undergraduates, with some graduate students serving as Graduate Head Residents (GHRs). Residences include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fraternity Quad</strong> - Made up of nine houses. Seven fraternities (<a>Alpha Delta Phi</a>, <a>Delta Kappa Epsilon</a>, <a>Psi Upsilon</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Mu</a>, <a>Sigma Chi</a>, <a>Delta Upsilon</a>, and <a>Theta Chi</a>) and two special interest housing groups (Community Learning Center and Drama House) maintain housing here. Psi Upsilon is currently disaffiliated from the university, and the house will remain empty until 2013.</li>
  <li><strong>Freshman Housing</strong> - Consists of Susan B. Anthony Halls (Gannett, Gates, Hollister, and Morgan), located near Rush Rhees Library, Hoeing Hall, Tiernan Hall, and Gilbert Hall, which are located on the Residence Quad.  Freshmen live together in these specially designated residences that feature increased supervision, regulation, and residence-related activities by upperclassmen Dandelions (affectionately known as D'Lions) and Freshman Fellows, along with Residential Advisers in living areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Hill Court</strong> - Upperclass housing consisting of Chambers, Fairchild, Gale, Kendrick, Munro, and Slater houses, which are connected by underground tunnels. This residence area, opened in 1969, is colloquially known as &quot;Phase&quot; and was the newest residential area on the River Campus prior to the construction of the Riverview Complex.</li>
</ul>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|Wilson Quad during a snowstorm</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Residence Quad (ResQuad)</strong> - Consists of Burton, Crosby, Lovejoy, and Tiernan Halls for upperclassmen, as well as Hoeing and Gilbert Halls for freshmen. Burton and Crosby were the original dormitories on the River Campus, constructed in 1930, while the other four were built during the 1950s. All ResQuad buildings were fully renovated in the 1990s.</li>
  <li><strong>River Campus Towers</strong> - Consists of Anderson and Wilder Towers and houses upperclassmen and several Special Interest Housing groups. The formal name for the area is <strong>Founders Court</strong>, but it is simply called &quot;Towers&quot; by most students. Built in 1962, they are scheduled to undergo extensive renovations in the near future.</li>
  <li><strong>Southside / Graduate Living Center (GLC)</strong> - Colloquially known GLC - pronounced &quot;glick&quot;, Southside consists of Valentine and deKiewiet Towers, as well as several &quot;maisonettes&quot;, which offer apartment style living to upperclassmen. The residences tend to serve as overflow space for student housing. The residences are located south of the River Campus near the medical center, but house River Campus undergraduate students. The campus master plan shows that this complex will eventually be razed.</li>
  <li><strong>Riverview</strong> - The only housing complex on the western side of the Genesee River, Riverview is the newest housing complex for the campus, opening for the 2008-2009 school year, making it the first addition to the campus's housing in nearly 40 years.  The complex consists of five buildings, which can house up to 400 people, approximately 250 of which will be undergraduates in its first year, with plans to make it entirely undergraduate housing as the University expands. The complex is made up of fully furnished two-to-four person apartments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Interest floors and Fraternity floors also exist within the residence halls. Special Interest Housing groups include the International Living Center (ILC), Interclass Living Center (ICLC - Crosby 1), Music Interest Floor (MIF - Wilder 9), Health and Home (Valentine 6), Computer Interest Floor (CIF - Anderson 3), Tiernan Project (Burton 2), Media Living Center (MLC - Anderson 7), Film Interest Floor (FIF - Kendrick 1) and Anime Interest Floor (AIF - Anderson 7).</p>
<p><strong>Eastman School of Music Campus</strong> Housing is provided at the <a>Eastman School of Music</a> campus at the <strong>Eastman Student Living Center</strong> at 100 Gibbs Street in downtown Rochester. The new building was opened in 1991 at the northeast corner of Main and Gibbs Streets, replacing the University Avenue dormitories built nearly 70 years earlier. It is a four-story quadrangle and 16-story tower surrounding a landscaped inner courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>URMC and Mount Hope Campuses</strong> Graduate student housing is provided at 4 locations near the URMC and Mount Hope.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>George Washington Goler House</strong> (<strong>GHS</strong>) immediately adjacent to the grounds of the URMC. It is a high rise apartment building with 321 apartments. The building also houses university community members, including faculty and staff.</li>
  <li><strong>University Towne House</strong> (<strong>UTH</strong>) is a group-living style, two story building located on the Mount Hope Campus with 60 studios. The building is adjacent to Mount Hope businesses as well as university offices.</li>
  <li><strong>University Park</strong> (<strong>UPK</strong>) is a complex of two story buildings that include 40 studio, 86 one-bedroom, and 80 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments. UPK is located near the URMC off of Kendrick Road.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>South Campus</strong> The South Campus has graduate student housing at the <strong>Whipple Park</strong> (<strong>WPK</strong>) complex, which features 250 garden apartments and townhouses with ample storage space. WPK also features a park-like setting with large wooded and lawn areas, playgrounds, areas for gardens and low street noise. Some housing is also provided at the <strong>River Road</strong> complex, which tends to serve as overflow housing for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<h3>Students' Association</h3>
<p><a>300px|thumb|The old student union, Todd Union (now home to the Music and Theater departments), with its replacement, Wilson Commons, in the background.</a> The <strong>Students' Association</strong> (<strong>SA</strong>) is the primary student governing body and includes most of the student groups at UR. The SA is governed by the SA Senate, President and Vice President, all of whom are elected by the student body. The SA President is advised by a cabinet, which is a volunteer group of students. There is also a judicial branch, composed of the All Campus Judicial Council (ACJC), the members of whom are nominated by an interview committee and approved by the SA Senate. The offices of the SA are located in the Wilson Commons student union.</p>
<p>All student groups are required to have a constitution, elected officers, and approval from senate in order to be recognized by the SA and have access to university funds. These funds are given yearly based on budgets submitted to the Students' Association Appropriation Committee (SAAC) with supplemental funds available through special forms. All funds are derived from the mandatory Student Activities Fee.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>UR's athletics teams are called the <a>Yellowjacket</a>s. They participate in the <a>Division III</a> of the <a>NCAA</a> and in the <a>University Athletic Association</a> and <a>Liberty League</a>. One exception to this is the men's <a>squash</a> team, which plays in <a>Division I</a>.  The University fields men's teams in <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>swimming</a> and <a>diving</a>, <a>tennis</a>, and <a>track and field</a>.  On the women's side, UR sponsors teams in <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>rowing</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>swimming</a> and <a>diving</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>track and field</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>.</p>
<p>In 2009 women's soccer coach <a>Terry Gurnett</a> set records with over 400 lifetime wins. In March 2010 the women's basketball team made it to the NCAA's Final Four.</p>
<p>There are also numerous club and intramural athletics groups.</p>
<p>The main athletics facilities of the university are in the <a>Robert B. Goergen</a> Athletic Center and Fauver Stadium on the River Campus, with other facilities located in the Spurrier building (River Campus) and the URMC.</p>
<h3>Campus and area transportation</h3>
<p> The UR campuses have their own University-sponsored system of buses, or shuttles, which provide free transportation from the River Campus to the Medical Center, South Campus, Eastman Campus, and Riverview. There are also lines that run between the River Campus and local shopping and entertainment in <a>Henrietta</a> and <a>Pittsford</a>.  On the weekends, a shuttle loops to the Rochester <a>Public Market</a>, a student favorite.  Most of the University-sponsored buses are named using a color system (i.e. Red Line) that indicates their respective route and allows for easy identification. Several bus lines of the <a>Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority</a> (RTS) also make stops at the University.</p>
<p>The university participates in the <a>Zipcar</a> program, which allows students to rent cars on an hourly or daily basis.</p>
<p>The <a>Greater Rochester International Airport</a> is a ten-minute drive to the west of the River Campus. In addition, <a>Amtrak train</a> and <a>Greyhound bus</a> have stations in downtown Rochester to the north of the campus.</p>
