<p>Central has a history of interesting architectural features.  The first buildings of the new college in 1853 are Dutch Colonial and part of the present day Strawtown Inn.

<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p>Central is currently home to eight local fraternities and sororities.

<p>All of Central's Greek organizations are local and have no chapters at other colleges.</p>
<p>Central College has a policy of &quot;deferred recruitment&quot; regarding Greek organizations; first-year students must be enrolled for at least one semester before they are allowed to pledge.</p>
<p>;Beta Kappa Epsilon <a>Beta Kappa Epsilon</a> (&#x0392;&#x039a;&#x0395;) is Central's oldest fraternity and was founded in 1947. Both the group and its members are usually referred to as &quot;the Beakes&quot;.</p>
<p>;Phi Delta Tau Phi Delta Tau (&#x03a6;&#x0394;&#x03a4;) which stands for Brotherhood Power and Honor became Central's second fraternity in 1961.  Their colors are yellow and gold and its members are referred to as &quot;Phi Delts&quot; and they have traditionally hosted the annual gallon challenge (milk) and also the King of Hearts Dance every Valentine's Day. They have a rich tradition with many faculty members once being active Phi Delts in their day. </p>
<p>;Theta Kappa Alpha Theta Kappa Alpha (&#x0398;&#x039a;A) was the third fraternity to be founded at Central in 1967. Commonly known as the &quot;Thetas&quot;, the fraternity prides itself on its longstanding principles of service, academic excellence, and unity through diversity. The members of Theta Kappa Alpha host Central's annual Lemming Race (see &quot;Traditions&quot;). </p>
<p>;Sigma Phi Omega Sigma Phi Omega (&#x03a3;&#x03a6;&#x03a9;) became Central's first sorority in 1969. The Sigmas are best known for their work with the blood drives that are brought to campus each semester by the Blood Center of Iowa. They help with advertising, recruiting donors, and assisting at the donation site.</p>
<p>;Alpha Delta Epsilon Alpha Delta Epsilon sorority (A&#x0394;&#x0415;) was founded in 1971.  The Alpha Delts' colors are maroon, gold, white and violet.  The sorority's motto is &quot;Sisterhood, Sincerity, and Service to All&quot; and their flower is the yellow rose.  The sister's creed is &quot;Working together, We are Sisters&quot;.  </p>
<p>;Alpha Zeta Chi Alpha Zeta Chi (AZX) was founded as an all-male fraternity in 1988, on the principles of looking beyond people's differences and respecting each individual's dignity, and with the goal of improving the social climate at Central College. In 1998, AZX began accepting female members, thus becoming Central's first co-ed fraternity. Furthermore, Alpha Zeta Chi does not deny membership on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, nationality, physical ability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.  They are known for hosting the &quot;Virgin Mixer&quot; every fall at which students can mingle and enjoy virgin drinks.</p>
<p>;Zeta Upsilon Zeta Upsilon (ZY) is a sorority that was founded in 1995 and established in 1996. They are the second youngest sorority on campus. They have been known for having a fall dinner at their house, and a spring semester tug-o-war on study day.</p>
<p>;Psi Sigma Tau Psi Sigma Tau (&#x03a8;&#x03a3;&#x03a4;) is Central's newest group, having been tentatively approved by Greek Council in the spring of 2006. It is the first group to be founded as a co-ed fraternity.</p>
