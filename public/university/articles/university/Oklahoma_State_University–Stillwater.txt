<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Old Central.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Central]] at Oklahoma A&amp;M, 1894]] On December 25, 1890, the <a>Oklahoma Territorial</a> Legislature finally gained approval for <strong>Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M)</strong> College, the <a>land-grant</a> university established under the Morrill Act of 1862. It specified that the college was to be within <a>Payne County</a>. Such an ambiguous description created rivalry between towns within the county, with Stillwater ultimately winning out. Upon statehood in 1907, &quot;Territorial&quot; was dropped from its title.</p>
<p>The first students assembled for class on December 14, 1891. Classes were held for two and one-half years in local churches until the first academic building, later known as <a>Old Central</a>, was dedicated on June 15, 1894, on the southeast corner of campus, which at the time was flat plowed prairie. In 1896, <strong>Oklahoma A&amp;M</strong> held its first commencement with six male graduates. The first Library was established in Old Central in one room shared with the English Department.  The first campus building to have electricity, Williams Hall, was constructed in 1900. With its turreted architecture it was referred to as the &quot;Castle of the Prairies&quot;; It remained standing until 1969. One of the earliest campus buildings was also a barn, used as part of an agricultural experiment station, which was served by a large reservoir pond created in 1895.  The barn burned in 1922, but the pond, enlarged and remodeled in 1928 and 1943, is now known as Theta Pond, a popular campus scenic landmark.  In 1906, Morrill Hall was completed and became the principal building on campus. A fire gutted the building in 1914, but the outside structure survived intact, and the interior was reconstructed. The first dormitory for women was completed in 1911. It contained a kitchen, dining hall, some classrooms, and a women's gymnasium.  It is now the Bartlett Center for the Studio Arts and houses the <a>Gardiner Art Gallery</a>. By 1919 the campus included Morrill Hall, the Central Building, the Engineering Building (now Gunderson Hall), the Women's building, the Auditorium (replaced later by the <a>Seretean Center for Performing Arts</a>), the Armory-Gymnasium (now the Architecture Building) and the Power Plant.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Student Union Building at OSU</a> Much of the growth of Oklahoma A&amp;M and the campus architectural integrity can be attributed to work of <a>Henry G. Bennett</a>, who served as the school's president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the physical expansion of the university campus. The plan was adopted in 1937 and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, making the university what it is today, including the <a>Georgian architecture</a> that permeates the campus. The focal point of his vision was a centrally located library building, which became a reality when the <a>Edmon Low Library</a> opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the construction of the Student Union, which opened in 1950. Subsequent additions and renovations have made the building one of the largest student union buildings in the world at . A complete renovation and further expansion of the building began in 2010.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Statue of Henry G. Bennett near Library Lawn at OSU</a>  On May 15, 1957, <strong>Oklahoma A&amp;M</strong> changed its name for the final time to <strong>Oklahoma State University</strong> to reflect the broadening scope of curriculum offered.  Subsequently, the <a>Oklahoma State University System</a> was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: <a>OSU-Institute of Technology</a> in <a>Okmulgee</a> (1946), <a>OSU-Oklahoma City</a> (1961), <a>OSU-Tulsa</a> (1984) and the <a>Center for Health Sciences</a> also in <a>Tulsa</a> (1988).</p>
<p>In 2005, OSU announced its &quot;Campus Master Plan&quot;, a campaign to enhance academic, athletic, and administrative facilities. Over $800 million is ear-marked for campus construction and renovation over twenty years. The Plan calls for an &quot;athletic village&quot; where all of the university's athletic facilities will be located on the main campus. To accomplish this goal, the athletic department bought all (or nearly all) the property north of <a>Boone Pickens Stadium</a> up to McElroy between Knoblock and Washington streets. This drew criticism from the city of Stillwater and property owners.  While the vast majority of the real estate was rental property targeting college students, a few owners were longtime residents. There was a lone holdout in this parcel of land, who sued OSU over their right to use <a>eminent domain</a>. The case was decided in favor of the University. The project includes the construction of an indoor practice facility for most sports, a soccer stadium/outdoor track, a tennis complex, and a baseball stadium.</p>
<p>In 2006, OSU become the recipient of a gift of $165 million from alumni <a>T. Boone Pickens</a> to the university's athletic department, and in 2008 received another gift from Pickens of $100 million for endowed academic chairs.  It was  the largest gift for academics ever given in the state.  In February, 2010, Pickens announced that he was contributing another $100 Million to fund a scholarship endowment as part of a $1 Billion fund-raising campaign titled &quot;Branding Success.&quot; The gift brought the total contributed to OSU  by Pickens to over $500 Million. The &quot;Branding Success&quot; campaign seeks to raise about $500 Million for endowed scholarships and fellowships for students, $200 million toward attracting and retaining professors and researchers, $200 million for the construction and upgrading of educational and research facilities and $100 million to create and sustain programs and services to benefit Oklahomans.  One of the first endowed professorships established through the campaign is the Temple Grandin Endowed Professorship in Animal Behavior and Well-Being, named in honor of animal scientist and autistic expert <a>Temple Grandin</a>.</p>
<p>Oklahoma State has hosted a number of high-profile speakers throughout the years, including several sitting presidents. <a>Richard Nixon</a>, <a>George H.W. Bush</a>, and <a>George W. Bush</a> all gave commencement addresses while they were in office.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Current university-owned housing options include 26 residence halls, more than 15 dining options, and seven family-first apartment complexes. In recent years, on-campus housing has been undergoing significant transformation. Student living was previously dominated by traditional dormitories; however, apartment-style buildings now comprise approximately half of the living quarters. In 2005, the high-rise Willham North and South residential halls that once dominated the Stillwater skyline were demolished and replaced with the Village suites on its site. Iba Hall, another traditional dorm, was closed in 2007. Parker Hall is also slated to be closed at the end of the 2008-2009 school year for temporary use as offices for departments that will be displaced by renovations of the Student Union.</p>
<p>Kerr-Drummond, Parker, Wentz and Stout Halls continue to offer traditional dormitory accommodations. Apartments for single students are Bost, Davis, Morsani-Smith, Peterson-Friend, Kamm, Sitlington and Young Halls. Housing in suite-style accommodations are provided in the named Village CASNR (College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources), Village HES (Human and Environmental Science), Village C, Village D, Village E and Village F. Deluxe suites are provided in Patchin &amp; Jones, Bennett, Zink &amp; Allen, and Stinchcomb &amp; Booker Halls. Graduate students and families are offered accommodations in seven apartment &quot;neighborhoods&quot; with a variety of floor plans and amenities: Brumley, Demaree, Morrison, Prosser, Stevens, West and Williams.</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of learning communities and special interest housing options are available, providing opportunity for students who share interests or majors to live together. Most of these communities occupy certain floors of buildings or halls, rather than consisting of separate buildings. Included among the options are: FIT (Freshman in Transition, College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources), athletic training, career exploration (College of Arts and Sciences), computer science house, engineering houses, health and sciences house, HES house (College of Human and Environmental Sciences), journalism and broadcasting house, Kamm Leadership House, Ketchum House (Native American interests), Maude's Quad (Women in Engineering House), Recovery House (students recovering from drug and/or alcohol dependence), Spanish House (language immersion), Spears School of Business House, Stout Honors housing (University's Honors Program), Uhuru House (African Centered Cultural House), Wellness House, and The Transfer Zone (transfer students).</p>
