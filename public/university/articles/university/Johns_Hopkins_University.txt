<p> <strong>The Johns Hopkins University</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Johns Hopkins</strong>, <strong>JHU</strong>, or simply <strong>Hopkins</strong>, is a <a>private</a> <a>research university</a> based in <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>Maryland</a>, <a>United States</a>. Johns Hopkins maintains campuses in <a>Maryland</a>, <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, <a>Italy</a>, <a>China</a>, and <a>Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>The university was founded on January 22, 1876 and named for its benefactor, the <a>philanthropist</a> <a>Johns Hopkins</a>. <a>Daniel Coit Gilman</a> was inaugurated as first <a>president</a> on February 22, 1876.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins is ranked 18th internationally in the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, 13th in the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> for 2010-11. Hopkins is also 2nd and 3rd worldwide in the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP)  and the <a>HEEACT &#x2013; Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities</a>, respectively. Over time, 33 <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners have been affiliated with Johns Hopkins (only 13 schools claim more), and the university is among the most cited institutions in the world.</p>
<p>The <a>National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) has ranked Johns Hopkins #1 among U.S. academic institutions in total science, medical and <a>engineering</a> <a>research and development</a> spending for 31 consecutive years. At that time this fortune, generated primarily from the <a>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a>, was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>The first name of philanthropist <a>Johns Hopkins</a> is the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins. They named their son Johns Hopkins, and his name was passed on to his grandson, the university's benefactor.</p>
<p>In his 2001 undergraduate commencement address, university president <a>William R. Brody</a> said about the name: &quot;In 1888, just 12 years after the university was founded, <a>Mark Twain</a> wrote about this university in a letter to a friend. He said: 'A few months ago I was told that the Johns Hopkins University had given me a degree. I naturally supposed this constituted me a Member of the Faculty, and so I started in to help as I could there. I told them I believed they were perfectly competent to run a college as far as the higher branches of education are concerned, but what they needed was a little help here and there from a practical commercial man. I said the public is sensitive to little things, and they wouldn't have full confidence in a college that didn't know how to spell the name <em>John</em>.' More than a century later, we continue to bestow diplomas upon individuals of outstanding capabilities and great talent. And we continue to spell <em>Johns</em> with an <em>s</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><a>Milton Eisenhower</a>, once the university' president, once spoke to a convention in <a>Pittsburgh</a>. Making a common mistake, the <a>Master of Ceremonies</a> introduced him as &quot;President of <em>John</em>&lt;!--[sic]---&gt; Hopkins.&quot; Eisenhower retorted that he was &quot;glad to be here in <em>Pitt</em>burgh.&lt;!--[sic]---&gt;&quot;</p>
<h3>Early years and Daniel Coit Gilman</h3>
<p>The original board opted for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge at an advanced level, extending that of contemporary Germany. Johns Hopkins thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United States. Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States from a focus on teaching revealed and/or applied knowledge to the scientific discovery of new knowledge. The university was intended to be national in scope for a country divided in the aftermath of the <a>American Civil War</a>. Therefore, the university's official inauguration took on great significance: <a>1876</a> was the nation's centennial year and February 22 was <a>George Washington</a>'s birthday.</p>
<p>The University's viability depended on the first president, <a>Daniel Coit Gilman</a>, recruited from the presidency of the <a>University of California</a>. Gilman launched what many at the time considered to be an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: &quot;The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent, and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory,&quot; he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known luminaries such as the biologist <a>H. Newell Martin</a>; the physicist <a>Henry A. Rowland</a> (the first president of the <a>American Physical Society</a>), the <a>classical scholars</a> <a>Basil Gildersleeve</a> and Charles D. Morris; the economist <a>Richard T. Ely</a>; and the chemist <a>Ira Remsen</a>, who became the second president of the university in 1901.[[File:Daniel Coit Gilman.jpg|left|thumb|110px|&lt;center&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman]]&lt;/center&gt;]] Gilman focused on the expansion of knowledge, graduate education, and support of faculty research. To Gilman, Johns Hopkins existed not for the sake of God, the state, the community, the board, the parents, or even the students, but for knowledge. Faculty who expanded this knowledge were rewarded. A complementary focus on <a>graduate education</a> fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in doctoral programs and the host for numerous <a>scholarly journal</a>s and associations with the founding of the first <a>university press</a> in 1878. With the completion of <a>Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> in 1889 and the <a>medical school</a> in 1893, the university's research focused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine, including <a>William Osler</a>, <a>William Halsted</a>, <a>Howard Kelly</a>, and <a>William Welch</a>. During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a <a>Bachelors degree</a>, based on the efforts of <a>Mary E. Garrett</a>, who had endowed the school at Gilman's request.</p>
<p>In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the university's endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to &quot;build men, not buildings.&quot; In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The <a>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> from which most of the interest would have been generated became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins's death. The university's first home was thus in Downtown <a>Baltimore</a> with plans to move the university to Clifton in the future. This decision became the only major criticism of Gilman's presidency. In the early 1900s the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and so the estate became a public park. In the end, the  estate in north Baltimore known as <a>Homewood</a> was purchased as the university's new campus with assistance from prominent Baltimore citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Civil rights</h3>
<h4>African-Americans</h4>
<p>Hopkins was a prominent <a>abolitionist</a> who supported <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> during the <a>American Civil War</a>. After his death his conviction was reported to be a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins' first <a>African-American</a> student, <a>Kelly Miller</a>, a graduate student in physics, astronomy and mathematics, and in admitting Harvard-trained physician Whitfield Winsey and two other African-American physicians to Maryland's Medical and Chirurgical Society <a>MedChi</a>. These physicians could attend meetings only because they were held on campus. As the memory of Hopkins faded and trustees like King died, Hopkins became like other Baltimore institutions, particularly in terms of race. The Johns Hopkins University chronology stated that on March 15, 1892, an administrator hired by Gilman recommended that the hospital should have a &quot;separate ward for colored patients&quot;. Johns Hopkins Hospital subsequently became a segregated facility. Johns Hopkins' &quot;separate but equal&quot; stance was evident when it came to these segregated wards: &quot;Special care will be taken to see that the heating and ventilation apparatus is as perfect as possible. A sun balcony will be erected on each floor on the east side, for convalescents, while a sun bay-window will be constructed at the south end of the south wing. On each floor there will be a dining room, kitchen, lavatory and bath-rooms...The building will be <a>fireproof</a> throughout.&quot;</p>
<p>The first African-American instructor was laboratory supervisor <a>Vivien Thomas</a>, who also invented and developed research instruments, served as an assistant in surgery to surgeon <a>Alfred Blalock</a>, and worked closely with Blalock and <a>Helen Taussig</a> in developing and conducting the first successful <a>blue baby operation</a>. Black students a nd professionals were rare at Johns Hopkins Institutions and Maryland's state medical societies until after the 1940s. Diversity increased only in the 1960s and 1970s. African-Americans and women were labeled &quot;The Uninvited&quot; in the second major history of the university.</p>
<h4>Women</h4>
<p>The most well-known battle for women's rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university; <a>Mary E. Garrett</a>, <a>M. Carey Thomas</a>, Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth King, and Julia Rogers. They donated funds, raised the funds needed to open the medical school, and required Hopkins' officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted to Hopkins. Unfortunately, this stipulation applied only to the medical school. Other graduate schools were eventually opened to women by president <a>Ira Remsen</a>, in 1907. <a>Christine Ladd-Franklin</a> was the first woman to earn a <a>PhD</a> at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882. The trustees denied her the degree and refused to change the policy about admitting women; she finally received her degree 44 years later.</p>
<p>The <a>nursing school</a> opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students. In 1893 Florence Bascomb became the university's first female PhD.</p>
<h3>Modern times</h3>
<p>The <a>Johns Hopkins University Press</a>, founded in 1878, is the oldest American <a>university press</a> in continuous operation. Along with the hospital, Hopkins established one of the nation's oldest <a>schools of nursing</a> in 1889. The <a>school of medicine</a> was the nation's first coeducational, graduate-level medical school and the prototype for academic medicine which emphasized bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training. In 1909, the university was among the first to start adult <a>continuing education</a> programs and in 1916 it founded the US' first <a>school of public health</a>. Programs in international studies and the performing arts were established in 1950 and 1977 when the <a>Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies</a> in Washington D.C and the <a>Peabody Institute</a> in Baltimore became divisions of the university.</p>
<p>Milton S. Eisenhower led Johns Hopkins during the 1950s and 1960s when the university's income tripled, <a>endowment</a> doubled, ambitious building projects were undertaken, and ties with Washington, D.C. were developed.</p>
<p>Though privately endowed, Hopkins embodies what <a>Clark Kerr</a> called the &quot;federal grant university&quot;, prolific in obtaining federal research and development expenditures. Hopkins success reveals the priorities of grant authorities, as the school's humanities programs do not attract research funding commensurate with that attracted by <a>medicine</a>, <a>public health</a>, <a>engineering</a>, and <a>physics</a>; despite this, its humanities programs are highly ranked. Federal funding enables the university to remain Baltimore's largest employer.</p>

<p>The first campus was located on Howard Street. Eventually, they relocated to Homewood, in northern Baltimore, the estate of Charles Carroll, son of the oldest surviving signer of the <a>Declaration of Independence</a>. Carroll's <a>Homewood House</a> is considered to be one of the finest examples of Federal residential architecture. The estate then came to the Wyman family, which participated in making it the park-like main campus of the schools of arts and sciences and engineering at the turn of the 20th century. Most of its architecture was modeled after the <a>Federal style</a> of <a>Homewood House</a>. <a>Homewood House</a> is preserved as a museum. Most undergraduate programs are here.<img></p>

<h2>Campus environmental initiatives</h2>
<p>Johns Hopkins University has implemented a number of <a>sustainability</a> initiatives. Energy retrofits in certain buildings have resulted in over 50% less energy consumption.  In 2011, the <em>Sustainable Endowments Institute</em> gave Johns Hopkins a  College Sustainability Report Card grade of &quot;C+.&quot; In particular the Institute criticized JHU for failing to disclose its endowment's holdings and proxy voting record on environmental issues.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>In 2007 carbon emissions were inventoried and electric vehicles were used for some campus transportation needs. </p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>As of 2007 dining services managers sought locally sourced produce and seafood, and integrated organic food into menus. Each year, students conduct the &quot;S.E.X.:I.T.&quot; competition to see which dormitory can save the most electricity.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in 1986. The latter has grown to be the bigger entity with FY 2005 consolidated net revenue of $3.3 billion, employing 27,700 people, including some 4,700 full-time physicians.</p>
<p>JHU's bylaws specify a Board of Trustees of between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve six-year terms subject to a two-term limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the Board, except the President as an ex-officio trustee.  The Johns Hopkins Health System has a separate Board of Trustees, many of whom are doctors or health care executives. Some JHU Trustees also serve on the Johns Hopkins Health System Board.</p>
<p>In 2009, JHU ranked fifth among US universities in private fund-raising, collecting <a>$</a>433.39 million.</p>
<p>The President is JHU's chief executive officer, and the university is organized into nine academic divisions. with low transfer-in and a high graduate co-existence. The university is one of fourteen founding members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> (AAU); it is also a member of the <a>Consortium on Financing Higher Education</a> (COFHE) and the <a>Universities Research Association</a> (URA).</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Admissions</h3>
<p> <img> Admissions grew during the 2001-2010 decade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2007, 82% of admitted students graduated in the top tenth of their high school class and the inter-quartile range on the <a>SAT</a> reading was 660-760, math was 690-780, and writing was 670-760. 97% of freshmen returned after the first year, 84% of students graduated in 4 years and 91% graduated in 6 years. In 2010, Johns Hopkins ranked 13th in the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and 17th in the <a>QS World University Rankings</a>. Johns Hopkins also placed &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;2 in the 2010 University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP),  &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;3 in the 2010 <a>HEEACT &#x2013; Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities</a>, ranked &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;7 among Top Performing Schools according to the <em><a>Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index</a> (FSPI)</em> in 2008, and was listed &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;9 among research universities by the <em><a>Center for Measuring University Performance</a></em> in 2007. At the undergraduate level, Hopkins was ranked &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;13 among National Universities by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a> (USNWR)</em>.</p>
<p>For <a>medical</a> and <a>public health</a> research <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> ranked the <a>School of Medicine</a> &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;2 and has consistently ranked the <a>Bloomberg School of Public Health</a> &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;1 in the nation. The <a>School of Nursing</a> was ranked &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;4 nationally among peer institutions. The <em>Times Higher Education Supplement</em> ranked Johns Hopkins University &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;3 in the world for <a>biomedicine</a> and <a>life sciences</a>. Hopkins ranks &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;1 nationally in receipt of federal research funds and the School of Medicine is &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;1 among medical schools in receipt of extramural awards from the <a>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. Newsweek named Johns Hopkins as the &quot;Hottest School for Pre-meds&quot; in 2008. The <a>Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> was ranked as the top hospital in the United States for the eighteenth year in a row by the <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> annual ranking of American hospitals.</p>
<p>The university's graduate programs in the areas of <a>Biological</a> &amp; <a>Biomedical Sciences</a>, Engineering (<a>Biomedical</a>, <a>Electrical</a> &amp; <a>Environmental</a>), <a>Human Development</a> &amp; <a>Family Studies</a>, <a>Health Sciences</a>, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Physical</a> &amp; <a>Mathematical Sciences</a> and <a>International Affairs</a> &amp; <a>Development</a> all rank among the top-10 of their respective disciplines.</p>
<p>The <a>Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies</a> (SAIS) ranked #1 (2005), #2 (2007), and #2 (2009), by <a>College of William and Mary</a>'s surveys conducted once every two years beginning in 2005, for its MA program among the world's top schools of International Affairs for those who want to pursue a policy career.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Education</a> is ranked &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;6 nationally by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>. Although no formal rankings exist for <a>music conservatories</a>, the <a>Peabody Institute</a> is generally considered one of the most prestigious conservatories in the country, along with <a>Juilliard</a> and the <a>Curtis Institute</a>.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The Johns Hopkins University Library system houses more than 3.6 million volumes. It includes ten main divisions: the Sheridan Libraries at Homewood, the Medical Institutions Libraries, the School of Nursing Library, Abraham M. Lilienfeld Library at the Bloomberg School, the Peabody Institute Library, the Carey Business School and School of Education libraries, the School of Advanced International Studies Libraries (Sydney R. and Elsa W. Mason Library and Bologna Center Library), the R.E. Gibson Library at the Applied Physics Laboratory Library and other minor satellite locations, as well as the archives. [[File:JHU Eisenhower Library.jpg|300px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Milton S. Eisenhower Library]]&lt;/center&gt;]] The <a>Milton S. Eisenhower Library</a>, located on the <a>Homewood campus</a>, is the main library. It was built in the 1960s. It houses over 2.6 million volumes and over 20,000 journal subscriptions. The Eisenhower Library is a member of the university's Sheridan Libraries encompassing collections at the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room (called &quot;The Hut&quot; by students) in Gilman Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at Evergreen House, and the George Peabody Library at Mount Vernon Place. Together these collections provide the major research library resources for the university, serving Johns Hopkins academic programs worldwide. The library was named for <a>Milton S. Eisenhower</a>, former president of the university and brother of former U.S. president <a>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. JHU's library was originally housed in Gilman Hall, and the library stacks in that building continue to house certain collections.</p>
<p>Only two of the Eisenhower library's six stories are above ground, though architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The design accords with a bit of traditional campus lore which says no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building. There is no written rule regarding building height. In December 2008, it was announced that a new addition would be constructed directly to the south of the library. The six-and-a-half-story expansion will be named the Brody Learning Commons in honor of University President <a>William R. Brody</a> and will function as a &quot;collaborative learning space&quot;. It is scheduled to be completed by 2012.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The opportunity to participate in important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent research, most often alongside top researchers. In Fiscal Year 2009, Johns Hopkins received $1.856 billion in federal research grants, more than any other US university. JHU views its academic strengths as being in art history, biological, physical and other natural sciences, biomedical engineering, creative writing, English, history, economics, international studies, medicine, music, neuroscience, nursing, political theory, public health, public policy, and the <a>Romance languages</a>.</p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2009, Johns Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly 1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking &lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;3 globally behind <a>Harvard University</a> and <a>Max Planck Society</a> with the highest total citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in America. In Fiscal Year 2002, Hopkins became the first university to cross the $1 billion threshold on either list, recording $1.14 billion in total research and $1.023 billion in federally sponsored research. In Fiscal Year 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68 billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading U.S. academic institution in total R&amp;D spending for the 30th year in a row, according to a  <a>National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) ranking. Since 1979, these totals include $845 million of grants and expenditures of JHU's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.</p>

<h2>Johns Hopkins University Press</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously running <a>university press</a> in the <a>United States</a>. To date the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65 scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns Hopkins University Press has run <a>Project MUSE</a>, a large online collection of over 250 full-text, peer-reviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences. The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together, the three divisions of the Press - Books, Journals (including MUSE) and HFS - make it one of the largest of America's university presses.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>right|upright|thumb||300px|&lt;center&gt;Students gather under the holidays lights at the yearly Lighting of the Quad, a Hopkins tradition&lt;/center&gt;</a> The Johns Hopkins Student Government Association represents undergraduates in campus issues and projects.  It is elected annually. The blueprints for a new programming board called The Hopkins Organization for Programming (&quot;The HOP&quot;) were drawn up during the summer and fall of 2006.</p>
<p>In addition <a>Charles Village</a>, the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. <em>The Charles Village Project</em>, scheduled for completion in 2008, brought new commercial spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles Commons, a new, modern residence hall that includes popular retail franchises.</p>
<p>Hopkins invested in improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center; and a three-story sports facility, the O'Connor Recreation Center. The large on-campus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006.</p>
<p>Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic institutions, including <a>Loyola College</a>, <a>Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)</a>, <a>UMBC</a>, <a>Goucher College</a>, and <a>Towson University</a>, as well as <a>Inner Harbor</a>, nearby.</p>
<p>Annually, the Johns Hopkins Spring Fair is held on the Homewood campus over a three day weekend in mid to late April. Food, arts and crafts, and non-profit vendors, along with a popular musical act and various other activities attract nearly 25,000 people from the greater Baltimore-Washington area. The Spring Fair is the largest entirely student-run fair in the country.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p> <a>200px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Freshman Residence Hall at JHU&lt;/center&gt;</a> <a>300px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Johns Hopkins University Campus, Schematic&lt;/center&gt;</a> Living on campus is required for all freshmen and sophomores, with exceptions for commuter students who live close to campus. Juniors and seniors choose between entering the campus housing lottery or moving into nearby apartments or row houses. Housing is not guaranteed for all four years at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Freshmen housing is centered around Freshman Quad which consists of three major residence hall complexes: The Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II), Building A and Building B. AMR I was built in 1923 and includes Royce, Sylvester, Vincent, Willard, Wilson and Wood houses; AMR II in 1954, holding Adams, Baker, Clark, Gildersleeve, Griffin, Hollander, Jennings, Lazear houses. The houses were named for Hopkins Alumni who died in World Wars I and II. While each house has its own outside entrance, there are no dividers indoors that distinguish them. In 1983, Buildings A and B were added to Freshmen Quad. They have not yet been dedicated. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall on the other side of North Charles Street.</p>
<p>In the spring semester of their freshman year, students enter a housing lottery to determine where they will live during their sophomore year. They are housed in one of four buildings. The first, McCoy Hall is located next to Wolman Hall on North Charles Street. Apartment style housing is offered in the Bradford Apartments, one block east of campus on St. Paul Street, and in the Homewood Apartments, two blocks south.</p>
<p>The last, newest and largest university-owned dormitory is Charles Commons, located at the corner of North Charles and East 33rd. It was completed in 2006 to house 618 students and represented a major step by the university towards offering on-campus housing to students. Charles Commons consists of two 11-story towers connected by a bridge, suite-style living and features a ballroom, fitness center and several conference rooms. Nolan's on 33rd, a dining hall specializing in dinner services is also located in the building.</p>
<p>JHU rents several buildings on North Charles Street to house students when necessary. At full capacity, dormitory buildings can house approximately 60% of undergraduates. Privately-owned apartment buildings around Homewood are usually filled with Hopkins upperclassmen, so despite the lack of university-owned dormitories, housing is available.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and Sororities</h3>
<p>The University Office of Greek Life recognizes thirteen fraternities and eight sororities, which include approximately 20% of the student body. Greek life has been a part of the university culture since 1877, when <a>Beta Theta Pi</a> fraternity became the first to form a chapter on campus. Sororities arrived at Hopkins in 1982. As with all Hopkins programs, Greek discrimination on the basis of &quot;marital status, pregnancy, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status&quot; is prohibited. JHU also has an anti-hazing policy and prohibits alcohol at recruitment activities. Hopkins does not permit &quot;city-wide&quot; chapters, and requires all members of a JHU recognized fraternity or sorority to be a JHU student.</p>
<p>As of Spring 2010, 1,058 students were members of one of fraternities or sororities. The All-Greek Average <a>GPA</a> was 3.31, above the undergraduate average GPA. At that time the university was considering construction of a &quot;fraternity row&quot; of houses to consolidate the groups on campus.</p>
<p>All Johns Hopkins fraternities and sororities belong to one of four Councils: the <strong>Inter-Fraternity Council</strong>, the <strong><a>National Panhellenic Conference</a></strong>, the <strong><a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a></strong> and the <strong>Multicultural Council</strong>.</p>
<p>The Inter-Fraternity Council includes eleven fraternities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x0391;&#x0394;&#x03a6; - <a>Alpha Delta Phi</a> fraternity, <em>chapter founded 1889.</em></li>
  <li>&#x0391;&#x0395;&#x03a0; - <a>Alpha Epsilon Pi</a> fraternity, <em>Psi chapter founded 1936. Jewish interest.</em></li>
  <li>&#x0392;&#x0398;&#x03a0; - <a>Beta Theta Pi</a> fraternity, <em>Alpha Chi chapter founded 1877.</em></li>
  <li>&#x039b;&#x03a6;&#x0395; - <a>Lambda Phi Epsilon</a> fraternity, <em>Upsilon chapter founded 1994. Asian-American interest.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a6;&#x0394;&#x0398; - <a>Phi Delta Theta</a> fraternity, <em>Maryland Delta chapter founded 2008.</em></li>
  <li>FIJI - <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a> fraternity, <em>Beta Mu chapter founded 1891.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a6;&#x039a;&#x03a8; - <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a> fraternity, <em>Maryland Alpha chapter founded 1879.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a0;&#x039a;&#x0391; - <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a> fraternity, <em>Iota Tau chapter founded 1994.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a3;&#x0391;&#x0395; - <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity, <em>chapter founded 1994.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a3;&#x03a7; - <a>Sigma Chi</a> fraternity, <em>Kappa Upsilon chapter founded 2003.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a3;&#x03a6;&#x0395; - <a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a> fraternity, <em>Maryland Alpha chapter founded 1929.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The National Panhellenic Conference includes four sororities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x0391;&#x03a6; - <a>Alpha Phi</a> sorority, <em>Zeta Omicron chapter founded 1982.</em></li>
  <li>&#x039a;&#x039a;&#x0393; - <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a> sorority, <em>Eta Epsilon chapter founded 1999.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a6;M - <a>Phi Mu</a> sorority, <em>Gamma Tau chapter founded 1982.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a0;B&#x03a6; - <a>Pi Beta Phi</a> sorority, <em>Maryland Gamma colony will be chartered in November 2010.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The National Pan-Hellenic Council includes two historically African-American groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x0391;&#x03a6;&#x0391; - <a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a> fraternity, <em>Sigma Sigma chapter founded 1991.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a3;&#x0393;P - <a>Sigma Gamma Rho</a> sorority, <em>Rho Omega chapter founded 2009.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Multicultural Council</strong> includes four groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x03b1;&#x039a;&#x0394;&#x03a6; - <a>alpha Kappa Delta Phi</a> sorority, <em>associate chapter founded 1997. Asian-American interest.</em></li>
  <li>&#x0394;&#x039e;&#x03a6; - <a>Delta Xi Phi</a> sorority, <em>Lambda chapter founded 2003. Multicultural interest.</em></li>
  <li>IN&#x0394; - <a>Iota Nu Delta</a> fraternity, <em>chapter founded 2008. South Asian interest.</em></li>
  <li>&#x03a3;&#x039f;&#x03a0; - <a>Sigma Omicron Pi</a> sorority, <em>Lambda chapter founded 2002. Asian-American interest.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a>Delta Phi</a> Fraternity, also known as St. Elmo's, maintains a chapter exclusive to students at Johns Hopkins, though it is not recognized by the Office of Greek Life.</p>
<p>Unrecognized <a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> and <a>Delta Sigma Theta</a> African-American interest sororities often recruit Johns Hopkins undergraduates, in their city-wide chapters. <a>Delta Sigma Theta</a> was the first <strong>National Pan-Hellenic Council</strong> member to charter on the campus in 1976, as well as the first sorority of any kind on the JHU campus.</p>
<p><a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, a <a>National Panhellenic Conference</a> (NPC) sorority, was disbanded by its national headquarters on April 14, 2009 after twelve years on campus. The removal was due to risk management violations.</p>
<p>In March 2010, Johns Hopkins University officially opened for NPC extension. In May 2010, the University Panhellenic Council selected <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>, which opened in the fall of 2010.</p>
<p>Recruitment for Inter-Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Conference fraternities and sororities takes place during the spring semester for freshmen, though some groups recruit upperclassmen during the fall semester. All participants must have completed one semester and must be in good academic standing.</p>
<p>Many of the fraternities maintain houses off campus, but none of the sororities do.  Baltimore City allows housing to be zoned specifically for use as a fraternity or sorority house, but in practice this zoning code has not been awarded for at least 50 years. Only Sigma Phi Epsilon's building has this zoning code due to its consistent ownership since the 1920s.</p>
<h3>Student publications</h3>
<p>Hopkins has many studemt publications. </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><a>The Johns Hopkins News-Letter</a></em>, founded in 1896, is one of the oldest continuously published weekly college newspapers in the nation with a press run of 5,200. The News-Letter won a Associated Collegiate Press Newspaper Pacemaker award for four-year, non-daily college newspapers in 2007. </li>
  <li><em>The Hopkins Donkey</em> is a political newspaper with a <a>Democratic</a> perspective on international, national and state-wide political topics. </li>
  <li><em>The Carrollton Record</em> is a political newspaper with an <a>American conservative</a> perspective on campus and city-wide politics. </li>
  <li><em>Epidemic Proportions</em> is the university's public health research journal, designed to highlight JHU research and field work in public health. Combining research and scholarship, the journal seeks to capture the breadth and depth of the JHU undergraduate public health experience. </li>
  <li><em>Thoroughfare,</em> <em>Zeniada</em> and <em>j.mag</em> are literary magazines. <em>Prometheus</em> is the undergraduate philosophy journal.</li>
  <li><em>Frame of Reference</em> is an annual magazine that focuses on film and film culture. </li>
  <li><em>The New Diplomat</em> is the multi-disciplinary international relations journal. <em>Foundations</em> is the undergraduate history journal. </li>
  <li><em>Am&#x00e9;ricas</em> is the Latin American Studies journal. </pre>
<ul>
  <li><em>Argot</em> is the undergraduate anthropology journal. </li>
  <li><em>The Triple Helix</em> is the university's journal to address issues concerning science, law and society.</li>
  <li><em>Perspectives</em> is the official newsletter of the <em>Black Student Union</em>.</li>
  <li><em>The Black &amp; Blue Jay</em> is among the nation's oldest campus humor magazines. It was founded in 1920. According to <em>The Johns Hopkins News-Letter</em>, the magazine's name led the News-Letter to first use the moniker Blue Jays to refer to a Hopkins athletic team in 1923. While the magazine enjoyed popularity among students, it received repeated opposition from the university administration, reportedly for its vulgar humor. In October 1934, Dean Edward R. Berry removed financial support for the magazine; without funding, the magazine continued under the name <em>The Blue Jay</em> until Berry threatened to expel the editors in 1939. The magazine had a revival in 1984, and has published intermittently since then.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Athletics logo</a>  Athletic teams are called Blue Jays. Even though <a>sable</a> and <a>gold</a> are used for <a>academic robes</a>, the university's athletic colors are <a>Columbia blue</a> (PMS 284) and <a>black</a>. Hopkins celebrates <a>Homecoming</a> in the spring to coincide with the height of the <a>lacrosse</a> season. The Men's and Women's lacrosse teams are in <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) <a>Division I</a>. Other teams are in <a>Division III</a> and participate in the <a>Centennial Conference</a>. JHU is also home to the <a>Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame</a>, maintained by <a>US Lacrosse</a>.</p>
<h3>Men's lacrosse</h3>
<p> [[File:JHU 001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Johns Hopkins Men's Lacrosse at [[Homewood Field]].&lt;/center&gt;]] The school's most prominent team is its men's <a>lacrosse</a> team. The team does not belong to a conference. The team has won 44 national titles - nine Division I (2007, 2005, 1987, 1985, 1984, 1980, 1979, 1978, 1974), 29 <a>United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association</a> (<a>USILA</a>), and six Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA) titles.
