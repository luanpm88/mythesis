<p><strong>Shirley Ann Jackson</strong> (born August 5, 1946) is an <a>American</a> <a>physicist</a>, and the 18th president of <a>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. She received her <a>Ph.D.</a> in physics from the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 1973, becoming the first <a>African American</a> woman to earn a doctorate from MIT.</p>
<h2>Early life and schooling</h2>
<p>Jackson was born in Washington D.C.  Her parents, Beatrice and George Jackson, strongly valued education and encouraged her in school. Her father spurred on her interest in science by helping her with projects for her science classes. At Roosevelt High School, Jackson attended accelerated programs in both math and science, and graduated in 1964 as valedictorian.</p>
<h3>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</h3>
<p>On July 1, 1999, Jackson became the 18th president of <a>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. She was the first woman and first African-American to hold this position. Jackson is leading a strategic initiative called <a>The Rensselaer Plan</a> and much progress has been made towards achieving the Plan's goals. She has overseen a large capital improvement campaign, including the construction of an <a>Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center</a> and the East Campus Athletic Village. She enjoys the ongoing support of the RPI Board of Trustees. However, on April 26, 2006, the faculty of RPI (including a number of retirees) voted 155 to 149 against a vote of no-confidence in Jackson. In the Fall of 2007, the Rensselaer Board of Trustees suspended the faculty senate prompting a strong reaction from the Rensselaer community that resulted in various protests including a &quot;teach in.&quot;</p>
<p>Since arriving at RPI, Jackson has been one of the highest paid university presidents in the nation. Her combined salary and benefits has expanded from $423,150 in 1999-2000 to over $1.3 million in 2006-07.  In 2006-07 it is estimated she received another $1.3 million from board seats at several major corporations. In its 2009 review of the decade 1999-2009, McClatchy Newspapers reported Jackson as the highest-paid currently sitting college president in the U.S., with a 2008 salary of approximately $1.6 million. On December 4-5, 2009 Jackson celebrated her 10th year at RPI with an extravagant &quot;Celebration Weekend&quot;, which featured tribute concerts by <a>Aretha Franklin</a> and <a>Joshua Bell</a> among other events. Following the weekend, the Board of Trustees announced they would support construction of a new guest house on Dr. Jackson's property, for the purpose of &quot;[enabling] the president to receive and entertain, appropriately, Rensselaer constituents, donors, and other high-level visitors&quot;. It was later revealed that Dr. Jackson's current house on Tibbits Ave has  of space, seven bedrooms and five bathrooms, and an estimated value of $1,122,500. The trustees claimed that &quot;the funds for this new project would not have been available for any other purpose&quot; A new plan was announced on February 25, describing how the President's house will be replaced with new two-story high house. The new house will have &quot;9,600 square feet of livable space, divided approximately equally between living space for the president's family and rooms for the president to conduct meetings and events.&quot; In June of 2010, it was discovered that newest plans for the house showed a new size of , causing the city of Troy to issue a Stop Work Order until additional building fees were paid. </p>
<p>In June of 2010, it was announced that the Rensselaer Board of Trustees unanimously voted to extend Jackson a ten-year contract renewal, which she accepted. </p>
<h2>Honors and distinctions</h2>
<p>Jackson has received many fellowships, including the <a>Martin Marietta</a> Aircraft Company Scholarship and Fellowship, the <a>Prince Hall Masons Scholarship</a>, the <a>National Science Foundation</a> Traineeship, and a <a>Ford Foundation</a> Advanced Study Fellowship. She has been elected to numerous special societies, including the <a>American Physical Society</a> and <a>American Philosophical Society</a>.</p>
<p>Her achievements in science and education have been recognized with multiple awards, including the CIBA-GEIGY Exceptional Black Scientist Award.  In the early 1990s, Governor James Florio awarded her the Thomas Alva Edison Science Award for her contributions to physics and for the promotion of science. She has also received many honorary doctorate degrees.   </p>
<p>She was inducted into  National Women's Hall of Fame in 1998 for &quot;her significant contributions as a distinguished scientist and advocate for education, science, and public policy&quot;. More recently she was named one of the 50 Most Important Women in Science by <a>Discover magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Jackson has also been active in professional associations and in serving society through public scientific commissions.  In 1985, Governor Thomas Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology.  She is an active voice in numerous committees of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a>American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> (AAAS), and the <a>National Science Foundation</a>. Her continuing aim has been to preserve and strengthen the U.S. national capacity for innovation by increasing support for basic research in science and engineering. This is done in part by attracting talent from abroad and by expanding the domestic talent pool by attracting women and members of under-represented groups into careers in science. In 2004 she became president of the <a>American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> and chaired the AAAS board in 2005.</p>
<p>In spring 2007 she was awarded the <a>Vannevar Bush Award</a> for &quot;a lifetime of achievements in scientific research, education and senior statesman-like contributions to public policy.&quot; </p>
<p>Dr. Jackson continues to be involved in politics and public policy. In 2008 she became the University Vice Chairman of the U.S. <a>Council on Competitiveness</a>, a non-for profit group based in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>. In 2009, President Obama appointed Dr. Jackson to serve on the <a>President&#x2019;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology</a>, a 20 member advisory group dedicated to public policy. </p>
