<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wichita State University began as <strong>Fairmount College</strong>, a private <a>Congregational</a> school, in 1886 by the Rev. Joseph Homer Parker. The college continued the preparatory program of Fairmount Institute, which started in 1892. Collegiate classes began in 1895. In 1926, by a vote of the citizens of Wichita, the college became a public non-denominational institution named the <strong>Municipal University of Wichita</strong> (popularly known as &quot;Wichita&quot; or &quot;WU&quot;); it was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi.  </p>
<p>After 38 years as a municipal university, WSU changed its status on July 1, 1964, when it officially entered the state system of higher education. Wichita State University is one the three research institutions in Kansas, along with the University of Kansas and Kansas State University.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Wichita, Kansas.JPG|thumb|right|[[Charles Koch Arena]] at Wichita State University, is home to the <a>Wichita State Shockers</a> men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams.]] </p>
<p>WSU is an <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> institution and fields teams in tennis, cross-country, basketball, track, golf, crew, bowling, men's baseball and women's volleyball and softball.  The men's <a>baseball</a> team is <a>college baseball</a>'s highest winning team for the past 31 years, with numerous conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances. The baseball team won the national championship in 1989 and was runner-up in 1982, 1991 and 1993. They play at <a>Eck Stadium</a>. The <a>men's basketball team</a> reached the Final Four in 1965, the Elite Eight in 1981 and the Sweet Sixteen in 2006.  The men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s bowling teams have won numerous USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships [<a>http://bowl.com/tournaments/usbcitc/</a>], including the men&#x2019;s 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 title and the women's 2005, 2007 and 2009 title.</p>
<p>The school discontinued its <a>football</a> program following the 1986 season due to poor attendance, financial red ink, NCAA recruiting violations, and the state of disrepair of <a>Cessna Stadium</a>. Legendary <a>NFL</a> coach <a>Bill Parcells</a> was a linebacker at WSU in 1962 and 1963 before serving as a graduate assistant in 1964. Wichita State University was also the first Division 1-A school to hire a black head coach in <a>College Football</a>, <a>Willie Jeffries</a> in 1979.</p>
<h3>Shockers</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right</a> The name for WSU's athletic teams is the Shockers and, collectively, students are also referred to as being &quot;Shockers&quot;. The name reflects the University's heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers. [<a>http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp</a>] Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol.  WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. Elsea, who had been a Marine during World War II, decided that &quot;the school needed a mascot who gave a tough impression, with a serious, no-nonsense scowl.&quot; </p>
<p>Once Elsea's mascot was adopted by the university, which by that time was known as the Municipal University of Wichita, all that was needed was a name. The Oct. 7, 1948, issue of The Sunflower, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. It was freshman Jack Kersting who suggested the winning name, &quot;WuShock.&quot; </p>
<p>In 1998, WuShock, also referred to as &quot;Wu,&quot; marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help.  Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.</p>
<h3>Football team plane crash</h3>
<p> On October 2, 1970, the first, or &quot;gold&quot; plane (the twin plane to the second, or black, plane) carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a <a>Colorado</a> airport after refueling, bound for <a>Logan, Utah</a>, for a game against <a>Utah State University</a>. It flew into a mountain valley too narrow to enable it to turn back and smashed into a mountainside, killing 31 of the 40 players, administrators and fans near a ski resort  away from <a>Denver</a>. President <a>Richard Nixon</a> sent the president of the university a note which read, &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to you in this time of sorrow.&quot;</p>
<h2>Aerospace Engineering</h2>
<p>The department was founded in 1928, the department of aerospace engineering has a long history of academic excellence, scholarship, and commitment to community. Located in the &quot;Air Capital of the World,&quot; students and faculty benefit from Wichita's rich aviation heritage and close proximity to major aircraft companies. It has longstanding collaborative relationships with <a>Airbus North America</a>, <a>Boeing</a>, <a>Bombardier-Learjet</a>, <a>Cessna</a>, <a>Hawker Beechcraft</a>, <a>Spirit AeroSystems</a>, and other <a>Wichita</a> <a>aviation</a> concerns.</p>
<p>The Cooperative Education Program facilitates placements for students while they are in school. Outstanding students work as Co-Ops or Interns locally and at <a>NASA</a> (including the Johnson Space and Dryden Flight Research Centers).</p>
<p><a>National Science Foundation</a> and <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> statistics, for fiscal year 2006, ranked Wichita State University as Top 3 among all U.S. universities in money spent on aerospace research and development, with more than $19 million in expenditures. That's an improvement from the previous year's fourth-place ranking, and it places WSU in the company of <a>Johns Hopkins University</a> and the <a>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, which were first and second, respectively. While ranking higher than <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>MIT</a> and <a>Stanford University</a>. WSU faculty, staff, and students participate in this research. Wichita State University is also among the few institution granting a doctorate degree in <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> which is of global repute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The department teaches in the areas of composites, structures, <a>Engineering mechanics</a>, computational <a>Fluid dynamics</a>, applied <a>Aerodynamics</a>, and <a>Flight simulation</a>.  Related facilities, in the Aerospace Engineering department and the <a>National Institute for Aviation Research</a> (NIAR), provide students an opportunity to experience the use of aerospace design tools.</p>
