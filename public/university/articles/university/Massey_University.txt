<h2>Massey University School of Aviation</h2>
<p>Massey University School of Aviation is an educational institute which forms part of the College of Business. It provides flight instruction together with a university degree to prospective airplane pilots (i.e. fixed wing professional pilots) as well as a degree in aviation management to those students who want to work in other areas of aviation. The School of Aviation also caters for postgraduate education with a postgraduate diploma, masters and PhD.</p>
<h3>2006 mid-air collision</h3>
<p>On 9 February 2006, two students at the School - Brandon James Gedge, 20, from Tauranga, and Dae Jin Hwang, 27, from West Auckland - both flying <a>Piper Warrior II</a> (PA-28-161) trainer aircraft, registrations ZK-MBD and ZK-MBL, were killed in a <a>mid-air collision</a> over Opiki, 18&nbsp;km southwest of Palmerston North, at 9:47&nbsp;am. The aircraft crashed on to farm land, spreading debris over a 500 square metre area. The <a>CAA</a> found the accident's cause was neither pilot seeing the other aircraft due to blind spots in both aircraft, with one climbing directly towards the sun. The <a>Square Trust Rescue Helicopter</a> was forced to take evasive action several minutes before the collision, when one of the accident aircraft turned into its path. As a result of the accident, special procedures were set up in the Southern Training Area airspace south of Palmerston North.</p>
