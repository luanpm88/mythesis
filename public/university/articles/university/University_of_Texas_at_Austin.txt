<p><strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong> (also referred to as the <strong>University of Texas</strong>, <strong>UT</strong>, <strong>UT Austin</strong>, or <strong>Texas</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Austin</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>, and is the <a>flagship</a> institution of <a>The University of Texas System</a>. The main campus is located approximately  from the <a>Texas State Capitol</a>.  Founded in 1883, the university has the <a>fifth-largest</a> single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2009 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff. It currently holds the <a>largest enrollment</a> of all colleges in the state of Texas.</p>
<p>The University of Texas at Austin was named one of the original eight <a>Public Ivy</a> institutions and was inducted into the <a>American Association of Universities</a> in 1929.  The university is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $640 million for the 2009-2010 school year. The University of Texas at Austin operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, including the <a>J. J. Pickle Research Campus</a>.  In addition, the university was recognized by <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in 2002.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>The first mention of a public university in <a>Texas</a> can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the <a>Mexican</a> state of <a>Coahuila y Tejas</a>. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the Mexican government. But after Texas obtained its <a>independence</a> from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the <a>Constitution of the Republic</a>, which included a provision to establish public education in the <a>republic</a>, including two universities or colleges. On January 26, 1839, the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty <a>league</a>s of land towards the effort; in addition,  in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1846, Texas was <a>annexed</a> into the <a>United States</a>. The state legislature passed the Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States <a>bonds</a> towards construction of a university. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's <a>secession</a> from the Union and the <a>American Civil War</a> prevented further action on these plans. <a>right|thumbnail|The university's Old Main Building in 1903</a></p>
<p>After the war, the 1862 <a>Morrill Act</a> facilitated the creation of what is now <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas. Following the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of <a>suicide</a> jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public.</p>
<p>Completed in 1969, Jester Center was the largest residence hall in North America and was the largest building project in university history. It includes two towers, which include 14-level and 10-level residences with a capacity of 3,200.</p>
<p>The first <a>presidential library</a> on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former <a>President Johnson</a>, <a>Lady Bird Johnson</a> and then-President <a>Richard Nixon</a> in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the <a>Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum</a> is one of 12 presidential libraries administered by the <a>National Archives and Records Administration</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Colton Pitonyak, a junior at the university, shot and killed 21-year-old Jennifer Cave in Pitonyak&#x2019;s apartment in <a>West Campus</a>. Pitonyak was convicted and is serving a 55-year sentence for murder. Author and Texas resident <a>Kathryn Casey</a>'s ensuing book, <em>A Descent into Hell</em>, chronicles the case.</p>
<p>The University of Texas has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened a new  facility named the Blanton Museum of Art. The museum, the largest university art museum in the United States, is home to more than 17,000 works from <a>Europe</a>, the <a>United States</a> and <a>Latin America</a>. In August 2008, the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center opened for conferences, seminars and continuing education and executive-education programs. The hotel and conference center are part of a new gateway to the university extending the South Mall. Later the same month, after three years of renovations were completed, <a>Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium</a> became the largest stadium (by seating capacity) in the state of Texas. In addition to numerous improvements, DKR now seats 100,119, up from the previous 94,113. In 2009, demolition of the old Experimental Sciences Building (ESB) was completed and construction began on a replacement to be named the Norman Hackerman Building (NHB) in honor and memory of Dr. Norman Hackerman, chemist, professor and president emeritus.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 28, 2010, 19-year-old sophomore Colton Tooley opened fire on 21st Street between Guadalupe and Speedway with a semi-automatic copy of an <a>AK-47</a>. He then walked into the Perry-Casta&#x00f1;eda Library, ascended the staircase to the 6th floor, and took his own life through a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The initial gunfire led to a full lockdown of the university campus within minutes. Searches for a potential second shooter, prompted by varying descriptions of the gunman, eventually ceased and the lockdown was lifted around noon.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The university's property totals , comprising the  for the main campus and other land for the <a>J. J. Pickle Research Campus</a> in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totalling over . <a>thumb|right|Battle Hall</a> <a>thumb|right|Flawn Academic Center and UT Tower at night</a> One of the university's most visible features is the <a>Beaux-Arts</a> <a>Main Building</a>, including a  tower designed by <a>Paul Philippe Cret</a>. Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; it is conversely darkened for solemn occasions. At the top of the tower is a <a>carillon</a> of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by resident carillonneur Tom Anderson, in addition to the usual pealing of <a>Westminster Quarters</a> every quarter hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours. [[Image:Littlefield house 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Littlefield House]], used today by the university's Office of Resource Development, was constructed in 1893 and is listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.]] The university is home to 7 museums and 17 libraries, which hold over eight million volumes. The holdings of the university's <a>Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center</a> include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the <a>Gutenberg Bible</a> and the first permanent photograph, </em><a>View from the Window at Le Gras</a><em>, taken by <a>Nic&#x00e9;phore Ni&#x00e9;pce</a>. The newest museum, the <a>Blanton Museum of Art</a>, opened in April 2006 and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America.</p>
<p>The University of Texas has an extensive underground <a>tunnel</a> system that links all of the buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s under the supervision of creator Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the university campus. They currently measure approximately six miles in total length. The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and is guarded by <a>silent alarms</a>. Since the late 1940s the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a 1.1 megawatt <a>TRIGA</a> nuclear reactor at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus.</em></p>
<p>The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium, and in March 2006 the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Center next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to <em>The Daily Texan</em>, the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.</p>
<p>The university operates a public radio station, <a>KUT</a>, which provides local <a>FM broadcasts</a> as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses <a>Capital Metro</a> to provide bus transportation for students around the campus and throughout Austin.</p>
<h2>Academic profile</h2>
<p>[[Image:UTAustin business.jpg|left|thumb|[[McCombs School of Business]]]]&lt;br /&gt;  [[Image:UT Austin Mustangs campus.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alexander Phimister Proctor|Proctor's]] <em>Mustangs</em> (1948) overlooking the <a>Engineering Sciences buildings</a>]] UT Austin is consistently ranked as one of the top public universities in the country, with highly-regarded programs in a variety of fields. Nationally, the university ranked 45th according to <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, 13th among public universities in 2010.  The <a>McCombs School of Business</a> was ranked seventh among undergraduate business programs in 2010, and the <a>Cockrell School of Engineering</a> was ranked ninth among undergraduate engineering programs in 2009.  Internationally, UT Austin was ranked 70th in the &quot;World's Best Universities&quot; ranking presented by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, and ranked 38th in the world by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, based on factors such as Nobel laureate affiliation and number of highly-cited researchers.  In 2009, <a>The Economist</a> ranked the school 49th worldwide. In 2010, <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the university 67th in the world.</p>
<p>As of 2010, <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> ranked forty-three UT graduate programs and specialties in the top ten nationally, and another fifty-three others ranked in the top 25.  Among these programs include the fourth-ranked College of Pharmacy, the ninth-ranked Cockrell School of Engineering, the tenth-ranked College of Education, and the 15th-ranked <a>School of Law</a>.  Four UT graduate programs were ranked first in the nation, including Accounting and Petroleum Engineering. A 2005 <a>Bloomberg</a> survey ranked the school 5th among all business schools and first among public business schools for the largest number of alumni who are <a>S&amp;P 500</a> <a>CEO</a>s. Similarly, a 2005 <em><a>USA Today</a></em> report ranked the university as &quot;the number one source of new <a>Fortune 1000</a> CEOs.&quot;</p>
<h3>Colleges and schools</h3>
<p>The university contains sixteen colleges &amp; schools and two academic units, each listed with its founding date:</em> &lt;!-- Please keep list below in alphabetical order. --&gt; </p>
<p>The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2008-2009 academic year, the university awarded a total of 12,861 degrees: 67.0% <a>bachelor's degree</a>s, 22.6% <a>master's degree</a>s, 6.0% <a>doctoral degree</a>s, and 4.4% Special Professional degrees.</em></p>
<p>The university has six honors programs that span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Sciences, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Honors Program in Natural Sciences, and the interdisciplinary Plan II Honors program.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>[[Image:TMM austin.JPG|left|thumb|Relief sculpture in the [[Texas Memorial Museum]]]] As a state public university, the University of Texas at Austin is subject to <a>Texas House Bill 588</a>, which guarantees graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university; however, students in the top 10% are not guaranteed their choice of major, and certain colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.  In 2009, over 85% of enrolled students from Texas were admitted under this law.  A new state law, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature which modifies this admissions policy by limiting automatically-admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011.  The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university expects to automatically admit students in the top 8% of their graduating class for 2011.</p>
<p>For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed &quot;more selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. For Fall 2009, 31,362 applied and 45.6% were accepted, and of those accepted, 51.0% enrolled.  The university's freshman retention rate in 2009 was 92.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 81.0%.</p>
<h3>Faculty and research</h3>
<p> In Fall 2009, the school employed 2,770 <a>full-time</a> faculty members (88.3% of whom hold the terminal degree in their field), with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17.3 to 1. winners of the <a>Nobel Prize</a>, the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>, the <a>National Medal of Science</a>, the <a>National Medal of Technology</a>, the <a>Turing Award</a> and other various awards.  Nine Nobel Laureates are or have been affiliated with UT Austin.</p>
<p>Except for <a>MIT</a>, UT Austin attracts more federal research grants than any American university without a medical school.  UT Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a <a>technology transfer</a> center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development.  In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years.  UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009. and is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science.  Energy is a major research thrust of the university, with major federally-funded projects on biofuels, battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, among others.  In 2009, UT founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science <a>Raymond L. Orbach</a>, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research at the university.  While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience, and others.  UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute in 2010 as part of an effort to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in the city of Austin.</p>
<p>UT Austin operates several major auxiliary research centers.  The world's third-largest telescope, the <a>Hobby-Eberly Telescope</a>, and three other large telescopes are part of UT's <a>McDonald Observatory</a>, located  west of Austin.  The university manages nearly  of biological field laboratories, including the <a>Brackenridge Field Laboratory</a> in Austin.  The <a>J.J. Pickle Research Campus</a> (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, as well as the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a  cleanroom for device fabrication.  Founded in 1946, UT's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has been responsible for the development or testing of the vast majority of high-frequency sonar equipment used by the Navy, and in 2007, was granted a research contract by the Navy funded up to $928 million over ten years.</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p> The university has an endowment of $7.2 billion, out of the $16.11 billion (according to 2008 estimates) available to the University of Texas. This figure reflects the fact that the school has the largest endowment of any public university in the nation.</p>
<p>[[Image:View austin campus.JPG|thumb|right|View of [[Texas State Capitol]] in downtown Austin from Main Mall, south of the <a>Main Building</a>]]</p>
<p>30% of the university's endowment comes from <a>Permanent University Fund</a> (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007. Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.</p>
<p>The university is one of only two public universities in the U.S. that have a triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies, along with the <a>University of Virginia</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student profile</h3>
<p>For Fall 2010, the university enrolled 38,420 undergraduate, 11,582 graduate and 1,680 law and pharmacy students.  Out-of-state and international students comprised 8.5% of the undergraduate student body and 19.7% of the total student body, with students from all 50 states and more than 120 foreign countries&#x2014;most notably, <a>South Korea</a>, followed by <a>India</a>, the <a>People's Republic of China</a>, <a>Mexico</a> and <a>Taiwan</a>. <a>Jester Center</a> is the largest residence hall with its capacity of 2,945.  Academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, <a>housing cooperative</a>s, apartments, or with <a>Greek organization</a>s and other off-campus residences. The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds in the near future.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>The university recognizes more than 1,000 student organizations. In addition, it supports three official student governance organizations that represent student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. Student Government, established in 1902, is the oldest governance organization and represents student interests in general. The Senate of College Councils represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils, and the Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests. The University Unions Student Events Center serves as the hub for student activities on campus. The <a>Friar Society</a> serves as the oldest honor society at the university. The <a>Texas 4000 for Cancer</a> student organization is the longest annual charity bicycle ride in the world and has raised over $1.4 million dollars for cancer research from its founding in 2004 to April, 2009.</em></p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p> The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. The first Greek chapter on campus was the Texas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta and was founded on October 15, 1883, less than a month after the opening of the University. Approximately 11 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or sororities. Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization. According to the Office of the Dean of Students' mission statement, Greek Life promotes the principles of cultural appreciation, scholarship, leadership, and <a>service</a>. Only the Kappa Kappa Gamma and Alpha Phi <a>fraternity and sorority houses</a> are located on campus; the majority of Greek houses are located west of the <a>Drag</a> in the neighborhood called <a>West Campus</a>.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p> Students express their opinions in and outside of class through periodicals including <em><a>Study Breaks Magazine</a></em>, <em><a>The Daily Texan</a></em> (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States), and the <em><a>Texas Travesty</a></em>. Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through <a>K09VR</a> and <a>KVRX</a>.</p>
<p>The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the university's Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts <em>the Blogora</em>, a <a>blog</a> for &quot;connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and rhetoricians with public life&quot; by the <a>Rhetoric Society of America</a>.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>[[Image:Texas Longhorn.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas longhorn]] serves as the university <a>mascot</a>.]] Traditions at the University of Texas are perpetuated through several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students frequently sing &quot;<a>Texas Fight</a>&quot;, the university's fight song while displaying the <a>Hook 'em Horns</a> hand gesture&#x2014;the gesture mimicking the horns of the school's mascot, <a>Bevo</a> the <a>Texas longhorn</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right|thumb|Texas Longhorns logo</a></p>
<p>The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. As of 2008, the university's athletics program ranked fifth in the nation among <a>Division I</a> schools, according to the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a>. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in a 2002 analysis performed by <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a>.</em> Texas was also listed as the number one <a>Collegiate Licensing Company</a> client for the second consecutive year in regards to the amount of annual <a>trademark royalties</a> received from the sales of its fan merchandise. However, this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company, which does not handle licensing for approximately three dozen large schools including <a>Ohio State</a>, <a>USC</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>Michigan State</a>, and <a>Texas A&amp;M</a>.</p>
<h3>Varsity sports</h3>
<p>The University's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. A charter member of the <a>Southwest Conference</a> until its dissolution in 1996, Texas now competes in the <a>Big 12 Conference</a> (South Division) of the <a>NCAA's Division I-FBS</a>. Texas has won 47 total national championships, 39 of which are NCAA national championships.</p>
<p>The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a <a>college football</a> powerhouse.  At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage. The team experienced its greatest success under coach <a>Darrell Royal</a>, winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970. It won a fourth title under head coach <a>Mack Brown</a> in 2005 after a 41-38 victory over previously undefeated <a>Southern California</a> in the <a>2006 Rose Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, the men's <a>basketball</a> team has gained prominence, advancing to the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the <a>Elite Eight</a> in 2006 and 2008.</p>
<p>The University's <a>baseball</a> team is considered to be one of the best in the nation with more trips to the <a>College World Series</a> (33) than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002 and 2005.</p>
<p>Additionally, the University's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles. The swim team was first developed under Coach <a>Tex Robertson</a>. In particular, the men's team is under the leadership of <a>Eddie Reese</a>, who served as the head men's coach at the <a>1992 Summer Olympics</a> in <a>Barcelona</a>, the <a>2004 Games</a> in <a>Athens</a> and the <a>2008 Games</a> in <a>Beijing</a>. [[Image:Texas entry 2007 Red River Shootout.jpg|right|thumb|Texas entry in the 2007 [[Red River Shootout]]]]</p>
<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p>The Longhorns have a rivalry in all sports with the <a>Texas A&amp;M Aggies</a>. The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the <a>State Farm Lone Star Showdown</a> series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The Longhorns lead the &quot;showdown,&quot; 75-36-5. The game is traditionally played on <a>Thanksgiving</a> day. Both schools hold a rally before the annual football game &mdash; Texas hosts the <a>Hex Rally</a>, and students at Texas A&amp;M host the <a>Aggie Bonfire</a> (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&amp;M event after the deaths of 12 students in 1999).</p>
<p>The Longhorns also have a long standing football rivalry with the <a>Oklahoma Sooners</a> and hold a 59-41-5 edge in that series. Since 1932, the teams have played annually at the <a>Cotton Bowl</a> in Dallas, Texas, in the <a>Red River Rivalry</a> game. The rivalry has grown in recent years, as the winner has gone to the Big 12 Conference championship and BCS National championship games.</p>
<p>Other schools, such as <a>University of Arkansas</a> and <a>Texas Tech</a>, also count Texas among their rivals; however, each of these schools also trail Texas by significant margins in overall series records, 56-21-0 and 45-15-0, respectively.</p>
