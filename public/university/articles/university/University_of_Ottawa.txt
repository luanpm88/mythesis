The enabling legislation is <em>The University of Ottawa Act, 1965.</em>  The University of Ottawa is ranked 5th in research-intensity, and 9th in total-<a>research funding</a> in Canada. It is a member of the <a>Group of Thirteen</a>, a league of the most research-intensive universities in the country.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Tabaret Hall with the Desmarais Building in the background</a></p>
<p>The University of Ottawa is a bilingual institution founded in 1848 as the Roman Catholic College of Bytown by <a>Monseigneur</a> <a>Joseph-Bruno Guigues</a>, <a>OMI</a>. The college was originally for boys only and taught a classical liberal arts curriculum.  Morning classes were taught in French and afternoon classes in English.</p>
<p>The campus was originally located in the <a>Lower Town</a> district of the city of <a>Bytown</a> on the site of what is now the <a>Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica</a>.  One of the original buildings still stands at the intersection of Sussex Drive and Guigues Avenue.  The college moved to its current location in <a>Sandy Hill</a> in 1856 when land was donated by notary Louis T. Besserer.  In 1866 the college received a <a>Royal charter</a> from London, England to become the University of Ottawa.  In 1889, the University of Ottawa was granted a <a>pontifical charter</a> by <a>Pope Leo XIII</a>.  The pontifical charter would later be transferred to <a>Saint Paul University</a> during a reorganization in 1965.  Academic Hall was completed in 1901  The Main Academic Building was rebuilt in various stages from 1905 to 1931.  The design for the new building was inspired by the <a>Capitol Building</a> in <a>Washington</a> by architect A. O. Von Herbulis.  The building was renamed in 1971 to Tabaret Hall in honour of <a>Father</a> Joseph-Henri Tabaret, OMI.</p>
<p>In 1935, the Catholic Centre was organized at the University of Ottawa. In 1939 the Canadian Officers' Training Corps and the <a>Royal Canadian Air Force</a> began using some of the university's facilities.  In 1942, temporary military barracks were constructed on campus for the <a>Canadian Women's Army Corps</a>.  A total of 1158 students and alumni enlisted in the war effort.</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa was restructured and made non-denominational in 1965. The Ontario legislature passed the University of Ottawa Act in 1965, making the university a provincially funded institution.  <a>Saint Paul University</a> was founded at this time and the university's theology programs were transferred. University vice-president and provost Francois Houle had previously sent Coulter an email warning that <a>hate speech</a> could lead to <a>criminal charges</a>. Coulter criticised the university for intimidation, accusing Houle of &quot;promoting hatred against [...] <a>conservatives</a>&quot;,</p>

In the 2007 rankings, the university placed 87th out of the top 90 EMBA programs.</p>
<p>The <a>Corporate Knights</a> magazine 2005 survey of business schools ranked the university&#x2019;s undergraduate program 4th in Canada. In the 2007 survey of business and law rankings, the undergraduate business program placed 10th, and the University of Ottawa's <a>Common Law</a> program was ranked 1st in Canada.  The rankings use additional components of social and environmental impact management infused into their curricula.</p>
<p>In the <a>THES - QS World University Rankings</a> of the top 500 universities in the world for 2009, the University of Ottawa placed 226th, and 13th overall in Canada [[File:Desmarais Building.JPG|thumb|left|Desmarais Building, the university's newest building in [[2007]]]] The 2008 international table &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; produced by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> rated University of Ottawa in the 7-18 bracket nationally, and in the top 201-302 of 500 universities in the world.</p>
<p>In 2005, the School of Management was featured in the <a>Princeton Review</a>&#x2019;s Best 143 Business Schools Worldwide, which produces test preparation, such as the SAT's and information regarding college admissions.</p>
<p>In 1981 and 1982 Martin LaPlante and Michael McCulloch of the university were finalists in the <a>World Universities Debating Championship</a>. Finally in 2005, the University of Ottawa won the World Universities Debating Championship by defeating the participants <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>University of Oxford</a> and <a>University of Toronto</a> in the final. The contestants representing the university were Jamie Furniss and Erik Eastaugh.</p>
<p>The <a>Maclean's</a> 2010 university ranking guide, that takes a measure of the &quot;<a>undergraduate</a> experience&quot;, ranked the school 11th in the Medical Doctoral peer grouping.</p>
<p>Maclean's also published their first <a>Law School</a> rankings in 2007, which the university placed 1st in <em>National Reach</em>, 3rd in <em>Supreme Court Clerkships</em>, and 4th <em>Overall</em> in Canada for their Common Law Program.  In the Civil Law Program, the school placed 1st in <em>National Reach</em>, 1st in <em>Supreme Court Clerkships</em>, and 2nd <em>Overall</em>.</p>
<p>In August 2006, the University of Ottawa announced, along with 10 other Canadian universities, that it disagreed with the ranking of Canadian universities as put forth by <a>Maclean's</a> magazine.  The universities will be in a sense boycotting their rankings by refusing to participate in future surveys by the magazine. The reason for the <a>boycott</a> is that the university disagrees with the methodology used in reaching the ranking.</p>

<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>The <a>Student Federation of the University of Ottawa</a> (SFUO) claims to represent undegraduate students of the university, while the <a>Graduate Students' Association des &#x00e9;tudiant.e.s dipl&#x00f4;m&#x00e9;.e.s</a> (GSA&#x00c9;D) claims to represent its graduate students.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2008, the university presented a draft version of a Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct. Students held a rally in opposition of the proposed code, with representatives from the two student associations stating that it had the potential to stifle student dissent and the rights of students for free speech with respect to university affairs. Around 3000 out of 43000 students signed a petition against the code of conduct and hundreds participated in the April 25 rally. As of August 2008, the university announced the draft code has been abandoned in favour of a &quot;different solution that will be created and agreed upon by all members of the university community, including students, professors, staff and the University administration&quot;.</p>
<p>The solution adopted by the University of Ottawa to replace the non-academic student code of conduct was announced on December 4, 2008 with the launch of a web site outlining a new Declaration of Rights for members of the University community.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>There are two weekly newspapers published by students, the <em><a>Fulcrum</a></em> in English and <em><a>La Rotonde</a></em> in French. There also exists a bilingual video production house called Zoom Productions and a <a>campus radio</a> station, <a>CHUO</a> where actor/comedian <a>Tom Green</a> and model/MTV VJ <a>Quddus</a> both hosted late-night shows at different times for several years. Currently noted academic activist and former University of Ottawa professor <a>Denis Rancourt</a> is also the host of Thursday night program at CHUO.  The Undergraduate English Students' Association publishes the arts and literary journal Ottawa Arts Review.</p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p>On-campus residences are situated in downtown Ottawa. With a capacity to house over 3000 full-time students, UofO has seven residence buildings: four traditional-style buildings: Thompson, Stanton, Marchand, and Leblanc, the dormitory/apartment hybrid 90 University (opened in 2002), and two apartment-style buildings: Brooks and Hyman-Soloway (opened in 2005). At uOttawa all first year undergraduate students are guaranteed a place in residence.</p>
<p>The main residential complex (including 90 University, Stanton, and Marchand) is open during the summer as a hotel to independent travellers, conference attendees, school groups, and others. Additionally, the 20th floor of 90 University is open year-round as a short-term hotel, catering particularly to visiting professors and researchers.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Ottawa Gee-Gees logo</a>  The university is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the <a>Ottawa Gee-Gees</a>. The University of Ottawa competes in basketball, ice hockey, Canadian football, rugby, soccer, swimming, volleyball, and track and field.</p>
<p>The Gee-Gees football team won the national championship, the Vanier Cup, in 1975 and 2000 and also appeared in the championship game in 1970, 1980, and 1997. In 2010 the Gee-Gees quaterback, Brad Sinopoli, won the Hec Crighton Award for the CIS Most Outstanding Player. Brad had 2756 passing yards, 22 TDs, 13 INTs, and a pass completion rating of 61.1%.</p>
<p>Prior to adopting the current mascot, students used the university's colours, garnet and grey, to refer to the school's sports teams. The abbreviation of the two colors, GG, eventually developed into the Gee-Gee mascot used today. A <strong>gee-gee</strong> is a lead racehorse.</p>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
<p>The University joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret'd) <a>Rick Hillier</a>, for the families of fallen <a>Canadian Forces</a> members.</p>
<h2>Bilingualism</h2>
<p>In 1848, the institution &#x2014; then called Bytown College &#x2014; brought together Francophone and Anglophone students. From the outset, the college&#x2019;s founders, the Oblates, believed that their institution should promote reconciliation and a better understanding between French and English Canada.</p>
<p>In 1965, the &#x201c;<a>Universit&#x00e9; d&#x2019;Ottawa - University of Ottawa</a>&#x201d; was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. With its new provincial charter as a publicly-funded institution, the University was given the dual mandate of furthering bilingualism and biculturalism, as well as preserving and developing the French culture in Ontario and in Canada.</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa implemented a policy on promoting bilingualism in 1974. Today, students have the choice to study in English, French, or both depending on their programme of study. Controversy has arisen over the years regarding implementing a course to be taught in both languages over alternating years, and eliminating English courses altogether in some faculties.</p>
<p>A study of full professors' employment contracts carried out by the Human Resources Service as part of <a>Vision 2010</a> concluded that about half of the professors are actively bilingual when they are hired. Ninety-seven percent of support-staff positions are designated as &#x201c;actively bilingual&#x201d; and 93% of these positions are held by bilingual staff.</p>
<p>From time to time the bilingual nature of the University of Ottawa has been the subject of linguistic debate. For example in October 2005, the Canadian French newspaper <em><a>Le Droit</a></em> reported on an internal memo to University of Ottawa recruiting officers heading to a recruitment fair in Toronto who were directed to speak solely in English while manning the booth. This sparked debate on the widely-held perception that students must speak French to study at the University of Ottawa. In fact just under 70 per cent of University of Ottawa students are anglophones, but most of the administration employees are francophones.</p>
<p>In March 2006, an open letter appeared in <em>Le Droit</em> signed by several University of Ottawa professors voicing their concerns on the status of French at the university. In the ensuing weeks, opinion pieces and letters to the editor ignited vigorous debate.</p>
<p>In June 2006, the university established a <a>Task Force on Programs and Services in French</a> mandated to submit to the senate a development plan for programs and services in French for 2007-2012 that will help the university fully assume its mission and commitment to promote and develop French culture in Ontario. A final report will be submitted to the senate in the spring of 2007.</p>
<p>The university is a member of <a>L'Association des universit&#x00e9;s de la francophonie canadienne</a>, a network of academic institutions of the Canadian Francophonie.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>The University of Ottawa's endowment as of April 2009 is <a>$</a>129.2 million.</p>
<p>The university also reported that over half of the expenditures for 2006-2007 were related to salaries and benefits.  Buildings, renovations, furniture, equipment and supplies collectively made up 23.3%.  Scholarships and bursaries made up 5.9%.  The gift by Telfer was also the biggest donation in history made to a Canadian business school.</p>
<h2>Notable people and alumni</h2>
