<p><strong>California State University, Bakersfield</strong> (often abbreviated <strong>CSUB</strong> or shortened to <strong>CSU Bakersfield</strong> or <strong>Cal State Bakersfield</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Bakersfield, California</a>, <a>United States</a> which was founded in 1965.  CSUB opened in 1970 on a 375 acre (1.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) campus, becoming the 19th school in the <a>California State University</a> system. The university offers 31 <a>bachelor's</a>, and 22 <a>master's degree</a> programs.</p>
<p>As of Fall 2002, some 7,700 undergraduate and graduate students attended CSUB, at either the main campus in Bakersfield or the satellite campus, Antelope Valley Center in <a>Lancaster, California</a>. CSU Bakersfield's <a>petroleum geology</a> program is the only one offered by a public university west of the <a>Rockies</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|The Walter Stiern Library, CSUB</a> CSUB owes its founding to the <a>Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960</a>, which formalized the creation of the CSU-system, initially as the &quot;California State Colleges&quot; system.  The areas in the Southern <a>San Joaquin Valley</a> had been demanding a four-year university since the 1950s.  After considering several locations, including nearby <a>Delano</a> and parts of <a>Kings</a> and <a>Tulare County</a>, a steering committee decided on Bakersfield because at the time it was the largest isolated metropolitan area in the United States without a four-year university.  Their decision was turned into a bill by Bakersfield's State Senator <a>Walter W. Stiern</a>, ratified by the <a>California State Legislature</a> and signed into law by Governor <a>Edmond G. Brown</a>.</p>
<p>Under these rules, the school was founded as California State College, Bakersfield in 1965.  It opened for classes in September 1970.  In 1982 the California State College system became the California State University system and the school changed to its present name.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners</a> CSUB is currently a <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> school. They began the process to move from <a>Division II</a> in 2006 and became a full Division I member starting in the 2010-11 school year. For <a>wrestling</a>, CSUB competes in the <a>Pac-10</a> conference. CSUB wrestling is the institution's original Division-I sport and has placed 3rd (1996) and 8th (1999) in the NCAA D-I Wrestling Championships. Men's and women's basketball teams compete at the <a>Rabobank Arena</a> in downtown Bakersfield.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2006, Cal State Bakersfield President Horace Mitchell formally announced that CSUB is raising $6 million over a five year period for the additional costs for the athletics program. Part of the additional costs is to start a <a>baseball</a> program and women's <a>golf</a> program. CSUB is looking to join the <a>Big West Conference</a>, an all-California conference that includes several former rivals of the Roadrunners.</p>
<p>Rudy Carvajal has been CSUB's <a>Athletic Director</a> since 1972. In 2005, Carvajal received the prestigious CSU Wang Family Award. Under Carvajal's leadership, CSUB has won over 30 national championships and received the <a>Sears Directors Cup</a> in 1998. Rudy Carvajal announced his retirement effective December 31, 2010. Nearly 60,000 people attend NCAA sporting events at CSU Bakersfield.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>CSUB has more than 90 official student clubs and organizations (including 10 Greek Organizations). The Associated Students Inc. (ASI) is the recognized student government and is known for having an active role on campus. CSUB's campus has a Student Union and a  Recreation Center.</p>
<p>CSUB is predominantly a commuter school, drawing its student body from a mix of recent high school graduates in the local area and working people returning to school or pursuing a degree part-time. In Fall 2006, CSUB received its highest enrollment of first-time freshmen of approximately 820.  The university official credit &quot;move to Division I&quot; for the increase of younger students.  While the majority of students live off-campus, the campus dorms can accommodate up to 324 students, or under 5% of the 2002 enrollment figure of 7,700.  Space in the dorms has historically been plentiful, with single-occupancy rooms often available and one entire dorm devoted to faculty offices through the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>The six buildings comprising the dorm complex are each named after locations in J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> novel: Rivendell, Rohan, Entwood, Numenor, Dobry, and Lorien.  Dorm facilities include a first floor lounge in each building, a dining commons, a swimming pool, a sand volleyball court, a pond, and a parking lot. CSUB is in the initial stages of building new dorms (referred to as Living Residences) on the northeast side of campus.</p>
<h2>Tradition</h2>
<p>The CSUB Fight Song and Alma Mater were selected through a structured contest initiated by the student government, Associated Students Inc. (ASI). The winner of the Fight Song Contest was a current music student, Gwendolyn Wilcox, and the winner of the Alma Mater Contest was a CSUB alumnus and current high school music instructor, Bill Ingram.</p>
