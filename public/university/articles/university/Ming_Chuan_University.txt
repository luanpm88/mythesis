<p><strong>Ming Chuan University</strong> (&#x9298;&#x50b3;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) is a selective private university founded by <a>Pao Teh-Ming</a>(&#x5305;&#x5fb7;&#x660e;) and her husband <a>Lee Ying-Chao</a>.  Named after the famous progressive <a>Qing Dynasty</a> governor of Taiwan <a>Liu Mingchuan</a>, it is known for its communication and business programs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institution was founded as a three year <a>junior women's college</a> in 1963 known as <strong>Ming Chuan College</strong>.  It expanded to offer a five year junior women's college program in 1964.  In Taiwan, the junior college program allows a high school freshman to by-pass the remaining years of high school and to enter a type of vocational college.</p>
<p>The institution experienced rapid growth in the 1990s.  In 1990, the institution gradually eliminated its junior college program and offered a coed program with a <a>bachelor's degree</a>.  With the completion of the construction of two additional campuses and the introduction of graduate degrees, Ming Chuan College was fully upgraded into Ming Chuan University in 1997.</p>
<p>In November of 2010, Ming Chuan University received accreditation by the Middle State Commission of Higher Education, making it the first university in Asia to be recognized in the United States education system. The university is in the same commission board with prominent schools such as Cornell, NYU, Columbia and Rutgers to name a few. </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The university is divided into three campuses.  The main campus is located in <a>Taipei City</a>'s <a>Shihlin District</a> near the <a>Taipei Grand Hotel</a>, and include more than 2000 steps to reach the top (no elevator)..  <a>Chiang Kai-shek</a> and his wife <a>Soong May-ling</a> donated the land for the main campus, resulting in the Lee family being one of the staunchest supporters in keeping the memory of Chiang Kai-shek alive in Taiwan. In addition to the main campus, there is a smaller campus located on Ji He street, very close the the main campus and located near the entrance to the famous Shilin Night Market.  The second campus is located in <a>Gueishan</a>, <a>Taoyuan County</a>.  The Lee family originally intended the land for the second campus to be a fruit orchard, but decided to use the land to expand the school so that it could achieve full-university status.  The third campus on <a>Kinmen</a> Island is meant to expand the educational opportunities of the residents there.</p>
