<p>Founded in 1734 by King <a>George II</a> of <a>Great Britain</a> and the Elector of <a>Hanover</a>, it opened for classes in 1737. The University of G&#x00f6;ttingen soon grew in size and popularity. <a>G&#x00f6;ttingen</a> is a historic university city, with a high student and faculty population.</p>
<p>The University of G&#x00f6;ttingen is one of the highest-ranked universities in Germany. It is associated with 45 <a>Nobel laureates</a>.</p>
<p>The university has a sound international reputation and was ranked 1st in Germany, 9th in Europe and 43rd in the world in 2010 by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>. At the same time, it was ranked 4th in Germany, 30th in Europe and 93rd in the world in 2010 by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>

<p>In 1734, King <a>George II</a> of <a>Great Britain</a>, and the Elector of <a>Hanover</a>, gave his Prime Minister, Gerlach Adolph von M&#x00fc;nchhausen, the order to establish a university in G&#x00f6;ttingen to propagate the ideas of academic freedom and enlightenment at the times of the European <a>Enlightenment</a>.</p>
<h3>18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &ndash; 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries</h3>
<p>Throughout the remainder of the 18th century the University of G&#x00f6;ttingen was in the top rank of German universities, with its free spirit and atmosphere of scientific exploration and research. By 1812, G&#x00f6;ttingen had become an internationally acknowledged modern university with a library of more than 250,000 volumes. <a>Napoleon</a> had studied law here and remarked that &quot;G&#x00f6;ttingen belongs to the whole Europe&quot;.</p>
<p>In the first years of the University of G&#x00f6;ttingen it became known for its faculty of law. In the 18th century <a>Johann Stephan P&#x00fc;tter</a>, the most prestigious scholar of public law at that time, taught <a>jus publicum</a> here for half a century. The subject had attracted students such as <a>Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich</a>, later diplomat and Prime Minister of <a>Austria</a>, and <a>Wilhelm von Humboldt</a>, who later established the <a>University of Berlin</a>. In 1809 <a>Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, the German philosopher best known for his work <em>The World as Will and Representation</em>, became a student at the university, where he studied <a>metaphysics</a> and <a>psychology</a> under <a>Gottlob Ernst Schulze</a>, who advised him to concentrate on <a>Plato</a> and <a>Kant</a>. <a>right|thumb|upright|King George II in the Pauliner Church in 1748</a></p>
<p>By the university's centenary in 1837, it was known as the &quot;university of law&quot;, as the students enrolled by the faculty of law often made up more than half of the university's students. G&#x00f6;ttingen became a Mecca for the study of public law in Germany. <a>Heinrich Heine</a>, the famous German poet, studied law and was awarded the degree of <a>Dr.iur.</a>.</p>
<p>However, political disturbances, in which both professors and students were implicated, lowered the attendance to 860 in 1834. The expulsion in 1837 of the seven professors - <em>Die <a>G&#x00f6;ttinger Sieben</a></em> - the Germanist, <a>Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht</a> (1800&#x2013;1876); the historian <a>Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann</a> (1785&#x2013;1860); the orientalist <a>Georg Heinrich August Ewald</a> (1803&#x2013;1875); the historian <a>Georg Gottfried Gervinus</a> (1805-1875); the physicist <a>Wilhelm Eduard Weber</a> (1804&#x2013;1891); and the philologists, the brothers <a>Jakob</a> (1785&#x2013;1863) and <a>Wilhelm Grimm</a> (1786&#x2013;1859), for protesting against the revocation by King <a>Ernest Augustus I of Hanover</a> of the liberal constitution of 1833, further reduced the prosperity of the university. Prior to this, the <a>Brothers Grimm</a> had taught here and compiled the first German Dictionary. <a>left|thumb|The old Building of the University and its library in 1815</a></p>
<p>[[Image:Goe.Paulinerstr.Paulinerkirche.SUB.JPG|right|thumb|The Pauliner Church, once the seat of the University Library where [[Heinrich Heine]], <a>Brothers Grimm</a> and <a>Goethe</a> had worked ]] In the 19th century, <a>Gustav von Hugo</a>, the forerunner of the historical school of law, and <a>Rudolf von Jhering</a>, a jurist who created the theory of &quot;culpa in contraendo&quot; and wrote <em>Battle for Right</em>, taught here and maintained the reputation of the faculty of law. <a>Otto von Bismarck</a>, the main creator and the first Chancellor of the second <a>German Empire</a>, had also studied law in G&#x00f6;ttingen in 1833: he lived in a tiny house on the &quot;Wall&quot;, now known as &quot;Bismarck Cottage&quot;. According to oral tradition, he lived there because his rowdiness had caused him to be banned from living within the city walls.</p>
<p>G&#x00f6;ttingen also had a focus on natural science, especially mathematics. <a>Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> taught here in the 19th century. <a>Bernhard Riemann</a>, <a>Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet</a> and a number of significant mathematicians made their contributions to mathematics here. By 1900, <a>David Hilbert</a> and <a>Felix Klein</a> had attracted mathematicians from around the world to G&#x00f6;ttingen, which made G&#x00f6;ttingen a world mecca of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<h3>End of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century &ndash; beginning of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century</h3>
<p>During this period, the University of G&#x00f6;ttingen achieved its academic peak. <a>left|thumb|The old Auditorium Maximum (built in 1826-1865)</a></p>
<p>In 1903, its teaching staff numbered 121 and its students 1529. <a>Ludwig Prandtl</a> joined the university in 1904, and developed it into a leader in <a>fluid mechanics</a> and in <a>aerodynamics</a> over the next two decades. In 1925, Prandtl was appointed as the director of the <a>Kaiser Wilhelm Institute</a> for Fluid Mechanics. Many of Prandtl's students went on to make fundamental contributions to aerodynamics.</p>
<p>To date, 45 <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates have studied, taught or made contributions here. Most of these prizes were given in the first half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, which was called the &quot;G&#x00f6;ttingen Nobel prize wonder&quot;. [[Image:G&#x00f6;ttingen Aula May06.jpg|thumb|Alte Aula (<em>Great Hall</em>), also [[Karzer]], at Wilhelmsplatz (built in 1835-1837)]]</p>
<p>Social studies and the study of humanities continued to flourish. <a>Edmund Husserl</a>, the philosopher and known as the father of <a>phenomenology</a>, taught here. <a>Max Weber</a>, the sociologist studied here for one term.</p>
<h3>The &quot;great purge&quot; of 1933</h3>
<p>In the 1930s, the university became a focal point for the <a>Nazi</a> crackdown on &quot;Jewish physics&quot;, as represented by the work of <a>Albert Einstein</a>. In what was later called the <a>&quot;great purge&quot; of 1933</a>, academics including <a>Max Born</a>, <a>Victor Goldschmidt</a>, <a>James Franck</a>, <a>Eugene Wigner</a>, <a>Le&#x00f3; Szil&#x00e1;rd</a>, <a>Edward Teller</a>, <a>Emmy Noether</a>, and <a>Richard Courant</a> were expelled or fled. The legacy of greatness in mathematics, a lineage which had included <a>Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> and <a>Bernhard Riemann</a>, was broken. <a>left|thumb|upright|The Monument of King William IV who bequeathed Aula to the university in 1837</a> <a>right|thumb|The interior of the university Aula</a></p>
<p>Though <a>David Hilbert</a> remained, by the time he died in 1943, the Nazis had essentially gutted the university, since many of the top faculty were either Jewish or had married Jews. Most of them fled <a>Nazi Germany</a> for places like the <a>United States</a>, <a>Canada</a>, the <a>United Kingdom</a>, and <a>Ireland</a>. About a year after the purge, Hilbert attended a banquet and was seated next to the new Minister of Education, <a>Bernhard Rust</a>. Rust asked, &quot;How is mathematics in G&#x00f6;ttingen now that it has been freed of the Jewish influence?&quot; Hilbert replied, &quot;Mathematics in G&#x00f6;ttingen? There is really none any more&quot; (Reid, 205). Today, G&#x00f6;ttingen has a respectable, but no longer a world-famous, mathematics department.</p>
<h3>Renovation after War</h3>
<p>After <a>World War II</a>, the University of G&#x00f6;ttingen was the first university in the <a>western Zones</a> to be re-opened under British control in 1945. <a>J&#x00fc;rgen Habermas</a>, a German philosopher and sociologist, pursued his study here in G&#x00f6;ttingen. Later, <a>Richard von Weizs&#x00e4;cker</a>, the former <a>President of Germany</a>, earned his <a>Dr.Jur.</a> here. <a>Gerhard Schr&#x00f6;der</a>, the former <a>Chancellor of Germany</a>, also graduated from the school of law here in G&#x00f6;ttingen, and he became a lawyer thereafter.</p>
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>Today the university consists of 13 faculties and about 24,000 students are enrolled. More than 2,500 professors and other academics work at the University, assisted by a technical and administrative staff of over 10,000. The post-war expansion of the University led to the establishment of a new, modern 'university quarter' in the north of the town. The architecture of the old university can still be seen in the Auditorium Maximum (1826/1865) and the Great Hall (1835/1837) on the Wilhelmsplatz.</p>

<h2>Tradition</h2>
<p>The most famous tradition of the university is that every PhD student who has just passed her/his <em>rigorosum</em> (oral doctoral test) shall sit in a wagon - decorated with flowers and balloons and accompanied by relatives and friends, drive around the inner city and arrive at the Marktplatz - the central square where the old town hall and the G&#x00e4;nseliesel statue are located. The &quot;newly born doctor&quot; shall climb up to the statue of G&#x00e4;nseliesel (a poor princess in an old fairy tale who was compelled to keep geese by a wicked woman and later regained her identity), kiss the G&#x00e4;nseliesel and give bouquets to her.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p>There is an old saying about life in G&#x00f6;ttingen, still inscribed in Latin nowadays on the wall of the entrance to the Ratskeller (the restaurant located in the basement of the old town hall): Extra Gottingam non est vita, si est vita, non est ita (There is no life outside G&#x00f6;ttingen. Even if it is life, it is no life like here).</p>
<p>&quot;Ancient university towns are wonderfully alike. G&#x00f6;ttingen is like Cambridge in England or Yale in America: very provincial, not on the way to anywhere - no one comes to these backwaters except for the company of professors. And the professors are sure that this is the centre of the world. There is an inscription in the <a>Rathskeller</a> there which reads 'Extra Gottingam non est vita', 'Outside G&#x00f6;ttingen there is no life'. This epigram, or should I call it epitaph, is not taken as seriously by the undergraduates as by the professors.&quot;(Bronowski, 1973, The Ascent of Man, p.&nbsp;360) <a>left|thumb|G&#x00e4;nseliesel fountain and pedestrian zone</a></p>
<p>The university is spread out in several locations around the city: The central university complex with the main library and <em>Mensa</em> (dining hall) is located right next to the inner city and comprises the faculties for Theology, Law, Economics/Business Administration and Linguistics. The departments of Ancient History, Classics, various languages, and Psychology are nearby. Elsewhere in the city are the departments of Anthropology, Mathematics and Educational Sciences as well as the Medical Faculty with its associated hospitals.</p>
<p>Just north of the city a new scientific center has been built in which most of the natural sciences (Chemistry, Microbiology, Plant Pathology, Agronomy, Forestry, Geology, Physics, Computer Science) are now located, including the GZMB. Other institutes are set around the inner city.</p>
<p>The University offers eight snack shops and six <em>Mensas</em> serving lunch at low prices for the students. One <em>Mensa</em> also provides dinner for students.</p>
