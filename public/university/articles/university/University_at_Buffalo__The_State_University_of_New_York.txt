<p> </p>
<p><strong>State University of New York at Buffalo</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>University at Buffalo</strong> or <strong>UB</strong>, is a <a>public</a> research university which has multiple campuses located in <a>Buffalo</a> and <a>Amherst, New York</a>, USA.  Offering 84 <a>bachelor's</a>, 184 <a>master's</a> and 78 <a>doctoral</a> degrees, it is a flagship campus  and the largest of the four comprehensive university centers within the <a>State University of New York</a> (SUNY) system.  From its inception in 1846 until 1962, the private school was known as the <strong>University of Buffalo</strong>. Once it became a state university, the name was changed, but many alumni still refer to it by the former name.</p>
<p>According to the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>, the University at Buffalo is a Research University with Very High Research Activity (RU/VH). In 1989, UB was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, which represents 63 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.  UB's alumni and faculty have produced a <a>U.S. President</a>, <a>astronauts</a>, <a>Nobel laureates</a>, <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners, and other notable individuals in their fields. The University houses the largest state-operated <a>medical school</a> and features the only state <a>law school</a>, <a>architecture</a> and <a>urban planning</a> school, and <a>pharmacy</a> school in the state of New York.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Initial years</h3>
<p>The University of Buffalo was founded in May 1846 as a private medical school to train the doctors for the communities of <a>Buffalo</a>, <a>Niagara Falls</a>, and surrounding villages. James Platt White was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the University of Buffalo from the state legislature in 1846. He also taught the first class of 89 men in obstetrics.</p>
<p>The doors first opened to students in 1847 and after associating with a hospital for teaching purposes, the first class of students graduated the medical school in July 1847. The first chancellor of the University was future President of the United States <a>Millard Fillmore</a>. Upon his ascension to the presidency after President Taylor's death, Fillmore stayed on as part-time chancellor. Fillmore's name now graces the continuing education school Millard Fillmore College located on the South Campus as well as the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, an academic and administrative services building at the core of the residential Joseph Ellicott Complex, located on the North Campus.</p>
<h3>Early development</h3>
<p>After many expansions to the college medical programs, including the addition of a pharmacy division, UB acquired the Buffalo Law School from <a>Niagara University</a> in 1891 and formed the <a>University of Buffalo Law School</a>.</p>
<p>In 1909 the University acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the first buildings on what would later become UB's initial comprehensive campus. Although the South Campus (also called the &quot;Main Street&quot; campus) is often referred to as the &quot;original campus&quot;, the South (Main Street) Campus is not actually the University's oldest property. UB was originally housed in a leased building, the First Baptist Church, which had also served as a post office from 1836-1846.</p>
<p>In 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the College of Arts and Sciences, formally departing from its tradition of teaching only for licensed professional fields. During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. During the 1998-1999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1950, the <a>Industrial Engineering</a> department branched off from the <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> department. In 1956, a <a>Civil Engineering</a> Department was formed under <a>Lehigh University</a> graduate <a>Robert L. Ketter</a>, who went on to become Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University.</p>
<p>In 1959, <a>WBFO</a> was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern <a>National Public Radio</a> personalities: <a>Terri Gross</a> and <a>Ira Flatow</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, the private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the SUNY system, and became known as the University <em>at</em> Buffalo or SUNY at Buffalo.</p>
<p>[[Image:UB-Reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[nuclear reactor]] on the South Campus]] In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This little known program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with government-run research labs operated by rival <a>UC Berkeley</a>. Consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was formally decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.</p>
<p>In 1964, UB acquired property in the northern town of <a>Amherst</a> for future development of a second campus catering to most non-medical disciplines at UB. This would later become the North Campus, and the center of most non-medical UB activity.</p>
<h3>UB 2020</h3>
<p>Started in 2004 under President John B. Simpson, UB 2020 is a massive strategic planning initiative to develop and implement a vision for the university over the next 15 years. The centerpiece of UB 2020 is to add about 10,000 more students, 750 faculty members and 600 staff, increasing the size of the University by about 40 percent. UB 2020 also recognizes the university's contribution to the surrounding region. The most recent estimates of UB's impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.50 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB, whose annual budget is currently $96 million. Both of these figures are also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB&#x2019;s institutional growth.</p>
<p>The five major principles that guide UB 2020 are promoting academic excellence (e.g.: the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and the development of vital intellectual communities); promoting a united and accessible university campus that features three strong, distinctive and seamlessly interconnected centers and facilitates social interaction; reflecting the university&#x2019;s responsibility to the community by respecting public plans and policies; providing the basis for long-range capital programming and stewardship of university resources; and establishing UB as a leader in environmental stewardship and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The four main components of UB 2020 are &quot;Excelling in Academics,&quot; &quot;Strategic Strengths,&quot; &quot;Building UB: The Comprehensive Physical Plan,&quot; and &quot;Achieving Growth&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan is the passage of S2020 and A2020 by the New York State Legislature.  The bill is known as the UB 2020 flexibility and economic growth act.  On June 3, 2009 the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Physical Plan</h4>
<p>The University at Buffalo has accumulated 27,700 undergraduate and <a>graduate students</a>, as well as 14,000 employees, across three campuses in the last 160 years. In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities. Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project. The firm granted the contract to lead the project is <a>Beyer Blinder Belle</a>.</p>
<p>The comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases. Currently, UB is implementing &quot;phase one&quot; by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion. The project recognizes UB&#x2019;s potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University at Buffalo is the state&#x2019;s largest and most comprehensive public university and is spread across three campuses: North Campus, South Campus, and Downtown Campus. The Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card awarded the university a B-.</p>
<h3>North Campus</h3>
<p>Construction of this campus began in the 1970s. Many academic programs, including the entirety of the College of Arts and Sciences, the <a>University at Buffalo Law School</a>, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Management, the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the Graduate School of Education, as well as <a>Lockwood Memorial Library</a>, Capen Library, and many administrative offices, are located on UB's North Campus in <a>Amherst, NY</a>.</p>
<p>The North Campus is home to administrative offices and the academic &quot;spine&quot; that includes most of UB's academic buildings. It covers  with 146 buildings containing , 10 residence halls and 5 apartment complexes. The college was designed by architect E.B. Green in 1910, and was intended to resemble <a>Trinity College, Dublin</a>. The South Campus, also the initial campus, is located on  in northeastern Buffalo.  Its 53 buildings contain () and include six resident halls. a former elementary school converted with an all-glass atrium exhibit space.</p>
<h3>Downtown Campus</h3>
<p>In 2002, UB commissioned Boston firm Chan Krieger to create a third campus center. as well as the <a>Roswell Park Cancer Institute</a> and <a>Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute</a> to compose the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus. Also located in the downtown area is UB's Research Institute on Addictions (RIA), Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) and the Jacobs Executive Development Center (JEDC). The campus includes six major properties and a total of 43 buildings, counting shared lease space ().</p>
<p>In September 2007, UB added the former <a>M. Wile and Company Factory Building</a> on the southeast corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets and the former <a>Trico Products Corp. building complex</a> on the northwest corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets to its properties downtown. The UB Regional Institute, Center on Rehabilitation Synergy, and a number of pre-K-16 initiatives related to UB's civic engagement mission, such as the UB-Buffalo Public Schools Partnership office, are set to relocate to the first site. The latter location has been purchased to house additional biomedical- and life science-related businesses connected to the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.</p>
<h4>Teaching hospitals</h4>
<p>UB's teaching hospitals include Buffalo General Hospital, the Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), Millard Fillmore Hospital, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Veterans Affairs Western New York Health Care System. Additional facilities include free clinics such as the Kaleida Health's Niagara Family Health Center and the Lighthouse Free Medical Clinic, a program run by UB medical students.</p>

<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Although the university's official name remains the &quot;State University of New York at Buffalo&quot; the school's public relation and marketing efforts have evolved, and there are three names deemed acceptable when not using the official name, according to &quot;The University at Buffalo Visual Identity&quot;, with a fourth acceptable for reference to athletic programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>University at Buffalo, The State University of New York</em>. This is the full unofficial name, used by the university for formal communications to national audiences.</li>
  <li><em>University at Buffalo</em>. This is the less formal unofficial name, used within the university, and with many outside groups that are familiar with the predecessor <em>University of Buffalo</em>.</li>
  <li><em>UB</em>. This shortened term &quot;UB&quot; is the marketing staff's preferred casual term to refer to school.</li>
  <li><em>Buffalo</em>. This is the name used by the university's athletic department, particularly on uniforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Visual Identify guide does not explain its concerns with the university's official name.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|O'Brian Hall, houses the UB Law School. Baldy Hall is on the left and is home to the Graduate School of Education and the Graduate School of Social Work.</a> UB's admission is selective.  Emphasis has been placed on developing a community of research scientists centered around an economic initiative to promote Buffalo and create the Center of Excellence for Bioinformatics and Life Sciences as well as other advanced biomedical and engineering disciplines. The university's Center for Computational Research (CCR) is one of the most powerful academic supercomputing sites in the eastern United States, which once ranked 22nd out of the top 500 supercomputing sites in the world; as of November 2006, it was ranked 87th.  However, as of November 2009, UB no longer ranked in the top 500 supercomputing sites in the world.</p>
<p>Because of fluctuating state funding, UB has invested in such commercially beneficial fields as medicine, biotechnology, and <a>bioinformatics</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, UB was a technology pioneer, offering an early <a>Computer Science</a> major (distinct from a mathematics major).  Additionally, UB played a significant role as a crucial internet hub for the eastern seaboard during the internet's inception.</p>
<p>Buffalo ranked 77-107 worldwide among universities in the social sciences in 2008 by the Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>University at Buffalo academic and professional faculty are represented by United University Professions. The two UUP chapters at the University at Buffalo are Health Sciences and Buffalo Center. United University Professions has over 34,000 members at 29 campuses of SUNY.</p>
<p>The University at Buffalo is also one of only two public schools in New York to have a medical school and a dental school, the other being the <a>State University of New York at Stony Brook</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Total R&amp;D expenditures rose from $186.8 million to $259.0 million for FY 2001&#x2013;04, ranking 58 under <a>New York University</a> (NYU). It rose to $297,909,000 for the year 2006.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>UB has a total student capacity estimated around 33,000 total students, a number which is quite common among other &quot;super university&quot; schools, though the school has never seen this many enrolled students. The University at Buffalo is the largest public university in the northeastern United States (comprising New England and New York State). Student enrollment trends reported by the University at Buffalo's Office of Academic Planning and Budget reflect UB's growing student population:</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Associations and activities</h3>
<p> UB boasts two student-run periodicals: <em><a>The Spectrum</a></em>,  and <em>Generation</em> magazine. Both publications are distributed on campus.  <em>The Spectrum</em> is the only independent publication. <em>Generation</em> is funded by advertising and through Sub-Board I, Inc., the student services corporation. UB also has a student radio station, WRUB. WRUB broadcasts all UB home football games and select road games, as well as most UB men's and women's home basketball games.</p>
<p>UB annually hosts the world&#x2019;s largest mud-volleyball game know as &#x201c;Ooz-fest&#x201d;. Teams of at least six students compete in a double elimination volleyball tournament at &#x201c;The Mud Pit&#x201d; each April. Fire trucks are brought in to saturate the dirt courts to create the mud. Awards are handed out to not only the victors, but the most creatively dressed. In the past, students have worn business suits and even dresses to the tournament.</p>
<p>UB clubs are run through the Undergraduate Student Association and the Graduate Student Association, with each level requiring respective senate recognition for clubs.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> The school's sports teams are known as the <a>Buffalo Bulls</a>. However, the women's teams were originally called the Buffalo Royals.</p>
<p>In 1958, the football team won the <a>Lambert Cup</a>, emblematic of supremacy in Eastern U.S. small-college football. That led to the team's first bowl invitation, to the <a>Tangerine Bowl</a> in <a>Orlando, Florida</a>, against <a>Florida State University</a>.  But the Bulls would be allowed to participate only if backup defensive end <a>Mike Wilson</a> and starting halfback <a>Willie Evans</a>, who were black, did not play.  The team stood behind the two, and refused the bowl offer; Buffalo did not receive another bowl invitation until the 2008 season.</p>
<p>Several UB football stars from the 1950s and early 1960s went on to play professional football, including quarterback <a>John Stofa</a> with the <a>American Football League</a>'s <a>Miami Dolphins</a> and <a>Cincinnati Bengals</a>, and defensive lineman <a>Gerry Philbin</a> with the <a>AFL</a>'s <a>New York Jets</a>. Philbin is a member of the AFL Hall of Fame and the <a>All-time All-AFL Team</a>. Philbin and UB's <a>Willie Ross</a> were the only UB graduates to play on professional football championship teams in the United States: Ross with the 1964 AFL Champion <a>Buffalo Bills</a>; and Philbin with the 1968 AFL Champion <a>New York Jets</a>, who also won that season's <a>AFL-NFL World Championship Game</a> (Super Bowl III).  <a>Ramon Guzman</a> played on the 2009 <a>Grey Cup</a> champion <a>Montreal Alouettes</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the UB teams have participated in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I (I-A for <a>football</a>), in the <a>Mid-American Conference</a>. The mascots are 'Victor E. Bull', a blue bull with a gold nose ring, and his sister 'Victoria S. Bull'. After several years of poor performance in the two most popular college sports, men's basketball and football, the university's men's basketball team has recently begun to show some promise. In March 2005, the team fell short by only 0.5 seconds (for the Mid-American Conference Championship) of clinching a spot in the NCAA Tournament. The school's football team, however, performed poorly that year, winning just one game during the season. At the end of the 2005 season, football coach Jim Hofher was dismissed from his position.</p>
<p>On March 25, 2009, the athletic department announced that the rowing program has joined the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a> as an associate member.</p>
<p>With the hiring of <a>Turner Gill</a> as head football coach, UB was the only Division I-A school with an African American athletic director (Warde Manuel), men's basketball head coach (Reggie Witherspoon), and football head coach (Gill).</p>
<p>The university is home to the <a>Thunder of the East</a> marching band. The band performs at all home football games and travels to both local and national parades and competitions.</p>
<p><a>Jamey Richard</a>, 2008 graduate of the University of Buffalo, plays in the <a>National Football League</a> and was selected by the <a>Indianapolis Colts</a> in the 7th round, with the 236 pick of the <a>2008 NFL Draft</a>. <a>Trevor Scott</a>, 2008 graduate of the University of Buffalo, plays in the NFL and was selected by the <a>Oakland Raiders</a>. Quarterback <a>Drew Willy</a>, 2009 graduate of the University of Buffalo, was recently signed to the practice squad of the <a>Indianapolis Colts</a>, as well as James Starks (6th round, 193rd overall) who now plays with the <a>Green Bay Packers</a>. And Naaman Roosevelt (Undrafted, started off as a player on the practice squad, but moved to the big club later on) who plays for the <a>Buffalo Bills</a>   </p>
<p>Buffalo has three fight songs: &quot;Victory March&quot;, &quot;Go For a Touchdown&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo Fight Song&quot;.</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Hadley Village Apartments at North Campus</a></p>
<p>Student residence halls are located on both the North and South Campuses. In 1999, the university built its first apartment complex for families and graduate students at Flickinger Court. Since the success of Flickinger, UB has developed South Lake Village, Hadley Village, Flint Village, and Creekside Apartments. Most students who wish to still live on or near the North Campus but enjoy the lifestyle of apartment living take advantage of these apartments. Collegiate Village off campus apartments offers transportation to both North and South Campus.  Students also find housing in private locations.  Those locations are generally situated in the University Heights district of Buffalo, and other areas close to the North and South Campuses. The school assigns rooms based on a lottery system.</p>
