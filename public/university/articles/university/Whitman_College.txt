<p><strong>Whitman College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>co-educational</a>, non-sectarian, residential <a>undergraduate</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Walla Walla, Washington</a>.  Initially founded as a seminary by a territorial legislative charter in 1859, the school became a four year degree granting institution in 1883. Whitman College is accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and competes athletically in the NCAA Division III Northwest Conference.  The school offers 46 majors and 31 minors in the liberal arts and sciences .  Whitman was the first college in the U.S. northwest to receive a <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> chapter, and the first school in the <a>United States</a> to require comprehensive exams for graduation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- <a>thumb|right|Marcus and Narcissa Whitman.</a> --&gt;</p>
<h3>Whitman seminary</h3>
<p>Whitman Seminary, the precursor to Whitman College, was chartered by the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1859 at the request of Cushing Eells as a memorial to <a>Marcus</a> and <a>Narcissa Whitman</a>, <a>missionaries</a> who had died twelve years earlier in the <a>Whitman Massacre</a> at their mission site near present day Walla Walla, Washington.  Eells initially wanted to locate the pre-collegiate academy on the former mission site, but pressure from newly founded Walla Walla, combined with the donation of land in 1859 by prominent local Dorsey Syng Baker, led to the school opening in town.  After Eells resigned as principal in 1869, the seminary had difficulty competing with other local schools for pupils and remaining financially solvent.</p>
<h3>From seminary to college</h3>
<p>Whitman's trustees decided in 1882 that while their institution could not continue as a prep school, it might survive as the area's only college.  Alexander Jay Anderson, the former president of the Territorial University (now the <a>University of Washington</a>), came to turn the institution into a college and become its president.  After modeling the institution after North East liberal arts colleges, Anderson opened the school on September 4, 1882 (<a>Marcus Whitman</a>'s birthday) with an enrollment of 60 students and three senior faculty (Anderson, his wife and son).  In 1883, the school received a collegiate charter and began expanding with aid from the <a>Congregational American College and Education Society</a>.</p>
<h3>Financial turmoil and new leadership</h3>
<p>Despite local support for Whitman college and help from the Congregational community, financial troubles set in for the school.  After losing favor with some of the schools supporters, Anderson left Whitman in 1891 to be replaced by Reverend James Francis Eaton.  The continuing recession of the 1890s increased the institution's financial worries and lost Eaton his backing, leading to his resignation in 1894.</p>
<p>Reverend <a>Stephen Penrose</a>, an area Congregational minister and former trustee, became president of the college and brought the school back to solvency by establishing Whitman's endowment with the aid of D. K. Pearsons, a <a>Chicago</a> <a>philanthropist</a>.  By popularizing <a>Marcus Whitman</a>'s life and accomplishments (including the suspect claim that the missionary had been pivotal in the annexation by the United States of <a>Oregon Territory</a>), Penrose was able to gain support and resources for the college. Under his leadership, the faculty was strengthened and the first masonry buildings, Billings Hall and the Whitman Memorial Building, were constructed.</p>
<h3>The end of religious affiliation</h3>
<p>In 1907, Penrose began a plan called &quot;Greater Whitman&quot; which sought to transform the college into an advanced technical and science center.  To aid fundraising, Penrose abandoned affiliation with the Congregational Church, and became unaffiliated with any denomination.  The prep school was closed and fraternities and sororities were introduced to the campus.  Ultimately, this program was unable to raise enough capital; in 1912, the plan was abandoned and Whitman College returned to being a small liberal arts institution, albeit with increased focus on co-curricular activities.  Penrose iterated the school's purpose &quot;to be a small college, with a limited number of students to whom it will give the finest quality of education&#x201d; .  In 1920 Phi Beta Kappa installed a chapter, the first for a Northwest college , and Whitman had its first alum <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Styx statue at Whitman College.jpg|thumb|180px|&quot;Styx&quot; (2002), by [[Deborah Butterfield]], sits on Ankeny Field.]] <a>thumb|180px|A view toward the Quad from the steps of Penrose Library.</a></p>
<p>The campus includes streams, ponds, trees and numerous outdoor sculptures. At the center of campus is Ankeny Field, which forms part of the main quad and is a popular spot for intramural sports. College Creek (a segment of Mill Creek) meanders through the main campus, forming ponds (most notably Lakum Duckum) and providing a habitat for Whitman's many <a>ducks</a> and an occasional pair of white geese.</p>
<p>About 70% of the student body resides in school housing. Two of eight residence halls date to the early 1900s and several residence buildings are of <a>neoclassical</a> architectural design. There are eleven &quot;Interest House&quot; residences which are mostly of <a>Victorian</a> and classical design.  Academic facilities are newer and of more <a>modern</a> design.</p>
<p>Three women's <a>sororities</a> (<a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, <a>Delta Gamma</a>, and <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a>) are housed in the Prentiss Hall school residence hall and four men's <a>fraternities</a> (<a>Sigma Chi</a>, <a>Beta Theta Pi</a>, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, and <a>Tau Kappa Epsilon</a>) are housed in fraternity houses north of Isaacs Avenue.  Downtown Walla Walla is a few blocks to the west of the campus. The college also has other land holdings outside the main campus area, one of which &#x2014; the Johnson Wilderness Campus &#x2014; is used for academic and social retreats.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>About 1450 undergraduate students are enrolled in Whitman College, 56% female to 44% male.  Greek life is notable on campus; there is high percentage of students, around 33%, in fraternities and sororities. There are many student activities, many of which focus on student <a>activism</a> and social improvement. Many students also choose to participate in <a>varsity</a>, club, and <a>intramural sports</a> such as <a>rugby union</a>, <a>waterpolo</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>dodgeball</a>, and nationally renowned <a>cycling</a> and <a>Ultimate</a> teams. Special interest housing for <a>foreign language</a> program students is also available.</p>
<p>The college offers 42 fields of study for <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees.  There are also 10 additional areas that offer solely minor studies.</p>
<p>Degrees are awarded after successful completion of senior &quot;comprehensive exams.&quot;  These exams vary depending on the students' primary focus of study, but commonly include some combination of i) a senior <a>thesis</a>, ii) written examination, and iii) oral examination.  The oral examination is either a defense of the student's senior thesis, or is one or multiple exams of material the student is expected to have learned during their major.  The written exam is either a <a>GRE</a> subject test or a test composed by the department.</p>
<p> For students who are interested in <a>foreign policy</a>, Whitman is one of 16 institutions participating in the two-year-old <a>Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship</a> program. The <a>State Department</a> pays for fellows to obtain their master's degree at the university of their choice in return for three years of service as a <a>Foreign Service</a> Officer. Whitman has a number of <a>alumni</a> who serve in <a>foreign affairs</a>. </p>
<p>Students can take advantage of one of the most loyal <a>alumni</a> networks in the nation through the Career Consultant Network, which includes many alumni.</p>
<p>Whitman's Speech and Debate Program is active in policy (CEDA-NDT) and parliamentary (NPDA-NPTE) debate as well as individual events. Each year, 24 to 30 students participate in the program. Students travel to tournaments throughout the west coast as well as nationally. Whitman students Adam Symonds and Jessica Clarke won the CEDA National Championship in 1999.</p>
<p>Whitman also offers combined programs in conjunction with several institutions throughout the United States:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>3-2 programs</a> in engineering with the <a>California Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Columbia University</a>, <a>Duke University</a>, <a>University of Washington</a>, and <a>Washington University</a>;</li>
  <li>3-2 programs in forestry and environmental management with <a>Duke University</a>, leading to a Master of Environmental Management or an <a>MBA</a> degree;</li>
  <li>A 3-2 program in oceanography at <a>University of Washington</a>, leading to a Whitman B.A. and a U. of Washington B.S. in Oceanography;</li>
  <li>A 4-1 combined program in elementary education with the <a>Bank Street College</a> of Education in <a>New York City</a>, culminating in a bachelor's degree from Whitman, a master's degree from Bank Street, and the requirements for teaching certification</li>
</ul>
<p>Whitman offers a &quot;Semester in the West&quot; program, a field study program in <a>environmental studies</a>, focusing on ecological, social, and political issues confronting the <a>American West</a>. For a full semester, 20 accepted students will travel the West, focusing on various issues.</p>
<p>Whitman is listed in <a>Loren Pope's</a> book <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Whitman holds membership in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Northwest Conference</a> (<a>Division III</a>) and fields nine <a>varsity teams</a> each for men and women. More than 70 percent of the student body participates in <a>intramural sports</a>; more than 20 percent participate in a varsity sport.</p>
<p>Whitman's official <a>mascot</a>, named the 'Fighting <a>Missionary</a>' after Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, is a source of debate, with many student organizations and athletic teams wishing to change it in order to avoid the implied <a>cultural imperialism</a>. However, many alumni are in favor of keeping the unique mascot, which inspired the <a>innuendo</a>-laden cheer &quot;Missionaries, Missionaries, We're On Top!&quot; Current campaigns to change the mascot support the 'Duck', named for the many ducks residing in campus creeks and ponds, as a culturally neutral mascot. </p>
<p>In addition, the Whitman Cycling team has managed to win DII National Championships for the past two years, and 4 times in the past 6 years, making them the athletic team at Whitman with the most National Championships, despite their club sport status.</p>
