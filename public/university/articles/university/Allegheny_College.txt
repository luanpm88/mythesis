<p> <strong>Allegheny College</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in northwestern <a>Pennsylvania</a> in the town of <a>Meadville</a>. Founded in 1815, the college has approximately 2300 students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p> Allegheny was founded in April 1815  Alden served as President until 1831, when financial and enrollment difficulties forced his resignation.</p>

Tarbell]] was a crusading muckraking journalist who exposed abuses by <a>Standard Oil</a>.]] Allegheny began admitting females in 1870, But the surcharge was soon dropped; and a woman was valedictorian of the Allegheny class of 1875. One source suggests that <a>Ida Tarbell</a>, the pioneering journalist who exposed the predatory practices of Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, was the first woman to attend Allegheny. <a>thumb|px=500|left|alt=Black and white blurry photo shows Allegheny College campus in 1909 in winter with trees with no leaves|Allegheny College in 1909.

<p>In 1905, Allegheny built Alden Hall as a new and improved preparatory school. Over the decades the college has grown in size and significance while still maintaining ties to the community.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>In 1971 the film <em><a>Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</a></em> based on the <a>Richard Farina</a> novel was filmed on college grounds.</p>
<p>While the word &quot;Allegheny&quot; is a brand for the college, it is also the name of a county, a river, and a mountain range, and the school has tried to prevent other entities from using this word. For example, Allegheny objected in 2006 when Penn State tried to rename one of its campuses &quot;Allegheny&quot;. Allegheny president Richard Cook said 'Allegheny' was &quot;our brand.&quot;</p>
<p>[[File:Inside Ford Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|alt=picture of the inside of a church|Inside Ford Chapel. While the college has been affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]] since 1833, it is non-sectarian.]] Allegheny under president Richard J. Cook was reported to have had a &quot;stronger endowment, optimal enrollment, record retention rates, innovative new programs and many physical campus improvements.&quot; In February 2008, James H. Mullen Jr. was named the 21st president of Allegheny. He took office Aug. 1, 2008.</p>
<p>The college and the town cooperate in many ways. One study suggested the Allegheny College generates approximately $93 million annually into Meadville and the local economy. Since 2002, Allegheny hosts classical music festivals during the summer. In July 2007, a 1,500-pound <a>wrecking ball</a> demolishing part of Allegheny's Pelletier library broke its chain, rumbled down the hill, careened &quot;back and forth across the street,&quot; hit nine parked cars, wrecked curbs, and crashed into the trunk of an Allegheny student's car, pushing his car into two cars in front of him. Eight soccer balls in his car &quot;likely lessened the impact of the wrecking ball,&quot; and possibly spared his life, according to a police officer on the scene. The student body voted to name the library's coffee shop &quot;The Wrecking Ball&quot; after the event.</p>
<p>The college has sponsored panels on unusual topics such as <a>face transplant</a>s (2009). Allegheny professors have joined highly visible initiatives; for example, Allegheny professor Michael Maniates, described as the &quot;nation's leading authority on the politics of consumption,&quot; joined the board of a project about the twenty-minute film <em><a>The Story of Stuff</a></em> by filmmaker <a>Annie Leonard</a>, and generated headlines. Dr. Maniates said &quot;We really need to think of ways of making it possible for people to think about working less and getting by on less.&quot; At present, environmental concerns are important at Allegheny, which in 2008 worked with <a>Siemens</a> to devise a &quot;total energy use reduction plan&quot; for the college.</p>

<h3>Requirements for degrees</h3>
<p>Allegheny insists students choose a minor as well as a major A student's major can be in the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences, but that student's minor must be in a different division than his or her major. Another graduate studied both English and bioethics at Allegheny, and became a lawyer at Bayer corporation helping to work on ethics and compliance issues.

There is some debate at Allegheny about requiring scientific-related coursework and whether there should be an emphasis on &quot;<a>scientific literacy</a>&quot;. Students whose grade point averages slip below 2.0 for any particular semester are usually given a notice that their academic standing is in jeopardy; two consecutive semesters with GPAs below 2.0 result in dismissal in most circumstances, according to Ann Sheffield of the Registrar's Office.</p>
<p>Allegheny freshmen and sophomores are required to take seminar courses called &quot;FS&quot; which encourage reading, listening, thinking, writing, speaking, and research skills. In addition, students must take at least two courses (8 semester credit hours) in a discipline other than their major or minor. and <a>Jefferson Medical College</a>. Allegheny offers pre-professional programs in law and health.

Ninety percent of faculty have terminal degrees in their respective fields. Faculty actively publish on a wide range of subjects from the biology of woodpeckers, to structural features of ribosomal RNA, to freshwater invertebrates.</p>
