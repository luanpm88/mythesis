<h2>Board of trustees</h2>
<p>The University of Massachusetts is governed by a lay Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees functions as a legislative body dealing mainly with questions of policy. The Board is not an administrative or management board. In certain rare instances when required by the Massachusetts General Laws, it may function as an appeal body. The Board establishes the general policies governing the University, but has delegated many powers to the President and, through the President, to campus administrators for day-to-day-operations.</p>
<h3>Composition of the Board</h3>
<p>The founding Board had fourteen appointed members and four ex officio members. Formerly, Trustees were appointed by the Legislature or the Board itself; currently, members are appointed by the Governor. The size of the Board has fluctuated between twelve and twenty-four members. The current Board is composed of nineteen voting members and three ex officio non-voting members. Seventeen Board members are appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth; at least five of those appointed must be alumni of the University and one must be a representative of organized labor. The other two voting members are students.</p>
<p>Overall, the board has five student members, elected for one-year terms, from the Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell and Worcester campuses. Voting membership rotates among the campuses: two students are voting members and three others are ex officio non-voting members.</p>

<h2>In popular culture</h2>
<p>&quot;<strong>U-Mass</strong>&quot; is the name of a song on the <a>Pixies</a>' album <em><a>Trompe le Monde</a></em>., a scathing put down of the university that band member and main songwriter <a>Frank Black</a> and guitarist <a>Joey Santiago</a> had attended (but dropped out).</p>
<h2>Mascots</h2>
<p>The original UMass Amherst mascot was the Redmen. Because this name had the potential to offend Native American groups, the mascot was changed in the 1970s to the Minutemen. For the same reason the UMass Lowell mascot was changed from the Chiefs to the River Hawks in the mid-1990s.</p>
