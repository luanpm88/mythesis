<h2>International focus</h2>
<p>UTAS is truly an international university working out of Tasmania. While it maintains a strongly Tasmanian identity, its programs and research are genuinely international in vision and standards. The trend towards globalisation has largely defeated the isolation traditionally associated with an antipodean location. UTAS now plays a major role in helping Tasmania meet the challenge of internationalisation, maintaining a vision set on international rather than regional horizons. At UTAS there are staff and students from more than 70 countries. The University values the presence of its international students and is proud of the services it is able to offer them. Special academic and English-language support is available, along with extensive social assistance, including help in finding accommodation and information about Australian society. Formal links with other universities outside Australia bear witness to the University of Tasmania&#x2019;s international standard and reputation. The University now has a large number of links and associations in Asia, as well as North America, the UK and Europe.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h4>Student Unionism</h4>
<p> Until 2008, there were two separate student unions the <a>Tasmania University Union</a> (TUU) in <a>Hobart</a> and the Student Association (SA) in <a>Launceston</a>. Due to the abolition of <a>compulsory student unionism</a> in 2007, the SA and the TUU amalgamated into one Statewide Organisation representing all UTAS students.</p>
<p>The President of the TUU is elected to represent all UTAS students on all campuses, and both Hobart and Launceston have their own Vice-President and Student Representative Councils. Both the TUU State President and TUU State Postgraduate sit on University Council, which is the governing body of the University of Tasmania. </p>
<p>The TUU is responsible for the overseeing of all the university&#x2019;s many sports clubs and societies. Some of these include faculty-based societies, such as the Law Students, Medical Students and Engineering Students societies; societies related to various interests, such as PLoT (Produces Lots of Theatre), The Anime Society; and various sporting clubs, including white water rafting, soccer, hockey, Touch Football,  Australian Rules football, <a>Rugby Union</a>.</p>
<h4>Residential Colleges</h4>
<p>The university maintains a strong residential college system. A key aspect of campus life, the residential colleges are equipped with modern facilities and host several events during the semesters. The colleges also maintain their respective student clubs, key in the passing of traditions from one cohort to the next. The southern colleges annually compete in a series of sporting events including <a>Rugby</a>, <a>Australian Football</a>, <a>Cricket</a>, <a>Softball</a>, <a>Basketball</a>, <a>Table Tennis</a>, <a>Tennis</a> and <a>Soccer</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Tasmania Scholarships</h2>
<p>The Tasmania Scholarships program supports the University&#x2019;s commitment to offer students an exemplary learning environment. It attracts talented students, both locally, nationally and internationally. Industry contributions now make up the backbone of the Tasmania Scholarships program. The development and growth of this initiative into one of the most successful sponsored programs in the country is exceptional by any standard. Around 10 per cent of all domestic students at UTAS receive some sort of scholarship or financial assistance.</p>
