<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Lincoln University library.</a> Lincoln University began life in 1878 as a School of Agriculture.  From 1896 to 1961 it served students under the name &quot;Canterbury Agricultural College&quot;, and offered qualifications of the <a>University of New Zealand</a> until that institution's demise. From 1961 to 1990, it was known as Lincoln College, a constituent college of the <a>University of Canterbury</a>, until achieving autonomy in 1990 as Lincoln University. It is the oldest <a>agricultural</a> teaching institution in the <a>Southern Hemisphere</a>. It remains the smallest university in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In March 2009 <a>AgResearch</a> announced that it planned to merge with Lincoln University, an idea that was later scaled back to &quot;sharing of knowledge&quot;.</p>
