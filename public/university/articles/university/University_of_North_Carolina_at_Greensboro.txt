<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|350px|right|North Carolina State Normal and Industrial College, ca. 1906.</a></p>
<p>Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a <a>women's college</a> by legislative enactment on February 18, 1891 as the <strong>State Normal and Industrial School</strong> and opened October 5, 1892. The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original  site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.</p>
<p>The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the &quot;State Normal and Industrial School&quot; to the <strong>State Normal and Industrial College</strong> in 1896, and again in 1919 to <strong>North Carolina College for Women</strong>. In 1932, it changed to the <strong>Woman's College of the University of North Carolina</strong>, when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to the <strong>University of North Carolina at Greensboro</strong> when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as &quot;the W.C.&quot;</p>
<p>Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|170px|left|The Fountain in front of the Dining Halls</a></p>
<p>UNCG has an architecturally diverse campus with distinctively unique landmarks. Historic structures include the Foust Building (1891), Spencer Hall (1904, 1907), the Quad (1919&#x2013;1923), the Chancellor's Residence (1923), Aycock Auditorium (1927), and Alumni House (1937).  Other features include a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.</p>
<p>Other landmarks include &quot;Charlie,&quot; a statue of the University's founder <a>Charles Duncan McIver</a> outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to &quot;the Rawk&quot; and the clock tower&mdash;two campus landmarks&mdash;and school traditions (<em>See Traditions below</em>). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed in 2005.</p>
<p>The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and &quot;the Caf,&quot; the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.</p>
<p>The campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities &mdash; <a>North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University</a>, <a>Duke</a>, <a>Elon</a>, <a>High Point University</a>, <a>NC State</a>, <a>UNC-Chapel Hill</a>, <a>UNC Charlotte</a>, <a>Wake Forest</a>, and <a>Winston-Salem State University</a>.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where &quot;The Rawk&quot; and the clock tower are located.</p>
<h4>The Rawk</h4>
<p>The Rawk is a large boulder donated by members of <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.</p>
<p>The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's &quot;Rawkin' Welcome Week,&quot; which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.</p>
<h4>Clock Towers</h4>
<p>Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.</p>
<p>Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.</p>
<p>A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the <a>Big Ben</a> chimes.</p>
<h4>Other traditions</h4>
<p>It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisy&mdash;the school flower of UNCG&mdash;after student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 &quot;to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms.&quot;) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.</p>
<p>Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.</p>

<p>&lt;li&gt;Disseminate program and admission information to prospective students&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Collect and process application materials submitted to The University&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Coordinate the admission process with academic departments&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Assist students with interpretation of policy, course registration and withdrawal&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Monitor academic eligibility&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Review theses/dissertations for formatting requirements&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Process applications for Graduation&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Process degree audits/degree clearances&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Work with the Graduate Studies Committee to approve all new/revised graduate programs, curricula, and policy</p>
<h4>M.F.A. Writing Program</h4>
<p>The MFA Writing Program is one of the oldest such programs in the country. During the early years, the University had among its faculty a number of noted writers, such as <a>Allen Tate</a>, <a>Caroline Gordon</a>,  <a>John Crowe Ransom</a>, <a>Hiram Haydn</a>, <a>Peter Taylor</a>, <a>Robie Macauley</a> and <a>Randall Jarrell</a>.
