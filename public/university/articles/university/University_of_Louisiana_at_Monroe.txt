<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Teams participate in <a>NCAA</a> Division I (<a>Division I FBS</a> for <a>football</a>). ULM joined the <a>Sun Belt Conference</a> for all sports on July 1, 2006 after playing in the <a>Southland Conference</a> in all sports except football (swimming and diving team was in Sun Belt Conference, but was dropped in 2005).  </p>
<p>ULM moved from Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) to Division I-A (now FBS) in 1994 and played as a I-A independent 1994-2000. Became a football-only Sun Belt Conference member in 2001 and joined as a member in all sports in 2006. ULM shared the 2005 Sun Belt Conference football championship with <a>Arkansas State University</a> and the <a>University of Louisiana-Lafayette</a> (ASU received the conference's <a>New Orleans Bowl</a> bid due to tiebreaking procedures). </p>
<p>ULM basketball coaches have included <a>Arnold R. Kilpatrick</a>, <a>Lenny Fant</a> (1957&#x2013;1979) and Mickael E. &quot;Mike&quot; Vining. Fant was the first ULM coach to win three hundred games.</p>
<p>The university is home to several award-winning groups including the <a>Sound of Today</a> and the competition cheerleading squad. The ULM water ski team is the most successful in the history of collegiate <a>water skiing</a>, having won 22 NCWSA national championships since 1979. Bayou DeSiard was the host site of the first national championships in that year.</p>
<p>The football and <a>baseball</a> stadiums and ULM Activities Center were designed by <a>architect</a> <a>Hugh G. Parker</a> of <a>Bastrop</a>. </p>
<p>In just three seasons in the Sun Belt, the Warhawks have won conference titles in men's basketball (2006-07 West Co-Champion) and baseball (2008 regular season).  </p>
<p>The ULM football team posted its first six-win season since moving to Division I-A in 2007 going 6-6, which included a 21-14 victory at Alabama.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumbnail|200px|ULM Warhawks</a></p>
<p>The 75-year-old &quot;Indians&quot; mascot was retired because of NCAA restrictions against <a>American Indian</a>-themed mascots, considered &quot;hostile and abusive&quot; to <a>Native Americans</a>. A mascot committee selected <em>Warhawks</em> in 2006  honoring Maj. Gen. <a>Claire Lee Chennault</a>'s <a>Air Force</a> <a>World War II</a> unit's <a>Curtiss P-40</a> Warhawk, although the logos primarily use bird imagery.</p>
