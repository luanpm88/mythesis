<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|250px|right|Making &quot;History&quot; as the new McMurran Hall is opened on the night of Monday, January 4th, 2010</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>In 1960 the city of Newport News joined together with the <a>Commonwealth of Virginia</a> to create Christopher Newport College(CNC), which opened its doors in 1961 and at the time was located in the old <a>John W. Daniel</a> School building.  The college was founded as an extension of the <a>College of William &amp; Mary</a> and offered extension courses that had already been available in the area for some time.  In 1964 the college was relocated to its current location, a  tract of land purchased and donated by the city.  In this same year, the college's first permanent building was dedicated as <a>Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr.</a> Hall, named after the assemblyman whose sponsored legislation led to the schools establishment.  In 1971, CNC became a 4 year college  Finally in 1992, the college received university status under the leadership of then president Anthony R. Santoro who oversaw the building of the first residence hall and the original Captain John Smith Library.  Eventually former senator <a>Paul S. Trible</a> replaced Santoro as president of the university, after which the former senator announced his plans for the university's expansion.</p>

<p>Forbes ranks CNU #4 for &quot;Best colleges for minorities in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).&quot; </p>
<h3>Academic Programs</h3>
<p>Christopher Newport University offers a variety of four year bachelors of sciences and bachelors of arts degrees.  For a few of these degrees they offer a masters in 5 program which, with an additional year of study, will allow graduation with a masters of science or masters of arts in the selected field.  Along with the choice of a major, many students will choose a minor with which to complement their education.  They also offer several Pre-professional programs and Certificate programs. The campus academic programs are divided into the Joseph W. Luter III School of Business and the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences.  Each of these departments is broken down further into the academic programs that they offer.</p>
<h3>Joseph W. Luter III College of Business and Leadership</h3>
<p>The College of Business is located in the Business and Technology Center, locally abbreviated as The BTC Building.  Here you will find administrative and faculty offices for the department, as well as classrooms and computer labs.  In 2005 the school of business was renamed to the <a>Joseph W. Luter III</a> School of Business.  The school was renamed after a 5 million dollar donation from the <a>Smithfield Packing Company</a>.  <a>Joseph W. Luter, III</a>, the president and CEO of the company at the time said, &quot;I have always felt strongly about the importance of contributing to the community and to the people with whom we come into contact every day. ..I have always encouraged <a>Smithfield Foods</a>, Inc. and its subsidiaries to focus on helping their local communities in a direct way.&quot;[<a>http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/Enviro/Press/press_view.asp?ID=294</a>] in regards to the companies donation.  In December the Leadership and American Studies Department merged with the School of Business to create the Joseph W Luter III College of Business and Leadership. The College of Business is accredited by the <a>AACSB</a> and offers bachelors degrees in <a>Accounting</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Finance</a>, <a>Management</a> and <a>Marketing</a>.  Worldwide, only one in six business schools has AACSB international accreditation. [<a>http://about.cnu.edu/exceptionalValue/exceptionalValue1.cfm</a>]</p>
<h3>College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences</h3>
<p>The college of <a>Liberal Arts</a> &amp; Sciences is divided into academic departments.  Each academic department is primarily associated with a building on campus.  Most classes within a department will be located in the associated building as well as faculty offices and other learning resources.  The department of Biology, Chemistry &amp; Environmental Science, generally located in the Science Building, offers bachelors degrees in <a>Biology</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Environmental Science</a> and <a>Ornamental Horticulture</a> however the Ornamental Horticulture program was dropped in 2008.  The Physics, Computer Science &amp; Computer Engineering, or PCSE, department offers several bachelors degree as well as a master in 5 programs.  Undergraduate programs include degrees in <a>Computer Engineering</a>, <a>Applied Physics</a>, <a>Computer Science</a> and <a>Information Science</a>.  The Information Science program offers several concentrations which include <a>Networking</a> &amp; <a>Communications</a>, <a>Information Systems</a>, and <a>Business Administration</a>.  With an extra year of study, a student can graduate with their bachelors in Computer Science or Physics as well as a masters in Applied Physics and Computer Science.  Sharing Gosnold Hall with the PCSE Department is the Mathematics Department which offers a degree in <a>Mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>As of January 2010 the Departments of Communication Studies, English, History, Government, Modern and Classical Languages and Literature as well as the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies are located in Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. McMurran is the newest building on campus. The former McMurran Hall has been demolished. The Government department offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in <a>Political Science</a>. The <a>History</a> department offers degrees in History. The <a>English</a> Department offers a lone degree in English. Concentrations include <a>Creative Writing</a>, <a>Journalism</a>, Language Arts, <a>Literature</a>, <a>Technical Writing</a> and <a>Writing</a>.  For languages other than English, the Modern &amp; Classical Languages &amp; Literatures department offers degrees in German, French, Spanish, and Classical Studies. The department of Philosophy and Religious Studies offers a Bachelors of Arts, and includes Religious Studies and Pre-Seminary options for a concentration.</p>
<p>The Psychology and Sociology &amp; Anthropology and Socialwork Departments, offer degrees in <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Social Work</a> and <a>Sociology</a>.  The sociology program also offers options for a concentration with include <a>Criminology</a>, Culture/Socialization/Society and General sociology studies. The psychology program is also especially strong, with many students going on to obtain graduate degrees.</p>
<p>With the addition of the <a>Ferguson Center for the Performing Arts</a>, the schools Fine and Performing arts programs has been greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|250px|left|The Ferguson Center for the Arts</a> --&gt;</p>
<h3>The Department of Fine Art and Art History</h3>
<p>The Fine   Art Department, located in the back of the Ferguson Center, offers a degree in <a>Fine Arts</a> with concentrations in <a>Art History</a> and <a>Studio Art</a>.  However, it should be known that by keeping the department &quot;liberal&quot;, concentrations which are available at many other institutions, do not exist at CNU. For instance, as a Fine Arts major, one either chooses Studio Art or Art History. Under the Studio concentration, one will take courses ranging from 2-D and 3-D Design, painting, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, pottery, photography, crafts, and/or computer art. There are no concentrations in any particular field which can create some difficulties when transitioning from undergraduate to graduate studies. To make up for the lack of concentrations, students in their senior year are required to take the Senior Seminar course in which they create a large body of work in their own &quot;specialty.&quot; The professors are all very approachable, readily available, and for the most part, strive to be a part of each student's creation process.</p>
<h3>The Department of Theatre &amp; Dance</h3>
<p>The department that, perhaps, gained the most value from the addition of the Ferguson center is the Theatre &amp; Dance Department.  The department offers a degree in <a>Theater Arts</a> with concentrations in <a>Acting</a>, Arts Administration, Design/Technology, Directing/Dramatic Literature and Music/Dance.</p>
<h3>The Department of Music</h3>
<p>Dr. Mark Reimer chairs the Department of Music at CNU. If looking for something other than a science or arts degree, the school also offers a Bachelors of Music degree.  This degree can be complemented with concentrations in Jazz Studies, History/Literature, Music Education both Instrumental and Choral, Performance and <a>Theory</a>/<a>Composition</a>.</p>
<h3>Jazz Studies</h3>
<p>In April 2009 jazz small group 'combo 1' was selected to compete at the North Texas Jazz Festival and was recognized for outstanding musicianship. This group included: Brittany Burrell, vocals; Jason Hammers, tenor saxophone; Matt Stern, piano; Jaison Wynne, bass; and Joe Hamm, drums. Jason Hammers was recognized as an outstanding soloist.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Statue of Sir Christopher Newport</a></p>
<h3>Boundaries</h3>
<p>The traditional boundaries of the Christopher Newport University campus have been Warwick Boulevard, Shoe Lane, and Prince Drew Road in Newport News. In recent years, however, the University has &quot;jumped&quot; Warwick Boulevard, buying and demolishing properties in the immediate area to expand.  The part of campus that is east of Warwick Boulevard is referred to as &quot;East Campus&quot; and is primarily used to house upper-class students.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>Residence halls on campus are usually segregated into the class of student living in them.  In the recent years, new policies have been enacted that require all freshman and sophomore students to live in an on campus housing facility, unless they live in the commuting zone.</p>
<p><strong>Freshman housing</strong></p>
<p>The oldest housing facility on campus is <strong>Santoro Hall</strong> which opened in 1994 and was named after Carol and Anthony Santoro.  This building is directly adjacent to one of the campus dining facilities, the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Santoro Hall, along with the newer York River Hall, is primarily used for freshman housing. <strong>York River Hall</strong> was opened for occupancy in 2002. This complex, dived into two buildings (York River East/ York River West), houses over 500 students and is the largest residence hall on campus. Both Santoro and York River Halls are suite-living residence halls. In each building, pairs of neighboring housing units share a common private restroom. Freshman also live in portions of <strong>Potomac Hall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Upperclassmen housing</strong></p>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|James River Hall after a January snow</a> Sophomore housing currently consists of <strong>James River Hall</strong>, opened in 2000, as well as half of Potomac Hall, opened in 2004. James River Hall boasts a variety of floor plans, including 4,5, and 6-person apartments, 4-person suites, and three 15-person Theme Units. Potomac Hall, like York River Hall, is divided into two buildings (North/ South), and consists of suites of two bedrooms, located around a central living room and bath.</p>
<p>Juniors and Seniors living on campus are relegated to East Campus, the home for all upperclassmen at CNU. Starting in 2009, five sororities and four fraternities live in <strong>Barclay Apartments</strong>, CNU's temporary Greek Village. Completed in 2002, <strong>CNU Apartments</strong> is a complex of five buildings of three or four stories, housing up to 355 students. These buildings, named after Virginia-born presidents, include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Harrison, and Monroe. The <strong>CNU Village</strong> rose to accompany CNU Apartments in 2005, adding room for an additional 398 students in apartment living. Both the apartments and the Village feature 2 to 4 single bedroom apartments with a common living area (full kitchen, living room/dinette, washer and dryer). Below CNU Village, along Warwick Blvd., are a variety of eating establishments including Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Subway, Sushi &amp; Spice, and Schooners, opened by three local restaurateurs who wanted to fill a void left by the lack of a social outlet on campus.</p>
<h3>Dining facilities</h3>
<p>The campus has 2 major dining facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Hiden-Hussey Commons</strong></p>
<p>The first dining facility on campus was originally named Harbour Lights.  This all you can eat cafeteria style facility is decorated internally with nautical memorbalia to go along with its name.  In 2005 Harbour Lights was renamed to the Hiden Hussey Commons.  Newer students just refer to it as &quot;The Commons.&quot;  Even with its new name, some students still refer to it as &quot;Harbour.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Regattas</strong></p>
<p>Regattas Restaurant is the newest addition to the CNU dining facilities.  Opened in 2002, it shares a similar format to the Hiden Hussey Commons with the all-you-can-eat cafeteria style but sports a more up-tempo environment with newer chairs and tables and often featuring hand made waffle cones for ice cream and custom made omelettes. It has recently been moved into the new multi-million dollar <a>Student Union</a>.</p>
<h3>The David Student Union</h3>
<p><a>thumb|300px|left|The David Student Union</a> <a>thumb|right|Main Corridor of the &quot;DSU&quot;</a> The David Student Union, or the DSU as it is sometimes called, is a new, $36 million, . facility whose construction began in 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a &quot;Neo-<a>Georgian</a>&quot; architectural style, the first floor, the campus Bookstore and Convenience Store parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Sweet Street, <a>Chick-fil-A</a>, Stone Willy's <a>Pizza</a>, and Regatta's. Additionally, Captain's Cards can be received at the Information Desk.  All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full-service Post Office located on the second floor of the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at the top of the steps. The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain's Log, Career Development, International Studies, Academic Advising, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David.</p>
<h3>Academic buildings</h3>
<p>For the opening of the Spring 2010 semester, Christopher Newport University opened the newly completed Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. This building has combined timeless neo-Georgian architecture with 21st century technology. The largest academic building currently at CNU (85,000 sq. feet), the building will frame the university's emerging Great Lawn on its western side. McMurran Hall houses the Departments of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, History, English, and Government. It boasts a 150-person lecture hall, two 50-person lecture halls, and over 25 other state-of-the-art classrooms.</p>
<p>To the north of McMurran Hall is Ratcliffe Hall, the former home of the Departments of English and Government. Once CNU's gymnasium, the building was renovated to include classroom and office space for students and faculty. Other academic buildings on campus include Gosnold Hall (The home of the Physics,Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Mathematics departments), Wingfield Hall (The home of the Psychology and Language departments), and the Business and Technology Center (BTC Building), located across Prince Drew Lane. The BTC Building is the current home of the Joseph W. Luter School of Business faculty and classrooms. Finally, the <a>Ferguson Center</a> for the Arts is home to the Departments of Music and Theater &amp; Dance.</p>
<p>Slated for eventual demolition, Wingfield Hall and Gosnold Hall will soon be replaced by new academic buildings. Wingfield Hall will be demolished in 2011 to make way for the Joseph W. Luter Hall, home of the school of business as well as computer science. In Christopher Newport University's long term plans, Gosnold Hall will be demolished to make way for an addition science building, accompanying the science building currently being constructed on the north-western side of the Great Lawn.</p>
<h3>The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|250px|left|The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>The library, renamed for Rosemary and <a>Paul S. Trible, Jr.</a>, had a multi-million dollar addition completed in early 2008. The new 110,000sq.ft. facility houses most of its collection in the original section. The new library opened at the start of the Spring 2008 semester, and boasts a new Einstein's Cafe.  The library is topped by a 14-story cupola, which is inaccessible.  The interior of the cupola is also not visible, as there is a three story dome roof inside the building blocking the view. The building was dedicated on January 24, 2008. In early 2009, the <a>Mariners' Museum</a> Library relocated to the Paul and Rosemary Trible library, providing students and the community with convenient access to the largest maritime history collection in the Western Hemisphere.[<a>http://www.mariner.org/library/about-library</a>]</p>
<h3>Ferguson Center for the Arts</h3>
<p>In just six years, Christopher Newport University&#x2019;s Ferguson Center for the Arts has become an international force, presenting the finest cultural attractions in the world. Close to 1 million people from around the nation have experienced hundreds of performances in our acoustically-superb theatres.  CNU's 2010-2011 5th Anniversary season features more than 30 of the finest artists and touring productions offering a variety of entertainment, including comedy, jazz, country, magic, orchestras, Broadway stars and more.</p>
<h3>Future Construction</h3>
<p>Recently, the President's Office released a statement unveiling plans for future construction on the campus. Design work on the science building is underway.  This project consists of  of new construction and  of renovation to the existing science building.  We are hopeful that construction will begin fall 2009 and the new building will be completed spring 2011 and the renovation of the existing science building will be completed spring 2012.  These buildings will house our programs in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Psychology and will add approximately 60 faculty offices, 10 classrooms, and about 70 new teaching labs and faculty/student research spaces.  This 21st century integrated science center will be located on the Great Lawn, opposite the David Student Union.  One million dollars in state funding has allowed our faculty, led by Faculty Senate President Dr. Gary Whiting, to work with the administration and our architectural and engineering team to design an $81 million facility.  Governor Kaine has included funding for this significant project in his proposed General Obligation Bond for higher education.</p>
<p>The expansion of the Robert L. Freeman Sports and Convocation Center is also being designed.  It is estimated that this building will include  of new construction to include doubling the size of the Trieshmann Health and Fitness Pavilion, providing offices for the Department of Counseling Services and University Health Services, adding an auxiliary gymnasium and constructing a replacement to Gaines Theater with a new, 400 seat auditorium and an array of meeting rooms for student activities.  Construction will begin in the next academic year and will be completed summer 2010.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the former Rector of CNU, Dr. Chip Trieshmann, committed $100,000 toward the establishment of a university chapel. The construction of a chapel is several years away and private funds must be raised to build this facility.</p>
<p>A new residential village is also in the very early stages of design. It is envisioned to include a series of houses joined by a colonnade and should accommodate approximately 200 students.  The location for this project will be  adjacent to the Freeman Center and the Administration Building next to Wise Woods.  It is hoped that this new complex can be completed by fall 2010.</p>
