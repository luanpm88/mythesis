<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|KTB ()</a> The University of Gothenburg was founded as <em>G&#x00f6;teborgs h&#x00f6;gskola</em> (Gothenburg University College) in 1891. In 1907 it was granted the same status as <a>Uppsala University</a> and <a>Lund University</a> by the Swedish government. Over the course of time, it has merged with a number of previously independent academic institutions in the city. It was granted the rights of a full university by the Swedish government in 1954, following the merger of the <em>G&#x00f6;teborgs h&#x00f6;gskola</em> with the <em>Medicinh&#x00f6;gskolan i G&#x00f6;teborg</em> (Gothenburg Medical School), thus becoming Sweden's third-oldest university. </p>
<p>In 1971, the originally separate <a>Gothenburg School of Economics and Commercial Law</a> became part of the University of Gothenburg. <a>Sahlgrenska University Hospital</a> is associated with the university as a teaching hospital.</p>
<p>In the 1990s the <em>School of Economics</em> and the <em>Academy of Music, Drama and Opera</em> have moved to new buildings in the city centre. A new campus for the <em>Faculty of Education</em> (teacher training) was opened in central Gothenburg in 2006.</p>
<p>The University of Gothenburg is a pronounced city university, that is most of its facilities are within the city centre of <a>Gothenburg</a>. The main building as well as most faculties are located in the central part of Gothenburg.</p>
