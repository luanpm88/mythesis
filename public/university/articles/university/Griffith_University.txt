<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1965, 174 hectares of natural bushland at <a>Nathan</a> were set aside for a new campus. By 1970, a new institution was being mooted. The university was formally founded in 1971 and opened its doors in 1975 to 451 students in four schools: Australian Environmental Studies, Humanities, Modern Asian Studies and Science. The University started with its Nathan campus, and several of its campuses are distinctive for their nature based settings within large urban agglomerations. Buildings were designed to fit into the environment by following the slope of the land and by using architectural means of cooling.</p>

<h2>Sporting, social and cultural</h2>
<p>Griffith University has a wide array of cultural, intellectual, sporting and social groups. Its Student Guild is an organisation within the university which takes care of these clubs on the Gold Coast campus, as well as student issues, accommodation, employment, publication, events, sport and recreation.</p>
<p>On the Nathan campus,  Campus Life supports many clubs including the long running GRUBS (Griffith University Bushwalking Club), The Karate and Kickboxing club and the Griffith University <a>Aikido</a> Club, recently incorporated and independent of the University. The Griffith University <a>Rugby Union</a> Club, established by Phil Verheijen in 2002, were runners up in the Northern University Games in 2005 and are consistently ranked in the top 6 at <a>Australian University Games</a>.

The Griffith University Gladiators finished runners up in two of their first five seasons in the AFLSQ. The club plays out of Griffith's Nathan Campus, which features one of Queensland's leading amateur Australian football grounds with state-of-the-art playing lights and club rooms. </p>
<h2>Student Union and representation</h2>
<p>Griffith University students are uniquely represented by two statutory embedded student organisations. The Griffith University Student Representative Council (GUSRC) represents undergraduate students and the Griffith University Postgraduate Students Association (GUPSA) represents post-graduate students in all campuses apart from the Gold Coast. GUPSA is a constituent member of the <a>Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations</a>. Unique to the Gold Coast is the Student Guild (GUSG) which represents all students from this campus and holds an administrative structure that is apparently independent to the university. Griffith also has a significant representation of foreign students.  Many (from the US or other Western nations) come for just one or two semesters, others for a longer period of time.</p>
