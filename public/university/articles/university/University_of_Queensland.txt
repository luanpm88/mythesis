<p> <strong>The University of Queensland</strong>, also known as <strong>UQ</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Brisbane</a>, <a>Australia</a>. Founded in 1909, it is the oldest university in <a>Queensland</a> and the fifth in the nation. The main campus is located in <a>St Lucia</a>, southwest of the <a>Brisbane CBD</a>. UQ is a member of the Australia's <a>Group of Eight</a> lobby group, and the <a>Universitas 21</a>, an international network of research-intensive universities, and is colloquially known as a &quot;<a>sandstone university</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>UQ is ranked among the top universities, both in Australia and the world.  In 2009, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation reported that UQ have taken the lead in numerous areas of cancer research, having awarded almost $10 million in grants over a three year period.</p>
<p>There are numerous collaborative research centres associated with the university. The Queensland Bioscience Precinct on the <a>St Lucia</a> campus houses scientists from the <a>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) and the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB). The Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology and the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) are located close by and together these institutes form one of the largest biomedical research clusters in Australia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Construction of the Forgan Smith Building began in 1938</a> The University of Queensland (UQ) was established on 10 December 1909  by the <a>Queensland Parliament</a> to mark the 50th anniversary of Queensland&#x2019;s independence from <a>New South Wales</a>. The University's first classes in the Government house were held in 1911, with 83 commencing students. The development of the University was delayed by <a>World War I</a>, but after the first world war the university enrollments for education and research took flight as demand for <a>higher education</a> increased in Australia. Thus, in the early 1920s the growing University had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site at George Street, <a>Brisbane</a> has limited room for expansion.</p>
<p>In 1927, Dr James O&#x2019;Neil Mayne and his sister <a>Mary Emelia Mayne</a>, provided a grant of approximately &#x00a3;50,000 to the <a>Brisbane City Council</a> to acquire  of land at St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home. In 2010, <a>QS World University Rankings</a> placed the university in 43rd (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities also placed UQ among the top 10 universities in the Asia Pacific Region.</p>
<p>The following publications <a>ranked universities</a> worldwide. The University of Queensland ranked: </p>
<h2>Academia and Research</h2>
<p>UQ research led by Professor <a>Ian Frazer</a> pioneered a <a>vaccine for cervical cancer</a>. The vaccine <a>Gardasil</a> protects against an approximate 70 percent of human papillomavirus-related cervical cancers. Previously, more than 270,000 women died from the disease each year.</p>
<p>In 2009, UQ researchers led by Professor Scott O'Neill successfully infected <a>aedes</a> mosquito with a bacterium that halves the mosquitoes 30-day lifespan, thereby reducing its ability to transmit <a>dengue fever</a> to humans. The international research team at UQ was funded by a $9 million donation from the <a>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>HyShot</a> Flight Program which involves the world's first flight tests of a scramjet using supersonic combustion was designed by UQ.</p>

<h3>St Lucia campus</h3>
<p>UQ was established on 10 December 1909, with Sir <a>William MacGregor</a> as first chancellor (with <a>Reginald Heber Roe</a> as vice-chancellor) and was originally situated in Brisbane's downtown area on <a>George Street</a>. This central semi-circular quadrangle features a connected arcade so students could reach any section under cover.</p>
<p>The  also includes sporting fields, gardens, duckponds, and cycling tracks. The athletics centre features 21 floodlit tennis courts and Olympic-standard swimming pool, a three-level gymnasium and a multi-purpose indoor centre. </p>
<p>The university is served by a <a>CityCat wharf</a>, two <a>bus stations</a> and is also served by the <a>Eleanor Schonell Bridge</a> providing pedestrian and bus access across the river to <a>Dutton Park</a>.</p>
<p>2009 saw the opening of the $2.5 million Advanced Concepts Teaching Space (ACTS) lecture theatre which enable students to use mobile technology to aid classroom learning.</p>
<h3>Gatton campus</h3>
<p>Located in <a>Gatton, Queensland</a> about 90&nbsp;km west of Brisbane on the Warrego Highway. UQ Gatton, formerly the Queensland Agricultural College, was opened in 1897 as a combined agricultural college and experimental farm. Courses offered include: arts, business and social sciences as well as <a>Interaction design</a>. In 2009, a cohort of 39 students became the pioneers to undertake medicine at the Ipswich campus.</p>
<p>It is located near central <a>Ipswich, Queensland</a>, just south of the CBD. Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, <a>The Workshops Railway Museum</a> and the <a>RAAF Base Amberley</a>.</p>
<p>The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum. Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipswich&quot;/&gt; In 1938 it was renamed the Ipswich Mental Hospital and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital. It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of Dr. Henry Challinor, the ships surgeon on the Fortitude. From 1968 to 1997 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with <a>intellectual disabilities</a>. In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipswich&quot;/&gt;</p>
