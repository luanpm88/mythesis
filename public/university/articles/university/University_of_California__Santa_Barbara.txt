<p>The <strong>University of California, Santa Barbara</strong>, commonly known as <strong>UCSB</strong> or <strong>UC Santa Barbara</strong>, is a <a>public</a> research university and one of the 10 general campuses of the <a>University of California</a> system. The main campus is located on a  site in <a>Santa Barbara, California</a>,  northwest of <a>Los Angeles</a>. Founded in 1909 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the University of California system in 1944 and is the third-oldest general-education campus in the system.</p>
<p>UCSB is a comprehensive doctoral university and is organized into five colleges offering 87 undergraduate degrees and 55 graduate degrees. The campus is the 5th-largest in the UC system by enrollment with 18,429 undergraduate and 2,981 graduate students. The university granted 5,442 bachelor's, 576 master's, and 310 Ph.D. degrees in 2006-2007. The four-year, full-time undergraduate program is classified by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> as &quot;more selective, higher transfer-in&quot;. In 2010, UCSB was ranked 39th among &quot;National Universities&quot; by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> , 29th worldwide by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and 32nd worldwide by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>
<p>UC Santa Barbara is a &quot;very high activity&quot; research university and spent $191.2 million on research expenditures in the 2007 fiscal year, 97th-largest in the United States. UCSB houses twelve national research centers, including the <a>Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>, <a>Southern California Earthquake Center</a>, and <a>Materials Research Laboratory</a>. UCSB faculty includes five <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates, one <a>Fields Medalist</a>, 29 members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>, 27 members of the <a>National Academy of Engineering</a>, and 23 members of the <a>American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. UCSB was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1995. UCSB was the #3 host on the <a>ARPAnet</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>UC Santa Barbara Gauchos</a> compete in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> <a>Big West Conference</a>. The Gauchos have won NCAA national championships in men's soccer and men's water polo.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>UCSB traces its origins back to the Ida Blake School which was founded in 1891 and offered training in home economics and industrial arts. The Ida Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School. In 1921, a liberal arts program was authorized and the school was renamed again to <a>Santa Barbara State College</a>. Intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara, led by <a>Thomas Storke</a> and Pearl Chase, persuaded the State Legislature, Governor <a>Earl Warren</a>, and the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system in 1944. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the Governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed, however, to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses.</p>
<p>Originally, the Regents envisioned a small, several thousand-student liberal arts college, a so-called <code><a>Williams College</a> of the West,' at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is only the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the Regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only  of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa, however. The availability of a  ex-<a>Marine</a> Base on another seaside mesa in <a>Goleta</a>, which the Regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. Originally, only 3000-3500 students were anticipated, but the post WWII <a>baby boom</a> led to the designation of general campus in 1958, along with a name change from &quot;Santa Barbara College&quot; to &quot;University of California, Santa Barbara,&quot; and the discontinuation of the industrial arts program for which the State college was famous. A <a>Chancellor</a>, Samuel B. Gould, was appointed in 1959. All of this change was done in accordance with the <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a>.</code></p>
<p>UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti-Vietnam War activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Other than <a>UC Berkeley</a>, no other California college received as much attention from the national media for its antiwar activities. Events during the era included a bombing at the school's faculty club in 1969 (which killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp) and the spring 1970 burning of the <a>Bank of America</a> branch building in the student community of <a>Isla Vista</a>,  during which time one male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed, though the investigation ruled it an accident.   This UCSB student shooting did not receive a lot of media attention as it was overshadowed by the subsequent shootings on the campus of  <a>Kent State</a> in Ohio.   In addition, part of  UCSB's anti-Vietnam activity impelled then Governor <a>Ronald Reagan</a> to impose a <a>curfew</a> and order  the <a>National Guard</a> to enforce it.  Weapon-carrying guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this time. A number of noteworthy anti-war speakers made UCSB a key stop on national speaking tours in the early 1970s.  Among them were <a>Jesse Jackson</a>, <a>Ralph Abernathy</a>, <a>Tom Hayden</a>, <a>Abbie Hoffman</a>, <a>Eldridge Cleaver</a>, <a>Eugene McCarthy</a>, <a>William Kunstler</a>, <a>Angela Davis</a>, and <a>George McGovern</a>. In a later era, <a>John Anderson</a>, <a>Jesse Jackson</a>, and <a>Hillary Clinton</a> were the Presidential candidates to speak at the school.</p>
<p>UCSB was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1995.</p>

<p><a>Santa Barbara State College</a> was under the supervision of a <a>President</a>, but in 1944, when it became a campus of the <a>University of California</a>, the title of the chief executive was changed to <a>Provost</a>. In September 1958, the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> established Santa Barbara as a general University campus and at the official title of the chief executive was changed to <a>Chancellor</a>. UCSB's first Chancellor was thus <a>Samuel B. Gould</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Ucsbuniversitycenterandstorketower.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Storke Tower]] and the University Center in front of the UCSB Lagoon.]] <a>thumb|right|300px|A view over the school's lagoon to one of the Channel Islands</a> UCSB is located on cliffs directly above the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>. UCSB's campus has not been annexed by the city of <a>Santa Barbara</a> and thus is not technically part of the city. While it appears closer to the recently formed city of <a>Goleta</a>, a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of &quot;city&quot; through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. Like all other UC and CSU campuses, it is self-governing and cannot be incorporated into either city. The campus is divided into four parts: Main campus  that houses all academic units plus the majority of Undergraduate housing, Storke campus, West campus and North Campus. The campuses surround the community of <a>Isla Vista</a>.</p>
<p>UCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline as well as its own lagoon. The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach.</p>
<p>Much of the campus' early architecture was designed by famed architect <a>William Pereira</a> and his partner <a>Charles Luckman</a>, and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings.</p>
<p>The <a>Lagoon</a> is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat and is fed by a combination of run-off and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus, it is a unique combination of fresh and salt water. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer, more modern facilities. The <a>UCSB Libraries</a>, consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than 3 million bound volumes and millions of <a>microform</a>s, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. The 24 Hour Study Room, formerly known as the RBR (Reserved Book Room), is adjacent to the Davidson Library, which is located in the middle of the UCSB campus.</p>
<p>Campbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 860 seats. It is also the main venue for the UCSB Arts and Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community.</p>
<p><a>Storke Tower</a>, completed in 1969, is the tallest building in <a>Santa Barbara County</a>. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. It is home to a five-octave, 61-bell <a>carillon</a>. <a>KCSB 91.9</a> and the <em><a>Daily Nexus</a></em> have headquarters beneath Storke Tower.</p>
<p>The UCSB Family Vacation Center founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>UC Santa Barbara is a large, comprehensive, primarily residential doctoral university.</p>
<p>UCSB hosts 12 National Research Centers, including the <a>Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>, the <a>National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a>, the <a>Southern California Earthquake Center</a>, and the <a>California Nanosystems Institute</a>. Eight of these centers are supported by the National Science Foundation.</p>

<h2>Student activities and traditions</h2>
<p>[[Image:Storke Tower, UCSB.jpg|thumb|[[Storke Tower]]]] </p>
<p></p>
<p>UCSB is also a politically active campus. For the 2008 presidential election, UCSB won a national college competition for student voter registration by registering 10857 voters, or 51.5% of the student population.  The UCSB Campus Democrats are one of the most active organizations on campus. Over the years, other political parties and organizations have also been known to be active on campus, such as the Environmental Affairs Board, <a>Green Party</a>, <a>Libertarians</a>, <a>NORML</a>, and the Queer Student Union. Several presidential and vice presidential candidates have visited the campus in recent years, including <a>Hillary Clinton</a>, <a>John B. Anderson</a> and <a>Peter Camejo</a>. The campus has also seen a resurgence of anti-war sentiment among students. In 2006, for example, a massive student anti-war protest shut down <a>Highway 217</a>, adjacent to the campus. </p>
<p>There are a variety of on campus centers offering social, recreational, religious, and preprofessional activities for students. The UCSB Multicultural Center puts on numerous activities every year to support students of color and promote awareness of diversity issues on campus. Other organizations and centers include the <em><a>Daily Nexus</a></em>, the campus newspaper, the La Cumbre Yearbook, the school radio station, <a>KCSB 91.9</a>, <em>The Bottom Line</em>, an alternative biweekly newspaper, and the Gaucho Free Press, the campus's conservative magazine. The UCSB Recreation Center also hosts a variety of activities, from Adventure Programs to <a>ballroom dancing</a> classes. Further UCSB Hillel offers a space for UCSB's large Jewish population and a place for Jewish students to come together in a unique building in Isla Vista. Students socialize at the <a>Arbor</a>, the <a>UCen</a>, the Coral Tree Cafe the Courtyard Cafe and for a special lunch, the Faculty Club.</p>
<p>UCSB is the only UC campus with its own Paramedic Rescue Unit. It is staffed by full-time professional paramedics and part-time undergraduate <a>EMT</a>s.</p>
<p>SexInfo, which was started in 1976 by Professors John and Janice Baldwin, is run by students doing advanced course work and research on <a>sexuality</a> through UCSB's <a>Sociology</a> Department. The site is dedicated to providing accurate information about sexuality in a way that is both informative and personal. SexInfo answers questions sent in by readers from all over the world, as well as regularly updates and posts articles on various topics related to human sexuality. This program helps students getting their degree in psychology.</p>
<p>UCSB is also known for its annual free music festival, <a>Extravaganza</a>. It is held at Harder Stadium in the spring and generally attracts around 8,000 people. Past performers have included <a>Nas</a>, <a>T.I.</a>, <a>E-40</a>, <a>Sublime</a>, <a>Run-D.M.C.</a>, <a>The Pharcyde</a>, <a>Social Distortion</a>, <a>Jack Johnson</a>, and <a>Drake</a> amongst many others. <img></p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>[[Image:San Nicolas, UCSB.jpg|thumb|right|San Nicolas residence hall.  As of September 2008, six of the on-campus residence halls are named after the islands in the nearby [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] chain.]] <a>thumb|right|De La Guerra dining commons</a></p>
<p>There are 8 <a>residence halls</a> at UCSB, seven of which are located at the Main campus, and one of which, <a>Santa Catalina Dorms</a> (Formerly known as Francisco Torres or FT), is located near the entrance to West campus north of <a>Isla Vista</a>.</p>
<p>Santa Catalina has, not only its own dining commons, Portola Dining Commons, but it has a heated swimming pool, two lounges, numerous study rooms, 2 Recreational Rooms, a gym, as well as tennis courts and an expansive lawn. Because Santa Catalina is nearly 1&nbsp;mi. off-campus it has its own Campus police station as well as housing offices and Res-Net support center.</p>
<p>The Main Campus residence halls are found in two different locations. On the east end of campus are the residence halls named after five of the <a>Channel Islands</a>: <a>Santa Rosa</a>, <a>Santa Cruz</a>, <a>Anacapa</a>, <a>San Miguel</a> and <a>San Nicolas</a>. There are two dining commons located near the Channel Islands residence halls. The Ortega Dining Commons is located between San Miguel and the University Center <a>(UCen)</a>, and the De La Guerra Dining Commons (better known as DLG) is located between Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and San Nicolas.</p>
<p>The two other residence halls, San Rafael and <a>Manzanita Village</a>, are located on the west side of campus and primarily house continuing and transfer students. The Carrillo Dining Commons is located in <a>Manzanita Village</a>, right next to San Rafael Hall. Manzanita Village was completed in 2002, and is the newest residence hall on campus.</p>
<p>In addition the University also has four housing complexes for Graduate students and their families: the recently completed San Clemente Villages for single graduate students, Santa Ynez Apartments, El Dorado Apartments, Westgate Apartments, and family student housing: West Campus Apartments and the Storke Apartment complexes. There is also Faculty Housing at the West Campus Point and new construction underway at the North Campus.</p>
<p>Students may also choose to rent housing in the bordering community of Isla Vista. An estimated average for rent costs is $500&#x2013;$800 US/month to share a bedroom, and includes trash pickup and water utilities. Low-cost housing is limited, with the cheapest source being the <a>Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative</a>.</p>
<p>Other sources of housing include the Greek System, and outlying communities (i.e. Goleta, Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, Montecito). Many students live in Isla Vista, which is immediately adjacent to campus. Isla Vista since the early 1960s has a reputation of being a party environment. UCSB is also affiliated with the <a>Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative</a> in Isla Vista, which seeks to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation, and thereby influencing the community to eliminate prejudice and discrimination in the community.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> The mascot of UCSB is the <a>Gaucho</a> and the school colors are blue and gold. UCSB's sports teams compete in the <a>Big West Conference</a>, with the exception of the men's and women's water polo teams and the men's volleyball team, which are in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a>. Santa Barbara is best known for its women's <a>basketball</a> and <a>men's soccer</a> teams. In 2006, UCSB won their first NCAA Men's Soccer title and its second overall NCAA championship (1979 water polo) in school history. <a>thumb|left|250px</a> Athletics at UCSB is not limited to the Intercollegiate Athletic Department. While there are some 400 students in ICA, there are over 700 in Club Sports Teams including: Alpine Racing, <a>Cycling</a>, <a>Fencing</a>, <a>Field Hockey</a>, <a>Lacrosse</a>, <a>Roller Hockey</a>, <a>Rugby</a>, <a>Sailing</a>, <a>Soccer</a>, <a>Triathlon</a>, <a>Ultimate Frisbee</a>, <a>Water Ski</a> and <a>Rowing</a>. Many of these teams are highly regarded and compete against Intercollegiate teams from across the US. For example <a>Rowing</a> has produced several national team members including Nine-time National Rowing Team member Amy Fuller, winner of several <a>Olympic</a> and World Championship medals and currently head of the <a>UCLA</a> Rowing Program. The UCSB Cycling Team has also produced several national team members, Olympians, and members of numerous US and international professional teams.</p>
<p>Many other hundreds of students participate in a large Intramural program consisting of Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Flag Football, Golf, Floor Hockey, Indoor and Outdoor Soccer, Racquetball, Squash, Running, Softball, Tennis, Table Tennis, Ultimate Frisbee, Volleyball, Inner tube water polo, and Kickball.</p>
<p>One non-sanctioned sport also draws many student to UCSB: surfing.  The on-campus beaches include a number of decent surfing sites, including &quot;Poles,&quot; &quot;Campus Point,&quot; &quot;Depressions&quot; and &quot;Sands&quot; and &quot;Devereaux Point&quot; on the west campus.  Because Campus Beach actually faces South and East, and is shielded by the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, the surf is usually quite small.  However, a large North or West swell can wrap in to create great waves which are typically very clean and good for surfing.  In the past there has been some informal competition between UCSB surfers and those from other schools; however, it is unknown if this tradition continues.</p>
