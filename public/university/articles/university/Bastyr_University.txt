<p> <strong>Bastyr University</strong> was established as the <strong>John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine</strong> in 1978 in <a>Seattle</a>, <a>Washington</a> (USA) by Sheila Quinn, Joseph Pizzorno, ND, LM; William Mitchell, ND; and Les Griffith, ND, LM. It is named after <a>John Bastyr</a>, a pioneering <a>naturopathic</a> <a>physician</a> and <a>chiropractor</a> in the Seattle area who was instrumental in keeping interest in <a>naturopathic medicine</a> alive through the 1960s. It is one of seven <a>accredited naturopathic medical schools</a> and has offered baccalaureate, masters and doctoral degree programs since 1989.</p>
<p>In 1984, the school was renamed Bastyr College, and in 1994, it became Bastyr University. Bastyr offers degree programs in <a>naturopathic medicine</a>, <a>nutrition</a>, <a>acupuncture</a> and <a>Oriental medicine</a>, <a>exercise science</a> and wellness, <a>health</a> <a>psychology</a>, integrated human biology, <a>midwifery</a>, nutrition and clinical health psychology, and <a>herbal sciences</a>.  And offers certificate programs in Chinese herbal medicine and holistic landscape design (permaculture).</p>
<p>In 1996, Bastyr relocated to its current location in the <strong>Saint Thomas Center</strong>, a former  <a>Catholic</a> <a>seminary</a> building in the <a>Inglewood-Finn Hill</a> neighborhood of <a>Kenmore, Washington</a>.  Its campus is almost completely surrounded by <a>Saint Edward State Park</a>'s dense fir and hemlock forest.  In November, 2005, the university completed the purchase of this property, which it had been leasing from the <a>Archdiocese of Seattle</a>.</p>
<p>Bastyr also operates a natural medicine clinic, <a>Bastyr Center for Natural Health</a>, in <a>Seattle</a>'s <a>Wallingford</a> neighborhood.  The clinic offers naturopathic medicine, acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition counseling, Chinese herbal medicine, and more, and treats many types of health conditions.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>Undergraduate level (degree completion) programs offered are acupuncture and Oriental medicine (a combined BS/MS degree program), nutrition, nutrition and culinary arts, nutrition and exercise science, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, health psychology, and integrated human biology. The bachelor&#x2019;s degree completion programs at Bastyr University require an average of two years' undergraduate prerequisite coursework.</p>
<p>Master's level programs offered are acupuncture and Oriental medicine, midwifery, nutrition, (including a dietetics/dietician track), and nutrition and clinical health psychology (which prepares graduates to pursue licensure both as nutritionists and mental health counselors).</p>
<p>Doctoral level programs are offered in Naturopathic Medicine (ND),  Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM).</p>
<p>Certificate programs are available in Chinese herbal medicine and holistic landscape design.</p>

<p>Monday, Dec. 14, 2009, the <a>Kenmore City Council, 7-0, approved</a>  Bastyr University&#x2019;s <a>Master Plan</a>, following months of review by the city's Planning Commission and City Council.  The plan was bolstered by Bastyr's offer to lease on-campus athletic fields for public use and community scheduling.</p>
<p>Student village:  Bastyr broke ground in May 2009. The new <a>&quot;student village&quot;</a> consists of 11 cottage-style buildings and is designed to minimize impacts to the environment and fit into the campus's natural setting.</p>
<p>Chapel: Bastyr is home to the University's exquisite <a>European-style chapel</a> adding a touch of elegance to the University's special events and conferences. The chapel's long narrow lines, dark oak pews, graceful gold-accented chandeliers and raised altar create an intimate and awe-inspiring environment. With this dignified setting on campus, built in the 1950s when the building was used for a seminary, Bastyr maintains its distinctively spiritual touch. The University also invites choral groups and wedding parties to use the chapel.</p>
<p>The <a>Seattle Times</a> featured an article about this chapel. Don Van Wieringen's first major assignment in the late 1950s, as a new architect, was to help design the acoustics for the St. Thomas Seminary chapel.</p>
<p>Library: The library has the most complete and extensive collection of materials on alternative medicine and natural health in the Pacific Northwest. With 19,000 volumes on a broad range of alternative medicine topics and a great historical collection of rare works books, students can find inspiration and education inside or outside class. In addition, a collection of 250 alternative and complementary medicine journals grants students quick access to recent research findings. Audiotaped and videotaped lectures, CD-ROM textbooks and specialized medical databases help keep students current in their natural health studies.</p>
<p>Bookstore:  At the bookstore, you can find all the required and recommended textbooks along with many popular books on natural health care and related subjects. Students and staff can special order books with a mail order service. In addition, if you want to drink a spritzer, pick out a card for a friend, sniff some aromatherapy oils or buy a homemade cookie, you can find all of that here, too.</p>
<p>Cafeteria: Vegetarian food is available seven days a week. Bastyr University's chef prepares soups, bread, fruit pastries in the morning and pasta salads in the afternoon. A variety of juices and healthy snacks are available, but brownies and organic espresso are another option for those with a hankering for something less &quot;healthy.&quot; During the lunch hour a juice bar is available for shots of wheatgrass or blended smoothies. Sometimes you'll find a bake sale held by nutrition students, but you will always find the cafeteria a place to gather and stay connected to University goings-on.<a>menu</a></p>
<p>Conferences and meetings:  Bastyr's <a>conference services department</a> is dedicated to providing not for profit organizations with fine quality service in conducting meetings, retreats and conferences. <a>Current events and activities.</a></p>
