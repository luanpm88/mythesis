<p> <strong>Morehead State University</strong> is a <a>public</a>, <a>co-educational</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Morehead, Kentucky</a> in the foothills of the <a>Daniel Boone National Forest</a> in <a>Rowan County</a>, midway between <a>Lexington, Kentucky</a>, and <a>Huntington, West Virginia</a>. The 2009 edition of &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> named MSU one of the top 25 public universities in the South. MSU has also become one of only four universities in the U.S. to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in <a>space science</a>. Morehead State University was also the first in Kentucky to offer an online MBA program, accredited by the AACSB. The College of Business &amp; Public Affairs also offers a Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS). With the growing demand for technology savvy and leadership in virtually every industry, this program is designed to prepare leaders who can strategically manage knowledge resources and information technology to improve the productivity, competitiveness, and profitability of any organization in any setting. The school newspaper is The Trail Blazer. The school was founded in 1887 as <strong>Morehead Normal School</strong>, a church-supported teacher-training school.  It was taken over by the state in 1922.  The school's name changed as its mission broadened&#x2014;to Morehead State Normal School and Teachers College in 1926, Morehead State Teachers College in 1930, Morehead State College in 1948 and Morehead State University in 1968.</p>
