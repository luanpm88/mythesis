<p>  </p>
<p>The <strong>State University of New York</strong>, abbreviated <strong>SUNY</strong> () is a system of public institutions of higher education in <a>New York</a>, <a>United States</a>. It is the largest comprehensive system of <a>universities</a>, <a>colleges</a>, and <a>community college</a>s in the world, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students, plus 1.1 million <a>adult education</a> students spanning 64 campuses across the state. The SUNY system has 88,000 faculty members and some 7,660 degree and certificate programs overall and a $10.7 billion budget. SUNY includes many institutions and four University Centers: <a>Albany</a> (1844), <a>Binghamton</a> (1946), <a>Buffalo</a> (1846), and <a>Stony Brook</a> (1957). <a>SUNY's administrative offices</a> are in <a>Albany</a>.</p>
<p>The State University of New York was established in 1948 by then-Governor of New York, <a>Thomas E. Dewey</a>, through legislative implementation of recommendations made by the Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University (1946&#x2013;1948). The Commission was chaired by <a>Owen D. Young</a>, then-Chairman of the <a>General Electric Company</a>. The system was greatly expanded during the administration of Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, who took a personal interest in design and construction of new SUNY facilities across the state.</p>
<p>SUNY comprises all institutions of higher education statewide that are state-supported, with the exception of the institutions that are units of the <a>City University of New York</a> (CUNY).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>New York had a long history of state-supported higher education prior to the creation of  the SUNY system.  On May 7, 1844, the State legislature voted to establish New York State Normal School in Albany. New York created <a>Cornell University</a> as its <a>land grant college</a> in 1865, and it began direct financial support of Cornell's statutory colleges in 1894. From 1889 to 1903, Cornell operated the <a>New York State College of Forestry</a> until the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation, and the school was moved to <a>Syracuse University</a> in 1911 and is now the <a>State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry</a>. In 1908, the State legislature began the NY State College of Agriculture at Alfred University.</p>
<p>In 1946-48 a Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University, chaired by Owen D. Young, then-Chairman of the <a>General Electric Company</a>, studied New York's existing higher education institutions and recommended consolidating them into a state university system. The State University of New York was established in 1948 by then-Governor of New York, Thomas E. Dewey, through legislative implementation of the commission's recommendations. The system was greatly expanded during the administration of Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, who took a personal interest in design and construction of new SUNY facilities across the state.</p>
<p>On October 8, 1953, SUNY took a historic step by banning national fraternities and sororities that discriminated based on race or religion from its 33 campuses. Various fraternities challenged this rule in court.  As a result, national organizations felt pressured to open their membership to students of all races and religions.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>SUNY is governed by a Board of Trustees, which consists of sixteen members, fifteen of whom are appointed by the <a>Governor</a>, with consent of the <a>New York State Senate</a>. The sixteenth member is the President of the <a>SUNY Student Assembly</a>. The Board of Trustees appoints the Chancellor who serves as SUNY Chief Executive Officer.  The  SUNY Chancellor is  Nancy L. Zimpher.</p>
<p>The state of New York assists in financing the SUNY system, which, along with <a>CUNY</a>, provides lower-cost college-level education to residents of the state. SUNY students also come from out-of-state and 171 foreign countries, though tuition is higher for these students. Although tuition is higher for these non-resident students, their tuition is subsidized by New York State taxpayer dollars. </p>
<p>For the 2010-2011 academic year, tuition costs at SUNY schools for an undergrad degree are less than two-thirds the cost of most other state run college institutions in the U.S.  Tuition at the New York State University at Buffalo for an undergrad degree is $7,772.75 per semester or $15,545.50 per year for non-resident students.  Undergrad tuition for non-resident students at the <a>University of Maryland</a> is  $24,830.44 per year.  Non-resident tuition and fees at <a>University of Oregon</a> are $25,830.00 per year. </p>
<p>There are a large variety of colleges in the SUNY system with some overlap in specialties from site to site. SUNY divides its campuses into four distinct categories: university centers/doctoral-granting institutions, university colleges, technology colleges, and community colleges.  SUNY also has a unique relationship with its <a>statutory college</a>s which embeds state-funded colleges within other institutions such as <a>Cornell University</a> and <a>Alfred University</a>.  Students at the statutory  colleges have the benefit of state-subsidized tuition while receiving all of the campus life amenities of the host institutions.</p>
<p>SUNY and the City University of New York are entirely different university systems, despite the fact that both are public institutions which receive funding from New York State. Also, SUNY is not to be confused with the <a>University of the State of New York</a> (USNY), which is the governmental umbrella organization for most education-related institutions and many education-related personnel (both public and private) in New York State, and which includes, as a component, the New York State Education Department.</p>

<h3>Student Representation</h3>
<p>In the 1970s, students pressed for voting representation on the governing board of SUNY colleges.  In 1971, the State Legislature added five student voting members to Cornell's Board of Trustees.  However, at that time, all members of a board must be over the age of 21 for a corporation to hold a liquor license, so to allow Cornell to retain its license, the legislature had to go back to amend NYS Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &#x00a7; 126(4) to require that half the board must be 21.  In 1975, the legislature added a non-voting student seat to the boards of all SUNY units.  Two Attorney General of the State of New York opinion letters reduced the parliamentary rights of the student members to participate at meetings and indicated that they were not in fact Public Officers, and arguably subject to personal liability from lawsuits. In 1977, another statutory amendment made student members of SUNY councils and boards subject to the NYS Public Officers Law or NYS General Municipal Law and granted student representatives parliamentary powers of moving or seconding motions and of placing items on the agendas of the bodies.  Finally, the Legislture gave full voting rights to the student members in 1979, resulting in the students of all SUNY units having voting representatives, except for the NYS <a>College of Environmental Science and Forestry</a>. Finally, in 1986, the legislature gave the student representative of that college voting rights as well.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Every school within the SUNY system manages its own athletics program, which greatly varies the level of competition at each institution.</p>
<h3>Division I</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The four university centers all compete at the <a>Division I</a> level for all of their sports. All but Binghamton field <a>American football</a> teams, with Buffalo in <a>Division I FBS</a> (formerly Division I-A) and Albany and Stony Brook in <a>Division I FCS</a> (formerly Division I-AA).  The four Cornell statutory colleges compete as a part of the <a>Ivy League</a>, an FCS conference that chooses not to participate in <a>the FCS postseason tournament</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>A small number of community colleges compete at the <a>NJCAA Div. 1</a> level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Division II and III</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most SUNY colleges, technical schools and community schools compete at the <a>NCAA</a> or <a>NJCAA</a> Div. II or III level.</li>
  <li>Three SUNY campuses (Environmental Science and Forestry, Canton, and Delhi) are members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p>The most prominent SUNY rivalry is between the Albany Great Danes and Binghamton Bearcats.  The two both belong to the <a>America East</a> athletic conference. Frequently referred to as the <em>I-88 Rivalry</em>, Binghamton and Albany sit at either end of Interstate 88 (roughly 2.5 hours apart). Both teams are known to post the highest visitor attendance at either school's athletic events.</p>
<p>SUNY Oswego and SUNY Plattsburgh also share a notable rivalry in Division 3 Hockey, with that game almost always having the SUNYAC regular season title up for grabs.</p>
<p>SUNY Cobleskill and SUNY Delhi rivalry is mainly involving basketball, cross country, and previously track, although Cobleskill track and field competes at the NCAA Division III level starting spring 2009.  They are in fairly close proximity to each other.  The SUNY Delhi 2003-2004 basketball season was canceled after a basketball game was called with 48 seconds left after several SUNY Delhi basketball players nearly started a brawl in the Ioro Gymnasium at SUNY Cobleskill on Wednesday February 4, 2004.</p>
<p>SUNY Oneonta has developed a rivalry in almost every sport with SUNY Cortland. They both share the red dragon mascot and when the teams come to play the games are known as &quot;The battle of the red dragons&quot;</p>
<p>There is an unusual sports rivalry between SUNY-ESF and Finger Lakes Community College, with both campuses sponsoring nationally-ranked teams in <a>timber sports</a> (woodsmen's teams).</p>
<h3>Cultural Rivalries</h3>
<p>SUNY Potsdam and SUNY Canton participate in a Go Hard Go Home challenge which is a cultural event where each school's various cultural clubs and amateur talent  participate in a face-off. Go Hard Go Home started in the semester of Spring 2009. The Go Hard, Go Home Challenge consists of a DJ Battle, Step Team Battle, Dance Team Battle, and a Rapping Battle.</p>
