<p> The <strong>United States Air Force Academy</strong> (<em>USAFA</em> or <em>Air Force</em>) is an accredited college for the undergraduate education of officer candidates for the <a>United States Air Force</a>. Its campus is located immediately north of <a>Colorado Springs</a> in <a>El Paso County</a>, <a>Colorado</a>, United States. The Academy's stated mission is &quot;to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.&quot; It is the youngest of the five United States <a>service academies</a>, having graduated its first class in 1959. Graduates of the Academy's four-year program receive a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree, and most are commissioned as <a>second lieutenant</a>s in the <a>United States Air Force</a>. The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in <a>Colorado</a>, attracting more than a million visitors each year. However, a few do; <a>Forbes Magazine</a> recently ranked the Academy the #2 public college in the United States and the #7 college overall in its &quot;America's Best Colleges 2009&quot; publication. Candidates for admission are judged on their academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, athletics and character. To gain admission, candidates must also pass a fitness test, undergo a thorough medical examination, and secure a nomination, which usually comes from the member of <a>Congress</a> in the candidate's home district. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,400 cadets; historically just under 1,000 of those will graduate.</p>
<p>The program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of &quot;<em>Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do</em>,&quot; Other officials expressed similar sentiments. In 1919, Congressman <a>Charles F. Curry</a> introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about cost, curriculum and location led to its demise. Mitchell's arguments did not gain traction with legislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the United States Air Force Academy began to take shape. As a result, the first classes of cadets wore temporary uniforms while the official uniform was developed. Secretary Talbott then sought out legendary <a>Hollywood</a> director <a>Cecil B. DeMille</a> for help. DeMille's designs&#x2014;most notably his design of the cadet parade uniform&#x2014;won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets today.</p>
<p>The Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. Most notably, the first class adopted the <a>Cadet Honor Code</a>, and chose the <a>falcon</a> as the <a>Academy's mascot</a>. In 1957, the Air Force cadets marched in the <a>Inaugural Parade</a> of President <a>Dwight Eisenhower</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>. On 29 August 1958, the <a>wing</a> of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs, and less than a year later the Academy received <a>accreditation</a>. The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on 3 June 1959.</p>
<h3>Vietnam</h3>
<p>The <a>Vietnam War</a> was the first war in which Academy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the development of the character of the Academy. Due to the need for more pilots, Academy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the graduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970. Academy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better meet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The <a>Jacks Valley</a> field training area was added, the <a>Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape</a> (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft training started in 1968. One hundred forty-one graduates died in the conflict; thirty-two graduates became <a>prisoners of war</a>. <a>Lance Sijan</a>, '65, fell into both categories and became the first Academy graduate to be awarded the <a>Medal of Honor</a> due to his heroism while evading capture and in captivity. Sijan Hall, one of the cadet dormitories, is named in his memory.</p>
<p>The effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the Academy as well. Because the Academy grounds are generally open to the public, the Academy often became a site for protests by anti-war demonstrators. Some male cadets also believed that the presence of women had softened the rigors of Academy life and that women received special treatment. According to at least one commentator, as many as ten percent of male Academy graduates in the late 1970s and early 1980s requested Army commissions, in part because of controversy over such issues. The Class of 1979, the last all-male class, went so far as to unofficially label themselves &quot;LCWB,&quot; or &quot;Last Class With Balls&quot; (sometimes also interpreted as &quot;Last Class Without Bitches&quot;) an abbreviation that appeared on many of their class-specific items and still appears at reunions, sporting events and other Academy alumni functions.</p>
<h2>Campus and facilities</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|260px|&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Interior of Cadet Chapel&lt;/div&gt;</a></p>
<p>The campus of the Academy covers 18,000 acres (73&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) on the east side of the Rampart Range of the <a>Rocky Mountains</a>, just north of <a>Colorado Springs</a>. Its altitude is normally given as 7,258 feet (2,212 m) above sea-level, which is the elevation of the cadet area. The Academy was designed by <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a> (SOM) and lead architect <a>Walter Netsch</a>.  SOM partner <a>John O. Merrill</a> moved from Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction. Merrill was a project spokesman for the project.</p>
<p>The most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its chapel. At one point, he was prepared to abandon the design; but the accordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy campus.</p>
<h3>The Cadet Area</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of <a>aluminum</a> on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft.  On 1 April 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy was designated a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>.</p>
<p>The main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as &#x2018;&#x2018;the Terrazzo&#x2019;&#x2018;. Most recognizable is the 17-spired <a><em>Cadet Chapel&#x2019;&#x2018;</em></a>. The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most beautiful examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include &#x2018;&#x2018;Vandenberg Hall&#x2019;&#x2018; and &#x2018;&#x2018;Sijan Hall&#x2019;&#x2018;, the two dormitories; &#x2018;&#x2018;Mitchell Hall&#x2019;&#x2018;, the cadet dining facility; and &#x2018;&#x2018;Fairchild Hall&#x2019;&#x2018; the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the <a>Robert F. McDermott</a> Library.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Air Force Academy Falcon Stadium</a>The &#x2018;&#x2018;Aeronautics Research Center&#x2019;&#x2018; (also known as the &quot;Aero Lab&quot;) contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed, and cascade <a>wind tunnel</a>s; engine and rocket test cells; and simulators. The &#x2018;&#x2018;Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF)&#x2019;&#x2018; was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory and a planetarium for academic use and navigation training.</p>
<p>The cadet social center is &#x2018;&#x2018;Arnold Hall&#x2019;&#x2018; which houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom and a number of lounge, dining and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. &#x2018;&#x2018;Harmon Hall&#x2019;&#x2018; is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the <a>Superintendent</a> and the Superintendent's staff.</p>
<p>The Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields are the &#x2018;&#x2018;Cadet Gymnasium&#x2019;&#x2018; and the &#x2018;&#x2018;Cadet Fieldhouse&#x2019;&#x2018;. The Fieldhouse is the home to <a>Clune Arena</a>, the <a>ice hockey rink</a> and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for a number of sports. &#x2018;&#x2018;<a>Falcon Stadium</a>&#x2019;&#x2018;, located outside of the Cadet Area, is the <a>football</a> field and site of the graduation ceremonies.  The Code itself is simple:</p>
<p>:: <em>We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. </em> Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as &quot;4 degrees,&quot; &quot;3 degrees&quot; or &quot;2 degrees&quot; based on their class. First-class cadets (seniors) are referred to as &quot;firsties.&quot; In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets hold the positions of cadet officers, second class cadets act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets represent the cadet junior non-commissioned officers.</p>
<p>The Cadet Wing is divided into four <a>groups</a>, of ten cadet <a>squadron</a>s each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadrons. Military training and intramural athletics are conducted by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an <a>Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force <a>major</a>. For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty <a>lieutenant colonel</a>. These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers.</p>
<h3>Base organization</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <a>Superintendent</a> of the Academy is the commander and senior officer. The position of Superintendent is normally held by an active-duty <a>lieutenant general</a>. The superintendent's role is roughly similar to that of the president of a civilian university. As such, the Superintendent oversees all aspects of the Academy, including military training, academics, athletics, admissions and the administration of the base. The Academy is a <a>Direct Reporting Unit</a> within the Air Force, so the Superintendent reports directly to the <a>Air Force Chief of Staff</a>.</p>
<p>Those reporting to the Superintendent include the Dean of the Faculty and Commandant of Cadets, each of whom typically holds the rank of <a>brigadier general</a>, as well as the Director of Athletics, the Commander of the <a>10th Air Base Wing</a> and the Commander of the <a>Prep School</a>, each of whom typically holds the rank of <a>colonel</a>. The 10th Air Base Wing provides all base support functions that exist at other air force bases, including civil engineering, communications, medical support, personnel, administration, security and base services. The Preparatory School provides an academic, athletic and military program for qualified young men and women who may need certain additional preparation prior to acceptance to the Academy. All flying programs at the Academy are run by the <a>306th Flying Training Group</a>, which reports to the <a>Air Education and Training Command</a>, ensuring uniformity of flight training with the rest of the Air Force.</p>
<h3>Board of Visitors</h3>
<p>Congressional oversight of the Academy is exercised through a Board of Visitors, established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9355. The Board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods and other matters relating to the Academy. The Board meets at least four times per year and prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to the <a>Secretary of Defense</a>, the <a>Senate Armed Services Committee</a>, and the <a>House Armed Services Committee</a>. The 15 members of the board are variously appointed by the <a>President of the United States</a>, the <a>Vice President</a>, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees and the <a>Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>. Since 2006, the Board has been required to include at least two Academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BOV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academy&#x2019;s advisory board.</p>
<h2>Military training</h2>
<p>:<em>See also: <a>Sandhurst Competition</a> (a military skills event)</em> <a>thumb|DA40 of USAFA at RIAT 2010.</a> &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|300px|Basic cadets complete the obstacle course during BCT</a> --&gt; Cadets' military training occurs throughout their time at the Academy, but is especially intense during their four summers. The first military experience for new cadets (called &quot;basic cadets&quot;) occurs during the six weeks of <a>Basic Cadet Training</a> (BCT), in the summer before their fourth class (freshman) year. During BCT, also known as &quot;beast,&quot; cadets learn the fundamentals of military and Academy life under the leadership of a cadre of first and second class cadets.  Basic cadets learn military customs and courtesies, proper wear of the uniform, drill and ceremony, and study military knowledge and undergo a rigorous physical training program. During the second half of BCT, basic cadets march to <a>Jacks Valley</a>, where they complete the program in a field encampment environment. Upon completion of BCT, basic cadets receive their fourth-class <a>shoulder boards</a>, take the Honor Oath and are formally accepted as members of the Cadet Wing.</p>
<p>The fourth-class (freshman) year is traditionally the most difficult at the Academy, militarily. In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy demands are placed on fourth class cadets outside of class. Fourth class cadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-related knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement and actions&#x2014;traversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including staying on the marble &quot;strips&quot; on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper class cadets using a very specific decorum. The fourth class year ends with &quot;Recognition,&quot; a physically and mentally demanding several-day event which culminates in the award of the <a>Prop and Wings</a> insignia to the fourth class cadets, signifying their ascension to the ranks of upper class cadets. After Recognition, the stringent rules of the fourth class year are relaxed.</p>
<p>After the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training. Between their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in Air Force operations in a deployed environment (called &quot;Global Engagement&quot;) and may participate in flying <a>gliders</a> or free-fall <a>parachute training</a>. From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, cadets also completed <a>SERE</a> training in the <a>Jacks Valley</a> complex between their fourth- and third-class years.  This program was replaced with Combat Survival Training (CST) in 1995 and done away with entirely in 2005. In the summer of 2008, the CST program was reintroduced and now includes survival, evasion, and resistance training portions. During their last two summers, cadets may serve as BCT cadre, travel to active duty Air Force bases and participate in a variety of other research, aviation and leadership programs. They may also be able to take courses offered by other military services, such as the U.S. Army's <a>Airborne School</a> at <a>Fort Benning</a>, Georgia, or the <a>Air Assault School</a>, at <a>Fort Campbell</a>, Kentucky. During the academic year, all cadets take formal classes in military theory, operations and leadership.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Eagle and Fledglings Statue at the south end of the Air Gardens is inscribed with the quote, &quot;Man's flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge&quot;</a> The Air Force Academy is an accredited four-year university offering <a>Bachelor's degree</a>s in a variety of subjects. Approximately 75 percent of the faculty are Air Force officers, with the remaining 25 percent civilian professors, visiting professors from civilian universities and instructors from other U.S. and allied foreign military services. In recent years, civilians have become a growing portion of senior faculty. All graduates receive a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree, regardless of major, because of the technical content of the core requirements. The <a>Dean</a> of the Faculty is usually an active-duty <a>brigadier general</a>, although a civilian may hold the position. Each academic department is chaired by a &quot;<a>permanent professor</a>&quot;, an academic rank and position somewhat analogous to a tenured senior professor at a civilian university.</p>
<p>Cadets may major in a variety of divisional, disciplinary or inter-disciplinary subjects, including majors in engineering, the basic sciences, social sciences and humanities. The academic program has an extensive <a>core curriculum</a>, in which all cadets take required courses in the <a>sciences</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, <a>humanities</a>, <a>military studies</a> and <a>physical education</a>. Approximately sixty percent of a cadet's courseload is mandated by the core curriculum. As a result, most of a cadet's first two years are spent in core classes. During the third and fourth years, cadets have more flexibility to focus in their major areas of study, but the core requirements are still significant.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the academic program at the Air Force Academy (as with military academies in general) has focused heavily on science and engineering, with the idea that many graduates would be expected to manage complex aeronautical, astronautical and communications systems. As a result, the Academy's engineering programs have traditionally been ranked highly. The primary elements of the athletic program are intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, <a>physical education</a>, and the physical fitness tests.</p>
<h3>Physical education</h3>
<p>Cadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the Academy. The classes cover a wide range of activities: <a>Swimming</a> and water survival build confidence while teaching important survival skills. Combative sports such as <a>boxing</a>, <a>wrestling</a>, <a>judo</a> and unarmed combat build confidence, teach controlled aggression and develop physical fitness. Cadets also take classes in team sports such as <a>basketball</a> and <a>soccer</a>, in lifetime sports such as <a>tennis</a> and <a>golf</a> and on the physiology of exercise.</p>
<h3>Fitness tests</h3>
<p>Each semester, cadets must pass two athletic fitness tests.  The first is the <a>Aerobic Fitness</a> Test, or AFT, a timed 1.5 mile (2.4&nbsp;km) run. The second is the demanding Physical Fitness Test, or &quot;PFT,&quot; which consists of five events&#x2014;<a>pull-ups</a>, a <a>standing long jump</a>, <a>sit-up</a>s, <a>push-ups</a> and a <a>600 yard sprint</a>&#x2014;all done in a 15-minute time frame. Failure to pass a fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned to reconditioning until he can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment.</p>
<h3>Intramural athletics</h3>
<p>All cadets are expected to compete in <a>intramural</a> athletics for their entire time at the Academy, unless they are on-season for intercollegiate athletics. Intramural sports pit cadet squadrons against one another in many sports, including <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross-country</a>, <a>flag football</a>, <a>racquetball</a>, <a>flickerball</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>boxing</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>mountain biking</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>team handball</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>Ultimate</a>, <a>wallyball</a> and <a>volleyball</a>. Winning the Wing Championship in a given sport is a particular source of pride for a cadet squadron.</p>
<h3>Intercollegiate athletics</h3>
<p> The Academy's intercollegiate program has 17 men's and 10 women's NCAA sanctioned teams, nicknamed the &#x2018;&#x2018;Falcons.&#x2019;&#x2018; The <a>Academy's men's and women's rugby teams</a> have each won multiple national championships and the women's side recently had two players selected for the United States national team. The <a>football team</a> has played in 17 <a>bowl game</a>s and the <a>basketball team</a> has had strong showings in the last several years, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and, most recently, making the final four of the <a>2007 NIT Tournament</a>. The <a>men's ice hockey team</a> won the last two Atlantic Hockey conference tournaments, made the first ever appearance by a service academy in the NCAA hockey tournament in 2007, and made a repeat appearance in 2008. The Air Force Academy's Mens Hockey team recently lost in the 'Elite Eight' of hockey in double overtime. This marked the farthest they had gone in the post-season in school history and the longest an Atlantic Hockey Association team has made it into the post-season.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p>Admission to the Academy is particularly selective. To be eligible to enter the Academy, a candidate must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be a <a>citizen of the United States</a> (unless nominated by an official of a country invited by the <a>Department of Defense</a>)</li>
  <li>Be unmarried with no dependents</li>
  <li>Be of good <a>moral character</a></li>
  <li>Be at least 17, but less than 23 years of age by 1 July of the year of entry</li>
  <li>Meet high leadership, academic, physical and medical standards</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the normal application process, all candidates must secure a nomination to the Academy, normally from a <a>U.S. Senator</a> or <a>U.S. Representative</a>. Each member of <a>Congress</a> and the <a>Vice President</a> can have five appointees attending the Air Force Academy at any time. The process for obtaining a congressional nomination is not political and candidates do not have to know their senator or representative to secure a nomination. Additional nomination slots are available for children of career military personnel, children of disabled <a>veteran</a>s or veterans who were <a>killed in action</a>, or children of <a>Medal of Honor</a> recipients. The admissions process is a lengthy one and applicants usually begin the paperwork during the second semester of their junior year of <a>high school</a>.</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p>Despite the high standards expected of cadets, faculty and staff, and the high admission standards, the Academy has not been immune from scandal.</p>
<h3>Honor scandals</h3>
<p>The first Honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing of more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. One hundred and nine cadets were ultimately expelled. Cheating scandals plagued the Academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004 and 2007. Following each of these events, the Academy thoroughly examined the etiology of the mass cheating in addition to alleged excessive pressures that the academic system at the time placed on cadets and made changes in attempts to reduce the opportunities for future incidents.</p>
<h3>Allegations of sexual harassment, assault and gender bias</h3>
<p> The sexual assault scandal that broke in 2003 forced the Academy to look more closely at how effectively women had been integrated into cadet life. Following the scandal and rising concerns about sexual assault throughout the U.S. military, the Department of Defense established a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at each of the United States service academies. The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported <a>sexual assault</a>. At the same time, the Academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and gender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault reporting. The Academy's decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by officials and experts.</p>
<h3>Religious atmosphere</h3>
<p>In 2005, allegations surfaced that some <a>Evangelical Christian</a> cadets and staff were effectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the Academy.  These allegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other religious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a lawsuit against the Air Force.  An Air Force panel investigated the accusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005. The panel's investigation found a &quot;religious climate that does not involve overt religious discrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members&#x2019; needs and a lack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and impermissible expression of beliefs.&quot;  Evidence discovered during the investigation included <a>antisemitic</a> remarks, official sponsorship of a showing of  the film <em><a>The Passion of the Christ</a></em> and a locker room banner that said academy athletes played for &quot;Team Jesus.&quot; In response to the panel's findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to discourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate worship by non-Christian religions.</p>
<p>In 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following <a>Wicca</a>, <a>Neo-druidism</a>, or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths.</p>
<p>A 2010 survey found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified themselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious proselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school.  The survey's results, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join in religious activities had declined from previous years.  Colorado congressman <a>Mike Coffman</a> criticized the academy for resisting calls to release details of the survey's results.</p>
