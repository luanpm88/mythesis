<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|main campus (dark brown building area) aerial view in Munich downtown</a> The TUM, like many German universities, is a &#x201c;no campus&#x201d; university. However, with further expansion plans for the Garching site, more and more departments are to be placed into new buildings in Garching. The Garching campus, unlike the downtown area, is set up more like a traditional &#x201c;quadrangle&#x201d; style campus with a large grouping of buildings. At the moment, university buildings are spread over four main and several minor locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main campus in downtown <a>Munich</a></li>
  <li><a>Garching</a> (Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, neutron source); on the same campus, there are also several other research institutes</li>
  <li><a>Weihenstephan</a> (Center for Life and Food Science)</li>
  <li>Hospital &#x201c;<a>Klinikum Rechts der Isar</a>&#x201d; (Medicine), <a>Munich</a> <img></li>
</ul>
