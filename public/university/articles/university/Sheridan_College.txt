<p> <strong>Sheridan College </strong> is a diploma and degree granting Canadian postsecondary educational institution with campuses in the western suburbs of Toronto, Ontario:  Oakville, Brampton and as of September 2011, also Mississauga. Sheridan was founded in 1967 and is particularly well known for excellence in arts programs, such as animation, illustration, music theatre performance, and crafts and design.</p>
<p>Over 100 academic programs also include business, broadcast, print and new media journalism, information technologies, applied computing and engineering sciences, public safety and early childhood education. Additionally it teaches a broad array of continuing education courses for adult learners.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left</a> Sheridan College was established in 1967 as a community college through the leadership of Bill Davis who at the time was the Ontario Government&#x2019;s Minister of Education and Minister of University Affairs. It was originally located in a converted high school in Brampton before a purpose built campus was opened on Trafalgar Road in Oakville, Ontario. </p>
<p>[[<a>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Davis</a>|Bill Davis]]</p>
<p>From its start the institution has been known for its progressive use of technology in its programs; for instance, it was one of the earliest users of computers in its animation course and one of the earliest colleges to incorporate the use of laptops into teaching methodology. Its role as an institution teaching advanced applied courses and the significance of technology was recognized in 2002 when it was renamed Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning (under the <a>Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act</a>).  </p>
<p>Located in suburban cities just west of Toronto, the institution has full campuses in Oakville (in the region of Halton), and in Brampton (in region of Peel).  These regions have been two of the fastest growing regions in Canada helping drive the institution&#x2019;s growth. In May 2009 funding was announced for a new campus in downtown Mississauga that will focus on business and is scheduled to open in September 2011.</p>
<h2>Sheridan College Profile</h2>
<p>Sheridan serves over 16,000 full-time students and 35,000 continuing education students annually. Its mission, as described in its 2009&#x2013;2014 strategic plan, is &#x201c;to provide students of all ages with the knowledge and skills to thrive in a rapidly changing world.&#x201d; Its vision is to be &#x201c;world-class providers of innovative and creative learning.&#x201d; As a result of the changing nature of society and work, requiring more flexible skills, creativity and adaptability, the college is instituting new approaches to curriculum development and delivery.  These are described in a working paper titled, <em>Shine Brighter: Academic Innovation Strategy (AIS),</em> published in July 2010. </p>
<p>The mandate of the college is to deliver learning that is immediately useful in the workplace helping students successfully launch into their future careers. College performance is monitored through annual surveys that measure student, graduate and employer satisfaction, graduation rate and employment rate. The resulting key performance indicators (KPIs) can be compared with similar institutions. KPI tracking is an initiative of the Ontario Provincial Government and the results are published regularly. </p>
<p>The college is a member of <a>Polytechnics Canada</a>, a national alliance of Canada's nine leading research-intensive, colleges and institutes of technology, located in Canada&#x2019;s key economic regions. All are degree-granting and industry-responsive postsecondary education institutions committed to ensuring that graduates find employment as highly qualified workers in the industry sector of their choice.</p>
<p>Sheridan has been recognized with many prestigious awards over the years including 11 Premier&#x2019;s Awards, more than any other Ontario college. The faculty, staff and students have received more <a>Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC)</a> national awards of excellence, more than any other college in Canada. In 2010, in a field of only five categories, Sheridan was awarded three Gold and one Silver ACCC award. Each year, Sheridan students, faculty and alumni distinguish themselves through a diverse array of awards programs. </p>
<p>Sheridan graduates include <a>Academy Award</a> nominees (3) and winners (2), and in 2005, animation professor <a>Kaj Pindal</a> won an <a>Emmy Award</a>. </p>
<p>A new marketing campaign with the tagline &#x201c;<a>Shine Brighter</a>&#x201d; was launched in September 2009. The strategy behind the campaign is to convey Sheridan&#x2019;s strength in applied innovation and creativity and encourage the students themselves to showcase their talents and develop a positive <a>digital footprint</a>.</p>

<h2>Students Making News</h2>
<h3><a>Travis Magazine</a></h3>
<p>Travis magazine is a free magazine produced six times/year by Sheridan College's Student Union. The magazine showcases art, writing and design by Sheridan students.

The publication has grown to include an annual photography issue, online viewable version and blog.</p>
<p>The magazine was founded by a group of journalism students in 2005. The group printed two issues in black and white before the Student Union started funding the publication in full colour.</p>
