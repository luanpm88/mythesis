<p> The <strong>University of South Alabama</strong> (<strong>USA</strong>) is a <a>public</a>, doctoral-level <a>university</a> in <a>Mobile</a>, <a>Alabama</a>, <a>USA</a>. It was created by the <a>Alabama Legislature</a> in 1963, and replaced existing extension programs operated in Mobile by the <a>University of Alabama</a>. The rich cultural diversity of the Mobile area made it the obvious choice.  No other areas of the state were willing to support such a school at that time.  Plans for this university were being made as early as 1956.</p>
<p>The University is divided into nine colleges and schools, and includes Alabama's second state-supported <a>medical school</a>. The university has an enrollment of over 15,000 students.  To date, the University has awarded over 62,325 degrees.</p>
<p>The University has an annual payroll of $245 million (US), with over 5,500 employees, and is the largest employer in Mobile, Alabama.  It has remained one of Alabama's fastest growing universities for the past several years.</p>
<h2>Academics and campus life</h2>
<p>The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees in nine colleges and schools. Several programs offer masters level degrees in addition to undergraduate degrees. Doctoral level degrees are offered in several areas, including <a>Nursing</a>, <a>Medicine</a>, Basic Medical Sciences, Instructional Design, Communication Sciences and Disorders, <a>Audiology</a>, <a>Marine Science</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree offered in collaboration with <a>Auburn University</a>. The psychology doctoral program was initiated in 2009 and is one of a handful of such programs nationwide that offers a Combined degree, emphasizing both Clinical Psychology and Counseling Psychology. Significant research is done by faculty members in the above fields.</p>
