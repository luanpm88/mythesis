<p>  The <strong>University of Freiburg</strong> (<a>German</a> <strong><em>Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&#x00e4;t Freiburg</em></strong>, colloquially <strong><em>Uni Freiburg</em></strong> or just <strong><em>Freiburg</em></strong>), sometimes referred to in English as the <strong>Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg</strong>, is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Freiburg im Breisgau</a>, <a>Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>, <a>Germany</a>. </p>
<p>The university was founded in 1457 by the <a>Habsburg</a> dynasty as the second university in <a>Austrian</a>-Habsburg territory after the <a>University of Vienna</a>. Today, Freiburg is the <a>fifth-oldest university in Germany</a>, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. The university is made up of 11 <a>faculties</a> and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over one hundred and twenty other countries. Foreign students constitute about 16% of total student numbers.</p>
<p>The University of Freiburg is one of Europe's most prestigious universities and is amongst its top research and teaching institutions. With its long-standing reputation of excellence, the university looks both to the past, to maintain its historic academic and cultural heritage, and to the future, developing new methods and opportunities to meet the needs of a changing world. The University of Freiburg has been home to some of the greatest minds of the <a>Western tradition</a>, including such eminent figures as <a>Johann Eck</a>, <a>Max Weber</a>, <a>Rudolf Carnap</a>, <a>Edmund Husserl</a>, <a>Friedrich Meinecke</a>, <a>Martin Heidegger</a>, <a>Hannah Arendt</a>, <a>Hans-Georg Gadamer</a> and <a>Friedrich Hayek</a>. In addition, 19 <a>Nobel laureates</a> are affiliated with the University of Freiburg and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the <a>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize</a>, while working at the University of Freiburg.</p>
<p>As of 2007, the university has been designated an elite German &quot;<a>University of Excellence</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Universitaetsgruender Erzherzog Albrecht VI.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Portrait of Archduke [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert VI of Austria]], founder of the University.]] Originally <em>Albrechts University</em>, the university started with four faculties (<a>theology</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, <a>medicine</a> and <a>law</a>).  Its establishment belongs to the second wave of German university foundings in the late <a>Middle Ages</a>, like the <a>Eberhard Karls University of T&#x00fc;bingen</a> and the <a>University of Basel</a>. Established by papal privilege (<a>papal bull</a>) the University in Freiburg actually was - like all or most universities in the Middle Ages - a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the <a>Roman Catholic Church</a> and its hierarchy. The bishop of <a>Basel</a> consequently was its <a>provost</a> or <a>chancellor</a> (<em>Kanzler</em>), the bishop of <a>Constance</a> was its patron while the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke <a>Albert VI of Austria</a>, being the brother of <a>Frederick III</a>, Emperor of the <a>Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation</a>. At its founding, the university was named after <a>Albert VI of Austria</a>. He provided the university with land and  <a>endowments</a> as well as its own <a>jurisdiction</a>. Also he declared Albrechts University as the &quot;county university&quot; (German <em>Landesuniversit&#x00e4;t</em>) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian <a>House of Habsburg</a> in 1490.  <a>thumb|260px|Freiburg around 1900</a></p>
<p>The University soon attracted many students as the <a>humanists</a> <a>Geiler von Kaysersberg</a>, <a>Johann Reuchlin</a> or <a>Jakob Wimpfeling</a>. When <a>Ulrich Zasius</a> was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of <a>humanist</a> jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535 <a>Erasmus of Rotterdam</a> lived and taught in <a>Freiburg</a>. From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the <em>Altes Collegium</em> (&quot;Old College&quot;), today called the &quot;new town-hall&quot;. The importance of the university decreased during the time of the <a>Counter-Reformation</a>. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the <a>Jesuits</a> in 1620. From 1682 on, the <a>Jesuits</a> built their college as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the &quot;University Church&quot; or <em>Universit&#x00e4;tskirche</em>). </p>
<p>The university had to move out of Freiburg several times, as from 1686 to 1698, when French troops occupied Freiburg and the southern parts of the <a>upper Rhine</a> region.</p>
<p><a>thumb|260px|<em>Kollegiengeb&#x00e4;ude I</em>, erected in 1913 as main building of the university.|left</a></p>
<p>After <a>Freiburg</a> was re-conquered and appointed as capital of <a>Further Austria</a>, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress <a>Maria Theresa of Austria</a>. The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only <a>Roman Catholic</a>s were allowed to study) and <a>Natural Sciences</a> were added as well as <a>Public Administration</a>. Also in 1767, the university became a governmental institution despite the Church's protests. The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the <a>Jesuits</a> were suppressed following a decree signed by <a>Pope Clement XIII</a> in 1773. Consequently, <a>Johann Georg Jacobi</a> (brother of the more famous philosopher <a>Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</a>) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in <a>Freiburg</a>.</p>
<p>When <a>Freiburg</a> became a part of the newly established <a>Grand Duchy</a> of <a>Baden</a> (in German &quot;<em>Gro&#x00df;herzogtum Baden</em>&quot;) in 1805 (after <a>Napoleon</a> occupied the area of the formerly <a>Further Austria</a>), a crisis began for the university in <a>Freiburg</a>. Indeed there were considerations by <a>Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden</a> and <a>Karl, Grand Duke of Baden</a> to close down the university in <a>Freiburg</a> while both of them thought that the <a>Grand Duchy</a> could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the <a>Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg</a> also already existed since 1386). The university had enough <a>endowments</a> and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of <a>Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden</a> in 1818. Finally in 1820 he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg (<em>Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&#x00e4;t Freiburg</em>) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of <a>Freiburg</a>. </p>
<p>[[File:DBP 256 Uni Freiburg 10 Pf 1957.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Postage stamp]] by <a>Deutsche Bundespost</a> to commemorate the university's 500th anniversary 1957]]</p>
<p>In the 1880s the population of the <a>student</a> body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers like economist <a>Adolph Wagner</a>, historians <a>Georg von Below</a> and <a>Friedrich Meinecke</a>, or jurists <a>Karl von Amira</a> and <a>Paul Lenel</a>. </p>
<p>The University of Freiburg, among others, served as a role model for the establishment of <a>Johns Hopkins University</a> in <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>USA</a>, in 1875. Johns Hopkins was the first US university committed to research following <a>Alexander von Humboldt</a>'s ideas of research as practiced at German universities at the time. <a>Daniel Coit Gilman</a>, founding president of Johns Hopkins, who had studied in Germany, visited Freiburg and other German universities in preparation for the founding of Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>In 1900 Freiburg became the first German university to accept a female student. Just before <a>World War I</a> the university counted 3,000 students. After World War I the <a>philosophers</a> <a>Edmund Husserl</a> and (since 1928) <a>Martin Heidegger</a> taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as <a>Edith Stein</a>. On the field of social sciences, <a>Walter Eucken</a> developed the idea of <a>ordoliberalism</a>, which consequently is also known as the &quot;<a>Freiburg School</a>&quot;. </p>
<p>In the beginning of the 20th century several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as in 1911 the new main building. During the &quot;<a>Third Reich</a>&quot; the university went through the process of &quot;political alignment&quot; (<a>Gleichschaltung</a>) like the rest of the German universities. Under the rector <a>Martin Heidegger</a> all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the &quot;&#x2018;Law for the Reintroduction of Professional Civil Service&quot;.  After <a>World War II</a> the university was re-opened. New buildings for natural <a>sciences</a> were erected in the <em>Institutsviertel</em> (&quot;institute quarter&quot;). </p>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|The University of Freiburg in 1961</a></p>
<p>In the postwar years, the ideas of <a>ordoliberalism</a>, developed earlier by economists of the <a>Freiburg School</a> such as <a>Walter Eucken</a>, <a>Franz B&#x00f6;hm</a>, Hans Grossmann-Doerth and Leonhard Miksch drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant <a>Wirtschaftswunder</a>. <a>Nobel Prize</a> winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, <a>Friedrich Hayek</a> is also associated with this theory. He directed the <a>Walter Eucken Institut</a>, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for socio-cultural research at the university. </p>
<p>In the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of <a>Applied Sciences</a> becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to eleven. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.</p>
<p>In 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the <a>League of European Research Universities (LERU)</a>. One year later, in 2007, the University of Freiburg was chosen as one of nine German <em>Universities of Excellence</em>.</p>
<p><a>|thumb|200px|The university seal is set into the floor at the entrance of the largest lecture hall <em>auditorium maximum</em></a></p>
<h3>University seal</h3>
<p>The seal of the University of Freiburg depicts the educator <a>Christ</a> seated on a gothic throne holding the gospel in his right hand  with the temple curtain in the background. Christ offers the teachings of the gospel to the Jewish scholars who are crouched at his feet. To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of <a>Jerusalem</a>. Located to the right of Christ is the <a>coat of arms</a> of the Austrian duchies, a banner with five eagles. The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories. The coat of arms of the city of Freiburg is located at the bottom of the seal, displaying <a>St George's Cross</a>. The Latin inscription on the seal reads <em>Sigillum universitatis studii friburgensis brisgaudie</em>. The seal was slightly modified in 1913, but has otherwise been in continuous use since it was adopted in 1462.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uni Freiburg - Philosoph.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Aristotle]], in front of the <em>Kollegiengeb&#x00e4;ude I</em>|left]] Having grown with the city since the 15th century, the university's buildings are deeply intertwined with the city. There are three large campuses  (the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter and the applied sciences campus), but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg.</p>
<p>The university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the <a>Jugendstil</a> <em>Kollegiengeb&#x00e4;ude I</em>, built in 1911 by Hermann Billing, and the <a>gothic revival</a> old university library. The current <a>University Library</a> is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and is to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September, 2008. It is one of the largest in Germany and placed 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in an October, 2007 German national ranking of university libraries.</p>
<p>The <a>University Church</a>, located across from <em>Kollegiengeb&#x00e4;ude II</em>, was built in 1683 by the <a>Jesuit order</a>. The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the <a>Jesuit order was suppressed</a> in 1773. The church was destroyed in the November 27, 1944 bombing raid on Freiburg, and reconstructed in 1956. </p>
<p>The &#x201c;institute quarter&#x201d; (<em>Institutsviertel</em>) is home to the science faculties. This campus was destroyed almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After <a>World War II</a>, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, as well as the renowned pre-clinical institutes of the <a>Faculty of Medicine</a>.  <a>thumb|300px|The <em>Department of Surgery</em> at the University Medical Center.</a> The applied sciences campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center. The campus is home to the <a>IMTEK</a> (Institut f&#x00fc;r Mikrosystemtechnik, Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science. With the addition of the Faculty for Applied Sciences, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies.</p>
<p>The <a>University Medical Center Freiburg</a> (<em>Universit&#x00e4;tsklinikum Freiburg</em>) is one of Germany's largest medical centers. It boasts  1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated ambulatorily. It consists of 13 specialized clinics, 5 clinical institutes, and 5 centers (e.g. Center for Transplantation Medicine). The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart <em>Jarvik 2000</em> (2002).</p>
<p>Most recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics as well as history departments of the <a>Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies</a> (FRIAS).</p>
<h2>Students and Admission</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uni Freiburg - KGIV.jpg|thumb|220px|<em>Kollegiengeb&#x00e4;ude IV</em>, Humanities Faculty (Former [[University Library Freiburg|University Library]])|left]] The university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600. Approximately 16% of these students are foreigners, from ca. 120 different countries. The admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German <a>Abitur</a>) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the Fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 out of approximately 26,000 applicants were admitted.</p>
<p>The University of Freiburg offers a large variety of <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>graduate</a>, and <a>postdoctoral</a> degree programs at its eleven faculties in 150 fields of study.</p>
<p>As common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from October 1 to March 31, while the summer term runs from April 1 to September 30. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall. </p>
<p>German universities enjoy government subsidies, so tuition fees are moderate. The University of Freiburg charges EUR 1210 per year for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students. </p>
<h3>Student life</h3>
<p>There are numerous student clubs and organizations, among them a student-run radio station, echo-fm, and a student television program, alma*, which is also available as a podcast. Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent <a>Black Forest</a>, where the university owns a retreat on <a>Schauinsland</a> Mountain, there are fine opportunities for leisure and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>The university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the <em>Stundentenwerk</em>. Additionally, there are further dormitories in Freiburg which are operated by other institutions, such as the <a>Catholic Archdiocese</a> or the <a>Evangelical Church</a>. Due to the affordable rent and limited spots, rooms in the various dormitories are very popular. Many students find private living arrangements, such as <em>Wohngemeinschaften</em> (shared apartments). However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms. </p>
<p>The university has its own <a>career center</a>, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the <em>Stifterverband f&#x00fc;r die Deutsche Wissenschaft</em>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Excellence Initiative</h3>
<p>[[Image:Jesuitenkirche (Freiburg).jpg|thumb|200px|[[University Church, Freiburg|University Church]]|right]] The university scored well with its submissions to the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>. The university received funding in all three categories. In the first category, funding for a new graduate school, the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, was granted; in the second, funding was granted for the excellence cluster Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (<em>bioss</em>); and in the third category, Institutional Strategy Line of Funding, open only to institutions with submissions qualified in the first two categories, the university is receiving funding for &quot;Windows for Research&quot;, which aims to promote a high level of interdisciplinarity between research fields and attract scientists from all over the world. To that end, the university founded the <a>Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies</a> (FRIAS). Being selected for the third category ranks Freiburg as one of nine &quot;excellence universities&quot; in Germany. The University is to receive over EUR 130 million in additional funds over five years (from 2007) from this third category funding. In 2009, the University was also successful in a nationwide competition for excellence in teaching, held by the <em>Stifterverband der deutschen Wissenschaft</em>. The University of Freiburg, with its plans for future innovative teaching concepts, was selected as one of ten winners from a field of over one hundred higher education institutions.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>In university rankings published by German magazines and periodicals (<a>Der Spiegel</a>, <a>Die Zeit</a>, <a>Focus</a>, etc.) the University of Freiburg has established itself as one of Germany's top universities. The faculties for law, medicine, economics, history, English studies, biology, dentistry, and pharmacology achieve especially high scores. In regards to the natural sciences, the University of Freiburg ranked 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany  The ranking results of various commonly referenced international rankings are shown below.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Current affairs</h3>
<p>Teams of the University of Freiburg frequently participate in academic competitions with considerable success. The moot court team of the Faculty of Law has already won the <a>Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot</a> twice. The humanoid robot team of the Faculty for Applied Sciences regularly competes with distinction in international tournaments.   The University of Freiburg team has also repeatedly scored highly at the <a>iGEM</a> undergraduate synthetic biology competition held at the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. The team was supported by numerous university institutions, among them the recently established <em>bioss</em> cluster of excellence. The University of Freiburg also participates in the <a>National Model United Nations</a> (NMUN) held annually in <a>New York City</a>, NY. </p>
<p>The genetically engineered <a>golden rice</a> was developed by the University of Freiburg and the <a>ETH Zurich</a> from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now helps to provide <a>Vitamin A</a> to people lacking access to it in their diet.</p>
<p>When previous rector Prof. Dr. J&#x00e4;ger retired in 2008, law professor Prof. Dr. <a>Andreas Vo&#x00df;kuhle</a> was chosen as his successor. However, shortly after the start of his term, the <a>Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> (SPD) nominated Vo&#x00df;kuhle as vice-president of the <a>Federal Constitutional Court of Germany</a>. Vo&#x00df;kuhle accepted the nomination, was confirmed and took his seat on the court in May 2008. In July 2008, then vice-rector Prof. Dr. Hans-Jochen Schiewer was elected as successor to Vo&#x00df;kuhle. Schiewer has assumed the position of rector with the start of the winter term 2008/2009.</p>
<p>The University of Freiburg offers educational audio and video content on the <a>iTunes U</a> software platform since January 2008.</p>
<h2>Organization and Faculties</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|&quot;Die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen&quot; (The truth will set you free).</a></p>
<p>Today, at the university there are about 430 professors, 3,695 academic employees and 8,644 non-academic employees working for the Albert Ludwigs University, making it Freiburg's and the region's biggest employer. The university attracts many academics from abroad and was awarded excellent positions in the 2005 and 2009 <em>Humboldt Ranking</em>,.</p>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p>The university is headed by a <a>rector</a> and divided into 11 faculties:</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Graduate Schools</h3>
<p>[[Image:Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies|FRIAS]] main building.]] The University of Freiburg has a variety of graduate education and research opportunities. In an evaluation of European graduate programs, Freiburg was ranked among the leading universities in several subject fields examined.</p>
<p>One of the notable graduate opportunities is the <a>Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies</a> (FRIAS), a project funded by the German Excellence Initiative.<em>(see</em> Current affairs and academics <em>above)</em></p>
<p>Apart from the many graduate programs of its faculties, Freiburg has set up additional specialized graduate schools and graduate research centers, coordinated by the newly founded <a>International Graduate Academy (IGA) Freiburg</a>. The IGA coordinates five <strong>Graduate Schools</strong>: the <a>Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM)</a>; the <a>European Cultures and Intercultural Interweaving</a> school; the <a>Theology and Religious Studies</a> school; the <a>Hermann Paul School of Language Sciences</a> and the <a>Environment, Society and Global Change graduate school</a> of the Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>The IGA also coordinates twelve <strong>Graduate Research Centers</strong> (<em>Graduiertenkolleg</em>): <a>Biochemistry of Enzymes</a>; <a>Friends, Patrons, Clients</a>; <a>Formation and Development of Present-Day Landscapes</a>; <a>Mathematical Logics and Applications</a>; <a>Mechanisms of Neuronal Signal Transduction</a>; <a>Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis</a> (in cooperation with the <a>University of Basel</a>); <a>Hadron Collider Physics</a>; <a>Embedded Microsystems</a>; <a>From Cells to Organs: Molecular Mechanisms of Organogenesis</a>; <a>Signal Systems in Model Organisms of Plant Origin</a>; <a>Micro Energy Harvesting</a>; and <a>PhD program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Freiburg</a></p>
<p>Finally, the university operates three <strong>joint graduate schools</strong> with the <a>Max Planck Society</a>: the <a>International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology</a>; the <a>International Max Planck Research School on Retaliation, Mediation and Punishment</a>; and the <a>International Max Planck Research School for Comparative Criminal Law</a>.</p>
<p>Together with the EUCOR universities of <a>Basel</a> and <a>Strasbourg</a> and the <a>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, the University of Freiburg also runs the shared graduate school <a>Ecole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg</a>, enabling the students to obtain an international degree in biotechnology and a trilingual education, as classes are taught in English, German, and French.</p>
<h3>International language courses</h3>
<p>The University of Freiburg has offered <a>German language</a> courses for foreign students since 1911. The courses take place at the university's Language Teaching Centre (<a>Sprachlehrinstitut, SLI</a>) during the semester breaks and attract students from over 50 nations to Freiburg. The intensive language lessons are bolstered by a supplementary program with lectures and seminars on <a>German culture</a>, <a>politics</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, and <a>art</a> as well as excursions to the <a>Black Forest</a>, the <a>Alsace</a> region in <a>France</a>, <a>Basel</a> (<a>Switzerland</a>) or <a>Lake Constance</a>. In addition to classes for all language levels, professional German courses (e.g. Business German) are also offered.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|The green at the central <em>mensa</em> (cafeteria) on Rempartstra&#x00df;e</a> The city of Freiburg is known for its environmentally friendly policies and focus on renewable energy and sustainability, attracting solar industry and research to the city. This environmentally conscious attitude also extends to the University of Freiburg which has founded the work group [<a>http://www.nachhaltige.uni-freiburg.de/welcome-to-the-sustainable-university-work-group-of-the-university-of-freiburg/view?set_language=en</a>&quot;Nachhaltige Universit&#x00e4;t Freiburg&quot;] (Sustainable University of Freiburg) and has drawn up environmental guidelines to be implemented in university practice. </p>
<p>The university has also founded the initiative <a>Solar-Uni Freiburg</a> in 2007, with the aim of further expanding its capabilities in sustainability and environmental research. Solar panels were installed on the roofs of university buildings. To bundle renewable energy research and teaching at the university, the <a>Center for Renewable Energy (ZEE, Zentrum f&#x00fc;r Erneuerbare Energien)</a>, an interdisciplinary and cross-faculty facility, was founded. Aside from research in the fields of solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy efficiency and new energies, an international <a>Master of Science</a> degree in Renewable Energy Management is being offered.</p>
<p>In addition to its own expertise, the Center for Renewable Energy can draw upon the support of the renewable energy industrial sector in Freiburg, as well as the university's cooperation with other research institutes in the area, such as the <a>Fraunhofer Institute</a> for Solar Energy Systems, the &#x00d6;ko-Institut - Institute for Applied Ecology, or the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg.</p>
<h2>University cooperation</h2>
<h3>Local partner institutions</h3>
<p>The University of Freiburg cooperates closely with external research institutions located in Freiburg, several of which are connected with chairs at the university. </p>
<p>Collaborating institutions include: </p>
<h3>International cooperation</h3>
<p>[[Image:University of Freiburg IEGM.jpg|thumb|250px|The Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine and the Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the [[University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]].|left]] The university is part of the regional <a>EUCOR</a> federation together with the <a>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, the universities of <a>Basel</a>, <a>Mulhouse</a>, and, marked by particularly close ties, <a>Strasbourg</a>. Freiburg is further a member of the <a>League of European Research Universities</a>; the <a>European University Association</a>; ASEA-Uninet; AC21; and the <a>International Forum of Public Universities</a> (IFPU). The university also has exchange agreements and cooperative efforts with renowned universities on almost every continent.</p>
<p>The University of Freiburg initiated an English language international master's program in <a>social sciences</a>, the <a>Global Studies Programme</a> (GSP) in 2001. The aim of the program is to enable students to study social sciences in different regions and cultures. Combining various disciplines such as <a>sociology</a>, <a>political sciences</a>, <a>anthropology</a> and <a>geography</a>, students approach globalization with a unique perspective. The program is conducted jointly by the University of Freiburg with the <a>University of KwaZulu-Natal</a> in <a>Durban</a>, <a>South Africa</a>, the <a>Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> in <a>New Delhi</a>, <a>India</a>, the <a>Latin American Social Sciences Institute</a> in <a>Buenos Aires</a>, <a>Argentina</a>, and the <a>Chulalongkorn University</a> in <a>Bangkok</a>, <a>Thailand</a>. Students in the GSP master's program study on three different continents during the two-year degree program. Since 2008, the GSP also offers a PhD program in Global Studies. The Global Studies Program has received many awards, among them the <a>BMW Group</a> Award for Intercultural Learning in 2004 as well as being listed a Top Ten International Master's Degree Course in Germany by the <a>German Academic Exchange Service</a> (DAAD) in 2006.</p>
