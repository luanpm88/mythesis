<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|150px|left|Keimyung University</a> Keimyung University originated from Keimyung Christian College, which was founded in March 1954, by Reverend Edward Adams, an American missionary of the Northern Presbyterian Church of the U.S., and by Reverends Choi Jaehwa and Kang Ingu, two local Presbyterian Church leaders. The founding principle guiding their concerted efforts was to provide Koreans with higher education firmly anchored in Christianity. The opening of the university also reflected the perceived need for higher education as a vehicle with which to reconstruct the war-ravaged nation and a means of perpetuating the time-honored spirit of the Korean people. 1978, the year of Keimyung's elevation to the status of a university, marked the beginning of a new period of rapid development. In October 1980, the university merged with the Dongsan Presbyterian Hospital, a prestigious local hospital with 81-year history of service, and re-opened it as Keimyung University Medical Center. The development of Keimyung acquired a new dimension in the early 1980s when it added a new campus built on 550,000 pyeong (181,500 sq. meters) at Seongseo in Sindang-dong, Dalseo-gu, to its existing Daemyeong and Dongsan campuses. As of March 2003, Keimyung comprises over 27,000 students and over 2,400 faculty members and employees in 25 majors, 68departments in 11 faculties and 20colleges, 13 graduate schools, 34 attached and affiliated institutes including Dongsan Medical Center and 17 affiliated research centers. Offering an academic atmosphere which fosters genuine learning and nourishment of intellectual pursuits, Keimyung is to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2004. When its ambitious plan for Seongseo Campus is brought to a fruition, Keimyung will be able to enjoy its second takeoff.</p>
