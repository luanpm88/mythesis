<p> </p>
<p><strong>Swansea University</strong> () is a <a>university</a> located in <a>Swansea</a>, <a>Wales</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a>. Swansea University was chartered as <strong>University College of Swansea</strong> in 1920, as the fourth college of the <a>University of Wales</a>. In 1996, it changed its name to the <strong>University of Wales Swansea</strong></p>
<p>It is the <a>third largest university in Wales</a> in terms of number of students. The university campus is located next to the coast at the north of <a>Swansea Bay</a>, east of the <a>Gower Peninsula</a>, in the grounds of <a>Singleton Park</a>, just outside <a>Swansea city centre</a>. Swansea was granted its own degree-awarding powers in 2005 in preparation for possible changes within the University of Wales.</p>
<p>Swansea and <a>Cardiff University</a> compete in an annual <a>varsity match</a>, known as the Welsh version of the <a>Oxbridge</a> event, which includes the <a>Welsh Varsity</a> rugby and <a>The Welsh Boat Race</a>.</p>
<h2>Governance and structure</h2>
<p>Swansea received its <a>royal charter</a> in 1920 and like many universities is governed by its <a>constitution</a> that is set out in its <a>statutes</a> and <a>charter</a>. The governing body of Swansea University is its Council, which, in turn, is supported by the Senate and the Court.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Council</strong> consists of 29 members including the Chancellor, Pro-chancellors, Vice-chancellor, Treasurer, Pro-vice-chancellors, staff and student members, city council representation and a majority of lay members.  The council is responsible for all of the University's activities and has a well-developed committee structure to help discharge its powers and duties.</li>
  <li><strong>The Senate</strong> consists of 200 members, the majority of whom are academics but includes also representatives from both the Students' Union and the <a>Athletic Union</a>. The senate is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, who is the head of the university both academically and administratively. The senate is the main academic body of the university and is responsible for teaching and research.</li>
  <li><strong>The Court</strong> consists of over 300 members, who represent the <a>stakeholders</a> in the university and stretch from local to national institutions. The court meets annually to discuss the university's annual report and its financial statements, as well as to discuss current issues in <a>higher education</a></li>

Almost 50 per cent of all research at Swansea University was assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent - 4* and 3*- the top two categories of assessment.</p>
<p>Within Wales, out of 31 subject areas submitted in the RAE, Swansea University came first in 17 areas, and first or second in 24 areas.</p>
<p>  The university was also a key partner in the successful <a>Thrust SSC</a> land-speed record attempt.</p>
<p>The university has a large connection with <a>CERN</a> and in particular the <a>Large Hadron Collider</a>, where Alumni <a>Dr Lyn Evans</a> is the project lead. At CERN, university staff were part of the first team to create antihydrogen </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The majority of university buildings are on the Singleton Campus, based in the grounds of <a>Singleton Park</a>, adjacent to <a>Swansea Bay</a>. The campus also includes the nearby Sports Village and Hendrefoelan Student Village, about 2.5 miles away.</p>

<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p>[[File:Digital Technium Swansea University.jpg|thumb|The Digital Technium houses Britain's most advanced [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|Virtual Reality cave]].]]</p>
<p>The University has restructured in recent years, expanding popular areas such as <a>History</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Geography</a> and Computer Science, but closing the Department of <a>Sociology</a> and <a>Anthropology</a>, and the Department of <a>Philosophy</a>. The Department of <a>Chemistry</a> has also ceased to take undergraduate students, although it continues to carry out research and post-graduate teaching. It is also proposed to cut over 50% of the modern foreign languages department[<a>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-11643561</a>]sparking outcry. Recent course additions include <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> as well as a partnership with <a>Cardiff University</a> to provide a four-year accelerated graduate-entry medical degree (MB BCh) in Swansea which was launched in 2004.  In 2007 Swansea University was awarded the four year course on its own.[<a>http://www.newswales.co.uk/?section=Health&amp;F=1&amp;id=13762</a>]</p>
<p>The Western Britain chapter of the International Conference for the Study of Political Thought was moved to the Department of Politics &amp; International Relations from Exeter University earlier in 2006.</p>
<p>In July 2007 the &#x00a3;52 million Institute of Life Science (ILS) opened as the research arm of the university's school of medicine. The ILS is based in a six-storey building housing laboratories, business incubation suites and an IBM Blue C supercomputer. The supercomputer is used for projects including numerically-intensive analysis of viral genomes, epidemiological modelling, large clinical databases and analysis of the genetics of disease susceptibility. In July 2009, an expansion of the ILS was announced with a &#x00a3;30m investment from Swansea University, the Welsh Assembly Government, the European Union and <a>Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board</a>. ILS2 is due for completetion in Summer 2011 </p>
<p>In November 2007, the University announced a collaboration with Navitas to found an International College - <a>International College Wales Swansea</a> to provide foundation, 1st year degree and Pre-Masters programmes on campus.  The first intake was September 2008.</p>
<h3>Boots Centre for Innovation</h3>
<p>[[File:Institute of Life Sciences Swansea University.jpg|thumb|The ILS Building contains the Boots Centre for Innovation and the [[Blue Gene|IBM Blue-C Supercomputer]].]]</p>
<p>Boots Centre for Innovation was created in April 2007 as a non profit making partnership between Boots the Chemist, Longbow Capital, Swansea University and the Welsh Assembly Government. The Centre was created to work closely with early stage companies or lone inventors to develop innovative new products and technologies within the health and beauty sectors, and to eventually launch new consumer products for the shelves of Boots stores.</p>
<h3>Campus Expansion</h3>
<p>In written evidence presented to the <a>Welsh Assembly's</a> Enterprise and Learning Committee in January 2008, the university stated that it was &quot;at an advanced stage of discussion&quot; about a new 'Innovation Campus' on a second site. The new campus could be home to Engineering, Computing, Telecommunications, the Business and Law Schools and a range of &quot;research/test facilities&quot; for large and small companies. One proposal is the development of a  site near Fabian Way at <a>Crymlyn Burrows</a>.</p>
<h2>University rankings</h2>
<p> <a>The Times</a> university 2008 Top 100 league table listed the university as the 46th best university in the UK, up from 50th position in 2004 but down from 42nd in 2005. The university picked up the 2005 Times Higher Education Supplement Award for the UK's &quot;best student experience&quot;. However, the survey was criticised by some, as it was carried out by the Student Panel making the sample self-selected and therefore unscientific. The university is also listed as one of the top 500 universities in the World at 401 to 500 in the 2006 <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University World Rankings</a>. Additionally, the 2008 Times Higher Education Supplement of World University Rankings places Swansea as 347th in the world, up from 401-500 in 2007. The Guardian league tables placed the university at 83rd in its institution wide table.</p>
<p>The Times Good University Guide 2005 places Swansea second to Cambridge out of 45 universities for Civil Engineering.. According to the latest national research assessment, Swansea University's Civil Engineering department is ranked 2nd in the UK behind Cambridge, but ahead of rivals Imperial College, Cardiff, Bristol, Southampton, Bath and Sheffield. Only Swansea and Cambridge are eligible for the new 6* rating now being applied to the English rating system.</p>
