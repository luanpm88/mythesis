<p><strong>M Des - Masters in Design (Multimedia Design)</strong></p>
<p>The <a>M.Des</a> The Master in Design (Multimedia) program is a full time two-year program. &lt;!-- THIS NEXT PART IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE WRITING STYLE IS SO COMPLEX THAT IT CONVEYS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION TO THE READER!!.............Responding to the growing need to design information products and services this multimedia Program seeks to unify concepts of communication, theories of the person and advances in computer technology into one. Usually Programs in multimedia are presented as discrete modules of technique without integration. But this Program seeks to embed the latest advances in technology within the philosophy of perception and cognitive psychology while providing students semiotic tools to increase aesthetic sensitivity. The courses offered seek to produce a student who blends technological acuteness with cultural sensitivity and design sensibility. Such hybridity is essential to the emerging markets of infotainment and the growing demand for new and innovative design solutions. The Program aims to bring students to an understanding of both the design and aesthetic components of Information and Communication Technology, as well as the social and cultural contexts which give it meaning and relevance.WOW!!!!!--&gt; The program is open to graduates of any discipline who have at least four years of education after completion of 10+2 or equivalent. &lt;!--THIS MEANS NEXT SENTENCE NOTHING EITHER!!......The program seeks to respond to the growing need to design information products and services in such a way that they become meaningful links to related knowledge base.--&gt; <a>thumb|Campus</a></p>
