<p><strong>Deakin University</strong> is an <a>Australia</a>n public <a>university</a> with 34,616 <a>higher education</a> students as of mid-year 2009. It has Campuses in <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Melbourne</a>, and <a>Warrnambool</a>, <a>Victoria</a>. The University is named after leader of the Australian federation movement and second <a>Prime Minister</a>, <a>Alfred Deakin</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deakin University was originally opened by Marc Deakin and is a commissioned Victorian university. Its establishment was the result of the commissioning of the <em>Ramsay Committee</em>, which was created by the State Government of <a>Victoria</a> and the Federal Government of Australia in September 1970, to establish Victoria's fourth university in regional Victoria. Three locations at <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Ballarat</a> and <a>Bendigo</a> were considered.</p>
<p>In its report on 14 December 1973, the Federal Government's Australian Universities Commission recommended that a university be established at Geelong. This led to the declaration of Deakin University as a university in 1974, by an Act of Parliament referred to as the <a>DEAKIN UNIVERSITY ACT 1974. Act No. 8610/1974</a>. Sites in Ballarat and Bendigo became independent Colleges of Advanced Education.</p>
<p>The University was officially opened in 1977 by the then Premier of Victoria Sir <a>Rupert Hamer</a> at the original Campus at Waurn Ponds, Geelong.</p>
<p>The three other commissioned Victorian universities include: <a>The University of Melbourne</a> (1853), <a>Monash University</a> (1958), and <a>LaTrobe University</a> (1964).</p>
<p>Upon establishment, Deakin took over the Waurn Ponds campus of the Gordon Institute of Technology (now the <a>Gordon Institute of TAFE</a>), and the institute's higher education courses. It also absorbed <em>State College of Victoria, Geelong</em> (a teacher's college). Deakin enrolled its first students at its Geelong Campus at Waurn Ponds in 1977.</p>
<p>Deakin remained a single Campus university for approximately 15 years until the Federal Government's <a>Dawkins Revolution</a> of higher education in the late 1980s came into effect. As a result, Deakin became a larger university by merging with the <a>Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education</a> in August 1990 and most of <a>Victoria College</a> in December 1991.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, debate ensued in Geelong about the fate of the city's historic waterfront woolstores, known as the Dalgety's Woolstores, which were dilapidated amidst an area undergoing major development. Some buildings were demolished despite a community outcry, and the fate of the remaining buildings was unclear until Deakin University acquired the site for a sixth Campus. Major renovations took place over several years, and in 1997, the Woolstores Campus (now the Geelong Waterfront Campus) opened.</p>
<p>The result of the amalgamations and developments created a large multi-campus University spanning 300 kilometres covering six Campuses: three in <a>Melbourne</a> in the suburbs of  <a>Burwood</a>, <a>Clayton</a> (<em>Rusden Campus</em>), and <a>Malvern</a> (<em>Toorak Campus</em>); two in <a>Geelong</a> at <a>Waurn Ponds</a> and Geelong Waterfront; and one at <a>Warrnambool</a>).</p>
<p>In 1993, the University established Victoria's third <a>law school</a>. Its establishment was unique, in that it was the first, and only, law school in Victoria to offer distance learning law degrees as well as traditional on-campus law degrees. The School's range of courses include <a>Bachelor of Laws</a>, <a>Master of Laws</a> and <a>PhD</a>. Two law school chapters were established, one each at the Burwood and Geelong Campuses respectively.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the University decided to close the Rusden Campus, which held mainly the Faculties of Environmental Science and Teaching. The Campus was progressively closed between 2001 and 2003, with students and courses relocated to the Burwood Campus. Rusden's buildings have been converted into student accommodation and now forms part of Monash University's Clayton campus.</p>
<p>On 8 April 2006 the then Prime Minister Mr <a>John Howard</a> announced that a new Medical School would be established at Deakin University. In his speech delivered at the Victorian Liberal Party State Council in Melbourne on 8 April 2006 he said: 'I am particularly pleased to announce the Medical School at Deakin University which will ensure the development of a strong rural and regional medical workforce throughout western Victorian region.'  </p>
<p>In 2007, the Toorak Campus in Malvern was closed and sold. Its resources and courses were relocated to new facilities at the Burwood Campus. At this point, the Burwood Campus became known as the Melbourne Campus at Burwood.</p>
<p>On 1 May 2008, Victoria's third Medical School was officially opened by the then Prime Minister of Australia Mr <a>Kevin Rudd</a> and the Victorian Premier Mr <a>John Brumby</a>. The Medical School commenced with 120 Commonwealth supported medical students. There are now three Medical Schools in Victoria with the first being established at The <a>University of Melbourne</a> in 1862, and subsequently <a>Monash University</a> in 1958.</p>
<p>In 2008   Deakin introduced a trimester system replacing the dual-semester system. It reflects Deakin's mission as an innovative and progressive university.</p>
