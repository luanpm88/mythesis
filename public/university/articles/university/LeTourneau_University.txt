<p> </p>
<p><strong>LeTourneau University</strong> (LETU) is a <a>private</a>, interdenominational, nerdy, homeschooler inhabited <a>Christian</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Longview</a>, <a>Texas</a> with flagship programs in engineering, aeronautical science, business and education (although the last two are regarded as something of a joke). The university also provides graduate and undergraduate degree programs for working adults online and at education centers around Texas in Austin, Bedford, Dallas, Houston, Longview and Tyler (these secondary location are unverified and there is much speculation as to their actual existence). </p>
<p>The university's vision statement reads: Claiming every workplace in every nation as their mission field (this marks a change from the previous and much better vision statement), LeTourneau University graduates are professionals of ingenuity and Christ-like character who see life's work as a holy calling with eternal impact (this is in no way a pun about the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs).</p>
<p>Founded as LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 by <a>R.G. LeTourneau</a> with his wife Evelyn, the school initially educated veterans returning from <a>World War II</a> but has grown into a nationally-recognized master's-granting university, as ranked in &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>. Total enrollment of LeTourneau University is over 3,200.</p>

<p><a>R.G. LeTourneau</a> founded LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 on the site of the recently-abandoned <a>Harmon General Hospital</a>, a <a>World War II</a> hospital specialized in treating servicemen with <a>neurological</a> and <a>dermatological</a> issues. LeTourneau bought the site from the <a>United States government</a> with the help of <em><a>Longview News-Journal</a></em> publisher <a>Carl Estes</a> and other Longview community leaders for one dollar with the conditions that for the next decade, the U.S. government could reclaim the 156 acres (631,000 m&#x00b2;) and 220 buildings in the event of an emergency and no new construction or demolition could occur. The United States government also insisted that LeTourneau establish a vocational school for war veterans on the premises.</p>
<p>The State of Texas chartered the school on February 20, 1946, and classes were first held on April 1. At that point, enrollment at LeTourneau was exclusively male and predominantly veterans. For the first two years, LeTourneau provided an academy section to allow the completion of the junior and senior years of high school as well as a college section that offered two-year tradeskill programs and a four-year technology program. Students attended classes on alternating days; while one half of the students were in class, the other half worked at R.G. LeTourneau's nearby <a>LeTourneau Incorporated</a> manufacturing plant, thus satisfying the laboratory requirements of all of the industrial courses.</p>
<p>From 1946 to 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute and LeTourneau, Inc. were one unified company under R.G. LeTourneau. In 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute underwent a transformation into the co-educational LeTourneau College and began to offer bachelor's degrees in engineering, technology, and a limited number of arts and sciences. At this point, the college began to transition from the traditional wooden barracks buildings. The Tyler Hall Dormitory for men was erected in 1962, the Margaret Estes Library in 1963 and the Hollingsworth Science Hall in 1965.</p>

<p>The college continued to grow under the leadership of Allen C. Tyler in 1961 and 1962 and Richard H. LeTourneau (eldest son of R.G. and Evelyn) from 1962 to 1968. Harry T. Hardwick's presidency from 1968 to 1975 saw to the construction of the R.G. LeTourneau Memorial Student Center and the Longview Citizens Resource Center along with spearheading LeTourneau's accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Richard LeTourneau again assumed the presidency from 1975 to 1985, during which time he oversaw the accreditation of the school's mechanical and electrical engineering programs by the Engineer's Council for Professional Development (now the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and supervised nine major construction projects. </p>

<p>LeTourneau College became LeTourneau University in 1989 under the leadership of President <a>Alvin O. Austin</a>, who served until 2007. Austin oversaw the development of an MBA program and the expansion of programs in business and education into educational centers in Houston, Dallas, Tyler, Austin and Bedford. Austin also oversaw the removal of all wooden barracks from the Longview campus except the historic landmark known as <a>Speer Chapel</a>, which is the only remaining WWII-era structure and is a popular place for weddings and ceremonies. Under Austin's leadership, the university's main campus underwent considerable improvements including the construction of the university mall and Belcher Bell Tower, the Solheim Recreation and Activity Center, the Glaske Engineering Center, seven new residence halls, and the <a>S.E. Belcher Jr. Chapel and Performance Center</a>, a 2,011-seat auditorium that opened in spring 2007.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2006, Austin announced that he would retire from his position as university president in June 2007 and assume the newly-created role of <a>university chancellor</a>. On March 8, 2007, Dr. <a>Dale A. Lunsford</a> was announced as the new president of LeTourneau University.  He assumed the office on July 1, 2007.  Prior to accepting the job as university president, Lunsford served as the vice president of student affairs and external relations at the <a>University of Texas at Tyler</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>At the core of LeTourneau University is an undergraduate program of 1,396 traditional students at its main campus in Longview. LeTourneau has a diverse pool of undergraduates, representing 50 states, 20 countries, and over 45 denominations. The average undergraduate <a>SAT</a> score is 1170 and LeTourneau undergraduates have an average of 3.5 high school GPA.  LeTourneau achieves annual rankings in <em>U.S. News and World Report<strong>s top tier for Master's/Comprehensive Universities and was cited as a &quot;Best Value&quot; in the 2009 rankings.</strong></em></p>
<p>The school offers numerous undergraduate degrees, most of which are focused on <a>engineering</a>, <a>aeronautics</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>business</a>, and <a>education</a>. A smaller liberal arts program provides educational balance to the largely technical concentrations. The school also offers extensive business and management graduate classes in <a>Houston</a>, <a>Dallas</a>, <a>Tyler</a>, <a>Bedford</a>, <a>Austin</a>, and Longview. At LeTourneau's satellite campuses, which are exclusively used for nontraditional students, women outnumber men with 70 percent of the total enrollment.</p>
<p>Caucasians make up 65.4 percent of the student body. African-Americans are the largest minority group, with 21.5 percent. Eight percent are Hispanic, 1.5 percent are Asian, and less than half a percent are Native American.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left|&lt;font size=2&gt;The LeTourneau University campus in 2003 as taken from the passenger seat of one of LeTourneau's Cessna training planes&lt;/font size=2&gt;</a></p>
<p>Longview, the seat of <a>Gregg County</a>, is located about a two-hour drive east of Dallas and about a one-hour drive west from <a>Shreveport</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>. The main campus itself is located on the south side of Longview, two miles north of Interstate 20 (exit 595B). Most of LeTourneau University's 1,400 traditional students live on campus; the school requires all unmarried students under the age of 22 (who are not living with parents or relatives during the school year) to live in residence halls and on-campus apartments or to apply for a special waiver to live off-campus. While Longview is home to a variety of neighborhoods, both in age and economic circumstance, LeTourneau is located in the middle of the highest poverty (26.1 % below poverty line based on 2000 census) and lowest income (median of $26,308 as of 2000 census) compared to 10 surrounding ZIP codes.</p>
<h2>LeTourneau campus life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Dorothy Speer Chapel at LeTourneau, Longview IMG_4010.JPG|200px|right|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;Dorothy Speer Chapel (reopened 1983) was the former Harmon Hospital chapel in the [[1940s]].&lt;/font size=2&gt;]]</p>
<p>Chapel services are held three times weekly, and frequent additional services are held at various points in the semester. Chapel attendance is mandatory; students are required to attend thirty-eight of the fifty to seventy services held during a semester. </p>
<p>Short 5-10 minute devotions are typically held before each class by the professor or a student.</p>
<p>The campus is completely networked; wired <a>Ethernet</a> connections are available in all residence halls, and wireless access is available in all academic buildings and most major residence halls. Internet access is also available in computer labs that are located in Longview Hall, the Glaske Center, and the Margaret Estes Library. </p>
<p>LeTourneau students maintain a unique culture that is heavily influenced by LeTourneau's predominantly technological concentrations.</p>
<h3>Intramurals</h3>

<p><a>200px|right|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;Quads 3 and 4, residence halls at LeTourneau&lt;/font size=2&gt;</a></p>
<p>In addition to official university sports, intramural competitions in soccer, <a>football</a>, volleyball, <a>ultimate</a> and basketball are also highly valued and widely popular. Somewhat unique to LeTourneau is the extensive amount of student pride and residence hall unity known as &quot;floor pride.&quot; Many floors in the residence halls have their own student-created name, logo, and t-shirt; these floors form teams that compete in intramural events.</p>
<h3>Floor system</h3>
<p>LeTourneau has a housing system similar to the <a>House System</a> with the use of numerous (roughly 30) individual floor assignments as opposed to four houses (which is closer to the <a>House System at Caltech</a>).  Housing is generally gender-segregated by building. In years where housing space is limited, one or two residence halls will have housing that is gender-segregated by floor.  Freshmen are placed into floors based upon both building preference and the order in which applications and deposits are received.  New students can request a particular floor through their application process, though some are placed at the discretion of Residence Life.  Many students remain on the same floor until they graduate from the university, only leaving to move off-campus or on-campus apartments rather than to join another floor.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>LeTourneau's &quot;Greek&quot; Societies</h3>
<p>LeTourneau hosts a variety of Greek Societies on campus.  Besides Greek Honor Societies, there are three independent Greek Fraternities and one independent Greek Sorority.  Of those, the fraternities <a>Lambda Alpha Sigma</a> (LAS), <a>Kappa Zeta Chi</a> (KZX), and <a>Alpha Omega</a> (AO) have charters from the University and have residence facilities on campus, whereas the Sorority Delta Omega Kappa (DOK) has a charter but no residence.  The Greek Society Residences of KZX, AO and LAS are unique in that they are owned by the university but were built with donations from alumni and friends. Neither LeTourneau's fraternities nor its sorority are part of national Greek organizations.  Tau Kappa Delta (TKD) and Delta Sigma Psi (DSP) lost their charters from the University.</p>
<p>There is also one non-&quot;Greek&quot; society on campus that is not part of the Intersociety Council: <a>Auto Society</a>, which operates much like the Greek societies.  Unlike KZK, LAS, and AO, Auto Society does not have a residence facility on campus but instead has a large automotive shop near the society houses.</p>
<h3>Other student activities</h3>
<p>LeTourneau has a variety of student-led foundations and a representative body of elected students known as the Student Senate (senate seats are allocated by residence hall or living area). A portion of each student's tuition and fees is allocated to Student Senate each year to distribute to spring break mission trips, campus activities, on-campus clubs, and other projects.</p>
<p>The Yellowjacket Activities Council (YAC), a university-sanctioned and funded student events committee, is responsible for planning and supervising several recreational &quot;student life&quot; activities each semester. Concerts, coffeehouses, midnight festivals, athletic competitions, off-campus events, movie nights, <a>paintball</a>, and <a>Valentine</a> parties are among the activities organized by YAC.</p>
<p>Homecoming at LeTourneau, while once being hosted in the fall with a talent and variety show along with other activities for returning alumni, is now hosted in the spring. A Starlight Soiree is held, as well as athletic events, including the annual intersociety rope pull competition, and Hootenanny.  </p>
<p>The traditional <a>Hootenanny</a> variety show brings together the majority of the student body, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the community for a dose of original comedy, music, and talent. The event is put on by individuals or groups of students who have auditioned in the weeks leading up to the show. 2005 marked the 40th anniversary of the Hootenanny production.  Traditionally, members of the school faculty and administration have also participated at the students' request, often in satirical roles.  &quot;Hootenuity 2007&quot; marked the end of using the Belcher Gym as the performance venue, with the new S.E. Belcher Chapel and Performance center slated as the new home for Hootenanny in the 2007-2008 school year. Because of this transition, the well-used rotating stage was destroyed and a two-story stage built to make use of the new facility.</p>
