<p> <strong>Adelphi University</strong> is a private, <a>nonsectarian</a> university located in <a>Garden City</a>, in <a>Nassau County, New York</a>. It is the oldest institution of higher education on <a>Long Island</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Adelphi College</h3>
<p>Adelphi University began with the Adelphi Academy, founded in <a>Brooklyn, New York</a> in 1863. The academy was a preparatory school located at 412 Adelphi Street, in the <a>Fort Greene</a> neighborhood of Brooklyn, but later moved to the corner of Lafayette Avenue and Clifton Place, in <a>Clinton Hill</a>. It was formally chartered in 1869 by the Board of Trustees of the City of Brooklyn for establishing &quot;a first class institution for the broadest and most thorough training, and to make its advantages as accessible as possible to the largest numbers of our population.&quot; One of the teachers at the Adelphi Academy was <a>Harlan Fiske Stone</a>, who later served as the <a>Chief Justice of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>In 1893, <a>Dr. Charles Herbert Levermore</a> was appointed as the head of Adelphi Academy. Seeking to establish a liberal arts college for the City of Brooklyn, Levermore received a charter from the Board of Regents of the State of New York, officially establishing Adelphi College on June 24, 1896. The college received its charter through the efforts of Timothy Woodruff, former Lieutenant Governor of New York and future first president of the Board of Trustees. Adelphi was one of the first coeducational institutions to receive a charter from the State of New York. At the time of its foundation, the college numbered only 57 students and 16 instructors. The Adelphi Academy continued to exist as a separate, but nonetheless connected entity to the college. The new college was located in a building behind the Adelphi Academy, on the corner of St. James's Place and Clifton Place, in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>In 1912, Adelphi became a college devoted exclusively to the education of women. In 1922, the school raised over one million dollars to expand the overcrowded facilities in Brooklyn. In 1925, Adelphi College severed its ties with the Adelphi Academy. In 1929, the college moved from its founding location in Brooklyn to the current location of its main campus in <a>Garden City, New York</a>. The original three buildings of the Garden City campus, Levermore Hall, Blodgett Hall, and Woodruff Hall, were designed by the famed architectural firm <a>McKim, Mead and White</a>. </p>
<p>In 1938, the Dance Program was founded by the world famous dancer <a>Ruth St. Denis</a>; it was the first dance program ever established at an American college. In 1943, the School of Nursing was established in response to the need for nurses due to American involvement in <a>World War II</a>; like the Dance Program, it was the first of its kind in the nation. First Lady <a>Eleanor Roosevelt</a> presided over the opening of two federally funded residence halls on campus, in a speech entitled &quot;The Challenge of Nursing for Young Women Today.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1946, after World War II ended, Adelphi reverted back to a coeducational college and started admitting new students on the federal <a>GI Bill</a>. New sports teams were created following the readmission of men to the school. In 1952, the first program for clinical psychology was established at the school&#x2014;another first in the nation; it was also the forerunner to the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies.</p>
<h3>Adelphi University</h3>
<p>In 1963, the <a>New York State Board of Regents</a> granted the college university status, and the name was changed to Adelphi University. In 1964, the School of Business was founded. In 1966, the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies was founded. In 1973, the University established ABLE (Adult Baccalaureate Learning Experience) for the education of adults. Now known as University College, it was one of the earliest programs created for nontraditional students. In 1984, the Institute for Teaching and Educational Studies was founded; it became the School of Education in 1990. In 1993, the Society of Mentors was established, giving students faculty advisors that they could consult on an as-needed basis to assist them in their studies. In 1995, the Honors College was founded.</p>
<p>Adelphi faced a serious scandal in 1996, as the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. University president Peter Diamandopoulos and the Board  of Trustees were accused of neglect of duty, misconduct and failure to carry out the educational purposes of Adelphi. The New York State Board of Regents was called in to investigate; Diamandopoulos, along with all but one of the Board of Trustees, was dismissed from office.  The university was in dire financial straits until the current president, Dr. <a>Robert A. Scott</a>, was installed in the position in 2000. Scott saved the school by decreasing tuition, increasing scholarships offered for the students, and launching an advertising campaign to increase enrollment. Since that time, the school has surpassed many of its previous gains, and is said to be undergoing a new renaissance. Adelphi University has been ranked as a &quot;Best Buy&quot; college by the Fiske Guide to Colleges for the last four years for its quality education offered at a comparatively affordable price. Adelphi University also participates in the <a>National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a> (<a>NAICU</a>)'s <a>University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN)</a>.</p>
<h2>Breast cancer support program</h2>
<p>The university's School of Social Work is home to the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program, which marks its 30th anniversary in 2010. The program began in 1980 as the Woman-to-Woman Hotline, a free and confidential service to help women with breast cancer. It is the second oldest breast cancer hotline in the United States; over 100 trained volunteers offer information and emotional support for women and men suffering from breast cancer. There are professional social workers, bi-lingual Spanish-speaking staff and support staff, along with support groups, educational programs and individual counseling.</p>
<h2>Levermore Global Scholars Program</h2>
<p>The Levermore Global Scholars Program (LGS) is a unique program of distinction at Adelphi University that brings together students interested in global studies and civic engagement  and committed to improving and understanding the world they live in. This innovative program emphasizes global learning, civic engagement, community service  in the local organizations, study and service abroad and scholars&#x2019; involvement in designing and leading their own initiatives with a social or global cause. Open to all majors, LGS selects students on the basis of their interest in global learning, study and service abroad, their experience with community work and their leadership potential.</p>

<h3>School seal</h3>
<p>The first school seal was developed with the foundation of the Adelphi Academy in 1869. Essentially, it was the current seal with several differences. First, the legend read &quot;Adelphi Academy&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn, New York&quot;. Second, the letters in the emblem were &quot;AA&quot;. Third, the eventual school motto, &quot;The Truth Shall Make Us Free&quot; did not appear. The motto was introduced in the second seal with the foundation of the college in 1896. At this time, the legend was changed to read &quot;Adelphi College&quot;, the letters &quot;AA&quot; were changed to &quot;AC&quot;, and the new date of foundation was introduced. The third seal removed the year 1869 from the emblem, reflecting the separation of the Academy and the college in 1925. The fourth seal was introduced in 1930 and changed the legend &quot;Brooklyn, New York&quot; to &quot;Garden City, New York&quot;. The fifth and current seal was introduced in 1963, reflecting the school's University status. The legend now reads &quot;Adelphi University&quot; and the letters are &quot;AU&quot;. The inscription <em>Vita sine litteris mors est</em>, meaning &quot;Life without learning is death&quot;, appears on all variations of the school seal.</p>

<p>Many of the buildings on the Garden City campus are symmetrical in nature. This is likely because <a>garden cities</a> are typically planned symmetrically. For example, Woodruff Hall has a second chimney solely to preserve the symmetry of the building. </p>
