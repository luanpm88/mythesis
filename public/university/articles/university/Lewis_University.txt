<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lewis University was founded in 1932 by the <a>Chicago Archdiocese</a> and <a>Bishop</a> <a>Bernard J. Sheil</a> as the <em>Holy Name Technical School</em>.  The school gets its name from philanthropist Frank J. Lewis who funded the construction of many of the school's buildings.  In 1934 it was renamed the <em>Lewis Holy Name Technical School</em>. The next year its name changed yet again to the Lewis Holy Name School of Aeronautics.  In 1940, the name of the school changed to the <em>Lewis School of Aeronautics</em>.  During <a>World War II</a>, normal classes were suspended as the campus was given to the <a>United States Navy</a> to train pilots.  Regular classes resumed in late 1944 and the college soon adopted a more traditional arts and science <a>curriculum</a>.  Women were admitted for the first time in 1949.  Three years later the school's name was changed to the <em>Lewis College of Science and Technology</em>.  The school's name was shortened to simply <em>Lewis College</em> in 1962 and finally received its current name of <em>Lewis University</em> in 1973.</p>
