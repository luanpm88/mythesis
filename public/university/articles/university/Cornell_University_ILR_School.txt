<p>The <strong>New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations</strong>&lt;!-- Please do not change from full name here, per NYS Education Law &#x00a7; 5715--&gt; (<strong>ILR</strong>) is an <a>industrial relations</a> school at <a>Cornell University</a>, an <a>Ivy League</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Ithaca, New York</a>, <a>USA</a>. ILR specializes in the fields of <a>human resource management</a>, <a>labor relations</a>, and <a>dispute resolution</a>.</p>
<p>Established by the state legislature in 1945, the school is a <a>statutory or contract college</a> and receives funding from the <a>State of New York</a>. It was the world's first school for college-level study in workplace issues and remains one of a handful of four-year undergraduate programs focused on work and employment. In addition to its undergraduate curriculum, the school offers professional and doctoral degrees, as well as executive education programs.</p>
<p>The school publishes the academic journal <em><a>Industrial and Labor Relations Review</a></em>, and its students independently oversee the <em>Cornell HR Review</em>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:ILR Conference Center Tower.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Bell tower|belfry]] atop the ILR Conference Center]] In 1944, a coalition of leaders in American <a>business</a>, <a>industry</a>, <a>labor</a>, <a>government</a>, and <a>education</a> formed to establish the school. They believed that a new type of school was needed that focused on issues involving the American workplace.</p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>More specifically, the State Legislature established the school  in 1945 based on the recommendations of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on Industrial and Labor Conditions.  This committee was headed by <a>Irving M. Ives</a> and was originally formed in 1938.  Ives, along with others in the committee, determined that a fundamental dysfunction in the relationship between management and labor was that each group brought different technical information and skills to the negotiating table and that these differences were hindering the formation of mutually favorable outcomes.  The committee&#x2019;s response to this observation was to recommend that the state of New York provide &#x201c;a common training program&#x201d; for representatives of labor and management.  The committee stressed that the importance of such a training program is &#x201c;not merely attendance at the same institution or in the same school, but rather mutual and cooperative analysis of the problems common to both groups.&#x201d;  Indeed, a quote from the committee&#x2019;s 1943 report adds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee believes [however] that a state-sponsored school in this state should be based upon a broader educational philosophy.  One of the most important ways of improving industrial and labor relations is to bring together, in a common training program, representatives of both labor and industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In other words, it was the committee&#x2019;s recommendation to provide common training to leaders from all perspectives of the management-labor debate.  It was hoped that this common training would stabilize the negotiating table by producing leaders on all sides who have common technical information and competencies.  In 1942 the committee recommended that ILR be established at <a>Cornell University</a> (the state&#x2019;s land grant institution).  Two years later, formal legislative action was taken and <a>Governor Dewey</a> approved establishing the school.  On July 1, 1945 ILR became a going educational enterprise.  The school was charged with the mission &#x201c;to improve industrial and labor conditions in the State through the provision of instruction, the conduct of research, and the dissemination of information in all aspects of industrial, labor, and public relations, affecting employers and employees.&#x201d;</p>
<h3>Patriarchs</h3>
<p>Mr. Ives was the first dean of the school.  However, soon after gaining this title he became a United States Senator for New York and left for Washington.  Beginning in the summer of 1947, Martin P. Catherwood became the dean  The school was also championed by, then Chancellor of <a>Cornell University</a>, <a>Edmund Ezra Day</a>.  The state of <a>New York</a> provided the school with generous funding. ILR soon had an established home at <a>Cornell</a>: facilities, multi-disciplinary faculty, and students, along with rapidly developing programs of study.  From the beginning, &#x201c;ILR embodied both the intellectual rigor of the <a>Ivy League</a> and the democratic spirit of <a>state universities</a>.&#x201d;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:Facade of Ives Hall.PNG|thumb|left|[[Ivy]] growing up the West wall of Ives Hall, one of the school's principal facilities for instruction]] The school was originally housed in <a>quonset hut</a>s, but later it moved into buildings vacated by the New York State College of Veternary Medicine. The current campus comprises Ives Hall, and the <a>Martin P. Catherwood Library</a>, which is one of only two official depository libraries of the <a>International Labour Organization</a> (the other being the <a>Library of Congress</a>). The school also occupies three linked buildings along Garden Avenue, which house research, conference center and extension. The buildings were built in 1911 for the Veternary College and are on a register of historic structures. From 2001-2004, the three buildings were extensively renovated by New York State. In 2008, the Extension Building was renamed Dolgen Hall.  In 1998, New York State replaced the portion of Ives Hall fronting along Tower Road with a new 110,605 sq ft building. Recently, the State also renovated the faculty wing of Ives Hall at a cost of $14 million. The school also has branches in Albany, Buffalo, New York City and Rochester.</p>
<h2>Organization and degree programs</h2>
<p>The school is divided into six departments: <a>Labor Relations, Law and History</a>, <a>Human Resource</a> Studies, International and Comparative Labor Relations, <a>Labor Economics</a>, <a>Organizational Behavior</a>, and <a>Social Statistics</a>.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate programs</h3>
<p>While most such schools offer only masters and PhD degrees in human resources or labor relations, Cornell is one of a few that offer a four-year undergraduate program focused on work and employment, the <a>B.S.</a> in Industrial and Labor Relations (BSILR). All students are required to complete a 120 credit hour curriculum with the following general requirements: First-year students are required to complete a two-semester writing seminar, Introduction to <a>Organizational Behavior</a>, History of American Labor, as well as <a>micro</a> and <a>macro</a> <a>economics</a>.  Sophomore year students have the following course requirements: statistical reasoning, labor and employment law, Human Resource Management, Collective Bargaining, and an economics seminar.  Junior and Senior level students are required to take 24 credits from within the school's six departments.  An additional 16 credits may be taken outside the school.  Additionally, there are <a>math</a> and <a>physical education</a> requirements. Twenty five percent of undergraduates go on to attend law school and another 10 percent earn an MBA or other advanced degree. Of the 911 undergraduates, 406 (45%) were New York State residents at the time they matriculated. New York residents pay a reduced in-state tuition.

<ul>
  <li><a>B.S.</a>/<a>M.S.</a>: ILR undergraduates with strong GPA (3.5 or above) are given the option to apply to this five-year program. Undergraduate students choosing this option are required to provide the same application materials as a candidate whose undergraduate work was done with a school other than ILR.</li>
  <li><a>B.S.</a>/<a>MBA</a>: Highly qualified undergraduates may apply to the <a>S.C. Johnson Graduate School of Management</a> for this five-year, dual-degree program.  <a>GMAT</a> scores must be submitted as part of the program application.  If accepted, the student is required to complete all requirements for the <a>B.S.</a> degree by the end of his/her junior year.  The fourth and fifth years are then spent completing requirements for the MBA degree.</li>
  <li><a>B.S.</a>/<a>MILR</a>: undergraduates may apply to <a>Cornell University Graduate School</a> for the 2-year professional MILR program.  Undergraduate students choosing this option are required to provide the same MILR application materials as a candidate whose undergraduate work was done at a different school.  They are also required to complete the MILR program's normal 48 credit hours.</p>
<p>Undergraduates have a number of intership opportunities, including semester-long for-credit internships. The school also sponsors non-credit internships over the January break or during the summer.</p>
<h3>Graduate programs</h3>
<p> These <a>graduate</a>-level degrees are offered through the <a>Graduate School</a>: [[File:Escp-London.jpg|thumb|right|Cornell [[MILR]] students may pursue a dual degree MIM or semester abroad at any of <a>ESCP's</a> campuses: <a>Paris</a>, <a>Torino</a>, <a>Berlin</a>, <a>Madrid</a>, or <a>London</a> (<em>pictured</em>).]]</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Master of Industrial and Labor Relations (MILR)</a>: Two-year professional degree for which students are required to complete 48 credit hours (16 courses): 6 core courses, 6 concentration courses, and 4 electives.  Students may choose one of five concentrations: <a>Human Resources</a> and <a>Organizations</a>, <a>Collective Representation</a>, <a>Dispute Resolution</a>, Labor Market Policy, or International and Comparative Labor.</li>
  <li><a>MILR</a>/<a>MBA</a>: Dual-degree program with the <a>S.C. Johnson Graduate School of Management</a>.  Termed the &quot;crown jewel for aspiring aspiring HR professionals,&quot; students must apply and be accepted to both programs.  One year is spent completing MILR core courses and electives.  One and a half years are then spent completing 45 credit hours of MBA instruction.</li>
  <li><a>Master of Professional Studies (MPS)</a>: Professional degree designed for students who &quot;are, or have been employed in human resources, dispute resolution, collective representation or other labor related fields and wish to upgrade their skills and understanding.&quot;  Completion of the program can occur in one year with full-time study, pending 30 credit hours of study and completion of an MPS project.  Study is offered at the <a>Ithaca</a> and <a>New York City</a> campuses. The Ithaca-based faculty also teaches a New York City based MPS program, which is designed for part-time students.</li>
</ul>
<p><a>M.S.</a>/<a>Ph.D.</a>: Both degrees are intended for students wishing to pursue an academic or research career in human resources or labor relations. The <a>M.S.</a> degree is normally completed in two years and culminates with a Master's thesis. The <a>Ph.D.</a> degree is begun after the student has completed a master's degree or other advanced degree in the social sciences and culminates in a doctoral dissertation.  The following major areas of study apply to both degree programs: <a>Collective Bargaining</a>, <a>Labor Law</a>, and <a>Labor History</a>; <a>Human Resource Studies</a>; International Comparative Labor; and <a>Organizational Behavior</a>.  The school offers two minor programs of study: <a>Social Statistics</a> and <a>labor economics</a>.</p>
<h2>Extension</h2>
<p>Since 1946, the school has participated in Cornell University's cooperative extension program, which reaches every county in the state. The school's extension program provides training and consulting services to both organized labor and management on contract negotiations, grievance handling, and employee relations. Since the 1990s the extension service has expanded into topics such as racial and gender diversity, health and safety, alcohol and substance abuse, regulatory compliance, and integrating persons with disabilities into the workforce.</p>
<h2>Activities and publications</h2>
<p>The school houses a number of research institutes, including the Martin and Laurie Scheinman Institute of Collective Bargaining, the Institute on Conflict Resolution, the Institute for Labor Market Policies, and the New York City-based Institute for Workplace Studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduate students publish the <em>Cornell HR Review</em> as an online journal. It does not have an announced frequency of publication. Since 1947, the school's faculty publishes a quarterly academic journal named <em><a>Industrial and Labor Relations Review</a></em>. Starting in 1952, the school conducted the <a>Liberia</a>n Codification Project under the direction of <a>Milton R. Konvitz</a>. Working with <a>Chief Justice</a> <a>James A. A. Pierre</a> of the <a>Supreme Court of Liberia</a>, Konvitz, for nearly 30 years, drew up the body of statutory laws in the <a>Republic of Liberia</a>. He also edited the opinions of Liberia's Supreme Court. As a token of thanks for his work Konvitz received the Grand Band of the Order of the Star of Africa, as well as an honorary degree from the <a>University of Liberia</a>.</p>
<p>The school also offers online learning courses and materials through <a>eCornell</a>.</p>
<p>The international program of the school hosts scholars from other nations to conduct research in Ithaca as visiting fellows.</p>
