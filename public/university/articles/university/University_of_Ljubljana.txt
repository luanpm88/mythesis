<p> The <strong>University of Ljubljana</strong> (<strong>UL</strong>) (, ) is the first and the largest <a>university</a> in <a>Slovenia</a>; with 64,000 enrolled graduate and postgraduate students, it is among the largest universities in Europe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Beginnings</h4>
<p>Although certain academies (notably of <a>philosophy</a> and <a>theology</a>) were established as parts of <a>Jesuit</a>-led higher education as early as the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the university as such had first been founded in 1810 under the named <strong>&#x00c9;coles centrales</strong> by the <a>French Imperial</a> administration of the <a>Illyrian Provinces</a>. The university was disbanded in 1813, when the <a>Austrian</a> Government regained control.</p>
<h4>The quest for a national university</h4>
<p>During the second half of the 19th century, several political claims for the establishment of a <a>Slovene language</a> university in Ljubljana were made. They gained momentum in the <a>fin de si&#x00e8;cle</a> era, when a considerable number of renowned <a>Slovene</a> academians worked throughout <a>Central Europe</a>, while ever more numerous Slovenian students were enrolled in foreign-language universities of the <a>Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, particularly in the <a>Austria</a>n and <a>Czech lands</a> (<a>Charles University in Prague</a> or <a>University of Olomouc</a>, of which Slovene philosopher <a>Franc Samuel Karpe</a> became the Rector in 1781). In the 1890s, a unified board for the establishment of a Slovenian university was founded, with <a>Ivan Hribar</a>, <a>Henrik Tuma</a>, and <a>Ale&#x0161; U&#x0161;eni&#x010d;nik</a> as its main leaders. In 1898, the <a>Carniola</a>n regional parliament established a scholarship for all those students who were planning a <a>habilitation</a> under the condition that they would accept a post at Ljubljana University when founded. In this way, a list of suitable faculty started to emerge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, unfavorable political circumstances prevented the establishment of the University until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the establishment of the <a>State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a> in 1918, the founding of the university became possible. On November 23, 1918, the first meeting of the Founding Board of Ljubljana University was called, presided over by <a>Mihajlo Rostohar</a>, professor of <a>psychology</a> at the <a>Charles University</a> in <a>Prague</a>. Together with <a>Danilo Majaron</a>, Rostohar convinced the <a>Yugoslav</a> central government in <a>Belgrade</a> to pass a bill formally establishing the university. The bill was passed on July 2, 1919; in late August, the first professor were appointed and on September 18 the full professors established the University Council, thus starting the normal functioning of the institution. The first lectures started on December 3 of the same year.</p>
<h4>First  decades</h4>
<p>[[Image:Univerza Ljubljana.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The main building of the university on the [[Congress Square]]]] In 1919, the University comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. The seat of the university was in the central <a>Congress Square</a> of Ljubljana in a building that had served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918. The building was first designed in 1902 by <a>Jan Vladimir Hr&#x00e1;sky</a>, and was later remodelled by a <a>Czech</a> architect from <a>Vienna</a>, <a>Josip Hudetz</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid 1920s, the university was renamed the &quot;<a>King Alexander</a> University in Ljubljana&quot; (<em>Universitas Alexandrina Labacensis</em>) and continued to grow and develop both in size and quality despite financial troubles and constant pressure from Yugoslav governments&#x2019; <a>centralist</a> policies. In the 1930s, the university became the platform for numerous student activities, both cultural and artistic as political. In 1941, <a>Jo&#x017e;e Ple&#x010d;nik</a>'s <a>National and University Library</a> was completed, as one of the major infrastructure projects of the University in the interwar period. After the <a>invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, the University continued to function under the <a>Italian and Nazi German occupation</a>, despite numerous problems and interference in its autonomous operation. Several professors were arrested or deported to <a>concentration camps</a> and large numbers of students joined either the <a>Liberation Front of the Slovenian People</a> or the <a>Slovenian Home Guard</a>.</p>
<h4>After 1945</h4>
<p>Following the end of the WW2 the first and only foreigner was elected to hold the office of the Rector - he was the Czech professor Alois Kr&#x00e1;l, who had lectured at Faculty of Technical Sciences since 1920 and also held the position of dean thereof four times. After the establishment of Communist <a>Yugoslavia</a> in 1945, the university was again put under political pressure: numerous professors were dismissed, some were arrested and tried, and the Theological Faculty was excluded from the University. Some of the most brilliant students emigrated. Nevertheless, the University managed to maintain its educational role and even regain a limited degree of autonomy from the mid 1950s onward. In the 1960s and early 1970s it again became a lively platform for various student activities. It suffered a serious setback in autonomy from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s, when some professors were again dismissed by the authorities. In 1979 it was renamed &quot;<a>Edvard Kardelj</a> University in Ljubljana&quot; after the Communist leader. In 1990, with the fall of Yugoslavia, it was regiven its original name. </p>
<p>Since the mid 1980s, the university has managed to expand and catch up with advanced Western currents in all fields. Despite increasing competition from other Slovenian universities, it remains the largest and central institution of higher education in the country. On a domestic and international level, the study courses run at the University of Ljubljana and its projects follow the latest world discoveries and trends in the field of arts, science and technology, to which the contribution of numerous Slovenian professors and researchers is of great importance.</p>
