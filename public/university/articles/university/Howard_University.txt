<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Main Hall and Miner Hall in 1868. Miner Hall is located to the left.</a>  In November 1866, shortly after the end of the Civil War, members of The First Congregational Society of Washington considered establishing a theological seminary for the education of African-American clergymen. Within a few weeks, the project expanded to include a provision for establishing a university. Within two years, the University consisted of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Medicine. The new institution was named for General <a>Oliver Otis Howard</a>, a Civil War hero, who was both the founder  of the University and, at the time, Commissioner of the <a>Freedmen's Bureau</a>. Howard later served as President of the university from 1869-74.</p>
<p>Congress chartered Howard on March 2, 1867, and much of its early funding came from endowment, private benefaction, and tuition.  An annual congressional appropriation administered by the <a>U.S. Department of Education</a> funds Howard University and Howard University Hospital.</p>
<p>Howard University has played an important role in <a>American history</a> and the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> on a number of occasions. <a>Alain Locke</a>, Chair of the Department of Philosophy and first <a>African American</a> <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>, authored <em><a>The New Negro</a></em>, which helped to usher in the <a>Harlem Renaissance</a>. <a>Ralph Bunche</a>, the first <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> winner of African descent, served as chair of the Department of <a>Political Science</a>.  <a>Stokely Carmichael</a>, also known as <a>Kwame Toure</a>, a student in the Department of <a>Philosophy</a> and the Howard University School of Divinity coined the term &quot;<a>Black Power</a>&quot; and worked in <a>Lowndes County</a>, <a>Alabama</a> as a <a>voting rights</a> activist. Historian <a>Rayford Logan</a> served as chair of the Department of <a>History</a>. <a>E. Franklin Frazier</a> served as chair of the Department of <a>Sociology</a>. <a>Sterling Allen Brown</a> served as chair of the Department of <a>English</a>. </p>
<p><a>Thurgood Marshall</a> wanted to apply to his hometown law school, the <a>University of Maryland School of Law</a>, but was told that he would not be accepted due to the school's <a>segregation</a> policy. Marshall enrolled at <a>Howard University School of Law</a> instead.  There he studied under <a>Charles Hamilton Houston</a>, a <a>Harvard Law School</a> graduate and leading civil rights lawyer who at the time was the dean of Howard's law school. Houston took Marshall under his wing, and the two forged a friendship that would last for the remainder of Houston's life. Howard University was the site where Marshall and his team of legal scholars from around the nation prepared to argue the landmark <em><a>Brown v. Board of Education</a></em> case.</p>
<p>In 1918, all the secondary schools of the university were abolished and the whole plan of undergraduate work changed.  The four-year college course was divided into two periods of two years each, the Junior College, and the Senior Schools.  The semester system was abolished in 1919 and the quarter system substituted.  Twenty-three new members were added to the faculty between the reorganization of 1918 and 1923.  A dining hall building with class rooms for the department of home economics was built in 1921 at a cost of $301,000.  A <a>greenhouse</a> was erected in 1919. Howard Hall was renovated and made a dormitory for girls; many improvements were made on campus; J. Stanley Durkee, Howard's last white president, was appointed in 1918. </p>
<p>In 1965, President <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive <a>affirmative action</a> to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities.</p>
<p>In 1975 the historic <a>Freedman's Hospital</a> closed after 112 years of use as <a>Howard University College of Medicine</a>'s primary teaching hospital.  Howard University Hospital opened that same year and continues to be used as Howard University College of Medicine's primary teaching hospital with service to the surrounding community.</p>
<p>In 1989, Howard gained national attention when students rose up in protest against the appointment of then-Republican National Committee Chairman <a>Lee Atwater</a> as a new member of the university's Board of Trustees. Student activists disrupted Howard's 122nd anniversary celebrations, and eventually occupied the university's Administration building. Within days, both Atwater and Howard's President, <a>James E. Cheek</a>, resigned.</p>
<p>In April 2007 the head of the faculty senate called for the ouster of Howard University President <a>H. Patrick Swygert</a>, saying that the school was in a state of crisis and it was time to end &#x201c;an intolerable condition of incompetence and dysfunction at the highest level.&#x201d; This came on the heels of several criticisms of Howard University and its management. The following month, Swygert announced that he would retire in June 2008. The university announced in May 2008 that <a>Sidney Ribeau</a> of <a>Bowling Green State University</a> would succeed Swygert as president. Ribeau appointed a Presidential Commission on Academic Renewal to conduct a year-long self-evaluation that resulted in reducing or closing 20 out of 171 academic programs.</p>
