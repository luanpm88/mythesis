<p>  The <strong>Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda</strong>, commonly referred as <strong>M. S. University</strong> (MSU) is one of the premier universities of <a>India</a> located in the city of <a>Vadodara</a>, (<a>Baroda</a>) in <a>Gujarat</a> state. Originally known as the <a>Baroda College</a> of Science (established 1881), it became a university in 1949 after the independence of the country and later renamed after <a>Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III</a>, the former ruler of <a>Baroda</a>. It is a teaching and residential university. It is the only university in Gujarat whose medium of instruction is English for all its courses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University has its origins in the <a>Baroda college</a> established in 1881 by <a>Baroda State</a>. The main building which now houses the faculty of Arts was designed by  Robert Fellowes Chisholm (1840-1915) in <a>Indo-Saracenic architecture</a> style, in a fusion of Indian and Byzantine arches and domes in brick and polychromed stone. The main dome on the convocation hall, was modelled after the great dome of the <a>Gol Gumbaz</a> in <a>Bijapur</a>..</p>
<p><a>Pratap Singh Gaekwad of Baroda</a> (1908&#x2013;1968), the  last Maharaja of the erstwhile <a>Baroda State</a> founded the university in 1949 as per the wishes of his grandfather, <a>Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III</a> (1863&#x2013;1939), and settled the &quot;Sir Sayajirao Diamond Jubilee and Memorial Trust&quot; which exists to date, and caters to the educational and other needs of the people of the former <a>Baroda State</a>.

<p>Maharaja Sayajirao Rao Gaekwad was a patron of Indian classical music. Ustad Moula Bux founded the Academy of Indian Music under the patronage of Sayajirao. This academy later became the Music College and is now the Faculty of Performing Arts of MSU. Apart from <a>Moula Bux</a>, Sayajirao&#x2019;s Court boasted of artists like Ustad <a>Hazrat Inayat Khan</a> and Ustad Faiyyaz Khan.</p>

It was later absorbed into the university that bears his name. Chimnabai I was knowledgeable in Bharatanatyam and carnatic music and brought a troupe with her: two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts), and two teachers. Others followed later: nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, two members of the Tanjore Quartet. After Appaswamy's death in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Kubernath , left to teach in Lucknow and worked in film in South India until Maharaja Pratap Singhrao Gaekwad called the Tanjorkars family back to Baroda in 1949, to teach in the music fepartment in the Palace Kalavan which was later absorbed into MSU.</p>
