<p><strong>The Peoples' Friendship University of Russia</strong> (<a>Russian</a>: &#x0420;&#x043e;&#x0441;&#x0441;&#x0438;&#x0439;&#x0441;&#x043a;&#x0438;&#x0439; &#x0443;&#x043d;&#x0438;&#x0432;&#x0435;&#x0440;&#x0441;&#x0438;&#x0442;&#x0435;&#x0442; &#x0434;&#x0440;&#x0443;&#x0436;&#x0431;&#x044b; &#x043d;&#x0430;&#x0440;&#x043e;&#x0434;&#x043e;&#x0432;, &#x0420;&#x0423;&#x0414;&#x041d;) is an educational and research institution located in the South of <a>Moscow</a> and is ranked by the Ministry of Education of Russia as the country's third-best university  after <a>Moscow State University</a> and <a>Saint Petersburg State University</a>. It was founded in <a>1960</a> as <strong>Peoples' Friendship University</strong> (). Its stated objective at the time was to help nations of the <a>Third World</a>, mainly in Asia, Africa and South America, at the height of the <a>Cold War</a> by providing higher education and professional training, but many students also attended from the developed countries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Peoples&#x2019; Friendship University was established by the government of the <a>Soviet Union</a> on February 5, 1960. The Soviet government decided to establish Peoples&#x2019; Friendship University in response to the requests of former colonial countries. On February 22, 1961, it was renamed in honour of <a>Patrice Lumumba</a>, the leader of what later became the <a>Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, who had been overthrown and murdered in a coup only days earlier. In the first year, 539 foreign students from 59 countries were enrolled (plus 57 Soviet students).</p>
<p>In February 1975, the University was awarded the <a>Peoples&#x2019; Friendship Order</a> for contributions in human development of Asian, African and Latin American countries.</p>
<p>On February 5, 1992 the university was renamed 'Peoples&#x2019; Friendship University of Russia &#x2013; State Institute of Higher Education (PFUR)'. The founder of the PFUR is the government of the <a>Russian Federation</a>.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The stated purpose of establishing this university was to give young people from Asia, Africa and Latin America, especially from poor families, an opportunity to be educated and to become highly qualified specialists.</p>
<h2>Founders</h2>
<p>The organizations that have been mentioned as founders of the university are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All-Union Central Soviet of Trade Unions</li>
  <li>Soviet Committee of Asian and African Countries Solidarity </li>
  <li>Soviet Associations Union of Friendship and Intercultural Relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Today, more than 97,000 graduates work in approximately 165 different countries around the world. The university has 57 programmes with about 35,000 students (including postgraduates) of 450 nationalities&lt;!-- from 161 countries--&gt;. About 15,000 of the current students are from outside the <a>Russian Federation</a>, while more than 1,000 are from autonomous regions inside the Russian Federation.&lt;!-- it is entirely possible to have two differing numbers here for the different countries since one discusses those who have graduated and the other discusses those that may be currently taking classes, but have not yet graduated.  However, I've commented out the last country indication for now. (Also, a nationality is not necessarily a country...)--&gt;</p>
<p>The University staff includes about 7,000 employees; among them there are 732 professors and Doctors of Science, 807 associate professors and candidates of science, 91 academicians and Corresponding Members of academies of Russia, 50 Honoured workers of Science of the Russian Federation, 56 PFUR teachers and professors are full members of international academies and learned societies, as well as other general employees.</p>
