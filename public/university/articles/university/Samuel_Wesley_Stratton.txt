<p> <strong>Samuel Wesley Stratton</strong> (July 18, 1861 &#x2013; October 18, 1931) was an administrator in the American government, physicist, and educator.</p>
<p>Stratton was born on farm in <a>Litchfield, Illinois</a> on July 18, 1861. In his youth he kept farm machinery in repair and worked as a mechanic and carpenter. He worked his way through <a>Illinois Industrial University at Urbana</a> (later the University of Illinois), receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1884. He became an instructor in mathematics and physics there, organized the department of electrical engineering and became its first head. By 1889 he was Professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering. He moved to the <a>University of Chicago</a> in 1892 as Assistant Professor of Physics, then Associate Professor in 1895 and Professor in 1898. </p>
<p>Stratton served in the <a>Illinois Naval Militia</a> from 1895, as a Lieutenant in the Navy in the <a>Spanish-American War</a>, and from 1904 to 1912 served as Commander in charge of the <a>Naval Militia</a> in the <a>District of Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1899 he was asked to head the <a>U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey's</a> Office of Weights and Measures, where he developed the plan for the establishment of a bureau of standards. He won the support for his plans from Secretary of the Treasury <a>Lyman J. Gage</a> and in March 1901, President <a>William McKinley</a> appointed him the first director of the <a>National Bureau of Standards</a>. He served until 1923. Under his leadership it grew from 24 to 900 employees scattered over 14 buildings. His operation was designed to recruit recent college graduates, train them, and feed them into private industry and its higher salaries. His team was called &quot;lowest-paid corps of first-rank scientists ever assembled by any government.&quot; The Bureau worked hand in glove with industry to undertake research that the private sector required but could not finance itself.</p>
<p>He was awarded the <a>Elliott Cresson Medal</a> of <a>The Franklin Institute</a> in 1912.</p>
<p>President <a>Herbert Hoover</a> used occasion of Stratton's departure from government service as an opportunity to bemoan the low salaries paid to government scientists.</p>
<p>In January 1923 he became the eighth president of <a>M.I.T.</a> and served for seven years. In his inaugural address he said: &quot;The terms pure and applied science have not the same distinction as formerly. The same men, methods and equipment are involved in getting at the facts, whether they are needed in solving problems in industry or in extending our knowledge of principals. There are few cases of the latter that do not find immediate application.&quot; Tying education to industry, he said that industry that had once been slow to seize upon scientific advances was now demanding them. As recounted by <em>Time</em> magazine, &quot;he demonstrated the economic wisdom of generous support for research in pure science. He said that the automotive industry must find a substitute for gasoline, on which the elder Edison commented that the electric storage battery has already filled the bill. Edison looks for all transportation and industry to be electrified.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1927, he served as one of three members as an Advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor <a>Alvan T. Fuller</a>, along with President <a>Abbott Lawrence Lowell</a> of Harvard and Probate Judge <a>Robert Grant</a>. They were tasked with reviewing the trial of <a>Sacco and Vanzetti</a> to determine whether the trial had been fair. Stratton, the one member who was not a Boston Brahmin, maintained the lowest public profile of the three committee members and hardly spoke during its hearings.</p>
<p>Upon his retirement in 1930 he became the first chairman of the MIT Corporation under a new plan of organization that he had devised. A lifelong bachelor, Stratton belonged to numerous private clubs. The carpentry he learned in his youth remained a lifelong hobby.</p>
<p>France made him a Chevalier of the <a>Legion of Honor</a> in 1909, and he received honorary degrees from the <a>University of Cambridge</a> and <a>Yale University</a> among others.</p>
<p>On October 18, 1931, he died of heart disease at his home in <a>Boston's Back Bay</a> while dictating a tribute to his friend <a>Thomas Edison</a>, who died earlier in the day.</p>
<p>He is buried at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in <a>Altadena, California</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Commerce Department&#x2019;s</a> <a>National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, formerly the National Bureau of Standards, has presented the Samuel Wesley Stratton Award annually since 1962 for outstanding scientific or engineering achievements in support of the objectives of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p>Note that the <a>Stratton Student Center</a> on the MIT campus is dedicated to a different former president of MIT, <a>Julius Adams Stratton</a>.</p>
