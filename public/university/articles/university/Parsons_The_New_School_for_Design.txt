<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Portrait of William Merritt Chase from 1900</a>  First established as the Chase School, the institution was founded in 1896 by the American impressionist painter <a>William Merritt Chase</a>. Chase led a small group of Progressives who seceded from the Art Students League of New York in search of a more free, more dramatic, and more individual expression of art. The Chase School changed its name in 1898 to the New York School of Art.</p>
<p>In 1904, <a>Frank Alvah Parsons</a> joined Chase; six years later, he became the School's president. Anticipating a new wave of the Industrial Revolution, Parsons predicted that art and design would soon be inexorably linked to the engines of industry. His vision was borne out in a series of firsts for the School, establishing the first program in <a>Fashion Design</a>, <a>Interior Design</a>, <a>Advertising</a>, and <a>Graphic Design</a> in the <a>United States</a>. In 1909, the school was renamed the New York School of Fine and Applied Art to reflect these offerings. Parsons became sole director in 1911, a position which he maintained to his death in 1930. <a>William M. Odom</a>, who established the school's Paris Ateliers in 1921, succeeded Parsons as president. In honor of Parsons, who was important in steering the school's development and in shaping visual-arts education through his theories about linking art and industry throughout the world, the institution became Parsons School of Design in 1936.</p>
