<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lakehead University evolved from Lakehead Technical Institute (founded 1946) and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology (founded 1957). </p>
<p><em>Lakehead Technical Institute</em> was established on June 4, 1946, by an Order-in-Council of the Province of <a>Ontario</a>. Classes commenced in January 1948, in temporary rented quarters in downtown <a>Port Arthur</a>. In September of that same year, the first university courses were added to the curriculum.</p>
<p><em>Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology</em> was established by an Act of the <a>Ontario Legislature</a> proclaimed on August 1, 1957. Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences.  The Lakehead University Act, 1965, was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The <em>Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology</em>, thereafter known as &quot;Lakehead University,&quot; was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965.</p>

<p>The original college site comprised some 32 hectares of land in south-west <a>Port Arthur, Ontario</a>. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land were purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.</p>

<p>In 2005 the <a>Northern Ontario School of Medicine</a> (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and <a>Laurentian University</a> in <a>Sudbury</a>. NOSM is organised within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across <a>Northern Ontario</a>, including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses.</p>
<p>Lakehead University is home to one of the top Ancient-DNA laboratories in the world. The Paleo-DNA Laboratory was the first university affiliated laboratory in Canada to become accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for forensic DNA testing. Lakehead University Paleo-DNA Laboratory has gained recognition for work done in its state-of-the-art facility on a wide array of subjects, such as the remains from Titanic victims, and most recently the DNA samples used in the documentary &#x201c;The Lost Tomb of Jesus.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Lakehead University's physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds. The current value of land and property holdings is estimated to be well over $150,000,000.</p>
