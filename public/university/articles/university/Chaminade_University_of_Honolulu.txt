<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Chaminade University of Honolulu is named after the founder of the Society of Mary, Father William Joseph Chaminade, a survivor of the French Revolution persecutions of Catholic leaders. Beatified by Pope John Paul II on September 3, 2000 with the title of Blessed Chaminade, his feast day is celebrated on January 22.</a></p>
<p>Chaminade University of Honolulu was named after Father <a>William Joseph Chaminade</a>, a <a>French</a> Catholic priest who survived persecution during the <a>French Revolution</a>.  He founded the Society of Mary in 1817.  In 1849, Marianists sent missionaries to the United States to serve immigrant populations.  In September 1883, eight Marianist priests arrived in Honolulu and established Saint Louis School, today a high school for boys.  With the encouragement of Saint Louis alumni, the Marianists established a university to serve the educational needs of local <a>Hawai'i Catholics</a>.  They opened Saint Louis Junior College in 1955.  Upon becoming a four-year institution, the school changed its name to Chaminade College in 1957.  When graduate programs were added in 1977, Chaminade College changed its name to Chaminade University of Honolulu.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Chaminade operates the Wiegand Observatory, which opened in 2003.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The Nursing Program was approved by the Hawai'i State Board of Nursing in March 2010. Named the Sallie Y. Miyawaki School of Nursing, Chaminade's four-year program will provide a contemporary curriculum characterized by sophisticated, simulated patient care experiences, informatics, genomics and cultural competency.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Chaminade University of Honolulu competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (<a>NCAA</a>) Division II as a member of the <a>Pacific West Conference</a>, a nine member athletic conference with members located in <a>Arizona</a>, <a>California</a>, <a>Hawaii</a>, <a>Utah</a>. Chaminade University fields teams in basketball, cross country and golf for men and cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball for women. In the fall of 2006 men's and women's soccer were added for the first time as well as women's basketball.  Chaminade University of Honolulu's team name is the &quot;<a>Silverswords</a>,&quot; a reference to a Hawaiian plant prized for its beauty and ability to withstand harsh conditions. </p>
<p>In 1982, Chaminade (led by Larry &quot;hook shot&quot; Larsen and his twin brother Lauren &quot;left-eye&quot; Larsen), then a member of the <a>NAIA</a>, defeated <a>Virginia</a> in what is considered the biggest upset in college basketball history.  Virginia, which featured <a>Ralph Sampson</a> and <a>Rick Carlisle</a>, was the top-ranked team in NCAA Division I basketball entering the game after posting victories against <a>Georgetown</a> (with <a>Patrick Ewing</a>) and <a>Phi Slama Jama</a> of <a>Houston</a>.  But in the <a>Blaisdell Arena</a>, the 3,500 fans in attendance &mdash; most of whom had come to see the nation's #1 team &mdash;  witnessed the historic 77&ndash;72 upset.  Many newspapers reportedly checked sources several times to make sure the story was right &mdash; that 800-student NAIA Chaminade had actually defeated the NCAA's top-ranked Virginia. Chaminade was later defeated in the finals by <a>Olivet Nazarene University</a>.</p>
<h3>Maui Invitational</h3>
<p>Chaminade hosts the annual men's tournament, the <a>Maui Invitational Tournament</a>.  They are usually the only team that competes in the tournament that is not a NCAA Division 1 basketball program.</p>
