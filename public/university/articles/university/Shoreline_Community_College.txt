<p><strong>Shoreline Community College</strong> is a <a>community college</a> in <a>Shoreline</a>, north of <a>Seattle</a>, <a>Washington</a>. It is located in a residential area east of Shoreview Park.  The college contains 83 acres (340,000 m&#x00b2;) and continuously serves 12,000 full and part-time students.</p>
<p>Shoreline Community College (SCC) has been operating for over 40 years, offering a wide variety of degree and certificate programs. Faculty and professional staff help students choose between two transfer degrees and more than 50 professional-technical programs, some short-term, others taking up to two years to complete. Career training, worker retraining, WorkFirst, Running Start, CEO and Study Abroad programs are a few of the other educational opportunities offered by SCC.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Some elements of SCC's architecture and landscaping are reminiscent of Japanese traditions. Note the high roof element and the rocks representing a stream as in a traditional Japanese garden.</a> Shoreline Community College was the brain-child of Dr. Ray W. Howard, <a>Superintendent</a> of the <a>Shoreline School District</a>.  He felt that Washington state's increasing host of high school graduates did not have adequate opportunities for higher education, and in 1959 he brought forward the idea of a community college in Shoreline.</p>
<p>After several years of research and development, Shoreline Community College began operations on January 2, 1964.  Dr. Howard resigned his position as superintendent to serve in the temporary position of Administrative Officer of Shoreline Community College until the college had hired its first president, William K. Ramstad.</p>
<p>During its first two years, evening classes were held at <a>Shoreline High School</a> until the college had established its permanent campus.  Initial enrollment comprised 850 students. Through local levies and a grant from the <a>Washington State Board of Education</a>, the college was able to purchase land from the <a>Boeing family</a>, and construction of the campus began in the fall of 1964.  The campus opened to students in January, 1966.</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p>The Ray Howard Library provides books, academic journals, newspapers, DVDs, CDs, and other media to students, staff, faculty and Shoreline community members.  Users can access many academic databases from on campus or at home.  Twenty-five open-access computers with library resources, Internet access and Microsoft Office grace the main floor of the library, along with a teaching lab.  Students can also check out digital cameras, flip cameras and lap top computers.  On the lower level, there are 100 computers for student use in the Student Lab, as well as a Media Lab for faculty to experiment with and build new ways of teaching and learning.  The Library also houses eLearning, the department that helps students and faculty with their online learning needs.  Shoreline's reference librarians provide in-depth, friendly help for learners who are doing research.  The librarians teach workshops, consultations and individual sessions to students and others who are learning the research process. </p>
<p>Students and other users can request a Librarian Prescription, on which Librarians will note keywords, key resources, and ideas for the research process.  In addition, students can use AskWA, a 24/7 chat reference service, to get reference help and information literacy instruction when the physical library is closed.  AskWA is accessible on the <a>Library home page</a>, through a little green Washington State icon on the lower left side of the page.</p>
