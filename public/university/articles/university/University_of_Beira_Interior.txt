<p>The <strong>University of Beira Interior</strong> (<strong>Universidade da Beira Interior</strong> or <strong>UBI</strong> for short) is a <a>public university</a> located in the city of <a>Covilh&#x00e3;</a>, <a>Portugal</a>. It was created in 1979, and has about 5,200 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all <a>academic degree</a>s in fields ranging from <a>medicine</a> and <a>biomedical sciences</a> to <a>aeronautical engineering</a> to <a>mathematics</a>. The university is named after the historical <a>Beira region</a>, meaning <em>Beira Interior</em> the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the <a>district of Viseu</a>, <a>district of Guarda</a> and the <a>district of Castelo Branco</a>, in today's <a>Centro region</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a <a>polytechnic</a>al institution in Covilh&#x00e3;, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilh&#x00e3; (<em>IPC - Instituto Polit&#x00e9;cnico da Covilh&#x00e3;</em>), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, <a>university institute</a>. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full <a>university</a> status and renamed University of Beira Interior (<em>Universidade da Beira Interior</em>).</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>For <a>teaching</a> and <a>research</a> purposes, UBI is organised into five <a>Faculties</a>. The Faculties are organised in Departments: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics; Physics; and Chemistry. </li>
  <li>The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the Departments of Textile Science and Technology; Paper Science and Technology; Electromechanical Engineering; Civil Engineering; and Aerospace Sciences. </li>
  <li>The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics; Department of Sociology; Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences. </li>
  <li>The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters </li>
  <li>The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences. </li>
</ul>
<p>All departments of the university grant the undergraduate <em>licenciado</em> degree (<a>licentiate's degree</a> or <a>bachelor's degree</a>), which requires a three-year full time study programme. UBI also awards postgraduate courses in the fields that are offered by its departments, granting the degrees of <em>mestre</em> (<a>master's degree</a>) and <em>doutor</em> (<a>Ph.D.</a>).</p>
<p>In order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development.</p>
<p>The <a>Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira</a> (Cova da Beira Hospital Center), with facilities in <a>Covilh&#x00e3;</a> and <a>Fund&#x00e3;o</a>, is the <a>teaching hospital</a> of the University of Beira Interior.</p>

<h2>University campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|The main library of the University of Beira Interior</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|P&#x00f3;lo I main buildings</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|The outside auditorium of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Beira Interior (P&#x00f3;lo III)</a> Over the years, the UBI had a remarkable evolution and nowadays it is a modern university full of well-equipped laboratories, ateliers, libraries, computer rooms, research centres, and offering a wide range of activities through the <a>students' union</a> (<em>Associa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o Acad&#x00e9;mica da Universidade da Beira Interior</em>) and university social services.</p>
<p>The university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilh&#x00e3; industrial roots. The city was an important textile centre, once known as the &quot;Portuguese Manchester&quot;. Over the last decades the city witnessed a restructuring of this industry. However, many factories were not able to meet the requirements of the global market and had to close down. Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, are started the 21st century serving the noble purpose of educating the Portuguese society.</p>
<p>Over 250,000 m2 of buildings are dedicated to academic activities and social services. The university campus is divided into several spaces, called <em>P&#x00f3;los</em>, which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution.</p>
<p>The synopsis below provides information about the <em>P&#x00f3;los</em> of UBI and its libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo I</strong> - The main building is a 17th century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices. New buildings near have been erected over the years to keep up the continuous growth of the UBI. Due to a diligent renovation work this set of buildings are considered historical, cultural and architectonical outstanding pieces of <a>industrial archaeology</a>. Among this sector the following units are located: the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, the Wool Museum, the Computer Centre, the Optics Centre, the S&#x00e3;o Martinho Chapel, the Main Library, the Bank, the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (Multimedia Centre) and the Centre For Heritage Studies and Recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo II</strong> - On a hill, less than 1&nbsp;km from P&#x00f3;lo I, and meeting the UBI need for constant expansion, an area was created where several central infrastructures, as the emblematic 16th century convent that nowadays houses the <a>Rectory</a>, the administration services and the international relations office. In the same area are also located the academic residences, Santo Antonio cafeteria, the sport halls, the social affairs centre and the centre of studies for regional development. The Department of Sports and Science is also located nearby.</li>
  <li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo III</strong> - This is where the Faculty of Health Sciences is located. It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the <a>Central Hospital</a> in a distance of 1&nbsp;km far from P&#x00f3;lo I.</li>
  <li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo IV</strong> - This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university.

<h2>Wool museum</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|220px|Wool museum entrance, to the right, which is delimited by two pedestrian bridges that connect two of the UBI's buildings</a> The UBI adapted the buildings of the former <em>Real F&#x00e1;brica de Panos</em> (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by <a>Marqu&#x00ea;s de Pombal</a> in 1764. This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the Regimento de Infantaria 21 (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the Batalh&#x00e3;o de Ca&#x00e7;adores 2 (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion).</p>
<p>In 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye-house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum's educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century.[<a>http://museu.ubi.pt/ind_ingles.html</a>]</p>
<p>Guided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday from 9:30h to midday and from 14:30h to 18h.</p>
