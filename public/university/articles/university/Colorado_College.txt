<p><strong>The Colorado College</strong> (familiarly known as <strong>CC</strong>) is a <a>private</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Colorado Springs</a>, <a>Colorado</a>. It was founded in 1874 by Thomas Nelson Haskell. The college enrolls approximately 2,000 undergraduates at its 90 acre (36&nbsp;<a>ha</a>) campus,  in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>Colorado College is known for its non-conventional &quot;block plan,&quot; which divides the year into eight <a>academic term</a>s called &quot;blocks&quot;; a single class is taken during each block.</p>
<p>Colorado College is affiliated with the <a>Associated Colleges of the Midwest</a>. Most sports teams are in the <a>NCAA</a> Division III, with the exception of Division I teams in men's hockey and women's soccer.  <a>Richard Celeste</a>, former Governor of <a>Ohio</a>, <a>ambassador</a> to <a>India</a>, and former Director of the <a>Peace Corps</a> serves as president.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Colorado College was founded in 1874 on land designated by U.S. Civil War veteran <a>General William Jackson Palmer</a>, the founder of the <a>Denver and Rio Grande Railroad</a> and of Colorado Springs. Founder Thomas Nelson Haskell, described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of <a>Oberlin College</a> in Ohio. In 2009, <a>Forbes</a> rated it 53rd of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>Colorado College has one of the highest retention rates of any college or university in the country at 96 percent. Colorado College also has one of the nation's lowest acceptance rates, at 24 percent, with a very high yield at 48 percent. The median ACT of the class of 2012 is a 31, and one-fourth of the class graduated in the top 1 percent of their high school class.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>In 2009, Colorado College developed a sustainability plan and implemented the &#x201c;aCClimate 14&#x201d; conservation campaign. The campus saved $100,000 in utility costs and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 378 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent during the campaign.  Other sustainability initiatives at CC include: a 25-kilowatt solar PV array, composting of kitchen and dining waste, and a singlestream recycling program.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center at Colorado College</a> Since the mid-1950s, new facilities include three large residence halls, Worner Campus Center, Tutt Library, Olin Hall of Science and the Barnes Science Center, Honnen Ice Rink, Boettcher Health Center, Schlessman Pool, Armstrong Hall of Humanities, Palmer Hall, El Pomar Sports Center, and Packard Hall of Music and Art. Bemis, Cossitt, Cutler, Montgomery, and Palmer Halls are some of the remaining turn-of-the-century structures on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>, along with the William I. Spencer Center.</p>
<p>The face of campus changed again at the beginning of the 21st century with construction of the Western Ridge Housing Complex, which offers apartment-style living for upper-division students and completion of the Russell T. <a>Tutt</a> Science Center. The east campus has been expanded, and is now home to the Greek Quad and several small residence halls known as &#x201c;theme houses.&#x201d;</p>
<h3>Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center</h3>
<p>Colorado College&#x2019;s <a>Edith Kinney Gaylord</a> Cornerstone Arts Center, completed in 2008 and located at the intersection of a performing arts corridor in Colorado Springs, was designed to foster creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration. It is home to the college&#x2019;s film, drama and dance departments and contains a large theater, several smaller performance spaces, a screening room, the I.D.E.A Space gallery, and classrooms, among other rooms. Architect <a>Antoine Predock</a> designed the building with input from professors and students.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  <a>right|200px|thumb|Map of CC</a> The school's sports teams are nicknamed <em>Tigers,</em> though in 1994 a student referendum to change the name to the <em>Cutthroats</em> (Trout) narrowly failed. Colorado College competes at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> level in all sports except men's <a>hockey</a>, in which it participates in the <a>NCAA Division I</a> <a>Western Collegiate Hockey Association</a>, and women's <a>soccer</a>, where it competes as an NCAA Division I team in <a>Conference USA</a>. CC dropped its intercollegiate athletic programs in football, softball, and women's water polo following the 2008-09 academic year.</p>
<p>The Colorado College men's ice hockey program competes well for such a small school. The Tigers won the NCAA Division I championship twice (1950, 1957), were runners up three times (1952, 1955, 1996) and have made the NCAA Tournament eighteen times, including eleven times since 1995.  In 1996, 1997, and 2005, CC played in the <a>Frozen Four</a>, finishing second in 1996. Fifty-five CC Tigers have been named All-Americans. NHL Hall of Fame coach Bob Johnson coached the Tigers from 1963 - 1966. Despite the relatively small size of the school, the hockey team is often ranked quite highly nationally, although it has been over 50 years since the Tigers last won an NCAA title. Their current coach is Scott Owens, who played for Colorado College and graduated from the school in 1979.</p>
<h2>Notable people</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Several CC alumni are engaged in political careers. Its graduates include <a>Lynne Cheney</a>, wife of former U.S. Vice President <a>Dick Cheney</a>, and their two daughters, as well as U.S. Secretary of the Interior <a>Ken Salazar</a>, and Representative <a>Diana DeGette</a>. </p>
<p>Other well-known government figures, such as Senior Advisor to President Obama <a>David Axelrod</a>, former CIA Director <a>James Woolsey</a> and White House Chief Economic Advisor <a>Martin Neil Baily</a>, have seen their children graduate from CC in recent years. The school is regarded to have a distinguished faculty, noted for outstanding teaching and a closeness to students in an environment where no class exceeds 25, and an end-of-block breakfast or dinner at a professor's home is a common gathering.  The college also owns a nearby cabin to convene classes, as well as a more expansive mountain campus known as the &quot;Baca,&quot; located in Crestone, Colorado.</p>
<p>While the focus at Colorado College is primarily on teaching, and its academics involve a high level of rigor and intensity on the block plan, a significant number of faculty are widely published and renowned in their fields. Professor Dennis Showalter, the 2005 recipient of the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Military History, is an expert on World War II, a Distinguished Visiting Professor at <a>West Point</a> and the <a>United States Air Force Academy</a>, Reviewer for the History Book Club, and author of <em>Tannenberg: Clash of Empires</em>, the 1992 winner of the <a>Paul Birdsall Prize</a> of the American Historical Association. In 2005, he published the first single volume dual military biography of Patton and Rommel, <em>Men of War</em>.</p>
<p>Notable music and arts representatives include Susan Grace, a  pianist with appearances at Carnegie Hall, <a>Stephen Scott</a>, a <a>neo-classical</a> composer, and <a>Ofer Ben-Amots</a>, an Israeli composer.</p>

<h2>KRCC</h2>
<p>Colorado College operates <a>National Public Radio</a> Member Station KRCC-FM. In 1944, <a>KRCC</a> began as a two-room public address system in the basement of Bemis Hall. Professor Woodson &quot;Chief&quot; Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Edmonds '51, and Margaret Merle-Smith '51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>Today, KRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico.  KRCC's main transmitter, atop <a>Cheyenne Mountain</a>, broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).</p>
<h2>Free speech concerns on campus</h2>
<p>The civil liberties organization <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> has named Colorado College on its Red Alert list for several years over its treatment of two students who distributed a satirical flyer which made fun of the college's Feminist and Gender Studies program.</p>
