<p>The <strong>Open University of Sri Lanka</strong> (OUSL) is a national university in <a>Sri Lanka</a>. It is unique within the Sri Lankan national university system for being the only university to offer programmes of study leading to certificate, diploma, degree, postgraduate diploma and postgraduate degree through the Distance Mode/ Learning. OUSL's academic programs enable students to combine theoretical study with meaningful real-world learning experiences.&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p>The OUSL Main Campus is located in Colombo in <a>Nawala</a>, <a>Nugegoda</a>.</p>
<h2>Establishment</h2>
<p>The concept of establishing the Open University of Sri Lanka was by Dr <a>Nissanka Wijeyeratne</a> the Cabinet Minister of Education &amp; Higher Education  at the time. &lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p>The University was set up by the Government of Sri Lanka under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, for the purpose of providing higher educational opportunities to working adults - providing them the road to success, surpassing age, vocation, gender, race, ethnicity and religion.&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p>The concept of Distance Education at the OUSL functions through a dynamic network of regional and study centres, with knowledge imparted through multiple media. Therefore students with work commitments are able to pursue studies since they interact with especially designed self-instructional materials where the materials function as a &#x201c;Tutor in Print&#x201d;. This method provides the distance learner with the best possible learning opportunity to enable a balancing of personal, work related and academic obligations.</p>
