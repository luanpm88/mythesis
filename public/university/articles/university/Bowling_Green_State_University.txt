<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Originally known as <strong>Bowling Green State Normal School</strong>, it was one of several institutions established in the <a>Progressive Era</a> to meet demands for training and professional development of <a>teacher</a>s. Classes began in 1914, enrolling 304 students primarily from <a>Ohio</a> and a few from <a>Michigan</a> and <a>New York</a> who were taught by the original faculty of 21. The school graduated 35 certified teachers in 1915, the same year that the campus&#x2019; first two buildings, University Hall and Williams Hall, opened their doors. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees were awarded. Setting the pace for teacher education in Ohio with four-year degree programs, Bowling Green State Normal School achieved the status of college in 1929 and expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the <em>College of Arts and Sciences</em>.</p>
<p>On October 28, 1927, the nickname &#x201c;Falcons&#x201d; was originated by the sports editor of the Daily Sentinel-Tribune. He thought the <a>Falcon</a> was fitting because it was indicative of a powerful bird that was small in stature, its coloring represented the Bowling Green school colors, and like the athlete, the falcon is a bird that goes through a long period of training before battle. At the time the school was still named Bowling Green State Normal College, Common nicknames, used by sports writers throughout the state, were &#x201c;B.G. Normals,&#x201d; &#x201c;Teachers,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;B.G. Pedagogues&quot;  </p>
<p>The addition of graduate programs and the College of Business Administration helped to raise the status of the institution from the college level when it was designated Bowling Green State University in 1935. With continued growth, the <a>Graduate School</a> was formed, and BGSU awarded its first doctoral degree in English in 1963.</p>
<h3>Recent History</h3>
<p>The 1970s represented a hallmark of progress with the addition of three new colleges. The <a>College of Health and Human Services</a> opened in 1973 to offer degree programs in a variety of health and community services. In 1975, the <em>School of Music</em> was elevated to the <a>College of Musical Arts</a> and the Graduate School to the <em>Graduate College</em>. Adding further evidence of the University&#x2019;s ability to address increasingly complex socioeconomic trends and offer expanding career opportunities, the School of Technology was given college status in 1985 and renamed the <a>College of Technology</a>. The founding tradition of teacher preparation is now maintained in the university's <em>College of Education and Human Development</em>.</p>
<p>Presidents of BGSU have included Homer B. Williams (1912&#x2013;1937), R.E. Offenhauer (1937&#x2013;1938), Frank J. Prout (1938&#x2013;1951), Ralph W. McDonald (1951&#x2013;1961), Ralph G.
