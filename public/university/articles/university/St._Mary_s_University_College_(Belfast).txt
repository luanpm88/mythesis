<p>  <strong>St Mary's University College</strong> () was established in 1985, but can directly trace its existence to 1900 and the foundation of <em>St Mary's Training College</em>, which focused mainly on the training of women as teachers. <em>St Joseph's Training College</em> was set up to train men and the amalgamation of the two colleges created the current institution in 1985. </p>
<p>The institution is located on the <a>Falls Road</a> in <a>Belfast</a>, and has approximately 60 staff and 1,300 students. The institution offers courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels for teacher training, especially for a <a>Catholic</a> ethos, including a PGCE for Irish Medium Education.  The college diversified its offerings several years ago and now offers a BA degree in Liberal Arts as well.</p>
<p>The university college's legacy institutions have been associated with Queen's University, Belfast, since 1949. Since 1968 Queen's degrees have been obtainable by the students of these two institutions.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Board of Governors is, ex-officio, the <a>Bishop</a> of the <a>Diocese of Down and Connor</a>. This is currently The Most Reverend Noel Treanor. The College is facing the potential of closure due to a number of factors including, inter alia, falling numbers of teachers required by schools.</p>
