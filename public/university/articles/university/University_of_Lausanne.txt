<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|220px|Palais de Rumine, one of the former buildings of the University of Lausanne</a> The Academy, forerunner of the UNIL, was founded in 1537. Its vocation at that time was to train ministers for the church. The university enjoyed a certain renown due to the fact that it was the only French language Protestant school of theology. </p>
<p>As the centuries passed, the number of faculties increased and diversified until, in 1890, the Academy received the name and status of a university. In 1909 Rodolphe Archibald Reiss founded the first school of <a>forensic science</a> in the world: the &quot;Institut de police scientifique&quot;. From 1970, the university moved progressively from the old centre of Lausanne, around the Cathedral and Ch&#x00e2;teau, to its present site at Dorigny. The end of the 20th century witnessed the beginnings of an ambitious project aiming at greater co-operation and development among the French-speaking universities of Lausanne, Geneva, and Neuch&#x00e2;tel, together with the EPFL. In 2003 two new faculties were founded concentrating on the life and human sciences: the Faculty of biology and medicine; and the Faculty of earth science and environment.</p>
