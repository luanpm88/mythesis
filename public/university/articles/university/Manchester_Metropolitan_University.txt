<p> <strong>Manchester Metropolitan University</strong> (<strong>MMU</strong>) is a university in <a>North West England</a>. Its headquarters and central campus is in the city of <a>Manchester</a>, but there are outlying facilities in the county of <a>Cheshire</a>.

It is a member of University Alliance and is classed as a new university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 1 January 1970 Manchester <a>Polytechnic</a> was formed by the amalgamation of Manchester College of Art and Design, Manchester College of Commerce (founded 1889) and <a>John Dalton</a> College of Technology. On 1 January 1977, the polytechnic merged with the Didsbury College of Education and Hollings College, and on 1 January 1983 with City of Manchester College of Higher Education. In 1987 the institution became a founding member of the <a>Northern Consortium</a>. Having previously been a local authority institution, the polytechnic became a corporate body on the 1st April 1989, as allowed by the terms of the <a>Education Reform Act 1988</a>.</p>
<p>It was granted university status as &quot;Manchester Metropolitan University&quot; by the <a>Privy Council</a> on 15 September 1992 under the provisions of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act, 1992</a>. The university absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education on 1 October 1992 and the Manchester School of Physiotherapy in 2003.</p>
