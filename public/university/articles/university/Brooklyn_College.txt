<p> <strong>Brooklyn College</strong> is a senior college of the <a>City University of New York</a>, located in <a>Brooklyn, New York</a>.</p>
<p>Established in 1930 by the <a>New York City</a> Board of Higher Education, the College had its beginnings as the Downtown Brooklyn branches of <a>Hunter College</a> (then a <a>women's college</a>) and the <a>City College of New York</a> (then a <a>men's college</a>).  With the merger of these branches, Brooklyn College became the first public coeducational <a>liberal arts college</a> in New York City.  The  campus is known for its great beauty.</p>
<p>The College ranked in the top 10 nationally for the second consecutive year in <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em>&#x2019;s 2006 guidebook, <em>America&#x2019;s Best Value Colleges</em>.</p>
<h2>Campus history</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|East Quad: Boylan Hall, LaGuardia Hall Library and Ingersoll Hall</a> In 1932, the <a>architect</a> Randolph Evans drafted a plan for the college's campus on a large plot of land his employer owned in the <a>Midwood</a> section of Brooklyn. He sketched out a <a>Georgian</a>-style campus facing a central <a>quadrangle</a>, and anchored by a library building with a tall tower.  Evans presented the sketches to the president of the college at the time, Dr. William A. Boylan.  Boylan was pleased with the plans, and the lot of land was purchased for $1.6 million.  Construction of the new campus began in 1935, with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by then <a>Mayor</a> <a>Fiorello La Guardia</a> and Brooklyn <a>Borough President</a> Raymond Ingersoll.  In 1936, then-President of the <a>United States</a> <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> went to Brooklyn College to lay the <a>cornerstone</a> of the Brooklyn College <a>Gym</a>nasium.  President Boylan, Borough President Ingersoll, and President Roosevelt all had buildings on Brooklyn College's campus named after them.  The campus located in <a>Midwood</a> became the only Brooklyn College campus after the school's <a>Downtown Brooklyn</a> campus was shut down during the 1975 budget emergency.</p>
<h3>Modern campus history</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|BC in Winter|left</a> Brooklyn College's campus today looks much as it did when it was originally constructed, but with extensions of Ingersoll Hall and <a>Roosevelt Hall</a>.  The campus also serves as home to the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts complex and its four theaters, including the <a>George Gershwin</a>. </p>
<p>The most recent construction to take place was the demolition of the Plaza Building, due to its inefficient use of space, poor ventilation, and significant maintenance cost.  To replace the Plaza Building, the college has constructed a new West Quad, designed by the notable <a>Uruguayan</a> architect <a>Rafael Vi&#x00f1;oly</a>.  The new grounds contain a newly landscaped <a>quadrangle</a> with grassy areas and trees.  Also, new <a>fa&#x00e7;ade</a>s are being constructed on the Roosevelt and James Hall buildings where they once connected with the Plaza Building.  In addition to these changes, a new West Quad building has been completed. It contains classroom space, offices, and the Department of <a>Physical Education</a> and Exercise Science.  The building also has new gymnasiums, and a swimming pool. The 2009-10 <a>CUNYAC</a> championship men's basketball team now plays its home games in the new West Quad Building. </p>
<p>This follows a major library renovation that saw the library moved to a temporary home while construction took place. The Brooklyn College library is now located in its original location in a completely renovated and expanded LaGuardia Hall. The Leonard and Claire Tow Performing Arts Center is scheduled to be built on the site of Gershwin Hall. Noted as one of the most beautiful in the United States, the campus has been shown on numerous movies and television shows.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the Brooklyn College faculty hold the highest degree in their field.  Among them are <a>Fulbright</a> and <a>Guggenheim</a> fellows, an <a>American Book Award</a> winner, a <a>National Book Award</a> finalist, an <a>Obie Award</a>-winning playwright, three <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning authors, and award-winning scientists and musicians.</p>
<p>The College ranks 1st nationally in the number of its undergraduates who have gone on to earn <a>Ph.D.</a> degrees.</p>
<h2>Divisions</h2>
<p>Brooklyn College is made up of three academic divisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</li>
  <li>School of <a>General Studies</a></li>
  <li>Division of <a>Graduate Studies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the <a>Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College</a> offers undergraduate and graduate work in performance, musicology, composition, and music education.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate curriculum</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1981, the college instituted a group of classes that all undergraduates were required to take, called &quot;Core Studies&quot;.  The classes were: Classical Origins of Western Culture; Introduction to Art; Introduction to Music; People, Power, and Politics; The Shaping of the Modern World; Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning and Computer Programming; Landmarks of Literature; Chemistry; Physics; Biology; Geology; Studies in African, Asian, and Latin American Cultures; and Knowledge, Existence and Values.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Core Curriculum was revamped, and the 13 required courses were replaced with 15 courses in 3 disciplines, from which students were required to take 11.</p>
<h2>Division of Graduate Studies</h2>
<p>The Division of Graduate Studies at Brooklyn College was established in 1935 and offers more than seventy programs in the arts, education, humanities, sciences, and computer and social sciences.</p>
<p>Graduate programs are offered in Africana Studies, Anthropology and Archaeology, Art, Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Information Science, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Economics, Education, English, Health and Nutrition Sciences, History, Judaic Studies, Mathematics, Modern Languages and Literatures, Music, Physical Education and Exercise Science, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Puerto Rican and Latino Studies, Sociology, Speech Communication Arts and Sciences, Television and Radio as well as Theater.</p>
<h2>B.A.-M.D. program</h2>
<p>The Brooklyn College <a>B.A.</a>-<a>M.D.</a> program is an 8-year program affiliated with <a>SUNY Downstate Medical Center</a>. The Program follows a rigorous selection process, with a maximum of 15 students selected every year. Each student selected to the program receives a Brooklyn College Presidential Scholarship.   B.A.-M.D. students must engage in <a>community service</a> for three years, beginning in their lower sophomore semester.  During one summer of their undergraduate studies, students are required to volunteer in a clinical setting where they are involved in direct <a>patient care</a>.  B.A.-M.D. students are encouraged to major in the <a>humanities</a> or <a>social sciences</a>.  A student who majors in a science must choose a minor in the humanities or social sciences.  All students meet the pre-med science requirements by taking <a>cell</a> and <a>molecular biology</a>, <a>botany</a>, <a>physiology</a>, general <a>chemistry</a>, <a>organic chemistry</a>, and general <a>physics</a>.  B.A.-M.D. students must maintain at Brooklyn College an overall <a>grade point average</a> of 3.5, and a pre-med science GPA of 3.5.</p>
<h2>The Scholars Program</h2>
<p>The Scholars Program was established in 1960 with support from the <a>Ford Foundation</a>.  It was the first honors program in the City University of New York, and one of the earliest at any American college or university.  The program received national recognition, became a model for honors programs elsewhere, and was the foundation of the Brooklyn College Honors Academy, which now includes nine federated programs.  </p>
<p>Students in the program are distinguished by their strong writing ability. Applicants must score at least 680 on their SAT II Writing, and maintain a GPA over 3.50.  Graduates of the Scholars Program enter such fields as medicine, law, speech therapy, public health, television, film producing and directing, and biochemistry.  They are admitted to graduate programs at such schools as Harvard Law School, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Yale, Berkeley, New York University, and London School of Economics and Political Science. Many are elected to membership in <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, and have received awards, including Brooklyn College&#x2019;s Tow Travel Fellowship and Furman Travel Fellowship for undergraduate international study and research, and the nationally competitive Beinecke Fellowship and Mellon Humanities Fellowship for graduate study.  Limited to 15-20 new students per year, the Program offers a community much like a small residential college.</p>
<h2>Coordinated Engineering Program</h2>
<p>The Coordinated Honors Engineering Program offers a course of study equivalent to the first two years at any engineering school. Students who maintain the required academic level are guaranteed transfer to one of the three coordinating schools&#x2014;Polytechnic University, City College of New York School of Engineering, and the College of Staten Island Engineering Science Program&#x2014;to complete their bachelor&#x2019;s degree in engineering. Coordinating Engineering students have also transferred to SUNY Stony Brook, University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Cooper Union, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students admitted as incoming First-Year receive a Brooklyn College Foundation Presidential Scholarship that provides full tuition for their two years of full-time undergraduate study in the Coordinated Engineering Program. As members of the Honors Academy, Engineering Honors students take advantage of individual advising, faculty consultation, and early registration. In the Commons they find study facilities, computer access, academic, scholarship, internship, and career opportunities, and, above all, intellectual stimulation among other talented students like themselves. Students applying to the Engineering Honors Program will also be considered for the Scholars Program.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>Controversy erupted during the 2010 school year, when some professors issued protests, picked up by conservatives, against the fact that, according to one alumni who decided to <a>disinherit</a> his <a>alma mater</a>, &quot;all incoming freshmen and transfer students are given a copy of a book to read, and no other, to create their '<a>common experience</a>.' &#x2026; <a>The author</a> is characterized by some as being a radical pro-<a>Palestinian</a> professor.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x2026; One professor&#x2019;s unpublished letter [of protest, asking for a <a>balanced</a> presentation,] to <a>the college president</a> said: 'Anyone who has taught at a university during the past quarter-century and more knows that the <a>slogan</a> of &quot;<a>diversity</a>&quot; generally alludes to its opposite (i.e., imposed <a>uniformity</a> of thought camouflaged by <a>diversity</a> of physical appearance) and also foretells <a>mischief</a>.'&quot;</p>
<h2>Tanger Hillel</h2>
<p>The Tanger Hillel @ Brooklyn College is part of the <a>Hillel Foundation</a> organization in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>Built in 1959, the Tanger building was designed by Percival Goodman, a leading architect of American synagogues. It is located at the junction of Campus Road and Hillel Place, across from the Whitman Auditorium of Brooklyn College, at the center of Brooklyn. Brooklyn College currently houses the largest Hillel facility among CUNY campuses, featuring a host of recreational and social amenities.</p>
