<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Marshall University</strong> is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Huntington, West Virginia</a> founded in 1837, and named after <a>John Marshall</a>, the fourth <a>Chief Justice of the United States</a>. </p>
<p>The university is composed of eight colleges and schools: the College of Liberal Arts (COLA), the College of Fine Arts (COFA), the College of Education and Human Services (COEHS), the College of Information Technology and Engineering (CITE), the Elizabeth McDowell Lewis College of Business (LCOB), the College of Science (COS), the College of Health Professions (COHP), and the W. Page Pitt School of Journalism and Mass Communications (SOJMC). The University is also home to the <a>Joan C. Edwards</a> School of Medicine, a regional center for cancer research which has a national reputation for its programs in rural health care delivery. The prominent <a>forensic science graduate program</a> is one of only three post-graduate-level academic programs in the United States accredited by the <a>American Academy of Forensic Sciences</a> and considered by many to be the best Forensic Science program in the United States. The Elizabeth McDowell Lewis College of Business has achieved AACSB accreditation.</p>
<p>Marshall University also operates the Robert C. Byrd Institute, with operations on both the Huntington and South Charleston campuses, as well as in <a>Fairmont, West Virginia</a>, and <a>Rocket Center, West Virginia</a>. The goal of the Institute is the transfer of technology from the academic departments to private industry to support job development in the region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marshall University was founded in 1837 as a private <a>subscription school</a> by residents of Guyandotte and the surrounding area.  The landmark <a>Old Main</a>, which now serves as the primary administrative building for the university, was built on land known as Maple Grove, at the time the home of the Mount Hebron Church in what was then the <a>state</a> of <a>Virginia</a>. <a>John Laidley</a>, a local <a>attorney</a>, hosted the meeting which led to the founding of Marshall Academy, which was named after Laidley's friend, the eminent <a>John Marshall</a> In 1858, the <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> changed the name to Marshall College. but this change still did not reflect its status as a true college.  The <a>Civil War</a> closed the often financially-challenged school for much of the 1860s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On June 20, 1863, <a>Cabell County, Virginia</a>, was one of the <a>50 counties</a> separated from Virginia at the height of the <a>American Civil War</a> to form the State of <a>West Virginia</a>, and the college fell within the new state of. In 1867, the <a>West Virginia Legislature</a> resurrected the institution as a teacher training facility and renamed it State Normal School of Marshall College.  This began the history of the college as a state supported institution at the collegiate level.</p>
<h3>20th century</h3>
<p>With the exception of the Old Main building, expansion of the facilities and the college itself did not begin until 1907, when the Board of Regents of <a>West Virginia</a> changed the title of the head from &quot;principal&quot; to &quot;president&quot; and allowed the creation of new college-level departments. Numerous structures, such as Northcott Hall and the James E. Morrow Library were extensively flooded. Much of Huntington was also heavily damaged, and as a result, a <a>floodwall</a> was constructed around much of the town to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<p>The West Virginia <a>Board of Education</a> authorized Marshall College in 1938 to offer the master's degree in six programs: <a>chemistry</a>, <a>education</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>political science</a>, <a>psychology</a>, and <a>sociology</a>, as the institution underwent another expansion. In that year the school was accredited as a &quot;university level institution&quot;; however, the renaming of the school would remain a contentious political issue for decades to come.  Further expansion accelerated after World War II. </p>
<p>In 1960, <a>John F. Kennedy</a> spoke at the college during his cross-country campaign for the presidency.</p>
<p>On March 1, 1961, Marshall College became Marshall University as the West Virginia Legislature approved university status for the institution and the legislation was signed by Governor W. W. Barron. The student newspaper, The Parthenon, prepared two front pages for the day, depending on the outcome of the legislature's vote.  Also in 1961, <a>WMUL-FM</a> began operations as the first public radio station in West Virginia. The station, which began in the Science Building at 10 <a>watt</a>s of power, now broadcasts from the Communications Building with 1,150 watts.</p>
<p>In 1969, the university's athletic program, facing a number of scandals, fired both its <a>football</a> and basketball coaches and was suspended from the <a>Mid-American Conference</a> and from the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>. The university rebuilt its athletic program back to respectability, and in 1977, the university joined the <a>Southern Conference</a>.</p>
<h4>1970 Football team airplane crash</h4>
<p><a>225px|thumb|left|Inscription at the burial site for the unidentified victims of the 1970 plane crash.</a> </p>
<p>On the evening of November 14, 1970, the <a>Thundering Herd</a> <a>football</a> team, along with coaches and fans, was returning home to Huntington from <a>Kinston</a>, North Carolina.  The team had just lost a game 17&#x2013;14 against the <a>East Carolina University</a> <a>Pirates</a> at <a>Ficklen Stadium</a> in <a>Greenville, North Carolina</a>.  The chartered <a>Southern Airways Flight 932</a> crashed on approach to the <a>Tri-State Airport</a> after clipping trees just west of the runway and impacting nose-first into a hollow.  All seventy-five people on board were killed, including 37 players and 5 coaches.  13 players who were not on the plane survived (Source:  <a>http://users.marshall.edu/~rossett1/pages/1970/crash.html</a>), along with the members of the freshman football team, who were not eligible to play varsity under the rules of that time and were not on the plane.</p>
<p>The team was rebuilt with <a>Jack Lengyel</a> as the new head coach.  The leaders of the &quot;Young Thundering Herd&quot; (to which the team officially changed its name for the 1971 season) were the few players who didn't make the trip due to injury or disciplinary action. There were 15 sophomores on the team from the previous year's freshman team, and the bulk of the team was composed of freshmen players who were allowed to play on the varsity squad due to the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>, <a>college football's</a> governing body, waiving a rule prohibiting it.  Three years later, it would waive the rule for all schools.  Rounding out the squad were players from other Marshall sports programs.  They would win only two games that year.  Their first win was an emotional 15&#x2013;13 victory against <a>Xavier University</a> in the home opener.  Their second win, in their homecoming game, was against a better, ranked team: the <a>Bowling Green State University</a> <a>Falcons</a>.</p>
<p>The plaza at the center of the school has a fountain dedicated to the seventy-five victims.  The water does not flow from November 14 until the first day of spring football practice the following year. The tragedy and its aftermath were the subject of several documentaries, including the award-winning <em><a>Marshall University: Ashes to Glory</a></em>.  The tragedy and the rebuilding efforts were dramatized in the 2006 <a>Warner Brothers</a> feature, <em><a>We Are Marshall</a></em> which opened in <a>Huntington</a> a week before its national release date. Many scenes in the movie were filmed on the campus and throughout Huntington.</p>
<h4>From 1970</h4>
<p>In 1971 the <a>Williamson</a> and <a>Logan</a> campuses of Marshall University were combined by the West Virginia Legislature to form <a>Southern West Virginia Community College</a> (now Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College). </p>
<p>In 1977 the university founded its School of Medicine, the first professional school and the first doctoral program.  Over the next 20 years the school would add doctoral programs in many fields. Twenty years later, in 1997, the <a>West Virginia Graduate College</a> became the graduate college of Marshall University. Its campus is located in <a>South Charleston, West Virginia</a>. In 1998, the John Deaver Drinko Library opened on campus. The center includes a 24-hour study center and a coffee shop, and has both wired and wireless networking throughout the building. John Deaver Drinko graduated from the university in 1942.</p>
<p>In 1997, Marshall merged with the University of West Virginia College of Graduate Studies (COGS), with the latter being renamed <em>Marshall University Graduate College</em>..  In 2010 the university was authorized to begin offering undergraduate classes in South Charleston and renamed the facility <a>Marshall University - South Charleston Campus</a>.</p>
<p>Marshall's enrollment was 16,500 in 2004. In addition to the main campus in Huntington and the branch campus in <a>South Charleston, West Virginia</a>, the school maintains undergraduate centers in <a>Gilbert</a>, <a>Point Pleasant</a>, and <a>Hurricane, West Virginia</a>. In 1989, Marshall was governed by the <a>University of West Virginia</a> <a>Board of Trustees</a>, but this ended in 2000.</p>
<p>In July 2005, Dr. <a>Stephen J. Kopp</a> took over as Marshall University's president and Dr. Gayle Ormiston serves as the Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs. The eight college deans are Dr. David J. Pittenger (COLA), Mr. Don Van Horn (COFA), Dr. Robert Bookwalter (Interim) (COEHS), Betsy Dulin, JD (CITE), Dr. Chong Kim (LCOB), Dr. Chuck Somerville (COS), Dr. Michael Prewitt (COHP), and Dr. Corley Dennison (SOJMC). Dr. Charles McKown is the Dean of the School of Medicine.</p>
<h3>21st century</h3>

<p>Several new facilities have been recently completed all around the Huntington campus.  These buildings include two new first-year student residence halls, a health and recreation center, an engineering lab facility, softball field, and an artificial turf practice field that is open to the public.  The Marshall University Foundation Hall, home of the Erickson Alumni Center, is the most recent building to be completed on campus.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The scholarship and achievements of Marshall's faculty are also bringing more attention to the University. Dr. <a>Jackie Agesa</a> and Dr. <a>Richard Agesa</a> are among the top 20 <a>black</a> economists in the nation. Dr. <a>Jean Edward Smith</a>, known for his works <em>Grant</em> and <em>John Marshall: Definer of a Nation,</em> was a finalist for the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> in biography. The Higher Education for <a>Learning Problems</a> (H.E.L.P.) program founded by Dr. Barbara Guyer assists students with learning disabilities and related disorders complete their college education. </p>
<p>Marshall offers two prestigious and academically rigorous scholarship programs: the <a>John Marshall Scholars</a> and the <a>Society of Yeager Scholars</a> program.</p>
<p>The University maintains major involvement in the arts for the cultural benefit of the surrounding <a>Appalachian</a> region.  The Joan C. Edwards Performing Arts center is a state-of-the-art, 530-seat facility for studies in the fields of music, art, and theatre. The Jomie Jazz Center is a $2.6 million facility that houses the University's study program in <a>jazz</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2007, the Marshall's Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine was ranked fifth in the nation in producing family physicians, according to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.</p>
<p>In 2005, Marshall alum and <em><a>Chicago Tribune</a></em> reporter <a>Julia Keller</a> won the <a>Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing</a>. <a>CNN</a> <a>White House</a> correspondent <a>Joe Johns</a> also is a Marshall alum.</p>
<p>In 2009, Marshall's Forensic Science Graduate Program ranked #1 in the nation based upon scores on the Forensic Science Assessment Test (FSAT), which is a qualifying test offered by the American Board of Criminalistics.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>left|thumb|125px|Marshall University's official athletics logo, featuring Marco the buffalo</a> </p>
<p>Marshall's sports teams are known as the <em>Thundering Herd</em>. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> (<a>I-A</a> for <a>football</a>) as a member of <a>Conference USA</a>. The name Thundering Herd came from a Zane Gray novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same two years later. Marshall teams were originally known as the Indians, and the green-white colors came in 1903, replacing black and blue. Herald-Dispatch sports editor Carl &quot;Duke&quot; Ridgley tagged the team with the Thundering Herd name, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years, including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, Judges and others. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department's fund-raising wing.</p>
<p><a>225px|thumb|right|Marshall University vs. Cincinnati Bearcats 2008 (before game)</a></p>
<p>From 1964 to 1983, Marshall's football program suffered a dismal streak of losing seasons and was suspended by the Mid-American Conference in 1969 for 144 alleged recruiting violations in 1968&#x2013;69 in football and basketball. While the NCAA issued a one-year probation, the MAC would not take the program back as late as 1972. This was exacerbated by the <a>1970 plane crash</a> that killed nearly all of the team's coaches and players. Marshall had the worst record of any major college playing football in the 1970s, winning only 23 games and losing 83 over that ten-year period. Marshall joined the Southern Conference for all sports in 1977, but football was 0&#x2013;26&#x2013;1 in the first five years. MU's only non-loss came on a 59-yard field goal with no time left by freshman Barry Childers at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C., for a 13&#x2013;13 tie. In 1981, Marshall won its first SC game by beating Appalachian State in Boone, N.C., 17&#x2013;14, and the celebration included a 30-mile police escort and a crowd estimated at 3,000 met the team when they unloaded at Gullickson Hall on the MU campus.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1984, Marshall football experienced a remarkable turnaround as Stan Parrish's first team nailed down a 6&#x2013;5 mark with a 31&#x2013;28 win at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tenn., inside the Memorial Center or &quot;Mini-Dome,&quot; the Buccaneers 12,000-seat indoor football facility. The Thundering Herd posted 21 straight winning seasons, winning the SC in 1988, 1994 and 1996, before going 4&#x2013;7 in 2005 under first-year head coach Mark Snyder, a former Herd All-American defensive back and native of nearby South Point, Ohio, who played for the Herd in 1987 after leading the Ironton (Ohio) Tigers to the state championship game as a quarterback. </p>

<p>During the 1990s, Marshall posted the most wins of any NCAA Division I football program in America, winning 114 games and losing just 25. The Thundering Herd won Division I-AA national championships in 1992 and 1996 before moving to I-A in 1997, and set a Division I, FCS (formerly I-AA, now the Football Championship Subdivision of Division I athletics) record by advancing to the &quot;Final Four&quot; of the I-AA Tournament for six consecutive seasons. </p>
<p>Marshall has gone to nine bowl games in I-A, posting a 6&#x2013;3 record, and the Herd finished No. 10 in the nation in 1999 in both the Associated Press poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll when MU was 13&#x2013;0. They knocked off No. 25-ranked BYU in the 1999 Motor City Bowl in Pontiac, Michigan, 21&#x2013;3 to complete the second perfect season in four years (15&#x2013;0 for 1996's I-AA Championship team, rated the best-ever in I-AA with stars like Randy Moss, Erik Kresser, Doug Chapman, Erik Thomas, Tim Martin, <a>Billy Lyon</a>, B.J. Cohen, Larry McCloud, Melvin Cunningham, William Hosaflook and many others).</p>
<p>Under head coach and Marshall alum Bobby Pruett, the Thundering Herd made a triumphant return to Division I-A, returning to the Mid-American Conference. Led by quarterback <a>Chad Pennington</a> and All-American wide receiver <a>Randy Moss</a>, Marshall won the MAC championship in 1997. In 1999, the Herd completed an undefeated season resulting in an <a>Associated Press</a> Top 10 ranking. By 2000, with quarterback <a>Byron Leftwich</a>, Marshall extended its string of consecutive MAC titles to four, over Toledo (1997 &amp; 1998) and Western Michigan (1999 &amp; 2000). The Herd lost in the MAC championship game in 2001, but reclaimed the conference title in 2002. At the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, Marshall rallied from a 8&#x2013;38 lead by East Carolina behind five second half touchdowns from Leftwich, to win 64&#x2013;61 in double overtime, the highest scoring bowl game in NCAA history. Marshall would defeat Louisville in the 2002 GMAC Bowl for its fourth win over a Conference USA program in five bowls (UL-1998 Motor City Bowl; Cincinnati-2000 MCB; ECU-2001 GMAC Bowl; UL-2002 GMAC Bowl). Marshall would lost to C-USA member Cincinnati in the 2004 PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl in Bob Pruett's final season. Later that year, Marshall would join Conference USA while Louisville and Cincinnati, along with DePaul, Marquette and South Florida jumped to the Big East from C-USA and UNC-Charlotte and St. Louis left C-USA to join the Atlantic 10. Joining MU in C-USA in 2005 was UCF, who played in the MAC for football and Atlantic Sun for other sports, and Tulsa, Rice, UTEP and SMU also joined the league with Southern Miss, Tulane, Houston, UAB, Memphis and East Carolina, who remained members after the other schools left.</p>
<p>[[Image:TheJoan.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Joan C. Edwards Stadium (Marshall University)|Joan C. Edwards Stadium]]]] [[Image:CamHendersonCenter.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The [[Cam Henderson Center]]]]</p>
<p>In 2003, Marshall renamed its football stadium with a capacity of 38,016, <a>Joan C. Edwards Stadium</a>, honoring a major donor to the university and its athletic program. The facility became the first football stadium in Division I-A to be named after a woman. Also in 2003, Marshall University, under much scrutiny, disbanded its men's track &amp; field program, expressing financial concerns with the school's 2005 move from MAC to <a>Conference USA</a>. Since that time it has been demonstrated that men's track paid for itself due to the students paying for the majority of their schooling.</p>
<p>Despite past conference titles and three appearances in the NCAA Tournament, men's basketball at the University has been in a state of relative mediocrity since advancing to the NIT in 1988. Marshall finished as runner-up in its final Southern Conference tournament in 1997, losing on a last second shot by UT-Chattanooga, and made one trip to the Mid-American Conference semi-finals in 2000 before falling to Miami, Ohio. </p>
<p>Both men's and women's basketball are played at the 9,600-seat <a>Cam Henderson Center</a>, named for the innovative coach who guided the school's basketball team from 1935 to 1955 and football from 1935&#x2013;49. Henderson is the coach who developed the fast break, the zone defense and even the &quot;King Drill&quot; warm-up made famous by the Harlem Globetrotters. Henderson won 358 games against just 158 losses as basketball coach, and captured the NAIB (today's NAIA) National Championship with a school-record 32&#x2013;5 mark in 1946&#x2013;47 in the tournament that is still held in Kansas City. In football, he coached the Herd to the Buckeye Conference title in 1937 and then to the second-ever Tangerine Bowl on Jan. 1, 1948, falling to Catawba College 7&#x2013;0. Henderson won 68 games as football coach. </p>
<p>Donnie Jones took over the men's basketball program in 2007&#x2013;08, coming to MU from back-to-back titles in the NCAA Tournament with Billy Donovan at Florida. Donovan had been MU's head coach 1994&#x2013;96, and Jones was an assistant at both MU and UF before taking the Marshall job in '07. Jones got Marshall to a winning record for the first time since 2001 with a 16&#x2013;14 mark in his first season. Jones will field his 2008&#x2013;09 team with transfers from Florida, Purdue and Georgetown mixed in with seniors Markel Humphrey and Darryl Merthie; junior Tyler Wilkerson; sophomore Tirrell Baines; and freshmen Marcus Goode (a prop in '07-08), Damier Pitt, Shaquille Johnson, Nigel Spikes and Kore White, the Herd figures to continue the improvement that drove its attendance up over 5,000 per game, the 14th-best increase in the nation. Chadwick's women's team will return four starters and hope to avoid injuries in pursuit of a C-USA title after finishing 17&#x2013;16. Casey Baker was on the All-Conference USA Defensive team and Tynikki Crook was named to the All-Tournament team.</p>
<p>Other sports at the school include men's and women's <a>cross country</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>swimming</a> &amp; <a>diving</a>, tennis, and <a>track &amp; field</a>; men's baseball; and teams for both genders in <a>golf</a>, and <a>soccer</a>. Marshall also fields club teams, not affiliated with the MU Athletic Department, in <a>rugby union</a> for both women and men, and a men's <a>lacrosse</a> team. </p>
<p>The Thundering Herd women's <a>volleyball</a> team won the 2005 <a>Conference USA</a> regular season and tournament championships. In 2007, they again won the C-USA Regular Season title and featured four-time All-American Kelly-Anne Billingy, the three-time C-USA Player of the Year. Head coach Mitch Jacobs will set the all-time winning record for a volleyball coach at Marshall in the 2008 season. He also coached the team to the MAC Regular Season title in 2005.</p>
<p><a>275px|thumb|left|Joan C. Edwards Stadium at dusk.</a></p>
<p>Marshall baseball, who won the Southern Conference in 1978 and 1981 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament in 1973 and 1978, finished as runner-up in the C-USA Baseball Tournament, falling in the finals to Houston, 3&#x2013;2, but winning a MU record 30 games without a home field to use in Huntington for the entire season (Marshall has played C-USA games at Charleston's Appalachian Power Park since joining the league in 2006). For the first time since 1994, MU had players drafted in the June 5&#x2013;6 Major League Draft with a school-record three being selected, plus one recruit. Steve Blevins, who tied the single-season wins mark with a 9&#x2013;3 mark, signed with the Minnesota Twins on June 11, while Nate Lape was drafted by the Colorado Rockies and Tommy Johnson by the Seattle Mariners. Lape and second baseman Adam Yeager are playing this summer in the Cape Cod League, the premier wooden bat summer college baseball league, for the Brewster Whitecaps. </p>
<p>Softball won 26 games behind four-time All-American Rachel Folden, who re-wrote the Marshall softball record books in home runs and RBI, and was again the C-USA Player of the Year. Folden joined her coach, Shonda Stanton, and two former Marshall players, Jessica and Amanda Williams, in the National Fast-Pitch League this summer. Marshall also sent three track athletes (Rachel Blankenship, Andrea Jackson and Teniqua Sutton), one diver (Siobhan Schuurman) and two tennis players (Kellie Schmitt and Karolina Soor) to the NCAA Regionals and Championships. Schmitt won for the first time in Marshall history in singles, Blakenship finished 15th in the shot, with her second-best throw of the year and Jackson was 20th in the triple jump.</p>
<p>Marshall's biggest rivalries out of conference are with <a>Ohio University</a>, <a>Miami University</a> and <a>West Virginia University</a>, while <a>East Carolina University</a> and <a>University of Central Florida</a> have been the biggest rivals in Conference USA so far. <a>Tulane University</a> and the Herd baseball team now seem to be bitter rivals as MU was 3&#x2013;1&#x2013;1 against the Green Wave in 2008, winning its first game ever back in April in New Orleans. Marshall returned to the &quot;Big Easy&quot; in May and knocked Tulane out of the C-USA Tournament on the Green Wave home field, Turchin Stadium, in the C-USA Tournament, 10&#x2013;5 and 8&#x2013;7. Yeager stole a league-record five bases against TU in the opening win, while Jeff Rowley scored the winning run in game two on a wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
