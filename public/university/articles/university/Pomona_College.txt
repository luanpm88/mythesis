<p>  <strong>Pomona College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>residential</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Claremont, California</a>. It has ranked in the top ten of liberal arts colleges nationally according to the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> rankings since their inception and is currently ranked sixth. In 2009, <em><a>Kiplinger</a></em> ranked Pomona first among the liberal arts colleges in America. Founded in 1887  in <a>Pomona, California</a>, by a group of <a>Congregationalists</a>, the college moved to Claremont in 1889 to the site of a donated hotel, retaining its name.  The school enrolls 1,548 students. Beginning in 1925, the Claremont Colleges, which have grown to include five total undergraduate and two graduate institutions, have provided Pomona's student body with the resources of a larger <a>university</a> while preserving the closeness of a small college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:President Roosevelt speaks at Pomona College, 1903.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] addresses a large crowd outside of Pearsons Hall on the campus of Pomona College in Claremont.]] Pomona College was established as a coeducational institution on October 14, 1887.  The group wanted to create a college in the same mold as small New England institutions.  The College was originally formed in <a>Pomona</a>; classes first began in a rented house on September 12, 1888.  The next year, the school was moved to Claremont, at the site of an unfinished hotel.  The project had been deferred following the suicide of Gwendolyn Rose, who died in the basement during construction.  This building would eventually become Sumner Hall, current location of the Admissions and the Office of Campus Life.  The name &#x2013; Pomona College &#x2013; remained after the relocation.  The College&#x2019;s first graduating class consisted of ten members in 1894.  The <a>board of trustees</a> was originally composed of graduates of <a>Williams</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Colby</a> and <a>Yale</a>, among others, to help create &quot;a college of the <a>New England</a> type.&quot;  By 1997, the consortium reached its present membership of 5 undergraduate and 2 graduate institutions.</p>
<p>Pomona's strength has been its quality of education and preparation for graduate and professional schools as well as postgraduate fellowships. In 2007, 24 members of the Class of 2007 were awarded <a>Fulbright Scholarships</a> along with four other alumni, thus making Pomona tied with <a>Brown University</a> for third in the nation and first among liberal arts colleges. Pomona was also named as one of the New Ivies by <em><a>Newsweek</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Pomona&#x2019;s campus is located in Claremont, California, covering an area of .  It includes 59 buildings, including 12 <a>residence halls</a>.  He had the foresight to purchase the empty land around the College while it was still available, securing the College&#x2019;s future and allowing for expansion for years to come.</p>
<p>Currently, First Street borders the campus on the south, Mills and Amherst Avenues to the east, Eighth Street on the north, and Harvard Avenue on the west. <a>Claremont Graduate University</a>, <a>Scripps College</a> and <a>Claremont McKenna College</a> are adjacent to Pomona&#x2019;s north, from west to east respectively.  Pomona is divided into North Campus and South Campus, casually divided by Sixth Street, with a few exceptions.  Many of the earlier buildings were constructed in the <a>Spanish Renaissance Revival</a> and <a>Mission Styles</a>, usually only one or two stories in height.  Bridges Hall of Music, designed by Pasadena architect <a>Myron Hunt</a>, is an example of these styles combined.  Also of note is Sumner Hall, Pomona&#x2019;s first building, Bridges Auditorium (&#x201c;Big Bridges&#x201d;) &#x2014;used for concerts and speakers with a capacity of 2,500&#x2014;Bridges Hall of Music (&#x201c;Little Bridges&#x201d;), a concert hall built in 1915  with seating for 600, and Carnegie Building, which houses the <a>Politics</a> and <a>Economics</a> departments.  It was originally built in 1929  as a library for the College.  Marston Quadrangle is located between Carnegie Building and Bridges Auditorium, one of two <a>quadrangles</a> on campus. The <a>Pomona College Organic Farm</a> is hidden behind The Wash on the southeastern corner of campus.</p>
<p>North Campus is also a mix of residential and academic buildings.  Most of the academic buildings house science departments.  Among the notable buildings are the Richard C. Seaver Biology Building (&#x201c;Seaver West&#x201d;), built with <a>environmentally friendly</a> features, completed in 2005, and the Lincoln and Edmunds buildings, both completed in 2007. </p>
<p>The Lincoln and Edmunds buildings were the first buildings in Claremont to garner a gold certification award from the U.S. Green Building Council&#x2019;s <a>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) Program.  The two new academic buildings also house the first publicly accessible Skyspace art installation by renowned artist and alumnus <a>James Turrell</a> '65.</p>
<p>North Campus dormitories house mostly juniors and seniors.  Of interest is Smiley Hall, the oldest dorm West of the Mississippi, constructed in 1908.  While it is south of Sixth Street, it is still considered a North Campus dorm.  Frary Dining Hall, one of two dining halls on campus, is the location of the murals &#x201c;Prometheus&#x201d; by <a>Jos&#x00e9; Clemente Orozco</a>, his first work in the US, and &#x201c;Genesis&#x201d; by <a>Rico Lebrun</a>.</p>
<p>Also located along the south side of Sixth Street are buildings central to the campus.  Smith Campus Center is home to many student services, including a mailroom, The Coop student store and two restaurants; Alexander Hall houses administrative offices.  Athletic facilities are located to the south of Sixth Street and to the east of Smiley Hall.  The Rains Center is the main athletic facility with a fitness center, gym and locker rooms.  Adjacent to Rains Center is Merritt Football Field, Alumni Baseball Field and Haldeman Pool.  Other Pomona facilities of note include the student group and lounge in Walker Hall known as the <a>Women's Union</a>, the Sontag Greek Theatre&#x2014;an outdoor amphitheater, as well as <a>The Farm</a>, an experiment in <a>sustainable farming</a> and the Seaver Theatre Complex, built in 1990  with a 335-seat auditorium, 100-seat experimental theater and several other studios and rehearsal spaces.</p>
<p>[[File:San Gabriel Mountains, Pomona College.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[San Gabriel Mountains]] from South Campus]] The campus lies less than five miles (8&nbsp;km) south of the <a>San Gabriel Mountains</a>, on top of the <a>alluvial fans</a> that have come from nearby San Antonio Canyon.  The campus is relatively flat, with a slight uphill grade from south to north, because of this.  <a>Mount San Antonio</a> (also known as Mount Baldy) is 14 miles (22&nbsp;km) north of the College and is visible from the campus.  The <a>Mount Baldy Ski Lifts</a> is a popular spot for students to ski in the winter because of its convenient location.  On clear days, the Chino Hills are visible to the south and <a>San Bernardino Mountains</a> to the east.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>The Claremont Colleges</h3>
<p>Pomona is a member of the <a>Claremont Colleges</a>, and most social activities revolve around the five colleges, or &quot;5-Cs&quot;. Pomona College, <a>Claremont McKenna College</a>, <a>Scripps College</a>, <a>Pitzer College</a>, and <a>Harvey Mudd College</a> share dining halls, libraries, and other facilities throughout the contiguous campuses. All five colleges, along with <a>Claremont Graduate University</a> and the <a>Keck Institute</a>, are part of the <strong><a>Claremont University Consortium</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Any student attending Pomona can enroll in up to half of his or her classes at the other four colleges and can major at any of the other four schools so long as the requested major is not offered at Pomona. This policy is similar across the Claremont Colleges; it is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while maintaining the positive qualities of a small liberal-arts college.</p>
<p>Over the years, a rivalry has formed between the opposing sports teams: Pomona-Pitzer (P-P) and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (CMS). In reality, these teams consist mostly of students enrolled at either Pomona or Claremont McKenna, respectively, which has intensified the rivalry between these particular neighbors.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>The acceptance rate has fallen from 16.3% of applicants accepted in 2007 to 14% in 2010, making Pomona the 9th most selective private college in the nation.  The Class of 2014 has median scores of 730 on the <a>SAT</a> critical reading section, 740 on the math section, and 740 on the writing section. The median <a>ACT</a> score is 33.  Ninety-two percent of this incoming class (of those from schools that officially rank students) graduated in the top <a>decile</a> of their <a>high school</a> classes, with 21% being valedictorians and salutatorians. The total cost of <a>tuition</a>, <a>room and board</a> and other fees will be about $43,155 in the 2006-2007 school year. it was ranked 39th in American institutions in 2005.  Its endowment per student in the 2007 fiscal year was $1,138,888, ranked 6th in U.S. institutions and first among liberal arts colleges.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Campus organizations</h3>
<p><a>left|300px|thumb|Pomona College in winter</a> There are several newspapers operated at the Claremont Colleges, including <em>The Collage</em> and <em><a>The Student Life</a></em>, which is the oldest college newspaper in Southern California. Other campus publications include political magazines <em>The Undecided</em>, the <em>Claremont Port Side</em>, the<em>Claremont Independent</em>, and the <em>Claremont Progressive</em>; and the literary magazine, <em>Passwords</em>.</p>
<p>The <a>Claremont Colleges Queer Resource Center</a> is a student center addressing the needs and concerns of <a>LGBT</a> students at all five colleges.</p>
<p>The major resource center and student group at Pomona College addressing gender issues is the Women's Union. </p>
<p>The campus also has an active environmental group, the Pomona Campus Climate Challenge group, that is focused on tackling climate change and creating a culture of sustainability on campus.</p>
<p>Pomona has a long tradition of student-run a cappella singing groups:  Men's Blue and White, Women's Blue and White, the Claremont Shades, Midnight Echo, and Mood Swing.</p>
<p>There are three remaining local fraternities (originally there were seven), and no officially recognized national fraternities or sororities. Two of the three fraternities are for male Pomona students only (Kappa Delta and Sigma Tau), while membership in the third (Nu Alpha Phi) is open to students of any gender.</p>
<p>The Pomona Student Union (PSU) facilitates the discussion of political and social issues on campus. The PSU is a non-partisan, student-run organization that invites prominent speakers from across the political spectrum to talk and debate. The PSU aims to raise the level of honest and open dialogue on campus. The PSU was founded on the belief that one cannot possess a firm belief in anything unless it is challenged. To this end, the PSU seeks to foster an environment in which students are exposed to a multiplicity of perspectives. Notable speakers the PSU has brought in include <a>Jon Meacham</a>, <a>Mari Matsuda</a>, <a>Sam Harris</a>, <a>Nadine Strossen</a>, and <a>Michael Isikoff</a>.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>The school's athletic program participates, in conjunction with <a>Pitzer College</a> (another consortium member), in the <a>Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> and the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division III. Once known as the Huns, the school's sports teams are now called the <a>Sagehen</a>s. On October 6, 1923, Pomona College and USC played in the inaugural game at the <a>Los Angeles Coliseum</a>, with the Trojans prevailing 23-7.</p>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p>Pomona is a residential campus, and students must apply to live off campus. Virtually all students live on campus for all four years in one of Pomona's 12 residence halls.</p>
<p>;South Campus All first-year students live on South Campus. As a result, the four residence halls that line Bonita Avenue are sometimes referred to as Freshman Row.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mudd-Blaisdell is Pomona's largest residence hall. It is home to 280 students living in doubles and singles. It is the only air-conditioned hall that houses first years.</li>
  <li>Harwood Court houses 170 students. It was built in 1921, is the oldest residence hall on South Campus, and the second-oldest west of the Mississippi (after Smiley).</li>
  <li>Wig Hall was built in the 1960s and houses 113 students, primarily first-years, mostly in doubles.</li>
  <li>Lyon Court is the only nearly all-freshman residence hall. It houses 78 students, mostly in doubles.</li>
  <li>Oldenborg Center is home to 140 students, mostly sophomores. Oldenborg residents live in language or special interest halls, and are expected to participate in the Center's extracurricular activities, which include foreign language film series, speakers, and other activities. Oldenborg also contains a foreign language dining hall, which serves lunch Monday through Friday. The Center is air-conditioned.</li>
  <li>The Cottages are three small, separate housing units on the corner of College and Bonita across the street from Wig. The Cottages house roughly 12 students and are a sub-free housing option.</li>
</ul>
<p>;North Campus Most residents of North Campus are juniors and seniors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smiley Hall is Pomona's oldest residence hall, and the oldest west of the Mississippi River. It was built in 1908 and houses 60 students, all in singles. Currently, the first two floors of Smiley are home to Unity Dorm, while the third is regular housing.</li>
  <li>Walker Hall houses 112 students in singles and two-room doubles. First-year transfer students live in Walker.</li>
  <li>Clark I contains two five-person suites, as well as two-room doubles. 116 students live in Clark I.</li>
  <li>Clark V has space for 95 students in singles and two-room doubles.</li>
  <li>Norton-Clark III is home to 120 students in singles and one- and two-room doubles.</li>
  <li>Lawry Court consists of three towers, each of which has three floors. Each floor contains eight single rooms around a common room and bathroom. 71 students live in Lawry Court (the first floor of the B tower has an electrical room).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Pomona's Board of Trustees adopted the College's first Environmental Policy in 2002. The school subsequently hired its first Sustainability Coordinator in 2008 and its Sustainability Integration Office was created in 2009. The College buys local and organic food for its dining halls, has undertaken a variety of outreach initiatives; requires that all new construction meet LEED Silver standards; offsets a percentage of its emissions with Renewable Energy Credits; and is committed to reducing water consumption, especially in landscaping. The College was awarded a &quot;B&quot; for its sustainability initiatives by the Sustainable Endowments Institute in the College Sustainability Report Card 2009.</p>
<h2>Unique traditions</h2>
<h3>47</h3>
<p>The number &quot;<a>47</a>&quot; has held mystical importance for Pomona students for almost forty-seven years. Two different stories about its roots exist. Campus lore suggested that in 1964, Pomona math professor Donald Bentley produced a convincing mathematical proof that 47 was equal to all other integers, and that other faculty members and senior students could not disprove his equation at first sight. (By the 1970s oral history had grown this tale into a 1950s McCarthy-era exercise by an unnamed professor, and that it was a symbolic attack on the &quot;big lie&quot; political style of the Red-hunters of the era.) Another version &#x2014; later verified by Bentley &#x2014; holds that two Pomona students on a summer grant project in 1964 hypothesized that 47 occurred far more often in nature than random number distribution would explain. Pomona College is also located off exit 47 on <a>Interstate 10</a>.</p>
<p>This tradition is endorsed by the college, as seen in Pomona College's official website's explanation of the &quot;mystery of 47&quot;.</p>
<h3>Mufti</h3>
<p>Rooted somewhere in the mists of the 1940s, originally the outgrowth of an unhappy group of women students protesting on-campus policies, Mufti is a secret society of <a>pun</a>sters-as-social-commentators. Periodically their 3.5&quot;x8.5&quot; sheets of paper are glued to walls all over campus, with double-entendre comments on local goings-on: when beloved century-old Holmes Hall was dynamited to make way for a new building in 1987, the tiny signs all over campus announced &quot;BLAST OF A CENTURY LEAVES THOUSANDS HOLMESLESS.&quot;</p>
<h3>Gwendolyn Rose</h3>
<p>Rose is the campus ghost, widely believed to haunt the basement and staircases of Sumner Hall. It is believed that she committed suicide in the woman's bathroom during construction of the building. Although the exact reasons for her suicide are unknown, it is believed that she witnessed her husband being unfaithful. Though the building was originally planned as a hotel, after her suicide the building was sold to Pomona College and was adopted into an administrative building. Students, housekeepers, and deans believe that she can be seen at late hours, often wearing a long white dress. Others have reported a moaning or crying sound coming from the stairs when no one else is believed to be nearby.</p>
<h3><em>Star Trek</em> connection</h3>
<p>Pomona College also has many connections to the <a>Star Trek</a> universe. In addition to the incorporation of the college's mystical number 47,  a writer for the series who attended Pomona College (<a>Joe Menosky</a>) may have used the <a>Oldenborg Center</a> as inspiration for <a>the Borg</a>, a drone-like race of assimilated half-machine creatures.  The foreign language dormitory was popularly referred to as &quot;the Borg&quot; long before <em><a>Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, and for many years the students who chose to live there had the reputation of never leaving the building except to attend classes (the air-conditioned building has its own dining hall, theatre, library, and computer rooms). Even the cube-shaped spacecraft of the television series is reminiscent of the design of the dorm (which from the air resembles the letter E).  Menosky has neither confirmed nor denied the well-reported account.</p>
<h2>Recent controversies</h2>
<h3>Pomona alma mater</h3>
<p>The alma mater recently attracted some controversy when it was discovered that the song was originally written to be sung as the ensemble finale to a student-produced blackface <a>minstrel show</a> performed on campus in 1909 or 1910. Due to this controversy, the Alma Mater was not sung during the 2008 commencement ceremony to give the college time to consider the song's future at Pomona.  On December 15, 2008 the college announced a decision to retain the song as the Alma Mater, but 'for the present' not to sing the song at either commencement or convocation.</p>
<h3>Labor conflicts</h3>
<p>On March 1, 2010, Pomona's dining service workers publicly announced their intention to attempt to form an independent labor union.  That morning over 40 workers and 150 students marched from Pomona's two dining halls into President <a>David Oxtoby</a>'s office and handed him petitions one at a time.  The petitions called for a &quot;Fair Process,&quot; asking the College to remain neutral during the unionization process and to acknowledge the results of a <a>card check</a>.  As of March 29, 90% of dining hall staff and 50% of Pomona students had signed the petition. </p>
<p>On March 3, 2010, Oxtoby responded to the petitions, suggesting that the College would only support an <a>NLRB</a>-regulated secret ballot. </p>
<p>On March 6, 2010, following Oxtoby's statement, workers and students rallied outside of Bridges Auditorium, marching over to Smith Campus Center in the midst of trustee meetings.  Several workers spoke about specific grievances, followed by Pomona students, Pitzer Professor Jose Calderon, and Anthony Chavez, the grandson of <a>Cesar Chavez</a>. A vigil on March 24 called for labor peace, with a demonstration of over 300 students, professors, and community members.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni and faculty</h2>
<p> Famous alumni of Pomona College include Walt Disney Company Executive <a>Roy E. Disney</a> (1951), writer, actor, and musician <a>Kris Kristofferson</a> (1954), Civil Rights activist and NAACP chairman <a>Myrlie Evers</a> (1968), and <em>New York Times</em> executive editor <a>Bill Keller</a> (1970), and six-time Grammy Winning conductor <a>Robert Shaw</a> (1938), as well as several <a>Academy Award</a>-winning screenwriters.  Notable faculty have included the late novelist <a>David Foster Wallace</a> and jazz musician <a>Bobby Bradford</a>.</p>
