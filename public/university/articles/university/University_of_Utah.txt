<p>The <strong>University of Utah</strong>, also known as <strong>the U</strong> or <strong>the U of U</strong>, is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducational</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Salt Lake City</a>, <a>Utah</a>, United States.  The university was established in 1850 as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>, As of 2010, there are 23,371 <a>undergraduate</a> students and 7,448 <a>graduate</a> students, for an enrollment total of 30,819; with 84% coming from Utah and 6% coming from foreign countries.]]The university was established on February 28, 1850, as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>, and <a>Orson Spencer</a> was appointed as the first chancellor of the university. Early classes were held in private homes or wherever space could be found. The university closed in 1853 due to lack of funds and lack of <a>feeder school</a>s.</p>
<p>Following years of intermittent classes in the Salt Lake City Council House, the university began to be reestablished in 1867 under the direction of <a>David O. Calder</a>, who was followed by <a>John R. Park</a> in 1869.  The university moved out of the council house into the Union Academy building in 1876 and into Union Square in 1884. In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, and <a>John R. Park</a> began arranging to obtain land belonging to the U.S. Army's <a>Fort Douglas</a> on the east bench of the <a>Salt Lake Valley</a>, where the university moved permanently in 1900. Additional <a>Fort Douglas</a> land has been granted to the university over the years, and the fort was officially closed on October 26, 1991. Upon his death in 1900, Dr. John R. Park bequeathed his entire fortune to the university.</p>
<p>The university grew rapidly in the early 20th century but was involved in an <a>academic freedom</a> controversy in 1915 when <a>Joseph T. Kingsbury</a> recommended that five faculty members be dismissed after a graduation speaker made a speech critical of mayor <a>William Spry</a>. One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals. Some felt that the dismissals were a result of the <a>LDS Church</a>'s influence on the university, while others felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive. The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later <a>The Great Depression</a> and World War II. Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but <a>A. Ray Olpin</a> was able to make substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964. Growth continued throughout the following decades as the university developed into a center for computer, medical, and other research.</p>
<p>During the <a>2002 Winter Olympics</a>, the university hosted the Olympic Village as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Prior to the events, the university received a facelift that included extensive renovations to the <a>Rice&#x2013;Eccles Stadium</a>, a new student center known as the Heritage Center, and a 134-room campus hotel and conference center.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

Huntsman Center</a>, the <a>Utah Museum of Natural History</a>, and the <a>Utah Museum of Fine Arts</a>, a museum with rotating exhibitions and a permanent collection of American, European, African, and Asian art. Venues for performing arts include <a>Kingsbury Hall</a>, used for touring companies and concerts, Pioneer Memorial Theatre, used by the professional <a>Pioneer Theatre Company</a>, David P. Gardner Hall, used by the School of Music and for musical performances, and the Marriott Center for Dance. <a>Red Butte Garden</a>, with formal gardens and natural areas, is located on the far east side of campus.</p>
<p>[[Image:Uofu medicalcenter.jpg|thumb|right|The health sciences complex and [[Utah Transit Authority|UTA]] <a>TRAX</a>]]The health sciences complex, at the northeast end of campus, includes the <a>University of Utah Medical Center</a>, <a>Primary Children's Medical Center</a>, the <a>Huntsman Cancer Institute</a>, the <a>Moran Eye Center</a>, and the Spencer Eccles Health Sciences Library. South of the health sciences complex, several university residence halls and apartments are clustered together near <a>Fort Douglas</a> and the Heritage Center, which serves as a student center and cafeteria for this area. In addition, there are 1,115 university apartments for students, staff, and faculty across three apartment complexes on campus. At the southeast end of campus is <a>Research Park</a>, which is home to research companies including <a>ARUP Laboratories</a>, <a>Evans &amp; Sutherland</a>, <a>Sarcos</a>, <a>Idaho Technology</a>, and <a>Myriad Genetics</a>.</p>
<p>Courses are also held at off-campus centers located in <a>Bountiful</a>, <a>Murray</a>, <a>Park City</a>, downtown <a>Salt Lake City</a>, and <a>Sandy</a>.</p>
<h3>Transportation and sustainability</h3>
<p>A number of campus shuttles, running on biodiesel and used vegetable oil, The <a>Utah Transit Authority</a> (UTA) runs several buses through the university area as well as the <a>TRAX</a> <a>University Line</a> (<a>light rail</a>), which travels through downtown Salt Lake City, where riders can transfer to the <a>Sandy / Salt Lake Line</a>, and terminates at the <a>Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub</a>, where riders can transfer to <a>FrontRunner</a> (<a>heavy rail</a>). UTA runs limited trains directly from the university to Sandy on the <a>Sandy / University Line</a>. Students and staff are given free passes to ride UTA buses, TRAX, and FrontRunner.</p>
<p>The university is ranked 4th by the <a>EPA</a> for annual <a>green power</a> usage among universities, with 23% of its power coming from <a>wind</a> and <a>solar</a> sources. Other sustainability efforts include a permanent sustainability office, a campus <a>cogeneration</a> plant, building upgrades and energy efficient building standards, behavior modification programs, purchasing local <a>produce</a>, and student groups including a bicycle collective. Sustainability and transportation are also a large part of the university's campus master plan. The Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the university a &quot;B&quot; in its College Sustainability Report Card 2010, with A's for administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, and transportation.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The university offers 72 undergraduate majors, more than 70 minors and certificates, more than 40 teaching majors and minors, and 95 major fields of study at the graduate level. Students at the undergraduate level can also create an individualized major under the direction of the Bachelor of University Studies program and the supervision of a <a>tenure-track</a> faculty member. In late 2009 the University announced that it would be adding a <a>Masters in Real Estate</a> program to their offerings. The university has three semesters a year: spring, summer, and fall. Tuition and fees for 2008&#x2013;2009 were US$2,226 for Utah residents and $6,954 for non-residents per 12-credit-hour semester.&lt;!-- see labels tab for interpretation of basic classification &quot;basic2005&quot; column --&gt; with research and training awards for 2007&#x2013;2008 amounting to US$298,044,997. For <a>technology transfer</a>, the university was responsible for the 2nd highest number of startups in both 2006 and 2007, just behind <a>MIT</a>. </p>
<h3>Admissions and demographics</h3>
<p>In 2007&#x2013;2008, the university accepted 94% and admitted 80% of its 16,933 domestic undegraduate applicants; accepted 94% and admitted 66% of its 1,017 international undergraduate applicants; accepted 80% and admitted 44% of its 6,773 domestic graduate applicants; and accepted 70% and admitted 38% of its 1,992 international graduate applicants.</p>
<p>Of admitted freshmen, the average <a>GPA</a> was 3.4 and the average <a>ACT</a> score was 23.5.</p>
<p>In 2010, the undergraduate and graduate student body was 30,819, with 23,371 <a>undergraduate</a> students and 7,448 <a>graduate</a> students. 71% of students were full-time, 56% were male and 44% female, 84% were Utah residents, and 6% were foreign students. The university was ranked 20th by <a>The Princeton Review</a> for having the most religious students in the nation in 2009.  </p>
<h3>Notable programs</h3>
<p>The University of Utah has the only accredited <a>architecture</a> program in Utah, as well as the only <a>medical school</a>. and 29th in the nation for primary care.</p>
<p>The <a>S.J. Quinney College of Law</a>, founded in 1913, was the only <a>law school</a> in Utah until the 1970s. In 2010, it was ranked 42nd in the nation by <em>U.S. News</em>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The Warnock Engineering Building</a>In 2009, the university's <a>College of Engineering</a> graduate program was ranked 62nd in the nation by <em>U.S. News</em>. The university's School of Computing, part of the College of Engineering, was ranked 39th in the nation. The University of Utah was one of the original four nodes of <a>ARPANET</a>, the world's first <a>packet-switching</a> computer network and embryo of the current worldwide <a>Internet</a>.  Notable innovations of faculty and alumni include the first method for representing surface textures in graphical images, the <a>Gouraud shading</a> model, magnetic ink printing technology, the Johnson counter <a>logic circuit</a>, the oldest algebraic mathematics package still in use (<a>REDUCE</a>), the <a>Phong reflection model</a>, the <a>Phong shading</a> method, and the <a>rendering equation</a>. The school has pioneered work in <a>asynchronous circuit</a>s, <a>computer animation</a>, <a>computer art</a>, digital <a>music recording</a>, <a>graphical user interface</a>s, and <a>stack machine</a> architectures. The School of Computing also takes part in the <a>Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>, which continues to make advances in visualization, scientific computing, and image analysis.</p>
<p>In the sciences, <em>U.S. News</em> ranked the university 36th in chemistry (2007) and 43rd in earth sciences (2006) among national graduate programs, and the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> ranked the university 43rd in the world in the life and agricultural sciences in 2009. The university has made unique contributions to the study of <a>genetics</a> due in part to long-term <a>genealogy</a> efforts of the <a>LDS Church</a>, which has allowed researchers to trace genetic disorders through several generations. The relative homogeneity of Utah's population also makes it an ideal laboratory for studies of population genetics. The university is home to the Genetic Science Learning Center, a resource which educates the public about genetics through its website.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uofu huntsmancenter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon M. Huntsman Center]] serves as a basketball and gymnastics venue]]</p>
<p>The university has 7 men's and 11 women's varsity teams. The school's sports teams are called the <a>Ute</a>s, though some teams have an additional nickname, such as &quot;Runnin' Utes&quot; for the men's basketball team. The university participates in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> (<a>FBS</a> for football) as part of the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>. However, beginning in the 2011&#x2013;2012 academic year, Utah will play in the Southern Division of the PAC-12 Conference. There is a fierce <a>Utah&#x2013;BYU rivalry</a>, and the <a>Utah&#x2013;BYU football game</a>, traditionally a season finale, has been called the &quot;Holy War&quot; by national broadcasting commentators. The university <a>fight song</a> is <a>&quot;Utah Man&quot;</a>, commonly played at athletic games and other university events. </p>
<p>In 2002, the university was one of 20 schools to make the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> College Sports Honor Roll. In 2005, Utah became the first school to produce #1 overall draft picks in both the <a>NFL Draft</a> and <a>NBA Draft</a> for the same year. <a>Alex Smith</a> was picked first overall by the <a>San Francisco 49ers</a> in the <a>2005 NFL Draft</a>, and <a>Andrew Bogut</a> was picked first overall by the <a>Milwaukee Bucks</a> in the <a>2005 NBA Draft</a>. The university has won ten <a>NCAA Skiing Championships</a>, most recently in 2003, as well as the 1977 <a>AIAW</a> National Women's Skiing Championship.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The men's basketball team won the <a>NCAA</a> title in <a>1944</a> and the <a>NIT</a> crown in 1947. <a>Arnie Ferrin</a>, the only four-time All-American in Utah basketball history, played for both the 1944 and 1947 teams. He also went on to help the <a>Minneapolis Lakers</a> win <a>NBA</a> Championships in 1949 and 1951. <a>Wat Misaka</a>, the first person of Asian descent to play in the NBA, also played for Utah during this era.</p>
<p>Utah basketball rose again to national prominence when head coach <a>Rick Majerus</a> took his team, including guard <a>Andre Miller</a>, combo forward <a>Hanno M&#x00f6;tt&#x00f6;l&#x00e4;</a>, and post player <a>Michael Doleac</a>, to the NCAA <a>Final Four</a> in <a>1998</a>. After eliminating <a>North Carolina</a> to advance to the final round, Utah lost the championship game to <a>Kentucky</a>, 78&#x2013;69.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p></p>
<p>[[Image:UtesRiceEccles2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rice&#x2013;Eccles Stadium]] during a football game]]In 2004&#x2013;2005, the football team, coached by <a>Urban Meyer</a> and quarterbacked by <a>Alex Smith</a>, along with defensive great <a>Eric Weddle</a>, went 11&#x2013;0 during the regular season and defeated <a>Pittsburgh</a> 35&#x2013;7 in the <a>2005 Fiesta Bowl</a>, becoming the first team from a conference without an automatic <a>Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) bid to go to a BCS bowl game. The team ended its perfect 12&#x2013;0 season ranked 4th in <a>AP</a> polling.</p>
<p>2008&#x2013;2009 was another undefeated year for the football team, coached by <a>Kyle Whittingham</a>, as they finished the season 13&#x2013;0 and defeated Alabama 31&#x2013;17 in the <a>2009 Sugar Bowl</a>. Utah finished the season 2nd in <a>AP</a> polling, their highest rank ever. At the end of the season, the Utes were the only unbeaten team in the country, with the nation's longest active streak of bowl victories (8).</p>
<p>The Utah Utes will move to the <a>PAC-10</a> conference at the start of the 2011-2012 football season. They will be in the South Division with <a>University of Colorado</a>, <a>University of Arizona</a>, <a>Arizona State University</a>, <a>UCLA</a> and <a>University of Southern California</a>. Their first game in the <a>PAC-10</a> will be at <a>USC</a> on September 10, 2011.</p>
<h3>Gymnastics</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The women's gymnastics team, the <a>Red Rocks</a>, has won ten national championships, including the 1981 <a>AIAW</a> championship, and placed 2nd nationally eight times. As of 2009, it has qualified for the <a>NCAA championship</a> every year, the only program to do so. The program has averaged over 11,000 fans per meet 1992&#x2013;2010 and has been the NCAA gymnastics season attendance champions 16 of these 19 years. In 2010, there was an average of 14,213 fans per meet, the largest crowd being 15,030.</p>
<h3>Marching band</h3>
<p>The university <a>marching band</a>, known as the &quot;Pride of Utah&quot;, perform at all home football games, as well as some away games and bowl games. They performed at the <a>2005 BCS Tostitos Fiesta Bowl</a>, the <a>2009 BCS Allstate Sugar Bowl</a>, and the Inaugural Parade of President <a>Barack Obama</a>. As of 2009, the band is under the direction of Dr. Brian Sproul.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uofu union.jpg|thumb|right|[[A. Ray Olpin]] University Union and courtyard]]A large portion of university students live off-campus, as the university is located in a large <a>metropolitan area</a> and has beds for less than 10% of its undergraduate population in <a>residence halls</a> and single student apartments. An additional 1,115 family apartments are available to students, staff, and faculty. One of the university's primary four goals for long-term campus growth is to increase student engagement through the addition of on-campus housing, intramural fields, athletic centers, and a new <a>student activity center</a>.</p>
<p>The current student activity center, the <a>A. Ray Olpin</a> University Union, is a common gathering place for university-wide events such as Crimson Nights, roughly monthly student activity nights; PlazaFest, a fair for campus groups at the start of the school year; and the Grand Kerfuffle, a concert at the end of the school year. The building includes a cafeteria, computer lab, recreational facilities, and a ballroom for special events. The Union also houses the <a>Lowell Bennion</a> Community Service Center and ASUU (the Associated Students of the University of Utah), which is responsible for appropriating funds to student groups and organizations on campus. ASUU holds <a>primary</a> and <a>general election</a>s each year for student representatives, typically with 10&#x2013;15% of the student population voting.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of <a>LDS Church</a> members at the university, there is an LDS <a>Institute of Religion</a> building directly on campus, as well as several LDS student groups and 46 campus <a>wards</a>. Approximately 650 students participate in <a>fraternities and sororities</a> at the university, primarily located on &quot;Greek Row&quot; just off campus. The University of Utah has a <a>dry campus</a>, meaning that alcohol is banned on campus.</p>
<p>In 2004, <a>Utah</a> became the first state with a law expressly permitting <a>concealed weapons</a> on public university campuses. The University of Utah tried to uphold its gun ban but the <a>Utah Supreme Court</a> rejected the ban in 2006.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>[[Image:EBC northeast.JPG|thumb|right|[[Eccles Broadcast Center]] is home to three broadcast stations]]The university has several public broadcasting affiliations, many of which utilize the <a>Eccles Broadcast Center</a>. These stations include <a>KUED</a> channel&nbsp;7, a <a>PBS</a> member station and producer of local documentaries; <a>KUEN</a> channel&nbsp;9, an educational station for teachers and students from the <a>Utah Education Network</a>; <a>KUER</a> 90.1&nbsp;<a>FM</a>, a public radio affiliate of <a>National Public Radio</a>, <a>American Public Media</a>, and <a>Public Radio International</a>; and <a>K-UTE</a> 1620&nbsp;<a>AM</a> a student radio station combining talk, current events, and music.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Utah Chronicle</em>, also referred to as the <em>Chrony</em>, has been the university's independent, student-run paper since 1890. It publishes daily on school days during fall and spring semesters and weekly during summer semester. The paper typically runs between eight and twelve pages, with longer editions for weekend game guides. The paper converted to a <a>broadsheet</a> format in 2003 when the <a>Newspaper Agency Corporation</a> began printing it. Staff from the <em>Chronicle</em> feed into Utah journalism circles, some of them rising to considerable prominence, such as former editor Matt Canham, whose work with <em><a>The Salt Lake Tribune</a></em> earned him the Don Baker Investigative Reporting Award from the Utah Chapter of the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>University of Utah Press</a>, the oldest press in Utah and now part of the <a>J. Willard Marriott Library</a>, publishes books on topics including the outdoors, <a>anthropology</a> and <a>archaeology</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>creative nonfiction</a>, <a>Mesoamerica</a>, <a>Native American studies</a>, and <a>Utah</a>, <a>Mormon</a>, and Western history. The university is also home to a national literary journal, <em><a>Quarterly West</a></em>.</p>
