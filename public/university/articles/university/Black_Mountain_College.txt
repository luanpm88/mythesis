<p><strong>Black Mountain College</strong>, a school founded in 1933 in <a>Black Mountain, North Carolina</a>, was a new kind of college in the United States in which the study of art was seen to be central to a <a>liberal arts education</a>, and in which <a>John Dewey</a>'s principles of education played a major role. Many of the school's students and faculty were influential in the arts or other fields, or went on to become influential. Although notable even during its short life, the school closed in 1957 after only 24 years.  </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300 px|From 1933 to 1941, Black Mountain College was located at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly.</a> <a>thumb|right|300 px|Its Lake Eden campus, used from 1941 to 1957, is now part of Camp Rockmont, a summer camp for boys.</a></p>
<p>Founded in 1933 by <a>John Andrew Rice</a>, <a>Theodore Dreier</a>, and other former faculty members of <a>Rollins College</a>, Black Mountain was experimental by nature and committed to an <a>interdisciplinary</a> approach, attracting a faculty that included many of America's leading visual artists, composers, poets, and designers, like <a>Buckminster Fuller</a>, who popularized and named the <a>geodesic dome</a>.</p>
<p>Operating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget, Black Mountain College inculcated an informal and collaborative spirit and over its lifetime attracted a venerable roster of instructors. Some of the innovations, relationships, and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain would prove to have a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene, high culture, and eventually <a>pop culture</a>. <a>Buckminster Fuller</a> met student <a>Kenneth Snelson</a> at Black Mountain, and the result was the first <a>geodesic dome</a> (improvised out of slats in the school's back yard); <a>Merce Cunningham</a> formed his dance company; and <a>John Cage</a> staged his first <a>happening</a> (the term itself is traceable to Cage's student <a>Allan Kaprow</a>, who applied it later to such events). </p>
<p>Not a haphazardly conceived venture, Black Mountain College was a consciously directed <a>liberal arts</a> school that grew out of the <a>progressive education</a> movement. In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it, and as such an important incubator for the American <a>avant garde</a>. Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today ranging from the <a>University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, and <a>Marlboro College</a> to <a>Evergreen State College</a>, <a>Bennington College</a>, <a>Shimer College</a>, <a>Prescott College</a>, <a>Goddard College</a>, and <a>New College of Florida</a>, among others, including <a>Warren Wilson College</a> located just minutes down the road from where Black Mountain College was located. </p>
<p>For the first eight years, the college rented the <a>YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly</a> buildings south of <a>Black Mountain town</a>. In 1941, it moved across the valley to its own campus at Lake Eden where it remained until its closing in 1956. The property was later purchased and converted to an ecumenical Christian boys' residential summer camp (<a>Camp Rockmont</a>), which later became a long-time location of the <a>Black Mountain Festival</a> and the <a>Lake Eden Arts Festival</a>. A number of the original structures are still in use as lodgings or administrative facilities.</p>

<h3>Black Mountain poets</h3>
<p>Various avant-garde poets (subsequently known as the <a>Black Mountain poets</a>) were drawn to the school through the years, most notably <a>Charles Olson</a>, <a>Robert Duncan</a>, <a>Denise Levertov</a>, <a>Jonathan Williams</a>, <a>Ed Dorn</a>, and <a>Robert Creeley</a>. Creeley was hired to teach and to edit the <em>Black Mountain Review</em> in 1955, and when he left two years later for San Francisco, he became the link between the Black Mountain poets and the poets of the <a>San Francisco Renaissance</a>. Through <a>Allen Ginsberg</a>, a link with the <a>Beat generation</a> writers of <a>Greenwich Village</a> was initiated.</p>
