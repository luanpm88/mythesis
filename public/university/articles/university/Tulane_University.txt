<p><strong>Tulane University</strong> (officially <strong>The Tulane University of Louisiana</strong> or simply <strong>TU</strong>) is a <a>private</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>New Orleans</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, <a>United States</a>.  Founded as a public medical college in 1834, the school grew into a comprehensive university in 1847 and was eventually privatized under the endowments of <a>Paul Tulane</a> and <a>Josephine Louise Newcomb</a> in 1884. Tulane is a member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> and the colloquial <a>Southern Ivy League</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding and early history &#x2013; 19th century</h3>
<p>[[File:Paul Tulane.gif|thumb|left|150px|[[Paul Tulane]], eponymous philanthropist of the school]] The university was founded as the <strong>Medical College of Louisiana</strong> in 1834 partly as a response to the fears of <a>smallpox</a>, <a>yellow fever</a> and <a>cholera</a> in America. The university became only the second medical school in the South, and the 15th in the United States at the time.  In 1847, the state legislature established the school as <strong><a>The University of Louisiana</a></strong>, The university became privatized, and is the only American university to be converted from a state public institution to a private one.</p>
<p>In 1885, the university established its graduate division, later becoming the Graduate School.  One year later, gifts from <a>Josephine Louise Newcomb</a> totaling over $3.6 million, led to the establishment of the <a>H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College</a> within Tulane University.  Newcomb was the first coordinate college for women in the United States and became a model for such institutions as <a>Pembroke College</a> and <a>Barnard College</a>.  In 1925, Tulane established the independent Graduate School. Two years later, the university set up a <a>School of Social Work</a>, also the first in the southern United States.</p>
<p><a>University College</a> was established in 1942 as Tulane's division of continuing education. By 1950, the School of Architecture had grown out of Engineering into an independent school. In 1958, the university was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, an organization consisting of sixty-two of the leading research universities in North America.   The <a>School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine</a> again became independent from the School of Medicine in 1967. Originally established in 1912, it was arguably one of the first public health schools in the United States. Tulane's School of Tropical Medicine also remains the only one of its kind in the country.  On April 23, 1975, President <a>Gerald R. Ford, Jr.</a>, spoke at Tulane University's Fogelman Arena at the invitation of Congressman <a>F. Edward Hebert</a>, a representative of Louisiana&#x2019;s 1st Congressional District. During the historic speech, Ford announced that the Vietnam War was &quot;finished as far as America is concerned&quot; - one week before the fall of <a>Saigon</a>. Ford drew parallels to the <a>Battle of New Orleans</a>, saying that such positive activity could do for America&#x2019;s morale what the battle did in 1815.</p>
<h3>21st century</h3>
<p>[[File:Gibson Hall angle.jpg|right|thumb|Gibson Hall today. Facing historic [[St. Charles Avenue]], it is the entry landmark on the uptown campus.]]  In July 2004, Tulane received two $30 million donations to its <a>endowment</a>, the largest individual or combined gifts in the university's history.  The donations came from <a>Jim Clark</a>, a member of the university's board of trustees and founder of <a>Netscape</a>, and <a>David Filo</a>, a graduate of its School of Engineering and co-founder of <a>Yahoo!</a>.  A fund-raising campaign called &quot;Promise &amp; Distinction&quot; raised $730.6 million as of October 3, 2008, increasing the university's total endowment to more than $1.1 billion; by March 2009, Yvette Jones, Tulane's Chief Operating Officer, told Tulane's Staff Advisory Council that the endowment &quot;has lost close to 37%&quot;, affected by the <a>late-2000s recession</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2010, the Tulane admissions office reported that it had received 44,000 applications for the class of 2014, breaking the previous record set by the class of 2013.  While unable to confirm it officially, the admissions office stated that &#x201c;it appears that we have the most applications for the upcoming fall semester of any private university in the country.&#x201d;  </p>
<h4>Hurricane Katrina</h4>
<p> As a result of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a> in August 2005 and its damaging effects on New Orleans, most of the university was closed for the second time in its history&#x2014;the first being during the Civil War. The closing affected the first semester of the school calendar year.  The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine's distance learning programs and courses stayed active.  The School of Medicine relocated to <a>Houston, Texas</a> for a year.  Aside from student athletes attending college classes together on the same campuses, most undergraduate and graduate students dispersed to campuses throughout the U.S. </p>
<p>Facing a budget shortfall, the Board of Administrators announced a &quot;Renewal Plan&quot; in December 2005 to reduce its annual operating budget and create a &quot;student-centric&quot; campus.  Addressing the school's commitment to New Orleans, a course credit involving &quot;service learning&quot; became a requirement for an undergraduate degree. In 2006 Tulane became the first Carnegie ranked &#x201c;high research activity&#x201d; institution to have an undergraduate public service graduation requirement. In May 2006, graduation ceremonies included commencement speakers former Presidents <a>George H. W. Bush</a> and <a>Bill Clinton</a>, who commended the students for their willingness to return to Tulane and serve New Orleans in its renewal.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Uptown</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Gibson quad behind Gibson Hall, shaded by many large live oak trees.</a></p>
<p>Tulane's primary campus is located  in <a>Uptown New Orleans</a> on <a>St. Charles Avenue</a>, directly opposite of <a>Audubon Park</a>, and extends north to South Claiborne Avenue through Freret and Willow Street.  The campus is known colloquially as the Uptown or St. Charles campus. It was established in the 1890s and occupies more than  of land. The campus is known both for its large <a>live oak</a> trees as well as its architecturally historic buildings.  It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.  The campus architecture consists of several styles, including Richardsonian Romanesque, Elizabethan, Italian Renaissance, Mid-Century Modern, and contemporary styles. The front campus buildings use Indiana White Limestone or orange brick for exteriors, while the middle campus buildings are mostly adorned in red St. Joe brick, the staple of Newcomb College Campus buildings. <a>Loyola University</a> is directly adjacent to Tulane, on the downriver side.  <a>Audubon Place</a>, where the <a>President of Tulane</a> resides, is on the upriver side.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Tilton Memorial Hall, home to the Departments of Economics and Political Economy.</a></p>
<p>The centerpiece of the Gibson Quad is the first academic building built on campus, <a>Gibson Hall</a>, in 1894. The schools of Architecture and Social Work are also located on the oldest section of the campus.  The middle of the campus, between Freret and Willow Streets and bisected by <a>McAlister Place</a> and Newcomb Place, serves as the center of campus activities.  The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, <a>Fogelman Arena</a>, McAlister Auditorium, Howard-Tilton Memorial Library, and most of the student residence halls and academic buildings populate the center of campus.  The facilities for the <a>Freeman School of Business</a> line McAlister Place and sit next to the <a>Tulane Law School</a>. The middle campus is also home to the historic Newcomb College Campus, which sits between Newcomb Place and Broadway.  The Newcomb campus was designed by New York architect <a>James Gamble Rogers</a>, noted for his work with <a>Yale University</a>'s campus. The Newcomb campus is home to Tulane's performing and fine arts venues.  The back of campus, between Willow Street and South Claiborne, is home to two residence halls, Reily Recreation Center and <a>Turchin Stadium</a>, the home of Green Wave baseball.</p>
<p>After Hurricane Katrina, Tulane has continued to build new facilities and renovate old spaces on its campus.  The newest residence hall, Lallage Feazel Wall Residential College, was completed in August 2005 and took in its first students when Tulane re-opened in January 2006.  The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life was renovated to be a green, environmentally friendly building and opened for student use in January 2007. In 2009, the university altered McAlister Drive, a street that ran through the middle of the uptown campus into pedestrian walkway renamed McAlister Place. The area was resurfaced and the newly added green spaces were adorned with Japanese magnolias, irises and new lighting. Coincidentally, in late November 2008 the City of New Orleans announced plans to add bicycle lanes to the <a>St. Charles Avenue</a> corridor that runs in front of campus.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tulane is renovating <a>Dinwiddie Hall</a> to be the campus's first building to attain a Silver LEED certification award.  The Dinwiddie Hall renovation began in June 2009, and is expected to be finished in July 2010.  Tulane has also broken ground on a new residence hall, which will also apply for LEED certification.  This dorm, designed to be a residential college like the recently constructed Wall Residential College, will have 267 beds.[<a>http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/111209_residence_hall.cfm</a>]</p>

<h3>Environmental sustainability</h3>
<p>Tulane hosted an Environmental Summit at the law school in April 2009, an event that all students could attend for free. Many students from Tulane&#x2019;s two active environmental groups, Green Club and Environmental Law Society, attended. These student groups push for global citizenship and environmental stewardship on campus. In 2007 Tulane made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10%, and students help by reading the Energy Smart Shopping Guide and by visiting IT to green-up all of their electronics. Tulane recently received an &quot;A-&quot; on the <em>College Sustainability Report Card</em>.</p>
<h2>Organization and Academics</h2>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Tulane University, as a private institution, has been governed since 1884 by the Board of Tulane (also known as the Board of Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund) that was established in 1882.  There have been 14 <a>presidents of Tulane</a> since then. The board comprises more than 30 regular members (plus several members emeriti) and the University president. In 2008, Tulane became one of 76 U.S. colleges to maintain an endowment above $1 billion.</p>
<h3>Schools and divisions</h3>
<p>[[File:RichardsonMemorial.JPG|left|thumb|Richardson Memorial Hall, constructed 1908, home of the [[Tulane School of Architecture]].]]</p>
<p>Tulane is organized into 10 schools centered around liberal arts, sciences, and specialized professions. All undergraduate students are enrolled in the <a>Newcomb-Tulane College</a>. The graduate programs are governed by the individual schools. </p>
<p>Tulane is unique among universities in the United States in its academic organization in that all undergraduates are enrolled in <a>Newcomb-Tulane College</a> as well as being registered in the School which houses their major. Newcomb-Tulane College serves as an administrative center for all aspects of undergraduate life at Tulane, thus it is similar to <a>Yale</a> and <a>Harvard</a> universities in this type of undergraduate organization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first architecture courses at Tulane leading to a architectural engineering degree were offered in 1894. Intitially part of the College of Technology, the <a>Tulane School of Architecture</a> was separately formed as a school in 1953.  The Tulane School of Architecture ranks 32nd nationally for its research performance.</li>
  <li>The <a>A.B. Freeman School of Business</a> was named in honor of Alfred Bird Freeman, former chair of the Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and a prominent New Orleans philanthropist and civic leader.  The business school is ranked 44th nationally and 28th among programs at private universities by <em><a>Forbes magazine</a></em>.  <em>US News &amp; World Report<strong>s 2010 edition ranked the MBA program 48th overall. It was ranked 28th nationally and 48th internationally by Mexican business magazine </strong></em>Expansion<em> (August 2007), and 17th nationally and 24th internationally by </em>Am&#x00e9;ricaEconom&#x00ed;a<em> magazine (August 2008).  Its finance program was ranked 10th in the world by the </em>Financial Times<em>.  The school ranked 13th nationally for entrepreneurship by </em>Entrepreneur<em> magazine (October 2006).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>[[File:TulaneU4Nov08JonesHall.jpg|right|thumb|Jones Hall, where the [[Tulane University Law School|School of Law]] was located from 1969 until 1995. It now acts as a Special Collections library and houses the Classical Studies, Jewish Studies, and Latin American Studies departments.]]</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Tulane University Law School</a>, established in 1847, is the 12th oldest law school in the United States. In 1990, it became the first law school in the United States to mandate pro bono work as a graduation requirement. <em>US News &amp; World Report<strong>s 2011 edition ranked the School of Law 48th overall and 11th in environmental law.  &quot;The Law School 100&quot; ranks Tulane as 34th, relying on a qualitative (rather than quantitative) assessment.  The 2010 <a>Leiter law-school rankings</a> put Tulane at 38th, based on student quality, using LSAT and GPA data.  The  <a>Hylton law-school rankings</a>, conducted in 2006, put Tulane at 39th.  The school's <a>maritime law</a> program is widely considered to be the best in the United States, with the <a>Tulane Maritime Law Journal</a> being the paramount admiralty law journal of the country. In May 2007, Tulane Law announced a <a>Strategic Plan</a> to increase student selectivity by gradually reducing the incoming JD class size from a historical average of 350 students per year to a target of 250 students per year within several years.  Meanwhile, the global <a>financial crisis of 2007-2009</a> has reportedly led to an increase in student selectivity in and of itself, as applications to law schools across the nation are estimated to have risen by 5% between 2008 and 2009, including a 15% increase at Tulane Law alone.</strong></em></li>
  <li>The <a>School of Liberal Arts</a> consists of 15 departments and 22 interdisciplinary programs. All of the departments offer an undergraduate major and minor.  According to the 2005 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index, Tulane's French program was ranked 6th in the country.  This index ranks departmental faculty at research universities based on their awards, grants, and publications.</li>
  <li>The <a>Tulane University School of Medicine</a> was founded in 1834 and is the 15th oldest medical school in the United States. Faculty have been noted for innovation. For example, in 1850 <a>J. Lawrence Smith</a> invented the <a>inverted microscope</a>. In the following year <a>John Leonard Riddell</a> invented the first practical microscope to allow binocular viewing through a single objective lens. In 2001 the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy started as the first major center in the U.S. to focus on research using <a>adult stem cell</a>s. The school has highly selective admissions, accepting only 175 medical students from more than 9,000 applications.  It comprises 20 academic departments: Anesthesiology, Biochemistry, Family and Community Medicine, Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics, Otolaryngology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry and Neurology, Radiology, Structural and Cellular Biology, Surgery and Urology. In 2008 <em>US News and World Reports</em> ranked the School of Medicine's research at 55th.</li>
  <li>The <a>Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine</a> is arguably one of the oldest public health schools in the U.S.  Although a program in hygiene was initiated in 1881, the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was not established until 1912 as a separate entity from the College of Medicine. In 1919 the separate school ceased to be an independent unit and was merged with the College of Medicine.  By 1967 the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine reestablished as a separate academic unit of Tulane.  In the fall of 2006, the School of Public Health began admitting undergraduate students.  <em>US News &amp; World Report<strong>s 2007 edition ranked the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine 13th among public health programs.</strong></em></li>
  <li>The <a>Tulane University School of Science and Engineering</a> offers degrees in Biological Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Cell and Molecular Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Engineering Physics, Environmental Biology, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Physics, Psychology, Psychology and Early Childhood Development with minors also in Engineering Science and Marine Biology. More information about the school and their offerings can be found at <a>http://tulane.edu/sse/</a></li>
  <li>In 1914 the Southern School of Social Sciences and Public Services was the first training program for social workers in the <a>Deep South</a>. By 1927 the school became a separate program with a two-year master of arts. The <a>Tulane University School of Social Work</a> has awarded the master of social work degrees to more than 4,700 students from all 50 of the United States and more than 30 other countries. </li>
  <li>Tulane offers <a>continuing education</a> courses and associate's and bachelor's degrees through the <a>Tulane School of Continuing Studies</a>.</li>
  <li>Tulane has several academic and research institutes and centers including <a>The Murphy Institute</a>, Newcomb College Center for Research on Women, The Roger Thayer Stone Center for Latin American Studies, and the Law School's Payson Center for International Development.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Core curriculum</h3>
<p>As part of the post-Hurricane Katrina Renewal Plan, the university initiated an extensive university-wide core curriculum.  Three major elements of the university core are (1) TIDES classes which is a freshmen seminar, (2) a two-class sequence for public service, and (3) a capstone experience for students to apply knowledge in their fields of study.  Many course requirements of the core curriculum can be certified through <a>Advanced Placement</a> (AP) exams or <a>International Baccalaureate</a> (IB) course credits, or placement exams in English and foreign languages offered by the university during orientation.  Some schools have different core requirements (e.g., students in the School of Science and Engineering are required to take fewer language classes than students in the School of Liberal Arts).</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Tulane was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1958. Tulane also is designated by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> as a research university with &quot;very high research activity.&quot; For 2007, Tulane reached the highest level of research funding in its history, exceeding $157.5 million. In 2008 Tulane was ranked by the Ford Foundation as the major international studies research institution in the South and one of the top 15 nationally. The <a>National Institutes of Health</a> ranks funding to Tulane at 79th.</p>

<p>The Dean's Honor Scholarship is a merit-based <a>scholarship</a> awarded by Tulane which covers full tuition for the duration of the recipient's undergraduate program.  The scholarship is offered to between 75 and 100 incoming freshmen by the Office of Undergraduate Admission, and is awarded only through a separate application.  This scholarship is renewable provided that the recipient maintains a minimum 3.0 <a>GPA</a> at the end of each semester and maintains continuous enrollment in a full-time undergraduate division.  Typically, recipients have SAT I scores of 1450 or higher or an ACT composite score of 33 or higher, rank in the top 5% of their <a>high school</a> graduating class, have a rigorous course load including honors and <a>Advanced Placement</a> classes, and an outstanding record of extracurricular activities. Notable recipients include <a>Sean M. Berkowitz</a>, <a>David Filo</a> and <a>Eric R. Palmer</a>.</p>
<p>After her death in 1999, Lallage Feazel Wall, daughter of interim <a>U.S. Senator</a> <a>William C. Feazel</a> and widow of <a>State Representative</a> <a>Shady R. Wall</a> of <a>West Monroe</a> left $18 million to Tulane to promote &quot;creativity&quot; among university faculty and staff.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The student body of Tulane University is represented by the Associated Student Body (ASB). In 1998, the students of Tulane University voted by referendum to split the Associated Student Body (ASB) Senate into two separate houses, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GAPSA). USG and GAPSA come together twice a semester to meet as the ASB Senate, where issues pertaining to the entire Tulane student body are discussed.  The meetings of the ASB Senate are presided over by the ASB President, the only student that represents all students of Tulane University.</p>
<p>Tulane maintains 3,350 beds in 12 residence halls on its uptown campus for undergraduate students.  Per the Renewal Plan instituted after Hurricane Katrina, Tulane requires all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, except those who are from surrounding neighborhoods in New Orleans.  Housing is not guaranteed for juniors and seniors.  Tulane has begun construction on a new residential college that will have roughly 250 new beds.  Construction is slated to be complete by fall 2011.</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p><a><em>The Tulane Hullabaloo</em></a> is the university's weekly student-run newspaper.  It is published every Friday of the academic year, except on holidays, and has received multiple <a>Pacemaker Awards</a>, the highest award in college journalism.</p>
<p>The <em>Jambalaya</em>, Tulane's <a>yearbook</a>, published annually since 1897, published its last edition (Volume 99) in 1995, because of funding and management problems.  In the fall of 2003, the <em>Jambalaya</em> was reestablished as a student club, and in the Spring of 2004, the centennial edition of the <em>Jambalaya</em> was published.  The staff now continues to publish a <em>Jambalaya</em> annually.</p>
<p>The student-run <a>radio station</a> of the university, <a>WTUL</a> New Orleans 91.5, began broadcasting on campus in 1971.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> [[File:Superdome Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Tulane's football team plays its home games in the [[Louisiana Superdome]].]] <a>left|150px</a> Tulane is a member of <a>Conference USA</a> in athletics and an official member of the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a>. The university was a charter member of the Southeastern Conference, in which it competed until 1966. Tulane, along with other academically-oriented, private schools had considered to form the &quot;Southern Ivy League&quot; (<a>Magnolia Conference</a>) in the 1950s. <a>Baseball</a> and women's <a>volleyball</a> are among its stronger sports. In 2008, Tulane reopened <a>Greer Field at Turchin Stadium</a>, a renovated baseball venue for its team. The baseball team consistently ranks among the top 25 in national polls such as <em><a>Baseball America</a></em>, <em><a>USA Today</a></em>/<a>ESPN</a>, and <em>Collegiate Baseball</em>. In 2001 and 2005, Tulane baseball finished with 56 wins and placed 5th at the <a>College World Series</a>.</p>
<p>The women's volleyball team, which plays in <a>Fogelman Arena</a>, won the 2008 Conference USA Championship tournament. Fogelman Arena was renovated for basketball in the fall of 2006. The Green Wave <a>football</a> team went 12-0 in 1998, winning the <a>Liberty Bowl</a> and finishing the season ranked No. 7 in the nation. The Green Wave also won the <a>Hawaii Bowl</a> in 2002, the <a>Liberty Bowl</a> in 1970, and the 1935 <a>Sugar Bowl</a>. Tulane once used <a>Tulane Stadium</a> on the uptown campus that seated more than 80,000 people, held three <a>Super Bowls</a>, and was the home of the <a>New Orleans Saints</a> and the Sugar Bowl.  The stadium was demolished in 1980. The football team now plays in the refurbished <a>Louisiana Superdome</a> and occasionally has played at <a>Tad Gormley Stadium</a> in <a>City Park</a>.</p>
<p>Tulane also participates in a variety of men's and women's intercollegiate sports such as basketball, track and cross country, swimming, tennis, and golf. Tulane's graduation rate for its student-athletes consistently ranks among the top of Division I athletics programs.  Most of the administrative and athletic support facilities (such as weight rooms, training center, locker rooms, conference rooms, and hall of fame displays) are located in the Wilson Athletic Center.</p>

<h2>Tulane in literature and media</h2>
<p> Tulane has been portrayed in several books, television shows and films. Also, several movies have been filmed at Tulane University, especially since tax credits from the state of Louisiana have drawn more productions to the new &quot;Hollywood South&quot; in the late 2000s. Also the uptown campus has been host to two movie premieres from 2006 to 2007.</p>
