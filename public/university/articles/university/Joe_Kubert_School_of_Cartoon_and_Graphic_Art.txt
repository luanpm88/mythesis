<p>  The <strong>Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art</strong>, or <strong>Joe Kubert School</strong>, located in <a>Dover</a>, <a>New Jersey</a>, is a three-year <a>technical school</a> that teaches the principles of <a>sequential art</a> and the particular craft of the <a>comics</a> industry as well as commercial <a>illustration</a>. The school's instructors are full-time professionals working in the industry, many of them graduates of the school themselves, and the instruction is hands-on and practical. The school has a reputation for demanding and intensive coursework, and has a dropout rate of roughly 30%.</p>
<p>Founded in September <a>1976</a> by <a>cartoonist</a> <a>Joe Kubert</a> (and his wife Muriel), it was and still is the only accredited school devoted entirely to cartooning. Its first graduating class of <a>1978</a> included <a>Stephen R. Bissette</a>, <a>Thomas Yeates</a>, and <a>Rick Veitch</a>, and its subsequent alumni include many other successful and well-known comics <a>penciler</a>s and <a>inker</a>s.</p>
