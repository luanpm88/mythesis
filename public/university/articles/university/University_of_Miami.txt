<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Miami</strong> (informally referred to as <strong>UM</strong>, <strong>U of M</strong>, <strong>U Miami</strong>, <strong>Miami</strong>, or <strong>The U</strong>) is a private, non-sectarian <a>university</a> founded in 1925 with its main campus in <a>Coral Gables</a>, <a>Florida</a>, a <a>medical campus</a> in the <a>Miami</a> <a>city proper</a> at the <a>Miami Civic Center</a>, and an <a>oceanographic</a> research facility on <a>Virginia Key</a>.</p>
<p>, the university currently enrolls 15,629 students in 12 separate colleges, including a <a>medical school</a>, <a>law school</a>, and a school focused on the study of <a>oceanography</a> and <a>atmospheric sciences</a>. These colleges offer approximately 115 undergraduate, 114 master&#x2019;s, 51 doctoral, and two professional areas of study. Over the years, the University's students have represented all 50 states and close to 150 foreign countries. With more than 13,000 full and part-time faculty and staff, UM is the sixth largest employer in <a>Miami-Dade County</a>.</p>
<p>Research is a component of each academic division, with UM attracting $326&nbsp;million per year in sponsored research grants. and its football team has won five national championships. At the time, there were three large state-funded universities in Florida for white males, white females, and African-Americans (<a>UF</a>, <a>FSU</a>, and <a>FAMU</a>, respectively). Originally, UM was intended to be a private college to serve white students as a <a>coeducational institution</a>. [[Image:UM Merrick, 1926.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[George E. Merrick]] (second from right) in February 1926 with guests at the <a>cornerstone ceremony</a> for UM's Merrick Building, named in honor of his father, Reverend Solomon Greasley Merrick]]</p>
<p>The University began in earnest in 1925 when <a>George E. Merrick</a>, the founder of Coral Gables, gifted  and nearly $5&nbsp;million dollars ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) to the effort. The University was chartered on April 18, 1925 by the Circuit Court for Dade County with an initial Board of Regents chaired by William E. Walsh, a <a>Miami Beach</a> municipal judge. By the fall of 1926, when the first class of 372 students enrolled at UM, the land boom had collapsed, and hopes for a speedy recovery were dashed by a <a>major hurricane</a>. </p>
<p>In 1929, Walsh and the other members of the Board of Regents resigned in the wake of the collapse of the Florida economy. UM's plight was so severe that students went door to door in Coral Gables collecting funds to keep it open. In July 1934, the University of Miami was reincorporated and a Board of Trustees replaced the Board of Regents. By 1940, community leaders were replacing faculty and administration as trustees. the <a>School of Business Administration</a> (1929), the School of Education (1929), the Graduate School (1941), the Marine Laboratory (1943, renamed in 1969 as the <a>Rosenstiel School</a>), the School of Engineering (1947), and the <a>School of Medicine</a> (1952). A charter faculty member and a marine biologist by trade, African-American students were allowed full participation in student activities and sports teams. After President Stanford pressed for minority athletes, in December 1966, UM signed Ray Bellamy, an African-American football player. With Bellamy, UM became the first major college in the Deep South with an African-American football player on scholarship. UM established an Office of Minority Affairs to promote diversity in both undergraduate and professional school admissions. With the start of the 1968 football season, President Henry Stanford barred the playing of &quot;<a>Dixie</a>&quot; by the University's band.</p>
<p>Historically, UM regulated female student conduct more than men's conduct with a staff under the Dean of Women watching over the women. UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report on the status of women on campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, day care, and a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment of <a>Title IX</a> in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports. Today, UM is a diverse institution with an undergraduate enrollment that is 53% female, 28% Hispanic and 10% African-American.</p>
<p>From 1961 to 1968, UM leased buildings on its South Campus to serve as the covert headquarters of the <a>Central Intelligence Agency</a>'s <a>JMWAVE</a> operation against <a>Fidel Castro</a>'s government in <a>Cuba</a>. In 1968, after <em><a>Ramparts</a></em> magazine exposed CIA operations on other campuses, JMWAVE was moved off the UM campus out of concern for embarrassing the university.</p>
<p><a>Henry King Stanford</a> became UM's third president in 1962. The Stanford presidency saw increased emphasis on research, reorganization of administrative structure and construction of new facilities. Among the new research centers established were the Center for Advanced International Studies (1964), the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Evolution (1964), the Center for Theoretical Studies (1965), and the Institute for the Study of Aging (1975). Under Stanford, in 1965, UM began to recruit international students. Under Foote's leadership, on campus student housing was converted into a system of residential colleges. In addition, Foote initiated a five-year $400&nbsp;million fundraising campaign that began in 1984 and raised $517.5&nbsp;million. He saw the endowment expand from $47.4&nbsp;million in 1981 to $465.2&nbsp;million in 2000. Under Shalala, Miami has built new libraries, dormitories, symphony rehearsal halls, and classroom buildings. The university's academic quality and student quality also have improved as a result. During Shalala's leadership of the University of Miami, Miami hosted one of three nationally televised <a>U.S. presidential debates</a> of the <a>2004 U.S. Presidential election</a>. </p>
<p>Starting in 2002, UM conducted a fundraising campaign titled &quot;Momentum: The Campaign for the University of Miami&quot; that ultimately raised $1.37&nbsp;billion, Of that amount, $854&nbsp;million went to the medical campus. On November 30, 2007, UM acquired the Cedars Medical Center and renamed it the &quot;University of Miami Hospital&quot;, giving the Miller School of Medicine an in-house teaching hospital rather than being merely affiliated with area hospitals.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2006, custodial workers at the University of Miami, who are contracted to the university by a Boston, Massachusetts-based company, UNICCO, <a>began a strike</a> prompted by allegations of unfair labor practices, substandard pay, lack of health benefits, and workplace safety. After students began a hunger strike and on-campus vigil, the strike was settled on May 1, 2006. The settlement resulted in a card count which lead to the recognition of the first union-represented bargaining unit at UM.  UM raised wages from $6.40 to $8.35 per hour and provided health insurance.</p>
<p>In 2008-09, UM responded to the economic slowdown by tightening expenditures. While its endowment lost over 26.8% of its value, impacting endowment income, the school receives more than 98% of its operating budget from other sources. in <a>Coral Gables</a>, located immediately south of the city of Miami. Most of the University of Miami's academic programs are located on the main campus in Coral Gables, which houses seven schools and two colleges including the <a>University of Miami School of Law</a>. The campus has over  of building space valued at over $657&nbsp;million. Several other programs, including bilingual Continuing and International Education classes, are offered at the Koubek Center in Miami's <a>Little Havana</a>, the James L. Knight Center in downtown Miami, and the South and Richmond campuses in southwest <a>Miami-Dade</a> county.</p>
<p>The university also has a campus theater, the <a>Jerry Herman Ring Theatre</a>, which is used for student plays and musicals. The <a>John C. Gifford Arboretum</a>, a campus <a>arboretum</a> and <a>botanical garden</a>, is located on the northwest corner of the main campus in Coral Gables. The Jorge M. Perez Architecture Center is the gallery of the School of Architecture that displays exhibitions focusing on architecture and design.</p>
<p>The Coral Gables campus is served by the <a>Miami Metrorail</a> at the <a>University Station</a>. The Metro connects UM to <a>Downtown Miami</a>, <a>Brickell</a>, <a>Coconut Grove</a>, and other Miami neighborhoods. The UM campus is about a 15-minute train ride from Downtown and Brickell.</p>
<h4>Student housing</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The Coral Gables campus houses 4,450 enrolled students. This group is disproportionately freshmen (84% of new freshmen live on campus compared with 43% of all degree undergraduates). and the Walsh and Rosborough Towers of <a>Stanford</a> Residential College are commonly referred to as the &quot;Freshman Towers&quot;, as the single-sex by floor (with shared bathroom facilities) co-ed dormitories generally house new students. <a>Eaton</a> Residential College, which originally housed only women, and the <a>Mahoney</a>/<a>Pearson</a> Residential Colleges have suite-style housing with every two double-occupancy rooms connected by a shared bathroom.</p>
<p>In addition to these five residential colleges, Miami also has an area called the University Village which consists of seven buildings with <a>apartment</a>-style annual <a>contract</a> housing, fully furnished with kitchen facilities. The University Village is only open to juniors and seniors, but was previously open to graduate students and students of the School of Law up until July 31, 2009; after this date, there has been no housing available for any graduate students on the Coral Gables campus.</p>
<p>Miami previously had a series of seven buildings set aside for student residences called the Apartment Area, consisting of the oldest dormitories on campus which were originally built to house married veterans and their families. These buildings also featured fully furnished apartments with kitchen facilities, but were not leased to students as in the University Village. These residences were closed at the end of the Spring 2010 semester, although several others of these original dormitories continue to be used as office space for departments such as the Office of Student Employment, the <a>Air Force ROTC</a> Detachment 155, and the Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Education PIER 21.</p>
<p>The University of Miami does not offer housing for students with children or for married students. UM abolished its separate dorms for athletes in 1990. In 2006, UM opened the , 15-story Clinical Research Building and Wellness Center. In 2009, a <a>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) certified, nine-story Biomedical Research Building, a  laboratory and office facility, opened to house the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute and the Miami Institute for Human Genomics. UM has started to build a  UM Life Science Park adjacent to the UM medical campus. These additional  Gold LEED certified buildings are being built by Wexford Science &amp; Technology, a private developer, on land leased from UM.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2007, the University purchased the Cedars Medical Center, renaming it as the University of Miami Hospital. Situated in the Miami Health District, the hospital is close to the Jackson Memorial Hospital, which has been used by the UM students and faculty to provide patient care for many years.</p>
<p>Starting in 2004, the Miller School began offering instruction on the campus of <a>Florida Atlantic University</a> in <a>Boca Raton, Florida</a>. MD candidates are admitted to either the Miami or Boca Raton programs and spend all four years studying on the selected campus. In April 2005, the Boca Raton program was expanded into a full four year medical degree program.</p>
<p>There is no on campus housing for students of the Miller School of Medicine in Miami or Boca Raton.  The Miami and Boca Raton campuses charge identical tuition, with a lower tuition for in-state students.</p>
<h3>Virginia Key campus</h3>
<p> [[Image:Rosenstiel Applied Marine Physics Building.jpg|thumb|200px|The Applied Marine Physics Building at UM's [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]] on <a>Virginia Key</a>]] In 1945, construction began on the Rickenbacker Causeway to make Virginia Key accessible by car. The county offered to give UM a part of the island adjacent to the <a>Miami Seaquarium</a> in exchange for UM operating the aquarium. However, the aquarium construction was delayed when a bond referendum failed, so UM leased the land in 1951. In 1953, UM built classroom and lab buildings on a 16&nbsp;acre (65,000 m&#x00b2;) campus on <a>Virginia Key</a> in the City of Miami to house what became the <a>Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science</a>. Additional buildings were added in 1957, 1959 and 1965.</p>
<p>There is no housing on the Virginia Key campus. As part of its campus-wide free shuttle service, UM operates a route from the Coral Gables campus to the Virginia Key campus, which includes stops at the <a>Vizcaya</a> <a>Metrorail</a> station on weekdays.</p>
<h3>South Campus</h3>
<p> In 1946, UM acquired the former <a>Richmond Naval Air Station</a>, in southwestern Miami, located  south of the main campus in order to accommodate the post-war increase in students. Its six buildings provide  to currently house: the Global Public Health Research Group, Miami Institute for Human <a>Genomics</a>, Forensic Toxicology Laboratory (for analysis of Driving Under the Influence (D.U.I.) motorist blood samples), and <a>Microbiology</a> and <a>Immunology</a>. The campus was acquired immediately following World War II to accommodate about 1,100 students (mostly freshmen) with  housing, dining and recreational facilities and classrooms for two academic years. From 1948 to present it has been used as a research facility and storage area.  In the 1960s, some of the buildings were leased to the <a>Central Intelligence Agency</a>. The South Campus Grove was a  plot for agricultural research and horticultural studies that was established in 1948.</p>
<p>The Richmond campus is a  site near South Campus that was formerly the <a>United States Naval Observatory</a> Secondary National Time Standard Facility, which already had buildings and a 20M antenna used for <a>Very Long Baseline Interferometry</a> (VLBI). The Rosenstiel School&#x2019;s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS) and Richmond Satellite Operations Center (RSOC) have research facilities located on a portion of the new campus.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Since 2005, UM has a &quot;Green U&quot; initiative which includes LEED certification for buildings and the use of biofuels by the campus bus fleet. UM established the <a>Abess</a> Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy. As a part of the Abess Center, UM launched the R.J. Dunlap Marine Conservation Program to educate students on the importance of protecting the marine environment. In 2008, UM replaced the chiller plant on its Virginia Key campus to improve its carbon footprint. UM is also planting Mangroves, sea grape trees, and other dune plants on Virginia Key to protect its sand dunes and to protect the campus from storm damage. UM received a &quot;C+&quot; grade on the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card  and a &quot;B-&quot; for 2010 for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>  There were 21,845 applications for the fall 2009 freshman class, with 9,700 accepted and 2,006 enrolled. The 2009 freshman class came from: 39% Florida (with 18% Dade County and 7% Broward County); 49% outside Florida in the United States, and 12% foreign students.
