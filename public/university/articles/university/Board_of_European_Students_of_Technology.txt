<p><strong>Board of European Students of Technology</strong> (BEST) is an international, non-governmental, non-political, non-profit students organisation comprising 89 Local BEST Groups (LBGs) in 30 countries around Europe with more than 2000 active members.</p>
<p>BEST strives for empowered diversity by developing students of technology through complementary education, career support and involvement of the European learning system. By creating the opportunities for students to meet and learn from one another through academic, non-academic events and educational symposiums, BEST endeavors the development of a more internationally open minded conscience, encouraging their mobility and intercultural relationship and communication.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>The main events organized by BEST are BEST courses, Events on Education, Leisure Events and Job Fairs. </p>
<p>BEST Courses are the core activity of BEST and they can either be Courses on Technology, Courses on Career or BEST Engineering Competitions. These are events about one to two weeks in length, uniting technology students from all over Europe to study a technological subject. However, while these subjects are of an attractive and innovative nature, mixing various topics in engineering education, education on itself is not the only goal of these events: Equally important are expanding horizons, improving cultural understanding and in general providing European students of technology with the opportunity to experience something unique  for little cost.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The quality and openness of BEST Courses are important, as they distinguish BEST from other international student organisations. Any student from sciences and technology universities with a Local BEST Group (LBG) can apply to any of the before mentioned BEST activities, without having to become a BEST member. Thus, BEST provides a service not only to its members, but to all engineering students from associated universities. Furthermore, BEST has an internal quality standard that the courses are required to fulfil . In a Course, participants will have all food, lodging, travel costs during the course, cultural activities and an exciting academic program supplied during the course. Almost every BEST group organizes such a course every year.</p>
<p>Another important type of BEST event is the Engineering Competition (BEC). These are events organised in collaboration with a number of important European companies in the field of technology. The companies propose a problem to be solved by teams made of participating students. The competition events usually begin with training sessions, followed by several rounds of competition. Thus, students have the opportunity to consolidate their engineering capacities. The BEC concept has been conceived in order to complete the theoretical part of university studies with a practical one. Therefore, students will be able to increase their knowledge and get used to constructive thinking, as well as a different vision of a problem. Since 2009, the local engineering competitions (LEC) are brought together in a common project where winners from these competitions compete at the Regional and National level and then the winners go to the European final which is called <a>EBEC</a></p>
<h3>Student representation</h3>
<p>BEST also represents its students in some thematic networks. For example Sputnic, VM-Base, TREE and EIE-Surveyor. BEST is member of the following organisations in volved in Engineering education: <a>SEFI</a>, EFEES and <a>FEANI</a>.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>Board</h3>
<p>The <strong>Board</strong> is constituted by six members elected once per year at the General Assembly. The Board includes the following positions:</p>

</ul>
<h3>International Committees</h3>
<p>BEST has six committees that take care of specific tasks, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Educational Committee (EduCo): working on relations with institutions regarding education in Europe and supervising the symposia on education</li>
  <li>External Events Committee (EEC): supervising the organisation of external events of BEST, like Season Courses or Competitions</li>
  <li>Financial Team (finTeam): setting up cooperation with companies and other institutions</li>
  <li>Information Technology Committee (ITC): in charge of all computer-related aspects, including website</li>
  <li>Marketing Committee (markeTeam): creates and improves marketing of BEST</li>
  <li>Training Group (TiGro): takes care of internal training in BEST</li>
</ul>
<h3>BEST groups</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Map of Europe with BEST groups</a> A BEST Group is an association of BEST members at the same university. These groups are responsible for promoting and organising the activities of BEST at their <a>university</a>.</p>
<p>BEST is present in 30 countries at the following universities:</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Note that there are some universities commented out. These are observer groups of BEST which apply for membership. As they aren't official members yet, they aren't listed as such. --&gt; </p>
<h2>Partner organisations</h2>
<p>BEST collaborates with two other student organisations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>bonding-studenteninitiative e.V.</a> (from Germany, since 1997)</li>
  <li><a>Canadian Federation of Engineering students</a> (from Canada, since 2004)</li>
</ul>
