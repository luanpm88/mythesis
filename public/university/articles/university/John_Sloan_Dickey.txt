<p> <strong>John Sloan Dickey</strong> (November 4, 1907 &ndash; February 9, 1991) was an American diplomat, scholar, and intellectual. Dickey served as President of <a>Dartmouth College</a>, <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, from 1945 to 1970, and helped revitalize the <a>Ivy League</a> institution.</p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Dickey, born in <a>Lock Haven, Pennsylvania</a>, completed his <a>undergraduate</a> degree at Dartmouth in 1929 and later graduated from <a>Harvard Law School</a>. Dickey had a varied career: partner at a major Boston law firm, special assistant to the <a>Assistant Secretary of State</a> and later to the <a>Secretary of State</a>, a member of the <a>Office of Inter-American Affairs</a> and the division of <a>World Trade Intelligence</a>, and Director of the State Department's <a>Office of Public Affairs</a>. In 1945, he became President of Dartmouth College. &quot;Even after he assumed office in 1945 he was a principal actor in public policy, serving on President <a>Truman</a>'s 1947 Committee on Civil Rights, the <a>United Nations</a> Collective Measures Committee in 1951, and as consultant to Secretary of State <a>Acheson</a> on disarmament.&quot;[<a>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/features/succession/dickey.html</a>]</p>
<h2>Dartmouth presidency</h2>
<p>Regularly welcoming freshmen at Convocation with the phrase &quot;your business here is learning,&quot; John Sloan Dickey was committed to making Dartmouth the best liberal arts college in the country.  </p>
<p>John Sloan Dickey's commitment to the <a>liberal arts</a>, or, as he termed them &quot;the liberating arts,&quot; was perhaps best expressed in an innovative course on &quot;Great Issues,&quot; designed to introduce seniors to the problems of national and international relations they would face as citizens. President Dickey also reintroduced doctoral programs to Dartmouth, as well as a Northern Studies program and a Russian Civilization department. Dickey sought to expand the horizons of Dartmouth beyond Hanover and introduced foreign studies programs, a public affairs internship, and various social action programs. The <a>William Jewett Tucker Foundation</a> was opened by President Dickey, offering students opportunity and academic credit for social activism.</p>
<p>During his 25-year tenure, President Dickey headed two capital campaigns, doubled African American student enrollment, reinvigorated <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>, built the <a>Hopkins Center</a> and instituted continuing education for alumni. Consistent with his concern for, awareness of, and involvement in the great movements of the time, he saw the emerging importance of <a>computers</a>--a field then in its infancy--and built the <a>Kiewit Computation Center</a> in 1966. After stepping down as president, he continued his affiliation with the College by teaching Canadian-American relations as the Bicentennial Professor of Public Affairs. <a>Posted with permission from Dartmouth College</a></p>
<p>In 1982, the <a>John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding</a> was opened at Dartmouth to honor Dickey's legacy and &quot;coordinate, sustain, and enrich the international dimension of liberal arts education at Dartmouth.&quot;[<a>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dickey/jsd_center.html</a>]</p>
