<p> <strong>Beneficence</strong> is a bronze statue on the campus of <a>Ball State University</a>, located in <a>Muncie, Indiana</a>. It is referred to as &quot;Benny&quot; by the students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1930, a small group of men decided to establish a permanent symbol of <a>Muncie</a> and <a>Ball State University</a>'s gratitude for the <a>Ball family</a>'s extensive generosity.</p>
<p>This group commissioned renowned <a>sculptor</a> <a>Daniel Chester French</a>, who sculpted the statue of Lincoln in the <a>Lincoln Memorial</a> in Washington D.C., and named it Beneficence which he felt aptly described the feelings of the community and the actions of the Ball brothers. Finally erected in the midst of the <a>Great Depression</a>, Beneficence has become a chief icon of the University, and it symbolizes the selflessness of the Ball family in their affection for the community.  The statue is so entwined in the university's culture that it has become part of the school seal.</p>
<p>Beneficence's hand stretches out to welcome new students to campus.  The treasure box she holds in her other arm represents the treasure education can offer.  Her wings represent the flight into the world that take place when students graduate. The five pillars behind the statue represent the Ball Brothers, for whom the university is named.</p>
<p>Beneficence has a sister statue located in the Boston Gardens Park in <a>Boston, Massachusetts</a>, which holds a dish instead of a box.</p>
<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>Students on campus have been said to believe that if you sit at Beneficence's steps and kiss your true love, Benny's wings will flap, only if the eyes of the students are closed. Another myth is that the 5 urns above the pillars hold the Ball Brother's ashes, which is proven incorrect because they are buried in Beech Grove Cemetery. A third myth is that if a virgin ever graduated from Ball State, so the legend goes, the statue of Beneficence would lose its wings. As of this writing, the wings are still firmly in place.</p>
