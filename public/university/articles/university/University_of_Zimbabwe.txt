<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Zimbabwe (UZ)</strong> in <a>Harare</a>, is the oldest and largest <a>university</a> in <a>Zimbabwe</a>. UZ has declined and was closed for much of 2008. In addition to the academic buildings, the main campus is host to sporting facilities, all but two student residences and much of the staff housing. The College Green, located centrally to the academic buildings, is a popular site for social events. About one third of the campus is a seasonal <a>wetland</a>, unsuitable for construction and thus unused. </p>
<p>The major satellite campus is the Medical School campus at <a>Parirenyatwa Hospital</a> in central Harare. and the <a>University of Zimbabwe Lake Kariba Research Station</a> in the Nyamhunga suburb of <a>Kariba</a>. Several of Zimbabwe's universities started as colleges and satellite campuses of UZ, including <a>Bindura University of Science Education</a> and <a>Chinhoyi University of Technology</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:Uzcouncilroom.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Council room of the University of Zimbabwe. Portraits of former Vice-Chancellors from left to right: [[Robert Craig (theologian)|Robert Craig]], <a>Leonard Lewis</a>, <a>Walter Kamba</a> and <a>Gordon Chavunduka</a>.]] In 1945, Manfred Hodson (after whom a <a>residence</a> is now named) formed the <em>Rhodesia University Association</em>, inspired by the promise of &#x00a3;20,000 by J.F. Kapnek for establishing such a university.  Independent of the initiatives of Hodson and the Legislative Assembly, the Central African Council's commission on higher education, led by <a>Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders</a> (after whom another <a>residence</a> is now named) recommended the establishment of a university college to serve Rhodesia and Nyasaland, with its first preference being to integrate with the Southern Rhodesian initiative. and in 1982 the Royal Charter was replaced by an Act of Parliament. The late 1980s and most of the 1990s saw a rise in <a>student protest</a>, resulting in several closures  and mass explusions. Despite the ongoing tensions, the university continued to grow and the student population had reached 8,000 by 1995 Many donors, including the <a>Government of Sweden</a>, which had previously been a major financer of UZ, cut or cancelled their aid. As the <a>economic crisis</a> grew in Zimbabwe, UZ began to fail to recruit lecturers and professors to fill vacancies. By 2007, the shortage of staff was preventing the teaching and examination of some programmes. Problems with water and electricity supply, as well as maintenance of infrastructure became critical by the late 2000s. The University briefly opened in early 2009, but no classes were held due to strike action by lecturers. The institution was closed again in late February, following demonstrations by students against new, hard currency fees.</p>
<h2>Ranking</h2>
<p>Although UZ has not generally featured in major international rankings such as the <a>Times Higher Education Supplement QS World University Rankings</a> or the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, the World Universities Ranking placed the university number 14 in Africa in 2007, after various South African universities, the <a>American University in Cairo</a> and the <a>University of Dar-es-Salaam</a>, and number 3,549 out of 9,760 accredited universities in the world. By 2008, UZ had slid to number 17 in Africa and number 4,001 globally.</p>

<p>[[File:2004 uz iwrm.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Postgraduate [[water resources]] students in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Zimbabwe, with their <a>professor</a>s and <a>lecturer</a>s.]] The University of Zimbabwe offers postgraduate honours degrees, two types of masters degree and doctoral degrees. Postgraduate honours programmes, also known as <em>special honours</em> programmes last are for one year duration and incorporate coursework, examinations and a compulsory project module. Masters degrees by coursework and project are designated M.A. or M.Sc. and are of one to two years duration. They incorporate coursework and project modules. Masters degrees by research thesis only are designated M.Phil. and require a minimum of two years study. The doctoral programme, D.Phil., is by research thesis only. Students who are carrying out an M.Phil. study, but have not yet submitted their thesis, may apply to their faculty to upgrade their study to the D.Phil. programme.</p>
<h3>Suspension of programmes</h3>
<p>Due to the heavy staff vacancies that UZ began suffering from in the 2000s, many programmes and specialisations have been suspended. <a>Sport</a> at UZ is centred around the Sports Pavilion, which was built with a donation from Rhodesia (now National) Breweries. Sports offered at the university include <a>athletics</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>cricket</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>hockey</a>, <a>rugby</a> and <a>tennis</a>. UZ has frequently won the Zimbabwe Universities Sports Association Games. The University of Zimbabwe Football Club plays in Zimbabwe's Division One and is the former home of <a>Manchester City</a> <a>striker</a> and <a>Zimbabwe national football team</a> captain, <a>Benjani Mwaruwari</a>. The club was for a time coached by former <a>President</a> <a>Canaan Banana</a>. When Zimbabwe hosted the <a>All-Africa Games</a> in 1995, UZ was the games village. Maintenance of sporting facilities is the responsibility of the Director: Sport, but in recent years accessing funds from the State Procurement Board has been a challenge. and the <a>AIESEC</a> and Students Institution for Success Club. In 2005, UZ won the <a>Students in Free Enterprise</a> World Cup held in Ontario, Canada. There are also non&ndash;academic clubs such as <a>Rotaract</a></p>
<h3>Gender issues</h3>
<p>The gender gap in enrollment at UZ, like at African universities, became a concern by the mid-1990s and in 1995 an affirmative action programme was built into the university's policy. However, many female students feel inhibited from taking male-dominated courses or taking part in student politics. Women are intimidated by gender&ndash;related violence</p>
