The 2010 yearbook marked its 87th volume. The book is primarily made for senior students, but can be purchased by any Rider student. Seniors that sit for a portrait receive a yearbook free of charge. The book typically is shipped to students in November. As of 2010, <a>Herff Jones</a> publishes the book for Rider.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Student population</h2>
<p>There are 5,982 undergraduate and graduate students attending.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Athletics logo</a>   Athletic teams are nicknamed the Broncs. The school competes in the <a>Division I</a> <a>Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The intercollegiate sports program at Rider was started by coach <a>Clair Bee</a> in the 1920s. Two of the school's most famous athletic alumni are former <a>Notre Dame</a> basketball coach and current <a>ESPN</a> sportscaster <a>Digger Phelps</a>, who played basketball at Rider from 1959 to 1963 and <a>Jason Thompson</a> who played basketball at Rider from 2004 to 2008 and was drafted by the <a>Sacramento Kings</a> with the 12th pick of the 2008 NBA Draft while never winning a MAAC championship or appearing in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>The university competed in <a>football</a> until 1951, when the university was placed under investigation after allegations of paying recruits, as well as improper benefits for players on the team. The NCAA asked the school to discontinue the football program, and the Broncs have not fielded a team since. Rider students often proclaim their football team &quot;undefeated since 1951,&quot; as they have not existed since that time.</p>
<p>As of January 20, 2007, there are 78 members in the Rider University Athletics <a>Hall of Fame</a>. The University has recently redesigned their sports logo. [<a>http://comm.rider.edu/ridernews/html/sections/2006_2007/15_02_23_07/news/03_newsstory.html</a>]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the conclusion of the Civil War Henry B. Bryant and Henry D. Stratton, operators of a chain of business schools decided to open a school in New Jersey. On October 1, 1865, The Trenton Business College, located in Temperance Hall at the corner of South Broad and Front Streets, was established. Andrew Jackson Rider became its first president. President Rider was also known as a leading force in the Cranberry Industry, as he owned 500 acres of cranberry bogs near Hammonton New Jersey.</p>
<p>President Rider steered the business school through a period of growth, and the school continued to move to larger quarters. In 1896 women were admitted to the school and in 1897 the school was renamed The Rider Business College. President Rider stepped down the following year. In 1957 Rider introduced liberal studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 2007 President Rozanski announced the creation of the School of Fine and Performing Arts to integrate the Lawrenceville and Princeton campuses and expand programming for the arts.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments</h3>
<p>Rider has invested more than $90 million since 2004 to construct new and renovate existing facilities for teaching, performing arts, residences and recreation. In 2005 Rider completed its  Student Recreation Center (SRC), a new 186 bed Residence Hall and three-story additions to Ziegler and Hill Residence Halls visually symbolizing the renewal taking place on both campuses. It contains an indoor track, pool tables, and about 30 workout machines, 10 with built-in TVs.  The opening of the SRC by President Rozanski, the mascot of Rider University - the Rider Bronc, and Student Government Association (SGA) President Perry Whiteley was, as SGA President Perry Whiteley said, the result of President Rozanski's creation of a &quot;contagious and engulfing sense of excitement and pride&#x201d; among current and prospective students and alumni. &#x201c;It has given students more options for working out and participating in sports and has established a new hub for student life,&#x201d; he said &#x201c;It is difficult to quantitatively capture the true scope of excitement and pride that has engulfed the campus community in anticipation of the opening of this new facility.&#x201d;</p>
<p>In 2006 Marion Buckelew Cullen, a former Westminster Choir College trustee contributed a planned gift of $5 million towards the creation of a new academic complex on the Princeton campus which will contain a new academic building, with two story performance and rehearsal halls, classrooms, study areas and a Playhouse renovation. During the spring 2008 semester Rider University President Mordechai Rozanski announced several facilities enhancements and renovations including the construction of new residence halls, renovations of faculty offices, classrooms, and laboratories, as well as new studios, classroom technology upgrades, practice rooms, a new graphic design studio in Fine Arts, and renovations of the Daly's Dining Hall. President Rozanski also announced new academic programs and new financial aid resources that will help students be able to afford to attend Rider.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2009, construction was completed on a new, environmentally-friendly 150-bed residence hall on the Lawrenceville campus, and more than 300 new parking spaces. In the summer of 2010 the University began two construction projects, a new, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-silver certified,  academic building to be built next to Moore Library, and an  expansion of the Bart Luedeke Center Theater, that will include dressing rooms, an orchestra pit, black box theater and a dance studio. Both are scheduled to be completed by the Fall 2011 semester. A new turf field for the soccer, intramural, club sports and field hockey teams made its debut in September 2010.</p>
<h2>President</h2>
<p>Its current President is Dr. <a>Mordechai Rozanski</a>, who is Rider's sixth president. Dr. Rozanski became President on August 1, 2003 following the retirement of former President, Dr. <a>J. Barton Luedeke</a>.</p>
<p>Rider has had six presidents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Andrew Jackson Rider (1866&#x2013;1898)</li>
  <li>Franklin Benjamin Moore (1898&#x2013;1934)</li>
