<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> (informally <strong>Birmingham University</strong>, or simply <strong>Birmingham</strong>) is a <a>British</a> <a>Redbrick</a> <a>university</a> located in the city of <a>Birmingham</a>, <a>England</a>. Founded in <a>Edgbaston</a> in 1900 as a successor to <a>Mason Science College</a>, and with origins dating back to the 1825 <a>Birmingham Medical School</a>, it was the first Redbrick university to gain an official <a>royal charter</a>.</p>
<p>It is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of research universities and a founding member of <a>Universitas 21</a>. The student population includes around 16,500 <a>undergraduate</a> and 8,000 <a>postgraduate</a> students, making it the largest university in the <a>West Midlands region</a>, and the 11th largest in the UK. As of 2006-07 it is the fourth most popular English university by number of applications. The annual income of the institution for 2007-08 was <a>&#x00a3;</a>411.6&nbsp;million, with an expenditure of &#x00a3;393.2&nbsp;million. Birmingham has the ninth largest financial endowment of any British university at approximately &#x00a3;85&nbsp;million in 2009.</p>
<p>Described as &quot;Large, prestigious and rather grand&quot; by <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> newspaper, the university is ranked nationally between 10th (<a>The Times HES</a>), and internationally between 59th (<a>QS</a>; <a>The Times HES</a>) and 99th (<a>ARWU</a>) in the latest respective rankings. The <a>Sunday Times</a>' composite ranking placed the university 19th from 1998-2007. Birmingham was ranked 12th in the UK in the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, the best result in the <a>West Midlands region</a>, with 16 per cent of the university's research regarded as 'world-leading' and a further 41 per cent as 'internationally excellent', and particular strengths in the fields of music, physics, biosciences, computer science, mechanical engineering, European studies, political science, international relations and law. Birmingham's sport activities have been consistently ranked within the top three in <a>British Universities competitions</a> for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>The University is home to the <a>Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a>, housing works by <a>Van Gogh</a>, <a>Picasso</a> and <a>Monet</a>, the <a>Lapworth Museum of Geology</a>, and the <a>Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower</a>, which is a prominent landmark visible from many parts of the city, and the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world. <a>Alumni</a> include former British Prime Minister <a>Neville Chamberlain</a> and 8 <a>Nobel laureates</a>.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>[[File:BirminghamUniversityChancellorsCourt.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Aston Webb]] building, Chancellor's Court]] The main campus of the university occupies a site some  south-west of Birmingham city centre, in <a>Edgbaston</a>. It is arranged around <a>Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower</a> (affectionately known as 'Old Joe'), a grand <a>campanile</a> which commemorates the university's first chancellor, <a>Joseph Chamberlain</a>. The university's Great Hall is located in the domed <a>Aston Webb</a> Building, which is named after one of the architects - the other was <a>Ingress Bell</a>. The initial  site was given to the university in 1900 by Lord Calthorpe. The grand buildings were an outcome of the &#x00a3;50,000 given by steel magnate and philanthropist <a>Andrew Carnegie</a> to establish a &quot;first class modern scientific college&quot; on the model of the <a>Ivy League</a> <a>Cornell University</a> in the <a>United States</a>. Funding was also provided by Sir <a>Charles Holcroft</a>.</p>
<p>The original domed buildings, built in Accrington red brick, semicircle to form Chancellor's Court. This sits on a  drop, so the architects placed their buildings on two tiers with a  drop between them. The clock tower stands in the centre of the Court.</p>
<p>[[File:old joe.jpg|thumb|190px|upright|left|[[Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower|'Old Joe']]]]</p>
<p>The campanile itself draws its inspiration from the <a>Torre del Mangia</a>, a medieval clock tower that forms part of the <a>Town Hall</a> in <a>Siena</a>, <a>Italy</a>. When it was built, it was described as 'the intellectual beacon of the Midlands' by the <em>Birmingham Post</em>. The clock tower was Birmingham's tallest building from the date of its construction in 1908 until 1969; it is now the third highest in the city. It is one of the top 50 tallest buildings in the UK, and the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world,</p>
<p>The campus has a wide diversity in architectural types and architects. &quot;What makes Birmingham so exceptional among the Red Brick universities is the deployment of so many other major Modernist practices: only Oxford and Cambridge boast greater selections&quot;.  The Guild of Students original section facing King Edward School was designed by Birmingham inter-war architect <a>Holland Hobbiss</a> who also designed the King Edward school opposite. It was described as &quot;Redbrick Tudorish&quot; by <a>Nikolaus Pevsner</a>.</p>
<p>The statue on horseback fronting the entrance to the university and <a>Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a> is a 1722 statue of <a>George I</a> rescued from Dublin in 1937.  This was saved by Bodkin, a director of the National Gallery of Ireland and first director of the Barber Institute.  The statue was commissioned by the <a>Dublin Corporation</a> from the Flemish sculptor <a>John van Nost</a>.</p>
<p>Final negotiations for part of what is now the Vale were only completed in March 1947.  By then, properties which would have their names used for halls of residences such as Wyddrington and Maple Bank were under discussion and more land was obtained from the Calthorpe estate in 1948 and 1949 providing the setting for the Vale.  Construction on the Vale started in 1962 with the creation of a  artificial lake and the building of Ridge, High, Wyddrington and Lake Halls. The first, Ridge Hall, opened for 139 women in January 1964, with its counterpart High Hall (now Chamberlain Hall) admitting its first male residents the following October.</p>
<h4>1960s and modern expansion</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|The university's Learning Centre (left) , School of Computer Science (right) and Faraday sculpture</a> The university underwent a major expansion in the 1960s due to the production of a masterplan by Casson, Conder and Partners. The first of the major buildings to be constructed to a design by the firm was the Refectory and Staff House which was built in 1961 and 1962. The two buildings are connected by a bridge. The next major buildings to be constructed were the Wyddrington and Lake Halls and the Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, all completed in 1965.  The Wyddrington and Lake Halls, on Edgbaston Park Road, were designed by H. T. Cadbury-Brown and contain three floors of student dwellings above a single floor of communal facilities.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, now known as the Ashley Building, was designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey <a>whorl</a>. The two-storey block follows the curve of the road, and has load-bearing brick cross walls. It is faced in specially-made concrete blocks. The spiral is faced with faceted pre-cast concrete cladding panels. It was <a>statutorily listed</a> in 1993</p>
<p>Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were commissioned to design the Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is the roof of the changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2&#x00bd;-inch think sprayed concrete shells springing from  long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a <a>cantilever</a>ed canopy. <a>thumb|left|upright|The Muirhead Tower, originally constructed in 1969, showing the fascia and extensive refurbishment finished in 2009</a></p>
<p>Also completed in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, which was designed by <a>Philip Dowson</a> of <a>Arup Associates</a>. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 <a>RIBA</a> Architecture Award for the West Midlands. Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of a quarter of a million pounds.</p>
<p>In 1967 Lucas House, a new hall of residence designed by <a>The John Madin Design Group</a>, was completed, providing 150 study bedrooms. It was constructed in the garden of a large house. The Medical School was extended in 1967 to a design by Leonard J. Multon and Partners. The two-storey building was part of a complex which covers the southside of <a>Metchley Fort</a>, a Roman fort. In 1968, the Institute for Education in the Department for Education was opened. This was another Casson, Conder and Partners-designed building. The complex consisted of a group of buildings centred around an eight-storey block, containing study offices, laboratories and teaching rooms. The building has a reinforced concrete frame which is exposed internally and the external walls are of silver-grey rustic bricks. The roofs of the lecture halls, penthouse and Child Study wing are covered in copper. The name, Muirhead Tower, came from that of the first philosophy professor of the University <a>John Henry Muirhead</a>.</p>
<p>Currently in development is a 450-seat concert hall to complete the redbrick semi-circle of the Aston Webb building. This auditorium, with its associated research, teaching and rehearsal facilities, will house the Department of Music.</p>
<h4>Other features</h4>
<p><a>thumb|upright|University railway station</a> In 1973, <a>University (Birmingham) railway station</a>, on the <a>Cross-City Line</a>, was opened to serve the university and its hospital. It is the only university campus in Britain with its own railway station.</p>
<p>Located within the Edgbaston site of the university is the <a>Winterbourne Botanic Garden</a>, a 24,000 square metre (258,000 square foot) <a>Edwardian</a> <a>Arts and crafts</a> style garden. There has been much recent development on the western part of the campus. There are new academic buildings, including a learning resource centre and Computer Science department. The massive statue in the foreground was a gift to the University by its sculptor Sir Edward Paolozzi - the sculpture is named 'Faraday', and has an excerpt from the poem 'The Dry Salvages' by <a>T. S. Eliot</a> around its base.</p>
<p>The University of Birmingham operates the <a>Lapworth Museum of Geology</a> in the Aston Webb Building in <a>Edgbaston</a>. It is named after <a>Charles Lapworth</a>, a geologist who worked at Mason Science College. Since November 2007, the university has been holding a <a>farmers' market</a> on the campus. Birmingham is the first university in the country to have an accredited farmers' market.</p>
<p>The considerable extent of the estate meant that by the end of the 1990s it was valued at &#x00a3;536&nbsp;million.</p>
<h3>Selly Oak campus</h3>
<p>The university's <a>Selly Oak</a> campus is a short distance to the south of the main campus. It was the home of a federation of nine higher education colleges, mainly focused on theology and education, which were integrated into the university for teaching in 1999. Among these was Westhill College (later the University of Birmingham, Westhill), which merged with the University's School of Education in 2001. The UK <a>daytime television</a> show <em><a>Doctors</a></em> is filmed on this campus. The University also has buildings at several other sites in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Birmingham Medical School and Mason Science College</h3>
<p><a>thumb|A view across Chancellor's Court, towards the Law building</a> Although the earliest beginnings of the University were previously traced back to the <a>Birmingham Medical School</a> which is linked to <a>William Sands Cox</a> in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the London medical schools. Further research has now revealed the roots of the <a>Birmingham Medical School</a> in the medical education seminars of Mr <a>John Tomlinson</a> the first surgeon to the <a>Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary</a>, and later to the General Hospital. These classes were the first ever held outside London or south of the Scottish border in the winter of 1767-68. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical and surgical apprentices at the General Hospital, opened in 1779. The medical school which grew out of the <a>Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary</a> was founded in 1828 but Cox began teaching in December 1825. Queen Victoria granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled &quot;The Queen's Hospital&quot;. It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen's College. The heritage archives of the Univeirsty of Birmingham are accessible for research through the University's <a>Special Collections</a>.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>[[File:BirminghamBarberInstitute.jpg|thumb|The [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]]]] In 1939, the <a>Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a>, designed by <a>Robert Atkinson</a>, was opened. In 1956, the first MSc programme in <a>Geotechnical Engineering</a> commenced under the title of &quot;Foundation Engineering&quot;, and has been run annually at the University of Birmingham since. It was the first geotechnical post-graduate school in England. The UK's longest-running MSc programme in Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors also started at the University of Birmingham in 1956, the same year that the world's first commercial nuclear power station was opened at Calder Hall in Cumbria. In 1957, Sir <a>Hugh Casson</a> and <a>Neville Conder</a> were asked by the university to prepare a masterplan on the site of the original 1900 buildings which were incomplete. The university drafted in other architects to amend the masterplan produced by the group. During the 1960s, the university constructed numerous large buildings, expanding the campus. The initial plan was for a university college in <a>Coventry</a> attached to Birmingham but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>The university has been involved in many important inventions and developments in science. The <a>cavity magnetron</a> was developed at the university in the Physics Department by <a>John Randall</a>, <a>Harry Boot</a> and <a>James Sayers</a>. This was vital to the Allied victory in <a>World War II</a>. In 1940, the <a>Frisch-Peierls memorandum</a>, a document which demonstrated that the <a>atomic bomb</a> was more than simply theoretically possible, was written in the Physics Department. The university also hosted early work on <a>Gaseous diffusion</a> in the Chemistry department when it was located in the Hills building. Many windows in the Aston Webb building overlooking the former fume cupboards were opaque from being attacked by <a>hydrofluoric acid</a> well into recent years.</p>
<p>In 1943, <a>Mark Oliphant</a> made an early proposal for the construction of a proton-<a>synchrotron</a>, however he made no assurance that the machine would work. When phase stability was discovered in 1945, the proposal was resurrected and construction of a machine at the university that could surpass 1<a>GeV</a>. The university was aiming to construct the first machine to do this, however, funds were short and the machine did not start until 1953. They were beaten by the <a>Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>, who managed to start their <a>Cosmotron</a> in 1952, and get it fully working in 1953, before the University of Birmingham.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>The discipline of <a>cultural studies</a> was founded at the University of Birmingham. Between 1964 and 2002, the campus was home to the <a>Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies</a>, a leading research centre whose members' work came to be known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies. Despite being established by one of the key figures in the field, <a>Richard Hoggart</a>, and being later directed by the renowned theorist <a>Stuart Hall</a>, the department was controversially closed down.</p>
<p>The <a>final round</a> of the first ever <a>televised leaders' debates</a>, hosted by the <a>BBC</a>, was held at the university during the <a>2010 British general election</a> campaign on the 29 April 2010. It will also act as a training camp for the <a>Jamaica</a>n <a>track and field</a> team prior to the <a>2012 London Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>On 9 August 2010 the University announced that for the first time it would not enter the <a>UCAS</a> <a>clearing</a> process for 2010 admission, which matches under-subscribed courses to students who did not meet their firm or insurance choices, due to all places being taken. Largely a result of the <a>Financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;2010</a>, Birmingham joins fellow Russell Group universities including Oxbridge, Edinburgh and Bristol in not offering any clearing places.</p>
<h2>Chancellors</h2>
<p>Birmingham has had six <a>Chancellors</a> since gaining its royal charter in 1900. The current Vice-Chancellor is Professor <a>David Eastwood</a>. The first Chancellor of Birmingham was <a>Joseph Chamberlain</a>, he was the first commoner in 240 years to hold the post of Chancellor of a British university, and the first such chancellor ever not to have been a member of the <a>Established Church</a>.</p>

Special Collections has a large number of pre-1850 books dating from 1471 with approximately 3 million manuscripts. Special Collections also contains the Chamberlain collection of papers from <a>Neville Chamberlain</a>, <a>Joseph Chamberlain</a> and <a>Austen Chamberlain</a>, the Avon Papers belonging to <a>Antony Eden</a> with material on the <a>Suez Crisis</a>, the Cadbury Papers relating to the <a>Cadbury</a> firm from 1900 to 1960, the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern Manuscripts of <a>Alphonse Mingana</a>, the <a>Noel Coward</a> Collection, the papers of Edward Elgar, <a>Oswald Mosley</a>, and <a>David Lodge</a>, and the records of the English <a>YMCA</a> and of the <a>Church Missionary Society</a>. The university's Library Services department operates 10 libraries across the Edgbaston campus, Selly Oak campus, Birmingham City Centre and Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<h3>NHS hospitals</h3>
<p>[[File:BirminghamQueenElizabethHospitalMedicalSchool.jpg|thumb|upright|Right|The [[University of Birmingham Medical School|Medical School]] and <a>Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a>]] The University of Birmingham's medical school is one of the largest in Europe with well over 450 medical students being trained in each of the clinical years and over 1,000 teaching, research, technical and administrative staff. The school has centres of excellence in cancer, immunology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience and endocrinology and renowned nationally and internationally for its research and developments in these fields. The medical school has close links with the <a>NHS</a> and works closely with 15 teaching hospitals and 50 primary care training practices in the <a>West Midlands</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust</a> is the main teaching hospital in the West Midlands. It is very successful and has been given three stars for the past four consecutive years. The trust also hosts the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, based at <a>Selly Oak Hospital</a>, which provides medical support to military personnel such as military returned from fighting in the <a>Iraq War</a>.</p>
<h3>Off-campus establishments</h3>
<p>A number of the university's centres, schools and institutes are located away from its two campuses in Edgbaston and Selly Oak:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The School of Dentistry, in Birmingham City Centre</li>
  <li>The <a>Shakespeare Institute</a>, in <a>Stratford-upon-Avon</a></li>
  <li>The <a>Ironbridge Institute</a>, in <a>Telford</a>, which offers postgraduate and professional development courses in <a>heritage</a></li>
  <li>The Raymond Priestley Centre, near <a>Coniston</a> in the <a>Lake District</a>, which is used for <a>outdoor pursuits</a> and <a>field work</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>University of Birmingham Observatory</h4>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The University of Birmingham Astronomical Observatory</a> The University of Birmingham Observatory is used primarily for undergraduate teaching at the University of Birmingham. It has two main instruments, a 16&quot; <a>Cassegrain</a> (working at f/19) and a 14&#x201d; <a>Meade</a> LX200R (working at f/6.35). A third telescope is also present and is used exclusively for visual observations.</p>
<p>Undergraduates of the Physics &amp; Astrophysics programmes use the observatory in their 2nd and 3rd years. In the 2nd year they use this for prime focus imaging (e.g. light curve of an eclipsing binary, orbit of a comet) and in the 3rd year they use it for spectral analysis of celestial bodies (e.g. the wind speed of a P-Cygni star, the distance to a nearby Seyfert galaxy).</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>[[File:Birmingham Business School.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Birmingham Business School]]]] In August 2010, the University was ranked 10th in the UK and 59th best in the world by <em><a>QS World University Rankings</a></em>. The university is ranked 22nd in <em><a>The Times</a></em> 2010 <em>Good University Guide</em>, and 85th-87th by <a>Global University Ranking</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Owing to Birmingham's role as a centre of light engineering, the University traditionally had a special focus on science, engineering and commerce, as well as <a>coal mining</a>. It now teaches a full range of academic subjects and has five-star rating for teaching and research in several departments; additionally, it is widely regarded as making a prominent contribution to cancer studies, hosting the first <a>Cancer Research UK</a> Centre.</p>
<p>The University is particularly known for its research. In the 2001 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, two thirds of The University's departments ranked nationally or internationally outstanding. Languages, mathematics, biological sciences, physiotherapy, sociology and electrical and electronic engineering all recorded maximum points. The sociology department also ranked 4th by the Guardian University guide. According to the results of the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> 2008, 90% of the University of Birmingham&#x2019;s research activity has international impact. The Research Fortnight&#x2019;s University Power Ranking, based on quality and quantity of research activity, put the University of Birmingham 12th in the UK, leading the way across a broad range of disciplines including Primary Care, Cancer Studies, Psychology and Sport and Exercise Sciences.</p>
<p>As is the case with all of the '<a>redbrick</a>' civic institutions, the University of Birmingham holds a sizeable student body and teaches a comparatively broader range of courses than smaller institutions. After taking up his post as vice-chancellor in April 2009, <a>David Eastwood</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>When I was appointed, people described this university as a sleeping giant, and there is this feeling that although this is a great university, we could do even better. This is a university which can do yet more and I am here to play my part. That is the challenge, but it's not an easy challenge as we are competing in a global environment. We have some terrific, genuinely global leading research at this university, but we need to build on our research strengths and increase further the quality of our research and the impact of our research. Cancer research is as good here as anywhere, we have one of the best three psychology courses in the country, the best music departments and best sports science degrees in the country, and very good engineering. One of the great attractions of this university is that we have the breadth that other universities dream of, but it's fundamentally about building on our strengths.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>League table rankings</h3>
<p>In 2007, the Sunday Times released averages of all its tables over 10 years, ranking Birmingham as 19th in the country from 1998 - 2007.</p>
<p>The Times Higher Education Supplement - QS World University rankings put Birmingham at 10th in the United Kingdom in 2009.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Guild of Students</h3>
<p>[[File:BirminghamBUGS.jpg|thumb|Right|[[University of Birmingham Guild of Students]]]] The University of Birmingham Guild of Students is the university's <a>student union</a>. Originally the Guild of Undergraduates, the Institution had its first foundations in the <a>Mason Science College</a> in the centre of Birmingham around 1876. The University of Birmingham itself formally received its Royal Charter in 1900 with the Guild of Students being provided for as a Student Representative Council. It is not known for certain why the name 'Guild of Students' was chosen as opposed to 'Union of Students', however, the Guild shares its name with <a>Liverpool Guild of Students</a>, another <a>'redbrick university'</a>; both organisations subsequently founded the <a>National Union of Students</a>. The Union Building, the Guild's bricks and mortar presence, was designed by the architect <a>Holland W. Hobbiss</a>.</p>
<p>The Guild's official purposes are to represent its members and provide a means of socialising, though societies and general amenities. The university provides the Guild with the Union Building effectively rent free as well as a block grant to support student services. The Guild also runs several bars, eateries, social spaces and social events.</p>
<p>The Guild supports a variety of student societies and volunteering projects, roughly around 180 at any one time. The Guild complements these societies and volunteering projects with professional staffed services, including its walk-in Advice and Representation Centre (ARC), Student Development, Job Zone, Student Mentors in halls, and Community Wardens around <a>Bournbrook</a>. The Guild of Students was where the international volunteering charity <a>InterVol</a> was conceived and developed, initially as a student society. Another two of the Guild's long-standing societies are Student Advice and Nightline (previously Niteline), which both provide peer-to-peer welfare support.  The Guild was one of the first universities in the United Kingdom to publish a campus newspaper, <em><a>Redbrick</a></em>, supported financially by the Guild of Students and advertising revenue.</p>
<p>The Guild undertakes its representative function through its officer group, seven of whom are full time, on sabbatical from their studies, and ten of whom are part time and hold their positions whilst still studying. Elections are held yearly, conventionally February, for the following academic year. These officers have regular contact with the university's officer-holders and managers. In theory, the Guild's officers are directed and kept to account over their year in office by Guild Council, a 500 seat pseudo-legislature. The Guild also supports the university &quot;student reps&quot; scheme, which aims to provide an effective channel of feedback from students on more of a departmental level.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>The university provides housing for most first-year students, running a guarantee scheme for all those UK applicants who choose Birmingham as their firm UCAS choice. 90 per cent of university-provided housing is inhabited by first-year students.</p>
<p>The university has spent the last few years re-organising their accommodation offering. The university maintained gender-segregated halls until 1999 when Lake and Wyddrington &quot;halls&quot; (treated as two different halls, despite being physically one building) was reborn as Shackleton. University House was decommissioned as accommodation to house the expanding Business School, while Mason Hall has been demolished and rebuilt, opening in 2008. Shackleton is now the only hall providing catering, although other students are welcome to join its meal plan. In the summer of 2006, the university sold three of its most distant halls (Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close) to private operators, while later in the year and during term, the university was forced urgently to decommission both Chamberlain Tower and Manor House over fire safety inspection failures. The university has rebranded its halls offerings into three villages.</p>
<h4>Vale Village</h4>

Norwest Holst Ltd are the <a>contractor</a>s, and Couch Perry Wilkes are the services engineers, DTA are the <a>structural engineer</a>s, Faithful &amp; Gould are the <a>quantity surveyor</a>s and CDM Project Safety are the planning supervisors. The entire project is expected to cost &#x00a3;36.75&nbsp;million.</p>
<p>The largest student-run event at the university, and indeed possibly in the UK, is also held on the Vale. The <a>Vale Festival</a> is a large annual music festival, attracting crowds of over 5,000 and boasting over forty bands across five stages and a multitude of other activities and events. It raises over &#x00a3;30,000 a year for charities.</p>
<h4>Pritchatts Park Village</h4>
<p>The Pritchatts Park Village houses over 700 students both undergraduate and postgraduate students.  Halls include 'Ashcroft', 'The Spinney' and 'Oakley Court', as well as 'Pritchatts House' and the 'Pritchatts Road Houses' The Spinney is a small complex of six houses and twelve smaller flats, housing 104 students in total.

<h4>Selly Oak Village</h4>
<p>Selly Oak Village consists of three residences; Jarratt Hall, Douper Hall and Victoria Hall.

The village has 637 bed spaces for students. Douper Hall consists of 28 flats accommodating from two to six persons for 117 undergraduate and postgraduate students. Jarratt Hall is a large complex designed around a central courtyard and three landscaped areas. It houses a mixture of 620 undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p>
<h4>Non-university accommodation</h4>
<p>Until recently, the university had not been served by many private halls; a sole Victoria Halls was built in 2001. However, alongside the former university halls of Hunter Court, the Beeches and <a>Queens Hospital Close</a>, a number of other private halls aimed at the University of Birmingham market opened for business in 2007, such as Opal 1 on Bristol Road and IQFive on Bath Row near Five Ways.</p>
<p>A large number of students cohabit in rented houses, mainly in the <a>Bournbrook</a> area. However an increasingly large number of students are thought to be local, continuing to live in the family home.</p>
<h3>University Sport</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|One of the many university athletics fields</a> The university has many successful sports teams and has been consistently ranked in the top four of the <a>British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport</a> (BUCS) league table. The university's reputation for sport is a long-standing one; in 1954 it became the first UK university to offer a sports degree, and until 1968 exercise was compulsory for all students.</p>
<p>University of Birmingham Sport (UBS) offers a wide range of competitive and participation sports, which is utilised by the student and local population of Birmingham. Alongside fitness classes such as yoga and aerobics, UBS offers over 40 different sport teams, including <a>rowing</a>, <a>cricket</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>American football</a> (Birmingham Lions), <a>triathlon</a> and many more.  The wide selection has ensured the university has remained one of the country's most active and colourful campuses with over 2000 students participating in sport.</p>
<p>UBS offers over 40 scholarships and bursaries to national and international students of exceptional athletic ability.</p>
<p>The university sports centre was originally designed to have the swimming pool on stilts. The design had to be revised once it was realised that the structure would be unable to support the weight of water. The model of the university in the Great Hall shows the original design.</p>
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
<p><a>David Lodge</a>'s novel <em><a>Changing Places</a></em> tells the story of exchange of professors between the universities of <a>Rummidge</a> and Euphoric State, Plotinus, thinly disguised fictional versions of Birmingham and <a>UC Berkeley</a>, which in the book both have replicas of the <a>Leaning Tower of Pisa</a> on campus.</pre>
<p>The university campus has been used as a filming location for a number of film and television productions, particularly those of the <a>BBC</a> which has a presence at the university's <a>Selly Oak</a> campus, the <a>BBC Drama Village</a>. Scenes from the <a>John Cleese</a> film <em><a>Clockwise</a></em> were filmed at the campus' east entrance, while several episodes of the BBC detective series <em><a>Dalziel and Pascoe</a></em>, daytime soap <em><a>Doctors</a></em> and <a>CBBC</a> series <em><a>Brum</a></em> have been filmed in and around campus. Interior and exterior scenes for a BBC adaptation of Birmingham alumnus <a>David Lodge</a>'s novel <em><a>Nice Work</a></em> and BBC comedy drama <em><a>A Very Peculiar Practice</a></em> were also shot in and around the University campus and halls of residence with a number of students appearing as extras. A trailer for the BBC's <a>Red Nose Day 2007</a>, featuring <a>Lou and Andy</a> from <em><a>Little Britain</a></em>, was filmed near the School of Biosciences. More recently, an episode of the BBC show <em><a>Hustle</a></em> was filmed on campus with interior and exterior shots of the Aston Webb building, in addition to internal shots of the School of Biosciences.</p>
<p><a>Post punk</a> band <a>Joy Division</a> played their final gig at the University High Hall on 2 May 1980 (now known as Chamberlain Hall), 16 days before the suicide of singer/songwriter, <a>Ian Curtis</a>. A recording of the performance accompanies the <em><a>Still</a></em> compilation album. It includes one of only two available recordings of the song &quot;<a>Ceremony</a>&quot; (the other being a demo rehearsal), which would later become a single for <a>New Order</a>. Fairport Convention recorded much of the live album &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot; at Lake Hall during the May Ball on 11 May 1979, using the Island Records mobile studio.</p>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The University's logo from the 1980s until 2005</a> The original coat of arms was designed in 1900. It features a double headed lion (on the left) and a mermaid holding a mirror and comb (to the right). These symbols owe to the coat of arms of the institution's predecessor, Mason College.</p>
<p>In 2005 the university began rebranding itself. A simplified edition of the shield which had been introduced in the 1980s reverted to a detailed version based on how it appears on the university's original Royal Charter. After a research project into the image of the university, it was decided that a separate logo was required to redefine the institution as modern and contemporary. A new 'word marque', using the &quot;U and B&quot; letters and the <a>Baskerville</a> font (in honour of the Birmingham printer <a>John Baskerville</a>) is used as the primary logo when trying to attract both prospective investors and students. It is also found on campus vehicles. The traditional coat of arms, by contrast, appears on degree certificates and academic documents. The introduction of new signage throughout the campus, featuring the shield rather than the &quot;U and B&quot; logo, was completed at the end of 2006.</p>
