<h2>History</h2>
<p>Southern's roots stem from the establishment of Graysville Academy in Graysville, Tennessee, in 1892.  The school moved to the community of Thatcher's Switch in 1916, renaming it &quot;Collegedale&quot;.  In 1942, Kenneth A. Wright became president of the school. During Wright's administration, &quot;Southern Junior College&quot; became accredited as a four-year institution. A new name, &quot;Southern Missionary College&quot;, was adopted in 1944. Two men and four women received Southern's first baccalaureate degrees two years later.  It earned the nickname &quot;Southern Matrimony College&quot; because many young people married while attending Southern.  Renamed &quot;Southern College of Seventh-day Adventists&quot; in 1982, the school became a <a>university</a> in 1996. On September 9, 1996, trustees voted on a new name: &quot;Southern Adventist University&quot;.</p>
<p>In mid-1997, Gordon Bietz became president of Southern Adventist University. Academic expansion has continued, with 7 Master's degrees now offered in business, education, psychology, nursing, and religion. Fifty baccalaureate degrees are offered, 20 associate degrees, 38 minors, and two one-year certificate programs.  Over the past 13 years, Southern has grown by over 1,000 students, supassing all previous enrollment records. Southern is the largest undergraduate institution in the <a>North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists</a>.</p>
<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<p>Southern Adventist University as a whole is accredited by the <a>Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> and the <a>Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools, Colleges, and Universities</a>.  Individual schools and programs are also accredited by various degree-specific professional organizations and accrediting agencies.</p>
<h2>Recent events</h2>
<p>On the morning of April 26, 2005, a fire broke out in the Thatcher Hall Dormitory. One student died and two others were injured. Though the fire has been ruled an accident, the cause has yet to be determined. The area of the building in which the fire occurred was not equipped with <a>fire sprinkler</a>s, though smoke detectors and fire alarms were in place and functioned properly. Sprinklers, as well as other fire safety measures that go well beyond what is required, have been installed in Thatcher Hall.</p>
<p>In 2006, Southern received national recognition for its use of interactive gaming as a learning tool in <em>Campus Technology</em> magazine. The university was selected as one of 16 institutions from nearly 500 entries to be listed as a <em>Campus Technology</em> 2006 Innovator. </p>
