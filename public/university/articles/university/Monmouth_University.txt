<p> </p>
<p><strong>Monmouth University</strong> is a private university located in <a>West Long Branch, New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1933 as Monmouth Junior College, it became Monmouth College in 1956, and later Monmouth University in 1995 after receiving its <a>charter</a>.</p>
<p>There are about 4,300 full-time and 444 part-time <a>undergraduate</a> and 1,750 <a>graduate</a> students, as well as 251 full-time faculty members. About 73% of faculty members hold <a>Ph.D.</a>s or other <a>terminal degree</a>s in their field of study. The university's student-to-faculty ratio is about 15:1. Because of the university's relatively small student population, class sizes are capped between 20 and 35 and no classes are taught by <a>teaching assistant</a>s. 44% of students live on-campus. Most of Monmouth's student body is drawn from the northeastern United States, although students from 29 states and 28 foreign countries add to the school's diversity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Monmouth College was founded in 1933 as a <a>junior college</a>. On January 18, 1956, Monmouth received accreditation to grant four-year <a>Bachelor's degree</a>s, and in March 1995, it received its university charter from the <a>New Jersey Commission on Higher Education</a>.</pre>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The centerpiece of the Monmouth University campus is Wilson Hall. Originally, it was the site of the Shadow Lawn mansion, constructed in 1903 and housed 52 rooms. United States President <a>Woodrow Wilson</a> stayed in the mansion during his campaign in summer of 1916. </p>
<p>After Shadow Lawn was destroyed by a fire in 1927, the building that would become Wilson Hall was built as a residence for Mr &amp; Mrs. Hubert Templeton Parson. Mr. Parson was the former head of <a>F.W. Woolworth Company</a>. The building was designed by <a>Horace Trumbauer</a> and <a>Julian Abele</a>. Abele is regarded as the first professional African American architect.</p>
<p>Wilson Hall became <a>municipal property</a> during the <a>Great Depression</a> and until Monmouth University acquired ownership, it was home to Highland Manor Junior College, a private girls' school. Today, it is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>. Some classrooms and the administrative offices are inside of the building. In 1980, Wilson Hall was used as <a>Daddy Warbucks</a>' mansion in the <a>film version of <em>Annie</em></a>.</p>
<p>The school is believed by some students to be haunted. A documentary, <em>Shadows of Shadow Lawn</em> documented the school's alleged haunting. A book investigating the school's haunting, <em>Shadows at the Shore</em>, will be released in October 2010.</p>

<p><a>right|thumb|Monmouth Hawks logo</a>  Monmouth's athletic teams are known as the Hawks. The school competes as a Division I school in the <a>Northeast Conference</a>. Monmouth fields the following sports at the Division I level: baseball, basketball (men's and women's), bowling (women's) cross country (men's and women's), field hockey, football, golf (men's and women's), indoor track (men's and women's), lacrosse (women's), soccer (men's and women's), softball, tennis (men's and women's), and track &amp; field (men's and women's). </p>
<p>Monmouth University (then still Monmouth College), added <a>football</a> to the school's ledger of sports teams in 1993. The team's first game was played on September 25 of that year. The first points in school history were scored on a bizarre defensive play by intercepting and returning a <a>two-point conversion</a>.</p>
<p>A new Multipurpose Activity Center opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 16, 2009. The  Center currently serves as the primary indoor athletic structure. It houses a 4,100 seat competition arena; a 200-meter; six-lane indoor track; locker rooms; educational and conference space; ground-level bookstore; and fitness center. The new facility adjoins the <a>William T. Boylan Gymnasium</a> a 2,500-seat arena built in 1965.</p>

<p>Monmouth has been in the <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> in 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2006. Monmouth won their first NCAA men's basketball <a>tournament game</a> in 2006 when they beat <a>Hampton University</a> in that year's <a>play-in game</a>.
