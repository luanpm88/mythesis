<p>The <strong>University of Lincoln</strong> is an <a>English</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Lincolnshire</a>. It was founded in 1992, although its origins can be traced back to the foundation of the <a>Hull</a> <a>School of Art</a> 1861.</p>
<p>The founding of the Brayford Campus in 1996 by <a>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</a>, further revitalised and elevated <a>Lincoln</a>. The Independent describes the university as &quot;the best thing to happen to Lincoln since the Romans&quot;.</p>
<p>The main campus is in the Brayford Pool area of Lincoln and there are further campuses in <a>Riseholme</a>, <a>Holbeach</a> and <a>Hull</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Lincoln's official crest bears the head of <a>Minerva</a>, the <a>Ancient Roman</a> goddess of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>The University of Lincoln is the newer of the two Higher Education institutions in Lincoln, the older being <a>Bishop Grosseteste University College</a>.  </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The University of Lincoln's roots can be traced back to 1861. These can be traced back to a number of higher educational institutions in <a>Hull</a>, including the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), Endsleigh Training College (1905) and the Hull Central College of Commerce (1930).</p>
<p>The higher educational institutions, namely the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), Endsleigh Training College (1905), Hull Central College of Commerce (1930) and <a>Kingston upon Hull College of Education</a> were merged in September 1976 to form the Hull College of Higher Education. In 1983 this institution became the Humberside College of Higher Education (&quot;HCHE&quot;) when it absorbed several courses in fishing, food and manufacturing which were running in <a>Grimsby</a>.  HCHE gained <a>polytechnic</a> status in 1990, and then in 1992 was one of the many polytechnics in the UK to become full universities.</p>

<h3>Early 1990s</h3>
<p><a>thumb|230px|right|Brayford Pool</a></p>
<p>The cathedral city of Lincoln was without its own university until 1992. Thus, a university establishment was planned at the southwest end of Lincoln's City centre overlooking the <a>Brayford Pool</a>. This was to be combined with the existing <a>University of Humberside</a> to form the University of Lincoln, which was originally known as the <strong>University of Lincolnshire and Humberside</strong>.</p>
<h3>21st century</h3>
<p><a>Higher education</a> in Lincoln was consolidated in 2001 when the University acquired <a>Leicester</a>-based <a>De Montfort University</a>'s schools in Lincolnshire: the Lincoln School of Art and Design in uphill Lincoln, and the <a>Lincolnshire School of Agriculture</a>'s sites at Riseholme, <a>Caythorpe</a> and Holbeach. Caythorpe was later closed permanently and its activities moved to Riseholme. Courses held in <a>Grimsby</a> were also moved to Lincoln around this time.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|upright|University of Lincoln</a> Throughout the late-1990s, the University's sites in Hull were considerably scaled down as the focus shifted towards Lincoln. In 2001 this process was taken a step further when the decision was made to move the administrative headquarters and management to Lincoln and to sell the Cottingham Road campus in Hull, the former main campus, to its neighbour, the <a>University of Hull</a> - The site is now the home of the <a>Hull York Medical School</a>.  The University still maintains a smaller campus, the Derek Crothall Building, in Hull city centre. A smaller campus and student halls on Beverley Road, Hull, were also sold for redevelopment.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes, the '<a>Humberside</a>' was dropped and the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside became the &quot;University of Lincoln&quot;.</p>
<p>On 28 October 2004, following its redevelopment as a specialist <a>Food science</a> technology park, the campus at Holbeach was reopened by <a>John Henry Hayes</a>, the <a>Member of Parliament</a> for <a>South Holland and the Deepings</a>.</p>
<p>More recently the University's Forensic Science department has been one of only four Universities in the UK accredited by the <a>Royal Society of Chemistry</a>, and the department's BSc (Hons) Forensic Science course is accredited by the Forensic Science Society. The Psychology degree is accredited by the British Psychological Society. The Lincoln school of Journalism is also accredited by the BJTC, making it a nationally recognised course among leading broadcasters, including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News.</p>
<p>The university received one of the highest scores in the NSS survey as well as recognition for its contribution to research in the Lincolnshire area.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|The University of Lincoln seen at day from across the Brayford Pool</a> The University has expanded rapidly on the Brayford site since its opening in 1996. Buildings on the Brayford now include a School of <a>Architecture</a> designed by <a>Rick Mather</a>, a science <a>laboratory</a> facility, a sports centre, and a university <a>library</a>.</p>

<p>The main administration building at the Brayford campus was initially designed with the proposed function of a showroom. The large, open <a>atrium</a> space is surrounded by balconies on several floors, with lecture halls on the ground floor with classrooms and support departments on the higher floors.</p>
<p>The University also maintains several buildings of historic interest in uphill Lincoln (the &quot;Cathedral&quot; campus), including a building named after <a>Chad Varah</a>, founder of <a>the Samaritans</a>. At Riseholme, set amongst a  estate and working <a>farm</a> is the former residence of the <a>Bishop of Lincoln</a>. The main building at the much-reduced campus in Hull has been renamed in honour of the late Professor Derek Crothall, a former Pro Vice Chancellor of the University.</p>
<h3>Student accommodation</h3>
<p>In Lincoln, the university's on-campus student accommodation, &quot;The Student Village&quot;, is a waterfront complex situated near the university's academic buildings on the Brayford campus.  There are 17 blocks of self-catering apartments, each apartment housing 5 to 8 students. Some apartments have specifically designed rooms for students with disabilities. The site has a range of facilities with a total of 1,037 bedrooms available.</p>
<p>In 2005, the university's halls of residence were leased to a charitable trust for a premium of &#x00a3;30&nbsp;million. As part of the deal the university would forego the rent that they would have ordinarily received. Part of the &#x00a3;30m will be used to fund the future development plans.</p>
<p>At Riseholme the university has three separate halls of residence.</p>
<h3>Catering</h3>
<p>The University of Lincoln operates a number of catering outlets. The main outlet is situated in the Main Admin Building on the Brayford campus. There are additional outlets in Hull, Greestone, Chad Varah, Thomas Parker House, Riseholme, LPAC, Engine Shed, Architecture Building and also in the newly opened Enterprise@Lincoln building. Once open there will also be facilities in the new Business &amp; Law building.</p>
<h3>Sports Centre</h3>
<p>The University of Lincoln Sports Centre is primarily used to accommodate the needs of both students and staff of the University of Lincoln, providing them with opportunities to participate in fitness classes and many sports based activities. Facilities include: Double sports hall, 4 squash courts, Synthetic pitches, Fitness suite, Dance studio, 8 Badminton / short tennis courts, 2 Basketball courts, 2 Volleyball courts, 2 Netball courts, 2 five-a-side football pitches and a seven-a-side football pitch.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>thumb|The new library building, seen at night.|</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>Located in the <a>Great Central Warehouse</a> (&quot;GCW&quot;) building, a renovated former industrial <a>railway</a> goods <a>warehouse</a>, the University Library was opened in December 2004 on the Brayford campus. There are smaller libraries at the university's three branch campuses, Holbeach, Kingston-upon-Hull and Riseholme. In total, the university's four libraries house more than a third of a million items.</p>
<p>The building has won several awards for its conversion from a derelict former railway grain-storage warehouse. The GCW was constructed in 1907 by the <a>Great Central Railway</a>. It spent the second half of the twentieth century as a builder's warehouse before falling in to disrepair in 1998.</p>
<p>It was converted into a library (designed by the University's in-house team of architects) and was formally opened in 2004 by the chief executive of the UK's <a>Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, the conversion won gold and silver for conservation and regeneration at the <a>Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a> (RICS) Regional Awards in Leicester. It has also gained awards from the <a>Royal Institute of British Architects</a> (RIBA).</p>
<p>The main venue consists of four bars - The Upper Tower Bar, The Engine Shed bar, The Mezzanine bar and the Lower Tower Bar - space for up to 2,000 people on any given night.</p>
<p>The Engine Shed has also played host to a number of high profile artists, including <a>30 Seconds to Mars</a>, <a>Bloc Party</a>, <a>Dizzee Rascal</a>, <a>The Ting Tings</a>, <a>Bowling For Soup</a>, <a>The Charlatans</a>, <a>Chase &amp; Status</a>, <a>The Zutons</a>, <a>Embrace</a>, <a>The Cooper Temple Clause</a>, <a>Deftones</a>, <a>The Beautiful South</a>, <a>Dirty Pretty Things</a>, <a>Babyshambles</a>, <a>Kings of Leon</a>, <a>Stereophonics</a>, <a>Reverend And The Makers</a>, <a>The Kooks</a>, <a>The Guillemots</a>, <a>The Human League</a>, <a>Supergrass</a>, <a>The Courteeners</a>, <a>Editors</a> and <a>The Cribs</a>.</p>
<p>Recent months have seen the Engine Shed open their doors to the Year 11 Proms, the Gay Pride Festival, the Lincoln Comedy Festival, and to the general public for hire.</p>
<h3>Lincoln Performing Arts Centre</h3>
<p> <a>right|thumb|230px|LPAC</a> The Lincoln Performing Arts Centre (LPAC) (opened in January 2008) houses a 450-seat multipurpose auditorium designed for live arts performances, conferences, and film screenings. The theatre's programme of events is designed to complement, rather than compete with, those of its neighbouring venues.</p>
<p>LPAC also does educational and outreach arts work with local communities. The &#x00a3;6 million centre is also home to the Lincoln School of Performing Arts (LSPA) where around 240 students study for both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in drama and dance. LSPA includes the new Centre for Innovation in Performing Arts.</p>
<p>The building is home to the Lincoln School of Performing Arts. Arranged around the theatre are studios for dance, drama and music, as well as office spaces and control and dimming rooms designed to enable instruction of students during live performance. The centrepiece of the new building is the 450-seat theatre which hosts professional touring theatre, music and dance productions in addition to providing a platform for showcasing work within the professional programme from students of the Lincoln School of Performing Arts.</p>

<h3>Cultural references</h3>
<p>In August 2000, the university's Learning Resources Centre (now the Media, Humanities &amp; Technology building) was the location for some of <a>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and <a>Aaron Eckhart</a>'s scenes in <em><a>Possession</a></em>, the 2002 adaptation of <a>A. S. Byatt</a>'s eponymous novel..</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>According to the university, more than 50 different nationalities are represented among the student population on the Brayford Pool campus.</p>
<p>Based on the available 2007/2008 academic year data,&lt;ref  name=&quot;LincolnFAF&quot; /&gt; the total student population (on campus) was 9,695 (8,984 <a>undergraduates</a> and 711 <a>postgraduates</a>), while 179 were off-campus. The university releases the independent student newspaper <a>The Linc</a>, founded in 2007.</p>
<h3>University of Lincoln Students' Union</h3>
<p>The University of Lincoln Students' Union, (ULSU), was refounded in 2001, along with the university. It was formed as a &quot;students' union <a>co-operative</a>&quot;, the first of its kind in the UK.  All students were required to buy into the membership of the Union, and following a pledge of alliance, were bestowed by the Union a far greater say in the decision-making process. Regular member meetings were held, across the various campuses; all student members could, in theory, speak and present motions to be voted on, which would be accepted by the Union, if they were constitutional.</p>
<p>However, various legislative changes in the UK &#x2013; as well as more practical problems (such as the cost of insuring the Union) &#x2013; meant that the co-operative structure was not viable in the longer term.  Accordingly, in 2007, the Union was reconstituted as a <a>company limited by guarantee</a>, and <a>registered as a charity</a>, introducing a more conventional governance structure. The Students' Union publishes <em>Bullet Magazine</em> six times a year</p>
<p>ULSU's All Student Meeting passed a motion at in November 2009 to replace the officer structure with four full-time paid sabbatical officers and nine part-time unpaid officers, from July 2010.</p>
<p>The Engine Shed is home to Students' Union offices and the Student Opportunities, Activity &amp; Participation (SOAP) Centre, the Athletic Union (AU), the UL Careers Centre and the Lincoln University Volunteers Centre (&quot;LUV Shack&quot;).</p>
<h3>Alumni</h3>
<p>Notable <a>alumni</a> include <a>Mary Parkinson</a>, television presenter and the wife of fellow television presenter <a>Michael Parkinson</a> and <a>Martin Vickers</a>, <a>MP</a> for <a>Cleethorpes</a>. <a>Sir Ian Botham</a> was awarded with an <a>honorary degree</a> titled <a>Doctor of Science</a> in 2010.</p>
