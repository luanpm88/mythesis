<p> <strong>Illinois Wesleyan University</strong> is an independent undergraduate <a>university</a> located in <a>Bloomington</a>, <a>Illinois</a>.  Founded in 1850, the central portion of the present campus was acquired in 1854 with the first building erected in 1856.  It comprises 17 academic departments offering 50 majors and 476 courses.  </p>
<p>The University's mission is to foster the traditional liberal arts of creativity, character, and knowledge.  Its motto - Scientia et Sapientia, or &quot;Knowledge and Wisdom&quot; - was coined by famed explorer and Wesleyan Professor <a>John Wesley Powell</a>.  </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Illinois Wesleyan University was founded in 1850 by diverse group of 30 civic and religious leaders who came together to establish &quot;an Institution of learning of Collegiate grade.&quot; When a sponsor was needed, the founders gained support from the United Methodist Church, which is how &quot;Wesleyan&quot; was added to the original name, &quot;Illinois University.&quot; While maintaining its Methodist affiliation, Illinois Wesleyan continues to be a diverse and inclusive community, independent in its governance.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Right|200px|John Wesley Powell (right)</a> Illinois Wesleyan&#x2019;s tradition of engaging its students inside and outside the classroom dates back to its earliest days when explorer-geologist <a>John Wesley Powell</a>, a one-armed Civil War veteran and a founder of the National Geographic Society, joined the faculty in 1865. A pioneer of using field work in teaching science, Powell in 1967 took Illinois Wesleyan students to Colorado's mountains &#x2014; the first expedition of its kind in U.S. higher education. </p>
<p>The liberal arts and sciences have been at the foundation of Illinois Wesleyan's curriculum since its inception, and the fine arts were taught from its earliest years in the 19th century. </p>
<p><a>thumb|left|175px|TKE Founders</a> In 1899, five students founded a fraternity named &quot;The Knights of Classic Lore&quot;. The Knights of Classic Lore would go on to become the first chapter of <a>Tau Kappa Epsilon</a> less than a decade later.  </p>
<p>On May 15, 2009, the University announced the beginning of its &quot;Transforming Lives&quot; fundraising campaign.  The campaign aims to raise $125,000,000 to create endowed faculty positions, increase the number of grants and scholarships to students, create an expanded Theatre Arts Complex, a new Center for Instruction, and new student housing.</p>

<h3>Ames Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Right|300px|The rear of Ames Library</a> Wesleyan's Ames Library was completed in 2002.  It contains over 368,000 volumes spread over five floors.  The Ames Library also houses 8 sets of stained glass panels originally from Pembroke College at <a>Oxford University</a>.  Among the special collections are the papers of former U.S. Congressman Leslie C. Arends; the Gernon collection of first editions of detective fiction and mysteries; and the Schultz collection of 18th and 19th Century British Drama, including <a>The Beggar's Opera</a>.  Construction cost $25.7 million; Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbot were the principle architects.</p>
<h3>May Term</h3>
<p>Illinois Wesleyan offers a May Term course option.  The University refers to it as a 4-4-1 system.  This allows any student who has completed a full course-load in either the Spring or Fall Semesters of that academic year to enroll in a May Term class.</p>
<p>May Term classes last for approximately three weeks during the month of May.  Students take several hours of instruction in the same course each day for five days each week.  This allows the students to immerse themselves in that one topic.  At the end of the May Term a student completes the equivalent of a single course during one semester.  </p>
<p>May Term emphasizes curricular experimentation, and also offers an opportunity for service projects, study-abroad, and internships.</p>
<p>May Term is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Play Term&quot; by the students of Illinois Wesleyan. This applies to very few students as most of the May Term classes meet three hours every day and the workload is that of an entire semester. &quot;Play&quot; simply refers to the fact that there is more time to lounge on the quad, get off campus, and spend time with friends. Classes may also be more participatory or have lighter topics than those offered during the traditional semesters.</p>
<h3>Study abroad</h3>
<p>Illinois Wesleyan offers a number of study abroad opportunities, and ranks in the top 40 schools in the nation for students studying abroad.  IWU's International Office provides support for over 300 Global Study Abroad Options in 70 countries.  Domestically, IWU offers a UN semester, a Washington Semester, and the <a>Chicago Center</a>.  Internationally it offers programs in London and Barcelona. It also maintains a very strong relationship with <a>Pembroke College, Oxford</a>, and traditionally sends a number of students there to study abroad.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>The University publishes 4 different undergraduate research journals in the fields of Political Science, Economics, History, and English. The John Wesley Powell Student Research Conference was established in 1990 to provide opportunities for students to present research projects and findings in a public and interactive manner.   The Action Research Center (ARC) was established in 2007 to partner student research and service projects with the wider Illinois community. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I still have faith in America because I love America and I believe that we will continue to build a coalition of conscience that one day will solve this problem.&#x00a0; We sing a little song in our movement and it has been our guiding faith.&#x00a0; Sometimes we&#x2019;ve been facing hooded perpetrators of violence; sometimes we face jeering mobs.&#x00a0; Sometimes we face dogs and the gushing waters from fire hoses.&#x00a0; Sometimes in crowded jail cells we join hands to sing it.&#x00a0; And sometimes in just open mass meetings.&#x00a0; But we could sing it as a hymn of faith.&#x00a0; We shall overcome, we shall overcome, deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome. </p>
</blockquote>
