<p>   <a>thumb|Part of the UWE campus at Frenchay</a> The <strong>University of the West of England</strong> (abbrev. <strong>UWE</strong>, often pronounced &quot;you-we&quot;) is a <a>university</a> based in the <a>English</a> city of <a>Bristol</a>. Its main campus is at <a>Frenchay</a>, about five miles (8 km) north of the city centre. UWE also has a smaller campus at <a>St Matthias</a>, a School of Health and Social Care at <a>Glenside</a> in north-east Bristol and the <a>School of Creative Arts</a>, located at <a>Bower Ashton</a>, near <a>Ashton Court</a> in south-west Bristol.</p>
<p>There are also regional centres in <a>Bath</a> and <a>Swindon</a>, and an associate faculty specialising in agricultural and sports related courses in <a>Hartpury</a>, <a>Gloucestershire</a>. This satellite college has staged the European Young Rider Championship, a horse riding competition. <a>Bristol Old Vic Theatre School</a> is an associate school of the Faculty of Humanities, Languages and Social Sciences.</p>
<p>With around 30,000 students and 3,000 academic staff, UWE is the larger of the two universities in the city (the longer established <a>University of Bristol</a> has 23,000 students). 86% of students at UWE are from state schools. The well-stocked library on the Frenchay site is called the Bolland Library, named after Dr Robert Bolland, the first director of Bristol Polytechnic from 1969 to 1974. The main Frenchay campus is situated close to the <a>M32 motorway</a>, twenty minutes walk from the well-connected <a>Bristol Parkway railway station</a>. By train, Cardiff is half an hour away, Birmingham one hour and fifteen minutes away and <a>London Paddington station</a> is one hour and twenty minutes away.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>UWE was founded in 1970 as <em>Bristol Polytechnic</em>, however its roots go back to the foundation of the <em><a>Merchant Venturers</a>' Navigation School</em> in 1595. Part of this institution (to which the Universities of Bristol and <a>Bath</a> also partly owe their origins) became a technical college which, after merger with various other colleges, in turn became the polytechnic. Like the other former <a>polytechnics</a>, this gained University status and its present name as a result of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act, 1992</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Bower Ashton</a> site was formed in 1969 as the West of England College of Art which was formerly the art school of the Royal West of England Academy in Queens Road, Bristol.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The college buildings on Ashley Down Road.</a></p>
<p>The <a>St Matthias</a> site was a former teacher training college as was Redland College, and became part of Bristol Polytechnic around 1976 together with <a>Ashley Down</a>, Bower Ashton, Frenchay, and Unity Street.</p>
<p>The Avon and Gloucestershire College of Health (now the <a>Glenside</a> Campus) and the Bath and Swindon College of Health Studies joined in January 1996. Hartpury joined in 1997.</p>
<p>An &#x00a3;80 million student village located at the Frenchay campus, which includes a sports centre and rooms for 2000 students, opened in 2006.</p>

<h3>Research Assessment</h3>
<p>UWE is one of the leading and fastest growing new universities for research with a particular emphasis on interdisciplinary and collaborative research with a wide range of public and private partners. The Research Assessment Exercise 2008 showed that over a third (37%) of research carried out at UWE was considered to be world-leading or internationally excellent. As a result UWE increased its research funding allocation from HEFCE by 122%, one of the biggest increases in the country.In the 2001 edition of the Research Assessment Exercise UWE averaged a score of 3a (where 1 is the lowest and 5* is the highest possible), achieving similar results to the other mid-table universities. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise UWE averaged between 3* and 2* (where 1 is the lowest and 4* is the highest), stating that almost half of research originating from UWE is internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour.</p>

An art materials shop and stores provide discounted art materials and the UWE Students Union runs a licensed bar and shop. Every year in June the campus houses a Degree Show which is well attended by Bristol residents as well as friends and families of the graduating students.</p>
<p>Among its Principals and Deans were the war artist Jack Chalker, the Graphic Designer Paul van Der Lem, and Paul Gough RWA, a Fine Artist, who became the first Pro-Vice Chancellor and Executive Dean of the Faculty in its expanded form of over 2,600 students.

This new structure will be put into operation during the academc year 2009/10.</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>Echoing Bristol's long connection with the sea and the Merchant Venturers' Navigation School, the top of the crest depicts a ship's mainmast and rigging. The flaming fire basket indicates guidance, hope and the desire for learning.</p>
<p>The shield at the centre is adapted from that of the College of St Matthias with the wavy line representing the rivers of <a>Avon</a> and <a>Severn</a>. The <a>unicorn</a> is taken from the arms of the City of Bristol and the sea stag from those of the former <a>County of Avon</a>. Both these creatures wear a crown of <a>King Edgar</a> around their necks. Edgar is regarded as a local monarch because he was crowned in <a>Bath Abbey</a> in 973. The wavy lines enclosed in circles on the shoulders represent the fountain of knowledge and learning. Bower Ashton will be retained for a longer period, but may ultimately move.</p>
<h4>Criticisms</h4>
<p>Students and local residents in Stoke Park have complained about the poor transport facilities to the university, citing a severe lack of buses and parking spaces. The university has claimed that parking facilities are handled by the local authority and they will not grant additional spaces to the area for the foreseeable future, even with a new campus and more students studying in the area.</p>
<h2>National College for Legal Training</h2>
<p><strong>The National College of Legal Training</strong> (NCLT) is a collaboration between UWE and Central Law Training, launched in January 2010 to provide postgraduate legal training. Currently NCLT offers a two-year, part-time <a>Legal Practice Course</a> and Professional Skills Course. A full time LPC, a Graduate Diploma in Law (<a>GDL</a>) and a Top-up <a>LLM</a> will be launched soon. NCLT Study centres are located at <a>Coventry University</a>, <a>Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, <a>Southampton Solent University</a> and <a>University of Westminster</a>.</p>
