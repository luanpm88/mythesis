It was founded by <a>Duke Rudolph IV</a> in 1365 and is the oldest university in the German-speaking world and one of the largest in Europe. According to the <a>THE&#x2013;QS World University Rankings</a> it was ranked 132 of the overall world's best universities and 46 among the best universities in the field of Arts and Humanities.

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|240px|left|University of Vienna, main building, seen from across the Ringstra&#x00df;e</a> The University was founded on March 12, 1365 by <a>Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria</a> and his two brothers, <a>Albert III, Duke of Austria</a> and <a>Leopold III, Duke of Austria</a>, hence the additional name &#x201c;Alma Mater Rudolphina&#x201d;. After the <a>Charles University</a> in <a>Prague</a> and <a>Jagiellonian University</a> in <a>Krakow</a>, the University of Vienna is the third oldest university in <a>Central Europe</a> and the oldest university in the German-speaking world.</p>
<p>In 1365, <a>Rudolph IV</a> sanctioned a deed of foundation for a doctoral-level university in Vienna, modelled on the <a>University of Paris</a>. However, <a>Pope Urban V</a> did not ratify the deed, specifically in relation to the department of <a>theology</a>, presumably due to pressure exerted by <a>Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, who wished to avoid competition for the <a>Charles University in Prague</a>. Approval was finally received from the Pope in 1384 and the University of Vienna was granted the status of a full university, including the Faculty of Catholic Theology.  The first university building opened in 1385.</p>
<p>The current main building on the <a>Ringstra&#x00df;e</a> was built between 1877 and 1884 by <a>Heinrich von Ferstel</a>. The previous main building was located close to the <em>Stuben</em> Gate (Stubentor) on Iganz Seipel Square, current home of the old University Church (<em>Universit&#x00e4;tskirche</em>) and the <a>Austrian Academy of Sciences</a> (<em>&#x00d6;sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften</em>).  Women were admitted as full students from 1897, although their studies were limited to Philosophy. The remaining departments gradually followed suit, although with considerable delay: <a>Medicine</a> in 1900, <a>Law</a> in 1919, <a>Protestant</a> Theology in 1923 and finally <a>Roman Catholic</a> Theology in 1946. Ten years after the admission of the first female students, <a>Elise Richter</a> became the first woman to receive <em><a>habilitation</a></em>, becoming professor of Romance Languages in 1907; she was also the first female distinguished professor.</p>
<p>Following the <a>Anschluss</a>, the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime, in 1938 the University of Vienna was reformed under political aspects and a huge number of teachers and students were dismissed for political and &quot;racial&quot; reasons.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a>thumb|240px|Main Ceremonial Chamber (<em>Gro&#x00df;er Festsaal</em>) in the Main Building</a> The academic facilities of the University of Vienna occupy more than sixty locations throughout the city of Vienna. The historical Main Building on the Ringstra&#x00df;e constitutes the University's center, as the seat of the university's executive and most of its administrative offices. The nearby <a>Campus of the University of Vienna</a> forms an additional, more spacious, focus of the University. A large number of academic facilities, including the new Lecture Hall Complex, are situated there.</p>
<h2>National and international rankings</h2>
<p>The University of Vienna was placed 85th in the <a>Times Higher Education's</a> World University Rankings in 2007, rising from 87th place in 2006. The University was also ranked 46th in the world in the field of <a>social sciences</a> in 2007.  The University placed in the top 100 in the 2003-2005 editions of <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The University of Vienna, like all universities and academies in Austria, once featured a system of democratic representation. Power in the university was divided equally among three groups: students (the largest group), junior faculty and full professors. All groups had the right to send representatives to boards, who then voted on almost every issue.</p>
<p>The former government, headed by then-chancellor <a>Wolfgang Sch&#x00fc;ssel</a>, reformed the university system so that power is now concentrated with the full professors. The reform also introduced a board of governors and tuition fees (about &#x20ac;367 per semester in 2007-these now only apply to non-EU students,students from within the EU only pay the &#x00d6;Hfee). The reforms also separated the medical departments into separate medical schools, such as the <a>Medical University of Vienna</a>.</p>
<h3>Research and teaching</h3>
<p>The research and teaching activity of the university is undertaken by some 6,500 scholars. Of these, approximately 980 are active in projects financed by third parties.</p>
<h3>Faculties and Centres</h3>
<p>The faculties and centres of the University include: <a>Catholic Theology</a>; <a>Protestant Theology</a>; <a>Law</a>; <a>Business</a>, <a>Economics</a> and <a>Statistics</a>; <a>Computer Science</a>; <a>Historical and Cultural Studies</a>; <a>Philological and Cultural Sciences</a>; <a>Philosophy</a> and <a>Education</a>; <a>Psychology</a>; <a>Social Sciences</a>; <a>Mathematics</a>; <a>Physics</a>; <a>Chemistry</a>; <a>Earth Sciences</a>, <a>Geography</a> and <a>Astronomy</a>; <a>Life Sciences</a>; <a>Translation Science</a>; <a>Sport Science</a> and University <a>Sport</a>s; and <a>Molecular Biology</a>.</p>

<h3>Library history</h3>
<p><a>Rudolph IV</a>, in the Foundation Deed of 12 March 1365, had already provided for a <em>publica libraria</em>, where the valuable books bequeathed by deceased members of the University should be collected. Through many legacies, this collection was subsequently greatly increased and became the basis of the old <em>Libreye</em> that was accommodated in the same building as the student infirmary. In addition, there were libraries in the separate Faculties and in the Duke's College. </p>
<p>From the 17th Century, interest in the old library, with its manuscripts and incunabulae, went into decline and the modern library in the Jesuit College came to the fore. In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which <a>Gerard van Swieten</a> was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new &quot;Academic Library&quot; was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of <a>Maria Theresa of Austria</a>, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during <a>Emperor Joseph II's</a> dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to <a>Heinrich von Ferstel's</a> new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Vienna's University Library is the largest collection of books in <a>Austria</a>, with the greatest problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes today, three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries.</p>
<h2>International acclaim</h2>
<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the University of Vienna 143rd overall in the world.
