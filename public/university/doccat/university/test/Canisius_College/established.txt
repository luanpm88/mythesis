<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Canisius College of Buffalo, commonly referred to as Canisius, has a long and proud history in the city of Buffalo.
The first campus was on Ellicott St. in the city and was created in response to a growing need for higher education in the area.
Buffalo was composed of many ethnic groups and one of the larger populations was German in origin.
As Europe experienced political turmoil, more and more people left for America especially after the failed revolutions of 1848.
By 1866, Prussia had exerted considerable pressure on its Germanic neighbors which cause many more people to leave.
The college formed with <a>Canisius High School</a> as a natural response to the needs of the Catholic community.
The <a>college archives</a> has an extensive collection pertaining to the history of the college and its founding.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2007, the college announced plans to raise $90 million by the year 2010 for capital improvements and to enhance the college&#x2019;s endowment.
It is the largest fund-raising initiative in the college&#x2019;s history.
Of the $90 million goal, $47 million will fund the creation of an interdisciplinary science center at the college.
Included in this program was the full acquisition of a 1,500 space parking ramp which will provide room for additional commuter students.
The college announced on November 20, 2008 the acquisition of the building from The Uniland Partnership of Delaware LP. </p>
Canisius was included in [[Kaplan]]'s list of &quot;America's 367 Most Interesting Schools.&quot;</pre>
<p>Canisius offers more than 70 majors, minors and special programs.

<p>In <a>2008</a>, Canisius men's <a>lacrosse</a> won the MAAC tournament and earned its first ever bid to the <a>NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship</a> tournament.</p>
<p>The 2008 Baseball team won the regular season MAAC championship for the first time in its history with a 41-13 record breaking the school record for wins in a season.
One season later, the team advanced to its first MAAC Championship game in program history.</p>
The cup commemorates the athletic rivalry between Canisius College and Niagara University.
The college adopted it in 1932, after Charles A. Brady ('33) wrote a story in a Canisius publication honoring Buffalo's centennial year as a city.
Brady wrote about Rene-Robert LaSalle's <a>Le Griffon</a>, the first European ship to sail the upper Great Lakes, built here in <a>Buffalo</a>.
<p>According to GoGriffs.com, the <a>griffin</a> is a &quot;mythical creature of supposed gigantic size that has the head, forelegs and wings of an eagle and the hindquarters, tail and ears of a lion.&quot;
It represents values such as strength, vigilance, and intelligence, all of which befit a college and qualities that one would look for in students and athletes alike.
<p>The College was also the home field of the <a>Buffalo All-Americans</a> of the early <a>National Football League</a>.
The All-Americans played several of their games at Canisius before relocating to <a>Bison Stadium</a> in 1924.</p>
<p>All of Canisius College's <a>fraternities and sororities</a> are approved by the Canisius College Office of Campus Programing and Leadership Development and each has strict policies against hazing.
A list of organizations approved by the college can be found here:<a>Canisius Greek Life</a></p>
