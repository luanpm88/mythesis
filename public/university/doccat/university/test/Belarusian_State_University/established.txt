<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decision to establish Belarusian State University, as a first national university of <a>Belarus</a>, was made on 25 February 1919 by the government of the <a>Byelorussian SSR</a>.
However, <a>Minsk</a> was occupied by the Polish army at the time, and the university was actually established in 1921 in Minsk.</p>
<p><a>Vladimr Picheta</a>, historian and Slavonic languages expert, became first rector of the BSU.
The university staff was formed by professors and lecturers transferred from universities of <a>Moscow</a>, <a>Kazan</a> and <a>Kiev</a>.
<p>During the 1930s the university became not only the key center for education and research in Soviet-controlled Belarus, but also led to branching out of specialized educational institutions and to the establishment of <a>Belarusian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>By 1941, just before the 20th anniversary of the university, there have been 6 Faculties: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, Biology, History, Geography and Languages.
<p>In June 1941 Minsk was occupied by <a>Nazi Germany</a>; some students and academic staff were evacuated to the east, some joined the <a>Soviet Army</a> or partisan brigades.
Some of university buildings were destroyed, some were used by the Germans as hospitals and offices.</p>
<p>In May 1943 Belarusian State University was re-established at <a>Skhodnya</a>, a suburban settlement to the north-east of <a>Moscow</a>.
Some of former students and academics joined the re-established university.
Its libraries were newly formed through donations from universities and colleges of Moscow.</p>
<p>In August 1944 first group of students and academic staff returned to Minsk, and regular classes re-started in autumn 1944.
