<p>The <strong>USC School of Cinematic Arts</strong>, until 2006 named the <strong>School of Cinema-Television</strong> (CNTV), is a <a>film school</a> within the <a>University of Southern California</a> in <a>Los Angeles, California</a>.

<p>On September 19, 2006, USC announced that alumnus <a>George Lucas</a> had donated US$175 million to expand the film school with a new  facility.
His previous donations resulted in the naming of two existing buildings after him and his then-<a>wife</a>, though Lucas was not fond of the architecture used in those buildings.
An architectural hobbyist, Lucas laid out the original designs for the project, inspired by the <a>Mediterranean Revival Style</a> that was used in older campus buildings as well as the Los Angeles area.
The project also received another $50 million in contributions from <a>Warner Bros.</a>, <a>20th Century Fox</a> and <a>The Walt Disney Company</a>.
<li>In 1967, <a>George Lucas</a> won the National Student Film Festival (NSFF) award for his futuristic <em><a>Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB</a></em>.</li>
