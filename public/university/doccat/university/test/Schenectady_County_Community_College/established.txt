<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Schenectady County Board of Representatives</a> formed Schenectady County Community College on January 26, 1967 and then purchased the former Van Curler hotel which required renovations so that classes could commence in the building in 1969.
The Van Curler would be renamed Elston Hall after Charles W. Elston, the long standing, original board member and eight-year chairperson for the Schenectady County Board of Representatives.</p>
<p>The first of a number expansions occurred in 1978, with the building that houses the Begley library, a television stations, lecture halls, and a wing for the music department along with the Carl B. Taylor Community Auditorium.
A 1982 expansion added the Tempo Building, housing four classrooms and continuing education.
Also completed in 1992 was a South Wing expansion which created four new <a>culinary arts</a> labs, expanded upon the Casola Dining Room, and added a childcare center, and an enclosed bridge that connected Elston Hall with the Center for Science and Technology which is located across the street from the school's main campus.</p>
<p>In 2000 the Gateway Building was erected  for childhood development classes and a childcare center.
Additionally a new quad area was build in front of Elston Hall.</p>
<p>In 2006 a $6.3 million dollar expansion to the Culinary Arts department began off of Elston Hall and was completed in 2007.
This expansion was funded in part by fund raising activities along with $3,082,300 from the <a>County of Schenectady</a>.</p>
