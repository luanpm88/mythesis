It is part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Parkside was created by an act of the Wisconsin Legislature in 1965.
The University was officially founded in July 1968 when it took over two-year UW centers in <a>Kenosha</a> and <a>Racine</a>.
UW&#x2013;Parkside broke ground for the new campus in November 1967 and accepted its first on-site students in fall 1969.
The University was an original outgrowth of the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison, which expanded its educational offerings to the southeastern Wisconsin region with the opening of the 4-year institution.
In 1971, when <a>the University of Wisconsin</a> and the <a>Wisconsin State Universities</a> merged, UW&#x2013;Parkside became part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a>.
Robert D. Felner, Dean of Education at the University of Louisville, was selected to become the Chancellor in 2008, but shortly before taking office it was revealed that he was the subject of a Federal investigation, and he resigned before ever becoming Chancellor.
<p>The first students graduated from UW&#x2013;Parkside in June 1970.
Since then, more than 17,000 students have earned degrees.</p>
<p>UW&#x2013;Parkside is a complex of buildings interconnected by an indoor walkway.
The older buildings, constructed between 1967 and 1976 at a cost of more than $40 million, occupy a small portion of the  campus, which lies within <a>Kenosha</a> <a>county</a>.
Louis</a> in the late 1960s, the beautiful, low-profile design helps the campus complex blend in with its natural surroundings.
The newly renovated Student Union along with the newly constructed Pike River Suites were constructed in a manner that seamlessly blends into the existing campus.
The expansion to the Communication Arts building is scheduled to be completed in time for the fall 2011 school year.</p>
<p>The campus has hundreds of acres of restored <a>prairie</a>s, mature <a>oak</a> and <a>maple</a> forests and a meandering creek.
The University also owns hundreds of acres of off-campus <a>nature preserves</a> in Kenosha and counties.</p>
<p>The University has 475 <a>All-Americans</a>, 75 national champions, 34 academic <a>All-Americans</a> and four <a>Olympian</a>s.
