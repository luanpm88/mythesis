<p>  <strong>George Michael Low</strong>, born <strong>George Wilhelm Low</strong> (June 10, 1926 &ndash; July 17, 1984) was a <a>NASA</a> administrator and 14th President of <a>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>.
He was born near <a>Vienna</a>, <a>Austria</a> to Artur and Gertrude Burger Low, small business people in Austria.
With the German occupation of Austria in 1938, four years after Artur Low's death, his family emigrated to the United States.
In 1943, Low graduated from Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills, <a>New York</a>, and entered <a>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> (RPI), where he joined the <a>Delta Phi</a> <a>fraternity</a>.
His education was interrupted by the war and from 1944 to 1946, in which he served in the <a>U.S. Army</a>.
While doing so, he became a <a>naturalized</a> American citizen, and legally changed his name to George Michael Low.</p>
<p>After military service Low returned to RPI and received his Bachelor of Aeronautical Engineering degree in 1948.
He then worked at General Dynamics (Convair) in <a>Fort Worth, Texas</a>, as a mathematician in an aerodynamics group.
Low returned to RPI late in 1948, however, and received his Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1950.
In 1949, he married Mary Ruth McNamara of <a>Troy, New York</a>.
<p>After completing his M.S. degree, Low joined the <a>National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA) as an engineer at the <a>Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory</a> in <a>Cleveland, Ohio</a> (later the Lewis Research Center and now the Glenn Research Center).
He became head of the Fluid Mechanics Section (1954-1956) and Chief of the Special Projects Branch (1956-1958).
Low specialized in experimental and theoretical research in the fields of heat transfer, boundary layer flows, and internal aerodynamics.
<p>During the summer and autumn of 1958, preceding the formation of the <a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), Low worked on a planning team to organize the new aerospace agency.
Soon after NASA's formal organization in October 1958, Low transferred to the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he served as Chief of Manned Space Flight.
In this capacity, he was closely involved in the planning of Projects <a>Mercury</a>, <a>Gemini</a>, and <a>Apollo</a>.</p>
<p>In February 1964, Low transferred to NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in <a>Houston, Texas</a> (now the <a>Johnson Space Center</a>), and served as Deputy Center Director.
In April 1967, following the <a>Apollo 1</a> fire, he was named Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) where he was responsible for directing the changes to the Apollo spacecraft necessary to make it flight worthy.
<p>George Low became NASA Deputy Administrator in December 1969, serving with Administrators <a>Thomas O. Paine</a> and <a>James C. Fletcher</a>.
As such, he became one of the leading figures in the early development of the <a>Space Shuttle</a>, the <a>Skylab</a> program, and the <a>Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a>.
Several contemporaries blamed Low for the shabby treatment <a>Saturn V</a> creator <a>Wernher von Braun</a> received in the early 1970s while at NASA Headquarters.
Space&quot; by Bob Ward, published 2005 by the Naval Institute Press), Low was jealous of von Braun's fame and helped force the German rocketman's unhappy departure from the space agency.
However, in a later von Braun biography, the alleged connection between Low's NASA leadership and von Braun's resignation was disputed as unproven, (&quot;Von Braun&quot; by Michael Neufeld, published 2007 by the Smithsonian Institution / Alfred A. Knopf).
<p>Retiring from NASA in 1976, he became president of RPI, a position he still held at his death.
On July 16, 1984, the White House announced that Low had been awarded the <a>President&#x2019;s Medal of Freedom</a> for his contributions to education and the nation&#x2019;s space program.
He died of <a>cancer</a> on the following day.
The New York State Center for Industrial Innovation was renamed the <a>George M. Low Center for Industrial Innovation</a> by RPI (&quot;Rensselaer,&quot; as of 1996) shortly after his death.</p>
<p>In the 1996 TV movie <em><a>Apollo 11</a></em> Low was played by <a>Dennis Lipscomb</a>.
In the 1998 miniseries <em><a>From the Earth to the Moon</a></em> he was played by <a>Holmes Osborne</a>.</p>
