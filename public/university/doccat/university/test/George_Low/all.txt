established$$$@@@%%%He became head of the Fluid Mechanics Section (1954-1956) and Chief of the Special Projects Branch (1956-1958).
established$$$@@@%%%Low specialized in experimental and theoretical research in the fields of heat transfer, boundary layer flows, and internal aerodynamics.
website$$$@@@%%%In addition, he worked on such space technology problems as orbit calculations, reentry paths, and space rendezvous techniques.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the summer and autumn of 1958, preceding the formation of the <a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), Low worked on a planning team to organize the new aerospace agency.
established$$$@@@%%%Soon after NASA's formal organization in October 1958, Low transferred to the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he served as Chief of Manned Space Flight.
established$$$@@@%%%In this capacity, he was closely involved in the planning of Projects <a>Mercury</a>, <a>Gemini</a>, and <a>Apollo</a>.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%In April 1967, following the <a>Apollo 1</a> fire, he was named Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) where he was responsible for directing the changes to the Apollo spacecraft necessary to make it flight worthy.
type$$$@@@%%%In this role he spearheaded the use of FMEA, <a>Failure mode and effects analysis</a>, to rigorously define the possible risks to human space flight.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This effort helped return the Apollo project schedule to the promised date for the Moon landing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>George Low became NASA Deputy Administrator in December 1969, serving with Administrators <a>Thomas O. Paine</a> and <a>James C. Fletcher</a>.

affiliations$$$@@@%%%According to a von Braun biography (&quot;Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%Space&quot; by Bob Ward, published 2005 by the Naval Institute Press), Low was jealous of von Braun's fame and helped force the German rocketman's unhappy departure from the space agency.
established$$$@@@%%%However, in a later von Braun biography, the alleged connection between Low's NASA leadership and von Braun's resignation was disputed as unproven, (&quot;Von Braun&quot; by Michael Neufeld, published 2007 by the Smithsonian Institution / Alfred A. Knopf).
