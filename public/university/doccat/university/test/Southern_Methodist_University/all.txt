affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Southern Methodist University</strong> (<strong>SMU</strong>) is a private university in University Park, Texas (an enclave of Dallas, Texas).
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1911 by the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>, SMU operates campuses in University Park, <a>Plano</a>, and <a>Taos, New Mexico</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%SMU is owned by the South Central Jurisdiction of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
campus$$$@@@%%%6,000 of the University's 11,000 students are undergraduates.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was chartered on <a>April 17</a>, 1911 by the five <a>Annual Conference</a>s in Texas of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Classes were originally planned to start in 1913 but were postponed until 1915.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>SMU was established as the unsuccessful attempt to relocate <a>Southwestern University</a> from <a>Georgetown, Texas</a> to either Fort Worth or Dallas.
established$$$@@@%%%The first relocation effort by <a>Polytechnic College</a> president <a>Hiram A. Boaz</a> and spearheaded by Southwestern president <a>Robert Stewart Hyer</a> involved merging Southwestern with Polytechnic College (now Texas Wesleyan University).
established$$$@@@%%%The post-merger university would retain the Southwestern name while occupying Polytechnic's campus in Fort Worth.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The merger never came to fruition, primarily because the Dallas Chamber of Commerce set up a committee to raise funds and entice Southwestern to relocate to Dallas.
campus$$$@@@%%%This proposal gained considerable traction since Southwestern was operating a medical school in Dallas.
established$$$@@@%%%Plans were drawn for the campus's first building, Memorial Hall, which inspired SMU's first building, Dallas Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%Southwestern's trustees rejected the relocation plan, prompting Hyer's resignation and move to Dallas to establish Southern Methodist University.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>SMU retained close connections to Southwestern and Polytechnic.
president$$$@@@%%%Southwestern president Hyer became SMU's first president.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Hiram A. Boaz, a Southwestern graduate, resigned as president of Polytechnic to become SMU's second president.
established$$$@@@%%%Polytechnic attempted to become a feeder school of SMU before becoming a women's college.
established$$$@@@%%%SMU acquired Southwestern's medical school in Dallas and operated it until 1915.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Southwestern and SMU were athletic rivals until Southwestern became a small liberal arts college.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the <a>General Conference</a> of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new <a>connectional institution</a> in the wake of a 1914 <a>Tennessee Supreme Court</a> decision stripping the church of authority at <a>Vanderbilt University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The church decided to support the establishment of SMU and dramatically increase the size of <a>Emory University</a> at a new location in <a>DeKalb County, Georgia</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the 1914 meeting of the General Conference, SMU was designated the connectional institution for all <a>Conferences</a> west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Classes were planned to officially begin in 1913, but construction delays on the university's first building prevented classes from starting until 1915.
established$$$@@@%%%In the interim, the only functioning academic department at SMU was the medical college it had acquired from Southwestern University.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>SMU named its first building Dallas Hall in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university's location.
established$$$@@@%%%Dallas Hall remains the university's symbol and centerpiece.
established$$$@@@%%%Designed by <a>Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge</a> after the Rotunda at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, Dallas Hall opened its doors in 1915 and housed the entire university as well as a bank and a barbershop.
established$$$@@@%%%Dallas Hall is registered in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%SMU's nickname &quot;The Hilltop&quot; was inspired by Dallas Hall, which was built on a hill.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university's first president, Robert Stewart Hyer, selected <a>Harvard crimson</a> and <a>Yale blue</a> as the school colors in order to associate SMU with the high standards of ivy league universities.
established$$$@@@%%%Several streets in <a>University Park</a> were named after prominent universities, including <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Purdue</a>, <a>Tulane</a>, <a>Amherst</a>, <a>Bryn Mawr</a>, <a>Drexel</a>, <a>Hanover</a>, <a>Marquette</a>, <a>Southwestern</a>, <a>Vassar</a>, and <a>Villanova</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1939, SMU was placed under the South Central Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university drew considerable media attention in 1987 when the <a>NCAA</a> administered the <a>death penalty</a> against the SMU football program for repeated, flagrant recruiting violations.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The punishment included cancellation of the 1987 and most of the 1988 football season and a two year ban from Bowl Games and all televised sports coverage.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2008, SMU was selected as the site of the <a>George W. Bush Presidential Library</a> and the George W. Bush Policy Institute.</li>
