Founded in 1911 by the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>, SMU operates campuses in University Park, <a>Plano</a>, and <a>Taos, New Mexico</a>.
SMU is owned by the South Central Jurisdiction of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was chartered on <a>April 17</a>, 1911 by the five <a>Annual Conference</a>s in Texas of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
Classes were originally planned to start in 1913 but were postponed until 1915.</p>
<p>SMU was established as the unsuccessful attempt to relocate <a>Southwestern University</a> from <a>Georgetown, Texas</a> to either Fort Worth or Dallas.
The first relocation effort by <a>Polytechnic College</a> president <a>Hiram A. Boaz</a> and spearheaded by Southwestern president <a>Robert Stewart Hyer</a> involved merging Southwestern with Polytechnic College (now Texas Wesleyan University).
The post-merger university would retain the Southwestern name while occupying Polytechnic's campus in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>The merger never came to fruition, primarily because the Dallas Chamber of Commerce set up a committee to raise funds and entice Southwestern to relocate to Dallas.
Plans were drawn for the campus's first building, Memorial Hall, which inspired SMU's first building, Dallas Hall.
Southwestern's trustees rejected the relocation plan, prompting Hyer's resignation and move to Dallas to establish Southern Methodist University.</p>
Polytechnic attempted to become a feeder school of SMU before becoming a women's college.
SMU acquired Southwestern's medical school in Dallas and operated it until 1915.
<p>The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the <a>General Conference</a> of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new <a>connectional institution</a> in the wake of a 1914 <a>Tennessee Supreme Court</a> decision stripping the church of authority at <a>Vanderbilt University</a>.
The church decided to support the establishment of SMU and dramatically increase the size of <a>Emory University</a> at a new location in <a>DeKalb County, Georgia</a>.
At the 1914 meeting of the General Conference, SMU was designated the connectional institution for all <a>Conferences</a> west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>Classes were planned to officially begin in 1913, but construction delays on the university's first building prevented classes from starting until 1915.
In the interim, the only functioning academic department at SMU was the medical college it had acquired from Southwestern University.</p>
<p>SMU named its first building Dallas Hall in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university's location.
Dallas Hall remains the university's symbol and centerpiece.
Designed by <a>Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge</a> after the Rotunda at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, Dallas Hall opened its doors in 1915 and housed the entire university as well as a bank and a barbershop.
Dallas Hall is registered in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
SMU's nickname &quot;The Hilltop&quot; was inspired by Dallas Hall, which was built on a hill.</p>
<p>The university's first president, Robert Stewart Hyer, selected <a>Harvard crimson</a> and <a>Yale blue</a> as the school colors in order to associate SMU with the high standards of ivy league universities.
Several streets in <a>University Park</a> were named after prominent universities, including <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Purdue</a>, <a>Tulane</a>, <a>Amherst</a>, <a>Bryn Mawr</a>, <a>Drexel</a>, <a>Hanover</a>, <a>Marquette</a>, <a>Southwestern</a>, <a>Vassar</a>, and <a>Villanova</a>.</p>
<p>In 1939, SMU was placed under the South Central Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>The university drew considerable media attention in 1987 when the <a>NCAA</a> administered the <a>death penalty</a> against the SMU football program for repeated, flagrant recruiting violations.
<p>In 2008, SMU was selected as the site of the <a>George W. Bush Presidential Library</a> and the George W. Bush Policy Institute.</li>
