<p>  The <strong>University of Texas at Dallas</strong>, also referred to as <strong>UT Dallas</strong> or <strong>UTD</strong>, is a public <a>research university</a> in the <a>University of Texas System</a>.
The main campus is in the heart of the <a>Richardson</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>Telecom Corridor</a>,  north of <a>downtown</a> <a>Dallas</a>.
The institution, established in 1961 as the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest and later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS), began as a research arm of <a>Texas Instruments</a>.
In 1969 the founders bequeathed SCAS to the State of Texas and <a>Governor Preston Smith</a> signed the bill officially creating the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
With a number of interdisciplinary degree programs, its curriculum is designed to allow study that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and to enable students to participate in collaborative research labs.
The <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classifies UT Dallas as a &quot;high research activity&quot; institution and the university is designated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research by the <a>National Security Agency</a>.
Almost  of new facilities were added from 2007 to the summer of 2010 and an additional  planned for completion by the summer of 2013.
In addition to the new facilities a $30-million dollar campus landscape enhancement was completed in late 2010.
The university received a &quot;B-&quot; on the 2011 <em>College Sustainability Report Card</em>, which includes efforts to protect and conserve natural resources.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Founders Building</a> The UT Dallas founders, <a>Eugene McDermott</a>, <a>Cecil Howard Green</a> and <a>J.
Erik Jonsson</a>, purchased <a>Geophysical Service Incorporated</a> (GSI) on December 6, 1941, the day before the <a>attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.
With the increase in defense contracts the General Instrument Division of GSI grew to the point it was reorganized as Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) in 1951 with GSI a wholly owned subsidiary.
TI was forced to recruit talent from other states during its expansion and the founders observed in 1959 that &quot;To grow industrially, the region must grow academically; it must provide the intellectual atmosphere, which will allow it to compete in the new industries dependent on highly trained and creative minds&quot;.
The institute initially was housed in the Fondren Science Library at <a>Southern Methodist University</a>.
Land for the center was acquired by Jonsson, McDermott, and Green in Richardson in 1962 and the first facility, the Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science (later named the Founders Building), opened on the grounds of the present-day UTD campus in 1964.
The Graduate Research Center of the Southwest was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967 and in 1969 the founders transferred the land and assets of SCAS to the State of Texas.
Following recommendations from the Coordinating Board of the Texas College and University System, on June 13, 1969, Governor Preston Smith signed the bill adding the institution to the University of Texas System and creating the University of Texas at Dallas.
In 1969 the school accepted its first students.
<p><a>thumb|Engineering and Computer Science Complex</a> In July 1971, <a>Bryce Jordan</a> became the university&#x2019;s first president and served until 1981.
During Jordan's 10 year tenure the university's campus expanded with the addition of a number of new facilities including the Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building..
The <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded.
Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students.

The university has more than 50 research centers and institutes and documented 44 patents in 2009.
For the fiscal year ending August 2010, UTD's research expenditures totaled $84.6 million and the school notes a 60 percent increase in federal research expenditures over the past four years.
Space science research has been a hallmark of the university since its inception in 1964.
The William B. Hanson Center for Space Studies (CSS), affiliated with the Department of Physics, conducts research in space <a>plasma physics</a>.
It has its roots in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Laboratory of the university's predecessor.
The center also conducts a NASA-sponsored mission, <a>Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI)</a>, which was launched in April 2008 in cooperation with the United States Air Force.
CINDI, which is part of the payload for the <a>Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System</a> program, seeks to uncover information about the equatorial plasma bubbles that interrupt radio signals.
Furthermore, under the leadership of <a>John H. Hoffman</a>, the center designed the <a>mass spectrometer</a> for the <a>Phoenix Mars Lander</a> as part of the <a>Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer</a> (TEGA) experiment in cooperation with the <a>University of Arizona</a>.</p>

Including <a>ISO</a> <a>7</a> <a>cleanroom</a> facilities, the $85 million building provides open floor plans that allows chemists, biologists, nanotechnologists, materials scientists and other specialists to conduct multidisciplinary research.
The <a>Nanoelectronics</a> Materials Laboratory, on the fourth floor, includes a system that allows researchers to deposit thin film materials one atomic layer at a time.
In 2010 a JEOL ARM200F scanning transmission electron microscope, <a>HAADF</a>-<a>STEM</a>, with an atomic resolution of 0.08 <a>nanometers</a>, was added to the research laboratory, already home to two transmission electron microscopes.</p>
<p>The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences).
Research, at the center,  includes the causes, prevention, assessment and treatment of communication disorders and the facilities include laboratories for research in child language development and disorders, autism spectrum disorders, speech production, hearing disorders, neurogenic speech and language, cochlear implants and aural habilitation.
The UTD <a>Center for BrainHealth</a> was founded in 1999.
Harold Clarke, the Ashbel Smith professor of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, and Marianne Stewart, professor of political science are the co-principal investigators for the study, which began in 1964 and is one of the world's oldest continuous political research projects.

<p><a>thumb|Student Services building</a> Early architecture on the campus exhibits typical characteristics of <a>Brutalism</a>, a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built.
This later modern styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (sometimes called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles).
The Student Services building, completed in 2010, is rated as a <a>LEED</a> Platinum Building and features a limestone fa&#x00e7;ade that has the appearance of floating from various points within the facility.
Many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of <a>skyway</a>s.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Campus all&#x00e9;e</a> A 30-million dollar Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott the wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010.
Each tree hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after careful study of native stands in Texas, which includes the commitment to a <a>riparian</a> corridor consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus <a>All&#x00e9;e</a>.
The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis to be eventually covered in wisteria vines and a temperature-modifying shade structure design.
The university also received a $1-million dollar anonymous gift designated for the care of the trees.
The landscape architecture firm of <a>Peter Walker and Partners</a> (PWP) was the prime consultant for the project.
By the summer of 2010, almost  of new facilities have been added to the campus since 2007.
The UT System Board of Regents has approved plans for a second $31 million  freshman Residence Hall.
The UT System Board of Regents has also approved plans for a new, , University Bookstore and Visitors Center.
