established$$$@@@%%%The university is one of <a>two polytechnics</a> in the 23-member <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cal Poly Pomona began as a satellite campus of the California Polytechnic School (today known as <a>Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>) in 1938 when a completely equipped school and farm in the city of <a>San Dimas</a> were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son <a>Jerry Voorhis</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The satellite campus, initially called the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit, grew further in 1949 when an  <a>horse ranch</a> in the neighboring city of Pomona became part of the school grounds.
established$$$@@@%%%The ranch belonged to retired businessman <a>Will Keith Kellogg</a> who had originally deeded it to the <a>University of California</a> in 1932.

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Events leading to the foundation of present-day Cal Poly Pomona began with the demise of the Voorhis School for Boys in <a>San Dimas, California</a> and its acquisition by the California Polytechnic College (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo or Cal Poly S.L.O.) in 1938.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cal Poly S.L.O. had originally been founded as a <a>vocational</a> <a>high school</a> in <a>San Luis Obispo, California</a> when California Governor <a>Henry Gage</a> signed the Polytechnic School Bill on March 8, 1901.
established$$$@@@%%%Voorhis School was established in 1928 and provided <a>elementary schooling</a> for underprivileged boys.
established$$$@@@%%%Its founder Charles B. Voorhis and <a>headmaster</a> <a>Jerry Voorhis</a> maintained the school opened throughout the worst years of the <a>Great Depression</a> but persistent economic pressures forced them to transfer control to Cal Poly S.L.O.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence, Voorhis School became the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit and its educational offerings were raised to the same level as Cal Poly S.L.O.&#x2019;s &#x2013;then a two-year college.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The entire horticulture program was moved to the new satellite campus and the two units operated as one institution spanning two locations under the leadership of president Julian McPhee.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During <a>World War II</a> most of the student body was called to active duty, enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943.
city$$$@@@%%%Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture.
established$$$@@@%%%Also in 1957, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the <a>College of Engineering</a>, the second academic unit after the <a>College of Agriculture</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors for the first time to 329 female students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1998, Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to <a>Robert Mugabe</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Mugabe&#x2019;s negative humanitarian record as president of Zimbabwe lead protests from staff, faculty and students ultimately forcing the university to rescind the award.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the 1990s and early 2000s, with the construction of the <a>CLA Building</a>, academic facilities, expansion to the <a>Cal Poly Pomona University Library</a> and the addition of programs such as the <a>Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies</a>, the <a>I-Poly High School</a> and <a>U.R.
