<p>The <strong>University of Rostock</strong> () is the <a>university</a> of the city <a>Rostock</a>, in the <a>German state</a> of <a>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1419, it is the oldest and largest university in continental <a>northern Europe</a> and the <a>Baltic Sea</a> area.
It is <a>the third oldest university</a> in <a>Germany</a> in continuous operation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1419 by confirmation of <a>Pope Martin V</a> and thus is one of the oldest universities in continental <a>Northern Europe</a>.
<p>Throughout the 15th century, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year, a large number at that time.
Rostock was among the largest universities in <a>Germany</a> at the time and many of its students also came from <a>Holland</a>, <a>Scandinavia</a> or other states bordering the <a>Baltic Sea</a>.
<p>In the course of political struggles and pressure from the church, the university moved to <a>Greifswald</a> in 1437 and remained there until 1443.
From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in <a>L&#x00fc;beck</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Rostock Universit&#x00e4;t 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]]] A few years later the city of Rostock, its university also became <a>Protestant</a> in 1542.
<a>Humanism</a> and <a>Lutheranism</a> were defining characteristics of the university.
After the <a>Thirty Years' War</a> (1618-1648), the University of Rostock played only a regional role.
When the &quot;ownership&quot; of the university moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy <a>Mecklenburg-Schwerin</a>) in 1827, however, things changed for the better.
The end of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's <a>alma mater</a> and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, <a>Albert Einstein</a> and <a>Max Planck</a> received <a>honorary doctorate</a>s on 12 November 1919.
This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein.
Interestingly enough, the doctorate was not revoked during the <a>Nazi rule</a> in Germany (1933-1945), despite such orders by the Nazis.
<p>The end of the <a>Second World War</a> in 1945 brought many changes.
The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later <a>German Democratic Republic</a>), was re-opened on 24 February 1946.
The <em>Faculty of Law</em> was closed in 1951, a <em>Faculty of Agriculture</em> was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a <em>Department of Shipbuilding</em> (renamed <em>Faculty of Technology</em> in 1963).
The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty.
In 1952, the <em>Faculty of <a>Aviation</a></em> was opened, but eventually relocated to <a>Dresden</a>.</p>
<p>In 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit&#x00e4;t after <a>Wilhelm Pieck</a>, the first president of the <a>German Democratic Republic</a>.
The renaming was annulled after the <a>German reunification</a>.</p>
<p>In 1978, the university engaged in a partnership with the <a>Cochin University of Science and Technology</a> (CUSAT), to help design the course structure and support the development of the Department of Ship Technology at CUSAT.
Also, a group of Rostock faculty members were sent to CUSAT to improving the university's teaching facilities, remaining there until the late 1980s.
The prominent place of CUSAT's Department of Ship Technology in the world maritime industry is thus largely credited to the extensive support of the University of Rostock.</p>
