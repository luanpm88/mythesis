established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Rostock</strong> () is the <a>university</a> of the city <a>Rostock</a>, in the <a>German state</a> of <a>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Founded in 1419, it is the oldest and largest university in continental <a>northern Europe</a> and the <a>Baltic Sea</a> area.
established$$$@@@%%%It is <a>the third oldest university</a> in <a>Germany</a> in continuous operation.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was founded in 1419 by confirmation of <a>Pope Martin V</a> and thus is one of the oldest universities in continental <a>Northern Europe</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%In <a>Germany</a>, there are only five older universities: <a>Heidelberg</a> (1386), <a>Cologne</a> (1388), <a>Erfurt</a> (1392/1994), <a>W&#x00fc;rzburg</a> (1402/1582) and <a>Leipzig</a> (1409).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Throughout the 15th century, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year, a large number at that time.
established$$$@@@%%%Rostock was among the largest universities in <a>Germany</a> at the time and many of its students also came from <a>Holland</a>, <a>Scandinavia</a> or other states bordering the <a>Baltic Sea</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the course of political struggles and pressure from the church, the university moved to <a>Greifswald</a> in 1437 and remained there until 1443.
established$$$@@@%%%From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in <a>L&#x00fc;beck</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:Rostock Universit&#x00e4;t 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]]] A few years later the city of Rostock, its university also became <a>Protestant</a> in 1542.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Humanism</a> and <a>Lutheranism</a> were defining characteristics of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%After the <a>Thirty Years' War</a> (1618-1648), the University of Rostock played only a regional role.
established$$$@@@%%%When the &quot;ownership&quot; of the university moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy <a>Mecklenburg-Schwerin</a>) in 1827, however, things changed for the better.
established$$$@@@%%%The end of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's <a>alma mater</a> and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, <a>Albert Einstein</a> and <a>Max Planck</a> received <a>honorary doctorate</a>s on 12 November 1919.
established$$$@@@%%%This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein.
established$$$@@@%%%Interestingly enough, the doctorate was not revoked during the <a>Nazi rule</a> in Germany (1933-1945), despite such orders by the Nazis.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The reason for this remains unknown.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The end of the <a>Second World War</a> in 1945 brought many changes.
established$$$@@@%%%The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later <a>German Democratic Republic</a>), was re-opened on 24 February 1946.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em>Faculty of Law</em> was closed in 1951, a <em>Faculty of Agriculture</em> was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a <em>Department of Shipbuilding</em> (renamed <em>Faculty of Technology</em> in 1963).
established$$$@@@%%%The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1952, the <em>Faculty of <a>Aviation</a></em> was opened, but eventually relocated to <a>Dresden</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit&#x00e4;t after <a>Wilhelm Pieck</a>, the first president of the <a>German Democratic Republic</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The renaming was annulled after the <a>German reunification</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1978, the university engaged in a partnership with the <a>Cochin University of Science and Technology</a> (CUSAT), to help design the course structure and support the development of the Department of Ship Technology at CUSAT.
established$$$@@@%%%Also, a group of Rostock faculty members were sent to CUSAT to improving the university's teaching facilities, remaining there until the late 1980s.
established$$$@@@%%%The prominent place of CUSAT's Department of Ship Technology in the world maritime industry is thus largely credited to the extensive support of the University of Rostock.</p>
