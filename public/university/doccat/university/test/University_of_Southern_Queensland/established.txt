<p>  <strong>The University of Southern Queensland</strong> (USQ) is based in <a>Toowoomba, Queensland</a>, Australia.
The institution was established in 1967 as the Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs), in 1971 it became the <a>Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education</a>, and then the  University College of Southern Queensland in 1990; and finally USQ in 1992.</p>
<p>USQ has a substantial campus in <a>Hervey Bay</a> (Fraser Coast Campus) to the north of Brisbane, and has recently established a new campus at <a>Springfield</a> in <a>Brisbane</a>'s outer suburbs (2006).</p>
these can be undertaken via different modes of delivery for different periods of study.
<h2>History</h2>
This suburb was named College Heights on 25 September 1966 but was later renamed Darling Heights.</p>
The foundation principal was Mr J Wolfe who served until May 1967 when Mr Lindsay Barker became principal.</p>
<p>After the passage of the amended Education Act in 1971 the Institute became an autonomous multi-purpose college under the control of its own college council which subsequently determined that the new college would become the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education.</p>
<p>The School of Arts was formed in 1974.
The Institute established the External Studies Department in 1978 and this soon became a recognised benchmark in its field with UNESCO selecting it as a demonstration unit.
<p>The period spanning 1980 to 1990 saw a period of unprecedented growth of the Institute leading to the establishment of the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland.
<p>With the appointment of Professor Peter Swannell as Vice-Chancellor in 1996 the University underwent a further period of exceptional growth which included the establishment of a Wide Bay Campus, later renamed USQ Fraser Coast, and a Brisbane Centre in 1997, the USQ European Study Centre in Bretten, Germany in 1998 and the building of a number of landmark structures on campus.
<p>In 1999, USQ launched USQOnline, and was named winner of the Best Exporter Award in the Government Category of the National Multicultural Marketing Awards held by the New South Wales Ethnic Affairs Commission.
In 2000, USQ won the organisational category of the Queensland Government Multicultural Services Awards and was named joint winner of the Good Universities Guides 'Australian University of the Year (2000&#x2013;2001)' for demonstrated leadership in establishing the e-University.</p>
<p>In 2003, USQ opened Stage II of its Wide Bay Campus, constructed a research and manufacturing facility for Fibre Composites and established USQ International College, Fiji.
The University has an estimated annual economic injection into the economy of the region in excess of $150 million per annum.</p>
<p>In July 2004, USQ won the Commonwealth of Learning Award of Excellence for Institutional Achievement which recognises and honours excellence in distance education and open learning.
The Commonwealth of Learning is an intergovernmental organisation created by Commonwealth Heads of Government to encourage the development and sharing of open learning/distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.
<p>In December 2004, the University improved its distance education profile by being accredited with the Distance Education Training Council (DETC), an American public service organisation dedicated to identifying quality distance learning institutions.
The accreditation is an expression of confidence in the educational programs, policies and procedures of the University by its peers, and brings the institution recognition through the extension of special status by several American states under their legislation and regulations.</p>
<p>In Semester One 2006 the USQ Springfield campus opened its doors to more than 350 students in Brisbane&#x2019;s south-western corridor.
The Campus offers programs in Business, Science and Arts and is well known for its intensive mode, which is very popular at the postgraduate level.</p>
<p>The USQ Historical Archives, established in 2007, documents and maintains a secure, publicly accessible collection which records all aspects of the University's history for the purpose of research and to preserve the USQ memory.
<p> The University's governing body is the Council.
Members of the Council, representing University and community interests, contribute to the overall governance of the University by helping to set strategic directions and develop policy.
The University of Southern Queensland Act 1998 establishes the Council and defines the functions and powers of the Council and the University, and sets limits on what the University and its authorities may do.
The Council is advised by a number of key committees.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor is the University's chief executive officer and responsible to the Council for the overall direction of the academic, administrative, financial and other affairs of the University.
<p>The Academic Board is the University's senior academic advisory body.
The Board is responsible for making recommendations to Council on academic policy, regulations pertaining to the academic operation of the University and the implementation of approved policy.</p>
<p>On March 17, 2008, the University of Southern Queensland announced proposals to cut staff within the Department of Mathematics and Computing by more than 50%, planning to cut the existing faculty from 14 to 6.
This proposal was despite the federal government allocating additional funding specifically for mathematics and statistics which was approved in 2007 and flowing into USQ in 2008.
<p>The prominent expatriate Australian mathematician <a>Terence Tao</a> launched a publicity initiative to bring this to the attention of a broader audience .
<p>The University of Southern Queensland has 3 residential colleges located on its Toowoomba campus.
