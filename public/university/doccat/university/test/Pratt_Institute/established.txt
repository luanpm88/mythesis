<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY</a> <a>Charles Pratt</a> (1830&#x2013;1891) was an early pioneer of the natural <a>oil industry</a> in the United States.
He was founder of <a>Astral Oil Works</a> in the <a>Greenpoint</a> section of <a>Brooklyn, New York</a>.
He joined with his prot&#x00e9;g&#x00e9; <a>Henry H. Rogers</a> to form <a>Charles Pratt and Company</a> in 1867.
Both companies became part of <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>'s <a>Standard Oil</a> in 1874.
<p>Pratt is credited with recognizing the growing need for trained industrial workers in a changing economy.
In 1886, he founded and endowed the Pratt Institute, which opened in <a>Brooklyn</a> in 1887.</p>
<p>Pratt ended its engineering program in 1993 citing &quot;a continuous decrease in its enrollment and the growth of competition for a shrinking pool of prospective students.&quot;</p>

A residential campus, it offers several different kinds of residential options.
It has  two public entrances,which close in the evening hours.
The main gate on Willoughby Avenue (for pedestrians and cars) is guarded by a security post 24 hours a day.
Off-campus buildings include the newly renovated Higgins Hall which contains the School of Architecture and a new &quot;green&quot; building on <a>Myrtle Avenue</a> for digital arts programs and student services including admissions which opened in fall 2010.
<p><strong>Cannoneer Court</strong>, or the Cann, was designed by famed architecture firm SOM in 1986 and was constructed using a then-unique form of modular construction.
Each individual dorm room was constructed off-site and then set into place like building blocks.
The building has a lounge and work area as well as a garden courtyard.
Although it was meant for temporary housing in 1986, this building still stands today for use as freshman housing.
<p><strong>Esther Lloyd-Jones Hall</strong> is named for a trendsetter in modern American higher education.
Its central location on campus makes it desirable to students, with its clock tower serving as a campus landmark.</p>
The building can accommodate 50 students in efficiency apartments (double and single) and private single rooms within two- and three-bedroom apartments.
A double-efficiency apartment is two students sharing a one-room apartment (with kitchen and bath).
A single-efficiency apartment is one student in a private one-room apartment with kitchen and bath.
Each living room is furnished with a sofa, club chair, coffee table, kitchen table, and chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent A. Stabile Hall</strong> opened in the Fall of 1999.
Named for the donor and graduate of the Engineering School, it was designed for new undergraduate students.
It houses 240 students in four-person suites.
The award-winning design of the building boasts a large common lounge with smaller work and lounge spaces on each floor, all of which contribute to a vital living and working environment.</p>
The building was designed by Pratt Institute School of Architecture alumnus Jack Esterson AIA of the New York City architecture and engineering firm <a>WASA/Studio A</a>, and is on track to achieve LEED Gold Certification.</p>
<p><strong>The Pratt Manhattan campus</strong>, located at 144 West 14th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenue, is home to several of Pratt's graduate programs including the School of Information and Libray Science and Communication Design.
The Institute restored the building's exterior to its original facade highlighting its decorative architectural and design elements and renovated the interior to feature its high ceilings and wood beams.
A lovely staircase from the building's lobby leads to the <a>Pratt Manhattan Gallery</a> offering an rich array of shows from fine art and sculpture to fashion.</p>
<p>This new building houses the Graduate School for Information and Library Science, the Graduate Programs in Communications and Package Design, Design Management, Arts and cultural Management and the two-year Associates Degree Programs in Digital Design, Graphic Design and Illustration.
The modern building has many resources like a library, computer lab and meeting spaces.
<p>In 1977, the original school was opened in a nineteenth-century women's dress-design school, a New York City Landmark building at Lexington Avenue and 31st Street.
At this time, Manhattan had long been the epicenter of publishing design during the latter-twentieth century, and this new commercial-art-dedicated satellite was modeled to apply intensely concentrated vocational training in graphic design, illustration, package design, and textile design.
Its faculty was largely composed of Manhattan's working professionals, who themselves had achieved the level of skill necessary to meet the city's global-defining standards.
Magazines, books, music albums, movie posters, print and television advertisements and packaging for all forms of retail products were the intended goals for its graduates, as well as Manhattan's omnipresent fashion industry.
In addition, the below-ground space in the school was converted into a state of the art printmaking facility, teaching artist-created lithography, silkscreening and engraving.</p>
<p>Pratt also has a campus in <a>Utica, New York</a>, referred to as PrattMWP, at the <a>Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute</a>.
