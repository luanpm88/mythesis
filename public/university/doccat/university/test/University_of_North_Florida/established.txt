<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded in 1969 after one thousand acres (4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) midway between downtown Jacksonville and the <a>Jacksonville Beaches</a> were set aside for the campus,  of which were donated by Jacksonville's Skinner family.
Until this time, the only publicly funded institution of higher learning was <a>Florida Community College at Jacksonville</a>.
J. Daniel</a>, Chairman of the <a>Florida Board of Regents</a>, was instrumental in getting the University of North Florida in Jacksonville.
Construction on classrooms and buildings began in 1971 and UNF opened in the Fall of 1972 with an initial enrollment of 2,027 Juniors, supported by 117 faculty and more than 150 staff.
Originally, like the other Florida state institutions opened around this time, UNF was designated as a &quot;senior&quot; college, meaning that it would enroll only upper classmen and graduate students.</p>
The school was quick to expand, and was given accreditation by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1974.
The school's mascot is the <a>osprey</a> and was officially adopted in November 1979 over other popular choices such as the armadillo, the manatee and the seagull.
<p>In 1980, there was a legislative effort to merge UNF with the <a>University of Florida</a> and no longer be a self-sustained institution, but a bill proposing this was vetoed by Governor <a>Bob Graham</a>.
Enrollment at UNF exceeded 10,000 in 1995, and in Spring of 2000 it broke its commencement record, graduating over 1,000 students.</p>
<p>The 2000s saw a significant development on campus as many new buildings including the Social Science building, Science and Engineering building, College of Education and Human Services building, <a>Fine Arts Center</a>, <a>Student Union</a>, and Osprey Fountains residence hall were built.
In 2002, a 13-member Board of Trustees began work to oversee UNF.</p>
<p>UNF was officially reclassified as an <a>NCAA Division I</a> school for its athletics programs in 2009.</p>
Some of these buildings include the Coggin College of Business, the John E. Mathews, Jr. Computer and Information Sciences Building, and J. J. Daniel Hall.
In addition, the current library bears the name of the university's first president, <a>Thomas G. Carpenter</a>.
