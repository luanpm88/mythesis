affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>[[File:Cardinal Joseph Fesch.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Joseph Fesch]], an early benefactor of the College.]]
established$$$@@@%%%Spring Hill College was founded by the first <a>bishop of Mobile</a>, <a>Michael Portier</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%After purchasing a site for the College on a hill near Mobile, Bishop Portier went to France to find teachers and funds for the new college.
established$$$@@@%%%Portier recruited two priests and four seminarians from France to staff the school.
established$$$@@@%%%A friend of Portier, Cardinal <a>Joseph Fesch</a>, <a>Archbishop of Lyons</a>, was a major benefactor to the fledgling College, donating his philosophical and theological library and various works of art.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Pauline Jaricot</a>, founder of the <a>Society of the Propagation of the Faith</a>, also donated within three years 38,000 francs, an enormous sum in those days .
established$$$@@@%%%The bishop himself taught theology to the ecclesiastical students, who numbered six the first year.
established$$$@@@%%%Upon his return he rented a hotel next to the college grounds and started the first semester on May 1, 1830, with an enrollment of thirty students, making Spring Hill the oldest institution of higher education in Alabama.
established$$$@@@%%%On July 4 of the same year the bishop laid the cornerstone of the first permanent building.
established$$$@@@%%%It stood on the site of the present Administration Building and opened for classes in November 1831.
city$$$@@@%%%Spring Hill thus takes its place among the oldest colleges in the South.
type$$$@@@%%%It is the third oldest Jesuit college in the United States.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|The original main building, built in 1831.</a>
type$$$@@@%%%In 1836 the governor of Alabama, <a>Clement C. Clay</a>, signed a legislative act which chartered the College and gave it &quot;full power to grant or confer such degree or degrees in the arts and sciences, or in any art or science as are usually granted or conferred by other seminaries of learning in the United States.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%This power was used in the following year, 1837, when four graduates received their degrees.
established$$$@@@%%%The first two presidents of the College were called away to be bishops, one to <a>Dubuque, Iowa</a> (Bishop <a>Mathias Loras</a>), the other to <a>Vincennes, Indiana</a> (Bishop <a>John Stephen Bazin</a>), and the third, Father Mauvernay, died after a brief term of office.
established$$$@@@%%%Bishop Portier then found it necessary to transfer the College, first to the French <a>Fathers of Mercy</a>, and next to the <a>Society of Jesus and Mary</a>, both of whom lacked teaching and administrative experience.
established$$$@@@%%%He then persuaded the Fathers of the <a>Lyon</a>nais Province of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> to take possession of the College.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The new regime was inaugurated with Father <a>Francis Gautrelet</a>, S.J., as president in September 1847.
established$$$@@@%%%Since that time the institution has continued under Jesuit direction.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Following Hurricane <a>Katrina</a>'s widespread destruction along the central <a>Gulf Coast</a> in 2005, Spring Hill accepted 117 students, the majority of them from <a>Loyola University</a> in <a>New Orleans</a>, a brother Jesuit institution, for the remainder of the year.</p>
