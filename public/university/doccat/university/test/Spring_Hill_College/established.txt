<h2>History</h2>
Spring Hill College was founded by the first <a>bishop of Mobile</a>, <a>Michael Portier</a>.
After purchasing a site for the College on a hill near Mobile, Bishop Portier went to France to find teachers and funds for the new college.
Portier recruited two priests and four seminarians from France to staff the school.
A friend of Portier, Cardinal <a>Joseph Fesch</a>, <a>Archbishop of Lyons</a>, was a major benefactor to the fledgling College, donating his philosophical and theological library and various works of art.
<a>Pauline Jaricot</a>, founder of the <a>Society of the Propagation of the Faith</a>, also donated within three years 38,000 francs, an enormous sum in those days .
The bishop himself taught theology to the ecclesiastical students, who numbered six the first year.
Upon his return he rented a hotel next to the college grounds and started the first semester on May 1, 1830, with an enrollment of thirty students, making Spring Hill the oldest institution of higher education in Alabama.
On July 4 of the same year the bishop laid the cornerstone of the first permanent building.
It stood on the site of the present Administration Building and opened for classes in November 1831.
<p><a>thumb|The original main building, built in 1831.</a>
This power was used in the following year, 1837, when four graduates received their degrees.
The first two presidents of the College were called away to be bishops, one to <a>Dubuque, Iowa</a> (Bishop <a>Mathias Loras</a>), the other to <a>Vincennes, Indiana</a> (Bishop <a>John Stephen Bazin</a>), and the third, Father Mauvernay, died after a brief term of office.
Bishop Portier then found it necessary to transfer the College, first to the French <a>Fathers of Mercy</a>, and next to the <a>Society of Jesus and Mary</a>, both of whom lacked teaching and administrative experience.
He then persuaded the Fathers of the <a>Lyon</a>nais Province of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> to take possession of the College.
Since that time the institution has continued under Jesuit direction.</p>
<p>Following Hurricane <a>Katrina</a>'s widespread destruction along the central <a>Gulf Coast</a> in 2005, Spring Hill accepted 117 students, the majority of them from <a>Loyola University</a> in <a>New Orleans</a>, a brother Jesuit institution, for the remainder of the year.</p>
90% of the freshman class and 75% of the total student body live on campus.
Each of these divisions offers a variety of concentrations that students can choose majors and minors from.</p>
<p>Areas of concentration in <a>graduate</a> programs include Master of Business Administration, Teacher Education, Master of Liberal Arts, Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Theological Studies, Master of Pastoral Studies, and Master of Arts in Theology.
Certificate programs are offered in theology and ministry, with off&#x2013;campus classes offered in <a>Atlanta, Georgia</a>; <a>Birmingham, Alabama</a>; and <a>Jackson, Mississippi</a>.
There is also a program for students through the <a>Cooperative Center for Study Abroad</a> consortium that provides <a>study abroad</a> programs and internships in <a>England</a>, <a>France</a>, <a>Ireland</a>, <a>Spain</a>, <a>Italy</a> and <a>Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>For a number of years the Department of Theology has sponsored the Summer Institute of Christian Spirituality.
It features spirituality classes by regular faculty as well as internationally-known writers and an annual retreat.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Stewartfield and the Avenue of the Oaks</a> The Spring Hill College campus is located in the Spring Hill neighborhood of <a>Mobile, Alabama</a>.
The college has remained on the same campus that Bishop Portier purchased in 1830.
They include the <a>Sodality Chapel</a> (built 1850);  the <a>Spring Hill College Quadrangle</a>, comprising the Administration Building (1869), St. Joseph's Chapel (1910), and four other structures;  and <a>Stewartfield</a> (1849).
A renovation of the historic Administration Building was completed in 2008.
Academic clubs include the <a>Alpha Sigma Nu</a> club (the Jesuit Honor Society), Theta Alpha Kappa (Honor Society of Religious Studies and Theology) the English Club, the History Club, the Math Club, the Philosophy Club, and the <a>Sigma Tau Delta</a> club (English Honor Society.</p>
The Greek organizations participate in a &quot;deferred recruitment&quot; process, meaning that the formal recruiting activities occur at the beginning of the spring semester, as opposed to the more largely followed practice of recruitment at the beginning of the fall semester.</p>
