<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|225px|Foliage at UWF</a> <a>thumb|225px|The entrance of the John C. Pace library</a> In 1955, the Florida Legislature authorized the State Board of Education to locate a state university in <a>Escambia County</a>.
Following a feasibility study which demonstrated the need for an institution of higher education in Northwest Florida, funds were allocated for the development of the University of West Florida.
The founding President was <a>Harold Crosby</a>.
UWF became the sixth state university of the <a>State University System of Florida</a>, which today consists of eleven institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>Ground was broken on April 16, 1965, and in the same year the <a>Chambered Nautilus</a> was adopted as the official UWF emblem.
UWF was originally an upper-level institution enrolling juniors, seniors, and graduate students.
The first students began classes in the fall of 1967, and the first commencement exercises were held in June 1968 where 58 students received degrees.
In 1969, the university undergraduate programs were accredited by <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS) and the first master's degree programs were established.</p>
Following authorization by the <a>Florida Legislature</a>, a lower division was established, and freshmen attended the university for the first time in the fall semester of 1983, boosting enrollment from 5,200 students to 5,920 students.</p>
<p>In July 1988, <a>Computer Science</a>, a department within the College of Business, was identified as the Division of <a>Computer Science</a> as a stand alone and plans were begun to incorporate it into a fourth college, the College of Science and Technology.
That decision was later reversed and computer science was moved to the School of Computer Science and Engineering within the College of Arts and Sciences.
During the fall term of 1999, the colleges reorganized as the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and the College of Professional Studies.</p>

<p>The main campus of  of rolling hills and natural woodland along the <a>Escambia River</a> is ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of downtown <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>.
In addition to the main library on the main campus north of <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>, there is a branch library in <a>Fort Walton Beach, Florida</a>.
It has 628,000 printed volumes, 1 million <a>microfilm</a>s and <a>microfiche</a>s, 3,000 serial subscriptions and nearly 2,000 online journal subscriptions.
In addition, the University of West Florida has waterfront property on <a>Santa Rosa Island</a> that is available for recreational, academic, and research pursuits.
The University also operates the NWFSC/UWF Fort Walton Beach Campus, the <a>Eglin Air Force Base</a> Center and the <a>Hurlburt Field</a> Center.
As a result, a significant number of UWF students have been military personnel assigned to <a>NAS Pensacola</a>, <a>NAS Whiting Field</a>, <a>Eglin AFB</a>, <a>Hurlburt Field</a> and <a>Duke Field</a>.
<p> In 2001, the university acquired <a>West Florida Historic Preservation, Inc</a>, the previously state-controlled group that manages the <a>Historic Pensacola Village</a>.
A few years later, <a>John C. Cavanaugh</a> became the fourth president on July 15, 2002.
Under his supervision the university has created several classes taught by and/or in conjunction with the staff at Historic Pensacola.
The <a>Clara Barkley Dorr House</a> was also appropriated as a downtown home for the institute president.</p>
<p>The University of West Florida is a <a>public institution</a>, receiving most of its funding through state funds and <a>tuition</a>.
A 13-member <a>Board of Trustees</a> governs the University.

The University of West Florida and Jikei College Group in Japan established an educational partnership in 1989.
An official agreement was signed in January 1990 in Tokyo by Dr. Morris Marx, President of UWF, and Dr. Kunihiko Ukifune, Chairman and CEO of Jikei College Group.
The purpose of the partnership was to provide students, both American and Japanese, with opportunities to learn about each other's country.
On September 20, 1994, the office was formally named the Jikei-American Center and continues to be located on the main campus of UWF.
The collaboration between UWF and Jikei has set the model for international education.</p>
<p>The building includes prototype robot fabrication and testing laboratories, 3-D virtual reality simulators, a state-of-the-art holo deck and a glass wall atrium that helps put science into public view.
This collegiate facility is one of the first of its kind.</p>
<p>The shipwreck, which was discovered last summer in Pensacola Bay by two university students, is the remains of one of the colonization ships of the Tristan de Luna fleet that sank during a hurricane in 1559.
