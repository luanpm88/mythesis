Founded in 1804, it is the oldest university in the <a>Northwest Territory</a>, and ninth oldest public university in the <a>United States</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|225px|left|University Gateway on College Green</a></p>
<p>The <a>Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787 called for educational institutions as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the <a>Ohio Territory</a>: &quot;Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot;
In 1797, settlers from <a>Marietta</a> traveled up the <a>Hocking River</a> to establish a location for the school, choosing <a>Athens</a> due to its location directly between <a>Chillicothe</a> (the original capital of <a>Ohio</a>) and <a>Marietta</a>.
Originally chartered in 1802 as the American Western University, Ohio University was founded on February 18, 1804, when its charter was approved by the Ohio General Assembly.
Its founding came 11 months after <a>Ohio</a> was admitted to the Union.
The first three students enrolled in 1808.
In 1828, a free black man, <a>John Newton Templeton</a>, became one of the first African Americans to earn a college degree.
The four years Templeton spent at Ohio University, in which he compiled a superior academic record and became an active member of the <a>Athenian Literary Society</a>, are chronicled in the stage play <em><a>Free Man of Color</a></em> by <a>Charles Smith</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, Alumni Gateway was dedicated on the College Green, inscribed with words borrowed from the Latin inscription above the main portal to the ancient university of Padua, Italy.
In 1975, Ohio University opened the College of Osteopathic Medicine, which remains the only college in Ohio to award the <em>Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine</em> degree.
Today the university is known for its strong journalism and visual communication programs, as well as its <a>Avionics Engineering</a> Center.
The Avionics Engineering Center, part of the Russ College of Engineering and Technology, specializes in the research, development, and evaluation of electronic navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.
The center, the largest at Ohio University, was established in 1963 to support a combination of theoreticians, technical specialists and graduate students to study navigation issues encountered in air transportation.
This University is also well-known in <a>Malaysia</a> for its ties with <a>MARA University of Technology</a> in the 1980s.</p>

It was named by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> as a Doctoral/High Research Activity institution to reflect its growing number of graduate programs.
University libraries contain more than 3 million bound volumes.</p>
In 2006, twelve Ohio University students received <a>Fulbright</a> scholarships.
In both 2004 and 2005, Ohio University had 9 Fulbright Scholars, besting the university's previous record of six awards..</p>
<p>Other awards received by recent Ohio University students include the <a>Marshall Scholarship</a>, the Mitchell Scholarship, the Truman Scholarship, <a>Morris K. Udall</a> Scholarship, and the <a>Goldwater</a> Scholarship and Hollings Scholarship, which were won by the same student during the 2005-2006 academic year.</p>
<p>A variety of research programs and institutes bring top practitioners who provide students with opportunities to work with and learn from world-class scientists and scholars actively engaged in advancing their disciplines.</p>

<h3>Scripps College of Communication</h3>
<p>The Ohio University Scripps College of Communication, on October 5, 2010, was named Ohio's first Center of Excellence in the Cultural and Societal Transformation category .
The college is made up of five schools and one research lab: <a>The E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a>, <a>The J. W. McClure School of Information and Telecommunication Systems</a>,  <a>The School of Communication Studies</a>, <a>The School of Media Arts and Studies</a> (formerly the School of Telecommunications), <a>The School of Visual Communication</a>, and the <a>Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab</a>.</p>
<p><a>Fox News</a> Chairman and CEO <a>Roger Ailes</a> gave a sizeable donation to Ohio University for a renovated student newsroom.
The new facility, set to open in spring of 2010, will double the size of the university's existing newsroom - last upgraded in the 1960s - and allow more students to participate in the school's WOUB radio station and television programs.</p>
<p>Ailes majored in radio and television while at Ohio University and served two years as manager of the school's radio station.
Since 1994 he has funded scholarships for Ohio University students in the school's telecommunications programs.</p>
<p>Ailes' fondness for OU is matched by his generosity.
Although the size of the donation was not revealed, it was described as substantial.
The 67-year-old credits the school with making him the successful man he is today.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ohio University ignited my interest in broadcasting, which became my lifetime career.
The education I received there gave me the opportunity to take on my first managerial responsibilities and provided early lessons in leadership.
<p>The newsroom is a small part of a planned $34.4 million integrated communication facility for the college.
<p>One of the flagship programs of Ohio University, the <a>E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a>, is in the Scripps College of Communication.</p>
<p>The School of Visual Communication, also known as VisCom, has been recognized twice as a Program of Excellence by the Ohio Board of Regents.
The school offers students an interdisciplinary visual communication degree in one of four sequences: informational graphics and page design, photojournalism, commercial photography and interactive multimedia.
<p>The GRID Lab, an initiative of Ohio University's Scripps College of Communication, was developed by School of Media Arts and Studies faculty and staff to provide the Appalachian Ohio region with training, education, and an opportunity to develop technical and creative skills with digital game technology.
<p>The GRID Lab&#x2019;s research laboratory opened in September 2005 made possible through a grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission and other university and community partners.
Since 2005, the GRID Lab has been awarded numerous grants and contracts from state and federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Central Ohio Urban Area Security Initiative, the Ohio Board of Regents, and the National Institutes of Health.
<p>The focus of the Lab is the research and development of serious and educational games, simulations, computer animation, and virtual reality.
<h3>College of Business</h3>
<p>In 2011, Ohio University's College of Business was ranked 60th in the nation by Business Week.
Despite University measures to increase enrollment, the CoB prides itself on staying smaller than other business schools.
<p>The Accountancy school uses the Business Activity Model (&quot;BAM&quot;) in its intermediate classes.
One of the authors of BAM, Connie Esmond-Kiger, was named Director of the School of Accountancy in Fall 2007.
She is also the adviser for OU's chapter of Beta Alpha Psi, the financial majors fraternity.
<p>The CoB's Student Equity Management Group, which was started in 2003, was afforded $1 million from the University to invest.
Since inception, the Student Equity Management Group's portfolio has increased by 51.29%, beating the S&amp;P 500 by 42.61% in that period.</p>
Many business students strongly prefer to study and work in Copeland instead of the library.</p>
<p>The CoB requires students take five classes in the cluster format.
The students then receive a grade in all five of their classes on the project.
<p>The Ohio University <a>College of Education</a> has a long and rich history dating back to May 11, 1886, with the founding of a Normal Department at Ohio University.
The Normal Department &#x2013; the predecessor to today&#x2019;s College of Education &#x2013; was the first state-supported teacher preparation program in Ohio.
The state&#x2019;s first kindergarten opened on the Ohio University campus in 1907.
<p><a>250px|thumb|right|Stocker Center, The Russ College of Engineering</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|Kennedy Museum of Art</a> <a>thumb|250px|35 Park Place, home of the Honors Tutorial College</a></p>
It is named in honor of Dr. Fritz J. Russ, an alumnus in electrical engineering and the founder of Systems Research Laboratories, a major bioengineering concern.</p>
<p>The Russ' left the college that bears their name approximately $91.8 million in real estate and securities, though details of how the money will be spent has yet to be determined.</p>
<h3>College of Fine Arts and Kennedy Museum of Art</h3>
<p>The Ohio University College of Fine Arts aspires to educate artists and scholars to articulate and express themselves through intellectual examination, participatory training, and research practice.
The College's approach to education is diverse, dynamic, and international providing an environment rich and deep with opportunities for expression.</p>
<p>The University's marching band, <a>The Ohio University Marching 110</a>, also known as &quot;The Most Exciting Band In The Land,&quot; is based out of the College of Fine Arts, and is currently under the direction of Dr. Richard Suk, Associate Director of Bands.
The band has a very rich history and is very proud of the traditions that have been built.
<p>The Kennedy Museum of Art, named to honor Edwin L. and Ruth E. Kennedy, is housed at the Ridges in historic Lin Hall.
This exceptional institution offers a wide array of exhibitions, a line-up of educational offerings, tours, and more.</p>
Programs of study in the School emphasize an accommodating learning atmosphere that promotes high academic standards and a commitment to encouraging an active and healthy lifestyle.
The School is dedicated to creating, improving, and propagating theoretical and practical information through its distinct programs.</p>
<p>The <a>Honors Tutorial College</a> at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio is the only degree-granting tutorial program in the United States.
<p>The program generally accepts around eighty students per year from an applicant pool of around two hundred and offers programs in twenty-seven disciplines, from journalism to astrophysics.
<p>The college was officially founded in 1972, although an Honors College had existed previously since 1964.</p>
The school is built around three areas: (i) Entrepeneurship and Regional Development, (ii) Policy Innovation and Strategic Leadership, and (iii) Energy and the Environment.
In each area, students, faculty, and professional staff participate in a model of multidisciplinary education, blending rigorous classroom instruction and scholarship with applied service to the region, state, and nation.
They maintain strong rivalries with the other MAC schools in Ohio, particularly <a>Miami University</a>.</p>
<p>The long and storied tradition of Ohio Bobcats <a>football</a> began in 1894 with an 8-0 loss to <a>Marietta College</a>.
Since that day, the Bobcats have posted a 485-503-48 record over their 112 year existence and a 191-232-12 record over their 60 years in the Mid-American Conference.
In 1960, the Bobcats were crowned National Small College Champions after compiling a 10-0 record under Coach Bill Hess.
The Bobcats have appeared in five bowl games, losing 14-15 to <a>West Texas State</a> in the 1962 <a>Sun Bowl</a>, losing 42-49 to <a>Richmond</a> in the 1968 <a>Tangerine Bowl</a>, falling to <a>Southern Mississippi</a> 28-7 in the 2007 <a>GMAC Bowl</a>, succumbing 21-17 to the <a>Marshall Thundering Herd</a> and most recently getting destroyed by Troy University 48-21 in the R and L Carriers Bowl in New Orleans.
<p>Under the guidance of Frank Solich, the Ohio football program has a return to prominence in 2006.
On November 16, 2006, the Bobcats secured their first ever <a>Mid-American Conference</a> East Division title and their first football championship of any sort since 1968 with a victory over the <a>University of Akron</a> <a>Zips</a>.
On January 7, 2007, the Bobcats were the MAC representative to the <a>GMAC Bowl</a> in <a>Mobile, Alabama</a>, losing 28-7 to <a>The University of Southern Mississippi</a> <a>Golden Eagles</a> in a game nationally televised on <a>ESPN</a>.</p>
The Bobcats have won 5 Mid-American Conference tournament titles in 1983, 1985, 1994, 2005, and 2010 as well as 9 MAC regular season titles in 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1985, and 1994.
The Bobcats have been selected for the <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> 4 times in 1941 (finalist), 1969, 1986, and 1995, while also appearing in the <a>College Basketball Invitational</a> in 2008.
As a result of the storied tradition of Ohio Bobcats basketball, the program was ranked 86th in <em>Street &amp; Smith's 100 Greatest Basketball Programs of All Time</em>, published in 2005.</p>
The Aquatic Center, one of the finest swimming and diving facilities in the league and in the nation, has hosted numerous MAC Women's Swimming and Diving Tournaments.
Recent graduate Jake Percival was a four time All-American.
Current head coach Joe Carbone was part of the only College World Series team in Ohio history (1970), and has had a MAC championship twice in his 20 years as head coach.
The <a>Convocation Center</a>, home of Bobcats basketball, volleyball, and wrestling, is also a great facility.
The largest basketball arena in the MAC, and one of the largest in the state, the Convo's hostile environment has allowed the Bobcats to win over 75% of their games in the facility.
<p>Ohio University is also home to the nationally-acclaimed <a>Ohio University Marching 110</a> marching band which continually draws crowds at the Bobcat football and basketball games.
On October 28, 1976, the Marching 110 became the first marching band in history to perform at <a>Carnegie Hall</a>.
On January 20, 1993, the band performed for <a>President Clinton's</a> Presidential Inauguration in Washington, DC.
Though being a member of a club sport is not as serious as being a member of a <a>varsity sport</a>, it does take commitment and dedication.
The difference between each tier is the importance of the sport.
The higher tier the sport is in, the more money that the team receives from the school and also the higher priority that team gets.
Forms due for each club sport consist of Excellence/developmental funding request, club sports re-registration, campus life re-registration, end of the year report, treasurer&#x2019;s report, quarterly practice and traveling schedules, <a>roster</a>, <a>budget</a>, and electronic copy of team&#x2019;s <a>bylaws</a> and <a>constitution</a>.
Meetings that members of each team must attend consist of General Session, End of the Year Business Meeting, New Offices Training, Club Sports Annual Awards Banquet and Presidents workshops.</p>
<p> The John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after John Calhoun Baker, the 14th president of Ohio University.
The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green.
<p>The five-story facility has been praised for its visual appeal.
The building features <a>Georgian-style architecture</a> and expansive windows throughout that offer spectacular views of campus and allow a great deal of natural light to enter.
In contrast to the exterior's red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high ceilings, ergonomic furniture and a color scheme of sage, plum and mocha.
The building&#x2019;s planners aimed to connect the campus with the design and structure of the student center by incorporating an escalator system (the only one in Athens County), which cuts through the main atrium of the building and connects the upper and lower portions of campus.
<p>Baker University Center contains a large food court (West 82), a fine dining restaurant (Latitude 39), a Ballroom, a bookstore and student shop (Bobcat Essentials), a theater, study areas, computer labs, a billiards lounge, administrative offices and numerous conference rooms.
The Front Room, a large coffee house serving Starbucks products and bakery items, is housed on the fourth floor and opens onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Street, making it a hot spot for students between classes.
Other amenities include a United States Post Office, the Trisolini art gallery and a tech depot that sells computer and accessories and offers students tech help.</p>
<p>The design of the facility has garnered several honors.
In 2007, Baker University Center won two <a>Golden Trowel awards</a> from the International Masonry Institute, including the grand prize of Best Project in Ohio for its <a>terrazzo floor art</a> and another prize for its <a>distinctive interior masonry features</a>.
In 2008, Baker University Center was awarded the grand prize with honors from <a>Learning by Design</a>, an organization that recognizes excellence in educational facilities.
The facility also earned the <a>2008 Facility Design Award</a> from the Association of College Unions International, which annually distinguishes excellence in the design of student unions and other student-centered building on college campuses.</p>
Event Services, which coordinates events held in the facility as well as in other venues on campus, is headed by Associate Director Kristin Stanley, Assistant Directors Nikki Ohms and Caitlin Barnhardt, and Reservations Coordinator Jennifer Coen.
The Guest Services department is headed by Lureen Bailey, administrative assistant, and the Event Services Administration department is headed by Tim Epley, business manager, and Judy Martin, administrative assistant.
A number of students support each of the above departments in various contexts.
<p>Baker University Center has a variety of <a>spaces</a> that can be reserved by students, student organizations, university affiliates and external users.
<p>Vernon R. Alden Library serves the Athens campus as the central library facility; the building can seat 3,000 people.
The collection of the Ohio University library contains over 2.3 million units of microfilm material, 13,500 periodical subscriptions and 3 million printed volumes</p>
<p><strong>&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;</strong> Edwin Watts Chubb was acting president for one year in 1920 when President Ellis died and again in 1934 when President Bryan died.</p>
<p>The University Mascot is 'Rufus' the bobcat.
In 2006, Ohio University alumus Michael A Massa formally suggested to the university that the university provide a proper name and identity to the generic bobcat mascot.
The university held a university-wide competition to select a name and 'Rufus' was the popular choice.
<p> Ohio University is known in state folklore as the most haunted college campus in the entire United States, if not the world.
Established in 1804, the university is quite old by Ohio's standards, which only adds to its ghostly reputation.
<p>The <a>British Society for Psychical Research</a> claims that Athens, Ohio, is one of the most haunted places in the world.
Fox at one point also taped an episode of its <em><a>Scariest Places On Earth</a></em> program at OU.</p>
<p>Many of the ghost stories associated with Athens and the University center around the former <a>Athens Lunatic Asylum</a> and the horrors that supposedly went on there.
Two notable examples of alleged local hauntings are a statue of an angel in the cemetery on West State St which is said to be crying, and the spirit of a civil war veteran called Michael Ward, who chants names of the university's students.</p>
