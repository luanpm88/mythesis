The residential learning community emphasizes an arts culture that crosses the boundaries of the majors and disciplines within the Arts.
Each team is student run, which means that there are many positions that students need to fill but also be trained in.
It is extremely important that each student take their role seriously because paper work and deadlines are mandatory and can lead a team to being suspended or fined.
Each team can choose to move up a tier if they feel their members can meet that tier&#x2019;s standards.
