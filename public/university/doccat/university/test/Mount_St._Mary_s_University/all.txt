established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Mount St. Mary's University</strong>, also known as <em>The Mount</em>, is a private, <a>liberal arts</a>, <a>Catholic</a> university in the <a>Catoctin Mountain</a>s near <a>Emmitsburg, Maryland</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was founded by French &#x00e9;migr&#x00e9; Father <a>John DuBois</a> in 1808 and is the oldest independent Catholic college in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%(It is the second oldest Catholic college in the United States, after <a>Georgetown</a>.)
established$$$@@@%%%The school became co-educational in 1972.
faculty$$$@@@%%%In addition to its <a>undergraduate</a> school, the university includes five <a>graduate</a> programs, including a <a>seminary</a>.
president$$$@@@%%%Dr. Thomas Powell is the University's president.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The seminary's rector and president is the former vicar general of the Catholic Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, Monsignor <a>Stephen P. Rohlfs</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Rohlfs's immediate predecessor as rector and president was Bishop <a>Kevin C. Rhoades</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The chancellor of the seminary is the former Archbishop <a>William Henry Keeler</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1805, DuBois laid the cornerstone for a church Saint-Mary's-on-the-Hill and bought land with the intention of constructing a school.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1809, Pigeon Hall, a seminary of the <a>Society of St. Sulpice</a> was transferred to Emmitsburg and marked the beginning of higher education at Mount St. Mary.
established$$$@@@%%%In the same year, <a>Elizabeth Ann Seton</a>, <a>saint</a> and founder of the <a>Sisters of Charity</a>, came to the Mount.
established$$$@@@%%%She attended Mass there until her death in 1821.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first charter for a university was obtained in 1830.
established$$$@@@%%%However, until the early 1900s, Mount Saint Mary's University also acted as a <a>boarding school</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Some remnants of the boarding school, such as Bradley Hall (one of the oldest buildings on campus), still exist.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<h3>Merger with St. Joseph's College</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>&lt;!---would like to pipe trick this down to something smaller but don't know how---&gt; &lt;!---may be too long---&gt; In June 1809, <a>Elizabeth Ann Seton</a> (later canonized as the first American Saint) had arrived in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and established the first parochial school for girls in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%Over the years, that school grew to become Saint Joseph College, a four-year liberal arts college for women.
established$$$@@@%%%However, due to sagging enrollment numbers and rising operating costs, Saint Joseph College closed its doors and ceased operations in 1973.
established$$$@@@%%%Students and faculty were merged with Mount Saint Mary&#x2019;s University.</p>

country$$$@@@%%%<h3>National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The National Shrine Grotto of Lourdes draws hundreds of thousands of religious pilgrims and tourists to the campus of Mount Saint Mary's University annually.
established$$$@@@%%%It is the oldest known replica of the revered French shrine, dating to about 1875, less than twenty years after the original <a>Lourdes</a> apparitions.
established$$$@@@%%%The Grotto has been in use since 1805 when the university's founder Father John DuBois chose it as a place of prayer and devotion.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Simon Brut&#x00e9;, who later became the first bishop of <a>Vincennes, Indiana</a>, was an important early steward of the Grotto, beginning to care for the site in 1812.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Grotto was proclaimed a Public <a>Oratory</a> on December 8, 1965, by Cardinal <a>Lawrence Shehan</a>, archbishop of <a>Baltimore</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Hugh J. Phillips, who had formerly been a student and then president of the university, was appointed its chaplain.
established$$$@@@%%%The library at Mount Saint Mary's is named in his honor.
president$$$@@@%%%He is succeeded by the current chaplain, Father William B. Kauffman.</p>

image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>Student publications</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first issues of the Mountain Echo appear to have been published in 1879 and 1880, from Inglewood, near Mt.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%St. Mary&#x2032;s University, Emmitsburg, MD.
established$$$@@@%%%According to a 1993 article in The Mountaineer Briefing by Dr. William Lawbaugh, these numbers were printed on a hand-operated press by Professor Ernest Lagarde from his home, which he named Inglewood.
established$$$@@@%%%The Mountaineer, which functioned both as a college newspaper and alumni journal, was also published sporadically during the latter part of the 1800s, and began regular publication in 1893.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On October 28, 1923, the editors of the revived Mountain Echo published Volume I, Number 1, taking for themselves the responsibility to report on news and issues of concern to the College community, while The Mountaineer was to be devoted to alumni news and literary pursuits.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Noting that &#x2033;this is the age of speed when news are flashed across the continent with the speed of thought,&#x2033; the editors saw the need for a weekly paper to report on current events in a fast changing world.
established$$$@@@%%%For the yearly subscription price of three dollars, alumni received both publications, and were thus kept informed of college activities and issues as well as those of other graduates.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>Early issues of the newspaper were four pages each, and reported on significant campus events, sports, and education.
website$$$@@@%%%The issues also contained death notices, news from classes and alumni, campus changes, personals, and advertisements.
established$$$@@@%%%The 1878/1880 issues featured poetry, literary works, and articles on the history of the College.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the academic year 1974/1975, the paper was restructured under the name of The Mountain Review, but resumed its long-standing name the following year.
established$$$@@@%%%By the 1995/1996 academic year The Mountain Echo was printing a 24 page issue on a biweekly schedule.
established$$$@@@%%%That year the Echo also had expanded into other formats with Echo Online, which was the first incarnation of The Mountain Echo website, as well as Echo Weekly News with Vince Chesney, which was a radio show hosted by the newspaper's editor-in-chief on the college radio station, WMTB.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although the internet company that maintained Echo Online folded within a few years, The Mountain Echo would reemerge in cyberspace in 2002 with a new internet provider.
established$$$@@@%%%Since that resurrection, The Mountain Echo has been both in print and online each week.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Athletics</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> On March 18, 2008, the Mountaineers defeated <a>Coppin State University</a> in the <a>play-in game</a> of the <a>NCAA Tournament</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This win was Mount Saint Mary's first as a <a>Division I</a> school in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Babe Ruth</a> was discovered at Mount St. Mary's by <a>Joe Engel</a>, a student and <a>baseball</a> <a>player</a> at the school, when the St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys of Baltimore (which Ruth attended) team came to Emmitsburg to play.
established$$$@@@%%%Engel informed <a>minor-league</a> <a>Baltimore Orioles</a> manager Jack Dunn of Ruth and his prodigious pitching ability.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Connection to the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College in South Bend, IN</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> In 1834 <a>Simon Brut&#x00e9;</a> was appointed the founding bishop of the <a>Diocese of Vincennes</a>, modern day <a>Indiana</a> and Eastern <a>Illinois</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%His experience of developing Mount Saint Mary's would have been highly prized as Notre Dame was being formed.
established$$$@@@%%%Like the Mount, in its early years Notre Dame was a university in name only.
established$$$@@@%%%It encompassed religious novitiates, preparatory and grade schools and a manual labor school, but its classical collegiate curriculum never attracted more than a dozen students a year in the early decades.
established$$$@@@%%%This is a model that Brut&#x00e9; could have impressed on the <a>Holy Cross Brothers</a> who founded the university.
established$$$@@@%%%Again, there is a French connection in the <a>Congregation of the Holy Cross</a> and Brut&#x00e9; who both held deep devotion to the <a>Blessed Virgin Mary</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%While Brut&#x00e9; was a modest man, leaving no published works behind, his influence can be seen in the <a>University of Notre Dame</a> and its sister school <a>Saint Mary's College</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>There is the obvious parallel between the three school's names (Notre Dame is 'Our Lady,' a term of endearment for Saint Mary).
established$$$@@@%%%Second, and less obvious is a parallel between the three school's mottos.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Mount Saint Mary's in Emmitsburg has the motto 'Spes Nostra' (Latin: Our Hope) similar to Saint Mary's College in Indiana's motto '<a>Spes Unica</a>' (Latin: the Only/Unique Hope) and Notre Dame's motto 'Vita Dulcedo Spes' (Latin: Life, Sweetness, Hope).
mascot$$$@@@%%%Mount Saint Mary's in Emmitsburg, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's in Indiana are all unique in their use of focusing on their patron's attribute of a Catholic's hope.</p>
