type$$$@@@%%%Established in 1885, it is one of the oldest universities in South Korea, the top private comprehensive university in South Korea, and is widely regarded as one of the top three comprehensive universities in the country.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2010, Yonsei University was ranked the 19th best university in Asia, and globally rose 9 positions to rank #142 by QS World University rankings 2010, and 190th in the world by <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was formally established in January, 1957 through the union of <em><a>Yonhi College</a></em> (&#xc5f0;&#xd76c;&#xc804;&#xbb38;&#xd559;&#xad50;; &#x5ef6;&#x79a7;&#x5c08;&#x9580;&#x5b78;&#x6821;) and <a>Severance Union Medical College</a> (&#xc138;&#xbe0c;&#xb780;&#xc2a4; &#xc758;&#xacfc;&#xb300;&#xd559;; &#xc138;&#xbe0c;&#xb780;&#xc2a4; &#x91ab;&#x79d1;&#x5927;&#x5b78;).
established$$$@@@%%%This was a result of a lasting bilateral cooperation between the two colleges which had begun in the 1920s.
established$$$@@@%%%The institutions were new to Korea at the time of their inception &mdash; <em>Yonhi College</em> was one of the first modern colleges, founded originally as <em>Chosun Christian College</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xae30;&#xb3c5;&#xad50;&#xb300;&#xd559;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x57fa;&#x7763;&#x6559;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) in March, 1915, and Severance has its roots in the first modern medical center in Korea, <em>Gwanghyewon</em> (&#xad11;&#xd61c;&#xc6d0; &#x5ee3;&#x60e0;&#x9662;, House of Extended Grace), founded in April, 1885.
established$$$@@@%%%As a tribute, the name 'Yonsei' was derived from the first syllables of the names of its two parent institutions, 'Yon; &#xc5f0;; &#x5ef6;' from <em>Yonhi College</em> and 'Sei; &#xc138;; &#x4e16;' from Severance Union Medical College.

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
city$$$@@@%%%<h3>Beginnings (1885 - 1916)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Yonsei University Medical School dates back to April 10, 1885, when the first modern hospital to practice <a>western medicine</a> in Korea, <em>Gwanghyewon</em>, was established.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The hospital was founded by <a>Horace Newton Allen</a>, the <a>American</a> <a>protestant</a> <a>missionary</a> appointed to Korea by the <a>Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A</a> (from here on <em>the Church</em>).
established$$$@@@%%%The hospital was renamed <em>Jejungwon</em> (&#xc81c;&#xc911;&#xc6d0; &#x6fdf;&#x8846;&#x9662;, House of Universal Helpfulness) on April 23.
established$$$@@@%%%As there appeared numerous difficulties, the Church appointed Oliver R. Avison to run <em>Jejungwon</em> on July 16, 1893.
established$$$@@@%%%Initially, <em>Gwanghyewon</em> was financed by the Korean government, while the medical staff was provided by the Church.
established$$$@@@%%%However, by 1894 when the <a>First Sino-Japanese War</a> and <a>Gabo reforms</a> (&#xac11;&#xc624;&#xac1c;&#xd601;) took place, the government was not able to continue its financial support and thus, management of <em>Jejungwon</em> now came fully under the Church.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1899 Avison returned to the U.S. and attended a conference of missionaries in <a>New York</a> where he elaborated on the medical project in Korea.
established$$$@@@%%%Louis H. Sevrance, a businessman and philanthropist from <a>Cleveland</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, was present and deeply moved.
nickname$$$@@@%%%He later paid for the major portion of the construction cost of new buildings for the medical facility.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>Jejungwon</em> (&#xc81c;&#xc911;&#xc6d0;) was renamed <a>Severance Hospital</a> in his name.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><em>Jejungwon</em> (later <a>Severance Hospital</a>) was primarily a hospital but it also performed medical education as an attachment.
established$$$@@@%%%The hospital admitted its first class of 16 medical students selected through examinations in 1886, one year after its establishment.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1899, Jejungwon Medical School was independently and officially recognized.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the increase of diversity in missionary denominations in Korea, collaboration began to form &mdash; with time, <em>Jejungwon</em> began to receive medical staff, school faculty and financial support from the Union Council of Korean Missionaries (&#xd55c;&#xad6d;&#xc5f0;&#xd569;&#xc120;&#xad50;&#xd611;&#xc758;&#xd68c;; &#x97d3;&#x570b;&#x806f;&#x5408;&#x5ba3;&#x654e;&#x5354;&#x8b70;&#x6703;) in 1912.
established$$$@@@%%%Accordingly, the medical school was renamed Severance Union Medical College in 1913.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The rest of Yonsei University traces its origins to <em>Chosun</em> Christian College, which was founded on March 5, 1915, by another American Protestant missionary sent by the Church, <a>Horace Grant Underwood</a>.
president$$$@@@%%%Underwood became the first president, and Avison vice president.
former_names$$$@@@%%%It was located at the <a>YMCA</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Courses began in April with 60 students and 18 faculty members.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Underwood died of illness on October 12, 1916, and Avison took over as president.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<h3>Under Japanese Rule(I) (1917 - 1936)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|100px|Statue of Underwood</a>  On August 22, 1910, <a>Japan annexed Korea</a> with the <a>Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The first <a>Governor-General of Korea</a>, <a>Terauchi Masatake</a>, introduced <em>Ordinance on Chosun Education</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xad50;&#xc721;&#xb839;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x654e;&#x80b2;&#x4ee4;) in 1911, and subsequently <em>Regulations on Professional Schools</em> (&#xc804;&#xbb38;&#xd559;&#xad50; &#xaddc;&#xce59;) and <em>Revised Regulations on Private Schools</em> (&#xac1c;&#xc815;&#xc0ac;&#xb9bd;&#xd559;&#xad50; &#xaddc;&#xce59;) in March, 1915.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%These were intended to stifle private education in Korea; any establishment of schools, any change in school regulations, location, its purpose, coursework or textbooks must all be reported to and authorized by the governor-general, and all courses must be in Japanese.
established$$$@@@%%%Severance Union College struggled to meet these requirements; school regulations and coursework were altered, faculty evaluated and enlarged, its foundation and its board clarified.
established$$$@@@%%%It received its recognition as a professional medical school on May 14, 1917.
image_size$$$@@@%%%In 1922 the governor-general <a>Makoto Saito</a> issued <em>Revised Ordinance on Chosun Education</em> (&#xac1c;&#xc815;&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xad50;&#xc721;&#xb839;).
established$$$@@@%%%It called for more strict qualification of the faculty, and Severance reacted obediently and further recruited more members with degrees from credited institutions in North America and Europe.
established$$$@@@%%%Japan did not completely ignore the competence of this institution; in 1923 Severance recovered its right to give medical license to its graduates without state examination, a right which had been lost since 1912.
established$$$@@@%%%Moreover in March, 1934, <a>Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture</a> further recognized Severance in allowing its graduates the right to practice medicine anywhere within Japanese sovereignty.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Oh Geung Seon</a> (&#xc624;&#xacbd;&#xc120;; &#x5433;&#x5162;&#x5584;) became the first Korean president of Severance in 1934.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Underwood Hall, which houses administrative offices</a>Ordinances in 1915 and 1922 also affected the fate of Chosun Christian College.
state$$$@@@%%%First intended as a college, it was not legally recognized as such, since the <em>Ordinance</em> (1915) did not allow the establishment of Korean private colleges.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence Chosun Christian College, now renamed Yonhi College, was formally accepted only as a <em>professional school</em> on April 17, 1917, then a joint project from diverse missionary denominations.
established$$$@@@%%%However, Yonhi in reality had formed the organization and faculty becoming a university; it consisted 6 departments: humanities, agriculture, commerce, theology (this department did not open due to the differences among the founding denominations), mathematics &amp; physics, and applied chemistry.
established$$$@@@%%%The ordinances, furthermore, prohibited coursework in <a>Korean history</a>, <a>its geography</a>, or in <a>Bible</a> outside the department of theology; council of missionaries reacted with <em>A Resolution on the Revised Educational Ordinance</em> (&#xac1c;&#xc815;&#xad50;&#xc721;&#xb839;&#xc5d0; &#xad00;&#xd55c; &#xacb0;&#xc758;&#xbb38;) which carefully pointed out that Japan did not apply such rigorous absurdities to its private schools in mainland Japan.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After <a>March First Independence Movement</a> swept the peninsula in 1919, Japan somewhat relaxed its grip on Korea, and this is reflected in the <em>Ordinance</em> (1922).
established$$$@@@%%%It ceased the arbitrary control of governor-general over the coursework and the qualification of faculty members, and altered its stance on strict separation of religion from all education.
established$$$@@@%%%It also recognized Yonhi as a professional school equal to its counterparts in Japan, and permitted the Christian programs and the Bible in its coursework.
established$$$@@@%%%Nevertheless, Japanese literature became mandatory in turn.
established$$$@@@%%%Under Japanese intervention, Korean history was taught under the name Eastern History and Korean language was taught whenever possible.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Department of agriculture was closed after 1922 when only its first graduates left Yonhi.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%There were efforts to revive this department, without much success.
free_label$$$@@@%%%However, Yonhi installed a training center for agricultural leaders on campus, with impressive results.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Yonhi was liberal in its admission of non-Christians.
established$$$@@@%%%Its policy was to admit non-Christians relatively freely and allow the majority Christian students to gradually influence and assimilate them.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<h3>Under Japanese Rule(II): The War Machine (1937 - 1945)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the late 1930s, Japan again shifted its policy towards Korea in order to incorporate it to its scheme of expansionism.
established$$$@@@%%%In August, 1936, the new Japanese Governor-General <a>Jir&#x014d; Minami</a> began the assimilation of Koreans, in order to exploit them for military purposes; Governor-General enforced <a>S&#x014d;shi-kaimei</a> and <a>Shintoism</a> on Koreans, and began to recruit Koreans for Japanese war efforts.
established$$$@@@%%%In April,1938 the third <em>Ordinance on Chosun Education</em> ordered the acceptance of Shintoism, voluntary removal of Korean language in coursework and further intensification of Japanese and Japanese history education.
established$$$@@@%%%However, Yonhi Professional School did not follow suit and opened courses on the study of Korean language in November, 1938.
established$$$@@@%%%This was not tolerated for long and in March, 1940, Yonhi was forced to open courses on Japanese studies for each department and each year.
established$$$@@@%%%From 1938, English also began to come under pressure following a deterioration of relations between Japan and United States; coursework in English was forbidden and texts of English writers were censored.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1938, President H.H. Underwood accepted the practice of Shintoism to avoid the fate of Yonhi's termination.
country$$$@@@%%%Governors-General pushed Yonhi to refuse financial support from United States and financial difficulties amounted.
established$$$@@@%%%&lt;/br&gt;On individual level, Yonhi faculty members and its students were apprehended or investigated during this period for their involvement in real and alleged resistance movements.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1939, the United States government recalled all its citizens and missionaries in Korea; Underwood and some of the faculty refused to leave Korea until forced to in 1941-1942 following the outbreak of the <a>pacific war</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Japanese military officers were dispatched in Yonhi for military training of its students in 1940 and forced labor began in 1941.
established$$$@@@%%%Scientific equipments, building parts, and even the Underwood statue were seized then the school yard was turned into drill ground.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to their value in the time of war, medical students of Severance were not a target of &quot;voluntary recruitment,&quot; but Severance also faced S&#x014d;shi-kaimei, military training, and constant surveillance by the Japanese authorities.
established$$$@@@%%%Severance was coerced into changing its name to Asahi(&#x65ed;) in 1942.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On August 17, 1942, the board was dismissed and Yonhi was designated as enemy property, and thus was appropriated and further managed directly by an appointee from the Governors-General.
established$$$@@@%%%Yonhi ceased to be a place of education and was converted into a tool for assimilation of Koreans and exploitation of manpower.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%By October, 1943, students were practically being conscripted.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1944 dormitories were converted into barracks and campus was occupied by the Japanese air force.
established$$$@@@%%%Finally, on May 10, 1944, Governors-General closed Yonhi and replaced it with <em>Kyungsung</em> Industrial Management School (&#xacbd;&#xc131;&#xacf5;&#xc5c5;&#xacbd;&#xc601;&#xd559;&#xad50;), the primary purpose of which was to train engineers required to continue the war.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Resistance against Japanese rules</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Both Severance and Yonhi were closely involved in <a>Korean independence movements</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Many faculty members of Severance and Yonhi were directly involved in the March First Independence Movement, as were their students.
established$$$@@@%%%Severance continued its contribution by printing <em>The Independence</em> in the basement of one of its buildings, and Yonhi was as active as any other school, so that by the end of the movement only 17 students were left.
established$$$@@@%%%Yonhi students were active participants of Chosun Student Council for Scientific Research (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xd559;&#xc0dd;&#xacfc;&#xd559;&#xc5f0;&#xad6c;&#xd68c;), which was one of the leading groups in the <a>Mansei Movement</a> of June 10, 1926.
established$$$@@@%%%Yonhi Student Council and many faculty members belonging to the clandestine <a>Shin Gan Society</a> (&#xc2e0;&#xac04;&#xd68c; &#x65b0;&#x5e79;&#x6703;) gave full support to the <a>Gwangju Student Movement</a>; in the aftermath, students were apprehended, and Shin Gan Society was exposed.
established$$$@@@%%%Later on, students actively participated in V Narod (&#xbe0c;&#xb098;&#xb85c;&#xb4dc;) and Student Enlightenment Movement (&#xd559;&#xc0dd;&#xacc4;&#xbabd;&#xc6b4;&#xb3d9;) during 1929 - 1930.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Yonhi School, under Japanese oppression in 1940s, still kept producing Korean patriots fought for Korean independence.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1942, the Japanese Colonial Government of Korea arrested 33 Korean scholars of Korean language including three members of Yonhi School faculty and prominent Korean language scholars, <em>Choi Hyun Bae</em> (&#xcd5c;&#xd604;&#xbc30;; &#x5d14;&#x9249;&#x57f9;), <em>Lee Yun Jae</em> (&#xc774;&#xc724;&#xc7ac;; &#x674e;&#x5141;&#x5bb0;), and <em>Kim Do Yeon</em> (&#x91d1;&#x5ea6;&#x6f14;; &#xae40;&#xb3c4;&#xc5f0;) and other graduates of the school including <em>Jung Tae Jin</em> (&#xc815;&#xd0dc;&#xc9c4;; &#x4e01;&#x6cf0;&#x93ad;) and <em>Kim Yoon Kyung</em> (&#xae40;&#xc724;&#xacbd;; &#x91d1;&#x5141;&#x7d93;) for organizing the <em>Joseon Language Society</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xc5b4;&#xd559;&#xd68c;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x8a9e;&#x5b78;&#x6703;; now <a>Korean Language Society</a>; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#xd559;&#xd68c;; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#x5b78;&#x6703;), studying Korean language, and attempting to publish a Korean language dictionary.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>Lee Yun Jae</em> died in jail in 1942 from torture and harsh treatment, 11 were found guilty, and 5 including <em>Choi Hyun Bae</em> were put to prison.
type$$$@@@%%%The Japanese Colonial Court found them guilty because &quot;behaviors such as publishing of a Korean language dictionary is a form of nationality movement to maintain the spirit of Joseon.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Also, <em><a>Yun Dong-ju</a></em> (&#xc724;&#xb3d9;&#xc8fc;; &#x5c39;&#x6771;&#x67f1;), a 1941 graduate of Yonhi School, joined the Korean independence movement, left many poems about patriotism and self-reflection, imprisoned by Japaneses, and died from torture and harsh treatment in 1944.
