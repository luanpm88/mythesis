<p><strong>Yonsei University</strong> (&#xc5f0;&#xc138;&#xb300;&#xd559;&#xad50;; &#x5ef6;&#x4e16;&#x5927;&#x5b78;&#x6821;) () abbreviated as Yondae (&#xc5f0;&#xb300; Yondae) is a private research university, located in <a>Seoul</a>, <a>South Korea</a>.
In 2010, Yonsei University was ranked the 19th best university in Asia, and globally rose 9 positions to rank #142 by QS World University rankings 2010, and 190th in the world by <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>.
<p>The university was formally established in January, 1957 through the union of <em><a>Yonhi College</a></em> (&#xc5f0;&#xd76c;&#xc804;&#xbb38;&#xd559;&#xad50;; &#x5ef6;&#x79a7;&#x5c08;&#x9580;&#x5b78;&#x6821;) and <a>Severance Union Medical College</a> (&#xc138;&#xbe0c;&#xb780;&#xc2a4; &#xc758;&#xacfc;&#xb300;&#xd559;; &#xc138;&#xbe0c;&#xb780;&#xc2a4; &#x91ab;&#x79d1;&#x5927;&#x5b78;).
This was a result of a lasting bilateral cooperation between the two colleges which had begun in the 1920s.
The institutions were new to Korea at the time of their inception &mdash; <em>Yonhi College</em> was one of the first modern colleges, founded originally as <em>Chosun Christian College</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xae30;&#xb3c5;&#xad50;&#xb300;&#xd559;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x57fa;&#x7763;&#x6559;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) in March, 1915, and Severance has its roots in the first modern medical center in Korea, <em>Gwanghyewon</em> (&#xad11;&#xd61c;&#xc6d0; &#x5ee3;&#x60e0;&#x9662;, House of Extended Grace), founded in April, 1885.
As a tribute, the name 'Yonsei' was derived from the first syllables of the names of its two parent institutions, 'Yon; &#xc5f0;; &#x5ef6;' from <em>Yonhi College</em> and 'Sei; &#xc138;; &#x4e16;' from Severance Union Medical College.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Yonsei University Medical School dates back to April 10, 1885, when the first modern hospital to practice <a>western medicine</a> in Korea, <em>Gwanghyewon</em>, was established.
<p>The hospital was founded by <a>Horace Newton Allen</a>, the <a>American</a> <a>protestant</a> <a>missionary</a> appointed to Korea by the <a>Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A</a> (from here on <em>the Church</em>).
The hospital was renamed <em>Jejungwon</em> (&#xc81c;&#xc911;&#xc6d0; &#x6fdf;&#x8846;&#x9662;, House of Universal Helpfulness) on April 23.
As there appeared numerous difficulties, the Church appointed Oliver R. Avison to run <em>Jejungwon</em> on July 16, 1893.
Initially, <em>Gwanghyewon</em> was financed by the Korean government, while the medical staff was provided by the Church.
However, by 1894 when the <a>First Sino-Japanese War</a> and <a>Gabo reforms</a> (&#xac11;&#xc624;&#xac1c;&#xd601;) took place, the government was not able to continue its financial support and thus, management of <em>Jejungwon</em> now came fully under the Church.
In 1899 Avison returned to the U.S. and attended a conference of missionaries in <a>New York</a> where he elaborated on the medical project in Korea.
Louis H. Sevrance, a businessman and philanthropist from <a>Cleveland</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, was present and deeply moved.
<em>Jejungwon</em> (&#xc81c;&#xc911;&#xc6d0;) was renamed <a>Severance Hospital</a> in his name.</p>
<p><em>Jejungwon</em> (later <a>Severance Hospital</a>) was primarily a hospital but it also performed medical education as an attachment.
The hospital admitted its first class of 16 medical students selected through examinations in 1886, one year after its establishment.
By 1899, Jejungwon Medical School was independently and officially recognized.
Following the increase of diversity in missionary denominations in Korea, collaboration began to form &mdash; with time, <em>Jejungwon</em> began to receive medical staff, school faculty and financial support from the Union Council of Korean Missionaries (&#xd55c;&#xad6d;&#xc5f0;&#xd569;&#xc120;&#xad50;&#xd611;&#xc758;&#xd68c;; &#x97d3;&#x570b;&#x806f;&#x5408;&#x5ba3;&#x654e;&#x5354;&#x8b70;&#x6703;) in 1912.
Accordingly, the medical school was renamed Severance Union Medical College in 1913.</p>
<p>The rest of Yonsei University traces its origins to <em>Chosun</em> Christian College, which was founded on March 5, 1915, by another American Protestant missionary sent by the Church, <a>Horace Grant Underwood</a>.
Courses began in April with 60 students and 18 faculty members.
<p>Underwood died of illness on October 12, 1916, and Avison took over as president.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|100px|Statue of Underwood</a>  On August 22, 1910, <a>Japan annexed Korea</a> with the <a>Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty</a>.
The first <a>Governor-General of Korea</a>, <a>Terauchi Masatake</a>, introduced <em>Ordinance on Chosun Education</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xad50;&#xc721;&#xb839;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x654e;&#x80b2;&#x4ee4;) in 1911, and subsequently <em>Regulations on Professional Schools</em> (&#xc804;&#xbb38;&#xd559;&#xad50; &#xaddc;&#xce59;) and <em>Revised Regulations on Private Schools</em> (&#xac1c;&#xc815;&#xc0ac;&#xb9bd;&#xd559;&#xad50; &#xaddc;&#xce59;) in March, 1915.
Severance Union College struggled to meet these requirements; school regulations and coursework were altered, faculty evaluated and enlarged, its foundation and its board clarified.
It received its recognition as a professional medical school on May 14, 1917.
It called for more strict qualification of the faculty, and Severance reacted obediently and further recruited more members with degrees from credited institutions in North America and Europe.
Japan did not completely ignore the competence of this institution; in 1923 Severance recovered its right to give medical license to its graduates without state examination, a right which had been lost since 1912.
Moreover in March, 1934, <a>Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture</a> further recognized Severance in allowing its graduates the right to practice medicine anywhere within Japanese sovereignty.</p>
<p><a>Oh Geung Seon</a> (&#xc624;&#xacbd;&#xc120;; &#x5433;&#x5162;&#x5584;) became the first Korean president of Severance in 1934.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Underwood Hall, which houses administrative offices</a>Ordinances in 1915 and 1922 also affected the fate of Chosun Christian College.
Hence Chosun Christian College, now renamed Yonhi College, was formally accepted only as a <em>professional school</em> on April 17, 1917, then a joint project from diverse missionary denominations.
However, Yonhi in reality had formed the organization and faculty becoming a university; it consisted 6 departments: humanities, agriculture, commerce, theology (this department did not open due to the differences among the founding denominations), mathematics &amp; physics, and applied chemistry.
The ordinances, furthermore, prohibited coursework in <a>Korean history</a>, <a>its geography</a>, or in <a>Bible</a> outside the department of theology; council of missionaries reacted with <em>A Resolution on the Revised Educational Ordinance</em> (&#xac1c;&#xc815;&#xad50;&#xc721;&#xb839;&#xc5d0; &#xad00;&#xd55c; &#xacb0;&#xc758;&#xbb38;) which carefully pointed out that Japan did not apply such rigorous absurdities to its private schools in mainland Japan.
<p>After <a>March First Independence Movement</a> swept the peninsula in 1919, Japan somewhat relaxed its grip on Korea, and this is reflected in the <em>Ordinance</em> (1922).
It ceased the arbitrary control of governor-general over the coursework and the qualification of faculty members, and altered its stance on strict separation of religion from all education.
It also recognized Yonhi as a professional school equal to its counterparts in Japan, and permitted the Christian programs and the Bible in its coursework.
Nevertheless, Japanese literature became mandatory in turn.
Under Japanese intervention, Korean history was taught under the name Eastern History and Korean language was taught whenever possible.</p>
<p>Department of agriculture was closed after 1922 when only its first graduates left Yonhi.
<p>Yonhi was liberal in its admission of non-Christians.
Its policy was to admit non-Christians relatively freely and allow the majority Christian students to gradually influence and assimilate them.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s, Japan again shifted its policy towards Korea in order to incorporate it to its scheme of expansionism.
In August, 1936, the new Japanese Governor-General <a>Jir&#x014d; Minami</a> began the assimilation of Koreans, in order to exploit them for military purposes; Governor-General enforced <a>S&#x014d;shi-kaimei</a> and <a>Shintoism</a> on Koreans, and began to recruit Koreans for Japanese war efforts.
In April,1938 the third <em>Ordinance on Chosun Education</em> ordered the acceptance of Shintoism, voluntary removal of Korean language in coursework and further intensification of Japanese and Japanese history education.
However, Yonhi Professional School did not follow suit and opened courses on the study of Korean language in November, 1938.
This was not tolerated for long and in March, 1940, Yonhi was forced to open courses on Japanese studies for each department and each year.
From 1938, English also began to come under pressure following a deterioration of relations between Japan and United States; coursework in English was forbidden and texts of English writers were censored.
&lt;/br&gt;On individual level, Yonhi faculty members and its students were apprehended or investigated during this period for their involvement in real and alleged resistance movements.
<p>In 1939, the United States government recalled all its citizens and missionaries in Korea; Underwood and some of the faculty refused to leave Korea until forced to in 1941-1942 following the outbreak of the <a>pacific war</a>.
Japanese military officers were dispatched in Yonhi for military training of its students in 1940 and forced labor began in 1941.
Scientific equipments, building parts, and even the Underwood statue were seized then the school yard was turned into drill ground.
Due to their value in the time of war, medical students of Severance were not a target of &quot;voluntary recruitment,&quot; but Severance also faced S&#x014d;shi-kaimei, military training, and constant surveillance by the Japanese authorities.
Severance was coerced into changing its name to Asahi(&#x65ed;) in 1942.</p>
<p>On August 17, 1942, the board was dismissed and Yonhi was designated as enemy property, and thus was appropriated and further managed directly by an appointee from the Governors-General.
Yonhi ceased to be a place of education and was converted into a tool for assimilation of Koreans and exploitation of manpower.
In 1944 dormitories were converted into barracks and campus was occupied by the Japanese air force.
Finally, on May 10, 1944, Governors-General closed Yonhi and replaced it with <em>Kyungsung</em> Industrial Management School (&#xacbd;&#xc131;&#xacf5;&#xc5c5;&#xacbd;&#xc601;&#xd559;&#xad50;), the primary purpose of which was to train engineers required to continue the war.</p>
<p>Both Severance and Yonhi were closely involved in <a>Korean independence movements</a>.
Many faculty members of Severance and Yonhi were directly involved in the March First Independence Movement, as were their students.
Severance continued its contribution by printing <em>The Independence</em> in the basement of one of its buildings, and Yonhi was as active as any other school, so that by the end of the movement only 17 students were left.
Yonhi students were active participants of Chosun Student Council for Scientific Research (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xd559;&#xc0dd;&#xacfc;&#xd559;&#xc5f0;&#xad6c;&#xd68c;), which was one of the leading groups in the <a>Mansei Movement</a> of June 10, 1926.
Yonhi Student Council and many faculty members belonging to the clandestine <a>Shin Gan Society</a> (&#xc2e0;&#xac04;&#xd68c; &#x65b0;&#x5e79;&#x6703;) gave full support to the <a>Gwangju Student Movement</a>; in the aftermath, students were apprehended, and Shin Gan Society was exposed.
Later on, students actively participated in V Narod (&#xbe0c;&#xb098;&#xb85c;&#xb4dc;) and Student Enlightenment Movement (&#xd559;&#xc0dd;&#xacc4;&#xbabd;&#xc6b4;&#xb3d9;) during 1929 - 1930.</p>
<p>The Yonhi School, under Japanese oppression in 1940s, still kept producing Korean patriots fought for Korean independence.
In 1942, the Japanese Colonial Government of Korea arrested 33 Korean scholars of Korean language including three members of Yonhi School faculty and prominent Korean language scholars, <em>Choi Hyun Bae</em> (&#xcd5c;&#xd604;&#xbc30;; &#x5d14;&#x9249;&#x57f9;), <em>Lee Yun Jae</em> (&#xc774;&#xc724;&#xc7ac;; &#x674e;&#x5141;&#x5bb0;), and <em>Kim Do Yeon</em> (&#x91d1;&#x5ea6;&#x6f14;; &#xae40;&#xb3c4;&#xc5f0;) and other graduates of the school including <em>Jung Tae Jin</em> (&#xc815;&#xd0dc;&#xc9c4;; &#x4e01;&#x6cf0;&#x93ad;) and <em>Kim Yoon Kyung</em> (&#xae40;&#xc724;&#xacbd;; &#x91d1;&#x5141;&#x7d93;) for organizing the <em>Joseon Language Society</em> (&#xc870;&#xc120;&#xc5b4;&#xd559;&#xd68c;; &#x671d;&#x9bae;&#x8a9e;&#x5b78;&#x6703;; now <a>Korean Language Society</a>; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#xd559;&#xd68c;; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#x5b78;&#x6703;), studying Korean language, and attempting to publish a Korean language dictionary.
<em>Lee Yun Jae</em> died in jail in 1942 from torture and harsh treatment, 11 were found guilty, and 5 including <em>Choi Hyun Bae</em> were put to prison.
Also, <em><a>Yun Dong-ju</a></em> (&#xc724;&#xb3d9;&#xc8fc;; &#x5c39;&#x6771;&#x67f1;), a 1941 graduate of Yonhi School, joined the Korean independence movement, left many poems about patriotism and self-reflection, imprisoned by Japaneses, and died from torture and harsh treatment in 1944.
<p>As tributes to their efforts, Yonsei University has constructed a monument called 'Yonsei Hangultap' (A Monument for Korean Language by Yonsei; &#xc5f0;&#xc138; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#xd0d1;; &#x5ef6;&#x4e16; &#xd55c;&#xae00;&#x5854;), a monument for <em>Yun Dong Ju</em> (&#xc724;&#xb3d9;&#xc8fc; &#xc2dc;&#xbe44;; &#x5c39;&#x6771;&#x67f1; &#x8a69;&#x7891;), and bust statues of <em>Choi Hyun Bae</em> and <em>Kim Yoon Kyung</em> in its Seoul Campus.</p>
<p>Severance was approved as a college by the liberated Korean government in 1947.
Since the majority of medical institutions in Korea was run by the Japanese, medical staff and faculty were in short supply after their departure.
Severance also took up the role of student leadership and was outspoken against <a>US-Soviet occupation</a>.
Although Severance returned to Seoul for a while after its recapture, it had to flee again in December on a <a>LST</a> in <a>Incheon</a>.
When Severance arrived in <a>Busan</a>, its medical school joined the wartime college, a temporary body.
Meanwhile, the Severance facility in Seoul received heavy damage, as it was in the center of the city near <a>Seoul station</a>.
Severance Hospital again returned on April 1, 1952, and its medical college on June 12, 1952.</p>
<p>The U.S. military initially neglected the restitution Yonhi and held other plans to use it as a military hospital or judiciary training center.
With time, nevertheless, Yonhi came to be viewed as a missionary institution that was dispossessed by the Governor-General.
<p>Yonhi was able to open its doors again on January 21, 1946 and, on August 15, 1946, was recognized as a university.
It was a period of transition, and Yonhi University faced numerous obstacles including financial ones; after 1947 things settled down.
At the time, Korea lacked teachers and Yonhi was asked to provide education and training; the Temporary Training Center for Secondary School Teachers in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry (&#xc784;&#xc2dc; &#xc218;&#xbb3c;&#xd654;&#xd559;&#xacfc; &#xc911;&#xb4f1;&#xad50;&#xc6d0;&#xc591;&#xc131;&#xc18c;) was established.
In December 1948, plans for unification of Yonhi and Severance began to take form.
The Graduate School was formed in July 1950.</p>
The North Korean military advanced into the Yonhi campus and established its headquarters there.
This was a cause of severe damage to the campus when the U.S. military recaptured Seoul in September.
The university reopened following the recapture of Seoul, but it was once more on the run to Busan in December.
In February 1951, Yonhi joined the wartime college; however, Yonhi kept an independent body and opened its own courses on October 3, 1951.
On April 15, 1953 Yonhi began its work on restoration; Yonhi returned to its campus in the fall.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|170px|Lee Han Yeol Memorial</a> In 1957, Severance Medical College and Hospital and Yonhi University merged to form Yonsei University.
Today, Yonsei operates its main campus in Seoul and a satellite campus in <a>Wonju</a>, <a>Gangwon</a> Province.</p>
<p>Yonsei University is a school founded on <a>Christian</a> principles  and purporting to &quot;produce Christian leaders with the spirits of freedom and truth&quot;.
The Christian character of the university is also well illustrated by its history as a school originally founded by American Protestant missionaries and by its school motto from the <a>bible</a>, &quot;The truth will set you free&quot; (<a>John</a> 8:32).
As of 2007, the Board of Directors of Yonsei University should include a member from 4 Korean Christian organizations, <a>The Presbyterian Church of Korea</a> (&#xb300;&#xd55c;&#xc608;&#xc218;&#xad50;&#xc7a5;&#xb85c;&#xd68c;), <a>the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea</a> (&#xd55c;&#xad6d;&#xae30;&#xb3c5;&#xad50;&#xc7a5;&#xb85c;&#xd68c;), <a>the Korean Methodist Church</a> (&#xae30;&#xb3c5;&#xad50;&#xb300;&#xd55c;&#xac10;&#xb9ac;&#xd68c;), and the <a>Anglican Church of Korea</a> (&#xb300;&#xd55c;&#xc131;&#xacf5;&#xd68c;).
<p>The conflict between a school's founding ideology and a student's <a>freedom of religion</a> has been a controversy in South Korean society for some time.
However, he or she is required to attend weekly chapel hours which consist of <a>sermon</a>s and public <a>prayer</a>s, similar to other mission schools in South Korea such as <a>Ewha Woman's University</a>, <a>Seoul Women's University</a>, <a>Soongsil University</a>, and <a>Hannam University</a>.
As of 2004, a student of Yonsei University is required to attend weekly chapel hours for 4 semesters and take one Christianity-related class in order to graduate.
A student in Soongsil University sued the university for the limitation of his freedom of religion in 1995 when he could not obtain his bachelor's degree because he did not attend chapel hours, but the Korean court ruled in favor of the school, stating that the school regulation had not limited students' freedom of religion.</p>
<h2>Rivalry with Korea University</h2>
<p> Each claiming to be the best private university in South Korea, Yonsei University and <a>Korea University</a> have had a rivalry that is longer and more intense than any other rivalries between other universities in South Korea.
This can be compared to the rivalries between <a>Oxford University</a> and <a>Cambridge University</a> in the U.K., <a>Waseda University</a> and <a>Keio University</a> in Japan, and <a>De La Salle University</a> and <a>Ateneo de Manila University</a> in the Philippines.</p>
This event, starting from 1925, is called Yon Ko Jeon (&#xc5f0;&#xace0;&#xc804;; &#x5ef6;&#x9ad8;&#x6230;) in the years when Korea University hosts the matches, and called Ko Yon Jeon (&#xace0;&#xc5f0;&#xc804;; &#x9ad8;&#x5ef6;&#x6230;) when Yonsei University hosts the matches.
The annual one-time matches include <a>soccer</a>, <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>rugby</a>, and <a>ice hockey</a>.
<p>The Joint University Campus aspect of the project is expected to be either an overseas campus of a major foreign research university or a joint campus created and managed between such a university and Yonsei University.
