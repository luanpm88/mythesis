established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>[[File:Tallinn Kopli, May 1996.jpg|thumb|right|1932&#x2013;1964 the main building was in [[Kopli]].]]
nickname$$$@@@%%%In the early twentieth century, Estonia recognised an urgent need for locally trained engineering specialists .
established$$$@@@%%%Until then, young people from Estonia had received their specialist education in <a>St.
type$$$@@@%%%Petersburg</a>, <a>Germany</a> or <a>Riga</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Opportunities had to be sought for engineering-minded people to acquire an Estonian-based education which was adapted to local conditions and needs; also, Estonia was in the process of establishing itself as an independent country.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses.
established$$$@@@%%%That date has been recognised as the founding date of the Tallinn University of Technology.
established$$$@@@%%%Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia.
staff$$$@@@%%%In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named the Tallinn Technical Institute.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%In 1938, the name - Tallinn Technical University (TTU) - was effective.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded.
established$$$@@@%%%After 2003 the university was known in English as the Tallinn University of Technology (TUT).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 1 July 2008, TUT took over <a>International University Audentes</a> (IUA), which became part of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, except the Law School which joined the Faculty of Social Sciences.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Alumni</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Besides the entire technological elite of Estonia, alumni also include numerous industrialists and businessmen, including the former Chairman of Hansapank, the biggest bank of the region, Indrek Neivelt; the Chairman of the Estonian <a>Chamber of Commerce</a>, Toomas Luman; and the former Prime Minister and eminent industrialist <a>Tiit V&#x00e4;hi</a>.
country$$$@@@%%%The Vice President and former President of the Estonian <a>Academy of Science</a>, J&#x00fc;ri Engelbrecht, is also a member of TUT.</p>
