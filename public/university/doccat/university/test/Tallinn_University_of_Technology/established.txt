Tallinn University of Technology is not related to <a>Tallinn University</a> (established in 2005).

<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:Tallinn Kopli, May 1996.jpg|thumb|right|1932&#x2013;1964 the main building was in [[Kopli]].]]
Until then, young people from Estonia had received their specialist education in <a>St.
Opportunities had to be sought for engineering-minded people to acquire an Estonian-based education which was adapted to local conditions and needs; also, Estonia was in the process of establishing itself as an independent country.</p>
<p>On 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses.
That date has been recognised as the founding date of the Tallinn University of Technology.
Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture.
In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution.
Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published.
In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia.
<p>By the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named the Tallinn Technical Institute.
In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded.
After 2003 the university was known in English as the Tallinn University of Technology (TUT).
<p>On 1 July 2008, TUT took over <a>International University Audentes</a> (IUA), which became part of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, except the Law School which joined the Faculty of Social Sciences.</p>
<p>Besides the entire technological elite of Estonia, alumni also include numerous industrialists and businessmen, including the former Chairman of Hansapank, the biggest bank of the region, Indrek Neivelt; the Chairman of the Estonian <a>Chamber of Commerce</a>, Toomas Luman; and the former Prime Minister and eminent industrialist <a>Tiit V&#x00e4;hi</a>.
