<p><strong>Institute of Technology, Carlow</strong> (<strong>ITC</strong>), originally <strong>Regional Technical College, Carlow</strong>, is one of the original <a>Regional Technical Colleges</a>, it is located to the south of <a>Carlow</a>, <a>Ireland</a> on <a>Kilkenny</a> Road, it was the first such college announced and located in 1964.</p>
<p>The institute was renamed <strong>Austin Waldron Regional Technical College, Carlow</strong> (<strong>AWRTC Carlow</strong>) in 1989 after a past <a>CEO</a> of <em><a>County Carlow</a> <a>Vocational Education Committee</a></em>, Austin Waldron, who was instrumental in helping the cause of the Regional Technical College in Carlow; it continued to use this name unofficially after 1992 when it reverted to its original name and in 1998 the institute accepted its current name.</p>
The institute also had a Kilkenny Campus previously, and currently offers a single course in Kilkenny in association with the <a>NUIM</a> Kilkenny Campus of <a>St Kieran's College</a>.</p>
At the turn of the millennium the institution completed the &#x00a3;11.5 million (<a>Punt</a>) <em>Learning Resource Centre and Catering Services</em> which won the first prize of the <em>Irish Concrete Society</em> in 2000.</p>
<p>On a side note, one very interesting aspect of the institute is that it is the only third level institute in Ireland to have a <a>Computer Games Development</a> course which was actually developed in conjunction with <a>Microsoft</a>.
It is also one of the few Irish third level institutes to offer a &quot;higher&quot; degree in <a>Industrial Design</a>, generally seen as a continental European and American subject of study.</p>
