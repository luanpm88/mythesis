It was renamed in 1868 as <em>Imperial Moscow Technical School</em>, then after the 1917 revolution to <em>Moscow Highest Technical School</em> (MHTS).
A number of research institutes such as <a>TsAGI</a> were created from laboratories and departments of MHTS in 1930.
The remaining school was named <em><a>Bauman</a> Moscow Mechanical and Machine Construction Institute</em>, after the revolutionary <a>Bolshevik</a> <a>Nikolay Bauman</a>.
The name MHTS was revived in 1943.
