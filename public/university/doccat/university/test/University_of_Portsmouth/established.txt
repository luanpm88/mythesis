<p>The <strong>University of Portsmouth</strong> is a <a>university</a> in <a>Portsmouth</a>, England.
The University was ranked 60th out of 122th in The Sunday Times University Guide.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University was founded as the <em>Portsmouth and <a>Gosport</a> School of Science and the Arts</em> in 1869.
Due to the dependence on shipping and trade to the city, the main function of the college was to train the engineers and skilled workmen who went on to work at the city docks, as well as at the large <a>Royal Navy dockyard</a> situated in Portsmouth.
However, due to a decline in <a>shipping</a> and population since <a>World War II</a>, when large swathes of the city were destroyed by German bombing, the college was forced to diversify in terms of its syllabus and teaching in order to attract new students.</p>
<p>This steadily continued until the 1960s when, due to a massive government-sponsored expansion in <a>Higher Education</a>, the college was renamed Portsmouth Polytechnic.
Along with this new name came the power for Portsmouth to award degrees, accredited and validated by the centralised <a>CNAA</a>.
The expansion of the polytechnic continued and in the late 1980s, it was considered one of the largest and the best performing polytechnics in the UK.
Portsmouth was granted university status with the power to validate its own degrees along with the other polytechnics in 1992, under the provision of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Portsmouth is managed in accordance with Articles of Government approved by the Secretary of State.
The Act also set the general format for an Instrument of Government determining the membership, constitution and organisational structure of Boards of Governors.</p>
<p>The formal inauguration of the University of Portsmouth was celebrated at a ceremony in the Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 July 1992.</p>
<p>The University is split between two campuses: <a>Guildhall</a> and <a>Langstone</a>.</p>
<p>Langstone is the smaller of the two campuses, located in <a>Milton</a> on the eastern edge of <a>Portsea Island</a>, the island on which the city of <a>Portsmouth</a> sits.
It also includes a restaurant and bar, as well as a 'student village', which provides accommodation for 565 students in three <a>halls of residence</a>; Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother (QEQM), Trust Hall and Langstone Flats.
Students in QEQM and Langstone Flats have en-suite rooms.
It used to be home of the University's School of Languages and Area Studies.
The School has now moved into the Park Building on the Guildhall Campus.</p>
Unlike most university campuses, it is not all enclosed on one tract of land, instead featuring various university buildings scattered throughout the centre of the city.
<p>The University Library (formerly the Frewen Library) was extended in 2006 at a cost of &#x00a3;11 million.
Originally due to open in October, ongoing delays meant that it was not complete until January 2007, when it was opened by the crime writer <a>P.
The University has also in recent years invested in the Faculty of Science, in particular through the renovation of its aluminium-clad main building (St Michael's) which is adjacent to the student halls, <a>James Watson</a>.</p>
<p>A new faculty called &quot;Creative and Cultural Industries&quot; was opened in September 2006.
It aims to provide a unique environment in which all aspects of creative thinking will flourish and develop by combining creative schools from across the university.</p>
<p>Portsmouth has been rated as the 5th best modern university in the UK by <a>The Times Good University Guide</a> and 60th overall.

<p><a>thumb|Students' Union</a> The University of Portsmouth Students' Union was voted best Union in the UK in the <a>New Musical Express</a> in 2004.
Formerly housed in the ex-NAAFI (Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes) building Alexandra House, a new &#x00a3;6.5 million purpose-built Union was opened in 2002 at the other end of Ravelin Park, to the north of Frewen Library, though the main entertainment area has been significantly altered recently.</p>
<p>The Union houses a <a>bar</a> and a <a>Co-Op</a> grocery shop, along with <a>Blackwells</a> bookshop, <a>Connect up</a> the university's computer help store and also its own radio station, Pure FM.
<p>Since the summer of 2005, a restructure resulted in the division of the Union into the UPSU - whose broad remit covers such areas as providing representation and running University clubs and societies - and its trading-orientated operations, under the remit of the University of Portsmouth Enterprise Ltd., a company owned by the University of Portsmouth to offer &quot;to business, industry and the public sector the wide range of skills and knowledge in the University&quot;.</p>
<p>In June 2010 The University of Portsmouth Students' Union was the first Students' Union within England and Wales to register as a full charity.
The change came so as to comply with legislation introduced in 2006.
<p>The University announced in June 2009 their intention to permanently close two of the remaining three late-night entertainment venues, with both clubs Lux and Co2 closing.</p>
<p>The Students' Union offers a range of sports clubs and social societies for students.
The sports on offer vary from traditional team games like <a>football</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>netball</a> and <a>cricket</a> to <a>Octopush</a>, a form of underwater hockey and men's lacrosse.
Notably, the University is home to the longest-running university paintball club in the United Kingdom.
Ski and snowboard is the most popular club in the Athletic Union, with over 300 members and trips to various ski resorts in Europe.
<p>University of Portsmouth Enterprise Limited (UPEL), which operates the Student Centres Bar operation</p>
<p>Following financial difficulties in 2005, UPSU was re-structured and is now a registered charity, with its trading arm (UPSU Trading Ltd.) placed under the direct control of the University, through the auspices of UPEL (University of Portsmouth Enterprise Ltd, previously only used for commercialising research).
As a result of this new investment, in October 2005 the Union was redeveloped.</p>
