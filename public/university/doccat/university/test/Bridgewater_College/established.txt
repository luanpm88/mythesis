Established in 1880, Bridgewater College is the first <a>co-education</a>al four-year <a>college</a> in <a>Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>Nestled in the scenic and historic <a>Shenandoah Valley</a>, Bridgewater's  campus features buildings with a modified Georgian architectural style.

<p>Bridgewater College was established in 1880 as Spring Creek Normal and Collegiate Institute by Daniel Christian Flory, an alumnus of the <a>University of Virginia</a> and a young progressive leader in the <a>Church of the Brethren</a>.
Nine years later, the school was named Bridgewater College and chartered by the <a>Commonwealth of Virginia</a> to grant <a>undergraduate</a> degrees.
Bridgewater conferred its first <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree on June 1, 1891, becoming the first of the colleges having historic associations with the Church of the Brethren to grant degrees.</p>
<p>Organized as a residential college, the founders believed that students living together over a four-year period would learn from one another as well as the faculty.
<p>Two major influences, the <a>University of Virginia</a> and the Church of the Brethren, have shaped Bridgewater College as an educational institution and created its personality.
Its historic association with the Church of the Brethren, modified <a>Georgian architecture</a>, <a>Honor Code</a>, and seal depicting truth, beauty, goodness, and harmony bear testimony to the strength of these two shaping influences.</p>
<p><a>240px|left|thumb|College gate</a> Bridgewater College became the first private, senior co-educational liberal arts college in Virginia and one of the few accredited colleges of its type in the South.
The emphasis on ethical and spiritual values in educational programs is a result of Bridgewater&#x2019;s heritage and institutional idealism.
The importance placed on these values can be seen through course offerings and convocation programs that encourage personal integrity and strong social consciousness.</p>

Electing to keep its enrollment small, Bridgewater continues to maintain a faculty-student ratio of 1:14 and offers the Bachelor of Arts and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees.
