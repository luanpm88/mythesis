The distance learning portion lasts 9 or 10 weeks depending on the course and allows the candidates to remain with their respective units.
<p>Since May 2009, NCMPDC is under the command of the Canadian Forces College (CFC) in Toronto, which offers a similar professional development curricumlum but for officer from the ranks of major to brigadier-general.</p>
<p>Typically, successful applicants enter the Canadian Military College (CMC) System as an Officer Cadet, where they receive an education that balances academics, leadership, bilingualism and athletics.
If there are more qualified candidates than the CMC System can accommodate or the choice of programme is not offered, such as <a>Nursing</a>, <a>Physiotherapy</a> and <a>Pharmacy</a>, successful applicants would be eligible to apply to any Canadian university where books, lab fees and student fees are covered, and students receive a monthly salary.</p>
<p>The undergraduate student body, known as the Cadet Wing, is sub-divided into 3 smaller groupings called <em>Squadrons</em>, under the guidance and supervision of senior cadets.
<p>When they arrive at the Officer Cadets Division, the officer-cadets have already chosen their service.
The cadets can leave the campus at any time when they do not have classes, study periods or training.</p>
<p>On the weekend, with the exception of military training, the students are largely free.</p>
Pavillons Vanier, DeL&#x00e9;ry, Dextraze, Massey and the Old Mess are shared.
