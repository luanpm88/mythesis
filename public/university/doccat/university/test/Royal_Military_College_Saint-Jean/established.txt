Intended for students who have obtained their <a>high-school</a> certificates in Quebec or the equivalent elsewhere in Canada, the program prepares students to continue their studies at the Royal Military College of Canada in <a>Kingston, Ontario</a>.</p>
<p>Military education for Canadian officers is focused on the four components unique to the military colleges: military training, physical fitness, bilingualism and academic excellence.
<p>Founded in 1966, the mission of the CFMDS is to apply management and leadership training and consultation to the defence team.
<p>The NCMPDC was created on 1 April 2003 and is located at Campus St-Jean.
<p>The NCMPDC courses were created as a result of the NCM Corps 2020, which is the strategic suidance for the professional development of the Canadian Forces Non-Commissioned Members.
<p>More than a thousand members of the Canadian Forces transit through the NCMPDC each year in order to perfect their knowledge and skills following or before their promotion to the ranks of warrant officer (petty officer 1st class), master warrant officer (chief petty officer second class) or chief warrant officer (chief petty officer first class).</p>
It is the only pan-CF school that is for NCM's taught by NCM's and as of September 2007 commanded by an NCM.</p>
<p>In addition to a university education, Officer Cadets receive military training, occupation training and second language training and a career after graduation.
The application deadline to ROTP is in January for Basic Officer Training in July and admission the following September.</p>
Military Potential is an assessment of Aptitudes, Personality Traits, and the choice of occupation.

<p>The preuniversity programme features modern, diversified teaching methods: workshops, introduction to research methods, laboratories, group projects, oral and multimedia presentations.
<p>The cadets live in the Cartier Building or the Champlain Building and eat in  <a>Dextraze</a> Pavilion (completed in 1993).
<p>During the week, the daily routine consists of inspection, running, breakfast, classes, sports, and studies.
The <a>military training</a> is in the form of drill, cartography, compass use and three major field exercises each year.
Outside classes, <a>bilingualism</a> is promoted by <a>French</a> / <a>English</a> weeks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Fall 2007, the federal government reopened the military college at Saint-Jean, which was closed in 1995.
The reopening of RMC Saint-Jean greatly differs from the original college which opened in 1952 and from the RMC of Canada located in Kingston.
The new RMC Saint-Jean emcompasses the Canadian Forces Management and Development School, one of the oldest CF training establishments in the country.
<p><a>Micha&#x00eb;lle Jean</a>, Governor General of Canada, inaugurated the Royal Military College Saint-Jean on May 24, 2008, and she presented the new college coat of arms to the Commandant, Colonel Francois Pion.</p>
<p>The Commandant of Royal Military College Saint-Jean reports to the Commander, Canadian Defence Academy (CDA).
The first-year program at RMC Saint-Jean is freeing up beds at <a>RMC</a> allowing more Regular Officer Training Program (ROTP) cadets to attend <a>RMC</a> rather than civilian universities.</p>

The museum mandate is to collect, conserve, research and display material relating to the history of the CMR, its former cadets and its site, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
The museum contains collections of military memorabilia and military artefacts.
The site has been occupied since 1666 by different garrisons, a shipyard and a military college.</p>
<p>The CMR Ex-Cadet Foundation manages the museum which recognizes more than 325 years (1666&#x2013;1995) of military history at the fortifications located on the Richelieu River.
<p>The museum was located in the old <a>guardhouse</a> from 1974&#x2013;1998.
The museum was closed from 1998&#x2013;2003 but is now situated in the former Protestant chapel.
The museum is opened Wednesday to Sunday, from 10:00 to 17:00, from May 24 until September 1.
The museum has formed a cooperating association of friends of the museum to assist with projects.</p>
The campus provides state-of-the-art technological support: <a>library</a>, well-equipped laboratories, ample supplies of learning materials, and Internet access.
RMC Saint-Jean infrastructure is currently used by the <a>Canadian Forces</a> located at <a>ASU Saint-Jean</a> and by a non-profit corporation called <em>Campus du <a>Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)</a></em>, which arranges for the upkeep of many of the educational facilities and leases them out to educational institutions such as the <a>Universit&#x00e9; du Qu&#x00e9;bec &#x00e0; Montr&#x00e9;al</a> (UQAM) for their local program while also renting out others for short events such as large <a>banquet</a>s or <a>convention</a>s.
