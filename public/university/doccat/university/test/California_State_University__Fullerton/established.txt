<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1951, Cal State Fullerton became the twelfth State College in California to be authorized by the State Legislature as a degree granting institution.
The following year, a site was designated for the campus to be established in northeast Fullerton.
The property was purchased in 1959.
William B. Langsdorf</a> was appointed as the founding president of the school.</p>
<p>The University was originally named <strong>Orange County State College</strong>.
Classes began with 452 students in September, 1959.
The name of the school was changed to <strong>Orange State College</strong> in July 1962.
In 1964, the name of the school was changed for a second time to <strong>California State College at Fullerton</strong>.
In June 1972, the final name change occurred and the school became <strong>California State University, Fullerton</strong>.</p>
<p>On July 12, 1976, <a>Edward Charles Allaway</a>, a campus janitor with <a>paranoid schizophrenia</a>, shot nine people, killing seven, in the University Library (now the Pollak Library) on the Cal State Fullerton campus.</p>
<p>On October 13, 1984, Edward Cooperman, a <a>physics</a> professor, was shot and killed by his former student, Minh Van Lam, in McCarthy Hall.</p>
<p>The university grew rapidly in the 2000 decade.
The Performing Arts Center was built in January 2006, and in the summer of 2008 the newly constructed Steven G. Mihaylo Hall as well as the new Student Recreation Center have opened their doors.
In the fall of 2008, the Performing Arts Center was renamed <a>Joseph A.W. Clayes III</a> Performing Arts Center, in honor of a $5 million pledge made to the University by the trustees of the Joseph A.W. Clayes III Charitable Trust.
<p>During the fall 2007 semester, Cal State Fullerton had the highest enrollment of the 23 <a>California State University</a> campuses with a record-setting enrollment of 37,130 students.
It was the third largest university in the state of California, just below <a>UCLA</a> and <a>CSULB</a>, for that semester.</p>
<p>The choice of the <a>elephant</a> as the University&#x2019;s <a>mascot</a>, dubbed Tuffy the Titan, dates to the early 1960s when the campus hosted &quot;The First Intercollegiate Elephant Race in Human History.&quot;
The May 11 event attracted 10,000 spectators, 15 pachyderm entrants, a <a>telegram</a> from <a>Richard M. Nixon</a>, and worldwide news coverage.</p>

<p>Cal State Fullerton was built on the site of former citrus groves in northeast Fullerton.
It is bordered on the east by <a>57 Freeway</a>.
Although established in the late 1950s, much of the initial construction on campus took place in the late 1960s, under the supervision of noted artist and architect Howard van Heuklyn, who gave the campus a striking, <a>futuristic</a> architecture (buildings like the Pollak Library south, Titan Shops, Humanities, McCarthy Hall).
This was in response to the numerous <a>Googie</a> buildings in the Fullerton community.
The library houses the <a>Philip K. Dick</a> Science Fiction Collection.</p>
It has gained nationwide fame in recent years for the Arboretum's highly successful efforts in breeding the <a>Titan Arum</a> plant, which the school has been sponsoring in honor of its sports team, the Titans.
The Arboretum has been successful in producing four blooming specimens by 2006.</p>
<p>The University has a campus in Irvine.
Originally offered on the Saddleback College campus in Mission Viejo, the classes were moved to their current location in buildings on the former <a>El Toro Marine Corps Air Station</a> in Irvine.</p>
<p>CSUF has announced plans to expand into the area south of Nutwood Avenue, to construct a project called CollegeTown.</p>
<p>CSU Fullerton is the only campus in California that offers the Master of Science in <a>Nursing</a> with a concentration in school nursing.</p>
