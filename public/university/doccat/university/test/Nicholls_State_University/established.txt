<p><strong>Nicholls State University</strong>, founded in 1948, is a public <a>university</a> located in <a>Thibodaux</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, USA.
Nicholls is part of the <a>University of Louisiana System</a> of universities.
Originally called Francis T. Nicholls Junior College, the institution split from the <a>Louisiana State University System</a> in 1956.
The university is named for <a>Francis T. Nicholls</a>, a former <a>governor of Louisiana</a>, and member of the <a>Louisiana Supreme Court</a>.
<p>The  campus, once part of historic Acadia Plantation, fronts on Bayou Lafourche, about  southwest of <a>New Orleans</a> and  southeast of <a>Baton Rouge</a>.
<p>Nicholls is located in <a>Acadiana</a>, also known as &quot;<a>Cajun</a> Country,&quot; an area rich in tradition and culture.
It is also located in the heart of the <a>Mississippi River Delta</a>, allowing easy access to the river, its distributaries, <a>Louisiana's wetlands</a>, and the <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>.
The school is sometimes referred to as &quot;Our Harvard on the Bayou;&quot; the university bookstore even sells shirts sporting this light-hearted nickname.
<p>Nicholls is the home of the <a>John Folse Culinary Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Louisiana System has identified the following areas as Unique Areas of Excellence at Nicholls State University.
<p>Nicholls is one of the first institutions in the United States to offer bachelor degrees in Culinary Arts.
Students gain expertise in both Cajun and French cuisine.
The John Folse Culinary Institute is the only American member of the prestigious Institut Paul Bocuse.
In the past three years, several faculty members have been awarded grants from the Louisiana Board of Regents.
The university has the only certified geneticist in the South.
It also has the highest rate of librarians with PhDs in both public and private universities and colleges in the state.
Nicholls is also the home of the Center for Women in Government as well as the Dyslexia Center of Louisiana.</p>
During the aftermath of Katrina, Nicholls suspended its admissions selectivity in order to accommodate students from hurricane affected institutions.
The university also had many matriculating students who were affected by the hurricane and did not return.
College ranking systems and review publications fail to recognize these factors.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2005, the No. 24-ranked Nicholls Colonels football team clinched its first Southland Conference Championship by defeating the <a>McNeese State</a> Cowboys 39-26 at John L. Guidry Stadium.
Although met with criticism from the school and surrounding community who were in favor of preserving the colonel mascot, the retirement of the mascot was considered vital to the public relations outlook of the university and its policy of solidarity with The University of Louisiana System's policy on discrimination.
<p>The Nicholls State University Department of Athletics currently sponsors men's intercollegiate baseball, basketball, football, golf and tennis along with women's intercollegiate basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, track, volleyball and cheerleading.</p>
<h2>School of Art</h2>
<p>The art program is built upon a broad liberal arts foundation and preparation in studio disciplines required for careers in the visual arts and design.
<p>The Division of Art supports the university mission in offering individuals an opportunity to study the visual arts.
It aims to provide quality studies in all visual media (photography, graphic design, printmaking, painting, drawing, ceramics, sculpture, and art history), to provide an environment in which students from the region can understand their personal place in the history of art, to provide the skills needed for both employment or continued studies in their area, and to provide a degree in visual arts, with a concentration in studio art, applied arts, or art education.</p>
<p>The university awards the Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in art to students who, in addition to satisfying the minimum requirements for graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences, complete the art curriculum outline.</p>
