The institution, having started as a <a>normal school</a>, has a traditional strength in teacher education.
The recent addition of the River Campus, housing the Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts, has increased the university's commitment to education in the arts.
<p>In Fall 2006, the University had over 10,000 students for the first time.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Southeast Missouri State University has had five names in its history, each time attempting to better reflect its mission and identity: &lt;center&gt; : &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p>Southeast Missouri State University was founded in 1873 when a group of prominent businessmen and politicians successfully lobbied the State of <a>Missouri</a> to designate <a>Cape Girardeau</a> as the home of the Third District <a>Normal School</a>.
Originally known as Southeast Missouri State Normal School, the first classes were originally taught at the nearby Lorimier School until April 1875 when the first normal school building was completed.

&quot;There was another college higher up on an airy summit--a bright new edifice, picturesquely and peculiarly towered</pre>
<p>and pinnacled--a sort of gigantic casters, with the cruets all complete.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The Original Normal School Building burned down on April 8, 1902, [<a>http://library.semo.edu/info/building_history.shtml</a>] and was replaced in 1906 by Academic Hall, the school's domed landmark building.
It was designed by <a>Jerome Bibb Legg</a>, who also designed the <a>St.
<p>In the 1950s Southeast Missouri State College had an enrollment of approximately 1,600 students and steadily increased to more than 7,000 students in the 1970s due to low tuition costs, aggressive recruiting, and the construction of <a>Interstate 55</a> between <a>St.
The College also moved away from its focus on only training teachers and began to offer courses of study in business, nursing, and the liberal arts.
Due to this expansion of curriculum and student body population, the college officially became Southeast Missouri State University in 1972.
In 1998, the university acquired the former <a>St.
Vincent's Seminary</a> on the <a>Mississippi river</a>.
This property has been redeveloped as the <a>Earl and Margie Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts</a>, which opened in Fall 2007.</p>
<p>Missouri State Normal School&#x2014;Third District President John Sephus McGhee established the University Schools on June 15, 1896.
As the university expanded its curriculum and extra-curricular activities so did the University Schools.
In 1903, as recent construction allowed for more space for university classes, the training school was able to expand its class sizes as well.
The University Schools consisted of an elementary, junior high, and high school.
The University Schools closed at the end of the 1986-1987 school year, due to increasing costs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Normal School Building</strong> was completed in 1875, on the site of the current Academic Hall.
Initially it was the only school building and housed classrooms, offices, and storage.
Normal School Building was 3 stories tall, built of brick in the French Second Empire style, and was designed by Charles B. Clark of St. Louis.
Just as construction was beginning on what would become Carnahan Hall in 1902, the school building burned down, at which time Academic Hall was erected in its place.</p>
<p><strong>Carnahan Hall</strong> was initially built as the Science Building, and was later changed to become the Social Science Building.
It is built in the Neoclassical Style and was completed in 1902 by Jerome B. Legg, who also designed Academic Hall.
It is the oldest standing building on Campus and underwent a major Renovation between 1994 and 1998.
During the renovation the entire interior was removed from the masonry shell, and rebuilt with state of the art technology without diminishing the historic fabric of the building&#x2019;s exterior.
Upon completion of the project, the building was rededicated Carnahan Hall in honor of Congressman and Ambassador Carnahan of Carter, MO.
Today Carnahan Hall houses the College of Liberal Arts.
<p>The <strong>Foreign Language Building</strong>, also known as the Art Building, was built in 1902 by the same designer of Academic Hall and Carnahan Hall.
Built as the companion to Carnahan Hall, it is identical to Carnahan Hall except for the pair of small towers that were added later for dramatic effect.
The Art Building currently houses the Language and Anthropology Departments of the College of Liberal Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Albert and Lemming Halls</strong> were completed in 1904 and 1905 respectively, and were built to meet the growing demand for student housing close to campus.
At the time of completion these were the only dormitories on campus, and previously students had to rent housing or live with families in the town some distance from campus.
No longer standing, these three story dorms were built of limestone in the neoclassical style, Albert Hall located where Dearmont Hall now stands, and Lemming on the site of the University Center.
These halls were named for members of the University Board of Regents, who were instrumental in expanding the campus at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Serena Hall</strong> was built in 1905 and named for Joseph Serena, the eighth President of the University.
Originally it was the School of Manual Training, and was the home of the Industrial Technology Department until the completion of Seabaugh Hall.
The East and West wings were built in 1962 and 1983 respectively, and were intentionally designed to contrast with the neoclassical style of the main building.

<p><strong>Houck Stadium</strong> was built in 1930, and is one of the oldest stadiums in Missouri.
It is built of native limestone quarried from the building site.

<p><strong><em>Kent Library</em></strong> ,built in 1939 as a WPA project, houses the school&#x2019;s library, archives, rare book room, Center for William Faulkner Studies, Center for Scholarship in Teaching and Learning, and computer labs.

The library is named for Sadie Kent, a longtime Librarian and faculty member at the school</p>
<p><strong>Cheney Hall</strong> was built in 1939 as a WPA project along with Kent Library.
It is the oldest residence hall on campus, and was built in the neoclassical style to match the aesthetic of the rest of the campus.
The hall is named for the first President of the Normal School, Lucius H. Cheney.
<p><strong>Rosemary Berkel Crisp Hall of Nursing</strong> was built between 1921 and 1923 as the Training School.
Built in the neoclassical style it was designed by Study &amp; Farrar of St. Louis.
In 1998 the U-shaped north side of the building was enclosed to house Dempster Auditorium.
The Training School underwent a major renovation in 1987 and was rededicated in 1988 in honor of philanthropist, women&#x2019;s health activist, and long standing member of the Southeast Missouri State University foundation, Mrs. Rosemary Berkel Crisp.
Crisp Hall currently houses the College of Health and Human Services and the Center for Health and Human Services that serves as a full time student clinic on campus.</p>
