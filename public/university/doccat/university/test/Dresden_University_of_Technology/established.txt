The name Technische Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden has only been used since 1961; the history of the university, however, goes back nearly 200 years to 1828.
This makes it one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany, and one of the country&#x2019;s oldest universities, which in German today refers to institutes of higher education which cover the entire curriculum.
The university is member of <a>TU 9</a>, a consortium of the nine leading German Institutes of Technology.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1828, with emerging <a>industrialization</a>, the &quot;Saxon Technical School&quot; was founded to educate skilled workers in technological subjects such as <a>mechanics</a>, <a>mechanical engineering</a> and ship construction.
In 1871, the year the <a>German Empire</a> was founded, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon <a>Polytechnic</a> (<em>K&#x00f6;niglich-S&#x00e4;chsisches Polytechnikum</em>).
By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all disciplines.
In 1961 it was then given its present name, the Dresden University of Technology (<em>Technische Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden</em>).</p>
<p>Upon <a>German reunification</a> in 1990, the university had already integrated the College of Forestry (Forstliche Hochschule) in the nearby small town of <a>Tharandt</a>.
This was followed by the integration of the Dresden College of Engineering (Ingenieurshochschule Dresden), the <a>Friedrich List</a> College of Transport (Hochschule f&#x00fc;r Verkehrswesen) the faculty of transport science, and the &#x201c;Carl-Gustav Carus&#x201d; Medical Academy (Medizinische Akademie or MedAk for short), the medical faculty.
Some faculties were newly founded: the faculties of <a>Information Technology</a> (1991), <a>Law</a> (1991), <a>Education</a> (1993) and <a>Economics</a> (1993).
<p>The Dresden University of Technology is organized into 14 <a>faculties</a>.
Almost all faculties are located on the main campus South of the city center, except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the <a>Elbe</a> river East of the city center and the Department of Forestry in <a>Tharandt</a>.</p>
It is composed of 5 departments, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology.
In October 2006 the <a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> decided to fund a new graduate school, the <em>Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering</em> and a so called cluster of excellence <em>From Cells to Tissues to Therapies</em>.</p>
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Civil Engineering</strong> is structured into 11 departments.
It is the oldest and smallest of the faculties.
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology</strong> is organized into 13 departments.
The faculty is the heart of the so called <em>Silicon Saxony</em> in <a>Dresden</a>.</li>
The Forestry department is the oldest of its kind in <a>Germany</a>.
Its history goes back to the foundation of the <em>K&#x00f6;niglich-S&#x00e4;chsische Forstakademie</em> in 1816.</li>
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Mechanical Engineering</strong> comprises 19 departments and has 4,140 students.</li>
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences &#x201c;<a>Friedrich List</a>&#x201d;</strong> is the only of its kind in <a>Germany</a> covering transport and traffic from economy and system theory science to electrical, civil and mechanical engineering.
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Law</strong> is going to close in the next few years.
The TU Dresden has partially compensated the closure by establishing a private law school</li>
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Philosophy</strong> comprises seven departments, Art History, Communications, History, Musicology, Political Sciences, Sociology and Theology.
<li>The <a>School of International Studies</a> is a so-called <em>central institution</em> of the university coordinating the <a>law</a>, <a>economics</a> and <a>political sciences</a> departments for courses of interdisciplinary <a>international relations</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong><em><a>Carl Gustav Carus</a></em> Faculty of Medicine</strong> has its own campus East of the city center near the <a>Elbe</a> river.
The faculty has a partnership with <a>Partners Harvard Medical International</a>.</li>
<li>The <em><a>Hannah Arendt</a></em> Center for Research on <a>Totalitarianism</a> (HAIT Hannah-Arendt-Institut f&#x00fc;r Totalitarismusforschung an der Technischen Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden e. V.)</li>
The center offers a Master's course in Mechatronics in <a>Hanoi</a> (<a>Vietnam</a>) since 2004.</li>
<li><a>School of International Studies</a> (Zentrum f&#x00fc;r Internationale Studien, ZIS in German)</li>
<p>With regard to its ability to generate research money from industry partners, the TU Dresden belongs to the most successful in <a>Germany</a>.
The TU Dresden benefits from the strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, but also from the establishment of new research fields such as Biotechnology.</p>
<p>The <em><a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a></em> supports the university in many areas and TU Dresden cooperates closely with renowned research institutes such as <a>Fraunhofer Society</a>, <em><a>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community</a></em> and <a>Max Planck Society</a>.</p>
<p>The university has established a strong partnership with the <em><a>Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics</a></em> in molecular bioengineering.
As part of the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>, the <a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> has decided to fund a Cluster of Excellence &quot;From Cells to Tissues to Therapies: Engineering the Cellular Basis of Regeneration&quot; <a>(DFG-Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden)</a>, the  as well as a new graduate school, the &quot;<a>Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering</a>&quot; with about 300 PhD students.</p>
<p>The <em><a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a></em> funds research in the area of electromagnetic flow influence in metallurgy, artificial crystal formation and electrochemistry.
Other research is done on the <a>Meissner effect</a> and artificial fibers (textile).</p>
<p>Since the early 1990s, the <a>Dresden</a> area has developed into a so called <em>Silicon Saxony</em> and the TU Dresden is incorporated in this network with three departments of the Faculties of Electrical Engineering and Sciences.
<p>The university has a partnership with the <em>Fraunhofer-Institut for Transport and Infrastructure systems</em> to research on IT-systems for public transport in Dresden.</p>
<p>In partnership with TU Dresden, the <em>Ifo Institute of Economic Research (Ifo Institut f&#x00fc;r Wirtschaftsforschung e.V.)</em> is researching the economic development in Eastern Germany.</p>
It has a high reputation in technical fields such as <a>electrical engineering</a>, <a>computer science</a>, photo optics, engine construction and traffic logistics.</p>
Special attention and praise is given to the field of international relations, with the university offering the only undergraduate studies in <a>international relations</a> in Germany, accession to which is restricted by comprehensive admission exams.
The university is also highly recognized for the high number of entrepreneurs among the graduates (for example in <a>bioscience</a> firms) and the amount of funds raised from outside sources.</p>
<p>The Center of Biotechnology (&quot;<a>BIOTEC</a>&quot;) is a unique interdisciplinary center focusing on research and teaching in molecular <a>bioengineering</a>.
<p>The university is currently developing new strategies to make itself more independent from state funding and decision making.
As one of the first universities in Germany it has opened a branch in <a>Hanoi</a>, <a>Vietnam</a> offering a Master's course in <a>mechatronics</a>.
<a>Boston University</a>, <a>Georgetown University</a>, <a>Harvard Medical School</a> and <a>Tongji University</a>.</p>
<p>In <a>2009</a> <a>TU Dresden</a>, all Dresden institutes of the <a>Fraunhofer Society</a>, the <a>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community</a> and the <a>Max Planck Society</a> and <a>Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a>, soon incorporated into the <a>Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres</a>, published a joint letter of intent with the name DRESDEN-Konzept - Dresden Research and Education Synergies for the Development of Excellence and Novelty, which points out worldwide elite aspirations, which was recognized as the first time that all four big post-gradual elite institutions declared campus co-operation with a university.
The architecture of these buildings is mostly influenced by the art nouveau style or the Bauhaus school (e.g. the Chemistry building <em>Fritz-Foerster-Bau</em>).
In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).</p>
The main campus is located South of the city center, mostly in the area bordered by N&#x00f6;thnitzer Stra&#x00df;e, Fritz-F&#x00f6;rster-Platz and M&#x00fc;nchner Platz; the medical faculty can be found in the Johannstadt district.
The faculty of forestry resides in a forest area in the nearby town of Tharandt.</p>
