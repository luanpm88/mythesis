established$$$@@@%%%<p> Founded in 1770 and chartered in 1785, the College of Charleston is the oldest institution of higher education in South Carolina, and the 13th oldest in the United States.
country$$$@@@%%%During the colonial period, wealthy families sent their sons abroad for higher education.
established$$$@@@%%%By the mid-18th century, many leading citizens supported the idea of establishing an institution of higher learning within the state.
established$$$@@@%%%On January 30, 1770, Lieutenant Governor William Bull recommended to the colony&#x2019;s general assembly the establishment of a provincial college.
established$$$@@@%%%However, internal disagreements, political rivalries and the American Revolution delayed its progress.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>On March 19, 1785, the College of Charleston was chartered to &#x201c;encourage and institute youth in the several branches of liberal education.&#x201d;

established$$$@@@%%%Only the College of Charleston continues today as a college.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College was rechartered in 1791 because of questions about the 1785 Act, and the trustees hired Rev.
