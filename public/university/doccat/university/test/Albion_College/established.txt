<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|A 19-century drawing of Albion College</a> The origin of Albion College lies not in the city of Albion, but about  southeast of the present location of the college.
On March 23, 1835, <a>Methodist Episcopal</a> settlers in <a>Spring Arbor Township</a> obtained a charter for the Spring Arbor Seminary from the <a>Michigan Territorial</a> Legislature.
Foundations for a building were begun in 1837 at a location about  southwest of the current village of <a>Spring Arbor</a> but were soon abandoned due to the economic turmoil caused by the <a>Panic of 1837</a>.
No classes were ever held at the Spring Arbor location.
The trustees applied to move the seminary to Albion in 1838, and the legislature approved the move in 1839.</p>
<p>With 60 acres (243,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) of land donated by Albion pioneer, <a>Jesse Crowell</a>, the cornerstone was laid for the first building in 1841.
In 1843, now named the <strong>Wesleyan Seminary</strong>, classes were first held in the local Methodist Church.
In 1844, classes began in the newly constructed Central Building, which was rebuilt as the present Robinson Hall in 1907.</p>
<p>The <strong>Albion Female Collegiate Institute</strong> was founded in 1850 by the Wesleyan Seminary Corporation.
The two schools merged in 1857 under the name <strong>The Wesleyan Seminary and Female College at Albion</strong>.</p>
<p>On February 25, 1861, both schools were completely merged under the name <strong>Albion College</strong> when the school was fully authorized by the State legislature to confer a full four-year college degree upon both men and women.</p>
Gene Cline, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, directs a seminar-style honors class</a> Albion College offers approximately 25 academic majors leading to Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees.
The average class size of under 19 is comparable to other small liberal arts colleges.
<p>Albion College offers many opportunities for students to travel and study at other institutions.
Also, Albion is a member of The Princeton Review's 371 Best Colleges and Best Midwestern Colleges list.
<p>Albion College's  campus houses 93% of the students that attend the college in four <a>dormitories</a> (Wesley Hall, Seaton Hall, Whitehouse Hall, and the Mitchell Towers), upper-class apartments (the Mae Harrison Karro Residential Village, Munger Place, the Burns Street Apartments, and the Briton House Apartments), seven women-only housing options (The Beach House, Porter Street Annex, The Manor, Octagon House, Ingham Hall, Fiske Hall and Dean Hall), one men-only housing option (711 Michigan Avenue), six <a>fraternity houses</a>, and numerous annexes.
In addition to campus housing, several students live at <a>The Goodrich Club</a>, a co-op founded in 1932.
The Mae Karro Residential Village (commonly called &quot;The Mae&quot;) houses Seniors.
The majority of rooms in Wesley and Seaton Halls house two students with residents of each hallway sharing one community bathroom.
<p>In 2006 Albion College designated one of the schools annexes as the &quot;Environmental House.&quot;
Since this time the students who live in the house have worked towards self sustainability and raising environmental awareness on campus.</p>
<p>The  Whitehouse Nature Center plays an important role in classroom instruction at Albion College and offers its facilities and services as an environmental education area to public schools and the community.
The Whitehouse Nature Center features six self-guided trails, 400 plant species, 168 bird species,  of oak-hickory and flood-plain forest, a tall-grass prairie and spring in the Adele D. Whitehouse Wildflower Garden, an arboretum of Michigan trees and shrubs,  of farmland and research projects, and an interpretative building with classrooms, observation room, porch, and restrooms.
Every spring a <a>controlled burn</a> is performed in the prairie section of the nature center in order to restore and perpetuate the native prairie ecosystem.</p>
<p>The recently constructed Nancy G. Held Equestrian Center is the only equestrian center owned by a private college in Michigan.

<p>2006 was the beginning of significant change at Albion College starting with a movement to create a more sustainable environment, for both the students and residents of Albion.
The Dining and Hospitality Services and the grounds department at the college were the first to make the transition.
Dining services introduced organic foods into the diets of students on campus while making the effort to purchase from Michigan-based suppliers.
The gardens simply collect the surface water from the outdoor tennis courts.
The grounds department went from throwing away 700 cubic yards of leaves to only 7 cubic yards.
Kresge Hall, the college&#x2019;s primary athletic gym, uses a heat recovery system to maximize energy efficiency in a building which requires 100% makeup air.
The first stages of this plan included making lighting more economically and environmentally beneficial in the Dow Center&#x2019;s Lomas Field house, Kresge Gymnasium, Whitehouse Hall, Robinson Hall, and the six fraternity houses.
The Dow&#x2019;s, 150 lights were replaced by 100 fluorescent lights; using two-thirds the energy and emitting almost double the amount of light.
The sensors turn on lighting only when a room is occupied.
The conversion of exterior lighting to HPS (high pressure sodium) is made for maximum energy efficiency.
Interior lights turn off when the monitors in the room sense a certain amount of daylight, saving energy by utilizing natural light.
<p>By 2010, the Albion College sustainability movement was in full swing.
The themed year was created to make students aware of their impact.
The year-long theme was incorporated to nearly every aspect of life on campus.
The year began with a &#x201c;Week of Impact&#x201d;, a celebration designed to kick-off the life-style change.
The Sustainability Council, the Albion College Environmental House, The Whitehouse Nature Center, and the Ecological Awareness Club were created to educate and entertain the students, the faculty, and the general public about sustainability and reducing environmental impacts.
<p>In October 2009 Albion College made history by receiving certifications from both The Michigan Turfgrass Environmental Stewardship Program (MTESP) and The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP).
Albion College is the first college among higher education institutions to earn these state certifications.
