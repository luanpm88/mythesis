<p>  <strong>City University London</strong>, usually just known in the UK as <strong>City University</strong>, is a <a>British</a> <a>university</a> based in <a>Northampton Square</a>, <a>Islington</a>, <a>London</a>.
The university has a research experience of over 100 years and has often been highly ranked for its graduate <a>employability</a> and graduate salaries.
The University's mission, as outlined in its Strategy, is to &quot;lead London in education, research and knowledge transfer for businesses and the professions&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The City University traces its origin to the Northampton Institute, established in 1894, and named after the <a>Marquess of Northampton</a>, who donated the land on which the Institute was built, between <a>Northampton Square</a> and St John Street in <a>Islington</a>.
The Institute was established to provide for the education and welfare of the local population.
It was constituted under the City of London Parochial Charities Act (1883), with the objective of &quot;the promotion of the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes&quot;.</p>
<li><a>Horology</a> (the science of time and art of clock-making)</li>
<p>In 1903-04 a separate Technical <a>Optics</a> department was established.</p>
<p>In 1909 the first students qualified for University of London BSc degrees in Engineering as internal students.</p>
<p>In 1908 the Institute was used for the <a>Olympic games</a>.</p>
<p>The Institute was designated a &quot;<a>College of Advanced Technology</a>&quot; in 1957.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|220px|Northampton Square in front of the main university building</a> The Chancellor of the University is the <a>Lord Mayor of the City of London</a> <a>ex officio</a>.
For a number of years, students have taken part in the annual <a>Lord Mayor's Show</a>, representing the University in one of the country's largest and liveliest parades.
The day-to-day running of the university is the responsibility of the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>.
The University is organised into seven schools:</p>
<li><a>City Law School</a>, incorporating <a>Inns of Court School of Law</a></li>
<li><a>School of Community and Health Sciences</a>, incorporating <a>St Bartholomew School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery</a></li>
<li>School of Arts, including the <a>Department of Journalism</a></li>
<li><a>Sir John Cass Business School</a></li>
<p>The University offers <a>Bachelor's</a>, <a>Master's</a>, and <a>Doctoral</a> <a>degrees</a> as well as certificates and diplomas at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.
More than two thirds of City's programmes are recognised by the appropriate <a>professional bodies</a> such as the <a>BCS</a>, <a>BPS</a>, <a>CILIP</a>, <a>ICE</a>, <a>RICS</a> etc. in recognition of the high standards of relevance to the professions.
Its Legal Practice Course has the highest quality rating from the <a>Solicitors Regulation Authority</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1976 City has been home to a centre for the education of journalists, the highly-regarded <a>Department of Journalism</a>.
It has the UK's first chair in reporting, the <a>Anthony Sampson</a> professorship.</p>
<p>Simfonec was launched in March 2003 by the <a>Department of Trade and Industry</a> (DTI).
Simfonec was created through four of London's leading universities (<a>Royal Veterinary College</a>, <a>King's College London</a>, <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a> and City University London) as a collaborative Science Enterprise Centre (SEC) for the exploitation and transfer of knowledge, ideas and resources among three key sectors - academic, financial and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
Simfonec encourages the development of an entrepreneurial outlook amongst researchers in science and technology and orchestrates the delivery of science ideas to the commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>In September 2006, City joined the Willis Research Network (WRN), a major, long-term partnership between leading international scientific institutions (including the universities of <a>Bristol</a>, <a>Cambridge</a>, <a>Durham</a> and <a>Imperial College London</a>) and the global insurance broker, <a>Willis Group Holdings</a>.
The purpose of the network is to evaluate the frequency, severity and impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and terrorism.</p>
<p>City University London and <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a> were awarded Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) status by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE) in recognition of their work in skills training for 3,000 students across six healthcare professions.</p>
It was established in 2004 to foster collaboration and to promote and support the exchange of knowledge between the consortium&#x2019;s partners and London&#x2019;s arts and cultural sectors.
The nine institutions involved are: <a>University of the Arts London</a>; <a>Birkbeck, University of London</a>; City University London;  <a>The Courtauld Institute of Art</a>; <a>Goldsmiths, University of London</a>; <a>Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama</a>; <a>King&#x2019;s College London</a>; <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a> and <a>Royal Holloway, University of London</a>.</p>
<p>City University London became the first UK member of the Hanover Research Council (HRC) - a Washington DC based research firm serving more than 17 Industries and over 100 American <a>higher education</a> institutions.</p>
<p>The University has excellent links with businesses in the <a>City of London</a>.
City University London has also joined forces with other universities such as <a>Queen Mary</a> and the <a>Institute of Education</a> (both part of the <a>University of London</a>) with which it jointly delivers several leading degree programmes.</p>
<p>The University is the birthplace of City Technology plc (an <a>LSE</a> listed spin-out of City University London), the world's leading manufacturer of fuel-cell gas sensors used in worker safety, automotive, medical and emissions monitoring applications.
