established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Montpellier</strong> () was a <a>French</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Montpellier</a> in the <a>Languedoc-Roussillon</a> <a>r&#x00e9;gion</a> of the south of France.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Its present-day successor universities are the <a>University of Montpellier 1</a>, <a>Montpellier 2 University</a> and <a>Paul Val&#x00e9;ry University, Montpellier III</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university is considerably older than its formal founding date, associated with a <a>bull</a> issued by <a>Pope Nicholas IV</a> in 1289, combining all the long-existing schools into a university.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It is not known exactly when the schools of liberal arts were founded that developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the <a>Gallo-Roman</a> schools that gathered around masters of rhetoric.
established$$$@@@%%%The school of law was founded by <a>Placentinus</a>, from the school of law at <a>Bologna</a>, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192.
students$$$@@@%%%The faculty of law has had a long career.
established$$$@@@%%%Professors from Montpellier were prominent in the drafting of the <a>Napoleonic Code</a>, the civil code by which France is still guided and a foundation for modern law codes wherever Napoleonic influence extended.
established$$$@@@%%%The faculty of law was reorganized in 1998.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The famous school of medicine was founded perhaps by people trained in the Spanish medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier.
established$$$@@@%%%The school of medicine owed its success to a policy of the Guilhem <a>lords of Montpellier</a>, by which any licensed physician might lecture there: with no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures multiplied, and there was a great choice of teachers.
established$$$@@@%%%The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal <a>Conrad von Urach</a>, legate of <a>Pope Honorius III</a>, which were confirmed and extended in 1240, placed this school under the direction of the <a>Bishop of Maguelonne</a>, but the school enjoyed a great deal of <em>de facto</em> autonomy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, <a>Nostradamus</a> entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine.
established$$$@@@%%%He was expelled shortly afterwards when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a &quot;manual trade&quot; expressly banned by the university statutes.[8]
established$$$@@@%%%The expulsion document (BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87) still exists in the faculty library.
students$$$@@@%%%<a>Rabelais</a> took his medical degree at Montpellier, and his portrait hangs among the gallery of professors.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Jardin des plantes de Montpellier</a>, founded in 1593, is the oldest <a>botanical garden</a> in France.
established$$$@@@%%%It was in this school that the biological theory of <a>vitalism</a>, elaborated by <a>Barthez</a> (1734-1806), had its origin.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>French Revolution</a> did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Benedictine</a> monastery that had been converted into the bishop's palace, was given to house the medical school in 1795.
established$$$@@@%%%A gallery devoted to the portraits of professors since 1239 contains one of Rabelais.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school of theology had its origins in lectures in the convents: St. <a>Anthony of Padua</a>, <a>Raymundus Lullus</a>, and the Dominican <a>Bernard de la Treille</a> all lectured.
established$$$@@@%%%Two letters of <a>King John II</a> prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January, 1350.
established$$$@@@%%%By a Bull of 17 December, 1421, <a>Pope Martin V</a> granted <a>canonical institution</a> to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 16th century the local triumph of Calvinism interrupted the somewhat somnolent Catholic school of theology, which was reinstated in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and <a>Jesuits</a> interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution.
established$$$@@@%%%In better days, among Montpellier's illustrious pupils of law were <a>Petrarch</a>, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers were <a>William of Nogaret</a>, chancellor to <a>Philip IV</a>, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards <a>Pope Urban V</a>, and Pedro de Luna, afterwards antipope <a>Benedict XIII</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Like all other provincial universities of France, that of Montpellier was suppressed at the outbreak of the <a>French Revolution</a> in 1793.
established$$$@@@%%%The faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880.
established$$$@@@%%%The university of Montpellier was officially refounded in 1969.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>The University today</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The modern <a>University of Montpellier II</a> concentrates in science and technology.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Paul Val&#x00e9;ry University, Montpellier III</a> completes the trio of universities in the old city.</p>
