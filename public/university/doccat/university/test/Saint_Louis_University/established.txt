Founded in 1818 by the Most Reverend <a>Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg</a>  SLU is the oldest university west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.
It is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>.
Its undergraduate program is currently ranked 88th in the 2010 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> rankings of &quot;<a>America's Best Colleges</a>.&quot;
Its average class size is 23 and the student-faculty ratio is 12:1.</p>
<p>Its <a>Madrid, Spain</a>, campus has from 600-650 students, a faculty of 110, an average class size of 18 and a student-faculty ratio of 8:1.
<p>Saint Louis University (SLU) is located on Lindell Boulevard, originally outside the <a>City of St. Louis</a> in what has been called <a>Camp Jackson</a>, and is the second-oldest Jesuit college in the nation (only <a>Georgetown University</a> has been in existence longer).
The first <a>M.D.</a> degree awarded west of the <a>Mississippi</a> was conferred by Saint Louis University in 1836.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>[[File:Sluig.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Statue of [[Saint Ignatius]] at SLU.]] Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on 16 November 1818 by the Most Reverend <a>Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg</a>, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed under the charge of the Reverend Fran&#x00e7;ois Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the <a>Saint Louis Cathedral</a>.
Its first location was in a private residence located near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the <a>Jefferson National Expansion Memorial</a>.</p>
<p>Already having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's personal library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as <a>St.
In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus, not long after which it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature.
<p>In 1867 after the <a>American Civil War</a> it purchased &quot;Lindell's Grove&quot; to be the site of its current campus.
Lindell's Grove was the site of the <a>Camp Jackson Affair</a> in 1861 at the beginning of the war.
The affair turned into a riot in which 28 were killed and was to lead to the Union government marching through the state to evict at point of arms the state's elected governor <a>Claiborne Fox Jackson</a>.</p>
<p>The first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889.</p>
<p><a>thumb|280px|right|NE quarter of the Frost Campus of Saint Louis University, including Parks College of Engineering, Aviation, and Technology.</a>During the early 1940s, many local priests, especially the Jesuits, began to challenge the <a>segregationist</a> policies at the city's Catholic colleges and parochial schools.
After the <em><a>Pittsburgh Courier</a></em>, an African-American newspaper, ran a 1944 expose on St. Louis Archbishop <a>John J. Glennon's</a> interference with the admittance of a black student at the local <a>Webster College</a>, Father Claude Heithaus, professor of Classical Archaeology at Saint Louis University, delivered an angry sermon accusing his own institution of immoral behavior in its segregation policies.
By summer of 1944, Saint Louis University had opened its doors to <a>African American</a>s, after its president, Father Patrick Holloran, secured Glennon's reluctant approval.</p>
<p>During the past twenty years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis.
Some of the highlights of Biondi's tenure at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in enhancements and expansions including the major expansion of the <a>John Cook School of Business</a>; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to <a>Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology</a>; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center.
Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave.
and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall.
Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center in 2007 and the on-campus <a>Chaifetz Arena</a> in 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, for over thirty years the university has maintained a campus in <a>Madrid</a>, <a>Spain</a> with a student body of around 700.
The Madrid campus was the first freestanding campus operated by an American university in Europe and the first American institution to be recognized by Spain's higher education authority as an official foreign university.
In the early 1970s, the campus was the site of an emerging new stream of Bible-based liturgical music that has enjoyed a worldwide impact.
The composers were known as the <a>St.
<p>In 1967, Saint Louis University became one of the first Catholic universities to increase layperson decision making power.
This was largely instituted due to the landmark <a>Maryland Court of Appeals</a> case, Horace Mann vs. the Board of Public Works of Maryland, in which grants to &quot;largely sectarian&quot; colleges were declared unconstitutional.
The <a>Second Vatican Council</a> has also been mentioned as a major influence on this decision for its increased focus on the laity, as well as the decreased recruitment of nuns and priests since the council.</p>
<p>Since the move to lay oversight, debate has erupted many times over how much influence the Roman Catholic Church should have on the affairs of the university.
The decision by the University to sell its hospital to <a>Tenet Healthcare Corp.</a> in 1997 met much resistance by both local and national Church leaders, but went ahead as planned.

The Spaulding Athletic Almanac of 1905 offers this commentary: &#x201c;The (Olympic) Department knew perfectly well that it would be unable to have an Olympic Foot Ball Championship, though it felt incumbent to advertise it.
The only college that seemed absolutely willing to give up its financial interests to play for the World&#x2019;s Fair Championship was the St. Louis University and there is more apparently in this honor than appears in this report.
There were many exhibition contests held in the Stadium under the auspices of the Department wherein teams from the St. Louis University and <a>Washington University</a> took part and competed against other teams from universities east and west of the Mississippi River.
The Missouri-<a>Purdue</a> game was played in the Stadium on October 28&#x2026;..

As part of the First Year Experience (FYE) program, resident freshman students are required to live on campus (unless a commuter from the Saint Louis area) for the first two years of their careers at SLU, before being released to move into Upperclassmen or off-campus housing.
The sophomore residency requirement caused controversy when initiated in the 2009-10 school year, as the University lacked adequate housing to house all sophomores and upperclassmen who requested on-campus housing.
Around 1000 juniors and seniors were pushed off campus when sophomores were granted access to traditionally Junior and Senior housing options.
In the 2010-11 school year, the school announced the transfer of the Student Housing Scholarship (of $1,000 to $2,000) to Tuition Scholarship, which made off-campus housing more affordable and pursued by upperclassmen.</p>
<p><a>thumb|180px|right|Griesedieck Hall</a> The Griesedieck Complex (also known as &quot;Gries&quot;, pronounced &quot;greez&quot;) contains 16 stories of living space in its main building, with additional dorm space in its two wings, Walsh and Clemens.
Reinert Hall, named after Jesuit Father Paul C. Reinert, is located two blocks south of the main campus in a converted <a>Marriott</a> hotel.
Where the building lacks in location it makes up for in living space, containing some of the largest dormitories across the country, 12' 1&quot; by 27', complete with private full baths in each room, though each room houses three to four roommates.
SLU does not have Greek houses on campus; however, the Sigma Chi chapter owns a house located less than a block from campus, and DeMattias Hall acts as a Greek dormitory and de facto community House.
While many honors students once chose to live here, in 2008 it was changed to &quot;The Language Villa,&quot; where foreign students and language students can live together.
The choice of moving the foreign and language students from the Language Houses on Laclede Street to Notre Dame Hall created some controversy in both the language and honors communities.
Another dorm option is Fusz Hall, catercorner to the University's Clocktower.
Because of its proximity to the <a>Chaifetz Arena</a>, many student-athletes live in Grand Forest.
The Village is also very close to the local SLU bars &#x2013; <a>Humphrey's</a> and Laclede's&#x2014;making it an especially popular location for juniors and seniors.
It is designed to be a <a>green building</a> and is named for <a>Edward Adelbert Doisy</a>, <a>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> laureate of 1943 and a long-time faculty member at SLU's medical school.
The building had its official dedication ceremony on December 7, 2007, with faculty and staff having begun to move in during the previous weeks.
<p>In July of 2010, the Edward A. Doisy Research Center became home to the <a>Center for World Health and Medicine</a>, a non-profit drug discovery group dedicated to developing therapies for orphan and neglected diseases.</p>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Chaifetz Arena</a> The multi-purpose <a>arena</a>, construction of which was completed in early April 2008 at a cost of $80.5 million, contains 10,600 seats for basketball, a training facility, state-of-the-art locker rooms, and a practice facility that can house an additional 1,000 spectators.
On February 28, 2007, the arena was named in honor of University alumnus (1975) Dr.
Richard A. Chaifetz, founder and CEO of ComPsych Corp., who made a $12 million naming rights gift to the Arena.

<p>The school recently unveiled plans for a new building.
The school is currently attempting to raise the estimated $30&#x2013;35 million necessary, with groundbreaking being estimated to begin in 2010.

The school has heavily invested in its on-campus athletic facilities in the past twenty years with the creation of <a>Hermann Stadium</a> and <a>Chaifetz Arena</a>.
<p>On several occasions, controversies have arisen when student groups organized events that SLU considered to be inconsistent with its Catholic, Jesuit mission.
In 2010, in addition to the off campus production of Ensler's Monologues, Una produced the SLU Monologues, a collection of stories from the student body based on the style of the Vagina Monologues.</li>
<li><strong>The All of Us Campaign</strong>: In the spring of 2009, controversy arose when SLU's Rainbow Alliance, a student organization supporting and advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender members of the SLU community, attempted to organize a straight ally program called the All of Us Campaign.
SLU administrators took issue with the campaign's position on same-sex marriage, which they argued to be contradictory to the Jesuit mission.
The conflict was resolved when organizers of the All of Us Campaign negotiated with administrators to develop a new pledge which was acceptable to both parties.
