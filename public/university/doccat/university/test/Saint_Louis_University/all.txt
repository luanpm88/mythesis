established$$$@@@%%%<h3>History</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>[[File:Sluig.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Statue of [[Saint Ignatius]] at SLU.]] Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on 16 November 1818 by the Most Reverend <a>Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg</a>, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed under the charge of the Reverend Fran&#x00e7;ois Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the <a>Saint Louis Cathedral</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Its first location was in a private residence located near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the <a>Jefferson National Expansion Memorial</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Already having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's personal library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as <a>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Louis University High School</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus, not long after which it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1867 after the <a>American Civil War</a> it purchased &quot;Lindell's Grove&quot; to be the site of its current campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Lindell's Grove was the site of the <a>Camp Jackson Affair</a> in 1861 at the beginning of the war.
established$$$@@@%%%The affair turned into a riot in which 28 were killed and was to lead to the Union government marching through the state to evict at point of arms the state's elected governor <a>Claiborne Fox Jackson</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%After the <em><a>Pittsburgh Courier</a></em>, an African-American newspaper, ran a 1944 expose on St. Louis Archbishop <a>John J. Glennon's</a> interference with the admittance of a black student at the local <a>Webster College</a>, Father Claude Heithaus, professor of Classical Archaeology at Saint Louis University, delivered an angry sermon accusing his own institution of immoral behavior in its segregation policies.
established$$$@@@%%%By summer of 1944, Saint Louis University had opened its doors to <a>African American</a>s, after its president, Father Patrick Holloran, secured Glennon's reluctant approval.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Expansion</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the past twenty years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis.
established$$$@@@%%%Some of the highlights of Biondi's tenure at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in enhancements and expansions including the major expansion of the <a>John Cook School of Business</a>; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to <a>Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology</a>; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center.
established$$$@@@%%%Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%(between Lindell Blvd.
established$$$@@@%%%and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall.
established$$$@@@%%%Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center in 2007 and the on-campus <a>Chaifetz Arena</a> in 2008.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<pre></pre>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition, for over thirty years the university has maintained a campus in <a>Madrid</a>, <a>Spain</a> with a student body of around 700.
established$$$@@@%%%The Madrid campus was the first freestanding campus operated by an American university in Europe and the first American institution to be recognized by Spain's higher education authority as an official foreign university.
established$$$@@@%%%In the early 1970s, the campus was the site of an emerging new stream of Bible-based liturgical music that has enjoyed a worldwide impact.
established$$$@@@%%%The composers were known as the <a>St.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1967, Saint Louis University became one of the first Catholic universities to increase layperson decision making power.
affiliation$$$@@@%%%At the time, then board chairman <a>Fr.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Paul Reinert, SJ</a>, stepped aside to be replaced by layman Daniel Schlafly.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The board also shifted to an 18 to 10 majority of laypeople.
established$$$@@@%%%This was largely instituted due to the landmark <a>Maryland Court of Appeals</a> case, Horace Mann vs. the Board of Public Works of Maryland, in which grants to &quot;largely sectarian&quot; colleges were declared unconstitutional.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Second Vatican Council</a> has also been mentioned as a major influence on this decision for its increased focus on the laity, as well as the decreased recruitment of nuns and priests since the council.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>From 1985 to 1992 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees was <a>William H.T. Bush</a> (younger brother of former President <a>George H. W. Bush</a>).
website$$$@@@%%%The younger Bush also taught classes at the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since the move to lay oversight, debate has erupted many times over how much influence the Roman Catholic Church should have on the affairs of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%The decision by the University to sell its hospital to <a>Tenet Healthcare Corp.</a> in 1997 met much resistance by both local and national Church leaders, but went ahead as planned.
