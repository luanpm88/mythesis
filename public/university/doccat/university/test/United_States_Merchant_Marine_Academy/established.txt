<h2>History</h2>
<p>Between 1874 and 1936, diverse federal legislation supported maritime training through schoolships, internships at sea and other methods.
A disastrous fire in 1934 aboard the passenger ship <a>SS <em>Morro Castle</em></a>, in which 134 lives were lost, convinced the <a>U.S. Congress</a> that direct federal involvement in efficient and standardized training was needed.</p>
<p>Congress passed the landmark <a>Merchant Marine Act in 1936</a>, and two years later, the <a>U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps</a> was established.
The first training was given at temporary facilities until the Academy's permanent site in <a>Kings Point, New York</a> was acquired in early 1942.
Construction of the Academy began immediately, and 15 months later the task was virtually completed.
The Academy was dedicated on September 30, 1943, by <a>President Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who noted that &quot;the Academy serves the Merchant Marine as West Point serves the Army and Annapolis the Navy.&quot;</p>
<p><a>World War II</a> required the Academy to forego its normal operation and to devote all of its resources toward meeting the emergency need for Merchant Marine officers.
Its enrollment rose to 2,700 men, and the planned course of instruction was reduced in length from four years to 18 months.
To meet the wartime needs for qualified merchant marine officers two additional merchant marine cadet training school sites were established, one located in Pass Christian, MS and the other in San Mateo, CA.
The San Mateo location was closed in September 1947 and the students transfered to Kings Point.
The location in Pass Christian, MS was similarly closed in 1950.
In spite of the war, shipboard training continued to be an integral part of the Academy curriculum, and midshipmen served at sea in combat zones the world over.
As the war drew to a close, plans were made to convert the Academy's wartime curriculum to a four-year, college-level program to meet the peacetime requirements of the merchant marine.
<p>Authorization for awarding the degree of <a>bachelor of science</a> to graduates was granted by Congress in 1949.
The Academy became a fully-accredited as a degree-granting institution in the same year.
It was made a permanent institution by an <a>Act of Congress</a> in 1956.
It was involved in such programs as training US officers for the nuclear-powered merchant ship, the <em><a>NS Savannah</a></em>.</p>
<p>Admission requirements were amended in 1974, and this Academy became the first federal service academy to enroll female students, two years before the <a>Military</a>, <a>Naval</a>, <a>Air Force</a>, and <a>Coast Guard</a> Academies.</p>
<p>During the <a>Persian Gulf war</a> in early 1991, and for many months prior to the war, both Academy graduates and midshipmen played important roles in the large <a>sealift</a> of military supplies to the <a>Middle East</a>.
Midshipmen training at sea also participated in the humanitarian sealift to <a>Somalia</a> during <a>Operation Restore Hope</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990, the Academy acquired its largest campus based training vessel, the <a>T/V</a> <em><a>Kings Pointer</a></em>.
<p>During the 1990s, the Academy's future seemed to be in doubt, since its elimination was recommended by the <a><em>National Performance Review</em></a> efforts of the Clinton presidential Administration, whose chairman was Vice President <a>Albert Gore, Jr.</a></p>
Many graduates were involved in the transportation of supplies during the buildup to the war in 2003.
Many graduates in the Naval Reserve have been called to serve supporting naval roles in ports in Iraq and Kuwait.
Graduates who have entered other branches of the service have had more direct roles in Iraq.
<a>Aaron Seesan</a>, a 2003 graduate and Army Lieutenant, was the first graduate to give his life for his country during a war since the <a>Vietnam War</a>.</p>
<p>On 19 June 2006, President <a>George W. Bush</a> gave the commencement address at the Academy.
He was the first serving President to visit this Academy.</p>
<p>In addition to requiring strong GPA and SAT/ACT scores, the Academy, along with all of the other federal service academies except the <a>United States Coast Guard Academy</a>, requires that the candidate be nominated by a U.S. Representative or U.S. Senator.</p>
<p>Applicants are required to write an essay, get letters of recommendation from three sources (including one from their guidance counselor), take the DoDMERB (Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board) physical, and take a physical fitness exam called the Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA).</p>
<p>The Academy is funded by the <a>US Department of Transportation's</a> <a>Maritime Administration</a> and is administered by the <a>United States Maritime Service</a>.</p>
<p>The entire student body is referred to as the Regiment of Midshipmen.
<p><a>right|thumb|Cadets paying a traditional visit to Amphitrite at Kings Point</a> Freshmen, known as <a>plebe</a>s, start in early July where they begin a two and a half week indoctrination period, also known as &quot;indoc.&quot;
This high stress period involves physical training, marching, and an intensive introduction to regimental life at the academy.
In September, first year students officially become <a>Midshipmen</a> upon taking the oath of office into the <a>U.S. Navy Reserve</a> on Acceptance Day.
Until &quot;recognized&quot; later in the academic year, plebes continue to be required to adhere to stringent rules affecting most aspects of their daily life.</p>
<p>Academy students, known as midshipmen, focus on one of two different <a>ship transport</a> areas of education: marine transportation or <a>marine engineering</a>.
Transportation students learn about ship <a>navigation</a>, cargo handling, <a>navigation rules</a> and <a>maritime law</a>.
Engineering students learn about the function of the ship's engines and its supporting systems.
Maritime Operations and Technology majors, also referred to as &quot;Shoppers&quot;, are eligible to seek and obtain certification as &quot;Qualified Members of Engine Department&quot; (QMED) - the highest unlicensed rating in the engine department.
<p>For part of <a>sophomore</a> and junior year, known at the Academy as third class and second class year, students work as <a>cadet</a>s on regular American merchant ships.
Midshipmen work and function as part of the crew and gain an opportunity for generous amounts of hands-on experience as well as the opportunity to travel abroad to many different foreign ports.
The average midshipman travels to 18 countries during this period, which totals a minimum of 300 days.
Due to this absence from the Academy, the remaining three academic years span from late July, through mid-June.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1st class (senior) year, midshipmen prepare for exams to be licensed as either <a>Third Assistant Engineer</a>s (steam and motor unlimited HP) or <a>Third Mate</a>s (any gross tons, oceans).
In Rugby, the USMMA competes in the MetNy Rugby Football Union where the team was first division champion from 2005-2006.</p>
<p>The USMMA Varsity Intercollegiate Sailing Team competes at the Division I level and is a member of MAISA, Mid Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and has fifteen Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) national championships to its credit, as well as nearly two dozen district titles.
The Mariners have four dinghy championships in 1979, 1983, 1984, and 1987.
Six sailors have received College Sailor of the Year recognition, Jonathan Wright 1971, Alex Smigelski 1979, Morgan Reeser, 1983 &amp; 1984, Jay Renehan 1985, William Hardesty III, 1998.
<p>The <a>Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal</a> is the highest award which can be bestowed upon members of the United States Merchant Marine and is the service&#x2019;s equivalent of the <a>Medal of Honor</a>.
<p>Since USMMA opened in 1943 eight cadet/midshipmen have been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.</p>
Unlike the nation's other military academies, graduates of USMMA are required to fulfill their service obligation on their own by providing annual proof of employment in a wide variety of occupations as approved by <a>MARAD</a> for a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Graduates may elect to fulfill their service obligation by working as licensed officers on U.S. flagged merchant vessels, as civilians in the maritime industry, or as active duty officers in any branch of the <a>armed forces</a> of the United States.
<li>On average about 1/3 of each graduating class goes to sea working in the <a>United States Merchant Marine</a> as officers serving on ships in overseas trade, inland &amp; near-coastal transportation, research vessels, and other types of vessels.</li>
Of those going on active duty most enter the <a>US Navy</a> as <a>Naval Aviator</a>s, <a>Naval Flight Officer</a>s, <a>Surface Warfare Officer</a>s, <a>Submarine Officer</a>s or occasionally even as <a>SEALs</a>.
Midshipmen may also apply for commissions in the <a>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) with the <a>NOAA Commissioned Corps</a>.</li>
Graduates who choose military service, must serve at least five years in the active duty force of their respective service.</li>
<p> The USMMA in <a>Kings Point, New York</a> is also the home of the <strong><a>American Merchant Marine Museum</a></strong>.
The museum houses the Academy's collection of maritime art and artifacts.
The museum contains a learning center which is open to the regiment and the public, as well as a number of exhibits including the only known <a>back-acting</a> engine still in existence, that of the former <a>gunboat</a> .</p>
<p>The museum also houses the <strong><a>National Maritime Hall of Fame</a></strong>.
The only permanent exhibit of its kind in the nation, the Hall of Fame honors people and ships important to American oceanic, coastal, inland waterway and Great Lakes shipping.
The hall inducted its first set of members in or about 1982.</p>
In addition, one of the five surrender swords presented by the Japanese to <a>Douglas MacArthur</a> at the conclusion of World War II is housed there.</p>
