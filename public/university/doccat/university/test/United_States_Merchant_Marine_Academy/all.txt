country$$$@@@%%%<p> <a>thumb|right|350px|Aerial view of United States Merchant Marine Academy</a>  The <strong>United States Merchant Marine Academy</strong> (also known as <strong>USMMA</strong> or <strong>Kings Point</strong>) is one of the five <a>United States service academies</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%It is charged with training officers for the <a>United States Merchant Marine</a>, branches of the military, or the transportation industry.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Midshipmen (as students at the Academy are called) are trained in <a>marine engineering</a>, <a>navigation</a>, ship's administration, <a>maritime law</a>, <a>personnel management</a>, <a>international law</a>, <a>customs</a>, and many other subjects important to the task of running a large ship.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Between 1874 and 1936, diverse federal legislation supported maritime training through schoolships, internships at sea and other methods.
established$$$@@@%%%A disastrous fire in 1934 aboard the passenger ship <a>SS <em>Morro Castle</em></a>, in which 134 lives were lost, convinced the <a>U.S. Congress</a> that direct federal involvement in efficient and standardized training was needed.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Congress passed the landmark <a>Merchant Marine Act in 1936</a>, and two years later, the <a>U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps</a> was established.
established$$$@@@%%%The first training was given at temporary facilities until the Academy's permanent site in <a>Kings Point, New York</a> was acquired in early 1942.
established$$$@@@%%%Construction of the Academy began immediately, and 15 months later the task was virtually completed.
established$$$@@@%%%The Academy was dedicated on September 30, 1943, by <a>President Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who noted that &quot;the Academy serves the Merchant Marine as West Point serves the Army and Annapolis the Navy.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>World War II</a> required the Academy to forego its normal operation and to devote all of its resources toward meeting the emergency need for Merchant Marine officers.
established$$$@@@%%%Its enrollment rose to 2,700 men, and the planned course of instruction was reduced in length from four years to 18 months.
established$$$@@@%%%To meet the wartime needs for qualified merchant marine officers two additional merchant marine cadet training school sites were established, one located in Pass Christian, MS and the other in San Mateo, CA.
established$$$@@@%%%The San Mateo location was closed in September 1947 and the students transfered to Kings Point.
established$$$@@@%%%The location in Pass Christian, MS was similarly closed in 1950.
established$$$@@@%%%In spite of the war, shipboard training continued to be an integral part of the Academy curriculum, and midshipmen served at sea in combat zones the world over.
mascot$$$@@@%%%One hundred and forty-two midshipmen gave their lives in service to their country, and many others survived torpedo and aerial attacks.
country$$$@@@%%%From 1942-1945, the Academy graduated 6,895 officers.
established$$$@@@%%%As the war drew to a close, plans were made to convert the Academy's wartime curriculum to a four-year, college-level program to meet the peacetime requirements of the merchant marine.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1948, such a course was instituted.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Authorization for awarding the degree of <a>bachelor of science</a> to graduates was granted by Congress in 1949.
established$$$@@@%%%The Academy became a fully-accredited as a degree-granting institution in the same year.
established$$$@@@%%%It was made a permanent institution by an <a>Act of Congress</a> in 1956.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The Academy accelerated graduating classes during the <a>Korean War</a> and the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was involved in such programs as training US officers for the nuclear-powered merchant ship, the <em><a>NS Savannah</a></em>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Admission requirements were amended in 1974, and this Academy became the first federal service academy to enroll female students, two years before the <a>Military</a>, <a>Naval</a>, <a>Air Force</a>, and <a>Coast Guard</a> Academies.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the <a>Persian Gulf war</a> in early 1991, and for many months prior to the war, both Academy graduates and midshipmen played important roles in the large <a>sealift</a> of military supplies to the <a>Middle East</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Midshipmen training at sea also participated in the humanitarian sealift to <a>Somalia</a> during <a>Operation Restore Hope</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1990, the Academy acquired its largest campus based training vessel, the <a>T/V</a> <em><a>Kings Pointer</a></em>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The ship still serves the academy to this day.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1990s, the Academy's future seemed to be in doubt, since its elimination was recommended by the <a><em>National Performance Review</em></a> efforts of the Clinton presidential Administration, whose chairman was Vice President <a>Albert Gore, Jr.</a></p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>Most recently, Merchant Marine Academy midshipmen and graduates have been involved in many facets of the war in Iraq.
established$$$@@@%%%Many graduates were involved in the transportation of supplies during the buildup to the war in 2003.
established$$$@@@%%%Many graduates in the Naval Reserve have been called to serve supporting naval roles in ports in Iraq and Kuwait.
established$$$@@@%%%Graduates who have entered other branches of the service have had more direct roles in Iraq.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Aaron Seesan</a>, a 2003 graduate and Army Lieutenant, was the first graduate to give his life for his country during a war since the <a>Vietnam War</a>.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Due to the service of Midshipmen in every major conflict the country has been involved in since World War II, the regiment is privileged to carry a regimental battle standard.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Merchant Marine Academy is the only Federal Service Academy granted the right to do so, and the standard is carried with the colors at all times.

established$$$@@@%%%He was the first serving President to visit this Academy.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Admissions</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to requiring strong GPA and SAT/ACT scores, the Academy, along with all of the other federal service academies except the <a>United States Coast Guard Academy</a>, requires that the candidate be nominated by a U.S. Representative or U.S. Senator.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Applicants are required to write an essay, get letters of recommendation from three sources (including one from their guidance counselor), take the DoDMERB (Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board) physical, and take a physical fitness exam called the Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA).</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Organization</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Academy is funded by the <a>US Department of Transportation's</a> <a>Maritime Administration</a> and is administered by the <a>United States Maritime Service</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The entire student body is referred to as the Regiment of Midshipmen.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Regiment is subdivided into two battalions and six companies: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Band, with First and Second Companies making up First Battalion and Third, Fourth, and Fifth Companies making up Second Battalion.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Company assignment is random, although candidates who admit to having experience playing a musical instrument when they report to the Academy are steered towards joining Band Company.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Curriculum</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|Cadets paying a traditional visit to Amphitrite at Kings Point</a> Freshmen, known as <a>plebe</a>s, start in early July where they begin a two and a half week indoctrination period, also known as &quot;indoc.&quot;
country$$$@@@%%%Indoc is functionally run by upperclassmen but is overseen by officers of the United States Maritime Service who are part of the Commandant of Midshipman's staff.
established$$$@@@%%%This high stress period involves physical training, marching, and an intensive introduction to regimental life at the academy.
image_size$$$@@@%%%After the indoctrination period is completed, the academic year begins.
established$$$@@@%%%In September, first year students officially become <a>Midshipmen</a> upon taking the oath of office into the <a>U.S. Navy Reserve</a> on Acceptance Day.
established$$$@@@%%%Until &quot;recognized&quot; later in the academic year, plebes continue to be required to adhere to stringent rules affecting most aspects of their daily life.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Academy students, known as midshipmen, focus on one of two different <a>ship transport</a> areas of education: marine transportation or <a>marine engineering</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Transportation students learn about ship <a>navigation</a>, cargo handling, <a>navigation rules</a> and <a>maritime law</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Engineering students learn about the function of the ship's engines and its supporting systems.
vice-president$$$@@@%%%There are currently six different academic majors available to midshipmen.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Three of them are referred to as &quot;Deck Majors&quot; because in addition to a Bachelor of Science degree in the major field of study: Marine Transportation, Logistics and Intermodal Transportation, and Maritime Operations and Technology; they sit for and upon successful completion of the examination are issued a Third Mate (Deck Officer) License of Steam or Motor Vessels, Unlimited Tonnage, Upon Oceans.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The other three available curricula are referred to as &quot;Engine Majors&quot;; they are: Marine Engineering, Marine Engineering Systems, and Marine Engineering and Shipyard Management.
country$$$@@@%%%&quot;Engine Majors&quot; sit for and upon successful completion of the examination are issued Third Assistant Engineer (3 A/E - Engineering Officer) Licenses Steam and Motor Vessels, Any Horsepower.
established$$$@@@%%%Maritime Operations and Technology majors, also referred to as &quot;Shoppers&quot;, are eligible to seek and obtain certification as &quot;Qualified Members of Engine Department&quot; (QMED) - the highest unlicensed rating in the engine department.
country$$$@@@%%%Marine Engineering Systems and Marine Engineering Systems &amp; Shipyard Management graduates are also qualified to sit for the Engineer In Training (EIT) examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>For part of <a>sophomore</a> and junior year, known at the Academy as third class and second class year, students work as <a>cadet</a>s on regular American merchant ships.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Midshipmen are typically paired two to a ship, one engineering cadet and one deck cadet.
established$$$@@@%%%Midshipmen work and function as part of the crew and gain an opportunity for generous amounts of hands-on experience as well as the opportunity to travel abroad to many different foreign ports.
established$$$@@@%%%The average midshipman travels to 18 countries during this period, which totals a minimum of 300 days.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to this absence from the Academy, the remaining three academic years span from late July, through mid-June.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Toward the end of 1st class (senior) year, midshipmen prepare for exams to be licensed as either <a>Third Assistant Engineer</a>s (steam and motor unlimited HP) or <a>Third Mate</a>s (any gross tons, oceans).
