<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Jackson Male Academy was founded in 1823 just after West Tennessee was opened for settlement .
Only five years earlier in 1818 was the land purchased from the <a>Chickasaw</a> Indians.</p>
<p>Southwestern soon changed its name to Union University in honor of the Eatons and others from Union at Murfreesboro who had impacted Southwestern as faculty, administrators, trustees, and contributors.
<p>In 1925 the Tennessee Baptist Convention secured a charter that vested the rights, authority, and property of Union University in the Tennessee Convention.
<p>In 1948 the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted Union University accreditation.
<p>In 1962 Union developed a nursing program with the assistance of <a>Jackson-Madison County General Hospital</a> at the request of local physicians.</p>
<p>In 1975 Union moved from downtown <a>Jackson, Tennessee</a>, to a new campus located near the Highway 45-Bypass in north Jackson.</p>
<li>the Penick Academic Complex was enlarged several times; </li>
<li>and the Blasingame Academic Complex (1986) and the Hyran E. Barefoot Student Union Building (1994) were constructed.
<p>From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Union operated an Extension Center in the Memphis area.
From 1987-95, Union offered the degree-completion program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN track) in Memphis.
<li>headcount increase from 2200 (in 1996) to more than 3500 (in 2004); </li>
<li>increased giving to Union, including ten of the largest commitments in Union history;  </li>

<a>thumb|Radar loop of the Nashville, Jackson and Christian County, Kentucky supercells.
Those supercells were responsible for at least 32 deaths (courtesy of NWS Nashville)</a></p>
The tornado destroyed eighteen <a>dormitory</a> buildings and caused over $40 million dollars worth of damage to the campus, which  suffered a direct hit rendering almost 80% unlivable.
<p>I'm convinced-nobody will ever convince me otherwise-that God's angels were unleashed to come as minstering spirits to protect those students in the most precarious of situations.</p>
A total of 31 buildings received damage of varying degrees.
The devastation captured nation wide attention and was featured by <a>CNN</a>, <a>Fox News</a> , the <a>New York Times</a>  and numerous regional news outlets.
<a>Secretary of Homeland Security</a>, <a>Michael Chertoff</a>, <a>FEMA Director</a>, <a>R.
David Paulison</a> and Governor <a>Phil Bredesen</a> all visited the campus after the disaster.</p>
<p><a>The Commercial Appeal</a> reported that due to extensive damage, the campus would not reopen until February 18. <a>Lambuth University</a>, a rival area university, reportedly offered to open its dormitories to displaced Union students.
The congregation of Englewood Baptist Church, which owns the Old English Inn in Jackson, voted unanimously to open the Inn to Union students.
The University also expected that around 200 students would be housed in the private homes of Union faculty, staff and friends.</p>
<p>It was the second time in just over 5 years that the campus was hit by a tornado.
On the evening of November 10, 2002, during the <a>Veterans Day Weekend tornado outbreak</a>, the school was struck by an <a>F1 tornado</a>, with winds of approximately 100 miles  per hour, which did approximately 2 million dollars worth of damage to the school.
The damage caused by the February 5th tornado was estimated at $40 million.</p>
<p>Union also has a  campus in <a>Germantown, Tennessee</a>, (<a>suburb</a>an <a>Memphis</a>) offering graduate degrees in business, education, Christian studies &amp; nursing.
<p>Union's newest location is in Hendersonville, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville, TN.
<p>In early 2007, it was announced that Olford Ministries would be merged into Union University.
The Olford campus is a , wooded retreat setting in <a>Memphis, Tennessee</a>.</p>
Temporary off campus housing was at The Jett (the former Old English Inn) for the majority of the spring 2008 semester.</p>
<p>The school sponsors intercollegiate <a>sport</a>s teams that participate in the <a>NAIA</a>'s <a>TranSouth Athletic Conference</a>.
<p>Each of these groups is relatively large in size relative to the size of the institution and consistently contributes to philanthropies, both regionally and globally.
The number of members in the social fraternities can range between 50 to 80 members per chapter.</p>
