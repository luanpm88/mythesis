<p>The <strong>University of Bridgeport</strong> is a private, independent, non-sectarian, coeducational university The University is known for its diverse student population, currently ranking as the eleventh most racially diverse national university in the country by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>.</p>
<p>The University School, a high school, is also on the University's grounds.
<p>The university had financial troubles in the 1990s and was the subject of controversy when the trustees were obligated to enter into serious negotiations with and subsequently gave control of the institution to the <a>Professors World Peace Academy</a> (PWPA), an affiliate of the <a>Unification Church</a>, a <a>new religious movement</a> founded by <a>Sun Myung Moon</a> in <a>Seoul, South Korea</a> in 1954, in order to save it from closure.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University grew rapidly in the 1960s by capitalizing on the increased number of people seeking to attend a U.S. college resulting from the <a>baby boom</a>, <a>Vietnam War</a> veterans eligible for a higher education under the <a>G.I.
Bill</a>, and international students who wanted to attend college in the United States.
Enrollment declined in the 1970s and 1980s after the waves of baby boom and Vietnam era veterans eligible for the G.I. Bill declined.
More than a third of the 50 campus buildings were empty.
To cut costs, the university decided to terminate 50 tenured faculty, and asked the other faculty to accept a 30% wage cut.
In addition, the University decided to eliminate its liberal arts college, alienating many students.</p>
<p>In 1990, discussion began about affiliating or possibly merging the University with either the <a>University of New Haven</a> or <a>Sacred Heart University</a>.
The University was approached by the <a>Professors World Peace Academy</a> (PWPA), an affiliate of the <a>Unification Church</a>, but their offer to bail out the University was spurned by the trustees who said the school was &quot;not going to have anything to do with the offer&quot; and were concerned that such an affiliation would damage the University's reputation.</p>
<p>Problems continued to plague the University; enrollment fell to 1,300 in 1991.
Debt rose to over $22 million in 1991&#x2013;92.
Serious plans to merge the University with Sacred Heart fell through in 1992; the law school instead wanted to associate with <a>Quinnipiac University</a>, but Sacred Heart maintained that any takeover would have to include the law school.
The PWPA invested $50.5 million in the university on May 30, 1992, enabling the university to keep its accreditation.</pre>
<p>A two year faculty strike, started in the midst of the University's financial troubles, intensified when the trustees gave control to the PWPA.
Eventually, sixty-six professors and librarians agreed to a &quot;divorce&quot; with the University in return for compensation of up to a year's salary.
In a similar move, the law school decided to cut ties with the University, <a>Neil Albert Salonen</a>, a member of the Unification Church, was the Chairman of the University's Board of Trustees when he was chosen to serve as ninth University president in 1999.
He had earlier managed several Unification Church related organizations, and had served as President of the Unification Church of America from 1973 to 1980, and as Chairman of the <a>International Cultural Foundation</a>, prior to becoming the chief executive of the university.</p>
<p>The University of Bridgeport received funding from the PWPA from 1992 until 2002.
The University has been financially independent from PWPA since 2003.
Members of the Unification Church hold important administrative positions at the University: the University's Board of Trustees includes Gordon L. Anderson and has included <a>Chung Hwan Kwak</a>.
The PWPA considers University of Bridgeport one of its affiliates.</p>
<p>Enrollment has grown dramatically in recent years, from 1,383 total students in 1992 to 5,323 students in Fall 2008.
<p>In its 2011 rankings, University of Bridgeport placed in Tier 2 of National Universities by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>.
In its 2006 annual college rankings, <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> ranked University of Bridgeport 147th of all 245 National universities, with criteria based on research, community service, and social mobility.
