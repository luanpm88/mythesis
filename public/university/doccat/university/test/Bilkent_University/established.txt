<p>  <strong>Bilkent University</strong> is the first private, nonprofit university in <a>Turkey</a> with the fundamental aim of creating a center of excellence in higher education and research.
The name &quot;Bilkent&quot; exemplifies this aim, since it is an acronym of &quot;bilim kenti&quot;: Turkish for &quot;city of learning and science.&quot;
(10 miles) west of the center of <a>Ankara</a>, and covers an area of more than 500 hectares (1200 acres).
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bilkent University was founded on October 20, 1984 by Prof. Dr. <a>Ihsan Dogramaci</a>, through the joint resolution of Ihsan Dogramaci Education Foundation, Ihsan Dogramaci Science and Research Foundation and Ihsan Dogramaci Health Foundation.
The establishment of this private university was later approved by an act of Parliament.
The aim was to create a center of excellence in higher education and research.
<p>It had long been an objective of the founder to establish a private university distinguished by its high quality education and research.
The founder, himself an academician by profession, had earlier contributed to the establishment of numerous public institutions of higher learning and served as rector of Ankara University, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Middle East Technical University and founder and first rector of Hacettepe University.
<p>Preparations for Bilkent University had begun as early as 1967, with the purchase of a large tract of land to the west of Ankara.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s the above mentioned foundations undertook construction, on the future site of Bilkent, of the buildings which now house administrative offices, the Faculty of Engineering, and the library.
<p>From the outset, the design of the university structure provided for student union representatives to be voting members of the administrative committees of various schools, as well as of the University Senate.
Beginning in the second year of instruction, the practice of student evaluation of courses and instructors, at the time not a common practice in Turkey, was instituted.
Bilkent has student exchange agreements with the University of California system, Georgia Institute of Technology, Maryland University, Washington University, Michigan University in the USA; McGill and Montreal Universities in Canada; Tilburg and Amsterdam Universities in the Netherlands; Pforzheim and Konstanz Universities in Germany; Roma and Bacconi Universities in Italy; Southern Denmark University in Denmark; Essex University in England; Ecole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Lille and Clarmont University in France; Waikato University in New Zealand.
The university also has a communications office at the Empire State Building in New York City, equipped with interactive video conferencing capabilities.
<p>The Career Center, another service established at the incentive of Bilkent's founder early in the University's development, helps final-year students to acquire the skills necessary to apply successfully for a job.
The Center arranges interviews between representatives of major corporations and students seeking employment.
<p>Each year, more than 1,500,000 high-school graduates take the national examination to enter the state and private universities in Turkey.
<p>The faculty is from around 40 different countries.
Most of them were working in prominent universities in North America and Europe when they received offers from Bilkent University.
