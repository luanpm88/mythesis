<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was established in 1924 by <a>Mary Louise Curtis Bok</a>, and was named in honor of her father, <a>Cyrus Curtis</a>.
After consulting with musician friends including <a>Josef Hofmann</a> and <a>Leopold Stokowski</a> on how best to help musically gifted young people, Bok purchased three mansions on Philadelphia's <a>Rittenhouse Square</a> and had them joined and renovated.
She established a <a>faculty</a> of prominent performing artists and eventually left the institute with an endowment of <a>US$</a>12 million.

<p>The institute has served as a training ground for <a>orchestra</a>l players to fill the ranks of the <a>Philadelphia Orchestra</a>, much like the <a>New England Conservatory</a> serves as a training ground for the <a>Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>,  although <a>composer</a>s, <a>organist</a>s, <a>pianist</a>s and <a>singer</a>s are offered courses of study as well.
Accordingly, enrollment is in the range of 150 to 170 students.
The acceptance rate is about one third that of <a>Ivy League</a> institutions such as <a>Columbia University</a>.</p>
