<h2>History</h2>
<p> The school was founded in 1906.
However, no funds were appropriated for it until 1911 when the state allocated $25,000.
The city of Valdosta raised $50,000, and Col. West gave the property that is now the main part of campus to the state for use by the new institution.
His energy and enthusiasm shaped the development of the college for its first 22 years, and his travels in the American southwest led him to choose the Spanish Mission style of architecture for the institution's buildings, a style that has been maintained throughout the years.</p>
<p>The school opened as South Georgia State Normal College (SGSNC) in January 1913, with three college freshmen and 15 sub freshmen.
The early students were required to wear a school uniform and paid $10 per year for tuition and $12 per month for food and board; (of course, each student supplied her own silver knife, fork and spoon.)
Most came to be teachers and studied subjects from literature to physics to agriculture.
In 1922, the school became a four-year college and the legislature changed the name to Georgia State Women's College.</p>
<p>The early years of GSWC saw the continuation and strengthening of some SGSNC traditions.
A May Day festival became an annual event, featuring elaborate skits, dances, and sports exhibitions.
May Queen and her court paraded in procession across the school grounds before a large campus and community audience.</p>
<p>President Powell, head of the college for 22 years, was made dean of the Coordinate College in Athens.
However, his tenure at GSWC lasted less than a year before he had to go on sick leave.
He died a year later in 1935.</p>
During his tenure, New Deal programs enabled the school to expand physically from three to seven buildings.
The Powell Library, dedicated by Eleanor Roosevelt, was a centerpiece of this construction.
During World War II, GSWC emphasized politics and science in its curriculum and in 1943, the B.S. degree was added.
Reade served until 1948, when failing health forced him to retire and Dr. Ralph Thaxton took the helm of GSWC.
He came from University of Georgia, where he had served as professor, Dean, Director of Admissions, and Registrar.
Soon after Dr. Thaxton began his service, the Board of Regents, acting on the advice of a committee which had examined the whole University of Georgia System, declared that in 1950 GSWC was to become a co-educational - Valdosta State College.</p>
<p>Programs in premedical, predentistry, and prepharmacy were added, and the sciences became more prominent.
Greek organizations were formed, with fraternities leading the way, and inter&#x00ad;collegiate athletics became a part of campus life when the Rebels, an all-male basketball team, was formed.</p>
<p>In 1953 VSC acquired the property of the former Emory Jr. College, a private all male school that operated from 1928 to 1953, less than a mile away, and the facilities became the north campus which now house the College of Business and Air Force ROTC.</p>
Thaxton retired for health reasons in 1966, and Dr. S. Walter Martin, former president of Emory University and Vice Chancellor of the University System of Georgia, assumed the presidency.
He presided over a time of physical expansion of the school, including the construction of such buildings as the Odum Library, the Education Center, The Fine Arts Building, the College Union, a Science Administration Building and six dormitories.
The student body grew, the School of Nursing was established, and many programs expanded, including those in graduate education.</p>
Under Dr. Bailey, the school had doubled in size from 4,500 to 9,000 students.
From 1978 to 1993, numerous programs were added and existing courses upgraded, resulting in the early 1980s in and endeavor to make VSC a university.
Throughout the 1980s the college established off-campus sites and course offerings and began receiving state and federal grant funds to develop curriculum and programs.
Valdosta State College became Valdosta State University, the second regional university in the University System of Georgia.
In fall 1998, Valdosta State University adopted the semester system, along with other units of the University System of Georgia.</p>
<p>Under Bailey's leadership VSU continued to grow with the addition of the  University Center in the 90's and a new science building in 2001, later named in honor of President Bailey for his dedication to the University.</p>

<p> In May 2007, T. Hayden Barnes, a student at Valdosta State University (VSU) was &quot;administratively withdrawn&quot; for criticizing the construction of two new parking garages on campus in a manner that University President Ronald Zaccari, over the objection of other administrators, deemed to be indicative of Barnes posing a clear and present danger to the VSU campus.</p>
Captions for the online photos of the proposed parking garages included the words &quot;Ronald Zaccari Memorial Parking Garage&quot; and while Barnes maintains he meant to suggest that students would remember President Zaccari&#x2019;s tenure by the garages, President Zaccari felt otherwise.
Over the advice of other administrators, including University Police Chief of Police, President Zaccari &quot;administratively withdrew&quot; Barnes without a hearing.
Barnes received notice that he was a &#x201c;clear and present danger to the campus&quot; in a letter slipped underneath his dorm room door.</p>
<p>In January 2008, T. Hayden Barnes filed a civil rights lawsuit for violation of his First Amendment and due process rights against the university, VSU President Ronald Zaccari, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, and other VSU administrators.
The suit was filed in the <a>United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> by First Amendment attorney <a>Robert Corn-Revere</a> in cooperation with the <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE).</p>
<p>It was announced in the September 8, 2010 edition of the Valdosta Daily Times that Hayden Barnes won his legal battle against past university president Dr. Ronald Zaccari.
The case is presently on appeal before the <a>United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE) added Valdosta State University (VSU) to its &quot;Red Alert&quot; list of institutions that act with severe and ongoing disregard for the fundamental rights of its students or faculty members.
VSU was joined by two other schools, <a>Tufts University</a> and <a>Johns Hopkins University</a>, on FIRE's &quot;Red Alert&quot; list.
FIRE took VSU off of their &quot;Red Alert&quot; list after new Valdosta State President Patrick Schloss implemented new rules in September 2008 allowing a drastic increase in free speech expression.</p>
<p>The Barnes controversy was the subject of a short documentary produced by FIRE  and has garnered attention in the <a>Valdosta Daily Times</a>, <a>Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, <a>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, <a>WALB</a>, <a>WCTV</a>, and <a>The Huffington Post</a>.</p>
