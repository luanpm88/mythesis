<h2>History</h2>
With this decision, universities began to engage in the processes of achieving this goal through both collaboration to improve post-secondary school education and constructive competition in line with the same goals.
With the decision of Administrative Council in July 1994, the Sabanc&#x0131; Group decided to establish a university and assigned this task to Hac&#x0131; &#x00d6;mer Foundation (VAKSA).
However, the intention was to set up a university that would represent a model in higher education in the world, that is, to create a &quot;world university.&quot;</p>
<p>The foundation of Sabanc&#x0131; University became legal on June 5, 1996 once the Law 4142 passed through Parliament.
On July 31, 1997 the establishment of the campus and creation of the Board of Trustees and the President were announced to the public.
Around the same time, the architectural design of the university began.
In order to have a better understanding of the user needs, a group of academicians and administrators started work with experts from Cannon, the architectural firm responsible for the project.
The ground breaking of the campus construction took place at the end of July 1997 together with the announcement of the Board of Trustees and the President.</p>
<p>The Search Conference, organized in Istanbul on August 18&#x2013;20, 1995 was an important milestone in the founding of the university.
The theme of the conference was &quot;What is the ideal university of the 21st Century?
What should be its key philosophical premises of education?&quot;
Topics were discussed in free association, with no restrictions superimposed.
The aim was to create a definition of the &quot;ideal university&quot; free of prejudices, without a set menu of ready made standards or educational practices which do not reflect the demands of the modern world.
Nor were the conference participants eager to construct imitative models of the research, development, and administrative systems of other successful world universities.
<p>More than fifty scholars, researchers, intellectuals, students, and businessmen from twenty two countries participated in the conference.
At the end of the conference, based on the knowledge and experience of the participants, the key philosophy was set: &quot;creating and developing together.&quot;
The different features of a number of universities overseas and in Turkey were examined, discussed, and studied in order to create finally a synthesis, a world university.</p>
<p>After the search conference, preparations for the university intensified.
A response to the question &quot;How would Sabanc&#x0131; University's philosophy be reflected in the implementation of its faculties and programs?&quot;
was posed to a core committee of 30 members composed of businessmen and academicians.
<p>To offer a direction to these committees, a study entitled &quot;Student Expectation Survey&quot; was conducted in April 1996 to find out what type of university was desired by the students and their families, as well as the instructor at the center for university exam preparation.
A second research project serving the same goal was carried out three years later, when the university opened.
As a result of this, the tendencies of the target audience were updated and confirmed.
<p>Another major conference commemorating Prof. Dr. <a>Fred Emery</a>, who had created the Search Conference, was organized to provide a perspective during the design period.
The goal of this conference, which more than 40 scholars from 14 countries attended, was to discuss the educational problems in the context of globalization and developments in the field of education.
This conference enabled a chance to share the ideas on the design of the university with the participants and get their feedback.
All the activities were published in Educational Futures (Sabanc&#x0131; University Publications, August 2000).
<p>To design and plan the stages of university administration, assistance from worldwide known professional institutions in higher education was requested in July 1997.
After close examination of all offers, in October 1997, the University Administration Project started with the consultancy firm of <a>Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>.
At the first stage, the vision, the mission and the design of the university were completed, and the foundation of administrative infrastructure and selection of technology systems were materialized.
The second stage, which began in September 1998, consisted of putting the design into practice.
Following the design of the academic programs, course design and syllabi, and administration system, Sabanc&#x0131; University moved to the campus in September 1999 to start its first academic year with an opening ceremony on October 20, 1999.</p>
<p>Research, education and training will be based on learning to learn, interdisciplinary study, teamwork, fundamentals, creativity and ideal seeking.
<p>The University will direct its research efforts primarily towards applied and strategic research with the objectives of advancing knowledge, supporting teaching and contributing to the progress of the community.</p>
<p>The University will cultivate its existing local and regional comparative advantages to generate, articulate, uncover and develop leading-edge knowledge in order to create competitive competencies within an international and global context.
<h3>Statement of Academic Freedom</h3>
<p>Sabanc&#x0131; University started working on a position statement on Academic Freedom in May 2002.
During the initial stage of preparation of the position statement, over 30 web sites of various universities and university associations were visited, and the varying approaches of these institutions were compiled.
These texts were subjected to a meticulous screening process; as a result of which a 32-page file was composed and presented to the Deans.
A committee of one academician from each faculty then worked on these texts, and the attached policy statement took shape.
This text was presented to and approved by the Board of Trustees on December 23, 2002.</p>
<p>The University is, by tradition and definition, an autonomous center of learning and research devoted to examining, producing, disseminating and transmitting knowledge for the public good.
The University's obligation to society and to the world community is to ensure scientific integrity and scholarly quality of education.
To fulfill this obligation, its research and teaching must be &quot;morally and intellectually independent of all political authority and economic power,&quot; as was expressly set forth in the &quot;Magna Charta Universitatum&quot; signed by the Rectors of 29 European Universities in Bologna in 1988.</p>
<p>With these universal principles in mind, the Board of Trustees, faculty and administration of Sabanc&#x0131; University jointly take responsibility for assuring fullest protection of freedom of inquiry, thought, and expression.
Sabanc&#x0131; University's commitment to academic freedom finds expression as follows:</p>
<li>All members of the University community involved in the practice of dissemination of knowledge are entitled to freedom in the conduct of their teaching in the classroom, of their research on or off campus, and in the publication, discussion and interpretation of research results.
<li>The University respects the expression of opinion and choice of association of members of the University community in their private, civic capacity.
<p>The right to academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in:</p>
<li>Commitment to ethical obligations and responsibilities to the University community and to one's profession.
<li>Commitment to excellence, innovation, and to advancing the frontiers of knowledge in teaching and research at an individual level and in a collaborative spirit.
<li>Making a clear distinction between one's responsibility to the University and one's rights as an individual, and making sure that the expression of views does not implicate or commit the University in any way.</li>
Hence, this organizational model allows different faculties to interact and collaborate in contrast to the traditional structures composed of discrete institutional units.</p>
<p>The University aspires to develop students who are competent and confident individuals, infused with a strong sense of responsibility for social change and through participatory teamwork, contribute to the development of science and technology created for the benefit of the community.
Sabanc&#x0131; University has four faculties, listed below: &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: <a>right|200px|thumb|Sabanc&#x0131; University's main library, also known as the Information Center or IC.</a> --&gt;</p>
<li>The <a>Faculty of Management</a></li>
<li><a>School of Languages</a></li>
<p>The interdisciplinary design of the academic programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences (FENS) and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS) prepares students for the diverse challenges of modernity and technology.
All students experience a two-tier common program that exposes them to a broad variety of disciplines and approaches.
The University Courses in the first tier assist students in acquiring interdisciplinary thinking skills and a holistic knowledge base as well as discipline-specific content.
Second tier Faculty Courses familiarize students with the undergraduate programs to assist them in their choice of field at the end of the second year.
Students declare majors in their field of interest and choice after the experience of a two-year-based curriculum.
The students, placed into the Faculties according to their University Entrance Exam results, have the opportunity to formally declare their majors after the two-year common program.
Prior to the core curriculum, students not yet at proficiency level enroll in the one-year School of Languages (SL) since English is the medium of instruction at Sabanc&#x0131; University.
<p>Sabanc&#x0131; University freshmen are enrolled in a core curriculum that consists of Elementary Calculus, Social and Political Science, Modern Turkish History, Natural Sciences, English and Turkish.

<p>The 1,353,000 m&#x00b2; (330 acres) campus basically consists of 3 parts, the faculties, the dormitories and the facilities.
The running track periphering the lake is perhaps the most beautiful part of the campus, especially at night, along with ducks bathing in the lake.</p>
Finished in 2004, SGM since hosted both nationally and internationally famed orchestras, bands and other performances.
<p> Sak&#x0131;p Sabanc&#x0131; Museum (SSM) is part of Sabanc&#x0131; University, and therefore also functions as an educational institution.

<p>Hac&#x0131; &#x00d6;mer Sabanc&#x0131; began creating the collection of decorative works of art consisting of figurines, metalwork, porcelain, objets d'art and furniture in the Sabanc&#x0131; Collection in 1940, and this has continually expanded since 1970 thanks to Sak&#x0131;p Sabanc&#x0131;'s dedication and love of art.
The collection includes 18th and 19th century Chinese Famille Noire and Famille Verte porcelain, polychrome vases and decorated plates.
Sabanc&#x0131; University hosts an extremely selective undergraduate population; about 0,01% of the undergraduates rank in the top 1000 of students who take the annual Turkish University Entrance Examination, and 2,5% rank in the top 3000.
