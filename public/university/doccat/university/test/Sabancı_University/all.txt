established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>Turkish higher education reached a turning point when private foundations obtained the right to establish and develop universities.
established$$$@@@%%%With this decision, universities began to engage in the processes of achieving this goal through both collaboration to improve post-secondary school education and constructive competition in line with the same goals.
established$$$@@@%%%With the decision of Administrative Council in July 1994, the Sabanc&#x0131; Group decided to establish a university and assigned this task to Hac&#x0131; &#x00d6;mer Foundation (VAKSA).
established$$$@@@%%%However, the intention was to set up a university that would represent a model in higher education in the world, that is, to create a &quot;world university.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The foundation of Sabanc&#x0131; University became legal on June 5, 1996 once the Law 4142 passed through Parliament.
established$$$@@@%%%On July 31, 1997 the establishment of the campus and creation of the Board of Trustees and the President were announced to the public.
established$$$@@@%%%Around the same time, the architectural design of the university began.
established$$$@@@%%%In order to have a better understanding of the user needs, a group of academicians and administrators started work with experts from Cannon, the architectural firm responsible for the project.
established$$$@@@%%%The ground breaking of the campus construction took place at the end of July 1997 together with the announcement of the Board of Trustees and the President.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Search Conference, organized in Istanbul on August 18&#x2013;20, 1995 was an important milestone in the founding of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%The theme of the conference was &quot;What is the ideal university of the 21st Century?
established$$$@@@%%%What should be its key philosophical premises of education?&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Topics were discussed in free association, with no restrictions superimposed.
established$$$@@@%%%The aim was to create a definition of the &quot;ideal university&quot; free of prejudices, without a set menu of ready made standards or educational practices which do not reflect the demands of the modern world.
established$$$@@@%%%Nor were the conference participants eager to construct imitative models of the research, development, and administrative systems of other successful world universities.
country$$$@@@%%%<a>right|200px|thumb|A view from the stairs of the main dining hall</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>More than fifty scholars, researchers, intellectuals, students, and businessmen from twenty two countries participated in the conference.
established$$$@@@%%%At the end of the conference, based on the knowledge and experience of the participants, the key philosophy was set: &quot;creating and developing together.&quot;
type$$$@@@%%%During the process of searching for excellence, neither international nor national universities were taken as models.
established$$$@@@%%%The different features of a number of universities overseas and in Turkey were examined, discussed, and studied in order to create finally a synthesis, a world university.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After the search conference, preparations for the university intensified.
established$$$@@@%%%A response to the question &quot;How would Sabanc&#x0131; University's philosophy be reflected in the implementation of its faculties and programs?&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%was posed to a core committee of 30 members composed of businessmen and academicians.
image_size$$$@@@%%%In the second stage of the design period, thirteen committees from various fields working on programs and courses within an interdisciplinary framework were formed.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%&quot;Faculty Design Committees&quot;, &quot;Course Study Committees&quot; and &quot;Course Design Committees&quot; are a few examples..</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>To offer a direction to these committees, a study entitled &quot;Student Expectation Survey&quot; was conducted in April 1996 to find out what type of university was desired by the students and their families, as well as the instructor at the center for university exam preparation.
established$$$@@@%%%A second research project serving the same goal was carried out three years later, when the university opened.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result of this, the tendencies of the target audience were updated and confirmed.
faculty$$$@@@%%%The academic program design activities continued until mid 1999s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Another major conference commemorating Prof. Dr. <a>Fred Emery</a>, who had created the Search Conference, was organized to provide a perspective during the design period.
established$$$@@@%%%The goal of this conference, which more than 40 scholars from 14 countries attended, was to discuss the educational problems in the context of globalization and developments in the field of education.
established$$$@@@%%%This conference enabled a chance to share the ideas on the design of the university with the participants and get their feedback.
established$$$@@@%%%All the activities were published in Educational Futures (Sabanc&#x0131; University Publications, August 2000).
nickname$$$@@@%%%&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>right|200px|thumb|The observation tower</a> --&gt;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>To design and plan the stages of university administration, assistance from worldwide known professional institutions in higher education was requested in July 1997.
established$$$@@@%%%After close examination of all offers, in October 1997, the University Administration Project started with the consultancy firm of <a>Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the first stage, the vision, the mission and the design of the university were completed, and the foundation of administrative infrastructure and selection of technology systems were materialized.
established$$$@@@%%%The second stage, which began in September 1998, consisted of putting the design into practice.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the design of the academic programs, course design and syllabi, and administration system, Sabanc&#x0131; University moved to the campus in September 1999 to start its first academic year with an opening ceremony on October 20, 1999.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Statement of Academic Freedom</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sabanc&#x0131; University started working on a position statement on Academic Freedom in May 2002.
established$$$@@@%%%During the initial stage of preparation of the position statement, over 30 web sites of various universities and university associations were visited, and the varying approaches of these institutions were compiled.
established$$$@@@%%%These texts were subjected to a meticulous screening process; as a result of which a 32-page file was composed and presented to the Deans.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Each Dean prepared his/her own Academic Freedom text.
established$$$@@@%%%A committee of one academician from each faculty then worked on these texts, and the attached policy statement took shape.
established$$$@@@%%%This text was presented to and approved by the Board of Trustees on December 23, 2002.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University is, by tradition and definition, an autonomous center of learning and research devoted to examining, producing, disseminating and transmitting knowledge for the public good.
established$$$@@@%%%The University's obligation to society and to the world community is to ensure scientific integrity and scholarly quality of education.
established$$$@@@%%%To fulfill this obligation, its research and teaching must be &quot;morally and intellectually independent of all political authority and economic power,&quot; as was expressly set forth in the &quot;Magna Charta Universitatum&quot; signed by the Rectors of 29 European Universities in Bologna in 1988.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With these universal principles in mind, the Board of Trustees, faculty and administration of Sabanc&#x0131; University jointly take responsibility for assuring fullest protection of freedom of inquiry, thought, and expression.

image_name$$$@@@%%%</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>The University respects the expression of opinion and choice of association of members of the University community in their private, civic capacity.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</li>

image_name$$$@@@%%%</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>Commitment to excellence, innovation, and to advancing the frontiers of knowledge in teaching and research at an individual level and in a collaborative spirit.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academics</h2>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>Undergraduate and graduate programs at Sabanc&#x0131; University differ in their design and approach from those programs of other universities.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The principles that form the foundation of Sabanc&#x0131; University's academic programs and institutional structure are based on an interdisciplinary approach with the absence of traditional departments.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence, this organizational model allows different faculties to interact and collaborate in contrast to the traditional structures composed of discrete institutional units.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University aspires to develop students who are competent and confident individuals, infused with a strong sense of responsibility for social change and through participatory teamwork, contribute to the development of science and technology created for the benefit of the community.
