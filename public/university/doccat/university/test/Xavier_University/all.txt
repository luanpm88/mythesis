established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|right|Academic mall and Alter Hall</a> Xavier University offers 81 majors within the colleges of <em>Arts and Sciences</em>, <em>Social Sciences, Health and Education</em>, and the <em>Williams College of Business</em>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%A wide variety of minors and pre-professional programs, such as medicine, dentistry, law, pharmacy and veterinary medicine are also offered.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%All students must complete the core curriculum.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Undergraduate students attending Xavier must complete a significant number of distribution requirements that are more commonly known as the Core Curriculum.
type$$$@@@%%%There are required courses in: <a>Theology</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Fine Arts</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Physical Science</a>, <a>Literature</a>, Foreign Language, and the <a>Social Sciences</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Core Curriculum is a confluence of <a>Jesuit</a> ideals, and <a>Great Books</a> rigors, known as <a>Ratio Studiorum</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%All graduates, upon completion of a Bachelor degree have read <a>The Republic</a>, <a>Discourse on Method</a>, and selections from the <a>Bible</a> among other original texts.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Major requirements</h3>
undergrad$$$@@@%%%<p>All undergraduate students are required to complete the Core Curriculum (see above) and comply with departmental requirements.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours).
nickname$$$@@@%%%Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18&#x2013;21 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare second major within the Williams College of Business).
established$$$@@@%%%Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%120 credit hours must be obtained to graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree, and all students must achieve a 2.0 GPA minimum in their major course of study.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Certain majors; such as <a>Politics Philosophy and the Public</a> (PPP), <a>Honors Bachelor of Arts</a> (HAB), and Philosophy require a written thesis and defense before a selected committee.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Philosophy also requires a written comprehensive exam.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Grading scale</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2005 Xavier switched to the plus/minus grading system, after using the simpler A,B,C,D,F scale since the University's inception.
established$$$@@@%%%However, in addition to the standard letter grades, Xavier offers professors the option to assign various non-traditional grades, such as VF (Vanished Failure) for students who do not attend class regularly.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The university also offers students the option to &quot;Audit&quot; courses; that is, to take the class, but have any passing grade not computed into the student's Grade Point Average.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<p>Xavier has also switched to a &quot;Quality-Point&quot; conversion scale to compute Grade Point Averages.
image_size$$$@@@%%%The Quality Points are assigned such that each 1/3 of a grade is the equivalent to 1/3 Quality Point per credit hour.
nickname$$$@@@%%%For example, a grade of B would rate 3 Quality Points per credit hour (thus, for a 3-hr course, the student would gain 9 Quality points), while a score of B+ would rate 3 and 1/3 Quality Points per credit hour (so that same 3-hr class would yield 10 Quality Points).
established$$$@@@%%%The total number of Quality Points earned is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted (excepting those officially Withdrawn from consideration &#x2013; where a grade of W was assigned) to compute the student's Grade Point Average.</p>
