<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xavier University was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the <a>Northwest Territory</a>, is the fourth oldest Jesuit University and sixth oldest Catholic university in the United States.
The school was founded in 1831 as a men's college in downtown <a>Cincinnati</a>, adjacent to <a>St.
The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint <a>Francis Xavier</a> by Bishop <a>Edward Fenwick</a>.
Upon Bishop <a>John Baptist Purcell</a>'s request, the <a>Society of Jesus</a> took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Spanish Catholic.
St. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current <a>North Avondale</a> location, about  north of downtown, after the purchase of  from the Avondale Athletic Club.
Xavier High School</a> officially split in 1919, though did not become financially independent until 1934.
The name of the school was changed a second time to its current name, Xavier University, in 1930.</p>
<p>The Williams College of Business was established in 1961 and Xavier's first Doctoral Program in Psychology was initiated in 1997.
Xavier fully admitted women in 1969, but women began attending the college in 1914 in the evening, weekend, and summer school divisions.
<a>Edgecliff College</a>, another Catholic college in Cincinnati, merged with Xavier University in 1980 due to financial troubles.</p>
Hoff was the University's 33rd President, 1991-2000.
The campus covers approximately  in the city of <a>Cincinnati</a> (<a>North Avondale</a> and <a>Evanston, OH</a>) and the City of <a>Norwood, OH</a> and features both residential and academic malls, flanked by the older west campus and by the expanding east campus.
Bellarmine Chapel's roof is in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, also known as a <a>saddle roof</a>, that will not collapse, even if the Chapel walls were removed.
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Bellarmine Chapel</a> Six buildings with <a>castle architecture</a> sit elevated overlooking Victory Parkway to the west and resemble a single fortress.
Hinkle Hall, the oldest standing building on campus (1919), sits in the middle of this impressive chain and is a three-story Tudor-Gothic structure whose <a>turret</a>s were modeled after the Xavier Family Castle in <a>Navarre</a>, <a>Spain</a>.
It houses the departments of Math, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology.
Originally Alumni Science Hall (1919), it was renamed after the former <a>Edgecliff College</a> and is home to the Department of Music.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the mall to the east stands the tallest structure on campus, Schott Hall.
It houses the Office of Admission and Office of Financial Aid in addition to the Departments of Modern Languages, Classics, Communication Arts, Political Science/Sociology, Accountancy, Finance, and Management and Entrepreneurship.
<p>To the north of the Academic Mall and on the opposite side of the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel is the Residential Mall.
Buenger accommodates over 200 freshmen and sophomore athletes and honors students in suites.
<p>On the opposite side of Victory Parkway from the Academic and Residential malls is west campus.
Cintas is surrounded on all sides by several parking lots and, on the far east side, is the A. B. Cohen Center.
Cohen is the home to the Art Department and Xavier Art Gallery, as well as the School of Nursing and departments of Criminal Justice, Social Work, <a>Occupational Therapy</a>, Health Services Administration, and some of the offices of the School of Education.
South of Cohen is the McGrath Health and Counseling Center which marks the furthest east building on campus at Cleneay Avenue.
South of Cintas is Flynn Hall which houses the Xavier Post Office and Campus Police.
Across from Flynn Hall is The Commons, which is an upper-class apartment building.
<p>Xavier's Campus Police Department is composed of 22 sworn personnel.
Each police officer at Xavier is state-certified as a police officer and has full arrest powers in the state of Ohio.

<a>thumb|right|Academic mall and Alter Hall</a> Xavier University offers 81 majors within the colleges of <em>Arts and Sciences</em>, <em>Social Sciences, Health and Education</em>, and the <em>Williams College of Business</em>.
The Core Curriculum is a confluence of <a>Jesuit</a> ideals, and <a>Great Books</a> rigors, known as <a>Ratio Studiorum</a>.
All graduates, upon completion of a Bachelor degree have read <a>The Republic</a>, <a>Discourse on Method</a>, and selections from the <a>Bible</a> among other original texts.</p>
Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College.
<p>In 2005 Xavier switched to the plus/minus grading system, after using the simpler A,B,C,D,F scale since the University's inception.
However, in addition to the standard letter grades, Xavier offers professors the option to assign various non-traditional grades, such as VF (Vanished Failure) for students who do not attend class regularly.
The total number of Quality Points earned is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted (excepting those officially Withdrawn from consideration &#x2013; where a grade of W was assigned) to compute the student's Grade Point Average.</p>
<li>Xavier has been recognized as one of the top ten &quot;Master's Universities&quot; in the <a>Midwest</a> for the last 14 years by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.
<li>It has been named one of the best 366 colleges in the United States by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>.</li>
is the third highest graduation rate for athletes in the nation behind <a>Duke University</a> and <a>Stanford University</a>.
Xavier sports teams have several traditional rivalries with local universities, including the <a>University of Cincinnati</a> and the <a>University of Dayton</a>.</p>
The team has enjoyed considerable recent success, reaching the <a>Elite Eight</a> in the <a>NCAA tournament</a> in <a>2004</a> and <a>2008</a>.
Since 1985, every men's basketball player who has played as a senior has graduated with a degree.
