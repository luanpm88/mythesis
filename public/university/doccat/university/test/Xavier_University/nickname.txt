The chapel is the home to the Bellarmine Catholic Parish in Cincinnati.</p>

St. Barbara Hall and the Armory are home to Xavier's ROTC.
<p>Undergraduate students attending Xavier must complete a significant number of distribution requirements that are more commonly known as the Core Curriculum.
Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours).
Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18&#x2013;21 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare second major within the Williams College of Business).
For example, a grade of B would rate 3 Quality Points per credit hour (thus, for a 3-hr course, the student would gain 9 Quality points), while a score of B+ would rate 3 and 1/3 Quality Points per credit hour (so that same 3-hr class would yield 10 Quality Points).
<p>The Xavier University Student Government Association is the recognized governing body of student body.</p>
<p> The Xavier men's basketball team is perhaps the best known of the sports sponsored at Xavier.
The absence of the team led to the creation of the popular t-shirt &quot;Xavier Football: Undefeated since 1973.&quot;</p>
When both teams play the same night, Xavier games are aired on WKRC.
