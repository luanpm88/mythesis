<p>In recent years, a number of building projects have been completed on campus including the <a>Cintas Center</a> and the <a>Gallagher Student Center</a>.
Adjacent to the Gallagher Student Center (north to south) is Science Row: Lindner Hall (Physics), Logan Hall (Chemistry) and Albers Hall (Biology).
Schmidt Hall sits next as the University&#x2019;s current Administration Building, followed by Edgecliff Hall.
Next (south to north) is McDonald Library followed by Alter Hall.
Diagonally north across the mall is Buenger Hall.
Diagonally south across the mall from Brockman and due east of Gallagher are Kuhlman Hall and Husman Hall.
The Quality Points are assigned such that each 1/3 of a grade is the equivalent to 1/3 Quality Point per credit hour.
