It has Campuses in <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Melbourne</a>, and <a>Warrnambool</a>, <a>Victoria</a>.
The University is named after leader of the Australian federation movement and second <a>Prime Minister</a>, <a>Alfred Deakin</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deakin University was originally opened by Marc Deakin and is a commissioned Victorian university.
Its establishment was the result of the commissioning of the <em>Ramsay Committee</em>, which was created by the State Government of <a>Victoria</a> and the Federal Government of Australia in September 1970, to establish Victoria's fourth university in regional Victoria.
Three locations at <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Ballarat</a> and <a>Bendigo</a> were considered.</p>
<p>In its report on 14 December 1973, the Federal Government's Australian Universities Commission recommended that a university be established at Geelong.
This led to the declaration of Deakin University as a university in 1974, by an Act of Parliament referred to as the <a>DEAKIN UNIVERSITY ACT 1974.
<p>The University was officially opened in 1977 by the then Premier of Victoria Sir <a>Rupert Hamer</a> at the original Campus at Waurn Ponds, Geelong.</p>
<p>The three other commissioned Victorian universities include: <a>The University of Melbourne</a> (1853), <a>Monash University</a> (1958), and <a>LaTrobe University</a> (1964).</p>
<p>Upon establishment, Deakin took over the Waurn Ponds campus of the Gordon Institute of Technology (now the <a>Gordon Institute of TAFE</a>), and the institute's higher education courses.
It also absorbed <em>State College of Victoria, Geelong</em> (a teacher's college).
Deakin enrolled its first students at its Geelong Campus at Waurn Ponds in 1977.</p>
<p>Deakin remained a single Campus university for approximately 15 years until the Federal Government's <a>Dawkins Revolution</a> of higher education in the late 1980s came into effect.
As a result, Deakin became a larger university by merging with the <a>Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education</a> in August 1990 and most of <a>Victoria College</a> in December 1991.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, debate ensued in Geelong about the fate of the city's historic waterfront woolstores, known as the Dalgety's Woolstores, which were dilapidated amidst an area undergoing major development.
Some buildings were demolished despite a community outcry, and the fate of the remaining buildings was unclear until Deakin University acquired the site for a sixth Campus.
Major renovations took place over several years, and in 1997, the Woolstores Campus (now the Geelong Waterfront Campus) opened.</p>
<p>The result of the amalgamations and developments created a large multi-campus University spanning 300 kilometres covering six Campuses: three in <a>Melbourne</a> in the suburbs of  <a>Burwood</a>, <a>Clayton</a> (<em>Rusden Campus</em>), and <a>Malvern</a> (<em>Toorak Campus</em>); two in <a>Geelong</a> at <a>Waurn Ponds</a> and Geelong Waterfront; and one at <a>Warrnambool</a>).</p>
<p>In 1993, the University established Victoria's third <a>law school</a>.
Its establishment was unique, in that it was the first, and only, law school in Victoria to offer distance learning law degrees as well as traditional on-campus law degrees.
The School's range of courses include <a>Bachelor of Laws</a>, <a>Master of Laws</a> and <a>PhD</a>.
Two law school chapters were established, one each at the Burwood and Geelong Campuses respectively.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the University decided to close the Rusden Campus, which held mainly the Faculties of Environmental Science and Teaching.
The Campus was progressively closed between 2001 and 2003, with students and courses relocated to the Burwood Campus.
<p>On 8 April 2006 the then Prime Minister Mr <a>John Howard</a> announced that a new Medical School would be established at Deakin University.
In his speech delivered at the Victorian Liberal Party State Council in Melbourne on 8 April 2006 he said: 'I am particularly pleased to announce the Medical School at Deakin University which will ensure the development of a strong rural and regional medical workforce throughout western Victorian region.'  </p>
<p>In 2007, the Toorak Campus in Malvern was closed and sold.
Its resources and courses were relocated to new facilities at the Burwood Campus.
<p>On 1 May 2008, Victoria's third Medical School was officially opened by the then Prime Minister of Australia Mr <a>Kevin Rudd</a> and the Victorian Premier Mr <a>John Brumby</a>.
There are now three Medical Schools in Victoria with the first being established at The <a>University of Melbourne</a> in 1862, and subsequently <a>Monash University</a> in 1958.</p>
It reflects Deakin's mission as an innovative and progressive university.</p>

The Geelong Waterfront Campus  is Deakin's newest Campus, located on <a>Corio Bay</a>, in the central business district of <a>Geelong</a>.
Originally built as woolstores in 1893, the buildings have been extensively renovated to create a modern and impressive Campus centre, whilst retaining most of the original internal elements.
<p>More than 2100 students are based at the Geelong Waterfront Campus which hosts the School of Architecture and Building, the School of Health and Social Development and the School of Nursing.</p>
<p>Services and facilities include a 320-seat lecture theatre, cafe, Library, bookshop, 24 hour computer laboratories, 24 hour on site security, medical centre and counselling services, multi-faith prayer rooms, Computer Aided Design (CAD) laboratories, purpose built occupational therapy laboratory and design studios.</p>
<p>A $37 million redevelopment of the Dennys Lascelles Building has increased the capacity of this Campus, allowing the University to provide an expanded range of courses.
<p>The original Campus of Deakin University  is located in the regional city of <a>Geelong</a> in the suburb of <a>Waurn Ponds</a>, 72 kilometres south west of Melbourne.
<p>The Campus is serviced by the Princes Highway and the Geelong Ring Road, is approximately 5 kilometres from the Geelong Central Business District and is in close proximity to <a>Bells Beach</a> and the <a>Great Ocean Road</a>.
<p>The Campus is home to the Geelong Technology Precinct, which provides research and development capabilities and opportunities for university&#x2013;industry partnerships and new enterprises in the region.</p>
<p>On-campus accommodation is provided for 447 students in 40 units.
<p>The largest Campus of the University is in Melbourne's eastern suburb of <a>Burwood</a>  on Burwood <a>Highway</a>, about 45 minutes by tram (<a>route 75</a>) from the Melbourne city centre.
<p>The Melbourne Campus at Burwood is noted for its excellent learning facilities and its innovative architecture.
<p>The redevelopment of the Campus has included the creation of two state-of-the-art buildings on the Elgar Road side of the Campus in which the business activities of the Faculty of Business and Law and the international activities of the University are located.</p>
<p>Features of the Melbourne Campus at Burwood include the Deakin University Art Gallery, Motion.Lab - motion capture facility, a purpose built gymnasium and sports hall, cafes, food outlets and a bar, the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Test Centre, bookshop, a refurbished Library, 24 hour computer laboratories, 24 hour on-site security, medical centre and counselling services and multi-faith prayer rooms.</p>

<p>The Warrnambool Campus  is situated on the banks of the Hopkins River in the coastal city of <a>Warrnambool</a>, close to local surf beaches and popular tourist attractions.
The 94 hectare site is approximately five kilometres from the Warrnambool CBD, serviced by the <a>Princes Highway</a>.
<p>Located in a small, regional city with an on-campus student population of more than 1000, the Warrnambool Campus is a friendly, close-knit community, with a personal and informal relationship between students and staff.</p>
<p>On-campus facilities include a comprehensive Library, excellent teaching and learning spaces, purpose built for niche courses such as the freshwater biology and marine biology courses, fitness club, basketball, netball and tennis courts and a golf course, medical centre and counselling services, 24 hour computer laboratories, 24 hour on-site security, cafe, bookshop and multi-faith prayer rooms.</p>
<p>Its proximity to a range of aquatic environments provides an ideal location for specialist studies in marine biology and freshwater biology &#x2013; making it a &#x2018;classroom without walls&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Other areas of study offered at the Warrnambool Campus include arts, business, education, environment, health sciences, law, management, nursing and psychology.</p>
<p>The Campus is well serviced by daily rail and bus services from Melbourne and Geelong, as well as a bus which runs between the Warrnambool city centre and the Campus.</p>
<p>The Warrnambool Campus has 25 units with between four and 21 bedrooms per unit, providing on-campus accommodation for 240 students in a mixed gender and multicultural environment.</p>

<p>Deakin University now offers the <a>Associate Degree of Arts, Business and Sciences</a>, also known as the Deakin at Your Doorstep program, which is a two-year, full-time (or part-time equivalent) course, available at the Warrnambool Campus, as well as partner TAFEs across Victoria.
Successful completion of the associate degree provides a pathway into a range of targeted Deakin bachelors degrees, for which you may gain up to 18 months credit in your chosen degree.</p>
