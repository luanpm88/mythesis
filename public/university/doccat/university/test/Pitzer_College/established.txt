<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pitzer was founded in 1963 as a <a>women's college</a> by <a>Russell K. Pitzer</a> (1878&#x2013;1978), a California citrus magnate, philanthropist, and <a>Pomona College</a> alumnus.
In April 1963, poet and visionary <a>John W. Atherton</a> was hired as Pitzer's first president, and over the next seventeen months he recruited students, faculty, and trustees and constructed Scott and Sanborn Halls just in time for the fall 1964 semester.
During the College's first year, students and faculty created the curriculum and the school's system of governance.
The College graduated its first class of students in 1964 and became co-educational in the fall of 1970.

Three of the residence halls (Pitzer, Atherton and Sanborn) were built in 2007 and are <a>Gold LEED-Certified</a>.
In December 2010, the College will break ground on three new LEED-Certified residence halls on the northeast side of its campus, scheduled to be completed by fall 2012.</p>
<p>The Pitzer College campus occupies the northeast corner of the Claremont Colleges' property.</p>
<p>Currently, <a>Foothill Boulevard</a>/<a>Historic Route 66</a> and Harvey Mudd College border the campus to the north, Claremont Boulevard to the east, Ninth Street to the south, and North Mills Avenue to the west.

Harvey Mudd College is adjacent to Pitzer&#x2019;s north, Scripps to the west, and Claremont McKenna to the south.</p>
<p><a>Contemporary architecture</a> characterizes the majority of Pitzer's buildings, several of which were designed by <a>Gwathmey-Siegel</a> following major donations from <a>Eli Broad</a>, a board member emeritus and former <a>chair</a> of the Pitzer College Board of <a>Trustee</a>s.
A notable exception is the Grove House, a <a>California Bungalow</a> built in 1902 for a local citrus grower during the height of the <a>Arts and Crafts movement</a>.
The building, a popular campus hangout, was purchased for $1.00 and moved to Pitzer in 1977 under the direction of Professor <a>emeritus</a> <a>Barry Sanders</a>.
The <a>John R. Rodman Arboretum</a> is part of the campus, and most <a>landscaping</a> follows principles of <a>xeriscaping</a>.
