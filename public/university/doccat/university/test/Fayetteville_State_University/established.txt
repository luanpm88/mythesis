<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1867, seven <a>African-American</a> men - Matthew N. Leary, Andrew J. Chesnutt, Robert Simmons, George Grainger, Thomas Lomax, Nelson Carter, and David A. Bryant - paid $136 for two lots on Gillespie Street and converted themselves into a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees to maintain this property permanently as a site for the education of black children in <a>Fayetteville</a>. </p>
<p><a>General O. Howard</a> of the Freedman's Bureau, one of the best-known friends of black education, erected a building on this site, and the institution became known as the <strong>Howard School</strong>.
By a legislative act of 1877, the <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> provided for the establishment of a <a>Normal School</a> for the education of black teachers.
The Howard School was chosen as the most promising because of its successful record during the previous ten years.
It was designated a teacher training institution, and its name was changed to the State Colored Normal School.</p>
<p>In 1939, under Dr. J. Ward Seabrook the school became Fayetteville State Teachers College, thereafter being authorized to grant the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree in Education.
The college received both state and regional <a>accreditation</a> in 1947.
During Dr. Jones&#x2019; administration, the curriculum was expanded to include majors in secondary education and programs leading to degrees outside the teaching field.
The name of the school was changed to Fayetteville State College in 1963.
<p>In 1969, the institution acquired its present name, Fayetteville State University, and Dr. Charles A. Lyons, graduate of <a>Shaw University</a>, Jr. was elected president.
By a legislative act in 1972, Fayetteville State University became a constituent institution of <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.
The <a>Chief Executive Officer</a>'s position was re-titled to <a>Chancellor</a>, with Dr. Lyons becoming the first Chancellor of the university.
During his tenure, the curriculum was expanded to include a variety of both baccalaureate and master&#x2019;s level programs.
In addition, the <a>Fort Bragg</a>-<a>Pope AFB Extension Center</a>, in conjunction with the weekend and evening college, was established in order to provide military personnel and other persons employed full-time with the opportunity to further their education.</p>
<p>The general academic structure took its present configuration in 1985 when the University became a Comprehensive Level 1 Institution.
Thelma Jean Bryan made history in July 2003, accepting the job as Chancellor of Fayetteville State University as the first female leader of the institution, moreover the first African-American female chancellor of the University of North Carolina System.
