<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally named Superior Normal School, the university was founded by Wisconsin legislators as a school to train teachers in 1893.
Superior Normal School's first class graduated in 1897.
In 1909 the institution became Wisconsin's first normal school to offer a full-scale training program for the new idea of kindergarten.
It also was the first to offer a four-year program for high school teachers beginning in 1923.
After authorization to grant bachelor's degrees in education in 1926, the school took on the new name of Superior State Teachers College.
Graduate degrees were authorized in 1947 and first offered in 1950.
In 1951 the state board of regents changed the institution's name to Wisconsin State College-Superior to better reflect its expanding role.
Wisconsin's state colleges eventually were reclassified as universities, resulting in another name change in 1964 to Wisconsin State University-Superior.
Finally, in 1971 Superior became part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> and acquired its present name.</p>
