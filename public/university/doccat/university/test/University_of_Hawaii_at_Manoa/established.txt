<p>The <strong>University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa</strong> is a public, co-educational <a>university</a> and is the flagship campus of the greater <a>University of Hawaii system</a>.
The school is located in <a>M&#x0101;noa</a>, an urban neighborhood community of <a>Honolulu CDP</a>, <a>City and County of Honolulu</a>, <a>Hawaii</a>, <a>United States</a>, approximately three miles east and inland from <a>downtown Honolulu</a> and one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from <a>Ala Moana</a> and <a>Waik&#x012b;k&#x012b;</a>.
The campus occupies the eastern half of the mouth of the greater M&#x0101;noa Valley.
It is accredited by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a> and is governed by the <a>Hawaii State Legislature</a> and a semi-autonomous Board of Regents, which in turn hires a president to be administrator.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Hawaii at M&#x0101;noa was founded in 1907 as a <a>land grant college</a> of agriculture and mechanical arts.
In 1912 it was renamed the College of Hawaii and moved to its present location.
William Kwai Fong Yap petitioned the territorial legislature six years later for university status which led to another renaming to the University of Hawai'i in 1920.
<p>In 1931 the Territorial Normal and Training School was absorbed into the university.
It is now the College of Education.</p>
The college of agriculture and mechanical arts is now the <a>College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources</a> (CTAHR), one of the few agricultural colleges in the United States focused on tropical research.
The University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa is also home to two of the most prominent professional schools in the state.
The <a>William S. Richardson School of Law</a> and the <a>John A. Burns School of Medicine</a> are the only law and medical schools in Hawai<img>i, respectively.
The <a>Center for Hawaiian Studies</a> provides 'excellence in the pursuit of knowledge concerning the Native people of Hawai<img>i' [<a>http://www.hawaii.edu/chs/</a>].</p>
<p>With extramural grants and contracts in excess of $300 million in 2002-03, UH-Manoa exploded in terms of research related to Hawaii's physical landscape, its people, and their heritage.
The landscape facilitates advances in marine biology, oceanography, underwater robotic technology, astronomy, geology and geophysics, agriculture, aquaculture and tropical medicine.
Its heritage, the people and its close ties to the Asian and Pacific region create a favorable environment for study and research in the arts, genetics, intercultural relations, linguistics, religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Extramural funding increased from $211 million in FY 2002 to nearly $255 million in FY 2003.
Nonresearch awards totaled $90 million in FY 2003.
Overall, extramural funding has increased by 50% over the past ten years.
<p>Systemwide, the majority of research funding comes from the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce, and the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA).
<p>The new $150-million medical complex in the area of Kaka&#x2018;ako opened in the spring of 2005.
The facility houses a state-of-the-art biomedical research and education center that attracts significant federal funding and private sector investment in biotechnology research and development.
<p>The John A. Burns school of medicine, the Medical School of the University of Hawaii, is ranked 12th in the nation for <a>geriatrics</a>.</p>
<p>Other Highlights: Named a &quot;Best Western College&quot; and a &quot;America's Best Value College&quot; by Princeton Review but was dropped in the 2009 edition.</p>
<p>According to the 2003 report of the Institutional Research Office, a plurality of students at the University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa are <a>Caucasian</a> making up twenty-four percent of the student body.
Smaller populations of Pacific Islanders and other ethnic groups make up the remainder.</p>

<p>University of Hawaii at Manoa has 19 schools and colleges, including the School of Architecture, School of Earth Science and Technology, the College of Arts and Humanities, the <a>Shidler College of Business</a>, the College of Education, and the College of Engineering.
The College of Business Administration was renamed the Shidler College of Business on September 6, 2006, after real estate executive Jay Shidler, an alumnus of the college, donated $25 million to the college.</p>
<p>The Associated Students of the University of Hawai&#x02bb;i (ASUH) is the undergraduate student government representing all full-time, classified, and undergraduate students at the <a>University of Hawai&#x02bb;i at M&#x0101;noa</a>.
ASUH was chartered by the <a>University of Hawai&#x02bb;i</a> Board of Regents in 1912 and is now in its 97th year of serving and representing students.
ASUH strives to serve students by advocating on their behalf with various entities, including the university administration, faculty, staff, community groups and government officials.
<p><a>Ka Leo O Hawaii</a> is the student newspaper at the University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa, founded in 1922 (as The Mirror).
Beginning in the Fall 2007 semester the Ka Leo is now printed in full color.</p>
<li><a>The Newman Center / Catholic Campus Ministry</a> serves the community at the University and surrounding area.</li>
<li>The <a>Lyon Arboretum</a> serves as the only tropical <a>arboretum</a> belonging to any University in the United States.
The Arboretum, located in Manoa Valley, was established in 1918 by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association to demonstrate watershed restoration and test various tree species for reforestation, as well as collect living plants of economic value.
In 1953, it became part of the University of Hawai&#x02bb;i at Manoa.
Its over 15,000 accessions focus primarily on the monocot families of palms, gingers, heliconias, bromeliads, and aroids.</li>
<li>The <a>Waikiki Aquarium</a>, founded in 1904, is the third oldest public aquarium in the United States.
A part of the  University of Hawaii since 1919, the Aquarium is located next to a living reef on the Waikiki shoreline.</li>

The University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a>, the only Hawai<img>i school to do so.
In men's volleyball and women's water polo it competes in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a>, and the men's swimming and diving team have been invited the two last years to compete in the <a>Conference USA</a> Invitational meet.

&lt;!--  Commented out: <a>thumb|left|Hawaii Athletic Logo</a> --&gt; The men's teams were formerly known as the <em>Rainbow Warriors</em> but in 2000, in response to complaints from the football program that the rainbow was a symbol of <a>homosexuality</a>, the University of Hawai<img>i at M&#x0101;noa athletics program allowed each sport to select their own team names.
The men's volleyball team chose the name <em>Men of War</em>, but that name proved to be unpopular and was replaced by the <em>Warriors</em>.
The men's volleyball won an NCAA championship in 2002, but it was later vacated due to violations.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 2001, the President of the <a>University of Hawaii system</a> also served as the M&#x0101;noa campus's chancellor.
In 2001, the position of Chancellor was recreated by then-UH president <a>Evan Dobelle</a> after several years of discussion around the possible conflict of interest that might arise in this dual role (being the president of a University system while concurrently being the chancellor of a specific campus within the system).</p>
