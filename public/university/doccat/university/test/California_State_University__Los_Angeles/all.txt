established$$$@@@%%%<p>The campus is nestled among rolling <a>hills</a> on a site that once housed one of <a>California</a>'s 36 original <a>adobes</a>, built in 1776 by <a>Franciscan</a> missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908.
established$$$@@@%%%These lands once were part of a Spanish land grant known as <a>Rancho Rosa Castilla</a>, given to Juan Batista Batz, a <a>Basque</a> rancher from northern <a>Spain</a> who settled here in the 1850s.
established$$$@@@%%%The inspiration for the name of the rancho, according to local historians, was the wild <a>rose</a>s that once grew near the ranch home.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The main drive through the campus is known as Paseo Rancho Castilla, in acknowledgment of the University's historic heritage.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>CSULA was founded on July 2, 1947 by an act of the California <a>legislature</a> and opened for classes as &quot;The Los Angeles State College&quot; (LASC) on the campus of <a>Los Angeles City College</a> (LACC).

established$$$@@@%%%The open book symbolizes the educational purpose of the University, with the numerals indicating the date of founding.
established$$$@@@%%%The original design for the seal, created by John R. Siebon, was accepted by the Associated Students as their official emblem in November 1949, and was adopted officially by the President of the University and the <a>Executive Council</a> in April 1953.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>University Mace</h3>
