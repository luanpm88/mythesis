<p><strong>Oakland University</strong> is a <a>public university</a> co-founded by <a>Matilda Dodge Wilson</a> and <a>John A. Hannah</a> whose  campus is located in north <a>Oakland County, Michigan</a> in the cities of <a>Rochester Hills</a> and  <a>Auburn Hills</a> <a>Michigan</a>.
It is the only major research university in <a>Oakland County</a>, from which OU derives its name.
The <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> has classified OU as a Doctoral Research-Intensive University.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oakland University was created in 1957 when <a>Matilda Dodge Wilson</a>, widow of automobile magnate <a>John Francis Dodge</a>, and her second husband, Alfred Wilson, donated their  estate to <a>Michigan State University</a>, including <a>Meadow Brook Hall</a>, Sunset Terrace and all the estate's other buildings and collections, along with $2 million.
Main campus buildings were completed near Squirrel Road in Pontiac Township (now the city of Auburn Hills).
Originally known as Michigan State University&#x2013;Oakland, the university enrolled its first students in 1959 and was renamed Oakland University in 1963.
The university has been officially independent since 1970.
Wilson asked <a>U.S. Postmaster General</a> <a>Arthur Summerfield</a> to let the university use a <a>Rochester, Michigan</a> mailing address, even though the main part of the campus was in <a>Pontiac Township</a> (now Auburn Hills).
After reminding Summerfield that she had contributed to his administration, Summerfield granted her request.
The current president of the university is Dr. Gary Russi, who replaced Dr. Sandra Packard on an interim basis in 1995 and was appointed president by the Board of Trustees in 1996.</p>
