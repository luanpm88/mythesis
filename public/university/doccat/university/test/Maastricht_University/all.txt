established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Maastricht University</strong> (officially abbreviated as <strong>UM</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Maastricht</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1976, the university is the second youngest in the Netherlands.
established$$$@@@%%%The university's founding name was <strong>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</strong> and was changed into <strong>Universiteit Maastricht</strong> in 1996.
established$$$@@@%%%Since 2008 the name is Maastricht University, which the university claims will emphasize the international character.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>Maastricht University has over 13,000 students, 39% of whom are foreign students, and over 3,500 employees.
nickname$$$@@@%%%About half of the <a>bachelor</a>'s programmes are fully offered in <a>English</a>, while the other half is taught wholly or partly in <a>Dutch</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%Most of the <a>master</a>'s and <a>PhD</a> programmes are in English.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Maastricht University was officially established in 1976 to become the eighth public medical school in the Netherlands.
established$$$@@@%%%Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the national government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%Political leaders in the province of <a>Limburg</a>, most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the <a>Dutch Labour Party</a> and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This new academic institution, Tans argued, would not only be vital to sustain the city's intellectual life, but could also contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in the southernmost part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing serious economic challenges following the collapse of the <a>regional coal mining industry</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<pre></pre>
campus$$$@@@%%%<p>By the early 1970s, however, the shortage of medical professionals had all but disappeared and political support for a new medical school waned.
established$$$@@@%%%In an unusual decision, the newly established school decided not to await official recognition and to start its educational programme in September of 1974, promising an innovative approach to academic education by adopting a new teaching method known as <a>problem-based learning</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year.
established$$$@@@%%%By the end of 1975, the <a>Dutch Parliament</a> eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.
established$$$@@@%%%The new university, named <em>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</em>, was officially established on January 9th, 1976, when <a>Queen Juliana of the Netherlands</a> signed the university&#x2019;s founding charter at a ceremony in Maastricht.
president$$$@@@%%%Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to expand into other academic fields.
established$$$@@@%%%A Faculty of Law was created in 1981, to be followed by an economics faculty in 1984.
established$$$@@@%%%In the 1990s, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and the Faculty of Psychology were established.
type$$$@@@%%%The university adopted a growth strategy focusing on new academic disciplines, such as knowledge engineering and biomedical studies, and began to develop educational programmes with a distinctly European outlook, such as the European Law School and European Studies.
established$$$@@@%%%At the beginning of the 21st century, the university started to establish schools and colleges, such as <a>University College Maastricht</a> (2002), one of the first liberal arts colleges in the Netherlands, and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (2004).
established$$$@@@%%%Often created as separate entities within the university, these new departments were later integrated in the university&#x2019;s faculty structure.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was renamed <em>Universiteit Maastricht</em> in 1996 and switched to its current English-language name in 2008.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor&#x2019;s programmes, 56 master&#x2019;s programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Campuses</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Maastricht University  has two campuses: the city centre campus, consisting of a number of historic buildings housing the humanities and social sciences faculties, and the modern Randwyck campus in the southeastern part of the city, which has become the university&#x2019;s centre for the medical, health, psychology and life sciences.
students$$$@@@%%%The Randwyck campus includes the university hospital.
established$$$@@@%%%Initial plans in the 1960s and 1970s, in line with infrastructural plans at other public universities in the Netherlands, envisaged a functional, single-campus university to be established in the largely undeveloped Randwyck district.
established$$$@@@%%%These plans never fully materialized, in part because university administrators and staff considered the UM&#x2019;s presence in the historic inner city to be important asset in attracting prospective students.
established$$$@@@%%%Instead, the university developed in a bipolar way with campuses at both sides of the river <a>Meuse</a>.
mascot$$$@@@%%%This bipolarity is symbolized in the university's logo by two triangles pointing to each other.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of <a>Venlo</a>, the Belgian capital of <a>Brussels</a> and the city of <a>Bangalore, India</a>.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<h3>City Centre Campus</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|The courtyard at Nieuwenhof, home of University College Maastricht.</a>The university&#x2019;s humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht&#x2019;s city centre, west of the river Meuse, at what can be described as an 'urban campus&#x2019; in the historic inner city.
students$$$@@@%%%In addition to teaching and research facilities, the university&#x2019;s executive and administrative centre, the visitors&#x2019; centre and the main branch of the university library are situated here.
type$$$@@@%%%Most UM facilities in the city centre are situated in the <em>Jekerkwartier</em> neighbourhood, the southwestern part of the inner city sometimes referred to as Maastricht&#x2019;s university quarter.
established$$$@@@%%%Most of the university&#x2019;s inner city properties have official monumental status.
established$$$@@@%%%As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed significantly to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht&#x2019;s historic city centre.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first building to be obtained by the university is the former <a>Jesuit</a> monastery at the Tongersestraat, where in 1974, the newly established medical school started its first academic year.
type$$$@@@%%%After the medical faculty moved to the newly constructed university hospital, this large building complex, constructed in 1939, became home to the economics faculty, which is the university&#x2019;s largest academic unit in terms of student numbers.
established$$$@@@%%%The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (&#x2018;mensa&#x2019;) and a large lecture hall (&#x2018;collegezaal&#x2019;).
established$$$@@@%%%The Faculty of Law is housed in the former provincial government building (<em>Oud Gouvernement</em>) at the Bouillonstraat (Nos.
established$$$@@@%%%1-3), which was constructed in 1935 and was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new building in the southeastern part of the city.

established$$$@@@%%%The only faculty in the inner city which is not located in the <em>Jekerkwartier</em> neighbourhood is the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%This faculty, founded in 1994, was initially housed at the Hustinx building, but currently occupies two historic, adjacent buildings north of the Vrijthof square: <em>Tilly Court</em>, built in 1714 as the residence for the military governor of Maastricht, and <em>Soiron Canon&#x2019;s House</em> (1786), located at the Grote Gracht.

established$$$@@@%%%The UM acquired the building to become its administrative head office in 1999.
established$$$@@@%%%The Minderbroedersberg and the university&#x2019;s executive organization located here are colloquially referred to as &#x2018;de Berg&#x2019; (the Hill) by university employees for its physical location upon a small hill in the inner city, overlooking several other inner city locations.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The building complex, especially its &#x2018;Aula&#x2019; (main hall), also serves as the university&#x2019;s primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. defenses.
country$$$@@@%%%Down the hill, at the former Bonnefanten Convent, is the university&#x2019;s visitors centre, which also houses the student service centre, administrative offices, the university gift shop and a coffee house.
established$$$@@@%%%This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent until 1798 and was afterwards for military purposes.
established$$$@@@%%%In the twentieth century, the city&#x2019;s main art museum, the <a>Bonnefantenmuseum</a>, was established here.
established$$$@@@%%%It became the main branch of the university library in 1979, until the library moved to its current location at the Grote Looiersstraat.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The library building at the Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and after serving as the city&#x2019;s <a>poor house</a> for a few years, it was transformed into a military hospital which it remained until the 1920s.
established$$$@@@%%%Later, the building housed the city&#x2019;s public library until 1999, when it moved to its new location in the modern Ceramique district.
established$$$@@@%%%The building was then acquired by the UM.
students$$$@@@%%%After major renovation and expansion works, which included a new entrance at the courtyard, the university library relocated here in 2003.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|The Randwyck district in the southeastern part of Maastricht.</a>The
campus$$$@@@%%%Randwyck campus, developed since the 1970s, has become the centre for the university&#x2019;s medical and life sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the sprawling university hospital, which moved from its original location in the western part of Maastricht to its current site in Randwyck in 1992.
established$$$@@@%%%The main university buildings, some of which are physically connected to the hospital, were built in the 1990s.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Most sites have been constructed along the Universiteitssingel, the area&#x2019;s eastern thoroughfare running parallel to the A2 highway.
established$$$@@@%%%The medical faculty, the first to move to the Randwyck district, merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences in 2007 to become the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%The other faculty currently housed at Randwyck is the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience.
students$$$@@@%%%The university library's Randwyck branch is located at Universiteitssingel 50.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 1980s, when it became clear that the university would not relocate to Randwyck in its entirety, the city decided that the area would become a business district.
established$$$@@@%%%In the 1980s and 1990s, the city approved several large infrastructural projects, such as the new provincial government building along the river Meuse and the MECC convention centre, as well as the construction of office buildings and a small residential area in the district.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2008, local <a>housing association</a> Servatius began construction for a campus project entitled 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The ambitious project, designed by Spanish architect <a>Santiago Calatrava</a>, would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space.
established$$$@@@%%%The project was criticized early on for its environmental impact as a result of its abundant use of copper.
established$$$@@@%%%Soon after the start of construction, it became clear that the projected costs of the campus, estimated at &#x20ac; 165 mln, were unrealistic.
established$$$@@@%%%Servatius, having failed to secure additional investments, came under heavy political pressure and was forced to put the project on hold in May 2009.
established$$$@@@%%%In November 2009, the housing association announced that it had cancelled the campus project with immediate effect, as continuation would impair its ability to carry out its principle function to provide social housing in Maastricht.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Organisation</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Governance</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>As is common in the Netherlands, Maastricht University's teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of <a>faculties</a>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The names of organizational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university&#x2019;s organizational hierarchy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed School of Business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Faculties are governed by a faculty board, headed by a dean.
established$$$@@@%%%The dean has overall responsibility for policy and management at the faculty.
staff$$$@@@%%%Each faculty has a faculty council, a representative body the members of which are appointed for annual or biannual terms on the basis of elections by the faculty&#x2019;s staff and students.
established$$$@@@%%%Faculty councils have a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the faculty&#x2019;s teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.
mascot$$$@@@%%%In addition to the faculty boards and faculty councils, other bodies may be created within faculties for advising or consultation purposes.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a President, a Vice-President and a Rector.
faculty$$$@@@%%%The Executive Board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities.
established$$$@@@%%%The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, performs functions similar to those of faculty councils.
established$$$@@@%%%The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.</p>

city$$$@@@%%%Like all those at Maastricht University, its programmes revolve around Problem-Based Learning (PBL).</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Teaching</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of <a>problem-based learning</a> (PBL).
established$$$@@@%%%According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1974, Maastricht's newly-established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method.
staff$$$@@@%%%As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>At the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.
established$$$@@@%%%A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.
established$$$@@@%%%A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual.
established$$$@@@%%%Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting.
established$$$@@@%%%The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate.
established$$$@@@%%%The instructor, typically named 'tutor', plays only a limited role during tutorials.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Even though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used.
staff$$$@@@%%%As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course.
type$$$@@@%%%The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.</p>
