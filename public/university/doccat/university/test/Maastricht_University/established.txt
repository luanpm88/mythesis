<p><strong>Maastricht University</strong> (officially abbreviated as <strong>UM</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Maastricht</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>.
Founded in 1976, the university is the second youngest in the Netherlands.
The university's founding name was <strong>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</strong> and was changed into <strong>Universiteit Maastricht</strong> in 1996.
Since 2008 the name is Maastricht University, which the university claims will emphasize the international character.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maastricht University was officially established in 1976 to become the eighth public medical school in the Netherlands.
Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the national government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities.
Political leaders in the province of <a>Limburg</a>, most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the <a>Dutch Labour Party</a> and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht.
In an unusual decision, the newly established school decided not to await official recognition and to start its educational programme in September of 1974, promising an innovative approach to academic education by adopting a new teaching method known as <a>problem-based learning</a>.
By the end of 1975, the <a>Dutch Parliament</a> eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.
The new university, named <em>Rijksuniversiteit Limburg</em>, was officially established on January 9th, 1976, when <a>Queen Juliana of the Netherlands</a> signed the university&#x2019;s founding charter at a ceremony in Maastricht.
<p>Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to expand into other academic fields.
A Faculty of Law was created in 1981, to be followed by an economics faculty in 1984.
In the 1990s, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and the Faculty of Psychology were established.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the university started to establish schools and colleges, such as <a>University College Maastricht</a> (2002), one of the first liberal arts colleges in the Netherlands, and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (2004).
Often created as separate entities within the university, these new departments were later integrated in the university&#x2019;s faculty structure.
<p>The university was renamed <em>Universiteit Maastricht</em> in 1996 and switched to its current English-language name in 2008.
<p>Maastricht University  has two campuses: the city centre campus, consisting of a number of historic buildings housing the humanities and social sciences faculties, and the modern Randwyck campus in the southeastern part of the city, which has become the university&#x2019;s centre for the medical, health, psychology and life sciences.
Initial plans in the 1960s and 1970s, in line with infrastructural plans at other public universities in the Netherlands, envisaged a functional, single-campus university to be established in the largely undeveloped Randwyck district.
These plans never fully materialized, in part because university administrators and staff considered the UM&#x2019;s presence in the historic inner city to be important asset in attracting prospective students.
Instead, the university developed in a bipolar way with campuses at both sides of the river <a>Meuse</a>.
<p>In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of <a>Venlo</a>, the Belgian capital of <a>Brussels</a> and the city of <a>Bangalore, India</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The courtyard at Nieuwenhof, home of University College Maastricht.</a>The university&#x2019;s humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht&#x2019;s city centre, west of the river Meuse, at what can be described as an 'urban campus&#x2019; in the historic inner city.
Most of the university&#x2019;s inner city properties have official monumental status.
As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed significantly to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht&#x2019;s historic city centre.</p>
<p>The first building to be obtained by the university is the former <a>Jesuit</a> monastery at the Tongersestraat, where in 1974, the newly established medical school started its first academic year.
The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (&#x2018;mensa&#x2019;) and a large lecture hall (&#x2018;collegezaal&#x2019;).
The Faculty of Law is housed in the former provincial government building (<em>Oud Gouvernement</em>) at the Bouillonstraat (Nos.
1-3), which was constructed in 1935 and was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new building in the southeastern part of the city.
<p><a>thumb|right|The university's executive building at the Minderbroedersberg.</a><a>University
The <a>Maastricht Graduate School of Governance</a> has moved into the recently renovated <em>Hustinx Mansion</em> (1882) at the Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa&#x00e7;ade and a covered courtyard.
The only faculty in the inner city which is not located in the <em>Jekerkwartier</em> neighbourhood is the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
This faculty, founded in 1994, was initially housed at the Hustinx building, but currently occupies two historic, adjacent buildings north of the Vrijthof square: <em>Tilly Court</em>, built in 1714 as the residence for the military governor of Maastricht, and <em>Soiron Canon&#x2019;s House</em> (1786), located at the Grote Gracht.
<p><a>thumb|left|The university library's inner city branch at the Grote Looiersstraat.</a>The university&#x2019;s administrative headquarters is located in the <em>Minderbroedersberg</em> building, which dates back to 1699 and was originally built as a <a>Franciscan</a> monastery, was later used as a prison, and served as the regional court house for most of the twentieth century.
The UM acquired the building to become its administrative head office in 1999.
The Minderbroedersberg and the university&#x2019;s executive organization located here are colloquially referred to as &#x2018;de Berg&#x2019; (the Hill) by university employees for its physical location upon a small hill in the inner city, overlooking several other inner city locations.
This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent until 1798 and was afterwards for military purposes.
In the twentieth century, the city&#x2019;s main art museum, the <a>Bonnefantenmuseum</a>, was established here.
It became the main branch of the university library in 1979, until the library moved to its current location at the Grote Looiersstraat.
<p>The library building at the Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and after serving as the city&#x2019;s <a>poor house</a> for a few years, it was transformed into a military hospital which it remained until the 1920s.
Later, the building housed the city&#x2019;s public library until 1999, when it moved to its new location in the modern Ceramique district.
The building was then acquired by the UM.
<p><a>thumb|right|The Randwyck district in the southeastern part of Maastricht.</a>The
The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the sprawling university hospital, which moved from its original location in the western part of Maastricht to its current site in Randwyck in 1992.
The main university buildings, some of which are physically connected to the hospital, were built in the 1990s.
The medical faculty, the first to move to the Randwyck district, merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences in 2007 to become the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences.
The other faculty currently housed at Randwyck is the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience.
<p>In the early 1980s, when it became clear that the university would not relocate to Randwyck in its entirety, the city decided that the area would become a business district.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the city approved several large infrastructural projects, such as the new provincial government building along the river Meuse and the MECC convention centre, as well as the construction of office buildings and a small residential area in the district.</p>
<p>In 2008, local <a>housing association</a> Servatius began construction for a campus project entitled 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital.
The project was criticized early on for its environmental impact as a result of its abundant use of copper.
Soon after the start of construction, it became clear that the projected costs of the campus, estimated at &#x20ac; 165 mln, were unrealistic.
Servatius, having failed to secure additional investments, came under heavy political pressure and was forced to put the project on hold in May 2009.
In November 2009, the housing association announced that it had cancelled the campus project with immediate effect, as continuation would impair its ability to carry out its principle function to provide social housing in Maastricht.</p>
In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed School of Business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.</p>
The dean has overall responsibility for policy and management at the faculty.
Faculty councils have a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the faculty&#x2019;s teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.
<p>At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a President, a Vice-President and a Rector.
The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, performs functions similar to those of faculty councils.
The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.</p>
<p>Tuition fees at Maastricht University vary, depending on nationality and programme of study.
The University is currently considering an increase in tuition fees for the academic year 2011/2012.
A plan to introduce an institutional fee of &#x20ac; 950 for students at University College, which would be used to pay for scholarships and to maintain the College's overall quality standards, was shelved after criticism from staff and students.
UM administers several university-wide scholarship programmes for international students, including the UM High Potential Scholarships, UM Company Scholarships and Friends Make the Difference Scholarships.
The Limburg University Fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the UM, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets.
A special fund was created to support students from Southeast Asian countries hit by the 2004 tsunami.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences offers two bachelor programmes, seven undergraduate minors, eight postgraduate programmes, and has a Graduate School for Ph.D. students.
<li><a>B.A.</a> degree programmes: Arts and Culture, <a>European Studies</a></li>
<p>The Maastricht University School of Business and Economics is currently accredited by <a>EQUIS</a> (<a>press release</a>), <a>AACSB</a> (<a>press release</a>) and <a>Association of MBAs</a> (AMBA).
Students from the Maastricht University School of Business and Economics have also successfully participated in the case competitions at <a>McGill University</a> (<a>MMICC</a>) and the <a>University of Southern California</a> (USC) in 2006 (<a>website</a>).
<h4>Faculty of Law</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Faculty of Law, located at the former provincial government building.</a>Maastricht
University&#x2019;s Faculty of Law was founded in 1981.
It started with a programme in Dutch law, designed in line with UM&#x2019;s problem-based learning principles.
Ninety students enrolled in the first year.
The Faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof, which is currently home to the University College.
With the number students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location at the Bouillonstraat in 1990.
The Faculty celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2011.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the Faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focuses on European, comparative and international law.
The programme is taught partly in English.
A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007.
It is the first English-language bachelor&#x2019;s programme in law in the Netherlands.
It offers four bachelor&#x2019;s (<a>LL.B.</a>) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, a Dutch-language ELS and an English-language ELS.
<p>In research, the Faculty has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law.
In 1991, the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO) was founded, followed by the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights in 1993.
The Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht (Centre for European Parliamentary History and Constitutional Development), the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI) and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI) were established more recently.</p>
<li><a>Maastricht Graduate School of Governance</a> </li>
<p>The Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences started January 1, 2007.
The faculty was the result of a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine.
The Faculty of Medicine was the first Faculty to be established at Maastricht University.
The University was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, although the first medical students began their studies in September 1974.</p>
Since 1992 staff and students are based at the complex of buildings of the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Faculty of Psychology, and the University Hospital (Academic Hospital Maastricht) which opened in 1991.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Health Sciences offered a broad range of disciplines that made the faculty unique.
By way of research and specific (undergraduate and postgraduate) education, the Faculty of Health Sciences contributed to quality improvement in health care.</p>
<p>Founded in 1995, Maastricht University&#x2019;s Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary angles in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology.
The one year master programme psychology offers 6 different specialisations: neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology.
The two year research master in cognitive and clinical psychology offers four different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology and psychopathology.
<p>Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of <a>problem-based learning</a> (PBL).
According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.
In 1974, Maastricht's newly-established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method.
A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.
A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual.
Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting.
The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate.
The instructor, typically named 'tutor', plays only a limited role during tutorials.
<p><a>thumb|right|Student housing complex in the city centre, owned by Woonpunt housing association.</a>The
Of the 13,117 registered students in 2008, 39% were of a foreign nationality.
Other, non-EU foreign students, amounting to less than 2% of the total number of UM students, came from various countries in Europe (91), Asia (129), Africa (45), North America (33), Central and South America (15), and Oceania (29).
The university attracts a significant number of German students, especially in its economic, European Studies and psychology programmes.
<p>Maastricht University's academic staff, which has been growing over the past years, consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46.
Regarding the number of female professors, the university ranks lower than comparable universities in the Netherlands even though the number has been on the increase over the past years.
However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students.
Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.
<p>The university's independent newspaper, <em>Observant</em>, is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university.
It provides news, background articles, columns and educational information in Dutch and English, directed primarily at the university community.
<em>Studium Generale</em>, the university's cultural office, organizes lectures and cultural activities for members of the university community and the general public.</p>
