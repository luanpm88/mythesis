The college has two campuses, one in the <a>town of Brighton</a> and another, the Damon City Campus, in the <a>City of Rochester</a>.
It was founded in 1961.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1961, local physician Dr. Samuel J. Stabins recognized the need to prepare students to work in local hospitals and health care facilities, and thus MCC was founded.
On September 9, 1962, the doors of MCC&#x2019;s original campus swung open and welcomed 720 students.
Three years later, in June 1965, MCC became the first college in the nation to receive accreditation within three years of its founding.</p>
<p>Through the years, MCC has continually grown in degree programs, educational initiatives and facilities to meet the community&#x2019;s diverse needs.
The College also serves seventh through 12th graders in pre-collegiate programs, and incorporates community activism (service-learning) into its courses.
<p>To date, MCC has served more than a quarter of a million people.
Within the past several years, MCC has welcomed the additions of the Louis S. and Molly B. Wolk Center for Excellence in Nursing and the PAC fitness and recreational facility to help meet evolving educational needs of people throughout our region.
<p>MCC comprises two campuses:  the  main campus in the Town of <a>Brighton, New York</a> and the Damon City Campus housed on the fourth floor of the <a>Sibley Building</a>.
MCC also offers classes at the Applied Technologies Center for automotive technologies, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and precision tooling and machining.
In addition, the college trains the area's workforce through open enrollment and corporate training programs, serving small to mid-size employers such as Melles Griot and large employers including <a>Kodak</a> and <a>Xerox</a>.</p>
<p>Many students opt to take a &quot;2+2&quot; transfer program, in which they enroll in a program to earn their <a>associate Degree</a> in two years with the intent of transferring to a college or university &#x2014; primarily the <a>University of Rochester</a>, <a>Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Saint John Fisher College</a>, <a>Roberts Wesleyan College</a>, <a>SUNY Geneseo</a>, <a>SUNY Brockport</a>, <a>Nazareth College</a>, or the <a>Eastman School of Music</a> &#x2014; to complete a <a>bachelor's degree</a>.</p>
<p>Graduates of MCC have moved on to more than 100 different schools.
In 2005, 2,680 people graduated from the college.
Of those who transferred to another college, 62 percent chose one of the region's four-year colleges and universities.
Of those graduates who enrolled at MCC to prepare for a career, 89 percent stayed in the greater Rochester area and found work in business, communications, technology and health care.</p>
<p>Students maintain a regular <a>newspaper</a>, The Monroe Doctrine, which includes both a bi-weekly print version and an online version which can be accessed at [<a>http://www.monroedoctrine.org</a>].
<p>MCC offers smart classrooms, interactive <a>videoconferencing</a> capabilities, eight electronic learning centers (the largest of which has 100+ workstations), the Warshof Conference Center (open to the public), dental and <a>massage therapy</a> clinics, fitness and dance studios, a new <a>synthetic turf</a> field, and a variety of dining and restaurant options on campus.
The Brighton Campus, along with the Applied Technologies Center on West Henrietta Road, is completely wireless; while most of the Damon City Campus is equipped with '<a>hotspot</a>s.'
In 2003, the Alice Holloway Young Residence Halls opened on the Brighton Campus.
Each housing facility is equipped with modern technology services and has a strong sense of community.</p>
They provide a G.E.D program, a support network for parents and infants called 292-BABY, and an AmeriCorps program called <a>Rochester AmeriCorps</a>.</p>
