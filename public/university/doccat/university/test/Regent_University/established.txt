<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|Regent University - Robertson Hall, home to the School of Law and Robertson School of Government</a>Plans for the university (originally named CBN University) began in 1978 by <a>Christian Broadcasting Network</a> founder and current <a>Chancellor</a> <a>Pat Robertson</a>.
In 1990, the name was changed to Regent University.
The university's name is designed to reference a regent, who is someone that exercises power in a kingdom during the absence of the sovereign; according to the school's catalog, &quot;a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may be called to serve Him.&quot; <a>right|thumb|300px|The Regent University Library</a></p>
<p>Robertson's original vision for Regent University was that of a graduate institution.
Although Regent now offers undergraduate programs, the school has mostly remained true to its original focus.

<h2>University reputation</h2>
<p><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> ranks Regent University School of Law as a Tier 4 school,  the lowest ranking within the law school category.
The <a>Princeton Review</a> ranked Regent University seventh in the country for quality of life and the most conservative school.
The Sustainable Endowments Institute, an environmental report card, based in Cambridge, Mass., gave Regent a grade of D in its 2009 College Sustainability Report Card an improvement from the previous year's F grade.</p>
Previous wins took place in 1995 and 2002.</p>
The passage rate has improved every year from at least 2001, when the Regent University pass rate was 43.9 percent, compared to the state average of 73 percent.</p>
<p>In 1995, <a>Harvey Cox</a>, the liberal Harvard theologian, wrote that Regent has been called &quot;the Harvard of the <a>Christian Right</a>&quot; and noted that &quot;Regent, it appears, is not so much a boot camp for rightist cadres as a microcosm of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is often mistakenly seen as a monolithic 'religious right' in America&quot;.</p>
<p>While expressing concerns about Robertson's alleged past expressions of <a>antisemitism</a> (faculty blamed this on poorly chosen <a>ghost writers</a>) and associations with <a>dominion theology</a> promoting Christian control of secular institutions that some critics believe inspired the school's name, Cox said the faculty insisted that Regent didn't support <a>Dominionism</a>, pointing to the firing of <a>Herbert Titus</a>, the founding dean of the Law School, who was inclined to such a philosophy.
Cox characterized Regent's mission as continuing in the tradition of religiously trained professionals by various Catholic and Protestant faiths such as <a>Jesuit universities</a> and (originally) Harvard.
He found that <a>academic freedom</a> was promoted and that although half of the student body were either <a>Pentecostals</a> or <a>charismatics</a>, there existed a wider range of political attitudes than he first imagined.</p>
<p>In June 2007,  five of the eleven full-time faculty members of the School of Psychology &amp; Counseling's master's counseling program resigned.
<p>One professor said that there is a &quot;climate of fear and intimidation&#x201d; within the school.
A petition was circulated which criticized the behavior of the school's dean and the counseling department's program director said to have used the terms &quot;brothas&#x201d;, &#x201c;hoes&#x201d; and &#x201c;homos&#x201d;, though some students said the words were used in an &quot;academic context&quot;.</p>
<p>Shortly after this article was printed, Robertson announced that he was considering purchasing the daily newspaper but later decided against it.</p>
<h3>Freedom of expression controversy</h3>
<p>In September 2007, Adam Key, a second-year law student at Regent University, posted a photograph on the social networking website <a>Facebook</a> of the school's chancellor, <a>Pat Robertson</a>, unintentionally making an <a>obscene gesture</a>.
Additionally, Key criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of <a>Venezuela</a>n President <a>Hugo Chavez</a>.
While Key did remove the photograph, he refused to apologize and submitted his defense on the grounds it was <a>protected speech</a>.
Regent rejected his argument and Key was subsequently suspended and later removed.
However, Key's attorney countered with examples of <a>racist</a> images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action, implying that they were acceptable forms of speech.</p>
<p>Later the school contended its actions were unrelated to the photograph and that he was a &quot;security risk&quot;; Key's attorney countered with an internal memo sent the day before the suspension indicating that Robertson was concerned with Key's &quot;complaints&quot;. </p>
The judge ruled that despite federal funding, Regent's decisions were not <a>state actions</a> and hence not governed by the <a>First Amendment</a>.
He also found that Robertson had not defamed Keys and that &quot;generic recruiting correspondence&quot; from the school could not be considered a contract and thereby dismissed the fraud complaint.</p>
<p>In November 2007, a civil rights lawyer representing Key sent a complaint to the <a>American Bar Association</a> calling for them to revoke the school's <a>accreditation</a>. Key claims  the university suspended him for his political and religious views in violation of ABA accreditation standards.</p>
<p>According to Regent University, more than 150 of its graduates had been hired by the federal government during the <a>George W. Bush</a> presidency As it was previously rare for alumni to go into government, <em><a>Boston Globe</a></em> journalist <a>Charlie Savage</a> suggested that the appointment of <a>Office of Personnel Management</a> director <a>Kay Coles James</a>, the former dean of Regent's government school, caused this sharp increase in Regent alumni employed in the government.
<em><a>The Washington Post</a></em> contrasted the employment of Regent employees by Bush to the hiring practices of his successor <a>Barack Obama</a> who tended to select from higher tiered colleges.
Though a  prominent critic of the school, <a>Reverend Barry Lynn</a> of <a>Americans United for the Separation of Church and State</a> advised against &quot;underestimat[ing] the quality of a lot of the people that are there.&quot;
Also named Distinguished Professor was former <a>Chief of Naval Operations</a> <a>Admiral Vern Clark</a> who teaches courses in leadership and government.
In 2006, former <a>Israel</a>i <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Ehud Barak</a> was a visiting faculty member for the School of Undergraduate Studies.
<a>Herb Titus</a>, founding dean of the Law School, was the 1996 vice-presidential candidate of the <a>Constitution Party</a> and a drafter of the <a>Constitutional Restoration Act</a> to permit government officials to acknowledge &quot;God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government&quot;.
Titus was fired in 1993 for being &quot;too extreme&quot;.
notably the <a>theologian</a> <a>Graham Twelftree</a>, Dean Emeritus <a>H.
