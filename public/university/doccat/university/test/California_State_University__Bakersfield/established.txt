<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|The Walter Stiern Library, CSUB</a> CSUB owes its founding to the <a>Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960</a>, which formalized the creation of the CSU-system, initially as the &quot;California State Colleges&quot; system.
The areas in the Southern <a>San Joaquin Valley</a> had been demanding a four-year university since the 1950s.
After considering several locations, including nearby <a>Delano</a> and parts of <a>Kings</a> and <a>Tulare County</a>, a steering committee decided on Bakersfield because at the time it was the largest isolated metropolitan area in the United States without a four-year university.
Their decision was turned into a bill by Bakersfield's State Senator <a>Walter W. Stiern</a>, ratified by the <a>California State Legislature</a> and signed into law by Governor <a>Edmond G. Brown</a>.</p>
<p>Under these rules, the school was founded as California State College, Bakersfield in 1965.
It opened for classes in September 1970.
In 1982 the California State College system became the California State University system and the school changed to its present name.</p>
They began the process to move from <a>Division II</a> in 2006 and became a full Division I member starting in the 2010-11 school year.
