established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|250px|The Walter Stiern Library, CSUB</a> CSUB owes its founding to the <a>Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960</a>, which formalized the creation of the CSU-system, initially as the &quot;California State Colleges&quot; system.
established$$$@@@%%%The areas in the Southern <a>San Joaquin Valley</a> had been demanding a four-year university since the 1950s.
established$$$@@@%%%After considering several locations, including nearby <a>Delano</a> and parts of <a>Kings</a> and <a>Tulare County</a>, a steering committee decided on Bakersfield because at the time it was the largest isolated metropolitan area in the United States without a four-year university.
established$$$@@@%%%Their decision was turned into a bill by Bakersfield's State Senator <a>Walter W. Stiern</a>, ratified by the <a>California State Legislature</a> and signed into law by Governor <a>Edmond G. Brown</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Under these rules, the school was founded as California State College, Bakersfield in 1965.
established$$$@@@%%%It opened for classes in September 1970.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1982 the California State College system became the California State University system and the school changed to its present name.</p>
