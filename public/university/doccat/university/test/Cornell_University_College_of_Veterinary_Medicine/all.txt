established$$$@@@%%%<p> The <strong>New York State College of Veterinary Medicine</strong> at <a>Cornell University</a> was founded in 1894.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the first <a>statutory college</a> in <a>New York</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Before the creation of the college, instruction in <a>veterinary medicine</a> had been part of Cornell's curriculum since the university's founding.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1868, when Cornell opened, there was little formal study of veterinary medicine in the United States; with the creation of the <a>veterinary school</a>, Cornell became a pioneer in the field.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cornell co-founder <a>Ezra Cornell</a> requested the creation of a chair of veterinary medicine.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Cornell's other co-founder and first president, <a>Andrew Dickson White</a>, was asked by Ezra Cornell to find the best-qualified person to teach veterinary-related courses at the university.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. James Law, from the <a>Edinburgh Veterinary College</a> in <a>Scotland</a>, was chosen for this role.
established$$$@@@%%%Under pressure from Dr. Law, Cornell set unprecedented standards for veterinary degrees: four years' study for a <a>bachelor's degree</a> in the field, and two years' additional study for a <a>doctoral degree</a> in the field.
established$$$@@@%%%(Later, when New York State finally established Cornell's Veterinary College, a high school diploma would be required to be admitted to it, which was a high requirement for the time).
established$$$@@@%%%The first <a>D.V.M.</a> degree from Cornell was awarded in 1876 to <a>Daniel Elmer Salmon</a>, a man who went on to become the founding head of the <a>U.S. Bureau of Animal Industry</a>.
mascot$$$@@@%%%He is also noted for initiating the fight against contagious diseases.
established$$$@@@%%%The school was also a pioneer in educating female veterinarians.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>State legislation creating Cornell's Veterinary College was signed on March 21, 1894 by former New York Governor <a>Roswell P. Flower</a>, a man who had become convinced of the value of veterinary medicine to the health of people by virtue of prior personal farm experience.
established$$$@@@%%%The enabling legislation creating the college also provided state funds for a veterinary building at Cornell.
established$$$@@@%%%The building opened in the fall of 1896.
established$$$@@@%%%The state funded a new veterinary complex for Cornell and the college in 1957 on the east edge of the campus.
country$$$@@@%%%Today, this complex is the largest veterinary complex in higher education in the United States.</p>
