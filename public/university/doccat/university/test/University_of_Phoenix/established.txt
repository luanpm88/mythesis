<h2>History</h2>
University of Phoenix Headquarters, [[Phoenix, Arizona]]]]</p>
<p> The University of Phoenix was founded by <a>John Sperling</a>, who felt that &quot;working adult students were often invisible on traditional campuses and treated as second-class citizens.&quot;
Started in 1976 the <a>Phoenix metropolitan area</a>, In 1980, the school expanded to <a>San Jose, California</a>, and in 1989, the university launched its online program.</p>
<p>In 2000, the government fined UOP $6 million for failing to include study-group meetings as instructional hours.
<p>A 2003 federal whistle-blower/false-claims lawsuit filed by two former UOPX admission counselors alleged that the university improperly obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid by paying its admission counselors solely based on the number of students they enrolled, a violation of the <a>Higher Education Act</a>.
Six years later, Apollo, UOPX's parent company, agreed to settle the dispute by paying the United States $67.5 million, plus $11 in attorneys' fees, without acknowledging any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In 2004, as a result of the filing of the false-claims lawsuit, the Department of Education performed a program review and alleged that UOPX had violated <a>Higher Education Act</a> provisions that prohibit distributing financial incentives to admission representatives, had pressured its recruiters to enroll students, and had concealed the practices from the Department.
UOPX disputed the findings but paid a record $9.8 million fine as part of a settlement where it admitted no wrongdoing and was not required to return any financial aid funds.
That year, the school was also the top recipient of <a>student financial aid</a> funds, receiving nearly $2.48 billion.</p>
Department of Education</a> provided a preliminary report to the university that cited untimely return of unearned <a>Title IV</a> funds for more than 10 percent of sampled students.
The report also expressed a concern that some students enroll and begin attending classes before completely understanding the implications of enrollment, including their eligibility for student financial aid.
As a result, in January 2010, parent company Apollo Group Inc. was required to post a letter of credit for $125 million by January 30 of the same year.
Later that year, UOPX agreed to pay $1.89 million to settle allegations by the <a>EEOC</a> of religious <a>discrimination</a> favoring <a>Mormon</a> enrollment counselors.
<p>In 2010, UOPX came under government scrutiny after its Phoenix and Philadelphia campuses were found to have been engaging in deceptive enrollment practices and fraudulent solicitation of <a>FAFSA</a> funds.</p>
<p>[[File:Honolulu-CBrewer-frontdesk.JPG|thumb|right|The reception desk at Phoenix's Hawaii Campus, displaying a [[Service of Process]] placard]] The university has campuses and learning centers in 40 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and the Netherlands.

The first center opened in 2007 in <a>Plano, Texas</a>.
Students have access to class-specific online resources, which include an electronic library, textbooks, and other ancillary material required for a course.
<p>Through its online portal, eCampus, University of Phoenix students also have access to software required for coursework.
In addition to its traditional education programs, the school offers <a>continuing education</a> courses for teachers and practitioners, <a>professional development</a> courses for companies, and specialized courses of study for military personnel.</p>
The university also requires students to collaborate by working on learning team projects, wherein the class will be divided into learning teams of four to five students.
The concept of learning teams is somewhat uncommon in traditional academia; however, the University of Phoenix believes that collaborating on projects and having individuals rely on each other reflects the real working conditions of the corporate world.</p>

For the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the University of Phoenix student body received more Pell Grants ($656.9 million) than that of any other university.</p>
<p>The University of Phoenix was <a>regionally accredited</a> in 1978 by The <a>Higher Learning Commission</a> (HLC) as a member of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (NCA).
It also has accreditation for a variety of its specialty degree programs.</p>
<p>Phoenix's B.S. and M.S. degree programs in <a>nursing</a> are accredited by the <a>Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education</a> (CCNE), which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the <a>Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>.
The TEAC is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the <a>CHEA</a>.
The university has been cited as an example of for-profit colleges that operate to receive government educational subsidies.</p>
<p>The university paid $154.5 million for 20-year <a>naming rights</a> for advertising purposes of the <a>University of Phoenix Stadium</a> in <a>Glendale, Arizona</a>, a municipal sports arena, home of the <a>NFL</a>'s <a>Arizona Cardinals</a>, and the site of the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Tostitos Fiesta Bowl</a>.
The university does not itself participate in intercollegiate sports.</p>
The University of Phoenix was also named one of the nation's top 20 institutions of higher education favorable to military personnel, according to the December 2008 issue of <em>Military Advanced Education</em>.
<p>When calculated by the federal standard used by the <a>Department of Education</a>, UOPX's overall graduation rate is 16%, which, when compared to the national average of 55%, is among the nation's lowest.
The federal standard measures graduation rates as the percentage of first-time undergraduates who obtain a degree within six years.
The number is significantly lower at its Southern California campus (6%) and its online programs (4%).
The institution publishes its own nonstandard graduation rate of 59% to account for its large population of non-traditional students.
UOPX's instructors describe themselves as delivering course material, since most of the classes are centrally crafted and standardized across teachers in order to ensure consistency and reduce costs for the school.
<p> As of March 2010, 538,000 people have graduated from the University of Phoenix.
