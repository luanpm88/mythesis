<p> The <strong>University of North Carolina School of the Arts</strong> (<strong>UNCSA</strong>), formerly the <strong>North Carolina School of the Arts</strong>, is a public coeducational arts conservatory in <a>Winston-Salem</a>, <a>North Carolina</a> that grants high school, undergraduate and graduate degrees.
It is one of the seventeen constituent campuses of the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.
It was founded in 1963 as a conservatory of the performing arts by then-Governor <a>Terry Sanford</a> and was the first public arts conservatory.
The school owns and operates the <a>Stevens Center</a> in Downtown Winston-Salem and is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<li>School of Design and Production (including a Visual Arts Program)</li>
Performance is an integral part of the training program, and students, faculty and guest artists present more than 400 public performances and screenings annually in the School&#x2019;s facilities in Winston-Salem, as well as across the state and the Southeast, in major U.S. cities and overseas.</p>
With its full academic program, the School is accredited to award the high school diploma, the College Arts Diploma, the Professional Artist Certificate, and bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees.</p>
UNCSA is said to be one of the most exclusive arts conservatories in the world.
Of the more than 1,000 students enrolled, half come from two-thirds of North Carolina&#x2019;s 100 counties.
<p>Students study with resident master teachers who have had successful careers in the arts, such as the <a>New York City Ballet</a> and the <a>Los Angeles Philharmonic</a> and who remain active in their professions.
The premiere athletic event from the early 1970s was an annual touch-football game between a UNCSA team versus one from a Wake Forest University fraternity.</p>
<p>The question of &quot;How The Pickles got their name&quot; has come up with the passage of time since 1972 when the football team first took to the field as &quot;The NCSA Pickles&quot;.
Originally Beaux Arts was founded as a sort of rebel party run by the students, and the ball was actually a costume ball.
The festival was started in 1972 and included a large statue of a cow that was &quot;borrowed&quot; from a local business and became the symbol of the festival.
Eventually the festival became a school-run event.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>thumb|left|Terry Sanford </a> --&gt;The idea of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts was initiated in 1962 by Vittorio Giannini, the School's founder and first President, a leading American Composer and teacher of Composition at Juilliard, Curtis and Manhattan, who approached then governor <a>Terry Sanford</a> and enlisting help from <a>John Ehle</a> to support his dream of a school of the arts.
Through Giannini's vision the NCSA was created.
Later the North Carolina Conservatory Committee investigated the possibility of opening a state-supported music conservatory.
A resolution dated December 3, 1966 by the Board of Trustee of the NCSA and the Governor pays tribute to Giannini as &quot;the founder of the School noting that  &quot;When it was a dream, he sought a home for it and elped bring it into being.
When it was an infant institution, he gave it structure and design.&quot;
Importantly, Giannini left a legacy of arts education that continues to serves as a model.
He established that the School's President must be a noted composer.
When the school was founded, the focus was broadened to include dance and drama, and the Enabling Act of the school, passed in 1963 by the North Carolina General Assembly, founded a school for &quot;the professional training, as distinguished from the liberal arts instruction, of talented students in the fields of music, drama, the dance and allied performing arts, at both the high school and college levels of instruction, with emphasis placed upon performance of the arts, and not upon academic studies of the arts.&quot;
The Gray High School was bought to house the new conservatory and <a>Vittorio Giannini</a>, an American composer, was picked as the first president of the school (the title would later be changed to chancellor).</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>thumb|right|Vittorio Giannini </a> --&gt;Composer <a>Robert Ward</a> became NCSA's second president following the unexpected death of Giannini in 1966.
In 1968 the School of Design and Production (informally known as D&amp;P) was created, and in 1970 a subsection of the D&amp;P program, the visual arts program, was created as well.
In addition, the school became a part of the newly formed University of North Carolina system in 1972.
During his time at UNCSA the Workplace building, containing the Semans Library, was opened on the UNCSA campus, as well as the <a>Stevens Center</a>, previously the Carolina Theatre, in downtown Winston-Salem.
The gala opening featured the UNCSA symphony orchestra, conducted by <a>Leonard Bernstein</a>, with <a>Isaac Stern</a> as soloist and <a>Gregory Peck</a> as the Master of Ceremonies.
Attendees included <a>Agnes de Mille</a>, <a>Cliff Robertson</a>, <a>Governor James Hunt</a>, President and Mrs. <a>Gerald Ford</a> and <a>Lady Bird Johnson</a>.
Jane E. Milley was the fourth chancellor of UNCSA and was installed in 1984.
Although she increased faculty salaries and secured funding for a new facility dubbed Performance Place she was forced out of the school by students who found her too academic.</p>
<p>Alex Ewing was appointed as the fifth chancellor of UNCSA in 1990.
His biggest accomplishment was the establishment of UNCSA's fifth arts school, the School of Film.
He also helped bring the Thomas S. Kenan Institute for the Arts to the School and increased the endowment from $4 million to $15 million.</p>
<p>Wade Hobgood was UNCSA's sixth chancellor, starting in 2000.
He helped UNCSA secure five new buildings, a Center for Design Innovation and free tuition for all North Carolina high school residents in his five years tenure.</p>
He was installed on July 1, 2006 and maintains an active performance career in addition to his duties as chancellor and has encouraged the teachers and deans to do so.
As of 2010, he had appointed three new deans, <a>Ethan Stiefel</a> as the Dean of the School of Dance, <a>Jordan Kerner</a> as the Dean of the School of Filmmaking and <a>Wade Weast</a> as the Dean of the School of Music.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2008, the UNCSA Board of Trustees voted unanimously to support a name change of the school from the North Carolina School of the Arts to the &quot;University of North Carolina School of the Arts.&quot;
The reasons given for the change were to raise the profile of the school as part of the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system.
The name change was approved by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors on May 9, 2008, the <a>North Carolina Senate</a> on June 24, 2008, and the <a>North Carolina House of Representatives</a> on July 11, 2008.
The law was signed into law by Governor <a>Mike Easley</a> and took effect in August 2008.
A group of alumni have attempted to register &quot;UNCSA&quot; as a <a>federal trademark</a> to block the change.</p>

<p> UNCSA offers many performance opportunities throughout the course of a school year.
<p>The School of Design and Production is responsible for the scenery, costumes, wigs, makeup, lighting, sound, and stage management for all shows produced by the School of Drama, two operas that UNCSA produces each year through the Fletcher Opera Institute, as well as dance performances, although dance costumes are provided by the School of Dance's own professional costume shop.</p>
All students have the opportunity to audition.
Past all-school musicals have included <em><a>Brigadoon</a></em>, <em><a>Oklahoma!</a></em>, <em><a>Kiss Me Kate</a></em>, and <em>Canterbury Tales</em>, with the most recent one being <a>Leonard Bernstein</a>'s <em><a>West Side Story</a></em> (for the 50th anniversary).
For example, for <em>West Side Story</em> the lead roles and Chancellor John Mauceri traveled to New York to promote the school and the school's revival of the musical.
<em>West Side Story</em> was performed at UNCSA's Stevens Center from May 3-13, 2007, and then went on tour to <a>Chicago</a>'s <a>Ravinia Festival</a> on June 8, 2007.
The production was directed by Dean of Drama <a>Gerald Freedman</a>, the assistant director of the original production, and conducted by UNCSA Chancellor and world renown conductor <a>John Mauceri</a>.
It has also been reported that <a>Arthur Laurents</a> changed portions of the dialogue for the UNCSA production.</p>
<p>UNCSA offers five week summer courses in dance, filmmaking, visual arts, and drama, as well as two week courses in voice, guitar, and percussion, and a three week course in stage combat, to middle school, high school, and college students seeking intensive study in the arts.
