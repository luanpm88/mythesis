<p>Although UNCSA has no officially-sanctioned athletic teams, students are very proud of their mascot: The Fighting Pickle.
The answer is very simple: a contest was held to name the football team.
<p>In the spring of 2010, UNCSA hosted a competition to choose the new, official &quot;Fighting Pickle&quot; mascot.
The North Carolina General Assembly also gave the new school $350,000.
