established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History and surroundings</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A small Bible school was commenced in Melbourne in 1892, on the counsel of <a>Ellen G. White</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%She preferred a rural location, and as a result a search for a rural location was commenced in 1893.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Cooranbong shopping district and Freeman's drive now occupy some of the land that was part of the <a>Avondale Estate</a>, creating a disjoint estate.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The Avondale Schools (a separate entity) and the Cooranbong Aerodrome (which up until 2006 was used as part of the aviation certificate training) are located on one section and the college on the other.
established$$$@@@%%%The nearby Sunnyside museum has photographs of the college through its early years.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Educational philosophy</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1890s, Ellen White reformed the curriculum to make the <a>Bible</a> the center of study, in place of the <a>classics</a>.
