<p>  <strong>Avondale College</strong> is an Australian tertiary education provider affiliated with the <a>Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>.
The other campus is the Sydney campus located at the <a>Sydney Adventist Hospital</a> in the <a>Sydney</a>-suburb of <a>Wahroonga</a>, housing most of the faculty of nursing and health.
Avondale College primarily focuses in the areas of <a>teaching</a>, <a>theology</a>, and <a>nursing</a>, but also offers <a>bachelor's degree</a>s in business, science and the arts as well as certificate studies in outdoor recreation.
The nursing programme commences at the Cooranbong campus for one or two semesters and is completed at the <a>Sydney Adventist Hospital</a> with hands-on experience gained in the hospital.
<a>Master's degree</a>s are offered in theology, education, nursing, ministry, and some business related fields by distance education, including a one-month on-campus component in the winter semester.</p>
<p>Avondale College is an institution under the <a>South Pacific Division of Seventh-day Adventists</a>.
The library contains a local research centre of the <a>Ellen G. White Estate</a>.</p>
<h2>History and surroundings</h2>
<p>A small Bible school was commenced in Melbourne in 1892, on the counsel of <a>Ellen G. White</a>.
She preferred a rural location, and as a result a search for a rural location was commenced in 1893.</p>
<p>The Cooranbong shopping district and Freeman's drive now occupy some of the land that was part of the <a>Avondale Estate</a>, creating a disjoint estate.
The nearby Sunnyside museum has photographs of the college through its early years.</p>
<p>During the 1890s, Ellen White reformed the curriculum to make the <a>Bible</a> the center of study, in place of the <a>classics</a>.
The refurbished Chan-Shun Auditorium is based on the original auditorium.</p>
<p>Shortly after 1951, students could study a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> through the external program of the <a>University of London</a>, and a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> through <a>Pacific Union College</a>.
Avondale has offered PhD degrees since 2006 when it was approved to do so by the <a>New South Wales Department of Education and Training</a>.
However, it is expected that the school will be sold during 2009., but as of mid 2010 the sale is being finalised.</p>
<li><a>Faculty of Business and Information Technology</a></li>
The first covers salvation and Christian belief and lifestyle, while the second has a more specifically Adventist focus.
<p>Avondale is the primary place of training for ministers in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia and New Zealand, and also has many students from the islands of the South Pacific.
It is also open to students of any denomination.</p>
<p>The College runs <a>Avondale Academic Press</a>, a small <a>academic publisher</a>.
The College is currently in the process of applying for and receiving University status from the <a>Australian government</a>.</p>
