<p> &lt;!-- see usgs gnis in external links --&gt;  <strong>The Catholic University of America</strong> (CUA), is a <a>private university</a> located in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, <a>USA</a>.
It is a <a>pontifical university</a> of the <a>Catholic Church</a> in the USA and the only higher education institution founded by <a>the body of U.S. Catholic bishops</a>.
Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by <a>Pope Leo XIII</a> on Easter Sunday, the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904.</p>
<p>The university's campus lies within the <a>Brookland</a> neighborhood, known as &quot;Little Rome&quot;, which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including <a>Trinity Washington University</a> and the <a>Dominican House of Studies</a>.</p>
The school stays closely connected with the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations.
The university has a long history of working with the <a>Knights of Columbus</a>; the university's law school and basilica have dedications to the involvement and support of the Knights.</p>
On April 16, 2008, Pope <a>Benedict XVI</a> came to the campus's Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center and gave an address on Catholic education and academic freedom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1882 Bishop <a>John Lancaster Spalding</a> went to Rome to obtain <a>Pope Leo XIII</a>'s support for the University and persuaded family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it.
On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical <em>Magni Nobis</em>,  granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of <a>Catholicism</a> and <a>human nature</a> together at the graduate level.
By developing new leaders and new knowledge, it was believed that the University would strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States.</p>
<p>The founders wished to emphasize the Church&#x2019;s special role in United States.
They had a conviction that <a>scientific</a> and <a>humanistic</a> research, informed by faith, would strengthen the Church.
They hoped to develop a national <a>institution</a> that would promote the faith in a context of <a>religious freedom</a>, spiritual pluralism, and intellectual rigor.</p>
<p>When the University first opened for classes in the fall of 1888, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and <a>moral philosophy</a>, <a>English literature</a>, the <a>Sacred Scripture</a>s, and the various branches of <a>theology</a>.
At the end of the second term, lectures on <a>canon law</a> were added and the first students were graduated in 1889.
Between 1900 and 1940, more than 50 international Catholic institutions rented or owned property in neighboring <a>Brookland</a>.
During the post World War II years, Catholic University experienced an expansion in enrollment thanks to the <a>G.I.
<p> The CUA campus is in the residential community of <a>Brookland</a> in <a>Northeast Washington</a>; its main entrance is 620 Michigan Ave., NE.
It is three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of the <a>Capitol building</a>.</p>
Between McMahon and Gibbons halls and alongside the <a>Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</a> runs The Mall, a large strip of grass that is often the site of kickball games and sunbathers.
<a>Conte</a> Circle is in the middle of Centennial Village, a cluster of eight residential houses.</p>
<p>The Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center was opened in the spring of 2003, bringing student dining services, the campus bookstore, student organization offices, an 800-person ballroom, a convenience store, and more student services under one roof.
The John K. Mullen Library completed a $6,000,000 renovation in 2004, significantly improving the lighting and aesthetics of the interior and allowing the classical architecture to better shine through.</p>
<p>The <a>Columbus School of Law</a> is on the main campus and is self-contained in its own building with moot courtrooms, a library, chapel, classrooms, and offices.
On the Pryzbyla Center side of the building is the Law School Lawn, where the <a>ultimate Frisbee</a> team can often be found.
Theological College, the United States's national seminary, is located across Michigan Avenue from the main campus and sits between the Dominican House of Studies, a seminary for the <a>Order of Preachers</a>, and offices for the <a>Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>.
Trinity Washington University is also near the university and is a quarter mile south along Michigan Avenue.
<a>thumb|McGivney Hall</a> In April 2004, the University purchased  of land from the <a>Armed Forces Retirement Home</a>.
<p>In 2007, the University unveiled plans to expand the campus by adding three new dorms to the north side of campus.
The first of these dorms, the seven-story tall Opus Hall, houses 420 upper-class students, making it the largest dorm on campus.
<p>The Campus is served by the <a>Brookland-CUA</a> station on the <a>Red Line</a> of the <a>Washington Metro</a>.
<p>CUA has environmental sustainability programs including participation in Earth Day, <a>Casey Trees</a> tree planting, and Campus Beautification Day.
CUA constructed its most recent building, Opus Hall, as <a>LEED</a>-compliant, and purchases 30% of its electricity from green sources.
The university is participating in the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card rating.:</p>

<p>Although the University continues to be under censure by the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) for academic freedom violations and continues to ban certain speakers from campus, CUA has made a general statement of policy that the academic freedom of its faculty and students will be respected.
In addition, it offers ecclesiastical degrees (i.e., licensees to teach Catholic Theology) in Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology, Moral Theology/Ethics, and Historical and Systematic Theology.
In order to teach theology at The Catholic University of America, one must be licensed to teach Catholic Theology by the Vatican.</p>
<p>In 1967, tenured professor Reverend <a>Charles E. Curran</a> was fired for his views on birth control, but was reinstated after a five-day faculty-led strike.
In 1986, the Vatican declared that Curran could no longer teach theology at Catholic University of America schools, because &quot;clashes with church authorities finally culminated in a decision by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by then-Cardinal (and now Pope) <a>Josef Ratzinger</a>, that Curran was neither suitable nor eligible to be a professor of Catholic theology.&quot;
The areas of dispute included publishing articles that debated theological and ethical views regarding divorce, &quot;artificial contraception&quot;, &quot;masturbation, pre-marital intercourse and homosexual acts.&quot;
As noted in the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> report, &quot;Had it not been for the intervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Professor Curran would undoubtedly still be active in the university's Department of Theology, a popular teacher, honored theologian, and respected colleague.&quot;
<p>In 1989, he filed suit against Catholic University, and the court determined that the University had the right to fire him for teaching views in contradiction to the school's religion.</p>
<p>In 1990, the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) defended Curran and censured the Catholic University of America due to its failure to adhere to the AAUP's Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, and that it found that &quot;unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail&quot; at the Catholic University of America.
, the Catholic University remains on the list of censured institutions.
Current CUA President <a>David M. O'Connell</a> refuses to do either stating, &quot;Every American university has a right to govern itself according to its own identity, mission, standards and procedures.&quot;
In a controversy not involving CUA in the 1980s, the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>  noted &quot;the right of an institution to pursue its established educational purpose,&quot; supports the &quot;governing board&quot; decisions on upholding &quot;the interests of the founders, the supporting religious group, the supporting governmental agency, or other supporting party.&quot;</p>
<p>I consider any pro-choice advocacy &#x2014; whether deliberate or accidental, whether presented under the guise of academic freedom or right to free speech &#x2014; as incompatible with that fidelity and not worthy of The Catholic University of America.</p>
<p>The next year, in 2005, the school was criticized for initially rejecting an application for recognition of a student chapter of the NAACP; one of the reasons officials cited in its rejection was the national organization's pro-choice stance.
In 2006 the CUA administration barred a student-run on-campus performance of <a>Eve Ensler</a>'s <em><a>The Vagina Monologues</a></em>.
The Editorial Board of the student newspaper <em>The Tower</em>, in supporting the decision to ban the production, stated that &quot;as much as we love variety, diversity and open-mindedness, this University is not the best place for that to flourish.&quot;</p>
Members of the Cardinal Newman Society heavily criticized the organization.
The College Republicans responded with a statement criticizing the restrictiveness of the policy.</p>
<p>Although the Catholic University states that it does not have any Greek life on campus, it in fact has two social Greek organizations and one service Greek organization.
<a>Catholic University Greek Life</a> includes <a>Alpha Delta Gamma</a> the National Catholic Social Fraternity&ndash;Kappa chapter, <a>Kappa Tau Gamma</a> the local Christian Social-Service Sorority, and <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> the National Service Fraternity&ndash;Zeta Mu chapter which is co-ed.</p>
The Student Association included two original parts: the General Assembly, as an advocacy body, and the Student Fee Allocation Board which serves as the steward of the Student Activity and Club Sports Fee.
<p>The graduate student government is a separate entity and was not affected by the changes during the 2006-2007 academic year.
The campus ministry has two groups of <em>student</em> ministers: the &quot;resident ministers&quot; who live in residence halls and focus primarily on <a>upperclassmen</a> and the &quot;house members,&quot; who focus on <a>freshmen</a>.</p>
<p>The DuFour Athletic Center has hosted <a>The Alarm</a>, <a>The Fixx</a>, <a>Black 47</a>, <a>Gavin DeGraw</a>, <a>Brandi Carlile</a>, <a>The Hooters</a>, <a>They Might Be Giants</a>, <a>Howie Day</a>, and <a>The Ataris</a>.
Comedy acts include <a>Ben Stein</a> and Big Al Goodwin.
The university's Program Board, which puts on many of the concerts on campus as well as the annual Mistletoe Ball, provides other activities for the entire CUA community.
The school competes in <a>football</a> in the <a>Old Dominion Athletic Conference</a>, in men's <a>baseball</a>, <a>softball</a>, women's <a>volleyball</a> and <a>field hockey</a>, and in men's and women's <a>cross country</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>tennis</a>, and indoor and outdoor <a>track and field</a>, in the <a>Landmark Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Students field club teams in sports including <a>cheerleading</a>, <a>ice hockey</a>, <a>rugby</a>, <a>dance</a>, and <a>rowing</a>.</p>
