established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1882 Bishop <a>John Lancaster Spalding</a> went to Rome to obtain <a>Pope Leo XIII</a>'s support for the University and persuaded family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it.
established$$$@@@%%%On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical <em>Magni Nobis</em>,  granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of <a>Catholicism</a> and <a>human nature</a> together at the graduate level.
established$$$@@@%%%By developing new leaders and new knowledge, it was believed that the University would strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The founders wished to emphasize the Church&#x2019;s special role in United States.
established$$$@@@%%%They had a conviction that <a>scientific</a> and <a>humanistic</a> research, informed by faith, would strengthen the Church.
established$$$@@@%%%They hoped to develop a national <a>institution</a> that would promote the faith in a context of <a>religious freedom</a>, spiritual pluralism, and intellectual rigor.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When the University first opened for classes in the fall of 1888, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and <a>moral philosophy</a>, <a>English literature</a>, the <a>Sacred Scripture</a>s, and the various branches of <a>theology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the end of the second term, lectures on <a>canon law</a> were added and the first students were graduated in 1889.
faculty$$$@@@%%%In 1904, an <a>undergraduate</a> program was added and it quickly established a reputation for excellence.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Academic freedom</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although the University continues to be under censure by the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) for academic freedom violations and continues to ban certain speakers from campus, CUA has made a general statement of policy that the academic freedom of its faculty and students will be respected.
staff$$$@@@%%%It considers academic freedom a &quot;fundamental condition for research and dissemination of information.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, it offers ecclesiastical degrees (i.e., licensees to teach Catholic Theology) in Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology, Moral Theology/Ethics, and Historical and Systematic Theology.
established$$$@@@%%%In order to teach theology at The Catholic University of America, one must be licensed to teach Catholic Theology by the Vatican.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<h4>American Association of University Professors censure</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1967, tenured professor Reverend <a>Charles E. Curran</a> was fired for his views on birth control, but was reinstated after a five-day faculty-led strike.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1986, the Vatican declared that Curran could no longer teach theology at Catholic University of America schools, because &quot;clashes with church authorities finally culminated in a decision by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by then-Cardinal (and now Pope) <a>Josef Ratzinger</a>, that Curran was neither suitable nor eligible to be a professor of Catholic theology.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The areas of dispute included publishing articles that debated theological and ethical views regarding divorce, &quot;artificial contraception&quot;, &quot;masturbation, pre-marital intercourse and homosexual acts.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%As noted in the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> report, &quot;Had it not been for the intervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Professor Curran would undoubtedly still be active in the university's Department of Theology, a popular teacher, honored theologian, and respected colleague.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%Curran's attorneys argued that CUA did not follow proper procedures or its own policy statements in handling the case.
city$$$@@@%%%In essence, CUA claimed that the Vatican's actions against Curran trumped any campus-based policy or tenure rules.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1989, he filed suit against Catholic University, and the court determined that the University had the right to fire him for teaching views in contradiction to the school's religion.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1990, the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) defended Curran and censured the Catholic University of America due to its failure to adhere to the AAUP's Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, and that it found that &quot;unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail&quot; at the Catholic University of America.
established$$$@@@%%%, the Catholic University remains on the list of censured institutions.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The two conditions for having the censure removed are inviting Curran, whose license to teach Catholic Theology had been suspended by the Vatican, back to campus and changing the University's &quot;Statement on Academic Freedom.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Current CUA President <a>David M. O'Connell</a> refuses to do either stating, &quot;Every American university has a right to govern itself according to its own identity, mission, standards and procedures.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In a controversy not involving CUA in the 1980s, the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>  noted &quot;the right of an institution to pursue its established educational purpose,&quot; supports the &quot;governing board&quot; decisions on upholding &quot;the interests of the founders, the supporting religious group, the supporting governmental agency, or other supporting party.&quot;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Speaker policy</h4>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|250px|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI about to address the crowd in the Pryzbyla Center</a> The University as a policy does not allow outside guests to speak on campus to any audience if they have previously expressed an opinion on abortion rights or other serious issues conflicting with the Catholic Church's official position.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Applying this policy in 2004, CUA was criticized for rescinding <a>Stanley Tucci</a>'s invitation for a seminar about Italian cinema, because he had lent past support for <a>Planned Parenthood</a>.</p>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>In a letter to the campus that next month, university President <a>David O'Connell</a> wrote: </p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>I consider any pro-choice advocacy &#x2014; whether deliberate or accidental, whether presented under the guise of academic freedom or right to free speech &#x2014; as incompatible with that fidelity and not worthy of The Catholic University of America.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The next year, in 2005, the school was criticized for initially rejecting an application for recognition of a student chapter of the NAACP; one of the reasons officials cited in its rejection was the national organization's pro-choice stance.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2006 the CUA administration barred a student-run on-campus performance of <a>Eve Ensler</a>'s <em><a>The Vagina Monologues</a></em>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Editorial Board of the student newspaper <em>The Tower</em>, in supporting the decision to ban the production, stated that &quot;as much as we love variety, diversity and open-mindedness, this University is not the best place for that to flourish.&quot;</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The speaker policy gained national attention again in 2008 when the CUA College Republicans, the University's largest student organization, hosted former <a>Homeland Security</a> Secretary <a>Tom Ridge</a>.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Ridge once campaigned on a moderate pro-choice platform despite being a Catholic.
