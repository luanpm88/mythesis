<p>  <strong>Southeastern Louisiana University</strong> is a state-funded public <a>university</a> in <a>Hammond</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>.
It was founded in 1925 by <a>Linus A. Sims</a>, the <a>principal</a> of <a>Hammond</a> <a>High School</a>, as <a>Hammond Junior College</a>, located in a wing of the high school building.
Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College.
It achieved university status in 1970.
During the 1990s Southeastern was the fastest-growing college in the United States.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>240px|thumb|left|Commons Area in Southeastern's War Memorial Student Union</a> What began as a junior college supported by local taxes developed into a major university as Southeastern has grown to meet the evolving needs of southeast Louisiana and the Florida parishes.
<p>On July 7, 1925, the voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue that created Hammond Junior College.
Operated under the auspices of the Tangipahoa Parish <a>School Board</a>, Sims opened the doors on September 13, 1925, with a faculty of three women and two men and 40  students.
<p>Rapidly increasing enrollments quickly forced the college out of its two rooms in Hammond High School.
In 1927, voters supported the purchase of the Hunter Leake estate on Hammond&#x2019;s north end.
In 1928, Hammond Junior College became Southeastern Louisiana College, formally adopted into the state educational system under the control of the State Board of Education.
The purchase of  adjoining the original  plot provided the space to develop a suitable campus.
In 1934, a state bond issue provided for the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium.
<p>Lucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935.
As of 2009 it is the oldest building constructed by the University.
<p>In 1937, the State Board of Education authorized curricula for four-year programs in liberal arts, teacher education, business administration, music, social sciences, and physical education.
The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred in May 1939.

Zachary Taylor Hall is the only academic building in Louisiana named for the sole <a>President</a> to come from Louisiana.]]
Voter approval of Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted Southeastern Louisiana College the same legal status as other four-year colleges.
The amendment did not, however, require the state to fund Southeastern at the level of other institutions of higher education, despite strong local support.
<p>On January 18, 1946, the State Board made available funds to purchase seven city blocks east and west of the campus, and  of land north and northwest of the campus, increasing Southeastern&#x2019;s total area to approximately .
<p>On March 3, 1946, Southeastern was formally approved and accepted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as a four-year degree-granting institution.

<p>After World War II, returning G.I.s caused exponential growth of the college, necessitating construction of classrooms, a student union, a cafeteria, a health center, dormitories, apartments for married students, and many surplus temporary buildings donated by the federal government.
In 1948, the U.S. Navy contributed two steel barracks for use as dormitories including McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007).
Southeastern began awarding the Education Specialist degree in 1967.
Governor John J. McKeithen on June 16, 1970, signed into law the legislative act turning Southeastern Louisiana College into Southeastern Louisiana University.
<p>After years of planning and fundraising, the <a>Southeastern Louisiana University Center</a> was constructed.
McGehee Hall, a sturdy example of <a>Depression Gothic</a> architecture, is on the <a>National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana</a>.
Shown is the intricate masonry of the southwest corner.
<p>In October 1986, a group of faculty members launched Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities and sciences.
Pervasive professional accreditations, such as accreditation of the College of Business by <a>AACSB</a>, and excellent egress from/to <a>I-55</a> and <a>I-12</a> figure significantly in the increase.
<p>As Southeastern celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2000, the fall semester marked an exciting change as Southeastern implemented screened admissions standards for the first time.
<p>In May 2001, Southeastern received full approval from the Board of Regents for its first new graduate degree program in more than a decade, an MS in Integrated Science and Technology.
Since then, Southeastern received approval for seven additional programs: MA in Organizational Communications, MS in Applied Sociology, BS in Athletic Training, BS in Health Education &amp; Promotion, BS in Health Studies, BS in Occupational Health, Safety &amp; Environment, and Master of Arts in Teaching.
Fall 2003 also saw the return of football to Strawberry Stadium, after an 18-year hiatus.
<p>In Fall 2004, Southeastern began implementing portions of the Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criteria, a full year ahead of schedule and before any other schools in the state.</p>
<p>In Fall 2005, Southeastern began its first year under the full Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criterion.
In the same semester Southeastern, which was virtually undamaged by <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>, absorbed some two thousand students whom the storm had displaced from institutions in <a>New Orleans</a>.
North of the War Memorial Student Union is a large fountain constructed and dedicated in 2007 to the victims of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a> and <a>Hurricane Rita</a>; as of 2009 it is the only such memorial fountain in existence.</p>
Initiated by the students and paid for by student fees and parking permits, it is one of only two parking garages on public university campuses in Louisiana.
<p>A Southeastern alumnus is <a>State Representative</a> <a>Donald Ray Kennard</a>, who has represented parts of <a>East Baton Rouge</a> and <a>Livingston</a> parishes since 1976.
<p>Southeastern has a demonstrated record of service, offering its <a>University Center</a> for <a>commencement</a> exercises of high schools throughout the <a>Northshore Region</a> and actively encouraging area high school students to continue on to the university level.</p>
<p>Southeastern owns the <a>Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts</a> in Hammond's Historic District.
The Columbia Theatre, first opened in 1928, was acquired by the University in the 1990s and renovated for $5.6 million.
The large foyer is dedicated to <a>State Senator</a> <a>John Hainkel</a>, who was instrumental in obtaining the funding for the renovation.</p>
<p>Southeastern Louisiana University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS) to award degrees at the Associate, Baccalaureate and Master's levels.

In a consortium with the <a>University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a> Southeastern offers a  <a>master of science in nursing</a>.</p>
<p>Southeastern became a doctoral-granting institution in 2005 with the inauguration of a <a>doctor of education</a> in higher education leadership.</p>
Southeastern was the first institution in Louisiana to achieve AACSB's separate and special <a>accreditation in accounting.</a>
Dr <strong><a>Cris Koutsougeras</a></strong> was hired from Tulane to head that Department.</p>

<p>KSLU began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at Southeastern Louisiana University, operating at 10 watts of power.
Initially the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during the weekends and during the holidays.
Since that time the station has grown to 3,000 watts, the maximum allowed because of the crowded 88-92&nbsp;MHz band and the university's proximity to Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
<p>In 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in the South to install a digital touchscreen operating system.
The installation was featured in Broadcast Engineering magazine and visited by radio personnel from across the world.
The underpass provides safe and convenient egress between the north and south campuses.
The view is from the north.]]
The broadcast schedule offers a vast array of non-commercial programs which both enlighten and entertain.
<p>In 1993, an emergency situation room was added utilizing amateur radio equipment purchased with grants from <a>State Farm Insurance</a> and Louisiana Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of <a>Entergy</a>).
During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the Florida parish area.
<p>In the past, the station produced several political forums which were fed to all public radio stations in Louisiana and to commercial stations via the Louisiana News Network.
<p>The year 1996 brought another exciting time as KSLU began broadcasting globally via the internet, enabling families of international and out-of-state students to hear live university events.</p>
<p><em>ByLion</em> is published weekly online (bi-weekly during the summer session) for the faculty and staff of Southeastern Louisiana University.
