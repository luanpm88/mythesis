<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Inauguration of the old college campus, April 8, 1985</a></p>
<p>In November 1984 the college was granted permission to conduct engineering courses in the disciplines of <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>, <a>Electronics and Communication Engineering</a> and <a>Computer Science Engineering</a>, awarded by the <a>University of Madras</a>.</p>
<p>The college complex at Nazarathpet (near <a>Poonamallee</a>) was inaugurated on April 8, 1985 by Sri <a>S.L Khurana</a>, former <a>Governor</a> of <a>Tamil Nadu</a>.</p>

The <a>Principal</a> of the college is Dr.R Ramachandran who is a Professor in the Department of <a>Computer Science and Engineering</a>, having previously served as Professor and Head of the Departments of <a>Information Technology</a> and Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
<p><a>thumb|SVCE's main block houses the library and administration blocks</a> SVCE went under the government scrutiny with the Directorate of Technical Education (DOTE) intensifying its drive against the collection of capitation fee and tuition fee in excess of that prescribed.</p>
<p>It was found that a donation of  was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to the SPIC Educational Trust.
DOTE officials claimed they would initiate legal action against the college and also ask the <a>AICTE</a> to cancel its recognition in the forthcoming academic year.
<p>The crackdown by the Directorate of Technical Education officials on the college did not, however, stop the filling up of its seats under the single window system in the first few days of the 2007 DOTE counselling.</p>
The ground floor is air-conditioned, with conferencing, multimedia, internet, reprography facilities, a CD-ROM collection and a book bank for deserving students.
<a>thumb|The central library</a> The college subscribes to most major technical journals including those by the <a>IEEE</a>, ACM and ASME.
The library uses multimedia computers with internet connectivity, <a>CBT</a>, CDs, e-books and e-journals to promote e-learning.</p>
<p>A library committee headed by the Principal, comprising of all the heads of departments and student representatives, meet every semester to discuss the functioning of the library.</p>
<p>The Training and Placement Cell helps get students placed in multinational companies (MNCs) and Indian Companies.

<p>The Entrepreneurship Development Cell was formed in 1996, and has organized awareness camps to motivate students to become entrepreneurs.
<p>The objective of the cell is to motivate and train students towards science and technology so that students <em>become job creators rather than job seekers</em>.</p>
<p>Since the campus is located  away from <a>Chennai</a> city, transportation is provided between <a>Chennai</a> city and the college.
The college started out with eight buses, and now runs over 65.

<p>The <a>Electrical and Electronics Engineering</a> , <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> , and Electronics and Communication Engineering departments have been recognized by <a>Anna University</a> as collaborative research centers for PhD degrees.
<a>R&amp;D</a> is aided by a <a>technology</a> <a>innovation</a> Center, which also houses <a>SPIC</a>'s research center.</p>
<h5>Forum For Economic Studies by Engineers</h5>
<p>The Forum For Economic Studies by Engineers <a>(FORESE)</a> () was created to equip engineering students with management skills and to help develop team management and interpersonal skills; to <em>nurture young professionals into tomorrows leaders</em>.</p>
<p>The first batch of students graduated in 1989.
The alumni of the institution have been placed in companies across the globe, and its students have completed Masters and PhDs from universities that include <a>Rutgers University</a>, <a>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>, <a>Georgia Tech</a>, <a>Virginia Tech</a>, <a>Harvard Medical School</a>, <a>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, <a>MIT</a>, <a>University of Texas at Austin</a>, <a>Stanford University</a>, <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a> and <a>University of Minnesota</a> .</p>
