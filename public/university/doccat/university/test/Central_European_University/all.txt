campus$$$@@@%%%<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>CEU was founded in 1991 in response to the fall of communism.
established$$$@@@%%%The founding vision was to create a university dedicated to examining the contemporary challenges of <a>open societies</a> and <a>democratization</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The initial aim was to create a Western-modeled yet distinctly Central European institution that would foster inter-regional cooperation and educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In its second decade, CEU broadened its focus from regional to global, with a special emphasis on <a>democratization</a> and <a>human rights</a> around the world.
established$$$@@@%%%CEU has since developed a distinct academic approach, combining regional studies with an international perspective, emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary research in order to generate new scholarship and policy initiatives, and to promote good governance and the rule of law.</p>
