The university is located in <a>Budapest</a>, and is accredited in the <a>United States</a> and in <a>Hungary</a>.</p>
<p>CEU has more than 1500 students from 100 countries and 300 faculty members from more than 30 countries.
In 2005, university co-founder <a>George Soros</a> announced he was doubling the CEU's endowment to <a>&#x20ac;</a>400 million .</p>
According to a study published by German newspaper <a>Die Zeit</a>, the CEU Department of <a>Political Science</a> is one of the best Political Science Departments in Europe.
However, its rank decreased from 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; place in 2006 to 39&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in 2009 in four years, although it climbed back to 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; place in 2010.</p>
<p>CEU was founded in 1991 in response to the fall of communism.
The founding vision was to create a university dedicated to examining the contemporary challenges of <a>open societies</a> and <a>democratization</a>.
The initial aim was to create a Western-modeled yet distinctly Central European institution that would foster inter-regional cooperation and educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region.</p>
<p>In its second decade, CEU broadened its focus from regional to global, with a special emphasis on <a>democratization</a> and <a>human rights</a> around the world.
CEU has since developed a distinct academic approach, combining regional studies with an international perspective, emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary research in order to generate new scholarship and policy initiatives, and to promote good governance and the rule of law.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

CEU been a pioneer in many fields: for example, it began the region's first master's degree programs in <a>gender studies</a> and <a>environmental sciences</a>.</p>
<p>CEU emphasizes the development of <a>open societies</a> in <a>Central and Eastern Europe</a> and the former Soviet Union by promoting a system of education in which ideas and policy initiatives are creatively, critically and comparatively examined and developed.
