Although founded to develop African-American Christian leadership, today more than half of its population is non-Catholic and 10 percent is non-black.</p>
<p>A premier university for educating African-American students in the sciences, Xavier regularly ranks first in the nation in placing African American students into medical school as well as first in awarding African Americans baccalaureate degrees in the physical sciences, the biological/life sciences, and physics.
The College of Pharmacy is one of just two pharmacy schools in Louisiana.
XULA ranks among the top three colleges in the nation in graduating African Americans with <a>Pharm.D.</a> degrees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Located in New Orleans, the small liberal arts college dates back to 1925, when <a>St.
Katharine Drexel</a> and the <a>Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a> founded the coeducational secondary school from which it evolved.
St. Katharine, supported by the interest of a substantial inheritance from her father, banker-financier <a>Francis Drexel</a>, founded and staffed many institution throughout the U.S. in an effort to help educate Native Americans and Blacks.</p>
<p>Aware of the serious lack of Catholic-oriented education available to young Blacks in the South, St. Katharine came to New Orleans and established a high school on the site previously occupied by <a>Southern University</a>.
The High School continues on today as <a>Xavier University Preparatory School</a>, known as Xavier Prep.
A Normal School, offering one of the few career fields (teaching) open to Blacks at the time, was added two years later.
In 1925 Xavier University became a reality when the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was established.
The first degrees were awarded three years later.
In 1927, a College of Pharmacy was opened.
<p>Recognizing the university's need for a separate identity and room to expand, St. Katharine bought a tract of undeveloped land for a campus on the corner of Palmetto and Pine Streets in 1929.
Construction of the U-shaped, gothic administration building (now a city landmark) was completed in 1933.
<p>Through the years, as needs dictated, the campus gradually filled out, with the addition of a library&#x2014;which now houses music&#x2014;in 1937, the gymnasium (1937), St. Michael's men's dormitory (1955), the Student Center (1962), women's dormitories: St. Joseph's (1965) and Katharine Drexel (1969), the House of Studies (1967); the College of Pharmacy (1970), the Norman C. Francis Academic/Science Complex (1988), the new Library/Resource Center and College of Pharmacy addition (1993), and Peter Claver women's dormitory (1994).
Xavier South, a multi-story office building, was purchased in 1990.
The Living Learning Center, a co-ed residence hall for upperclassmen and the Norman C. Francis science complex addition were completed in 1998.
A new student center called the University Center was opened in 2003.
It replaces the previous Student Center built in 1962, and now houses the bookstore (previously housed at Xavier South) &amp; the post office (previously housed in the Administration building).
An additional dormitory for upperclassmen, the Saint Martin Deporres hall was also opened in 2003.
The previous Student Center was recently knocked down to make way for the new Qatar Pharmacy Pavilion, which opened in the Fall of 2010.
The Chapel will replace the Chapel, now housed in the Administration Building, and will fulfill St. Katharine's vision for a freestanding house of worship and meditation on the campus.</p>
<p>The campus of Xavier University of Louisiana is often referred to as Emerald City, due to the various buildings on campus that have green roofs.
<p>The Sisters remain a vital presence on campus today, providing much-needed staffing and some financial assistance, but today Xavier is governed by a multicultural Board of Trustees.
<p>Even with its special mission to serve the Black, Catholic community Xavier's doors have always been open to qualified students of any race or creed.
In 2006, Obama (then a senator) addressed the graduating class at the first Commencement post-Katrina with his keynote speech.
He was also granted an honorary degree on behalf of the University.</p>
<p>Xavier is a member of the <a>National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) and the <a>Gulf Coast Athletic Conference</a> (GCAC).
