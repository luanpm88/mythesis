The school was founded in 1793, chartered as Hamilton College in 1812, and has been <a>coeducational</a> since 1978, when it merged with <a>Kirkland College</a>.</p>
<p>Hamilton is sometimes referred to as the &quot;College on the Hill&quot;, due to the school's location on top of College Hill, just outside of downtown Clinton.
Hamilton College is one of the &quot;<a>Little Ivies</a>,&quot; and is considered one of the nation's most prestigious liberal arts colleges.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hamilton began in 1793 as the <strong>Hamilton-Oneida Academy</strong>, a K-12 school, and was chartered as Hamilton College in 1812, making it the third oldest college established in New York, after <a>Columbia</a> and <a>Union</a>.
<a>Samuel Kirkland</a> founded the College as part of his missions work with the <a>Oneida tribe</a>.
The college is named for <a>Alexander Hamilton</a>, who was a member of the first Board of Trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy (though he never set foot on campus).
It was in fact <a>Baron von Steuben</a>, acting as Hamilton's surrogate, who laid the college's cornerstone.</p>
<p>In 1978, the all-male Hamilton College merged with the <a>all-female</a> <a>Kirkland College</a>, which had been located adjacent to and founded by Hamilton; the primary public reason for the merger was Kirkland's imminent insolvency.
It took nearly 7 years to fully complete the merger; female students were given the option of receiving a Kirkland diploma instead of a Hamilton diploma until 1979.
<p>Since the 1970s, Hamilton has been a member of the <a>New England Small College Athletic Conference</a> (or the NESCAC) (despite technically being located outside of New England).
<p>Today, the original Hamilton campus is referred to by students and some school literature as the &quot;light side&quot; or &quot;north side&quot; of the campus.
Formerly, the original side of campus was referred to as the &quot;Stryker Campus&quot; after its former president, <a>Melancthon Woolsey Stryker</a> (or incorrectly &quot;Striker Campus&quot;).
On the other side of College Hill Road, the original Kirkland campus is referred to affectionately as the &quot;dark side&quot; or as the &quot;south side.&quot;</p>
<p>Hamilton College president Joan Stewart and a small group of faculty members celebrated the establishment of  the Alexander Hamilton Center, an effort to promote the study of America's first treasury secretary with lectures and conferences, but the affiliation broke down over opposition from both the trustees and the overwhelming majority of faculty.
<p>During the summer of 2006, the school completed a 56 million dollar science building.
<p>The 700 seat hall hosts the College Orchestra conducted by <a>Heather Buchman</a>, Choir, Jazz Band, Oratorio Society, and Faculty Dance Concerts as well as guest artists from around the globe.</p>
<p>Hamilton College&#x2019;s Sage Rink is America's second oldest indoor collegiate hockey rink after Northeastern University's Matthews Arena.
It was financed by the widow of industrialist <a>Russell Sage</a>, whose name graces a number of Central New York college edifices, including <a>Russell Sage College</a>.
It was renovated in 1993, when it received better lighting, ice-making equipment, and structural enhancements.
The rink houses the college's Men's and Women's varsity hockey teams, intramural ice hockey, physical education classes, and local youth hockey games.</p>
<p>Completed in 1988, the pool was christened by a <a>Guinness Book of World Records</a> setting event in April 1989 when the world's longest swim relay was completed in the Bristol pool.</p>
<p>Home to the Hamilton College football team, Steuben Field was founded in 1897, and is one of the ten oldest collegiate football fields in the United States.
In Summer 2009, the field received a renovation that included the installation of FieldTurf and a new scoreboard.
The observatory burned down but is currently marked on campus by its telescope mount outside of the Sigma Phi Society house.
The existing observatory, located 100 feet from College Hill Road, was built with rock from the same quarry as the original building.</p>
<p>The college's chapel is a historically protected landmark and is the only three story chapel still standing in America.
The chapel is topped by a signature <a>quill pen</a> <a>weather vane</a>, which represents Hamilton College's long standing commitment to producing graduates with exceptional writing and communication abilities.</p>
<p>The cottage was the original residence of Samuel Kirkland when he began his missionary work to the Oneida that resulted in the founding of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy.
The cottage itself is completely original, although it was moved from its original location on Kirkland's property (known today as <a>Harding Farm</a>) to its current place on the main quadrangle of the Hamilton Side.

Through Oren Root&#x2019;s marriage to a daughter of Horatio Buttrick, the building became the birthplace of Elihu Root, U.S. secretary of state and recipient of the 1912 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a>.
The house currently serves as office space for the President of the College and the Dean of Faculty.</p>

<p><strong>Citrus Bowl</strong>: The Citrus Bowl is the first men's home hockey game of the season.
Traditionally the game was called the Orange Bowl, and upon the first Hamilton-scored goal, oranges that students had smuggled into the rink were thrown onto the ice at the visiting goalie.
This often resulted in a delay-of-game penalty against Hamilton while the ice was cleaned.
