<p><em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> reported: </p>
It is the practice of Pensacola Christian College, and other colleges and universities, to accept or reject credits based on their own institutional criteria regardless of whether or not that particular school transferring credit is accredited.&quot;
<p><em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> found that many Christian colleges and some secular institutions accept Pensacola's credits.
<p>PCC also states that they believe the <a>Textus Receptus</a> is the superior Greek text of the Bible and upon this basis use the <a>King James version</a> of the Bible for all their pulpit ministry and classroom Bible instruction.
<p>PCC senior Communicative Arts students and graduate students are required for part of their course work to perform in either a concert or recital according to their concentration.
Although nearly all students acquire demerits at one time or another, historically one-third of the PCC students do not accumulate enough demerits (over 15) to be retained on their records.
Why is this the case?
PCC however holds that as an independent church they have the right to operate the Campus Church according to their interpretation of what is scriptural.</p>
