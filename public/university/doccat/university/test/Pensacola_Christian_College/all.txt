established$$$@@@%%%<p> <strong>Pensacola Christian College</strong> (PCC) is an <a>unaccredited</a>, <a>fundamentalist</a>, <a>Independent Baptist</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>, USA, founded in 1974 by <a>Arlin Horton</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%Arlin and Beka Horton moved to <a>Pensacola, Florida</a> in 1952 to found a Christian grade school.
established$$$@@@%%%That school, Pensacola Christian School, opened in 1954.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1974, the Hortons opened Pensacola Christian College to further their vision of &quot;Education from a Christian Perspective.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Pensacola Theological Seminary, an extension of PCC's graduate school, was founded in 1998.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>The school's 4,000+ <a>undergraduate</a> students represent all 50 states and over 60 nations.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school is an active proponent of traditional, <a>Christian education</a>; their in-house publisher, <em>A Beka Book</em> (named after Horton's wife, Beka), provides a <a>K-12</a> curriculum that is used by some traditional <a>Christian</a> schools and <a>homeschooling</a> families.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%It has become one of the largest Christian textbook publishers in America.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2005 more than 3,500 delegates attended practical clinics and seminars sponsored by the college.
established$$$@@@%%%The Principal's Clinic provides administrators and teachers with materials, methods, and principles for starting and building a traditional <a>Christian school</a>.
faculty$$$@@@%%%They also hold a Summer Seminar that provides faculty and administrators with an in-depth orientation into their perspective on how a Christian school should be operated.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academics</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pensacola Christian College's statement of purpose is: <em>Pensacola Christian College was founded with the purpose of training young men and women for a life of service to <a>Jesus</a> <a>Christ</a>.</em></p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Undergraduate programs</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC offers over sixty undergraduate programs of study.
nickname$$$@@@%%%These programs fall under the oversight of eight academic divisions including the Division of Bible, the Division of Business, the Division of Education, the Division of Communicative Arts, the Division of Music, the Division of Arts and Sciences, the Division of Basic Sciences and Engineering, and the Division of Nursing.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Graduate programs</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Graduate degrees are offered through the Graduate school at PCC and through Pensacola Theological Seminary in the fields of Bible, Education, Music, Communicative Arts, Divinity, Ministry, Nursing, and Business Administration.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Accreditation</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pensacola Christian College is <a>not institutionally accredited</a> by any of the recognized accreditation bodies in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%In numerous publications, including its college catalog, the school explains it eschews accreditation.
established$$$@@@%%%The school indicates an outside agency that doesn't share its religious and moral distinctives may try to pressure the school to change or eliminate its beliefs.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>Notwithstanding its lack of formal accreditation, PCC's nursing program is approved by the Florida State Board of Nursing, and graduates are eligible to apply for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) in all 50 states and U.S. territories.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p><em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> reported: </p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>As PCC is not <a>accredited</a>, PCC graduates may have difficulty pursuing a graduate degree or getting employment where an accredited degree is required.
country$$$@@@%%%This is not due to a lack of accreditation bodies, as there are at least three bodies recognized by the <a>United States Department of Education</a> that accredit religious colleges.
nickname$$$@@@%%%All students at PCC are required to sign a statement that they understand that &quot;Pensacola Christian College has never made application for regional accreditation because the College believes it could jeopardize the College's philosophical distinctive.
type$$$@@@%%%It is the practice of Pensacola Christian College, and other colleges and universities, to accept or reject credits based on their own institutional criteria regardless of whether or not that particular school transferring credit is accredited.&quot;
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p><em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> found that many Christian colleges and some secular institutions accept Pensacola's credits.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>&quot;...the success of our graduates demonstrates PCC's excellent quality of education.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Their credits have been accepted by over 700 colleges and universities, including over 375 accredited graduate schools, 72 <a>medical school</a>s and 66 <a>law school</a>s.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>This reputation for excellence is also based on each student's academic achievement as he [or she] seeks to transfer to other institutions or admission to graduate schools.
image_size$$$@@@%%%PCC graduates further demonstrate academic excellence by being accepted to and successfully studying at some of he most prestigious accredited Graduate schools in America.&quot;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Philosophical position</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In accordance with their position on the Bible, the Genesis creation account is the foundation from which all study of origins is taught, specifically PCC teaches <a>young Earth creationism</a> and <a>flood geology</a>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Students are taught that God created the earth in six literal 24 hour days.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Chemical, cosmic, stellar and planetary, organic, and macro-evolution are presented as un-observed, albeit popular, evolutionary theory, but micro-evolution (i.e.
mascot$$$@@@%%%variations within kinds) is presented as observed science.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Archeology</a> is taught from a Biblical timeline and perspective, following the <a>Ussher chronology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Taking a firm stand against  <a>Freudian</a> psychological principles, PCC instead teaches psychology and counseling based on teachings from the Bible, with the Bible being the source of help for non-organic psychological problems.
established$$$@@@%%%The Nursing program, however, includes a six credit course titled &quot;Psychology and Mental Health Nursing&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Articles of faith</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC's articles of faith reject the teachings of <a>Calvinism</a>, <a>Modernism</a>, <a>Neo-orthodoxy</a> and the modern day <a>charismatic movement</a>.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%PCC specifically states that &quot;[w]ithout meaning to be unfriendly or unkind, we feel it only fair to say that [PCC] is not a part of the 'tongues movement' and does not allow students to participate in or promote any charismatic activities.&quot;</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC also states that they believe the <a>Textus Receptus</a> is the superior Greek text of the Bible and upon this basis use the <a>King James version</a> of the Bible for all their pulpit ministry and classroom Bible instruction.

website$$$@@@%%%<h3>Fine Arts Series</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Every year the college invites well known performers unaffiliated with PCC to put on productions and performances in either the Dale Horton Auditorium or the Crowne Centre on the campus of PCC.
established$$$@@@%%%Prominent artists that have performed at PCC include the late <a>Jerome Hines</a> of the <a>New York Metropolitan Opera</a>, the <a>Atlantic Brass Quintet</a>, <a>Christopher Parkening</a>, the <a>Vienna Boys' Choir</a>, <a>Anthony Kearns</a> of <em>The Irish Tenors</em>, and the <a>Gregg Smith Singers</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Every semester the staff and students of PCC also put on plays and operas which in the past have included <a>Shakespearean</a> plays and <a>Gilbert and Sullivan</a> musicals.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Student attendance is mandatory.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Concert and Recital Series and plays</h3>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC senior Communicative Arts students and graduate students are required for part of their course work to perform in either a concert or recital according to their concentration.
nickname$$$@@@%%%These concerts and recitals are open to the public, and provide opportunities for PCC students to experience musical and dramatic productions.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to these concerts and recitals the Dramatic Arts department puts on small plays in the experimental theater located in the Communicative Arts building.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to the grassroots nature of these plays, directed and performed by PCC Speech and Dramatic Arts students, these productions generally sell out for every performance and many students consider them a highlight of the semester.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Collegians</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>All PCC students are required to participate in on campus societies called Collegians.
established$$$@@@%%%Every fall semester the PCC Collegians hold Greek Rush which includes a parade of every collegian through campus and provides collegians the opportunity to recruit new members from the incoming freshman class.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%All collegians are identified by a series of three Greek letters.
established$$$@@@%%%All men's collegians end with the Greek letter Delta &quot;&#x0394;&quot; and all women's collegians end with the Greek letter Rho &quot;&#x03a1;&quot;. Collegians provide opportunities for PCC students to hone leadership skills, to serve in on-campus capacities, provides opportunities for off-campus group excursions and provide a venue for on-campus activities including intramural sports.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Collegians meet Wednesday mornings twice monthly.</p>
website$$$@@@%%%<h3>On campus sporting events</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC participates in the <a>National Christian College Athletic Association</a> (NCCAA) for intercollegiate sports.
established$$$@@@%%%The Mens Eagles Basketball games as well as the Lady Eagles basketball games played in the Arena level of the Sports Center provide a great deal of excitement for PCC students during the basketball season.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The Lady Eagles Volleyball team also competes at the intercollegiate level.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to intercollegiate athletics, PCC students are also afforded the opportunity to play intramural sports through their Collegians.
free$$$@@@%%%Collegian sports are known for intense team rivalries and expressions of team spirit.
city$$$@@@%%%Sports offered through collegians include Soccer, basketball, softball, volleyball, and broom-hockey among others.
established$$$@@@%%%Every fall Collegian Soccer culminates with the winners of the playoffs facing each other in the annual Turkey Bowl held over the Thanksgiving weekend.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In the spring students enjoy softball and basketball which provided athletic opportunities to PCC students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC also hosts a number of invitational high school sporting tournaments and camps.</p>
affiliation$$$@@@%%%<h3>Free time recreation</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The campus of PCC offers opportunities for non-organized individual or group recreation during free time.
free_label$$$@@@%%%A highlight of on campus activity is the on campus Sport Center recently renamed in honor of the president; the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center.
free_label$$$@@@%%%On the lower level of the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center, students can ice-skate, bowl at PCC's 12-lane bowling alley, play racquetball, play miniature golf, play table tennis, or work out in one of the weight rooms.
free_label$$$@@@%%%A new expansion to the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center called the Sports Center Annex was completed and opened in the fall of 2009.
established$$$@@@%%%This new annex features a full indoor water park equipped with water slides that range in length from  to , a Double Flow Rider surfing wave, a 500 gallon dump bucket and water cannons.
free_label$$$@@@%%%In addition the new annex includes a  inline skating track, additional racquetball courts, fitness rooms, a roof top sun deck, &quot;The Hut&quot; a snack bar for participant refreshment, and the largest indoor climbing wall in the nation boasting a   tall climbing wall with 3000 artificial hand holds as well as natural cracks and crevices.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Also available on campus is the John Ray Hall Field House in which students can play basketball, swim in the Swim Center, work out in the weight room, and play tennis in the tennis courts.
established$$$@@@%%%On east field students can utilize outdoor basketball courts, a soccer field, an eight lane running track, softball fields, and additional tennis courts.
free_label$$$@@@%%%There is also an indoor running track in the upper level of the Sports Center.
mascot$$$@@@%%%In addition, students willing to make the 30-minute drive can enjoy West Campus, where students can sail in catamarans or go kayaking.
mascot$$$@@@%%%There are designated times during which men and women may use the facilities at the waterpark, swim center, and West Campus.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h3>On campus work assistance program</h3>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC students who would otherwise not be able to afford a college education are given the opportunity to work on campus through PCC's Work Assistance program.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Unlike in a typical workplace, students are assigned jobs rather than interviewing for them.
staff$$$@@@%%%Through work assistance students can maintain a part-time job on campus in a number of areas including security, print-shop, housekeeping, dining/food service, grounds and facilities.
mascot$$$@@@%%%A Beka Book's workforce is composed mostly of PCC students whose wages are transferred to their college accounts.
faculty$$$@@@%%%There is an available cash worker program; workers in this program have their earnings direct deposited to their bank account.
country$$$@@@%%%However, priority for employment is given to those in the work assistance program.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Foreign students are not offered/assigned a job in the Work Assistance program.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>For students who choose to do so, PCC also offers a specialized work assistance program whereby students can sign a contract to work on campus for a five-year period while taking classes.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Upon completion of their contract these students graduate from PCC completely debt free.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The work assistance program also provides a means for PCC to keep their costs down because, instead of hiring full-time staff to run the day to day operations of the campus, under the supervision of qualified staff the campus is largely run and maintained by PCC students.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Rules and regulations</h3>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC is open about its strict policies regarding student conduct.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%The school sends a booklet to students before they arrive every year, titled &quot;Things To Know Before You Arrive.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%The basics of the school's policies and philosophies are laid out for students and parents to review before traveling to the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college maintains, &quot;attendance at PCC is a privilege not a right.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%This phrase is printed in all of PCC's administration and registration publications including course catalogs, student handbooks, and information sent out to prospective students regarding attendance at PCC.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Regulations govern many aspects of the residence hall students' lives, including dress, hairstyles, cleanliness of residence hall rooms, styles of music (PCC only permits its students to listen to <a>classical music</a>, traditional <a>Christian music</a> or Sacred music), borrowing, off-campus employment, and internet access.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<p>PCC also has strict policies regarding mixed-gender interaction.
free$$$@@@%%%Physical contact between members of the opposite sex is only permitted under very limited circumstances.
established$$$@@@%%%Written permission of the dean&#x2019;s office must be procured for all off-campus meetings between members of the opposite sex.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In addition, all mixed-gender meetings (on and off-campus), must have a PCC <a>chaperone</a> present.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Demerits and punishments</h3>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>At the beginning of each semester students are required to sign a waiver stating that they understand &quot;attendance at PCC is a privilege not a right&quot; and that they therefore agree to abide by all regulations and guidelines set forth by the college.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Students who are found to be in violation of this signed agreement are subject to administrative review by the Discipline Committee (members of the college administration selected to review alleged infractions of college policies), during which demerits are assigned or canceled corresponding to the degree of the infraction or circumstantial conditions surrounding the incident in question.
type$$$@@@%%%Although nearly all students acquire demerits at one time or another, historically one-third of the PCC students do not accumulate enough demerits (over 15) to be retained on their records.
students$$$@@@%%%As a result, one-third of PCC student records reflect 0 demerits per semester, and most other PCC students records contain a very minimal number of demerits.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>For students who do acquire demerits, PCC has three levels of <a>punishment</a>; students can be &quot;socialed&quot;, &quot;shadowed&quot;, or <a>expelled</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>PCC prohibits physical contact of any kind between members of the opposite sex.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Students caught violating this prohibition are subject to being <strong>socialed</strong>. Students who have been socialed are not permitted to speak or interact with members of the opposite sex for a period ranging from one day to four weeks, depending on the severity of the offense.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Students who are found with the opposite sex anywhere on campus deemed to be a unchaperoned area after 6 pm can be subject to being socialed as well.</li>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<li>Upon suspicion by the Dean's office that a student is in great violation of college policy, that student may be subject to being <strong>shadowed</strong>. Individuals who are shadowed are assigned to a Floor Leader (a fellow student who is selected by PCC to provide leadership in the residence hall and to enforce college regulations) and must remain with the Floor Leader at all times.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%This includes being required to attend the Floor Leader's classes and moving to the Floor Leader's room.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Furthermore, any one student is able to write up another student, but does not necessarily mean that they are giving them demerits.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The Student Voice, a website designed to discuss such concerns about PCC, says, &quot;It is also inherently unfair to sanction a student for something when the individual doing the sanctioning is unknown.
nickname$$$@@@%%%What check is there against prejudicial charges?
mascot$$$@@@%%%If anyone believes that prejudice is not present at PCC, they are very naive.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%[...] The process arbitrarily takes one person's word over another's.
type$$$@@@%%%Why is this the case?
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Why is it that if you accuse another student of something, you automatically receive the benefit of the doubt over the accused simply because you have made an accusation?
image_name$$$@@@%%%[...]
affiliations$$$@@@%%%There are a multitude of reasons why one person's word may not be accurate: prejudice, incorrect perception of surrounding circumstances, incorrect information, etc.&quot;
country$$$@@@%%%However, whether true or not, when a student without the authority of being a student manager, security, or a floor leader writes another student up, it rarely results in a student getting in trouble.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Depending on the severity of the supposed rule violation will depend on whether or not the matter is actually looked into.
students$$$@@@%%%In addition, falsely accusing a fellow student of anything constitutes one of the highest violations of the campus rules.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Controversies involving PCC</h2>
city$$$@@@%%%<h3>King-James-only debate</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pensacola Christian College considers the Greek <a>Textus Receptus</a>, from which the King James New Testament is translated, to be superior to other available New Testament texts, and therefore supports the exclusive use of translations based on this text.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1996, Dell Johnson, who would later become the dean of <a>Pensacola Theological Seminary</a>, gave two chapel messages advocating the exclusive use of the <a>King James Bible</a> and the Received Greek text.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1997, the school released a video featuring Johnson, Michael Bates, and the late Theodore P. Letis entitled &quot;The Text Is The Issue.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The following year, Letis and Johnson presented a history of textual criticism in American Bible seminaries, blaming <a>Benjamin B. Warfield</a> and his followers including A.T. Robertson in the <a>Southern Baptist Convention</a>, <a>Lewis Sperry Chafer</a> at <a>Dallas Theological Seminary</a>, and Charles Brokenshire at <a>Bob Jones University</a> for what they considered undesirable changes.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the end of the video, Johnson denounced certain King James Only advocates such as <a>Jack Hyles</a>, <a>Peter Ruckman</a>, and William Grady, who espouse &quot;advanced revelation&quot; or &quot;re-inspiration&quot; views of the <a>King James Version of the Bible</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Dell Johnson has since left Pensacola Christian and its affiliates.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Politics, taxation and religion</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school has an active Anti-&quot;Tax Rebel&quot; stand and will report anyone who they feel is breaking the tax laws of the country.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%They will also prevent any student from associating with anyone they feel has an anti-taxation stance.</p>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>Senior vice president Rebekah Horton feels that it is her duty to report anyone she feels is breaking tax law.
established$$$@@@%%%In the mid 1990s, after she learned of <a>Kent Hovind</a>'s anti-tax stand said &quot;'We know the Scriptures do not promote (tax evasion),'&quot; during testimony against Hovind during his 2006 trial, &quot;'It's against Scripture teaching'.... Horton believed it was the college's duty to report the misleading doctrine.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%'I didn't want to see innocent people get led astray,' she said.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%Pensacola Christian College no longer permitted its students to work at Creation Science Evangelism&quot;.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<h3><em>The Student Voice</em></h3>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1996 one particular PCC alumnus started an electronic newsletter entitled <em>The Student Voice</em>.
head_label$$$@@@%%%This newsletter voiced opposition to various rules and policies of the college.
established$$$@@@%%%During this time <em>The Student Voice</em> also bought out advertising space on a large <a>billboard</a> adjacent to the campus of PCC to advertise its website.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. Arlin Horton and the administration of PCC responded to the newspaper's first issue with a speech in the campus chapel, calling the newspaper &quot;an attack from <a>Satan</a>&quot;,  reminding students that when they registered for enrollment at PCC they agreed to follow all rules and regulations of the college, that they were not forced to attend the school, and that anyone involved with the newspaper would be subject to expulsion.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The following semester PCC banned all devices which would allow an individual to connect a personal computer to the Internet.<em>The
mascot$$$@@@%%%Student Voice</em> released new issues regularly for two years and continued to release their newsletter irregularly through their website until 2003.
nickname$$$@@@%%%According to former students, <em>The Student Voice</em> was not the sole reason for loss of Internet access at PCC.
staff$$$@@@%%%These former students have stated that the same year a ring of students were intercepted while involved in surfing Internet pornography.
established$$$@@@%%%Internet access on the campus of PCC was severely limited until the summer of 2004 when a new <a>filter</a>ed wireless Internet service run by the college became available to all students on campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Other ministries of PCC</h2>
state$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Campus Church</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Pensacola Christian College, hosts a &quot;local church&quot; in the main auditorium on campus, The Crowne Centre, called the Campus Church.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Most PCC students are required to attend the Campus Church, which PCC feels is an integral part of each student's spiritual growth.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On December 10, 2006, Dr. Arlin Horton announced that Dr. Neal Jackson would be the pastor of the Campus Church.
staff$$$@@@%%%Dr. Jackson received his Bachelor of Arts degree and Master of Arts degree from PCC.
established$$$@@@%%%He also has a Doctor of Ministry Degree from <a>Luther Rice Seminary</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The position of Pastor of the Campus Church had previously been held by Jim Schettler who resigned that position in May, 2006.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since the inception of PCC and of the Campus Church, critics have pointed out that college's Campus Church may not be a true local church.
established$$$@@@%%%One example of how the Campus Church operates differently is the recent selection of its current pastors.
established$$$@@@%%%Traditionally, local churches of the Independent Baptist persuasion (as the Campus Church claims to be) form a pulpit committee which presents pastoral candidates to the congregation for a yes or no vote.
established$$$@@@%%%Upon a majority yes vote of the congregation a call is extended to the candidate to become the church's pastor.
established$$$@@@%%%In the case of Dr. Neal Jackson and Dr. Lloyd Streeter becoming the Campus Church co-pastor in January 2007, Arlin Horton personally selected them without either a pulpit committee or congregational vote.
type$$$@@@%%%PCC however holds that as an independent church they have the right to operate the Campus Church according to their interpretation of what is scriptural.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>However, as of August 20, 2009, Dr. Neal Jackson resigned his position as Pastor of the Campus Church.
president$$$@@@%%%Below is his resignation speech: </p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Rejoice in the Lord</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Campus Church of Pensacola Christian College records its Sunday services for weekly television broadcast of <em><a>Rejoice in the Lord</a></em>.
established$$$@@@%%%The programming of <em>Rejoice in the Lord</em> consists of musical numbers performed by the Rejoice Choir, various PCC musical ensemble groups, congregational singing recorded in the Campus Church and preaching by Dr.Joel Mullenix,current interim pastor.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%WPCS is the main station of the <strong>Rejoice Broadcasting Network</strong> (sometimes referred to as &quot;RBN&quot;).
established$$$@@@%%%The content heard on Rejoice Radio consists primarily of inspirational music and syndicated Christian radio programming.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>A Beka Book</h3>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>A Beka Book</strong> is a <a>publisher</a> affiliated with Pensacola Christian College that produces K-12 <a>curriculum</a> materials that are used by <a>Conservative Christian</a> schools and <a>homeschooling</a> families around the world.
established$$$@@@%%%It is named after Rebekah Horton, wife of college president <a>Arlin Horton</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%A Beka Book and <a>Bob Jones University Press</a>  are considered the two major publishers of Christian-based educational materials in America.
country$$$@@@%%%A Beka Book is the largest Christian textbook publisher in the world.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A Beka Book has been criticized by the <a>University of California</a> and <a>National Center for Science Education</a> for publishing information contrary to accepted historical consensus, scientific consensus, especially regarding the <a>theory of evolution</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A Beka Book takes a firm <a>Biblical literalist</a> and <a>young earth creationist</a> positions in its science curriculum, portraying the <a>Genesis creation narrative</a> as a fact, which go <a>against scientific consensus</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In particular, A Beka Book was criticized for selling works that are contradictory to the scientific consensus regarding the <a>origins of the universe</a>, <a>origins of life</a>, and <a>evolution</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In <a>Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Roman Stearns et al.</a>, a judge upheld the <a>University of California</a>'s rejection of A Beka publications for preparatory use because the books are &quot;inconsistent with the viewpoints and knowledge generally accepted in the <a>scientific community</a>.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>For a short period A Beka Book held <a>tax exempt</a> status because its profits were channeled into PCC as a tax exempt religious organization or educational institution.
established$$$@@@%%%In January 1995 the <a>U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a> ruled that the college's publishing arm was liable for taxes as a profit-making entity.
established$$$@@@%%%The IRS further ruled that since the profits of the publishing arm benefited the organization as a whole due to the fact that both A Beka Book and PCC were run under the same organization and that all of the profits of A Beka Book went directly to PCC constituting 60% of the college's income.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The effect of this ruling rendered the publishing company ineligible for future tax exempt status.
established$$$@@@%%%Although PCC was ultimately cleared of any liability for back taxes, PCC paid the estimated at $44.5 million, and A Beka Book paid another $3.5 million dollars.</p>
