<p> <strong>Pensacola Christian College</strong> (PCC) is an <a>unaccredited</a>, <a>fundamentalist</a>, <a>Independent Baptist</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>, USA, founded in 1974 by <a>Arlin Horton</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
Arlin and Beka Horton moved to <a>Pensacola, Florida</a> in 1952 to found a Christian grade school.
That school, Pensacola Christian School, opened in 1954.</p>
<p>In 1974, the Hortons opened Pensacola Christian College to further their vision of &quot;Education from a Christian Perspective.&quot;
Pensacola Theological Seminary, an extension of PCC's graduate school, was founded in 1998.</p>
<p>The school is an active proponent of traditional, <a>Christian education</a>; their in-house publisher, <em>A Beka Book</em> (named after Horton's wife, Beka), provides a <a>K-12</a> curriculum that is used by some traditional <a>Christian</a> schools and <a>homeschooling</a> families.
<p>In 2005 more than 3,500 delegates attended practical clinics and seminars sponsored by the college.
The Principal's Clinic provides administrators and teachers with materials, methods, and principles for starting and building a traditional <a>Christian school</a>.
<p>Pensacola Christian College's statement of purpose is: <em>Pensacola Christian College was founded with the purpose of training young men and women for a life of service to <a>Jesus</a> <a>Christ</a>.</em></p>
<p>Pensacola Christian College is <a>not institutionally accredited</a> by any of the recognized accreditation bodies in the United States.
In numerous publications, including its college catalog, the school explains it eschews accreditation.
The school indicates an outside agency that doesn't share its religious and moral distinctives may try to pressure the school to change or eliminate its beliefs.</p>
<p>&quot;...the success of our graduates demonstrates PCC's excellent quality of education.
<p>In accordance with their position on the Bible, the Genesis creation account is the foundation from which all study of origins is taught, specifically PCC teaches <a>young Earth creationism</a> and <a>flood geology</a>.
<a>Archeology</a> is taught from a Biblical timeline and perspective, following the <a>Ussher chronology</a>.
Taking a firm stand against  <a>Freudian</a> psychological principles, PCC instead teaches psychology and counseling based on teachings from the Bible, with the Bible being the source of help for non-organic psychological problems.
The Nursing program, however, includes a six credit course titled &quot;Psychology and Mental Health Nursing&quot;.</p>
<h2>Articles of faith</h2>
<p>PCC's articles of faith reject the teachings of <a>Calvinism</a>, <a>Modernism</a>, <a>Neo-orthodoxy</a> and the modern day <a>charismatic movement</a>.
Prominent artists that have performed at PCC include the late <a>Jerome Hines</a> of the <a>New York Metropolitan Opera</a>, the <a>Atlantic Brass Quintet</a>, <a>Christopher Parkening</a>, the <a>Vienna Boys' Choir</a>, <a>Anthony Kearns</a> of <em>The Irish Tenors</em>, and the <a>Gregg Smith Singers</a>.
Every semester the staff and students of PCC also put on plays and operas which in the past have included <a>Shakespearean</a> plays and <a>Gilbert and Sullivan</a> musicals.
Due to the grassroots nature of these plays, directed and performed by PCC Speech and Dramatic Arts students, these productions generally sell out for every performance and many students consider them a highlight of the semester.</p>
Every fall semester the PCC Collegians hold Greek Rush which includes a parade of every collegian through campus and provides collegians the opportunity to recruit new members from the incoming freshman class.
All men's collegians end with the Greek letter Delta &quot;&#x0394;&quot; and all women's collegians end with the Greek letter Rho &quot;&#x03a1;&quot;. Collegians provide opportunities for PCC students to hone leadership skills, to serve in on-campus capacities, provides opportunities for off-campus group excursions and provide a venue for on-campus activities including intramural sports.
The Mens Eagles Basketball games as well as the Lady Eagles basketball games played in the Arena level of the Sports Center provide a great deal of excitement for PCC students during the basketball season.
Every fall Collegian Soccer culminates with the winners of the playoffs facing each other in the annual Turkey Bowl held over the Thanksgiving weekend.
<p>PCC also hosts a number of invitational high school sporting tournaments and camps.</p>
<p>The campus of PCC offers opportunities for non-organized individual or group recreation during free time.
This new annex features a full indoor water park equipped with water slides that range in length from  to , a Double Flow Rider surfing wave, a 500 gallon dump bucket and water cannons.
<p>Also available on campus is the John Ray Hall Field House in which students can play basketball, swim in the Swim Center, work out in the weight room, and play tennis in the tennis courts.
On east field students can utilize outdoor basketball courts, a soccer field, an eight lane running track, softball fields, and additional tennis courts.
<p>For students who choose to do so, PCC also offers a specialized work assistance program whereby students can sign a contract to work on campus for a five-year period while taking classes.
<p>The college maintains, &quot;attendance at PCC is a privilege not a right.&quot;
<p>Regulations govern many aspects of the residence hall students' lives, including dress, hairstyles, cleanliness of residence hall rooms, styles of music (PCC only permits its students to listen to <a>classical music</a>, traditional <a>Christian music</a> or Sacred music), borrowing, off-campus employment, and internet access.</p>
Written permission of the dean&#x2019;s office must be procured for all off-campus meetings between members of the opposite sex.
<li>PCC prohibits physical contact of any kind between members of the opposite sex.

<li><a>Cathy McMorris Rodgers</a> - elected to <a>United States House of Representatives</a> from <a>Washington</a> state</li>
<li>Esther Slater McDonald&nbsp;&#x2014; Former Counsel to the Associate Attorney General for the <a>United States Department of Justice</a>, implicated by the <a>DOJ Inspector General</a> in the controversial <a>2006 dismissal of U.S. attorneys</a>  Later exonerated.</li>

<p>Pensacola Christian College considers the Greek <a>Textus Receptus</a>, from which the King James New Testament is translated, to be superior to other available New Testament texts, and therefore supports the exclusive use of translations based on this text.</p>
<p>In 1996, Dell Johnson, who would later become the dean of <a>Pensacola Theological Seminary</a>, gave two chapel messages advocating the exclusive use of the <a>King James Bible</a> and the Received Greek text.
In 1997, the school released a video featuring Johnson, Michael Bates, and the late Theodore P. Letis entitled &quot;The Text Is The Issue.&quot;
The following year, Letis and Johnson presented a history of textual criticism in American Bible seminaries, blaming <a>Benjamin B. Warfield</a> and his followers including A.T. Robertson in the <a>Southern Baptist Convention</a>, <a>Lewis Sperry Chafer</a> at <a>Dallas Theological Seminary</a>, and Charles Brokenshire at <a>Bob Jones University</a> for what they considered undesirable changes.</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Johnson denounced certain King James Only advocates such as <a>Jack Hyles</a>, <a>Peter Ruckman</a>, and William Grady, who espouse &quot;advanced revelation&quot; or &quot;re-inspiration&quot; views of the <a>King James Version of the Bible</a>.
Dell Johnson has since left Pensacola Christian and its affiliates.</p>
<p>The school has an active Anti-&quot;Tax Rebel&quot; stand and will report anyone who they feel is breaking the tax laws of the country.
In the mid 1990s, after she learned of <a>Kent Hovind</a>'s anti-tax stand said &quot;'We know the Scriptures do not promote (tax evasion),'&quot; during testimony against Hovind during his 2006 trial, &quot;'It's against Scripture teaching'.... Horton believed it was the college's duty to report the misleading doctrine.
During this time <em>The Student Voice</em> also bought out advertising space on a large <a>billboard</a> adjacent to the campus of PCC to advertise its website.
Dr. Arlin Horton and the administration of PCC responded to the newspaper's first issue with a speech in the campus chapel, calling the newspaper &quot;an attack from <a>Satan</a>&quot;,  reminding students that when they registered for enrollment at PCC they agreed to follow all rules and regulations of the college, that they were not forced to attend the school, and that anyone involved with the newspaper would be subject to expulsion.
Internet access on the campus of PCC was severely limited until the summer of 2004 when a new <a>filter</a>ed wireless Internet service run by the college became available to all students on campus.</p>
<h2>Other ministries of PCC</h2>
<p>On December 10, 2006, Dr. Arlin Horton announced that Dr. Neal Jackson would be the pastor of the Campus Church.
He also has a Doctor of Ministry Degree from <a>Luther Rice Seminary</a>.
The position of Pastor of the Campus Church had previously been held by Jim Schettler who resigned that position in May, 2006.</p>
<p>Since the inception of PCC and of the Campus Church, critics have pointed out that college's Campus Church may not be a true local church.
One example of how the Campus Church operates differently is the recent selection of its current pastors.
Traditionally, local churches of the Independent Baptist persuasion (as the Campus Church claims to be) form a pulpit committee which presents pastoral candidates to the congregation for a yes or no vote.
Upon a majority yes vote of the congregation a call is extended to the candidate to become the church's pastor.
In the case of Dr. Neal Jackson and Dr. Lloyd Streeter becoming the Campus Church co-pastor in January 2007, Arlin Horton personally selected them without either a pulpit committee or congregational vote.
<h3>Rejoice in the Lord</h3>
<p>The Campus Church of Pensacola Christian College records its Sunday services for weekly television broadcast of <em><a>Rejoice in the Lord</a></em>.
The programming of <em>Rejoice in the Lord</em> consists of musical numbers performed by the Rejoice Choir, various PCC musical ensemble groups, congregational singing recorded in the Campus Church and preaching by Dr.Joel Mullenix,current interim pastor.</p>
WPCS is the main station of the <strong>Rejoice Broadcasting Network</strong> (sometimes referred to as &quot;RBN&quot;).
The content heard on Rejoice Radio consists primarily of inspirational music and syndicated Christian radio programming.</p>
<p><strong>A Beka Book</strong> is a <a>publisher</a> affiliated with Pensacola Christian College that produces K-12 <a>curriculum</a> materials that are used by <a>Conservative Christian</a> schools and <a>homeschooling</a> families around the world.
It is named after Rebekah Horton, wife of college president <a>Arlin Horton</a>.
<p>A Beka Book has been criticized by the <a>University of California</a> and <a>National Center for Science Education</a> for publishing information contrary to accepted historical consensus, scientific consensus, especially regarding the <a>theory of evolution</a>.
A Beka Book takes a firm <a>Biblical literalist</a> and <a>young earth creationist</a> positions in its science curriculum, portraying the <a>Genesis creation narrative</a> as a fact, which go <a>against scientific consensus</a>.
In particular, A Beka Book was criticized for selling works that are contradictory to the scientific consensus regarding the <a>origins of the universe</a>, <a>origins of life</a>, and <a>evolution</a>.
<p>For a short period A Beka Book held <a>tax exempt</a> status because its profits were channeled into PCC as a tax exempt religious organization or educational institution.
In January 1995 the <a>U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a> ruled that the college's publishing arm was liable for taxes as a profit-making entity.
The IRS further ruled that since the profits of the publishing arm benefited the organization as a whole due to the fact that both A Beka Book and PCC were run under the same organization and that all of the profits of A Beka Book went directly to PCC constituting 60% of the college's income.
Although PCC was ultimately cleared of any liability for back taxes, PCC paid the estimated at $44.5 million, and A Beka Book paid another $3.5 million dollars.</p>
