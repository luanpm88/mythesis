<p>In addition to intercollegiate athletics, PCC students are also afforded the opportunity to play intramural sports through their Collegians.
A highlight of on campus activity is the on campus Sport Center recently renamed in honor of the president; the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center.
On the lower level of the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center, students can ice-skate, bowl at PCC's 12-lane bowling alley, play racquetball, play miniature golf, play table tennis, or work out in one of the weight rooms.
A new expansion to the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center called the Sports Center Annex was completed and opened in the fall of 2009.
In addition the new annex includes a  inline skating track, additional racquetball courts, fitness rooms, a roof top sun deck, &quot;The Hut&quot; a snack bar for participant refreshment, and the largest indoor climbing wall in the nation boasting a   tall climbing wall with 3000 artificial hand holds as well as natural cracks and crevices.</p>
There is also an indoor running track in the upper level of the Sports Center.
<h3>On campus work assistance program</h3>
<p>PCC students who would otherwise not be able to afford a college education are given the opportunity to work on campus through PCC's Work Assistance program.
The work assistance program also provides a means for PCC to keep their costs down because, instead of hiring full-time staff to run the day to day operations of the campus, under the supervision of qualified staff the campus is largely run and maintained by PCC students.</p>
Students who are found with the opposite sex anywhere on campus deemed to be a unchaperoned area after 6 pm can be subject to being socialed as well.</li>
The Student Voice, a website designed to discuss such concerns about PCC, says, &quot;It is also inherently unfair to sanction a student for something when the individual doing the sanctioning is unknown.
Depending on the severity of the supposed rule violation will depend on whether or not the matter is actually looked into.
