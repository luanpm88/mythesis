<p>The <strong>University of Amsterdam</strong> () is a comprehensive research <a>university</a> located in the heart of the city of <a>Amsterdam</a>, <a>Netherlands</a>.
It has a strong internationalization programme and offers over 85 English Master programmes taught in English, as well as a number of Dutch and English language courses.
The University of Amsterdam (UvA) should not be confused with Amsterdam's other university, the <a>VU University</a>.
In 2006, the UvA joined the <a>League of European Research Universities</a> (LERU).
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The words &quot;Athenaeum Illustre&quot; on the gate of the Agnietenkapel</a> The commonly-held predecessor of the University of Amsterdam, the <em>Athenaeum Illustre</em> (Latin - the illustrious Athenaeum) was founded in the 14th-century Agnietenkapel in Amsterdam in 1632, to educate students in History and Philosophy.
In January 1632 two internationally acclaimed scholars, <a>Caspar Barlaeus</a> and <a>Gerardus Vossius</a>, held their inaugural speeches here.
In the course of the seventeenth century, Law, Medicine and Theology were introduced in the curriculum.
Alumni (whilst it was still the Athenaeum) include <a>Cornelis Petrus Tiele</a>.</p>
<p>The Athenaeum remained a small institution until the nineteenth century, with no more than 250 students and eight teachers.
In 1815 the Athenaeum Illustre was officially recognised as an institute of higher education.
In 1877, Athenuem Illustre is reorganised to become the university of the municipality of Amsterdam.
It became the <em>Gemeentelijke Universiteit van Amsterdam</em> (GU or 'Municipal University') and it received the right to confer doctoral degrees.
The <a>professor</a>s were appointed by the <a>city council</a> and the <a>mayor</a> presided over the university administration.
Because the <a>Amsterdam city council</a> was noted for its progressive politics this scheme guaranteed a large degree of intellectual freedom for the university.</p>
The university ceased to be the <em>Gemeentelijke Universiteit</em> and finally became the <em>Universiteit van Amsterdam</em>.</p>
<p>In 1969 the university became nationwide news when the university's administrative center at the <em>Maagdenhuis</em> was occupied by students who wanted more democratic influence.
During the seventies and eighties the university was often the target of nationwide student actions.</p>
<p>The Academic Centre for Dentistry in Amsterdam () (ACTA) was founded in <a>1984</a> through a merger of the two dentistry faculties of the Universiteit of Amsterdam and the <a>Vrije Universiteit</a>, Amsterdam.
ACTA conducts scientific research, teaches and provides patient care in the field of dentistry.
<p>The Faculty of Economics and Business () (FEB) was established in <a>1922</a>.

<p><a>thumb|right|The faculty of law at the Oudemanhuispoort</a> The Faculty of Law () (FdR) is housed in the Oudemanhuispoort, a historic building dating from 1602 situated in the centre of Amsterdam.
With 4000 students and 350 staff members, the Faculty of Law at the Universiteit van Amsterdam is one of the largest faculties in the Netherlands.
Research at the Faculty is undertaken by five research institutes which specialise in the following areas: <a>International law</a>, <a>Private law</a>, <a>Environmental law</a>, <a>Labour law</a> and <a>Information law</a>.</p>
The first, four-year phase consists mainly of thematic teaching.
The second, two-year phase consists of training - 'internships' - in- and outside of the AMC.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences () (FMG) is the largest educational and research institution in the <a>social</a> and <a>behavioural</a> sciences in the Netherlands.
<p>The Faculty is home to six departments: <a>Political Science</a>, <a>Sociology</a> and <a>Anthropology</a>, <a>Communication Science</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Social Geography</a>, <a>Planning and International Development Studies</a>, and <a>Educational sciences</a>.</p>
