established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Converse Hall</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school was founded in 1875 as the <strong>Salt Lake Collegiate Institute</strong>, a <a>prep school</a> under the supervision of the First <a>Presbyterian</a> Church of Salt Lake City.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At that time, members of many <a>Protestant Christian</a> denominations flocked to Salt Lake City in order to try to <a>convert</a> people who belonged to <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Westminster is the only remaining vestige of a trend in the late 19th century in which the Protestants set up private <a>primary</a> and <a>secondary</a> <a>school</a>s and offered free <a>tuition</a> to children in order to try to <a>convert</a> them from <a>Mormonism</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>College level classes were first offered in 1897 as <strong>Sheldon Jackson College</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was given that name after a Presbyterian minister and its primary benefactor, <a>Sheldon Jackson</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%High school level classes ceased to be offered in 1945.
established$$$@@@%%%Westminster severed its ties to the Presbyterian church in 1974.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college changed its name to &quot;Westminster College&quot; in 1902 to better reflect a more general Protestant education.
established$$$@@@%%%The name is derived from the <a>Westminster Confession of Faith</a>, a Presbyterian confession of faith, which, in turn, was named for a <a>London</a> <a>suburb</a> where it was devised.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Today, students from all religious persuasions (or none) are welcome.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college is also no longer antagonistic toward <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%About 40 percent of its students are Latter-day Saints, approximately the same percentage as for the general population of <a>Salt Lake City</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%As a means of marketing the school to LDS students, as well as students of non-Christian faith, the school abandoned the school mascot, the Parson, in favor of the more secular griffin.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The school also proposed abandoning its traditional crest emblem, a shield emblazoned with the term &quot;Pro Christo et Libertate.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%After students actively protested the administrative effort, however, the school crest was preserved.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Westminster was the first <a>accredit</a>ed two year <a>junior college</a> in <a>Utah</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It became a liberal arts institution in 1949.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Originally located in <a>downtown Salt Lake City</a>, the college moved to its present <a>campus</a> on  in the <a>Sugar House</a> neighborhood of the city.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The current president of Westminster College is Dr. <a>Michael S. Bassis</a>, who was appointed in 2002.</p>
