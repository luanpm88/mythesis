country$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:Mgr4Rw.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[MG
established$$$@@@%%%Ramachandran]] Receiving the Doctorate conferred on him by the University of Madras]] The first ever demand for higher education in <a>Madras Presidency</a> was voiced forth in a public address to The Right Honourable <a>Lord John Elphinstone</a> G.C.H., Governor of Madras signed by 70,000 local residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating &quot;some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%This public petition, which was presented by the then Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English College in the city of Madras.
established$$$@@@%%%Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a Central Collegiate Institution or a &#x2018;University.&#x2019;
established$$$@@@%%%This University had twin Departments (1) High School for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, (2) College providing instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its President.
established$$$@@@%%%This was the precursor of the present <a>Presidency College, Chennai</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%However, a systematic educational policy for India was only formulated 14 years later by the historic dispatch of 1854 (<a>Sir Charles Wood&#x2019;s</a> Education Dispatch), which pointed out the rationale for &quot;creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the Universities of Professorships &quot;for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%As a sequel, the University of Madras, organized on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the Legislative <a>Council of India</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Madras progressed and expanded throughout the 19th century to span the whole of <a>South India</a> and subsequently gave birth to and nourished universities like <a>Mysore University</a> (1916), <a>Osmania University</a> (1918), <a>Andhra University</a> (1926), <a>Annamalai University</a> (1929), <a>Travancore University</a> (1937) presently <a>University of Kerala</a>, <a>Sri Venkateswara University</a> (1954), <a>Madurai Kamaraj University</a> (1966), <a>Bharathidasan University</a> (1982), <a>Bharathiar University</a> (1982), <a>Manonmaniam Sundaranar University</a> (1990), <a>Tamil Nadu Agricultural University</a> (1971), Anna University (1978), <a>Tamil University</a> (1981), <a>Mother Teresa Women's University</a> (1984), <a>The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University</a> (1989), <a>Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University</a> (1989), <a>Periyar University</a> (1997) and the Tamil Nadu <a>Dr.Ambedkar Law University</a> (1996).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1912 endowments were made to the University to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics.
established$$$@@@%%%In all there were 17 University departments, 30 University teachers, 69 research scholars and 127 University publications in that year and the budget was for Rs.11 lakhs.
established$$$@@@%%%Later, the research and teaching functions of the University were encouraged by <a>Sadler Commission</a> and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of <em>Madras University Act</em> of 1923.
established$$$@@@%%%About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from Berhampur of Orissa in the North, Trivandrum of Kerala in the South West, Bangalore and Mangalore of Karnataka in the West and Hyderabad of Andhra Pradesh in the North.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>However, Indian independence in 1947, the setting up of the University Grants Commission in 1956 and changes in political, social and cultural milieu had brought several amendments to the University of Madras Act of 1923 to permit qualitative and quantitative changes in its jurisdictions and functions.</p>
