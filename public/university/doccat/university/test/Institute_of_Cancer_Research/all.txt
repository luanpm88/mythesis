established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>Institute of Cancer Research</strong> (the <strong>ICR</strong>) is a <a>cancer</a> research institute located in <a>London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a> and a constituent college of the federal <a>University of London</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Institute was founded in 1909 as a research department of the <a>Royal Marsden Hospital</a> and joined the University of London in 2003.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>Together with the Royal Marsden Hospital, the ICR forms the largest comprehensive cancer centre in <a>Europe</a> and it is ranked first amongst all British higher education institutions in the <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> 2008 Research Assessment Exercise Table of Excellence.
students$$$@@@%%%In addition to its research activities the ICR provides both taught degree programmes and postgraduate research degrees and currently has around 290 students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR occupies two sites, one in <a>Chelsea</a> in <a>Central London</a> and one in <a>Sutton</a> in southwest London.
established$$$@@@%%%It had a total income of &#x00a3;83.8 million in 2008/09, of which &#x00a3;48.3 million was from research grants and contracts.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR receives its funding from the British government, charities including the <a>Wellcome Trust</a>, <a>Cancer Research UK</a>, <a>Breakthrough Breast Cancer</a> and <a>Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research</a>, and public donations.
established$$$@@@%%%It runs the <a>Everyman Campaign</a>, which raises awareness of male cancers and funds research into testicular and prostate cancer at the Everyman Centre, which is based at the ICR.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
doctoral$$$@@@%%%<h3>20th century</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR dates its foundation to 1909, when a new laboratory building adjoining The Cancer Hospital (now named the <a>Royal Marsden Hospital</a>) was established with Dr Alexander Paine as its first Director.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In June 2009, the ICR announced the results of the Phase I trial of the drug olaparib in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, including patients with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.
established$$$@@@%%%In more than half of the patients tumours shrank or stabilised.
established$$$@@@%%%The drug is a PARP inhibitor and the scientists believe it may be useful in other patients whose cancer is linked to an error in their DNA repair pathway.
established$$$@@@%%%Laboratory tests published in September 2009, conducted at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the ICR, showed it may also be useful against cancer cells with a faulty PTEN gene.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>ICR scientists discovered the gene <a>BRCA2</a>, which has been linked to <a>breast cancer</a>, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer.
established$$$@@@%%%ICR scientists characterised the cancer gene BRAF, which has sped up drug development for the treatment of malignant melanomas and other tumours.
president$$$@@@%%%In April 2009, the ICR revealed that damage to the BRAF gene could cause up to 70 per cent of melanoma skin cancers.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Other oncogenes found include those linked to prostate cancer and lung cancer.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Mission</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR's stated mission is to:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
free_label$$$@@@%%%  <li>conduct research into the causes, prevention, diagnosis and methods of cancer treatment;</li>
staff$$$@@@%%%  <li>provide education and advanced training for medical and scientific staff; and</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>provide treatment and care for cancer patients in partnership with <a>The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust</a>.</li>

country$$$@@@%%%<h2>Research</h2>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR pursues three main research themes: <a>genetic epidemiology</a>, molecular pathology, and therapeutic development.</p>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>In conjunction with the Royal Marsden, the ICR is currently testing a promising new prostate cancer drug called abiraterone, which it developed.
established$$$@@@%%%Results from a Phase II trial of the drug showed benefit for up to two-thirds of men with advanced and aggressive prostate cancer, and a Phase III trial is ongoing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Recently<img>, the ICR launched the Integrative Network Biology initiative (inbi) which aims to perform quantitative systems and network biology studies of the metastatic process.
established$$$@@@%%%As part of this initiative ICR have established a proteomics core facility equipped with state-of-the-art mass spectrometers.
established$$$@@@%%%The facility currently holds several instruments including the TSQ Vantage for scheduled SRM and the LTQ-Orbitrap Velos for IDA.
former_names$$$@@@%%%As part of the initiative the ICR is also establishing a supercomputing core which will support the research projects demanding computational systems biology.
established$$$@@@%%%The ICR is hosting world-leading research groups in network and systems biology, for example the Cellular &amp; Molecular Logic Team [<a>http://www.lindinglab.org</a>].</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In March 2009, the ICR announced that it had identified a key enzyme responsible for the spread of cancer, which causes 90% of all cancer patient deaths.
country$$$@@@%%%Research into the lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme is ongoing.</p>
vice-president$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) are currently developing a strong Molecular Pathology initiative.
established$$$@@@%%%Detailed information on the genetic make-up of all cancers is becoming increasingly available - with much of this also to the credit of the ICR - and with this comes the exciting potential for them to discover new, even more selective targets for therapy.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Furthermore the ICR and RMH will continue to develop robust molecular diagnostic techniques which will accurately predict who will benefit most from a treatment, ensuring a patient receives the optimum drug(s) for the best possible outcome.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The research will be carried out in a new $30 million Centre for Molecular Pathology (CMP)&lt;<a>http://www.icr.ac.uk/support_us/appeals/mol_pathology/index.shtml</a>&gt; and will build on their existing expertise in breast, prostate and paediatric cancers, while providing opportunities for new developments in other cancers such as gastrointestinal, renal, gynaecological, melanoma, head &amp; neck cancers and sarcomas.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In all cases, the teams in the CMP will aim to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets and to develop markers to identify the subgroups of cancer patients that would benefit most from novel and existing treatments.</p>
