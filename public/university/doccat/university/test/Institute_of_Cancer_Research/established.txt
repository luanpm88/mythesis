<p>The <strong>Institute of Cancer Research</strong> (the <strong>ICR</strong>) is a <a>cancer</a> research institute located in <a>London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a> and a constituent college of the federal <a>University of London</a>.
The Institute was founded in 1909 as a research department of the <a>Royal Marsden Hospital</a> and joined the University of London in 2003.</p>
<p>The ICR occupies two sites, one in <a>Chelsea</a> in <a>Central London</a> and one in <a>Sutton</a> in southwest London.
It had a total income of &#x00a3;83.8 million in 2008/09, of which &#x00a3;48.3 million was from research grants and contracts.</p>
<p>The ICR receives its funding from the British government, charities including the <a>Wellcome Trust</a>, <a>Cancer Research UK</a>, <a>Breakthrough Breast Cancer</a> and <a>Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research</a>, and public donations.
It runs the <a>Everyman Campaign</a>, which raises awareness of male cancers and funds research into testicular and prostate cancer at the Everyman Centre, which is based at the ICR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ICR dates its foundation to 1909, when a new laboratory building adjoining The Cancer Hospital (now named the <a>Royal Marsden Hospital</a>) was established with Dr Alexander Paine as its first Director.</p>
<p>In June 2009, the ICR announced the results of the Phase I trial of the drug olaparib in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, including patients with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.
In more than half of the patients tumours shrank or stabilised.
The drug is a PARP inhibitor and the scientists believe it may be useful in other patients whose cancer is linked to an error in their DNA repair pathway.
Laboratory tests published in September 2009, conducted at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the ICR, showed it may also be useful against cancer cells with a faulty PTEN gene.
<p>ICR scientists discovered the gene <a>BRCA2</a>, which has been linked to <a>breast cancer</a>, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer.
ICR scientists characterised the cancer gene BRAF, which has sped up drug development for the treatment of malignant melanomas and other tumours.
<p>The ICR's stated mission is to:</p>
<li>provide treatment and care for cancer patients in partnership with <a>The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust</a>.</li>
Results from a Phase II trial of the drug showed benefit for up to two-thirds of men with advanced and aggressive prostate cancer, and a Phase III trial is ongoing.</p>
<p>Recently<img>, the ICR launched the Integrative Network Biology initiative (inbi) which aims to perform quantitative systems and network biology studies of the metastatic process.
As part of this initiative ICR have established a proteomics core facility equipped with state-of-the-art mass spectrometers.
The facility currently holds several instruments including the TSQ Vantage for scheduled SRM and the LTQ-Orbitrap Velos for IDA.
The ICR is hosting world-leading research groups in network and systems biology, for example the Cellular &amp; Molecular Logic Team [<a>http://www.lindinglab.org</a>].</p>
<p>In March 2009, the ICR announced that it had identified a key enzyme responsible for the spread of cancer, which causes 90% of all cancer patient deaths.
Detailed information on the genetic make-up of all cancers is becoming increasingly available - with much of this also to the credit of the ICR - and with this comes the exciting potential for them to discover new, even more selective targets for therapy.
