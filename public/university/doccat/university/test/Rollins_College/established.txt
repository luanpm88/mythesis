<p>In 2000, the Rollins College's Peace Monument was featured in a <em><a>New York Times</a></em> article.</p>
<p>Erected in 1938 and dedicated on Armistice Day by college president Hamilton Holt, it consists of a German artillery shell, surrendered by Germany at the end of the First World War, mounted on a pedestal, bearing this inscription:</p>
<p>:This Engine of Destruction, Torture and Death Symbolizes: :The Prostitution of the Inventor :The Avarice of the Manufacturer :The Blood-guilt of the statesman :The Savagery of the Soldier :The Perverted Patriotism of the Citizen :The Debasement of the Human Race</p>
<p>:That it can be Employed as an Instrument of Defense of Liberty, Justice and Right in Nowise Invalidates the Truth of the Words Here Graven.</p>
<p>The top half of the monument was stolen by vandals during <a>World War II</a>, but the bottom half survives and is in the stairwell leading to the second floor of the Mills Memorial building.</p>

The museum was built instead of what would have been the <a>Ackland Art Museum</a> at Rollins; millionaire and amateur art collector William Hayes Ackland wanted to leave his fortune to a Southern university for an art museum and narrowed his choices to <a>Duke University</a>, the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, and Rollins, in that order.
At first, the school rejected the offer made by Okinawan officials, who suggested that a replica of the statue will be presented to the school if the original was returned to the island; however, after consulting both with <a>State Department</a> and the school's board of trustees, then President Rita Bornstein accepted the offer and the statue was returned to Okinawa in 1995 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of <a>World War II</a>.
In addition to providing the school with a replica of the original statue, the government of Okinawa and Rollins signed an &quot;an agreement of cooperation&quot; that pledges to develop additional cooperative projects between the College and Shogaku Junior and Senior High School, the Okinawan school where the original statue has been placed.</li>
<li>On March 31, 1998, the body of Jennifer Leah Kairis, a <a>sophomore</a> student, was found in her Ward Hall <a>dormitory</a> room by a <a>residential assistant</a>.
At first, the assistant medical examiner at the <a>Orange County</a> coroner's office ruled Kairis' death as a <a>homicide</a>.
However, that conclusion was quickly changed after Dr. Shashi Gore, the county's chief medical examiner ruled that she had died as a result of an accidental prescription drug overdose.
Kairis' parents, who always believed their daughter was raped and murdered by her college boyfriend, requested a lengthy state investigation into their daughter's death due to their belief that the Winter Park Police Department botched the case.
On March 4, 2004, Dr. Bruce Hyma, the <a>Miami-Dade County</a> chief medical examiner and expert toxicologist hired by <a>Orange County</a> State Attorney Lawson Lamar ruled that Kairis had committed suicide via a prescription drug <a>overdose</a>.
The seven year investigation was officially closed on April 13, 2005.
