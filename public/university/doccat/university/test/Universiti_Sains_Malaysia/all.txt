established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Universiti Sains Malaysia</strong> (, <a>acronym</a>: <strong>USM</strong>) is a public <a>university</a> with its main <a>campus</a> in <a>Penang</a>, <a>Malaysia</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%There are three branch campuses: one in mainland Penang (<a>Engineering</a>), one in Kelantan on the east coast of <a>Peninsular Malaysia</a>, and a offshore collaboration with a university in <a>India</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This offshore five-year M.D. programme is conducted at the <a>Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Belgaum)</a>, KLE University, Belgaum, Bangalore, India  offering the MD (USM) or better known as the Doctor of <a>Medicine</a> undergraduate degree.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%USM plans to open a Kuala Lumpur campus.
established$$$@@@%%%With around 29,789 students in 2006, USM is one of the biggest universities in terms of enrollment in Malaysia.
established$$$@@@%%%The number of <a>lecturer</a>s is about 1,606, which leads to a student-lecturer ratio of around 1:23.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The establishment of USM began with an agreement through a resolution which was approved by the Penang State Legislative Assembly in 1962, which called for the establishment of a university college in the state.
established$$$@@@%%%The acquisition of a piece of land in Sungai Ara was then followed by the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Y.T.M Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj on 7 August 1967.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>USM was established in 1969 as the second university in Malaysia.
established$$$@@@%%%It was first known as <strong>Universiti Pulau Pinang</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%Initially, the university operated on borrowed premises at the Malayan Teachers' Training College at Gelugor.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1971, it moved to its present 239.4-hectare
established$$$@@@%%%site at Minden (formerly <a>Minden Barracks</a> of the <a>British Far East Command</a>) in <a>Gelugor</a>, approximately 9.7 kilometres from the city of Georgetown.
established$$$@@@%%%The site, which consists mainly of undulating land, is an ideal location to house a university campus.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>There are now two other USM campuses: one at Kubang Kerian in Kelantan, known as the Health Campus, and the other at Seri Ampangan in Penang, known as the Engineering Campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The former houses the School of Medical Sciences, the School of Health Sciences and the School of Dental Sciences, while the latter houses the six engineering schools.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From the outset, Universiti Sains Malaysia was given the mandate to provide, promote and develop learning in the fields of Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Building Science and Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities and Education as well as to conduct research and foster the dissemination of such knowledge.
established$$$@@@%%%To date, the University has not departed from these mandates and has made significant progress in meeting its academic, social, and national obligations.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The management of the University is carried out through the executive power of the Board of Directors, made up of members chosen from the University, representatives from government departments and those appointed by the Ministry of Higher Education.
established$$$@@@%%%As an executive council, the Board of Directors retains the right to wield power entrusted to it by the University Constitution, Statutes, Acts and Regulations.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From its humble beginnings with an intake of 57 science students, Universiti Sains Malaysia had made great strides.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Today, USM offers a wide range of courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels to more than 28,000 students.
students$$$@@@%%%USM has emerged as one of the most widely acclaimed universities locally and abroad.
established$$$@@@%%%The success achieved, especially in research, including the latest through the Asian Innovation Award in which USM emerged as the only winner from this country, has placed USM on the world map.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academic programmes</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>USM has always been guided in its activities by the need to develop a personality and identity of its own.
established$$$@@@%%%Since its establishment, it has adopted an innovative approach to higher education and departed significantly from the traditional faculty system of an academic organisation.
established$$$@@@%%%In its place, the university introduced a system that allows for a multidisciplinary approach.
established$$$@@@%%%The policy was to combine subjects and to organise programs so that a degree of specialisation in a chosen subject was possible.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
head_label$$$@@@%%%<p>To date, 24 academic schools, 14 centres and 7 units have been established.
website$$$@@@%%%Of the schools, 12 are applied science and technology-based schools: Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering; Chemical Engineering; Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Housing, Building and Planning; Industrial Technology; Medical Sciences; Dental Sciences; Health Sciences; and Pharmaceutical Sciences.
website$$$@@@%%%The three liberal arts schools are Educational Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.
website$$$@@@%%%The pure science schools are Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Computer Sciences, and Physics, all of which offer courses that are similar to those traditionally available in other universities.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In December 1989, the School of Management was set up, having evolved from the Management program within the School of Social Sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%As part of its continuing expansion, the university established the School of Computer Sciences and the School of Communication as of March 1995.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>The centres and ancillary services include the Centre for Languages and Translation, the National Poison Centre, the Doping Control Centre, the Centre for Archaeological Research Malaysia, the Centre for Educational Technology and Multimedia, the Computer Centre, the Centre for Knowledge, Communication and Technology and the Islamic Centre.
country$$$@@@%%%There are research centres, namely the Centre for Policy Research, the Centre for Drug Research and the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies.
established$$$@@@%%%The distance education program offered through the School of Distance Education is another innovative program adopted by the University in 1971.
established$$$@@@%%%It has gained an encouraging response from working adults and is set to be developed further in this decade to cater for new directions and needs.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>In the field of research, the emphasis is on function-oriented or interdisciplinary research.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The main focus is on areas that integrate academic interest and practical relevance, thus directing scientific thrusts towards breakthroughs in areas crucial to the quality of life and national development.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|300px|The main gate at the main campus of USM</a> USM is one of six universities in Malaysia that have been identified as <a>research</a>-intensive universities, with the other being <a>University of Malaya</a> and <a>Universiti Putra Malaysia</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This is in tandem with its mission and vision to be a world-class university embarking on world-class research programmes through strategic planning and implementation of its <a>R&amp;D</a> mechanism.
students$$$@@@%%%The university has qualified academic staff and excellent human resource support to realise its mission.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Campuses</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Besides the main campus in Minden, USM has two other campuses: one at <a>Kubang Kerian</a> in <a>Kelantan</a> known as Health Campus  and the other at <a>Seri Ampangan</a>, <a>Nibong Tebal</a> in mainland Penang known as Engineering Campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Started as a USM hospital in 1982, the health campus has expanded after the School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus to the present site which is 72.84 hectares.
established$$$@@@%%%The School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus in June 1984.
established$$$@@@%%%The Medical School recently celebrated 30 years since its establishment.
type$$$@@@%%%There are now two other schools in the health campus &mdash; the School of Dental Science and the School of Allied Health Sciences.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The engineering campus moved to the present site from its previous site in <a>Tronoh</a>, <a>Perak</a> in 1996.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h2>Research</h2>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:USMDewanTuanku.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Dewan Tuanku Syed Putra: The main auditorium of USM on the main campus on [[Penang|Penang Island]]]] Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) offers excellent opportunities for research and education to local and foreign scholars.
students$$$@@@%%%The university's core competencies are teaching, research and consultancies, which relate directly to the advancement of human resource development and capacity building, knowledge and industrial competitiveness.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>To develop as a teaching and research institution of international repute and to perform its expected role in society and in the world of learning, the university must continue to develop a broad-based research infrastructure involving the acquisition of a wide range of equipment, laboratory facilities and library holdings.
established$$$@@@%%%University research in many ways differs from corporate R&amp;D and from the activities of specialised R&amp;D institutions in that it must address a wider range of problems, be more tolerant or open minded, perform purely theoretical investigations and incorporate literary, artistic, philosophical, social and other fields of study in its research endeavours.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The route taken for the development of academic excellence at USM has been the establishment of research institutes, centres and units.
established$$$@@@%%%A criterion for the setting up of these entities has always been that the areas they cover must be the ones in which there have already been notable achievements and where the setting up of formal structures would help to mobilise more effectively research talent and expertise from different disciplines and from different parts of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%But it has always been understood that these structures, while providing better opportunities for integration and networking, would not replace or reduce the research roles of the teaching schools and their staff; a cardinal rule in the university's overall planning has been that principal areas of teaching and research would overlap, as would areas of staff and postgraduate research, to the common advantage of all.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University has always emphasised the interdisciplinary approach in all its programmes and this is reflected in both its academic structure and research activities.
staff$$$@@@%%%The Science Fund funding is the main source of R&amp;D for USM.
established$$$@@@%%%However, to promote research, the university allocates money from its operating funds annually as incentive and for short-term research purposes.
staff$$$@@@%%%External funds, mainly in the form of research grants, awards and consultancies won by individual academic staff members, also feature prominently.
nickname$$$@@@%%%There are external sources of funding as well, but these are largely ad hoc and do not, as a rule, result in the development of major research facilities.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Some external research links have been established through individual and through institutional networking arrangements.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>These are areas in which USM is able to contribute effectively to the national research effort and to the advancement of knowledge in general.
former_names$$$@@@%%%In other words, these are areas in which the university is already strong and enjoys a favourable reputation or in which the required expertise and support facilities are in place at several research clusters at the respective schools or at the research centres.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h3>Research areas</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Research areas of special strength at USM include brain and neuroscience, environmental science, aquaculture, biomedical and pharmaceutical studies, natural language processing and computer aided translation, information technology, food technology, polymer science and technology,  biotechnology, distance education, geographical information system, structure analysis, materials science, engineering, surface chemistry, and robotic vision.
established$$$@@@%%%Penang has excellent research facilities for collaborative search, particularly in coastal pollution, mangrove ecosystem and marine aquaculture.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<h2>Education</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Graduate studies</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|300px|The international office of USM</a> USM offers three modes of study for the graduate programmes, i.e., by research, by a combination of coursework and research (mixed mode), or by coursework.
students$$$@@@%%%In 2003, there were about 5,122 students in the master&#x2019;s and doctoral level programmes.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Almost 11.8% of them are nationals from more than 40 countries.
students$$$@@@%%%The majority of the foreign students are from other parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Undergraduate studies</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Almost all undergraduate degree programmes at the university require a minimum full-time residence of three years.
established$$$@@@%%%Degrees in engineering, health sciences, pharmacy, medicine and dentistry, however, require minimum periods of study between four and five years.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Most undergraduate courses are taught in <a>Bahasa Malaysia</a> but the newer batch of undergraduate students are taught in English, especially in science courses.
established$$$@@@%%%International students have to demonstrate a level of proficiency in the national language as part of the entrance criteria.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Other study programmes</h3>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>USM has programmes for foreign students, and they can undertake one or two semesters.
staff$$$@@@%%%These students are considered full time and enjoy the benefits of USM's academic and physical facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%The university and its community benefits from the cross-cultural flow of students and gains international standing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>USM has a school of distance education.
established$$$@@@%%%It was established in 1971 to provide opportunities for local working adults to obtain a tertiary qualification.
staff$$$@@@%%%These students are able to undertake undergraduate courses while they are in full-time employment.
students$$$@@@%%%At present only four undergraduate degree programmes are available through distance learning: bachelor of science, bachelor of social science, bachelor of arts, and bachelor of management.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Healthy Campus</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>&#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019;, a uniquely USM innovation, was initiated by the vice-chancellor in 2001 as the Healthy Campus Programme.
nickname$$$@@@%%%But unlike the healthy campus programmes elsewhere, &#x2018;Sejahtera&#x2019; reaches beyond health to include ideas for sustainable development.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>&#x2018;Sejahtera&#x2019; in Malay embraces peace, harmony, tranquility, wellness and health.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%There is no equivalent word in English.
established$$$@@@%%%As a concept, &#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019; is meant to guide the entire USM community to focus their commitment and responsibility to the university.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Every individual has a role to play through personal initiatives, positive attributes, proactive actions and volunteerism in nurturing the development of the campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Teamwork is essential and must cut across departments and hierarchies to initiate new ideas to contribute to the growth of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%The idea of <a>insourcing</a> is an important mechanism for implementation to tap academic and theoretical knowledge of in-house expertise for practical applications.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Two other aspects of the programme require all initiatives to be data-driven, informed by analysis and monitored with complete documentation.
head_label$$$@@@%%%So far, more than 17 monographs and books have been published under the &#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019; programme.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>&#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019; is limited to the projects funded by the programme.
type$$$@@@%%%It is a framework which encompasses five underlying values.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>The first is to create a mindset for every individual to take responsibility for the campus.</li>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<li>The second value seeks to create spaces, both physical and social, which are conducive for work, play and learning.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%<li>Third, the practices in the campus must promote the ideals of sustainable development that is environmentally-friendly,</li>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</ul>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>pedestrian-friendly, work- and people-friendly as well as promote healthy lifestyles.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
students$$$@@@%%%  <li>The fourth value is provision of quality health and dental care services to students, staff and dependents of staff focusing on wellness.</li>
type$$$@@@%%%<li>Finally, &#x2018;Kesejahteraan&#x2019; supports any activity or project which propagates the pursuit of a sustainable campus.
free_label$$$@@@%%%These include every aspect of the university such as teaching, research, publication, training, administration, management, student-centred activities, food and catering, transportation, waste management, construction and maintenance and anything else which could conceivably contribute to 'kesejahteraan', healthy living and a sustainable lifestyle.</li>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</ul>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Based on those values and principles, the secretariat in collaboration with other parties, staff and students continues to implement new and old projects/ program to improve the quality of life of the campus community and the environment.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>sains@usm</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Universiti Sains Malaysia has launch Science and Arts Innovation Space, known as sains@usm, which is dedicated towards nurturing innovation in science and arts.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was ranked 111st in the <a>World University Rankings 2004</a> published by the <em><a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em>.
established$$$@@@%%%However, it dropped out of the list of top 200 universities in the world in 2005.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>USM vice-chancellor Prof Tan Sri Dato' Dzulkifli Abdul Razak said that the addition of new criteria such as the employer survey could have contributed to the sharp drop in the university's integrity: &quot;Our poor standing could also be attributed to the fact that we are a relatively young university compared to UM which is 100 years old.
established$$$@@@%%%They have built up a stable reputation in that time.&quot;
country$$$@@@%%%Prof. Dzulkifli also cited the poor staff-student ratio in Malaysian universities: &quot;Over the past years we have doubled our intake.
students$$$@@@%%%USM now has 35,000 students including 28,000 undergraduates but the number of lecturers, about 1,400 has not increased in tandem.&quot;
