<p><strong>Universiti Sains Malaysia</strong> (, <a>acronym</a>: <strong>USM</strong>) is a public <a>university</a> with its main <a>campus</a> in <a>Penang</a>, <a>Malaysia</a>.
There are three branch campuses: one in mainland Penang (<a>Engineering</a>), one in Kelantan on the east coast of <a>Peninsular Malaysia</a>, and a offshore collaboration with a university in <a>India</a>.
This offshore five-year M.D. programme is conducted at the <a>Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Belgaum)</a>, KLE University, Belgaum, Bangalore, India  offering the MD (USM) or better known as the Doctor of <a>Medicine</a> undergraduate degree.
With around 29,789 students in 2006, USM is one of the biggest universities in terms of enrollment in Malaysia.
The number of <a>lecturer</a>s is about 1,606, which leads to a student-lecturer ratio of around 1:23.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The establishment of USM began with an agreement through a resolution which was approved by the Penang State Legislative Assembly in 1962, which called for the establishment of a university college in the state.
The acquisition of a piece of land in Sungai Ara was then followed by the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Y.T.M Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj on 7 August 1967.</p>
<p>USM was established in 1969 as the second university in Malaysia.
It was first known as <strong>Universiti Pulau Pinang</strong>.
Initially, the university operated on borrowed premises at the Malayan Teachers' Training College at Gelugor.
site at Minden (formerly <a>Minden Barracks</a> of the <a>British Far East Command</a>) in <a>Gelugor</a>, approximately 9.7 kilometres from the city of Georgetown.
The site, which consists mainly of undulating land, is an ideal location to house a university campus.
The former houses the School of Medical Sciences, the School of Health Sciences and the School of Dental Sciences, while the latter houses the six engineering schools.</p>
<p>From the outset, Universiti Sains Malaysia was given the mandate to provide, promote and develop learning in the fields of Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Building Science and Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities and Education as well as to conduct research and foster the dissemination of such knowledge.
To date, the University has not departed from these mandates and has made significant progress in meeting its academic, social, and national obligations.
<p>The management of the University is carried out through the executive power of the Board of Directors, made up of members chosen from the University, representatives from government departments and those appointed by the Ministry of Higher Education.
As an executive council, the Board of Directors retains the right to wield power entrusted to it by the University Constitution, Statutes, Acts and Regulations.</p>
<p>From its humble beginnings with an intake of 57 science students, Universiti Sains Malaysia had made great strides.
The success achieved, especially in research, including the latest through the Asian Innovation Award in which USM emerged as the only winner from this country, has placed USM on the world map.</p>
<p>USM has always been guided in its activities by the need to develop a personality and identity of its own.
Since its establishment, it has adopted an innovative approach to higher education and departed significantly from the traditional faculty system of an academic organisation.
In its place, the university introduced a system that allows for a multidisciplinary approach.
The policy was to combine subjects and to organise programs so that a degree of specialisation in a chosen subject was possible.
<p>In December 1989, the School of Management was set up, having evolved from the Management program within the School of Social Sciences.
As part of its continuing expansion, the university established the School of Computer Sciences and the School of Communication as of March 1995.
The distance education program offered through the School of Distance Education is another innovative program adopted by the University in 1971.
It has gained an encouraging response from working adults and is set to be developed further in this decade to cater for new directions and needs.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|The main gate at the main campus of USM</a> USM is one of six universities in Malaysia that have been identified as <a>research</a>-intensive universities, with the other being <a>University of Malaya</a> and <a>Universiti Putra Malaysia</a>.
This is in tandem with its mission and vision to be a world-class university embarking on world-class research programmes through strategic planning and implementation of its <a>R&amp;D</a> mechanism.
<p>Besides the main campus in Minden, USM has two other campuses: one at <a>Kubang Kerian</a> in <a>Kelantan</a> known as Health Campus  and the other at <a>Seri Ampangan</a>, <a>Nibong Tebal</a> in mainland Penang known as Engineering Campus.</p>
<p>Started as a USM hospital in 1982, the health campus has expanded after the School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus to the present site which is 72.84 hectares.
The School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus in June 1984.
The Medical School recently celebrated 30 years since its establishment.
<p>The engineering campus moved to the present site from its previous site in <a>Tronoh</a>, <a>Perak</a> in 1996.</p>
<p>To develop as a teaching and research institution of international repute and to perform its expected role in society and in the world of learning, the university must continue to develop a broad-based research infrastructure involving the acquisition of a wide range of equipment, laboratory facilities and library holdings.
University research in many ways differs from corporate R&amp;D and from the activities of specialised R&amp;D institutions in that it must address a wider range of problems, be more tolerant or open minded, perform purely theoretical investigations and incorporate literary, artistic, philosophical, social and other fields of study in its research endeavours.</p>
A criterion for the setting up of these entities has always been that the areas they cover must be the ones in which there have already been notable achievements and where the setting up of formal structures would help to mobilise more effectively research talent and expertise from different disciplines and from different parts of the university.
But it has always been understood that these structures, while providing better opportunities for integration and networking, would not replace or reduce the research roles of the teaching schools and their staff; a cardinal rule in the university's overall planning has been that principal areas of teaching and research would overlap, as would areas of staff and postgraduate research, to the common advantage of all.</p>
<p>The University has always emphasised the interdisciplinary approach in all its programmes and this is reflected in both its academic structure and research activities.
However, to promote research, the university allocates money from its operating funds annually as incentive and for short-term research purposes.
<p>Research areas of special strength at USM include brain and neuroscience, environmental science, aquaculture, biomedical and pharmaceutical studies, natural language processing and computer aided translation, information technology, food technology, polymer science and technology,  biotechnology, distance education, geographical information system, structure analysis, materials science, engineering, surface chemistry, and robotic vision.
Penang has excellent research facilities for collaborative search, particularly in coastal pollution, mangrove ecosystem and marine aquaculture.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|The international office of USM</a> USM offers three modes of study for the graduate programmes, i.e., by research, by a combination of coursework and research (mixed mode), or by coursework.
Degrees in engineering, health sciences, pharmacy, medicine and dentistry, however, require minimum periods of study between four and five years.
International students have to demonstrate a level of proficiency in the national language as part of the entrance criteria.</p>
The university and its community benefits from the cross-cultural flow of students and gains international standing.</p>
<p>USM has a school of distance education.
It was established in 1971 to provide opportunities for local working adults to obtain a tertiary qualification.

The university offers housing for approximately 75% of its students.
In fact, its ground was used for <a>2008 U/19 Cricket World Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout 2006, activities involving the Department of Student Affairs and Development were carried out.
<p>&#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019;, a uniquely USM innovation, was initiated by the vice-chancellor in 2001 as the Healthy Campus Programme.
<p>&#x2018;Sejahtera&#x2019; in Malay embraces peace, harmony, tranquility, wellness and health.
As a concept, &#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019; is meant to guide the entire USM community to focus their commitment and responsibility to the university.
Teamwork is essential and must cut across departments and hierarchies to initiate new ideas to contribute to the growth of the university.
The idea of <a>insourcing</a> is an important mechanism for implementation to tap academic and theoretical knowledge of in-house expertise for practical applications.
<p>&#x2018;Kampus Sejahtera&#x2019; is limited to the projects funded by the programme.
<li>The first is to create a mindset for every individual to take responsibility for the campus.</li>
<li>Third, the practices in the campus must promote the ideals of sustainable development that is environmentally-friendly,</li>
<p>Based on those values and principles, the secretariat in collaboration with other parties, staff and students continues to implement new and old projects/ program to improve the quality of life of the campus community and the environment.</p>
<p>Universiti Sains Malaysia has launch Science and Arts Innovation Space, known as sains@usm, which is dedicated towards nurturing innovation in science and arts.</p>
<p>The sains@usm space is created to enable entrepreneurs, investors, scientists and artists to blend their respective fields in a sustainable environment.
sains@usm recognises that arts contribute to society in tandem with science and technology and together act as catalysts for a balanced society.</p>
<p>With sains@usm, the university hopes to retain the best talents within the university system, nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs and showcase its research achievements and academic talents.
The facility is designed to foster a closer relationship between academia and industry, fast-track technology transfer, commercialisation of technology and create a springboard for new intellectual property creations.</p>
The architecture of the Science and Arts Innovation Space embodies a contemporary design influenced by traditional indigenous architecture for the tropical climate which is respectful of nature and the ecosystem as well as local cultural values.
Each habitable room will face a picturesque view of greenery and water elements, bringing nature indoors so as to ignite the creative energy.</p>
The facilities will be built along contour lines, creating green environments and a reduction in energy needs.</p>
<p>The university was ranked 111st in the <a>World University Rankings 2004</a> published by the <em><a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em>.
However, it dropped out of the list of top 200 universities in the world in 2005.
They have built up a stable reputation in that time.&quot;
<p>On 3 Sept 2008, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) was declared the Apex (Accelerated Programme for Excellence) University by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia.
<p>Asian university rankings under life sciences and biomedicine has placed this university as number 20 according to the QS Asian University rankings 2010.</p>
