<p> <strong>The University of Wyoming</strong> is a <a>land-grant university</a> located in <a>Laramie</a>, <a>Wyoming</a>, situated on Wyoming's high <a>Laramie Plains</a>, at an elevation of 7,200 feet (2194 m), between the <a>Laramie</a> and <a>Snowy Range</a> mountains.
It is known as <strong>UW</strong> (often pronounced &quot;U-Dub&quot;) to people close to the university.
The university was founded in September 1886, four years before the territory was admitted as the 44th state, and opened in September 1887.
The University of Wyoming is unusual in that its location within the state is provided by the state's constitution.
The university also offers <a>outreach</a> education in communities throughout Wyoming and online.</p>
<p>The University of Wyoming consists of seven colleges: agriculture, arts and sciences, business, education, engineering, health sciences, and <a>Law</a>.
The university maintains an average class size of 29 students; one of the lowest such numbers among four-year schools in the west.
In the top 15 percent of the country's four-year colleges, the University of Wyoming was featured in the 2011 Princeton Review Best 373 Colleges.</p>
<p>In addition to on-campus classes in Laramie, the university&#x2019;s Outreach School offers more than 30 degree, certificates and endorsement programs to distance learners across the state and beyond.
The Outreach School has nine regional centers across the state, with several on community college campuses, to give Wyoming residents access to a university education without relocating to Laramie.</p>
<p>The university is a hub of cultural events in Laramie.
It offers a variety of performing arts events, ranging from rock concerts in the Arena Auditorium to classical concerts and performances by the university's theater and dance department at the Fine Arts Center.
University of Wyoming offers many <a>extracurricular activities</a>, including over 200 student clubs and organizations that include a wide range of social, professional and academic groups.
<p><a>thumb|right|Old Main pictured in 1908</a>  On September 27, 1886 the cornerstone of Old Main was laid marking the beginning of the University of Wyoming.
The following year, the first class of 42 men and women began their college education.
For the next decade the building housed classrooms, a library and administration offices.</p>
The main stone used is rough-cut sandstone from a quarry east of Laramie and the trim stone is smooth Potsdam Sandstone from a quarry near Rawlins.
Old Main was designed to be a monumental structure and was designed to be a symmetrical building with a prominent central spire as the focal point.
The building was also designed to reflect the character of Wyoming and the rough stone and smooth trim represented the progressing frontier.
The design of Old Main had a lasting effect on university structures, which is most visible by the use of sandstone fa&#x00e7;ade on nearly every building.</p>
<p>In 1916, the central spire was removed due to structural concerns and the auditorium was reduced in size during a 1936 renovation.
In 1949, the building was thoroughly remodeled&#x2014;the auditorium and exterior stairs were completely removed.
It also became officially known as Old Main and the name was carved above the east entrance.
Currently, Old Main houses university administration including the President's Office and the board room where the Trustees often meet.</p>
<p>Prexy's Pasture is a large grassy area located within a ring of classroom and administrative buildings and serves as the center mall of the campus.
During the administration of <a>Arthur G. Crane</a> the name, &quot;Prexy's Pasture&quot;, was formally declared.
<p>When the University of Wyoming first opened its doors in 1887, Prexy's Pasture was nothing more than an actual pasture covered in native grasses.
Over time, as the needs of the university has changed, the area has been altered and redesigned.
The original design was established in 1924 and in 1949 the area was landscaped with <a>Blue Spruce</a> and <a>Mugo Pine</a>.
In February 1965, the Board of Trustees decided to construct the new science center on the west side of Prexy's Pasture.
The board president, Harold F. Newton, who was concerned about the location, leaked the decision to the local press.
The uproar that followed caused the board to decide on a new location for the science center and resulted in a new state statute making it necessary for any new structure built on the pasture to receive legislative approval.
The statue known as &quot;University of Wyoming Family,&quot; was installed in 1983 by UW Professor <a>Robert Russin</a> in anticipation of the centennial celebration.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, Prexy's Pasture was remodeled as the first step in a two part redesign project.
This step involved removing the asphalt roadway that circled the pasture and replacing it with concrete walkways to make the area a walking campus, as recommended by the 1966 and 1991 Campus Master Plans.
The second phase of the project involves the construction of a plaza at each corner featuring trees and rocks styled after the rocky outcrops of nearby Vedauwoo.
Also, outside of its primary use by students travelling to and from classes or socializing, the area is also host to campus <a>barbecue</a>s and fall welcome events.</p>
<p><a>thumb|upright|right|The west entrance of Wyoming Union</a> In September 1937, with the approval of the <a>Wyoming State Legislature</a>, President <a>Arthur G. Crane</a> obtained a Public Works Administration loan for $149,250 to be used for construction of a student union.
On March 3, 1938, ground was broken and construction began on what would become the Wyoming Union.
The formal and informal social needs were met by including a <a>ballroom</a>, banquet room, lounges, and game rooms.
One year after construction began, the Wyoming Union opened with its first <a>banquet</a> and ball.</p>
<p>The original design has been modified several times to accommodate changing needs and a growing student population.
The first addition was completed in January 1960.
This section, added to the northeast of the original structure, expanded the ballroom, created a lounge area and senate chambers adjacent to the ballroom, created the main lobby and <a>breezeway</a>, and provided a larger food area called The Gardens.
In 1973, an addition to the north was completed to create a <a>food court</a>, more space for the bookstore, and additional offices.
Also, parts of the original building were remodeled to create the Campus Activities Center, an art gallery, and a ticket outlet.
The $12 million project moved the food court to the main level, expanded the bookstore to the lower level, and revitalized the look and feel of the interior.</p>
<p>The original library at the University of Wyoming consisted of three hundred books and was located in Old Main.
In 1923, the library was moved to the new Aven Nelson Memorial Building.
These factors contributed to the decision by the board of trustees that it was necessary to construct a new library.
However, the 1951 state legislature rejected the funding request.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The main entrance to Coe Library</a> William Robertson Coe, a financier and philanthropist, came to the aid of president Humphrey in 1954 by contributing $750,000 in securities to the university.
The state legislature, in 1955, matched the Coe grant for an overall amount of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Laramie architects Eliot and Clinton Hitchcock, whose father had designed Aven Nelson, teamed up with the Porter and Porter firm in Cheyenne to design the new library.
Their modular design was popular at the time and intended to make the space very functional.
The layout provided room for over five hundred thousand books and seating for at least nine hundred students.
In May 1956, one year after the death of Coe, ground was broken and construction began on the building.
The William Robertson Coe library was finished in time for the Fall 1958 semester.
This structure, designed by Kellogg and Kellogg of Cheyenne and Rock Springs, almost doubled the shelf space of the original Coe Library.</p>
<p>The most recent renovation of the library was completed in the fall of 2009 and officially dedicated on November 19, 2009.
The new wing, referred to as Coe East, was designed by Hinthorne Mott Architects and adds  to the library.
The addition was part of a larger, $50 million project to modernize the library by integrating technology and information.
The renovation created an additional 20 group study rooms, space for 180 computer terminals and features art by <a>James Surls</a>.</p>
<p>The Classroom Building, dedicated in 1971 at a cost of $1.75 million, is designed to be a general purpose building for the university.
The placement and unique design, by the local architects W. Eliot and Clinton A. Hitchcock, makes it the focal point of the George Duke Humphrey Science Center.
The building also contains four interior mosaics, designed by UW art professors James Boyle, Joseph Deaderick, Richard Evans and Victor Flach, that represent the quadrant of Wyoming they face.
In 2007, after a two year $14.7 million renovation project, the classroom building reopened.
The goal of the renovation was to incorporate new technology and redesign the seating to better meet the needs of students who carry laptops and backpacks.
The unique characteristics of the original building, such as the circular design and mosaics were maintained.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Washakie Dining Center and McIntyre Hall</a> The University has six residence halls and three apartment complexes.
Crane Hall, named after Arthur G. Crane, is reserved for students of sophomore standing and above and is configured with almost all single occupancy rooms.</p>
Downey Hall is an eight-story tall dormitory located southwest of the Washakie Dining Center and is named after Dr. June Etta Downey.
Located west of the Washakie Dining Center is the twelve-story dormitory known as White Hall, which is named after Dr. Laura Amanda White.
McIntyre Hall named after Dr. Clara Frances McIntyre, is located east of the Washakie Dining Center.
It is also the tallest building in Wyoming.
<p><a>thumb|upright|right|The University of Wyoming Geological Museum</a> The University of Wyoming is home to several facilities that allow the public to view unique collections.
It is one of the largest non-governmental archives west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.
Officially established in 1945, it now contains nearly  of historic documents and artifacts.
It is also home to the Toppan Library, which contains 55,000 rare books.
<p>The Geological Museum houses a collection of fossils and minerals with special focus on the history of Wyoming.
When the University of Wyoming was founded, the museum was nothing more than a small personal collection of the professor J.D. Conley.
In 1893, Wilbur Knight, who was hired as a professor of mining and geology, took over as the museum curator.
In 1902, the museum was moved to the Hall of Science and continued to expand.
When the collection was moved to its current location in 1956, Wilbur Knight's son Samuel Howell Knight, who was voted to be Wyoming's &quot;Citizen of the Century&quot; in 1999, had made the Geology Department famous around the country.
S.H Knight is responsible for many of the exhibits and paintings that are still on display, including the copper <a>Tyrannosaurus</a> at the entrance, the initial mounting of the <a>Apatosaurus</a> skeleton centerpiece and the <a>terracotta</a> <a>Stegosaurus</a> and <a>Triceratops</a> panels.
One of the most famous exhibits at the museum is the <a>Allosaurus</a> known as, <a>Big Al</a>, which was featured in the BBC documentary, <em><a>The Ballad of Big Al</a></em>.
The University of Wyoming Geological Museum has also received coverage from National Geographic, CNN, Earth Magazine, Walter Cronkite, NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw and has been shown on many dinosaur programs.
<p>The <a>College of Agriculture</a> and Natural Resources offers state-of-the-art teaching, research labs and field environments, and an indoor livestock teaching arena.
<p><a>thumb|right|The University of Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO)</a> The <a>College of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> offers more than 50 majors, 60 minors, and seven interdisciplinary programs.
<p>The <a>College of Business</a> is one of fewer than 15% of all business schools worldwide to be fully accredited at the undergraduate and graduate levels by AACSB.
Partnerships with Wyoming public schools provide a structure for students to gain hands-on experience in real classrooms, and the on-campus lab school provides a model of teaching and learning.
The College of Education boasts a strong history of quality graduates, high employment rates, and satisfaction among hiring districts.</p>
UW engineering seniors consistently score above the national average on their first licensing exam, which is in part due to Power Groups which allow freshmen to select common course schedules with students of similar interests.</p>
