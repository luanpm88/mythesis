Agnes Scott's campus lies in downtown <a>Decatur</a>, <a>Georgia</a>, nestled inside the perimeter of the bustling metro-<a>Atlanta</a> area.
The college was founded in 1889 as <strong>Decatur Female Seminary</strong> by Presbyterian minister Frank H. Gaines.
In 1890, the name was changed to <strong>Agnes Scott Institute</strong> to honor the mother of the college's primary benefactor, Col. <a>George Washington Scott</a>.
The name was changed again to <strong>Agnes Scott College</strong> in 1906, and remains today a <a>liberal arts</a> <a>women's college</a>.</p>
<p>Agnes Scott is affiliated with the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>, and is considered one of the <a>Seven Sisters of the South</a>.
The current mission of the college, adopted in 2002, states: <em>Agnes Scott College educates women to think deeply, live honorably and engage the intellectual and social challenges of their times.</em>

<p>The <a>honor code</a> is held in high regard among Agnes Scott students and faculty.
At the beginning of every academic year, new students must sign the honor code and recite a pledge promising to uphold the high academic and social standards of the institution.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>:&quot;As a member of the student body of Agnes Scott College, I consider myself bound by honor to develop and uphold high standards of honesty and behavior; to strive for full intellectual and moral stature; to realize my social and academic responsibility in the community.
To attain these ideals, I do therefore accept this Honor System as my way of life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Students self govern themselves and ask violators of the code to turn themselves in to Honor Court.
The trust the Honor Code builds between faculty and students allows for students to take self scheduled, unproctored, exams.</p>
