<h2>History</h2>
<p>The charter of the University of Dallas dates from 1910 when priests from the <a>Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> took that name for the <a>Holy Trinity College</a> they had founded five years earlier.
Holy Trinity closed in 1928 and the charter was placed with the <a>Catholic</a> <a>Diocese of Dallas</a>.
In 1955 the Western Province of the <a>Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur</a> obtained it for the purpose of operating a new institution in Dallas that would absorb their junior college in <a>Fort Worth</a>, Our Lady of Victory.
The Sisters, together with laymen <a>Eugene Constantin, Jr.</a> and <a>Edward R. Maher, Sr.</a>, induced <a>Bishop</a> <a>Thomas Kiely Gorman</a> to have the diocese assume sponsorship of the institution with ownership by its Board of Trustees.
<a>thumb|left|Carpenter Hall, the first building on the campus of the University of Dallas</a>Bishop Gorman announced that the University would be a four-year co-educational institution welcoming students of all faiths and races, and offering work on the undergraduate level with a graduate school to be added as soon as practicable.The University opened its doors to 96 degree-seeking students in September 1956, on a  tract of rolling hills northwest of the city of Dallas now part of Irving/Las Colinas.</p>
<p>Members of the <a>Cistercian Order</a> and the Sisters of Saint Mary, together with three <a>Franciscan</a> fathers and a number of laymen, comprised the original faculty of the University of Dallas.
Dominican priests joined the faculty in 1958 and established <a>Albert the Great Priory</a>.
The <a>School Sisters of Notre Dame</a> came in 1962.
The Cistercians established a permanent abbey, church and an outstanding college preparatory school.The faculty has become largely lay and counts numerous distinguished scholars among its members.
Accreditation by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> came in 1963 and has been reaffirmed regularly.
In November 1996 the University was the first institution accredited by the <a>American Academy of Liberal Education</a>.
Significant honors have been won by University graduates since the first class in 1960 earned <a>Fulbright</a> and <a>Woodrow Wilson</a> awards for graduate studies.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The UD mall, with the Braniff Tower in the background</a>The school is located on a 744 acre (3&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) suburban campus in <a>Irving, Texas</a>, 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from downtown <a>Dallas</a>.
<p>A light rail station operated by DART is scheduled to open within  of campus in December 2010.
<p>The University started its Rome Program in 1970.
The  Program is a semester abroad in which (generally) sophomores spend a semester in Rome.
Since the Constantin College's Core Curriculum (see the section below entitled Academics:Undergraduate)&lt;!-- I would have used a link here, but I couldn't find in Help how to do a link internal to the page, referencing Heading levels :-( --&gt; means that most students take the same courses in the first two years, the University is able to offer the same courses in Rome that the students would have taken in the U.S. - thus, the semester abroad results in no delay towards the B.A. degree.</p>
<p>The University has had its campus at a number of locations over the years.
It was first at a Notre Dame convent in 1970-1971.
By 1972, the campus was in the &quot;International Center&quot;, a sprawling complex on the Via della Pisana outside the <a>Grande Raccordo Anulare (G.R.A.)</a>.
In the spring of 1973 in mid-semester, the school moved its campus to &quot;Hotel La Villa&quot;, a hotel that catered to tour groups, which had a separate set of buildings that the University used, complete with dining area, kitchen, classrooms, offices, dorm rooms, apartments (for the faculty), and a common area.
This campus was at Via del Pescaccio, 103, just inside the G.R.A., about halfway between the Via della Pisana and the Via Aurelia.
The school's campus is now a convent.</p>
<p>In 1990, the University purchased a villa southeast of Rome in the <em>Castelli Romani</em>, the <a>Alban Hills</a> of ancient Roman history and legend.
This campus was purchased to serve as the base of the <a>University of Dallas Rome Program</a>.
In June 1994, the newly renovated  property was inaugurated as the Eugene Constantin Rome Campus, and that fall it hosted its first students.
Just south of Rome along the <a>Via Appia</a>, the campus includes a library, chapel, housing, a dining hall, classrooms, tennis courts, a swimming pool, an outdoor Greco-Roman theater, a <em>forno</em> (a traditional outdoor wood-burning oven), working vineyards and olive groves.</p>
These requirements change from year to year depending upon the size of the incoming freshman class, for instance in 2009 all students with senior credit standing were required to live off campus.</p>
All undergraduate students at the University of Dallas study a <a>Core Curriculum</a>, a series of specific courses that emphasizes the great ideas, deeds, and works of <a>Western civilization</a> from classical to modern times.</p>
<p>The core curriculum includes four classes in literary tradition (Epic Poetry, Lyrical Poetry, The Play (comedy and tragedy), and The Novel; four classes in history (two American and two Western Civilization); four philosophy (Philosophy and the Ethical Life, Philosophy of Man, Philosophy of Being and a Philosophy elective); two fine arts and one math, or one fine art and two maths.
<p>The required Core Curriculum of all undergraduate students is intended to provide a academic foundation for those considering law school.
The <a>Socratic Method</a> of instruction, employed in many undergraduate seminars, as well as the emphasis on critical reading and analytic writing, has allowed UD students to excel on the <a>LSAT</a> exam and embark upon successful legal careers.
The University has seen its students accepted into the very highest cadre of law schools including those at <a>Yale</a>, <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Chicago</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>USC</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, <a>Virginia</a>, <a>SMU</a>, <a>Catholic University</a>, <a>Georgetown</a>, <a>Washington and Lee School of Law</a> and the <a>University of Texas</a>.</p>
<p>The University has a rigorous pre-med program that has seen its students accepted at institutions such as <a>UT Southwestern Medical School</a>, <a>Baylor College of Medicine</a>, and the <a>University of Virginia School of Medicine</a>.

<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions launched UD Underground in Fall 2007 to explain what it is like to be an undergraduate student at the university.
It utilizes student photos, blogs, videos, and a &quot;UD Dictionary&quot; to show prospective students examples of student life at the University of Dallas.</p>
<p>In 2001, the entire full-time staff of the Institute for Religious and Pastoral Studies (IRPS) program, including the director Douglas Bushman and associate director Timothy Herrman and David Twellman, resigned and moved to <a>Ave Maria College</a> Then <a>Bishop</a> of Dallas <a>Charles V. Grahmann</a> called the departure a &quot;blessing.&quot;
According to Grahmann, the Institute's then administrators had become, &quot;advocates of an ideal orthodoxy and built walls that no one could penetrate.&quot;
Since that time, the IRPS, under the direction of Dean Brian Schmisek, has been renamed the School of Ministry and has become larger than it was in 2001 when the entire staff resigned.
