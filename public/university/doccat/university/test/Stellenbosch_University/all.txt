established$$$@@@%%%<p>Stellenbosch University designed and manufactured Africa's first microsatellite, <a>SUNSAT</a>, launched in 1999.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Students are nicknamed <em>Maties</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%Some claim the term arises from their maroon <a>rugby</a> colours: a <em>tamatie</em> is the <a>Afrikaans</a> translation for tomato.
established$$$@@@%%%It is more likely to come from the Afrikaans colloquialism <em>maat</em> (meaning &quot;buddy&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;) originally used diminutively by the students of the <a>University of Cape Town</a>'s precursor, the <a>South African College</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The origin of the university can be traced back to the <strong>Stellenbosch Gymnasium</strong>, which was opened on 1 March 1866 , which became the <strong>Stellenbosch College</strong> in 1881 and which was located at the current Arts Department.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1887 this college was renamed <strong><a>Victoria</a> College</strong>; when it acquired university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again - to <strong>Stellenbosch University</strong>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Name</h2>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Both descriptions, <strong>University of Stellenbosch</strong> and <strong>Stellenbosch University</strong> are correct, although the latter more informal format should be used in marketing and communication activities.
mascot$$$@@@%%%This also holds true for the corresponding Afrikaans versions of the name, <strong>Universiteit van Stellenbosch</strong> and <strong>Universiteit Stellenbosch</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%Some departments favour one over the other, for example, <strong>the <a>University of Stellenbosch Business School</a></strong>, which is regularly shortened to <strong><a>USB</a></strong>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Ranking</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> According to the University of Leiden&#x2019;s ranking, SU ranked 454th out of the top 500 universities worldwide in terms of international publication output and 415th in terms of the impact of citations from SU scientific publications in 2007.
type$$$@@@%%%This is one of the most reliable rankings in respect of research but it does not attempt to rank universities in a comprehensive sense.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>University of Stellenbosch Business School</a> (USB) was ranked 39 out of the 100 leading business schools in the world, according to the Aspen Institute&#x2019;s 2009-10 edition of its alternative Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The USB is also the only business school not only in South Africa but also the rest of the continent to be included in the Top 100 list.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2009 <a>Webometrics</a> ranked Stellenbosch 3rd in Africa behind the <a>University of Cape Town</a> and <a>University of Pretoria</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Location</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|upright|View over the &quot;Red Square&quot; of Stellenbosch University with the peak,&quot;The Twins&quot; beyond</a> <a>Stellenbosch</a>, South Africa's oldest town after Cape Town, is a university town with a population of about 90,000 (excluding students).
established$$$@@@%%%It is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town and is situated on the banks of the <em>Eersterivier</em> (&quot;First River&quot;) in the famous wine-growing region and is encircled by picturesque mountains.
established$$$@@@%%%Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main Stellenbosch campus, the Tygerberg campus, where the Faculty of Health Sciences is situated, the <a>Bellville Park</a> campus, where the graduate School of Business is, and the <a>Saldanha</a> campus, housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Language</h2>
affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p>Stellenbosch University is a predominantly <a>Afrikaans</a> medium university, especially at undergraduate and honours course level.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%However, students are allowed to write their assignments, tests and examinations in both English and Afrikaans.
country$$$@@@%%%The language of tuition also varies depending on the faculty, with the Arts faculty for example being 40% English, most if not all courses are lectured bilingually and the language of most handouts or prescribed material is determined by the student.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition of the class.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%The majority of advanced postgraduate courses are conducted in English.
established$$$@@@%%%According to the current<img> language profile of the university, 60% of its students state Afrikaans as their home language, 32% have English as their home language, whilst only 1.6% of students have <a>Xhosa</a> as their home language.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The language policy is still an ongoing issue for the University, since it is one of the very few tertiary institutions left in South Africa offering tuition in Afrikaans.
established$$$@@@%%%Because of this, it is held in very high regard by the Afrikaner community, with the university even being considered a central pillar of Afrikaner life.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Most other institutions have always been English or have changed over time to an English-only policy.</p>
