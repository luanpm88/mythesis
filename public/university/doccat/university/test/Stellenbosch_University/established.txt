<p> <a>thumb|The <em>Ou Hoofgebou</em> (former main administration building) on Stellenbosch University campus</a> <strong>Stellenbosch University</strong> (formally <em>University of Stellenbosch</em>/) is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> situated in the town of <a>Stellenbosch</a>, South Africa.
<p>Stellenbosch University designed and manufactured Africa's first microsatellite, <a>SUNSAT</a>, launched in 1999.</p>
Some claim the term arises from their maroon <a>rugby</a> colours: a <em>tamatie</em> is the <a>Afrikaans</a> translation for tomato.
It is more likely to come from the Afrikaans colloquialism <em>maat</em> (meaning &quot;buddy&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;) originally used diminutively by the students of the <a>University of Cape Town</a>'s precursor, the <a>South African College</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of the university can be traced back to the <strong>Stellenbosch Gymnasium</strong>, which was opened on 1 March 1866 , which became the <strong>Stellenbosch College</strong> in 1881 and which was located at the current Arts Department.
In 1887 this college was renamed <strong><a>Victoria</a> College</strong>; when it acquired university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again - to <strong>Stellenbosch University</strong>.</p>
Some departments favour one over the other, for example, <strong>the <a>University of Stellenbosch Business School</a></strong>, which is regularly shortened to <strong><a>USB</a></strong>.</p>
<p> According to the University of Leiden&#x2019;s ranking, SU ranked 454th out of the top 500 universities worldwide in terms of international publication output and 415th in terms of the impact of citations from SU scientific publications in 2007.
<p>The <a>University of Stellenbosch Business School</a> (USB) was ranked 39 out of the 100 leading business schools in the world, according to the Aspen Institute&#x2019;s 2009-10 edition of its alternative Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey.
<p>In 2009 <a>Webometrics</a> ranked Stellenbosch 3rd in Africa behind the <a>University of Cape Town</a> and <a>University of Pretoria</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|upright|View over the &quot;Red Square&quot; of Stellenbosch University with the peak,&quot;The Twins&quot; beyond</a> <a>Stellenbosch</a>, South Africa's oldest town after Cape Town, is a university town with a population of about 90,000 (excluding students).
It is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town and is situated on the banks of the <em>Eersterivier</em> (&quot;First River&quot;) in the famous wine-growing region and is encircled by picturesque mountains.
Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main Stellenbosch campus, the Tygerberg campus, where the Faculty of Health Sciences is situated, the <a>Bellville Park</a> campus, where the graduate School of Business is, and the <a>Saldanha</a> campus, housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force.</p>
<p>At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition of the class.
According to the current<img> language profile of the university, 60% of its students state Afrikaans as their home language, 32% have English as their home language, whilst only 1.6% of students have <a>Xhosa</a> as their home language.</p>
<p>The language policy is still an ongoing issue for the University, since it is one of the very few tertiary institutions left in South Africa offering tuition in Afrikaans.
Because of this, it is held in very high regard by the Afrikaner community, with the university even being considered a central pillar of Afrikaner life.
