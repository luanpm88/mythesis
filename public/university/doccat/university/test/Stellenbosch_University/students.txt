The library has collections scattered around the campus outside of the main facility, and all of which are catalogued on a computerised database, using the university's original mainframe, a <a>UNIVAC</a>.
An official yearbook, <em>Die Stellenbosch Student</em>, is published annually and presented to all graduating students.
