established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|The Venn Building</a> The foundation stone of <strong>University College Hull</strong>, then an external college of the <a>University of London</a>, was laid in 1927 by the <a>Duke of York</a> (who later became <a>George VI</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%It was built on land donated by <a>Hull City Council</a> and local benefactors <a>Thomas Ferens</a> and <a>G F Grant</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students.
established$$$@@@%%%The college at that time consisted of one building, the Venn building (named after the mathematician <a>John Venn</a>, who was born in Hull).
established$$$@@@%%%The building is the administration centre of the university</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The original university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The symbols are the torch for learning, the rose for Yorkshire, the ducal coronet from the arms of the City of Hull, the fleur-de-lys for Lincolnshire and the dove, symbolising peace, from the arms of Thomas Ferens.
established$$$@@@%%%These symbols have later been reused to create the modern university logo.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h3>Royal Charter</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college gained its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1954, which empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the third university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England.
established$$$@@@%%%The Brynmor Jones Library was constructed in 1960, with a tower block extension added in 1970.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 1960s more academic buildings were added, with their height diminishing from the centre of the campus towards the perimeter, a barrier which the university was quickly outgrowing.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Liquid crystal technology</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1972 <a>George Gray</a> and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable <a>liquid crystal</a>s in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products.
established$$$@@@%%%This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the <a>Queen's Award for Technological Achievement</a> for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made <a>liquid crystal display</a>s possible.

free$$$@@@%%%<h3>Department closure</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Coming soon after a large expansion of the university by breadth of courses and physical size with the HYMS campus, in 2005, the university decided to close its maths department.
established$$$@@@%%%This was due to a 'reduction in funding' and general shortage in UK maths undergraduates.
established$$$@@@%%%Four other UK university maths departments had closed since 1999.
established$$$@@@%%%The department taught around 175 students, and the department's staff moved to the University of York.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Centre for Mathematics replaced the department.
