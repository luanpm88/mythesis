<p> The <strong>University of Hull</strong>, also known as <strong>Hull University</strong>, is an <a>English</a> <a>university</a>, founded in 1927, located in <a>Hull</a>, a city in the <a>East Riding of Yorkshire</a>.
Though classed as a provincial or &quot;<a>redbrick university</a>&quot;, its expansion in recent decades has seen the addition of a variety of building styles from the traditional main buildings, 1960s teaching blocks to modern 'state-of-the-art' additions.
The University has a smaller campus in <a>Scarborough</a> on the <a>North Yorkshire</a> coast.
It is a partner in the proposed University Centre of <a>Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education</a> in North East Lincolnshire.
The main campus is home to the <a>Hull York Medical School</a>, a joint initiative with the <a>University of York</a>.</p>
<p>The University's <a>Brynmor Jones Library</a> was the workplace of the <a>poet</a> <a>Philip Larkin</a> who served as its Head Librarian for thirty years.
The <a>Philip Larkin Society</a> organises activities in remembrance of Larkin including the <a>Larkin 25</a> festival which was organised during 2010 in partnership with the University.
The Library was also the workplace of former <a>poet laureate</a> <a>Andrew Motion</a> and the late film director <a>Anthony Minghella</a>.
<a>Lord Wilberforce</a> was chancellor of the University from 1978 until 1994.
<a>Robert Armstrong</a> was chancellor from 1994 to 2006.
<a>Virginia Bottomley</a> was installed as the current chancellor in April 2006.
They include former MP and Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott of Kingston-upon-Hull (<a>John Prescott</a>), social scientist Lord <a>Anthony Giddens</a>, poet <a>Roger McGough</a>, author <a>John McCarthy (journalist)</a>, politician and author <a>Chris Mullin</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Venn Building</a> The foundation stone of <strong>University College Hull</strong>, then an external college of the <a>University of London</a>, was laid in 1927 by the <a>Duke of York</a> (who later became <a>George VI</a>).
It was built on land donated by <a>Hull City Council</a> and local benefactors <a>Thomas Ferens</a> and <a>G F Grant</a>.
A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students.
The college at that time consisted of one building, the Venn building (named after the mathematician <a>John Venn</a>, who was born in Hull).
The building is the administration centre of the university</p>
<p>The original university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928.
These symbols have later been reused to create the modern university logo.</p>
<p>The college gained its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1954, which empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the third university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England.
The Brynmor Jones Library was constructed in 1960, with a tower block extension added in 1970.
During the 1960s more academic buildings were added, with their height diminishing from the centre of the campus towards the perimeter, a barrier which the university was quickly outgrowing.</p>
<p>In 1972 <a>George Gray</a> and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable <a>liquid crystal</a>s in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products.
This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the <a>Queen's Award for Technological Achievement</a> for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made <a>liquid crystal display</a>s possible.
<p>In 2000 the university bought the site of <a>University College Scarborough</a> on Filey Road, Scarborough to become the <a>University of Hull Scarborough Campus</a>.
The university then further expanded in 2003, when it purchased the buildings of the adjacent <a>University of Lincoln</a> campus which, from the 2005 academic year, became the west campus of the university.
The site now houses the <a>Hull York Medical School</a> and the recently relocated business school, which is housed in three buildings - Wharfe, Derwent and Esk.</p>
<p>Coming soon after a large expansion of the university by breadth of courses and physical size with the HYMS campus, in 2005, the university decided to close its maths department.
This was due to a 'reduction in funding' and general shortage in UK maths undergraduates.
Four other UK university maths departments had closed since 1999.
The department taught around 175 students, and the department's staff moved to the University of York.
<p>Until recently, there were two faculties, the 'Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Technology' and the 'Faculty of Science &amp; the Environment'.
The chemistry department is noted for its research record as well as Hull's computer science and videogame developing degrees.</p>
<p>Most social science and law-related department housed in the refurbished Wilberforce Building.
Includes the School of Arts and New Media at Scarborough, formed in August 2006.
<h3>Health and Social Care (FHSC)</h3>
<p>Based in the Calder, Aire and Dearne buildings in the west campus (former campus of universities of Humberside, then finally Lincoln).
<p>Began in October 2003 on the west campus.
Includes the 'International Society for the Study of Cough' based at Castle Hill hospital on <em>Castle Road</em> in Cottingham.
Third and fourth year students train also at hospitals in <a>Scunthorpe</a>, <a>Grimsby</a>, and <a>Scarborough</a>.</p>
This became University College  Scarborough, then the Scarborough campus.</li>
<p>Established in 1994.
One of the PGMI's sections is the Yorkshire Cancer Research-funded <a>Centre for Magnetic Resonance Investigations</a> which, under the directorship of <a>Professor</a> Lindsay W. Turnbull, is actively engaged in researching the application of <a>magnetic resonance imaging</a> and <a>magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a> techniques to <a>cancer</a> research.</p>
<p>Established in August 1999 it has 2,300 students at the Hull and Scarborough campuses.
New &#x00a3;9m premises in 2005 on the West Campus.
The Business School could be classed as one large department, but it is so large and cannot fit in another category, so it is a standalone faculty.
The new &#x00a3;9 million Logistics Institute was completed in September 2007 .
The business school has both EQUIS and AMBA accreditations.
It is important to note that there is also the Scarborough management centre in addition to the facilities on the Hull campus.</p>
<p>The Wilberforce Institute for the study of slavery and emancipation (WISE) is located in Oriel Chambers on the High Street in Hull's Old Town, adjacent to <a>Wilberforce House</a>.
It undertakes graduate research in the field of slavery and human rights and offers an MA in slavery Studies.
WISE draws upon the university's academic expertise in history, law and social sciences.
<p>The University's Maritime Historical Studies Centre offers a BSc in History and Maritime History, an online Diploma in Maritime History and PhD research in maritime history is also located in the Hull's Old Town in <a>Blaydes House</a>.</p>
<p>The 'Hull History Centre', which opened in 2010, is located in a new building on Worship Street in Hull city centre.
It unites the holdings of Hull City Library's Local Studies collections and Hull University's archives and is run in partnership between the City Library and University Library.</p>

In 2010, the university was a partner organisation in the <a>Larkin 25</a> festival marking 25 years since the former librarian died.
The festival included a public art exhibition, 'Larkin with Toads' in Hull and other locations in the <a>East Riding of Yorkshire</a>.
In July 2010, former English lecturer at the University of Hull, Sir <a>Andrew Motion</a> named a Hull city bus &quot;Philip Larkin&quot;.
One of the Larkin with Toads statues was mounted at the University campus as part of the Larkin trail.</p>
