established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Erskine College</strong> is a four year, <a>Christian</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Due West, South Carolina</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Established by the Associate Reformed Synod of the South as an academy for men, Erskine College became the first four year, church-related college in <a>South Carolina</a> in 1839.
established$$$@@@%%%It was named for <a>Ebenezer Erskine</a>, one of the founders of the <a>Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church</a> and a <a>pastor</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Erskine had led a group of separatists from the <a>Church of Scotland</a> to found a separate Associate <a>Presbytery</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Also in 1839 was the formation of the <a>Euphemian Literary Society</a>, one of four literary societies at Erskine College.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%This society still exists at Erskine today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While the <a>college</a> has always employed a Professor of Divinity, its theological branch became a distinct but affiliated school, the <a>Erskine Theological Seminary</a>, in 1858.
established$$$@@@%%%Erskine began to admit women in 1894 and officially became <a>coeducational</a> in 1899.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1927, it merged with Women's College of Due West, founded in 1859.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1929, <a>Bryson College</a> closed and merged with Erskine College.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college adopted a Mission Statement in May 1991: &quot;Erskine exists to prepare persons for responsible living, service, and ministry, in both Church and society.
established$$$@@@%%%As a community devoted to Christian commitment and excellence in learning, Erskine accomplishes its mission through undergraduate liberal arts and graduate theological education.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1995, the college banned alcohol (see <a>dry campus</a>) from the campus and later implemented changes which require all students under the age of 21 to reside in on-campus housing, unless proof of residence with a blood relative was provided.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1999, Rev. John Carson became <a>president</a> of the college.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Upon his installation he noted: &quot;I do not intend to add anything new, not one new straw on the backs of faculty or staff or students,&quot; Carson said.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;But I do intend to be consistent in making this vision a reality.
established$$$@@@%%%Erskine College will be, by God's grace, what it has been called to be--a Christian liberal arts college open to all students.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. <a>Randall T. Ruble</a> was voted in as the President of Erskine College and Seminary on October 26, <a>2006</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%He was inaugurated April 10, 2007.</p>
