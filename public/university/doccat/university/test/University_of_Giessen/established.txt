<p>The <strong>University of Gie&#x00df;en</strong> is officially called the <strong><em>Justus Liebig University Giessen</em></strong> (German: <em>Justus Liebig-Universit&#x00e4;t Gie&#x00df;en</em>) after its most famous faculty member, <a>Justus von Liebig</a>, the founder of modern agricultural chemistry and inventor of artificial fertiliser.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Gie&#x00df;en is among the oldest institutions of higher educations in the German-speaking world.
It was founded in 1607 as a <a>Lutheran</a> university in the city of <a>Gie&#x00df;en</a> in <a>Hesse-Darmstadt</a> because the all-Hessian <em>Landesuniversit&#x00e4;t</em> (the nearby <a>University of Marburg</a> (<em>Philipps-Universit&#x00e4;t Marburg</em>) in <a>Marburg</a>, <a>Hesse-Kassel</a> (or Hesse-Cassel)) had become Reformed (that is, <a>Calvinist</a>).
Landgrave Ludwig V von Hessen-Darmstadt, whence the university got its original name &quot;Ludoviciana,&quot; founded his own institution of higher education in Gie&#x00df;en, which as a Lutheran institution had the primary function of ensuring the education of priests and bureaucrats.
Endowed with a charter issued by Kaiser Rudolf II on May 19, 1607, the university was allowed to proceed with instruction in October of 1607.
During the Thirty Years War, when Hessen-Darmstadt was able to take the area around Marburg for itself, the university in Gie&#x00df;en ceased instruction and was moved back to its more long-standing location in Marburg (1624/25).
The Peace of Westfallia led to the restoration of the old location and in 1650 to the relocation of the university to Gie&#x00df;en.
<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries the Ludoviciana was a typical small state university that then had the four common faculties (theology, law, medicine, and philosophy).
The instruction was reasonable, with about 20 to 25 professors teaching several hundred students, the latter of which were mostly &quot;Landeskinder.&quot;
In the 18th century came gradual modernization of the curricula and reforms in the instruction, which were definitively influenced by the local lordly court in Darmstadt.
The example for the reforms were both of the &quot;model universities of the Enlightenment,&quot; the University of Halle, founded in 1694, and more still Georgia Augusta, founded in G&#x00f6;ttingen in 1734/37.
Indeed, all attempts at reform were from the start limited by the limited finances of Hessen-Darmstadt.
The noteworthy creation of a faculty of economics (1777-1785) was ultimately was born out of this financial hardship.
In the faculty of economics new practical subjects were brought together (veterinary medicine, forestry, and cameral sciences), which the university was supposed to make &quot;expedient&quot; and &quot;profitable.&quot;
After finishing studies in this faculty, a number of these youths were able to gain recognition in the faculties of medicine and philosophy.
They established the unusually diverse course offerings that continue to exist to the modern day at the University of Gie&#x00df;en.
<p>The University of Gie&#x00df;en weathered the transition from the 18th to the 19th century unscathed and was still the only university of an enlarged territory, the Grand-duchy of Hessen.
Alongside Jena, Gie&#x00df;en was the prototype for the politicized Vorm&#x00e4;rz university, and the &quot;Gie&#x00df;ener Schwarzen&quot; with Karl Follen and Georg B&#x00fc;chner marked the revolutionary spirit of this decade.
With the appointment of the 21 year old <a>Justus von Liebig</a> in 1824 through the Grand Duchy&#x2014;against the will of the university on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt&#x2014;a new era in the natural sciences began, not only in Gie&#x00df;en.
Young, promising scientists created a new impulse in their respective areas of knowledge; among these scientists were the antiquarian Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, the lawyer Rudolf von Jhreing, the theologian Adolf von Harnack, and the physicist Wilhelm Conrad R&#x00f6;ntgen.
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, the Ludoviciana began to expand into a modern university.
During this period, new clinics in human and veterinary medicine were established, and the university library received its first proper building.
With the creation of the university's central building (inaugurated 1880) and the adjacent newly constructed facilities for chemistry and physics a new cultural center was established on what was then the border of the city.
The decisive backer of this project was the last Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, to whom the university bestowed out of thankfulness the honorary title of &quot;Rector Magnificentissimus.&quot;
For the first time included in the student body were women, who since 1900 were admitted as guest students and starting in 1908 were admitted for regular study.
The University of Gie&#x00df;en now has almost 23,000 students and 8,500 employees, which together with the <a>University of Applied Sciences Giessen-Friedberg</a>, makes Gie&#x00df;en the most student-dominated German city.</p>
<p>In the 2009 winter semester the student population exceeded the mark of more than a total of 24,000 students and 4500 first-semester students for the first time.
<p>Although the university has no defined campus, buildings and facilities are grouped together according to their subject areas and situated in various locations around Gie&#x00df;en. Philosophikum II, for example is an area on the outskirts of the city bordering the city forest.

<p>Next to Liebig, famous professors at the university included the <a>theologian</a> <a>Adolf von Harnack</a>, the <a>lawyer</a> <a>Rudolf von Jhering</a>, <a>Frank-Walter Steinmeier</a> former foreign secretary of Germany, the <a>economist</a> and <a>statistician</a> <a>Etienne Laspeyres</a>, the <a>physicist</a> <a>Wilhelm Conrad R&#x00f6;ntgen</a>, the <a>mathematician</a>s <a>Moritz Pasch</a> and <a>Alfred Clebsch</a>, the <a>gestalt psychologist</a> <a>Kurt Koffka</a>, the <a>philologist</a> and <a>archaeologist</a> <a>Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker</a>, and the orientalist <a>Eberhard Schrader</a>.
They include the German romantic dramatist and revolutionary <a>Georg B&#x00fc;chner</a>, the literary and political <a>historian</a> <a>Georg Gottfried Gervinus</a> and the <a>botanist</a> <a>Johann Jacob Dillenius</a>.</p>
<p>The Holocaust Literature Research Unit of the university plans to publish <a>My Opposition</a>, <a>Friedrich Kellner</a>'s World War II diary.
Friedrich Kellner was chief justice inspector in Laubach from 1933 to 1950 and also district auditor for the region of Gie&#x00df;en.</p>
