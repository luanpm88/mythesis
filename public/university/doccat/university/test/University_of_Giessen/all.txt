established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Gie&#x00df;en</strong> is officially called the <strong><em>Justus Liebig University Giessen</em></strong> (German: <em>Justus Liebig-Universit&#x00e4;t Gie&#x00df;en</em>) after its most famous faculty member, <a>Justus von Liebig</a>, the founder of modern agricultural chemistry and inventor of artificial fertiliser.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Gie&#x00df;en is among the oldest institutions of higher educations in the German-speaking world.
established$$$@@@%%%It was founded in 1607 as a <a>Lutheran</a> university in the city of <a>Gie&#x00df;en</a> in <a>Hesse-Darmstadt</a> because the all-Hessian <em>Landesuniversit&#x00e4;t</em> (the nearby <a>University of Marburg</a> (<em>Philipps-Universit&#x00e4;t Marburg</em>) in <a>Marburg</a>, <a>Hesse-Kassel</a> (or Hesse-Cassel)) had become Reformed (that is, <a>Calvinist</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%Landgrave Ludwig V von Hessen-Darmstadt, whence the university got its original name &quot;Ludoviciana,&quot; founded his own institution of higher education in Gie&#x00df;en, which as a Lutheran institution had the primary function of ensuring the education of priests and bureaucrats.
established$$$@@@%%%Endowed with a charter issued by Kaiser Rudolf II on May 19, 1607, the university was allowed to proceed with instruction in October of 1607.
established$$$@@@%%%During the Thirty Years War, when Hessen-Darmstadt was able to take the area around Marburg for itself, the university in Gie&#x00df;en ceased instruction and was moved back to its more long-standing location in Marburg (1624/25).
established$$$@@@%%%The Peace of Westfallia led to the restoration of the old location and in 1650 to the relocation of the university to Gie&#x00df;en.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries the Ludoviciana was a typical small state university that then had the four common faculties (theology, law, medicine, and philosophy).
established$$$@@@%%%The instruction was reasonable, with about 20 to 25 professors teaching several hundred students, the latter of which were mostly &quot;Landeskinder.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In the 18th century came gradual modernization of the curricula and reforms in the instruction, which were definitively influenced by the local lordly court in Darmstadt.
established$$$@@@%%%The example for the reforms were both of the &quot;model universities of the Enlightenment,&quot; the University of Halle, founded in 1694, and more still Georgia Augusta, founded in G&#x00f6;ttingen in 1734/37.
established$$$@@@%%%Indeed, all attempts at reform were from the start limited by the limited finances of Hessen-Darmstadt.
established$$$@@@%%%The noteworthy creation of a faculty of economics (1777-1785) was ultimately was born out of this financial hardship.
established$$$@@@%%%In the faculty of economics new practical subjects were brought together (veterinary medicine, forestry, and cameral sciences), which the university was supposed to make &quot;expedient&quot; and &quot;profitable.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%After finishing studies in this faculty, a number of these youths were able to gain recognition in the faculties of medicine and philosophy.
established$$$@@@%%%They established the unusually diverse course offerings that continue to exist to the modern day at the University of Gie&#x00df;en.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Gie&#x00df;en weathered the transition from the 18th to the 19th century unscathed and was still the only university of an enlarged territory, the Grand-duchy of Hessen.
established$$$@@@%%%Alongside Jena, Gie&#x00df;en was the prototype for the politicized Vorm&#x00e4;rz university, and the &quot;Gie&#x00df;ener Schwarzen&quot; with Karl Follen and Georg B&#x00fc;chner marked the revolutionary spirit of this decade.
established$$$@@@%%%With the appointment of the 21 year old <a>Justus von Liebig</a> in 1824 through the Grand Duchy&#x2014;against the will of the university on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt&#x2014;a new era in the natural sciences began, not only in Gie&#x00df;en.
established$$$@@@%%%Young, promising scientists created a new impulse in their respective areas of knowledge; among these scientists were the antiquarian Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, the lawyer Rudolf von Jhreing, the theologian Adolf von Harnack, and the physicist Wilhelm Conrad R&#x00f6;ntgen.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the turn of the 20th century, the Ludoviciana began to expand into a modern university.
established$$$@@@%%%During this period, new clinics in human and veterinary medicine were established, and the university library received its first proper building.
established$$$@@@%%%With the creation of the university's central building (inaugurated 1880) and the adjacent newly constructed facilities for chemistry and physics a new cultural center was established on what was then the border of the city.
established$$$@@@%%%The decisive backer of this project was the last Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, to whom the university bestowed out of thankfulness the honorary title of &quot;Rector Magnificentissimus.&quot;
students$$$@@@%%%In 1902 the student body surpassed one thousand.
established$$$@@@%%%For the first time included in the student body were women, who since 1900 were admitted as guest students and starting in 1908 were admitted for regular study.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>After the different Hessian states were (re-)united in 1929, both universities became public universities of that German state.
established$$$@@@%%%The University of Gie&#x00df;en now has almost 23,000 students and 8,500 employees, which together with the <a>University of Applied Sciences Giessen-Friedberg</a>, makes Gie&#x00df;en the most student-dominated German city.</p>
