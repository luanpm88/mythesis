<p><strong>Medgar Evers College</strong> is a college campus (offering <a>baccalaureate</a> and <a>associate</a> degrees) of <a>The City University of New York</a>.</p>
<p>Medgar Evers College was officially established in 1970 through cooperation from educators and community leaders in central <a>Brooklyn</a>.
The College is named after <a>Medgar Wiley Evers</a>, a <a>Mississippi</a>-born <a>black</a> <a>civil rights</a> activist who, while serving in <a>World War II</a>, became disenchanted by the knowledge that he was fighting for freedom halfway around the world while he and other <a>American</a> blacks endured <a>segregation</a> and other forms of <a>racism</a>.
He later helped secure many social and political advances for <a>African American</a>s, including helping the first black student, <a>James Meredith</a>, attend the previously-whites-only <a>University of Mississippi</a> in 1962.
Evers was assassinated on June 12, 1963.</p>
<p>The College is divided into four schools:  The School of Business; The School of Professional and Community Development; The School of Liberal Arts and Education; and The School of Science, Health, and Technology.
<p>Medgar Evers College has the distinction of being the youngest of the four-year senior colleges in <a>The City University of New York</a>.
Members of the various community-based organizations constituted the Bedford-Stuyvesant Coalition on Educational Needs and Services, which served as the primary vehicle for interfacing with the Board of Higher Education.
After many discussions and much involvement by community residents and the Coalition, the Board of Higher Education, on November 17, 1967, &quot;approved the sponsorship of Community College Number VII, with the indication of an intention to admit students in the Fall of 1969.&quot;</p>
<p>On February 13, 1968, the Board of Higher Education announced that the college would be located in the <a>Bedford-Stuyvesant</a> area of <a>Brooklyn</a>.
On January 27, 1969 the Board approved the establishment of an &quot;experimental four-year college of professional studies offering both career and transfer associate degrees and the baccalaureate degree, to be located in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, said college to be established in place of a previously approved but not started new Community College VII, and further directed that the City University Master Plan be amended accordingly.&quot;
This action was endorsed by action of the Regents on March 20, 1970.</p>
<p>The Board of Higher Education Proceedings of April 14, 1970 reflect the Board action, which modified the 1968 Master Plan to delete Community College Number Seven and listed in lieu thereof under Senior College, &quot;College XVII, Mid-Brooklyn, Initial Facilities, Estimated Cost: $10,000,000.&quot;
The College was officially established on July 30, 1970 when Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a> signed the legislation approving the &quot;establishment of an experimental four-year college of professional studies offering both career and transfer associate degrees and the baccalaureate degree...&quot; Finally, on September 28, 1970 the Board of Higher Education approved the recommendation from the College&#x2019;s Community Council that the name of the college be Medgar Evers College, in honor of the martyred civil rights leader, <a>Medgar Wiley Evers</a> (1925&#x2013;1963).
In recognition of this, September 28 is observed as &quot;Founders&#x2019; Day&quot; at Medgar Evers College.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1970, the Medgar Evers College Community Council, chaired by John Enoch, and the Board of Higher Education co-hosted an announcement ceremony at the <a>Y.M.C.A.</a> on 139 Monroe Street in Brooklyn.
Chairman Enoch stated, &quot;The Medgar Evers College, reflecting the image of the martyred leader who dedicated his life to the cause of individual freedom, dignity and personal fulfillment, will add another pillar of strength to the growing educational, economic, cultural and social foundations of the central Brooklyn community and New York City.&quot;
Mr. Evers&#x2019; widow, Mrs. <a>Myrlie Evers</a>, and two of the couple&#x2019;s three children flew in from <a>Claremont, California</a> for the ceremony.
She was presented a scroll that cited Mr. Evers&#x2019; &quot;...effective contribution to the cause of human freedom and dignity...In choosing the name of <a>Medgar Evers</a>, it is our hope that his ideals will inspire students and faculty of the college in their pursuit of truth as the surest path to human freedom and social justice.&quot;</p>
