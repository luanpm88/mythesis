established$$$@@@%%%<p>  The <strong>Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies</strong> (BYU Jerusalem Center), situated on <a>Mount Scopus</a> in <a>Jerusalem</a>, <a>Israel</a>, is a satellite campus of <a>Brigham Young University</a> (BYU), the largest religious university in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%Owned by <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church), the center provides a curriculum that focuses on <a>Old</a> and <a>New Testament</a>, ancient and modern <a>Near Eastern studies</a>, and language (<a>Hebrew</a> and <a>Arabic</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, <a>BYU-Idaho</a>, or <a>BYU-Hawaii</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Plans to build a center for students were announced by <a>LDS Church President</a> <a>Spencer W. Kimball</a> in 1979.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1984, the church had obtained a 49-year lease on the land and had begun construction.
established$$$@@@%%%The center's prominent position on the Jerusalem skyline quickly brought it notice by the religious conservatives, or <a>Haredim</a>, of Israel.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Protests and opposition to the building of the center springing from the Haredim made the issue of building the center a national and even international issue.
established$$$@@@%%%After several investigative committees of Israel's <a>Knesset</a> reviewed and debated the issue, Israeli officials decided to allow the center's construction to continue in 1986.
established$$$@@@%%%The center opened to students in May 1988 and was dedicated by <a>Howard W. Hunter</a> on May 16, 1989.
established$$$@@@%%%It did not admit students from 2001 to 2006 due to security issues during the <a>Second Intifada</a> but continued to provide tours for visitors and weekly concerts.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h3>Before the center</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first LDS official to enter Jerusalem was <a>LDS Apostle</a> <a>Orson Hyde</a>, who came in 1841 and dedicated the land for the gathering of the people of Israel, the creation of a Jewish state, and the building of an LDS temple at some future time.
established$$$@@@%%%After his visit, LDS presence in the city was virtually non-existent.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1971, the city saw enough Mormon visitors for the church to lease a building in East Jerusalem for church services.&lt;!-- , first at the City Hotel in Jerusalem.<img>
established$$$@@@%%%and then at the Vienna Hotel in <a>Sheikh Jarrah</a>.<img>
established$$$@@@%%%In 1978, the program relocated to dormitory facilities in <a>Kibbutz</a> <a>Ramat Rachel</a>.<img>--&gt;
established$$$@@@%%%Brigham Young University's study abroad program to Jerusalem, which began in 1968, played a key role in the growth of LDS visitors to the area.
established$$$@@@%%%The Mormon presence in the area soon grew too large for the leased space to provide adequate space for worship, so the church began looking into building a center for students.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1972 <a>David B. Galbraith</a> became the director of the BYU's program in Jerusalem.
established$$$@@@%%%He remained in this position until 1987 when was asked by the <a>First Presidency</a> to take on the responsibility of organizing the BYU Jerusalem Center.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On October 24, 1979, church President Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem to dedicate the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, located on the <a>Mount of Olives</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion.
established$$$@@@%%%It was at this dedication that President Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city.
established$$$@@@%%%Negotiations between the church and the Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984.
established$$$@@@%%%The land the church wanted for the center, located on the southwestern side of Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the <a>Six Day War</a> of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law.
established$$$@@@%%%The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead.
established$$$@@@%%%Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land.
established$$$@@@%%%Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law.
established$$$@@@%%%By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Construction and controversy</h3>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|300px|The distinctive multiple-arched BYU Jerusalem Center (top left) amid the buildings of Jerusalem</a></p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The 1980s saw many other Christian groups vying for representation and space in the city.
established$$$@@@%%%These groups constantly faced opposition from a strong political minority of Orthodox Jews living in the city.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Neither major political party in Israel (the <a>Likud</a> and <a>Labor Parties</a>) could achieve a majority vote in the <a>Knesset</a> without support from the more religious parties.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Religious parties used this situation to pass laws in favor of Jewish Orthodoxy in exchange for their support on other issues.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time, the conservative Jews, who made up the &quot;religious right&quot; in Israel, or the <a>Haredim</a>, constituted 27% of the population of Jerusalem, and was decidedly against the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center or any other similar Christian structure.
type$$$@@@%%%Larger parties faced loss of a majority if they stood opposite on this issue.
established$$$@@@%%%Many Israeli officials, however, such as the <a>Mayor of Jerusalem</a> at the time, <a>Teddy Kollek</a>, along with others in attendance at the <a>Orson Hyde Garden</a> dedication, supported the center because of what the church had done for the city.
established$$$@@@%%%Kollek specifically stated that &quot;the Mormon church's presence in Jerusalem can do a great deal of work in providing the bridge of understanding between the Arab and Jews...because its members look with sympathy and understanding at both sides.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The land on which the center was built was then still considered Arab land by many, and many officials saw that its lease would add an image of religious tolerance to their government and increase Israeli control of the land.
established$$$@@@%%%The LDS Church, they argued, had no local presence in the population of the Jerusalem area and no historical connections to the land.
type$$$@@@%%%Some even gathered at the <a>Wailing Wall</a> in a public prayer of mourning because of the center.
image_size$$$@@@%%%They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point, carrying signs saying: &quot;Conversion is Murder!&quot; and &quot;Mormons, stop your mission now&quot;.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Death threats were sent to the Director of the center and to Mayor Kolleck, and some threatened to bomb the center.
established$$$@@@%%%(A <a>Baptist church</a>, the first in Jerusalem, had actually been bombed only a few years earlier in 1982.
established$$$@@@%%%(the committee found the church &quot;Not Guilty&quot;).
established$$$@@@%%%A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Some Israelis considered this discriminatory, as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem.
established$$$@@@%%%Church leaders, however, agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after.
established$$$@@@%%%Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church's intent,  believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%One protestor stated that &quot;converting the sons of <a>Judah</a>, us, is a basic article of their faith. . . .
type$$$@@@%%%They regard themselves as sons of <a>Joseph</a> and believe there will be no <a>Second Coming</a> for as long as we and they do not fuse.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to the promise not to proselyte, BYU began a public relations campaign to inform the public of their intentions for the center as a school and a gathering place for those already of the LDS faith.
established$$$@@@%%%Ads were purchased in local newspapers, magazines, and on television, and the center had personnel appear on radio talk shows.
established$$$@@@%%%Government officials in favor of the center also began to speak out, saying that Jerusalem should deny no one a place to worship, Jew, Muslim, or Christian.
established$$$@@@%%%The Minister for Economic Planning, <a>Gad Yaakobi</a> said that the debate had &quot;already caused considerable damage to Israel&quot;, and Former Foreign Minister <a>Abba Eban</a> stated that the &quot;free exercise of conscience and dissent in a democratic society&quot; was at stake.
established$$$@@@%%%The center also received support in the U.S., as former President <a>Gerald Ford</a> spoke for the center, as well the <a>United Jewish Council of Utah</a>, who wrote a letter stating that &quot;For over one hundred years, the Jewish and LDS communities have coexisted in the Salt Lake Valley in a spirit of true friendship and harmony.
established$$$@@@%%%It has been our experience that when the leaders of the LDS Church make a commitment of policy, it is a commitment which can be relied upon.
established$$$@@@%%%The stated commitment of Brigham Young University not to violate the laws of the state of Israel, or its own commitment regarding proselytizing in the state of Israel through the Jerusalem-based Brigham Young facility, is a commitment which we sincerely believe will be honored.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The U.S. government also became an intermediary for BYU as 154 members of <a>Congress</a> issued a letter to the Knesset in support of the BYU Jerusalem Center.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1986, the Knesset approved the completion of the center.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>On June 9, 2006, officials announced their intention to reopen the Jerusalem Center for the Fall 2006 semester.
established$$$@@@%%%However, escalating violence in the area from the <a>2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict</a> frustrated these plans and raised new concerns about students' safety in the area.
established$$$@@@%%%School officials deemed the center would remain closed until the conflict was resolved.
established$$$@@@%%%During this time, some LDS members in Northern Israel were &quot;voluntarily relocated&quot; into the center, away from border missile strikes.
established$$$@@@%%%BYU officials announced on October 9, 2006 that the center would be reopening for student academic programs for Winter Semester 2007.
established$$$@@@%%%The initial program was limited to only 44 students.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The center remains open into future academic terms.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h2>Facilities and architecture</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Building seen from below</a> The center is situated on Mount Scopus overlooking the Mount of Olives, the <a>Kidron Valley</a>, and the <a>Old City</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The , eight-level structure is set amid  of gardens.
established$$$@@@%%%The first five levels provide dormitory and apartment space for up to 170 students, each of these apartments having a patio overlooking the Old City.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The sixth level houses a cafeteria, classrooms, computer facilities, and a gymnasium, while administrative and faculty offices are located on the seventh level, along with a 250-seat auditorium.
established$$$@@@%%%The main entry is on the eighth level, which also contains a recital and special events auditorium with organ, lecture rooms, general and reserve libraries, offices, a domed theater, and a learning resource area.
campus$$$@@@%%%This auditorium is surrounded by glass on three sides, providing views of the city.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The organ within it is a Scandinavian-made <a>Marcussen organ</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The aforementioned library on the same floor as the auditorium contains 10,000-15,000 volumes focusing largely on the Near East.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>The center's design reflects the architecture of the Near East.
established$$$@@@%%%It is constructed of hand-carved <a>Jerusalem limestone</a>, according to local custom.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The center provides a curriculum that focuses on <a>Old</a> and <a>New Testament</a>, ancient and modern <a>Near Eastern studies</a>, and language (<a>Hebrew</a> and <a>Arabic</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open only to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, <a>BYU-Idaho</a>, or <a>BYU-Hawaii</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Church leaders constantly see the mission of the Jerusalem Center in the context of these beliefs.
established$$$@@@%%%Howard W. Hunter, who was President of the church's Quorum of the Twelve at the time of the center's construction, pointed out that although there would be no proselyting from the center, it still served a valuable purpose.
nickname$$$@@@%%%One church member quoted him this way: &quot;Elder Hunter said that our mission was not to harvest, probably not even to plant, but to clear away a few more stones.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Latter-day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example, rather than by proselyting.
free_label$$$@@@%%%This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives, as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers, as an example of what can be done through cooperation.
established$$$@@@%%%During construction of the center, for example, the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time, with about 60% of them being Arab and the other 40% being Jewish.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Similar cooperation continues today.</p>
