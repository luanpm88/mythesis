free_label$$$@@@%%%<h3>Football</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The 2005 move of the Buccaneers from the <a>Southern Conference</a> to the Atlantic Sun was an indirect result of ETSU President Stanton's decision, following the 1999 ETSU Athletic Task Force recommendations, to drop the ETSU football program after the 2003 season, in response to budget limitations imposed by the state legislature.
established$$$@@@%%%The football program was posting close to $1 million in financial losses each year between 1999-2003.</p>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<h4>Proposed student athletic fee increase</h4>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>ETSU President Stanton announced on December 22, 2006 that the ETSU administration is now supporting the return of <a>the ETSU NCAA Division I FCS football program</a> to the university, after accepting the recent ETSU Football Task Force report calling for increased student athletic fees to both restore the ETSU football program and additional funding for equivalent female athletic programs to meet U.S. federal Title IX gender equity requirements.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Dr. Stanton has stated that ETSU will &quot;need $4 million to $5 million&quot; collected each year from of a combination students fees and private contributors to &quot;get it all done.&quot;</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Both the ETSU student body (by a referendum vote) and the <a>Tennessee Board of Regents</a> would have needed to approve Stanton's proposal to increase ETSU student athletic fees for funding a new football program before competing in the 2010 season.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>Stanton also stated that ETSU generates approximately $500,000 of revenue from every $25 student athletic fees collected each semester at ETSU (i.e., a conservative estimate of student fees fully funding ETSU football at the $5 million dollar level would amount to an additional $250 in ETSU student athletic fees each year).</p>
