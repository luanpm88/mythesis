<h2>History</h2>
<p>ETSU was founded as East Tennessee State <a>Normal School</a>, to educate teachers; the K-12 training school, called University School, operates to this day.
East Tennessee State officially became a college in 1925 when it changed its name to East Tennessee State Teachers College, subsequently gaining accreditation from the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a> in 1927.
In 1943, East Tennessee State Teacher's College was expanded into a college with a range of <a>liberal arts</a> offerings, becoming East Tennessee State College.
The college became a <a>University</a> in 1963, adopting the name it holds today.</p>
<p>ETSU announced plans to open a College of Pharmacy in 2005, rapidly receiving local support to secure the approval.
Full accreditation was granted in June 2010, shortly after the first class of the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy graduated.</p>
Both are part of ETSU&#x2019;s Health Sciences Division, which also includes the James H. Quillen College of Medicine, the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy, and the College of Nursing.</p>
It will feature concentrations in sport physiology and sport performance, and is expected to start in 2010.</p>
<p>Recording star <a>Kenny Chesney</a>, four-time <a>Country Music Association</a> <a>Entertainer of the Year</a>, holds a degree in advertising.
Another notable ETSU attendee is <a>Timothy Busfield</a>, known for his Emmy Award-winning role on the popular 1980s <a>TV series</a> <em><a>thirtysomething</a></em>.
He starred in a series of advertisements for the school in the late 1980s.
<a>Ron Ramsey</a>, the current Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, graduated from ETSU in 1978 majoring in Industrial Technology.
<a>Ronald E. Carrier</a>, a 1955 graduate of ETSU, was the fourth President of <a>James Madison University</a>, serving from 1971 to 1998.
In FY09, ETSU was awarded over $40 million in research, public service, and training/instruction grants.
In the 2006-07 year, ETSU won both the conference's men and women's <a>All-Sport trophies</a>, winning seven team titles.
A new on-campus soccer field, Summers-Taylor Stadium, opened in fall 2007.
<p><a>thumb|left|ETSU Memorial Center, also known as the Mini Dome</a> The Mini-Dome on the campus of ETSU houses the intercollegiate athletics offices, and is the venue for men's and women's basketball.
Still known by students, faculty, and the community as the Mini-Dome, this campus landmark has been officially renamed from <strong>Memorial Center</strong> to the <strong>ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center</strong>.
The largest building on the ETSU campus, it hosts several indor <a>track and field</a> meets, and was once the home field for the university's football program.
<p>The men's head coach has been <a>Murry Bartow</a> since 2003, and he has led the Bucs to win the 2004 <a>Southern Conference</a> championship, 2007 <a>Atlantic Sun</a> title, the <a>2009 Atlantic Sun Tournament championship</a>, and the <a>2010 Atlantic Sun Tournament championship</a>.
Kemp is only the second head coach at ETSU to reach the 100-win milestone and currently holds the record for most wins in the school's history at 214 and rising.</p>
<p>The 2005 move of the Buccaneers from the <a>Southern Conference</a> to the Atlantic Sun was an indirect result of ETSU President Stanton's decision, following the 1999 ETSU Athletic Task Force recommendations, to drop the ETSU football program after the 2003 season, in response to budget limitations imposed by the state legislature.
The football program was posting close to $1 million in financial losses each year between 1999-2003.</p>
