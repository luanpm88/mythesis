type$$$@@@%%%It is located in <a>Pathum Thani</a>, <a>Thailand</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Known as one of the premier research universities in Thailand, it offers <a>science</a>, <a>technology</a> and <a>engineering</a> education, as well as related <a>management</a> programs.
nickname$$$@@@%%%All are international programs, with English language as a medium of instruction.
type$$$@@@%%%The institute is part of the <a>LAOTSE</a> network, an international cooperation of leading universities in <a>Europe</a> and <a>Asia</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although it is an academic unit of Thammasat University and its graduates receive Thammasat University degrees, the institute is self-administered and -financed (similar to a '<a>Deemed University</a>' in <a>India</a>.)</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since it is a research-led academic institution in nature, the Academic year 2003 performance evaluation showed has the highest number of research publications (both in raw quantity and per graduate student heads) of any academic division in the university.
country$$$@@@%%%In addition, a 2007 assessment of research publications by Thailand Research Fund put SIIT at the top of all engineering faculties in the kingdom in terms of equivalent international journal papers per faculty member and in terms of impact factor per faculty member..</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the ninth Japan-Thailand Joint Trade and Economic Committee Meeting held in Kobe, Japan in <a>1989</a>, all the delegates from the <a>Japan Federation of Economic Organizations</a> (Keidanren) and the <a>Federation of Thai Industries</a> (FTI) realized that to enhance industrial development of Thailand, engineers with working knowledge of <a>English</a> are needed.
established$$$@@@%%%Therefore, it was recommended that engineering programs, where all lecture and laboratory courses would be taught in English by highly qualified faculty members with doctoral degrees, be established.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A cooperation agreement among Keidanren, FTI, and Thammasat University was reached in <a>1992</a> to establish bachelor degree programs in engineering at Thammasat University with initial funds provided by Keidanren and FTI.
established$$$@@@%%%After two years of operation, the <strong><a>International Institute of Technology</a> (IIT)</strong> was founded on September 16, 1994.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn</a> graciously presided over the cornerstone laying ceremony of a new building at the Rangsit Center of Thammasat University using part of the initial fund.
established$$$@@@%%%Then, on June 28, 1996, <a>His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej</a> of Thailand graciously granted the Institute a new name: <strong>Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>SIIT</strong>).
established$$$@@@%%%On October 2, 1997, Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn graciously presided over the inauguration ceremony of its name and building.
established$$$@@@%%%In June <a>2001</a>, the former Prime Minister <a>Anand Panyarachun</a> inaugurated a new campus at Bangkadi Industrial Park.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Administration independency</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although it is a unit of Thammasat University, SIIT is financially and administratively separate from the central university system.
established$$$@@@%%%SIIT's policies and operations are guided and supervised by the Board of Trustees which consists of representatives from Thammasat University, FTI, <a>Nippon Keidanren</a>, and scholars appointed by the university.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In addition, the Academic Review Committee (ARC) comprising reputable scholars provides guidance and recommendations on academic and research matters.
established$$$@@@%%%The institute, headed by the director, consists of four administrative divisions, a library and information services center, and six academic schools, with 15 academic programs.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As the institute is an autonomous (semi-private) body of Thammasat University, it gets no funding from the state and needs to find and manage its own income and spending.
established$$$@@@%%%To starts its operation, the institute received initial funds from Keidanren and FTI.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Parts of funding are research grants and scholarships from international organizations like <a>Asian Development Bank</a>, local ones like industries and the <a>Thailand Research Fund</a>, and individual contributions.
established$$$@@@%%%The rest of funding is from tuition fees, which is arguably high comparing to state-funded academic institutes.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academics</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>One of SIIT's academic strengths, that the institute often points out in a student recruitment ads, is its high qualification of faculty members.
faculty$$$@@@%%%All faculty members are doctoral degree holders, with strong research and/or industrial experiences.
established$$$@@@%%%From the eyes of general Thai students, they give the value to the institute's up-to-date courses, English as a language of instruction (which means language competency and generally higher salary in the country), and being part of the prestigious Thammasat University.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%The institute is considered among academic peers as a research intensive engineering school.
country$$$@@@%%%Research output-wise, on average, each year each SIIT faculty member produces twice the highest value of national range for international journal publications (0.74 vs 0-0.41).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2007, the <a>Thailand Research Fund</a> assessed research outcomes of universities in Thailand, and SIIT ranked as &quot;Very Good&quot; for all three indicators, making it the only engineering school in the country to achieved this.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since a few prospect students can afford the higher-than-national-average tuition fees, the institute initially faces a slight difficulty to recruit undergraduate students with very high National University Entrance Examination scores.
established$$$@@@%%%While scholarships and special recruitment programs do help attract  many bright students, its average entrance score is still not very high comparing to other leading science and engineering programs in the country &mdash; which, in turns, affects the image of the institute in the eyes of Thais.
country$$$@@@%%%Due to the latest Entrance Examination scores, the school is comparatively easy for most students to get admitted.
established$$$@@@%%%The average entrance score of admitted students is still low and makes the program not competitive.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>However, the undergraduate recruitment situation is improving by years, especially for its computer, IT and management-related majors, which now have very high average entrance scores.
established$$$@@@%%%With its strong science and technology education, the institute has been selected, along with <a>Mahidol University</a> and <a>Chulalongkorn University</a>, by <a>Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency</a> (NSTDA), as a destination of selected group of top students from <a>Mahidol Wittayanusorn School</a> and 12 <a>Princess Chulaporn Schools for Science</a>, the country's science schools for gifted students, in a program to mentor junior researchers for national science and technology development.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>For its graduate levels, the institute attracts a lot of bright graduates, as the institute gains supports from many national and international bodies (and use that as scholarships for graduate students).
country$$$@@@%%%SIIT is one of a very small number of universities that can secure numbers of Thailand Research Fund's Royal Golden Jubilee grants, considered to be the country's most prestigious research grants for PhD students, for every single year since the program began in 1998 &mdash; one of the only three that can secure Engineering discipline grants that often.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Cooperations</h2>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>The institute enjoys a strong link with many universities, remarkably with its neighbor <a>Asian Institute of Technology</a> (AIT) and a group of Japanese universities and research centers, as well as a network of European universities such as <a>DAAD</a> <a>International Quality Network</a> (IQN) program and <a>LAOTSE</a> network.
established$$$@@@%%%Locally, a remarkable collaborative network is the <a>Joint Graduate School of Energy and Environment</a>, a group of leading Thai universities in environmental and energy technology area.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The institute established faculty member and student exchange programs, as well as internship programs, with universities and organizations in <a>Asia</a>, <a>Australia</a>, <a>Europe</a>, and <a>North America</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%These programs allow faculty members to collaborate with their counterparts in research projects, and students to have an opportunity to take engineering courses at these universities.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Additionally, qualified foreign professors are regularly invited to visit and conduct courses at SIIT.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>Because of their proximity, SIIT, Thammasat University, AIT, Thailand Science Park, and research centers of NSTDA, share some of their facilities, including libraries and laboratories, with each other.
established$$$@@@%%%In <a>1998</a>, the <a>Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology</a> (TGIST) was established by NSTDA to further strengthen its collaboration with academics and industries; SIIT is among three major academic institutes in TGIST's &quot;Thailand Science Park Collaboration&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In <a>2007</a>, SIIT joined NSTDA, <a>King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang</a>, and <a>Tokyo Institute of Technology</a> as founding members in the establishment of <a>Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%This joint graduate school will offer international postgraduate degrees, where faculty staffs will come from Tokyo Tech, NSTDA, and Thai universities.</p>
