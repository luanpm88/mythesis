SGUL also refers to Scottish Golf Union Limited, the board of the <a>Scottish Golf Union</a>.</em>
<p><strong>St George's, University of London</strong> (<strong>SGUL</strong>), previously known as <strong>St George's Hospital Medical School</strong> (<strong>SGHMS</strong>), is a specialist <a>medical college</a> of the <a>University of London</a>, and one of the <a>United Hospitals</a>.
The college has its origins in 1733, and was the second institution in <a>England</a> to provide formal training courses for doctors (after the <a>University of Oxford</a>).
St George's Hospital Medical School affiliated with the University of London soon after the latter's establishment in 1836.
<p>Originally set up in 1733 next to <a>Hyde Park Corner</a> (now the site of <a>The Lanesborough</a> hotel), in central <a>London</a>, the college was transferred to its current site, <a>Tooting</a> in <a>South London</a> in 1980, where it shares a site with <a>St George's Healthcare NHS Trust</a>.
The inspections report was published in January 2000 and the course, curriculum and teaching methods at St George's have changed since then.
Alongside its medical course now runs a Biomedical Sciences course, which has expanded to meet demand in the last 5 years from an initial intake of 30, to 150 students.
<p>In partnership with <a>Kingston University</a>, The Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences has moved St George's into other areas.
The Faculty has been congratulated for its high teaching standards, employment rates and cutting edge research in the social sciences.</p>
<p>St George's was also the first institution in the United Kingdom to offer a four year graduate entry medicine degree based on the program from <a>Flinders University</a> with which it has an exchange program.
The first intake was in 2000 with 35 students and the course has since been emulated by many other universities.
Entry to the course is highly competitive with candidates being required to sit the <a>GAMSAT</a> as part of the application process.</p>
<p>In 2008, St George's announced that it planned to merge with <a>Royal Holloway</a> to form a single institution within the University of London.
The merger was called off in a joint statement by the two colleges' principals on 25 September 2009.
St George's intends to keep working with Royal Holloway in the field of health and social care along with its well-established Joint Faculty with Kingston University.
St George's, Kingston University and Royal Holloway will continue to collaborate in the field of health and social care as part of the existing SWan (South West London Academic Network) healthcare alliance.</p>
<p>As of 1 April 2008 Professor <a>Peter Kopelman</a> took up the position of Principal of SGUL.
<p>The Students' Union (until recently, the School Club) organises various activities including fancy dress discos and a <a>Rag Week</a>, the annual series of fund-raising events, which in the year 2007-2008 raised around &#x00a3;80,000 for various charities including Cancer Research, Barnardos and Leonard Cheshire.
In recent years the Union has become more politically aware and shown greater interest in <a>National Union of Students</a> and <a>British Medical Association</a> activities.</p>
These 'parents' act as mentors for the new students, giving them advice about the course, often tutoring them when needed, as well as buying them drinks during Freshers' Week and beyond.
<p>The university owns one hall of residence, Horton Halls, a large, modern site first opened to new students in late September 2007.

<p>King&#x2019;s is a hovel on the strand</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d rather go to George&#x2019;s,</p>
<p>&#x2018;Cos George&#x2019;s is the finest in the land, &#x2018;Cor Blimey!</p>
