<p>  The <strong>University of Hertfordshire</strong> is a university based largely in <a>Hatfield</a>, in the county of <a>Hertfordshire</a>, England, from which the university takes its name.
In the 2008 <a>RAE</a> the university was ranked 58th out of 138 UK institutions, and over 85 per cent of the submitted research was judged to be of international quality in terms of originality, significance and rigour </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1951, the <a>de Havilland</a> company gave land in Hatfield adjoining the <a>A1</a> to <a>Hertfordshire County Council</a> for educational use in perpetuity; the Council used this to build and operate <strong>Hatfield Technical College</strong>, which trained aerospace engineers for Hatfield's then-dominant <a>aerospace</a> <a>industry</a>.
In 1967 it became an early <a>polytechnic</a>, <strong>The Hatfield Polytechnic</strong>.
With the passage of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act, 1992</a>, the institution gained university status.&lt;!--</p>
<li>De Havilland Campus, also a <a>Saracens</a> training ground and business campus</li>
<p>The main site of the university remains the College Lane campus, which houses the original Hatfield Technical College building, though the site has had many new buildings added since.
<p>de Havilland campus is situated within 15&nbsp;minutes walk of College Lane, and is built on a former <a>BAe</a> site.
The Law School is based in <a>St Albans</a>, near to the law courts.
There were formerly campuses in <a>Watford</a> (Wall Hall) and <a>Hertford</a> (Balls Park), but these were closed when the de Havilland campus opened.
A fourth site in <a>Bayfordbury</a> houses the university's observatory and the <a>biology</a> plus geography field stations.
The University has particular research strengths in History, Computer Science, Astrophysics and especially Engineering given the university's history in training Aerospace Engineers as a polytechnic.</p>
These formerly took place in the Union's Hutton Hall or the peculiarly shaped building commonly known as the &quot;Elehouse&quot;, named due to its original architecture being similar to the elephant house at <a>London Zoo</a>.
<p>The University of Hertfordshire is also home to <a>HIBT</a>, part of the <a>Navitas</a> group, providing a direct pathway for international students to the university, on campus.
to the University.</p>
<p>Hertfordshire was described as &quot;the flagship of the former polys&quot; by the <em>Independent</em> in 2002.
As a polytechnic, it was strong in <a>aerospace engineering</a> and <a>computer science</a>.
More recently, it has built up its strengths in other areas such as <a>pharmacology</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>geography</a> and <a>astrophysics</a>.
<li>Computer Science is accredited by the <a>British Computer Society</a> (BCS)</li>
<p>(Schools of Study)</p>
<p>The university has invested <a>&#x00a3;</a> 200 million over the last ten years in developing facilities on the two main campuses, including the new de Havilland campus in Hatfield (opened 2003/2004), the Learning Resources Centre on the College Lane campus, the Hertfordshire Sports Village, new teaching laboratories in most Schools, including a state-of-the-art medical simulation centre called <a>HICESC</a> (Hertfordshire Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Simulation Centre), and most recently the Forum, opening in academic year 2009/10.</p>
<p>Hertfordshire was one of the first universities in the country to develop a Paramedic Science degree.
The University's 4 year Paramedic Science course also features a period of elective study which can be undertaken anywhere in the world, and a sandwich year working for the Ambulance Service.
The university is also among the first four universities in the country to offer the <a>Postgraduate Diploma</a> in <a>Physician Assistant</a> studies, and the first in the UK to offer the option of an <a>MSc</a> in the field.</p>
The UH Racing cars can accelerate from 0-60&nbsp;mph in less than 3&nbsp;seconds and pull over 2g in the corners.
Students from the Engineering degrees can join the team, with students from the Sports Science, Marketing, Art and Business Schools playing a vital role.
<p>On 1 July 2004, the University of Hertfordshire was presented with the <a>Queen's Award for Enterprise</a>: International Trade in recognition of outstanding achievement.
The University received a special message of congratulations from the Queen, and the Vice-Chancellor and International Office staff also attended a special reception at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>In 2004 the University of Hertfordshire was awarded &#x00a3;4.5M
This award enables the university to establish its profile as a leading institution combining established ways of learning and teaching with the opportunities offered by technology to ensure students have the best possible learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Trade University</strong></p>
<p>In March 2005, University of Hertfordshire was officially certified as a <a>Fair trade university</a>.</p>
<p>Seven members of staff have achieved lifelong Fellowship awards as outstanding teachers, as part of the National Teaching Fellowship Scheme introduced in 2000 by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Of the 2010 league tables published so far the University of Hertfordshire was ranked 41st overall in <em>The Complete University Guide</em>, published by <em>The Independent</em>, which is a 4 place rise from the previous year.
15th in the Engineering schools, which is a 9 place rise from the previous year  and 60th by <em>The Guardian</em>, which is a 37 place rise from the previous year.</p>

<h2>University symbols</h2>
<p>The University of Hertfordshire prescribes <a>academic dress</a> for its members.
<p>The academic dress of bachelors of the university is a black <a>stuff</a> gown, with facings and long open sleeves gathered to a point at the elbow with a button.
Because of the university's emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, there is no distinction between the academic dress of the various faculties.</p>
<h3>Coat of arms</h3>
<p>The University's <a>coat of arms</a> was granted in 1992.
The crest, a <a>Phoenix</a>, represents the University's origin in the aviation industry.

Its design symbolises the University's origins, expertise and associations.
Its shape is inspired by the shape of an aeroplane wing symbolising the university's origin in the aviation industry.
The head of the mace is engraved with zodiac symbols representing the university's contribution to astronomy and also contains the DNA double helix representing the biological sciences and microprocessor chips representing information and communications technology.</p>
