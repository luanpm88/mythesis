<p><strong>London Guildhall University</strong> was a university in the <a>United Kingdom</a> from 1992 to 2002.
On 1 August 2002, it merged with the <a>University of North London</a> to form <strong><a>London Metropolitan University</a></strong>.
The former London Guildhall University premises now form the new University's City campus, situated on various sites in the <a>City of London</a>.</p>
<p>In 1848 Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London, called upon the clergy to establish evening classes to improve the moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in London.
Subjects on the original curriculum included Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, History, Mathematics, Drawing and Natural Philosophy.
In 1860 the classes moved to Sussex Hall, the former Livery Hall of the Bricklayers' Company, in Leadenhall Street.
<p>In 1861 the classes were reconstituted as the <strong>City of London College</strong>.
Over the next twenty years, the College was one of the pioneers in the introduction of commercial and technical subjects.
The College built new premises in White Street at a cost of &#x00a3;16,000 (contributions were received from Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales) and were opened in 1881.
In 1891 the College joined the Birkbeck Institute (now <a>Birkbeck College</a>, <a>University of London</a>) and the Northampton Institute (now <a>City University, London</a>) to form the notional City Polytechnic by a Charity Commissioners' scheme to facilitate funding for these institutions by the City Parochial Foundation, and to enable the three institutions to work cooperatively.
The City Polytechnic concept was dissolved in 1906, and the City of London College came under the supervision of <a>London County Council</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1940 the College's building was destroyed by a German air raid.
The College subsequently moved into premises at 84 Moorgate (now London Metropolitan Business School) in 1944.
The College celebrated its centenary in 1948 with a service of thanksgiving addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul's Cathedral.
In 1970 the College merged with the <strong>Sir John Cass College of Arts and Science</strong> to form the <strong>City of London Polytechnic</strong>.
The <a>London College of Furniture</a> was incorporated into the Polytechnic in 1990.
London Guildhall University was named in order to show its links with the City of London and the City's many guilds/livery companies.
It was unassociated with the <a>Guildhall School of Music and Drama</a>, based at the <a>Barbican Centre</a>.</p>
It includes the Sir John Cass Department of Art, Media and Design and Sir John Cass Hall of Residence, so named because of the continued support of the <a>Sir John Cass</a> Foundation.
