<p><strong>Christian Brothers University</strong> is the oldest collegiate degree-granting institution in the city of <a>Memphis</a>.
The university is run by the <a>Christian Brothers</a>, a Roman <a>Catholic religious order</a> founded by <a>St.
John Baptist de la Salle</a>, the <a>patron saint</a> of teachers.
It is located in <a>Midtown Memphis</a> near <a>Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|120px|left|Saint John Baptist de la Salle</a> <strong>Christian Brothers College</strong> was founded November 19, 1871, by members of the De La Salle Christian Brothers.
The Brothers came to Memphis at the request of the people and <a>clergy</a> of the city, after more than a decade of efforts to persuade the Brothers to open a college in Memphis.</p>
<p><a>Christian Brothers University</a> traces its origins to priest and educational innovator, St. John Baptist de la Salle.
De la Salle began a system of <a>Christian</a> schools in which teachers assist parents in the educational, ethical, and religious formation of their children.
To continue his <a>spiritual</a> and <a>pedagogical</a> vision, de la Salle founded the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, known today as the De La Salle Christian Brothers.</p>
<p>Today, the spirit and tradition of the Lasallian community thrives in 81 countries and in more than 1,000 educational institutions.
<p>Christian Brothers College officially became Christian Brothers University in June 1990.
LeMoyne College (one of the two constituent parts of present-day <a>LeMoyne-Owen College</a>) also claims a founding year of 1871, but it was an elementary and secondary school at the time.
The city's largest university, The <a>University of Memphis</a>, was not founded until 1912.
Although <a>Rhodes College</a> claims a founding date of 1848, it did not actually move to Memphis until 1925, some 54 years after the founding of Christian Brothers, making it the youngest of the major colleges in Memphis.
Rhodes' original 1848 campus became <a>Austin Peay State University</a>, and Rhodes became &quot;Southwestern at Memphis.&quot;</p>

<p><a>right|thumb|250px|Buckman Hall</a> In 1953, the decision was made to expand the community college into a four-year institution to better serve the needs of the community.
The four-year curriculum began with degrees in <a>Business Administration</a> and <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, with the first graduates in recent times receiving their degrees in 1955.</p>
<p>The curriculum was soon expanded to meet the needs for new programs in the fields of <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> and <a>Chemistry</a>.
The following degree programs were later added: <a>Biology</a>, <a>Civil Engineering</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Chemical Engineering</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Natural Science</a>, <a>Engineering Physics</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, and Religion and Philosophy.
Teacher preparation programs in secondary education were added in 1969.
An accelerated evening program offering a degree in Business Administration was added in 1978 to meet the needs of the adult student, and the <a>Applied Psychology</a> degree was added in 1999.
<p>Programs at the graduate level were reinstated in 1987 with the Master's program in Telecommunication and Information Systems.
The <a>Master of Business Administration</a> and the <a>Master in Engineering Management</a> were added in 1989.
A <a>Master of Education</a> was added in 1997, and the <a>Master of Arts in Teaching</a> and Master of Science in Educational Leadership were offered beginning in 2001.
The Master of Arts in Executive Leadership was added in 2005.</p>
<p>When another Catholic college in Memphis (the all-female <a>Siena College</a>) closed,  Christian Brothers University became <a>coeducation</a>al in 1970.

Painting The Rock is spray painting an on-campus boulder, usually to show off one's <a>Greek</a> letters and symbols.</p>
<p>Painting The Rock has its own rules of etiquette.
The Rock can only be painted between sunset and sunrise.
Any group currently next to The Rock is guarding it, and it cannot be taken by another group at that time (although the occasional fight has happened in the past).
The Rock can be painted several times in one night; however, it is a gentlemanly tradition among the fraternities not to paint over a sorority Rock for at least two to three days.</p>
<p>The term <em>taking The Rock</em> refers to adding a completely new coat of paint whereas <em>tagging</em> is just spray painting marks on top of someone else's paint, typically to add the names of the painters or insults to the current holder of The Rock.</p>
<p>Older Rock traditions (until the 1970s) include <strong>paint fights</strong> between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen the first few days of school, but these have been discontinued.</p>
