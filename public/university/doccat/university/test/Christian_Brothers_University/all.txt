established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|120px|left|Saint John Baptist de la Salle</a> <strong>Christian Brothers College</strong> was founded November 19, 1871, by members of the De La Salle Christian Brothers.
established$$$@@@%%%The Brothers came to Memphis at the request of the people and <a>clergy</a> of the city, after more than a decade of efforts to persuade the Brothers to open a college in Memphis.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Christian Brothers University</a> traces its origins to priest and educational innovator, St. John Baptist de la Salle.
established$$$@@@%%%De la Salle began a system of <a>Christian</a> schools in which teachers assist parents in the educational, ethical, and religious formation of their children.
established$$$@@@%%%To continue his <a>spiritual</a> and <a>pedagogical</a> vision, de la Salle founded the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, known today as the De La Salle Christian Brothers.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Today, the spirit and tradition of the Lasallian community thrives in 81 countries and in more than 1,000 educational institutions.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Over 4,000 De La Salle Christian Brothers, along with 56,000 Lasallian <a>lay</a> colleagues (such as Lasallian Volunteers), serve over 750,000 students and their families worldwide.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In the United States, there are over 100 <a>Lasallian educational institutions</a>.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%LeMoyne College (one of the two constituent parts of present-day <a>LeMoyne-Owen College</a>) also claims a founding year of 1871, but it was an elementary and secondary school at the time.
established$$$@@@%%%The city's largest university, The <a>University of Memphis</a>, was not founded until 1912.

established$$$@@@%%%Rhodes' original 1848 campus became <a>Austin Peay State University</a>, and Rhodes became &quot;Southwestern at Memphis.&quot;</p>

motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>Painting The Rock</h3>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Students traditionally &quot;paint The Rock&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%Painting The Rock is spray painting an on-campus boulder, usually to show off one's <a>Greek</a> letters and symbols.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Painting The Rock has its own rules of etiquette.
established$$$@@@%%%The Rock can only be painted between sunset and sunrise.
established$$$@@@%%%Any group currently next to The Rock is guarding it, and it cannot be taken by another group at that time (although the occasional fight has happened in the past).
established$$$@@@%%%The Rock can be painted several times in one night; however, it is a gentlemanly tradition among the fraternities not to paint over a sorority Rock for at least two to three days.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The term <em>taking The Rock</em> refers to adding a completely new coat of paint whereas <em>tagging</em> is just spray painting marks on top of someone else's paint, typically to add the names of the painters or insults to the current holder of The Rock.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Older Rock traditions (until the 1970s) include <strong>paint fights</strong> between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen the first few days of school, but these have been discontinued.</p>
