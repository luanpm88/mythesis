<p>The <strong>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (UC or PUC)</strong> () is one of the six <a>Catholic Universities</a> existing in the Chilean university system and one of the two <a>Pontifical Universities</a> in the country, along with the <a>Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara&#x00ed;so</a>.
Since it is a Pontifical University, it has always had a strong and very close relationship with the <a>Vatican</a>.
It was founded on June 21, 1888 through a decree issued by the <a>Santiago</a> <a>Archbishop</a>.
Its first chancellor was <a>Monsignor</a> <a>Joaqu&#x00ed;n Larra&#x00ed;n Gandarillas</a>, and at the very beginning, the university only taught two subjects, <a>law</a> and <a>mathematics</a>.
It is part of the <a>Universities of the Rectors' Council of Chilean Universities</a>, and although it is not <a>state-owned</a>, a substantial part of its budget is given by state transferences under different concepts.</p>
<p>Its business school was ranked 8th in South America in the 2010 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a>.</p>
<p>UC has four campuses in <a>Santiago</a> and one campus in <a>Villarrica</a>.
<p>These four campuses have a total of 223,326.06 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; constructed in a 614,569.92
<h2>History</h2>
<p>UC was founded on June 21, 1888, to offer training in traditional professions (law) and in technological and practical fields such as business, accounting, chemistry, and electricity.
On February 11, 1930, <a>Pope Pius XI</a> declared it a <a>pontifical university</a>, and in 1931 it was granted full academic autonomy by the Chilean government.
It is a private, urban, multi-campus university.
It is one of the eleven Chilean Catholic universities, and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Rectors' Council (<em>Consejo de Rectores</em>), the Chilean state-sponsored university system.</p>
These centers carry out technical-academic extension activities in rural and agricultural areas.
<p>UC 's Graduates of the School of Architecture (one of the most prominent in Latin America) have also made important contributions to the country with such work as the Central Building (&quot;Casa Central&quot;) of UC, and the National Library.</p>
Both of them studied in the School of Laws.
<p>The Department of Industry and System Engineering is engaging <a>Stanford Technology Venture Program</a> of <a>Stanford University</a> on a collaboration on innovation and technology ventures.</p>
