<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1939 the Pranete Silpakam School was founded on the grounds of Thapra Palace, just north of the Grand Palace, by <a>Mom Luang</a> <a>Pin Malakul</a>.
Four years later, during <a>World War II</a>, it became Thailand's third government university.
<p>In 1968 the Royal Thai Ministry of Education granted permission for Silpakorn University to include additional majors, which led to the establishment of the <a>Sanam Chan Palace</a> campus in <a>Nakhon Pathom</a>, west of Bangkok.
Later, when more faculties were added, the Phetchaburi campus was built.
Located on the coast southwest of Bangkok, it is known as the &quot;Phetchaburi IT campus.&quot;</p>
