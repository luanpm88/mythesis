<p>Founded in 1911 as an education college, the university is composed of seven colleges offering over 60 degree programs through 35 departments.
It is currently the second-largest institution of higher learning in Tennessee by enrollment, trailing only the <a>University of Tennessee</a> at <a>Knoxville</a>, and has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the state.
<p>MTSU is part of the <a>Tennessee Board of Regents</a>, and is <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> Commission on Colleges.
<h2>History</h2>
The major thrust of this &quot;improvement&quot; embodied in the legislative act that was to become known as the General Education Bill of 1909 was the establishment of three normals or teacher-training institutions.
Following the intent of the act that one was to be located in each of the grand divisions of the state, the State Board of Education assigned the middle Tennessee institution to Murfreesboro.</p>
<p>Opening on September 11, 1911, with a two-year program for training teachers, Middle Tennessee State Normal School evolved into a four-year teachers college in 1925 with the power of granting the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree.
In 1943, the General Assembly designated the institution a state college.
This new status marked a sharp departure from the founding purpose and opened the way for expanding curricular offerings and programs.
In 1965, the institution was advanced to university status.</p>
<p>During the progressive movement from a two-year normal to a university, several significant milestones may be identified.
In 1936, the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> program was added.
Responding to the expressed needs of the institution's service area, the Graduate School was established in 1951.
To effect better communications and improve administrative supervision, the schools concept was introduced in 1962.</p>
<p>As Middle Tennessee State University developed and grew, the <a>Doctor of Arts</a> program was added in 1970 and the <a>Specialist in Education</a> in 1974.
These two degree programs became attractive centerpieces for other efforts to improve and enhance institutional roles.
Library resources were dramatically increased and sophisticated computer services were developed to aid instruction and administration.
A highly trained faculty enabled the University to continue growth in program offerings.
In 1998, MTSU's <a>Honors Program</a> became the Honors College, the first in the state.
In 2002, approval was granted to redesignate three D.A. programs to Doctor of Philosophy programs, expanding the progressive institution's offerings.</p>
<p>Since 1911, MTSU has graduated more than 90,000 students.
Despite the University's growth from a campus of , 125 students, and a faculty of 19, to an academic city of over , more than 26,000 students, and a faculty of over 800, the institution is still essentially a &quot;people's university&quot; with a concern for the diverse needs of the area that it serves.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the institution dedicated resources to become a leader in technology, both in the classroom and in many services to students.
In 1986, <a>James McGill Buchanan</a> ('40) became the first MTSU alumnus to be awarded the Nobel Prize.
Buchanan received the <a>Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> for his pioneering role in the development of the field of <a>public choice</a>, a way of studying the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>MTSU is divided into eight colleges: [[Image:MTSU James E Walker Library.JPG|right|230px|thumbnail|[[James E. Walker Library]]]]</p>
<li>College of Graduate Studies</li>
<li>College of Mass Communication</li>
<li>Jennings A. Jones College of Business</li>
<p>The College of Graduate Studies offers Master's degrees in nine areas, the Specialist in Education degree, and the Doctor of Arts degree.
MTSU's first Ph.D. was awarded in May 2003, though the university had awarded many Doctor of Arts degrees in the past.</p>
<p><a>150px|thumb|left|The Mass Communications building at MTSU</a> The Department of Recording Industry (often called &quot;RIM&quot; for its former name &quot;Recording Industry Management&quot;) is a department in the College of Mass Communications and the university's most popular program.
Due to the large number of students in the program, only a limited number of slots are opened for students to gain candidacy to take upper-division classes.
The Production and Technology concentration focuses on recording, mixing, and mastering techniques, and specific technological trends of the industry.
Commercial Songwriting is a blend of music business, songwriting, and music theory classes.</p>
<p><a>Rolling Stone</a> recognized MTSU as having &quot;one of the preeminent music business programs in the country,&quot; and <a>SPARS</a> has noted that &quot;the faculty [of the recording program] are impressive and first rate.&quot;</p>
The Department of Aerospace has a working agreement with the single-runway Murfreesboro Airport to provide many of its classes on-site.
A decommissioned <a>Boeing 727</a> airliner (number N117FE, donated by <a>FedEx</a>) is housed at the airport as a teaching tool.
Though no longer considered air-worthy, its engines remain functional, and can be restarted for training purposes.
<a>American Airlines</a> has also donated a 727 cockpit procedure trainer to MTSU, which allows students to receive their flight engineer rating.
It is housed in the Business &amp; Aerospace Building near the center of campus.
The aerospace program's training fleet is made up of <a>Diamond DA40</a> single-engine aircraft featuring <a>glass cockpit</a>s, with an assortment of other single- and multi-engine aircraft available.. In 2010, the Department of Aerospace purchased ten radar simulators as well as a one-of-a-kind 360 degree control tower simulator to enhance training for its air traffic control students.
These simulators allow students to experience life-like air traffic control scenarios that will aid in preparing them for training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>The Concrete Industry Management program is a four year bachelor of science degree offered through the Engineering Technology and Industrial Studies department in the College of Basic and Applied Sciences.
It was started in 1996 by industry professionals and companies to meet the demand for educated professionals in an expanding and changing industry.
CIM at MTSU was the first of its kind in the country.
Other CIM programs have since started at <a>Arizona State University</a> and <a>New Jersey Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
<p><a>135px|thumb|right|Walnut Grove behind the site of the old library building at MTSU</a> The campus, set on 466 acres (1.9&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), features 109 permanent buildings with 3.8 million square feet (353,000 m&#x00b2;) of space.
The campus is mostly flat, much like the landscape of Murfreesboro.</p>
<p>The campus takes the general shape of a rectangle and automobile traffic is mostly confined to the campus perimeter.
Parking lots for students border these streets on the outer perimeter of campus.</p>

The new KUC and College of Education Building is currently being erected on the west side of campus between Cummings Hall and the Recreation Center.
<p>The eastern part of campus houses the main quadrangle of MTSU, encompassing the Learning Resource Center, the Business and Aerospace Building, the Mass Communications Building, and the <a>James E. Walker Library</a>.
On the far east of campus lies the Paul W. Martin Honors Building, Ezell and Abernathy Halls, the recreation center, and two apartment complexes - Scarlett Commons and Womack Lane.
On the very extreme east of campus facing Rutherford Boulevard lies Greek Row.</p>
15% of MTSU's students live in on campus.
A large majority of students live in apartment complexes surrounding the university.
No sorority houses have opened at MTSU. [[Image:Autumn in the library quad at Middle Tennessee State University.jpg|thumb|The
