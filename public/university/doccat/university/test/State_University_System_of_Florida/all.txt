established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Florida Board of Governors was created in 2003 to centralize the administration of the State University System of Florida.
established$$$@@@%%%Previously Florida's State University System had been governed by the <a>Florida Board of Regents</a> (1965&#x2013;2001) and the <a>Florida Board of Control</a> (1905&#x2013;1965).

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to 1905, Florida's state institutions were governed by a Board of Education and even earlier variations thereof, reaching back to the <a>Florida</a> Constitution of 1838 wherein higher education and normal education was established, based on grants of land from the <a>U.S. Congress</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%From 1905 to 1965, the few universities in the system were governed by the <a>Florida Board of Control</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Board of Control was replaced by the <a>Florida Board of Regents</a> in 1965, to accommodate the growing university system.
established$$$@@@%%%The Board of Regents governed until it was disbanded by the <a>Florida Legislature</a> in 2001, and its authority was divided between the <a>Florida Board of Education</a> (which was given some authority over all levels of public education in the state), and appointed university boards of trustees, which operated independently for each separate institution.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2002, Floridians led by <a>U.S. Senator</a> <a>Bob Graham</a> passed an amendment to the <a>Florida Constitution</a> establishing a new statewide <a>governing body</a>, the <a>Florida Board of Governors</a>.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 2008-2009 academic year, the State University System enrolled 301,135 total students.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In total 233,772 undergraduates, and 56,872 graduate and professional students..
established$$$@@@%%%Each campus maintains its own library catalog and also shares an agreement for library reciprocal borrowing.
established$$$@@@%%%The agreement was called the Florida Distance Learning Iniative and was signed on February 9, 1999.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>The physical collections are scattered across each of the SUS campuses.
country$$$@@@%%%Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed in the main article.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to organizational differences, having more libraries does not directly translate into a higher volume of specific collections of materials.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>During Florida's 2007 Legislative Session, <a>Governor</a> <a>Charlie Crist</a> signed into law SB-1710 which allowed the <a>Florida Board of Governors</a> to charge Tuition Differential of 40% above and beyond the regular in-state <a>undergraduate</a> <a>tuition rates</a> for the <a>University of Florida</a> and <a>Florida State University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition the <a>University of South Florida</a> was allowed to raise its rates 30% above and beyond the regular in-state undergraduate tuition charges.
campus$$$@@@%%%This was allowed because these three institutions reached Research Flagship benchmarks that the other universities in the State University System could not achieve.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2008, in lieu of receiving increased research funding in excess of $100 million, the Tuition Differential was allowed to now include the <a>University of Central Florida</a> and <a>Florida International University</a>.
mascot$$$@@@%%%These two institutions were allowed to raise their in-state undergraduate tuition rate 30% above and beyond the regular tuition rates.
established$$$@@@%%%This legislation ultimately created a multi-tier system for higher education in <a>Florida</a>'s State University System of Florida.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2009, Governor Charlie Crist and the <a>Florida Legislature</a> passed an even broader tuition differential for all of the institutions within the State University System of Florida.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The new provision allows for a 15 percent annually tuition increase for in-state undergraduate tuition until they reach the national average.
established$$$@@@%%%Governor Crist signed off on the legislation on June 1, 2009.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The expanded tuition differential is not covered by the <a>Bright Futures Scholarship Program</a>, and the stipulation states that 30 percent of the added revenue must go to <a>need-based student financial aid</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This legislation was passed due to severe budget restrains caused by the <a>Florida</a> economy.</p>
