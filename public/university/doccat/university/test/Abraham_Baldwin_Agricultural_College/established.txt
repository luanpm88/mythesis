It is a part of the <a>University System of Georgia</a> and is named for <a>Abraham Baldwin</a>, the first <a>president</a> of the <a>University of Georgia</a>, <a>Georgia</a>'s first <a>university</a>.</p>
<p>Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College was established in 1908 as the <strong>Second District A&amp;M School</strong>, became <strong>South Georgia A&amp;M College</strong> in 1924 and <strong>Georgia State College for Men</strong> in 1929.
Named for a signer of the <a>United States Constitution</a> and the first president of the University of Georgia, the college assumed its present name in 1933 when it became a unit of the University System of Georgia.
At that time ABAC embarked on a mission devoted primarily to associate-level studies in agriculture, home economics, and related fields.
The college offers 40 college transfer programs in which students move on to four-year colleges and universities after their ABAC careers are complete.
It is respected throughout the golf industry and offers students the opportunity to both study theory and put their knowledge into practice at the learning facility owned by Forest Lakes Golf Club.</p>
The college has a radio station, WPLH, an Honors program, and the Arts Connection which helps bring arts and cultural events to Tift and surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Many ABAC students live on campus in the ABAC Place apartments, the largest housing project of its kind at a two-year college in America.
The apartment-style housing, as opposed to the traditional on campus dorms which were demolished starting in 2004, is notable because it is managed by the Student Life and Housing Office rather than a third-party management company.
The ABAC Lakeside facility is the newest, offering suite-style rooms to freshmen.
<p>The college recently changed sectors from two-year to state college, making it an institution that can offer two-year and four-year programs.
Four-year programs include a bachelor's degree in Rural Studies.</p>
