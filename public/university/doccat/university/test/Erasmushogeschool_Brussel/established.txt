<p>The <strong>Erasmushogeschool Brussel</strong> (English name: <em>Erasmus University College Brussels</em>) is an institute of higher education based in <a>Brussels</a>, <a>Belgium</a>.
<p>Like the EU student exchange programme <a>ERASMUS</a>, Erasmus University College Brussels is named after the humanistic philosopher and author <a>Desiderius Erasmus</a>, who resided in <a>Anderlecht</a>, a municipality of <a>Brussels</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Flemish Higher Education Decree of 13 July 1994 ushered in a large-scale merger operation and reorganisation of the educational system (disciplines and curricula).
More than 160 institutions were reduced to 22 colleges.
Erasmus University College Brussels came into being in 1995 from a merger of some ten colleges in and around Brussels.</p>
<p>Together with the <a>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a> (Free University of Brussels), in 2003 Erasmus University College Brussels created the Universitaire Associatie Brussel (Brussels University Association) to bring the master&#x2019;s degree programmes in line with the academic requirements of the <a>Bologna declaration</a>.</p>
