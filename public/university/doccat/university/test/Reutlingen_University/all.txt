established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The history of Reutlingen University goes back to the School of Weaving established in 1855 by the <a>Kingdom of W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>, the city of Reutlingen, and the textile industry.
established$$$@@@%%%The school was renamed in 1891 and became the Technical College for Spinning, Weaving, and Knitting.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1908, the Technical college received state recognition and changed its name once more to the State Technical College for the Textile Industry.
established$$$@@@%%%Two years later, the State Testing and Examination Authority for Textiles was founded in Reutlingen.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1967, <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> was added to the State Technical College, and in 1971, the College received <a>official recognition</a> as a <a>Fachhochschule</a> (University of Applied Sciences).
established$$$@@@%%%In the Department of Business Studies, the first course in International Business began.
established$$$@@@%%%A year later, the business course &quot;Fertigungswirtschaft&quot; (Production Management) enrolled its first students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Work began on the new Hohbuch campus in 1975, and the Fachhochschule moved there in 1977.
established$$$@@@%%%The old buildings in the center of town were handed over to the police force, and parts of the original equipment from the Weaving School and other documentation were placed in the Industrial Museum.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1979, the &quot;Europ&#x00e4;isches Studienprogramm f&#x00fc;r Betriebswirtschaft&quot; (<a>ESB</a>), with partner schools in <a>London</a> and <a>Reims</a>, enrolled its first students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Today's Building 2, home to the School of <a>Applied Chemistry</a> and University Administration, opened in 1983, and in 1984, the first students entered Automation Technology and Business Information Science classes.
established$$$@@@%%%The same year, the Export Academy Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg was founded at the Fachhochschule with a postgraduate degree course in International Marketing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The largest building on campus, Building 1 (<em>Betriebshalle</em>) opened in 1987 by the <a>Minister-President of Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a> with space for Reutlingen University's technology departments.

students$$$@@@%%%This means that the traditional German university degree &quot;<a>Diplom</a>...&quot; is being phased out.
