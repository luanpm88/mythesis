<a>Raja Ram Mohan Roy</a> showed full sympathy for the scheme but chose not to come out in support of the proposal publicly for fear of &quot;alarming the prejudices of his orthodox countrymen and thus marring the whole idea&quot;.</p>
<p>The proposal to set up a new college called the Calcutta College, or the Metropolitan College, open to students from all communities had already been mooted, but this would have meant greater financial liability for the government, which would also have to provide it with a competent faculty.
In 2001, the department celebrated 100 years of UG teaching.
The department has a good teacher-student ratio.
At this occasion Row suggested that the Club could be called 'Athletic', due to its excellent infrustructural facilities.</p>
Several eminent academics of the second half of the twentieth century, many of whom joined the government and/or have or still are teaching in the finest world universities were regulars at the Coffee House.
<p> The former students of this college are still the best and the brightest in India and abroad.
