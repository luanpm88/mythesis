<h2>History</h2>
Quinnipiac University () was founded in 1929 by Samuel W. Tator, a business professor and politician.
Judge Phillip Troup, a <a>Yale College</a> graduate, and Tator's wife, Irmagarde Tator, a <a>Mount Holyoke College</a> graduate, also played major roles in the fledgling institution's founding and nurturing;the former became its first president until his death in 1939; the latter, its first bursar.
<p>Quinnipiac was conceived in reaction to <a>Northeastern University</a>'s abandonment of its <a>New Haven, Connecticut</a> program at the onset of the <a>Great Depression</a>.
Originally, Quinnipiac was located in New Haven and called Connecticut College of Commerce.
On opening its doors in 1929, it enrolled under 200, and its first graduating class featured only eight students.
In 1935, the college changed its name to Junior College of Commerce.</p>
<p>From 1943-1945, the college closed; nearly its entire student body was drafted into <a>World War II</a>.
<p>In 1951, the institution was renamed Quinnipiac College, in honor of the <a>Quinnipiac</a> Indian tribe that once inhabited <a>Greater New Haven</a>.
That same year, Quinnipiac began to confer <a>bachelor's degrees</a>.
In 1952, Quinnipiac expanded rapidly, both physically and in terms of curriculum, relocating to a larger campus in New Haven, and also assuming administrative control of Larson College, a private women's college.</p>
<p>In 1966, after having outgrown its campus in New Haven, Quinnipiac moved to its current campus in <a>Hamden, Connecticut</a>'s Mount Carmel section, at the foot of <a>Sleeping Giant Park</a>.
During the 1970s, Quinnipiac began to offer <a>master's degrees</a> in a variety of disciplines.
In 1995, the <a>University of Bridgeport</a>'s law school migrated to Quinnipiac.
The Quinnipiac School of Law Center was dedicated later that year as well.
Also, during the mid-1990s, Quinnipiac's communication and business programs, respectively, built state-of-the-art facilities and attracted nationally-known professors.
Quinnipiac's Polling Institute was noted for excellence by several prominent journalistic outlets, and often cited during the 1998 and 2000 election campaigns.</p>
On July 1, 2000, the school officially changed its name to Quinnipiac University&mdash;to reflect its relatively new breadth in academic offerings.
That same year, Quinnipiac University received accreditation by <a>AACSB</a>.
Its new medical school plans to admit students starting in 2013.
<p>The university operates several media outlets, including a professionally-run, commercial radio station <a>WQUN</a>, founded by journalist and Quinnipiac professor Lou Adler.
The university also operates a student-run FM radio station <a>WQAQ</a>, which concurrently streams on the Internet.
A student-run television station, <a>Q30</a>, can be viewed only on campus.
The collection is contained in the Lender Family Special Collection room located in the Arnold Bernhard library.</p>
<p>The oldest of these campuses is the Mount Carmel campus, at the foot of the <a>Sleeping Giant</a> State Park.
<p>The York Hill, located on a hill about a half-mile from the Mount Carmel campus, began with the development of the <a>TD Bank Sports Center</a>.
In 2010 this was joined by a new student center as well as expanded parking and residence facilities as part of a $300 million expansion of the  campus.
<p>In 2007, Quinnipiac acquired a  campus in <a>North Haven, Connecticut</a> from <a>Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield</a>, and has been gradually converting it for use by graduate programs at the university.

<p><strong>Arnold Bernhard Library</strong> - The library is named for Arnold Bernhard, the founder and former chief executive officer of Value Line, Inc. Bernhard's son made the library renovation project possible by donating $1 million for the library project and an additional $3 million for the University's endowment in 1997.
The donation was the largest in University history.
The signature clock tower was replaced during the renovation which changed the icon of the school, which was a futuristic looking rocket ship spire, to a more conservative, modern tower.
<p><strong>Ed McMahon Mass Communications Center</strong> - The Ed McMahon Mass Communications Center is a media production facility equipped with up-to-date technology for hands-on training in all aspects of radio, television, journalism and multimedia production.
<p>In the late 2000s the men's basketball team gained a greater following than before under new head coach <a>Tom Moore</a>, a disciple of <a>UConn Huskies</a> men's basketball coach <a>Jim Calhoun</a>.).</p>
<p>On July 21, 2010, a federal judge ruled that Quinnipiac violated <a>Title IX</a> of the <a>Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> by failing to provide equal treatment to women's athletic teams.
The judge determined that Quinnipiac's decision to eliminate the women's volleyball team, its attempt to treat cheerleading as a competitive sport, and its manipulation of its reporting with regard to the numbers of male and female athletes amounted to unlawful discrimination against female students.</p>
<p>The problems began in the Fall 2007 semester, when junior Jason Braff, then editor of the <em>Quinnipiac Chronicle</em>, the official newspaper of the school, openly criticized a university policy that forbade the <em>Chronicle</em> from publishing news online before the content was published in the weekly <a>print edition</a>.
Manuel Carreiro, Quinnipiac's vice president and dean of students, then sent a letter to Braff in November, telling him that his public disagreement with school policies &quot;will seriously place your position and organization at risk with the university.&quot;
Braff received an $8,000 annual stipend for his position, and the university said that its employees have more of a responsibility than other students to uphold policies.
<p>Quinnipiac officials agreed to discuss the policies with students, and eventually decided that making the <em>Chronicle</em> independent from the university would be the best idea.
The school set forth a plan of action, which included the university appointing editors for the 2008-2009 academic year.
<p>Former <em>Chronicle</em> staffers came back in Fall 2008 with <em>Quad News</em>, an independent newspaper with only a <a>website</a> and no print edition.
<em>Quad News</em> immediately faced opposition from the university.
Shortly after, officials threatened to shut down the university's chapter of the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> (SPJ), claiming that they violated school policy by using their meetings as a cover for <em>Quad News</em> meetings.
The move prompted a public letter from national SPJ leaders, expressing concern over the university's actions.
