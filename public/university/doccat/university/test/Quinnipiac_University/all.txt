established$$$@@@%%%Quinnipiac University () was founded in 1929 by Samuel W. Tator, a business professor and politician.
established$$$@@@%%%Judge Phillip Troup, a <a>Yale College</a> graduate, and Tator's wife, Irmagarde Tator, a <a>Mount Holyoke College</a> graduate, also played major roles in the fledgling institution's founding and nurturing;the former became its first president until his death in 1939; the latter, its first bursar.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Quinnipiac was conceived in reaction to <a>Northeastern University</a>'s abandonment of its <a>New Haven, Connecticut</a> program at the onset of the <a>Great Depression</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally, Quinnipiac was located in New Haven and called Connecticut College of Commerce.
established$$$@@@%%%On opening its doors in 1929, it enrolled under 200, and its first graduating class featured only eight students.
affiliation$$$@@@%%%At the time, it awarded only <a>associate's degrees</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1935, the college changed its name to Junior College of Commerce.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From 1943-1945, the college closed; nearly its entire student body was drafted into <a>World War II</a>.
students$$$@@@%%%Upon re-opening, the college's enrollment nearly quadrupled to approximately 800 students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1951, the institution was renamed Quinnipiac College, in honor of the <a>Quinnipiac</a> Indian tribe that once inhabited <a>Greater New Haven</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%That same year, Quinnipiac began to confer <a>bachelor's degrees</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1952, Quinnipiac expanded rapidly, both physically and in terms of curriculum, relocating to a larger campus in New Haven, and also assuming administrative control of Larson College, a private women's college.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1966, after having outgrown its campus in New Haven, Quinnipiac moved to its current campus in <a>Hamden, Connecticut</a>'s Mount Carmel section, at the foot of <a>Sleeping Giant Park</a>.

image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>Student journalism controversy</h2>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>Quinnipiac has been at the center of controversy over the university's control over <a>student publications</a> and students' <a>speech</a>.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The conflict has drawn national attention.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The problems began in the Fall 2007 semester, when junior Jason Braff, then editor of the <em>Quinnipiac Chronicle</em>, the official newspaper of the school, openly criticized a university policy that forbade the <em>Chronicle</em> from publishing news online before the content was published in the weekly <a>print edition</a>.
image_size$$$@@@%%%&lt;!--Comment from QU--&gt; Braff wrote an <a>editorial</a> about the policy and also gave an interview to the <em><a>Republican-American</a></em> criticizing it.
established$$$@@@%%%Manuel Carreiro, Quinnipiac's vice president and dean of students, then sent a letter to Braff in November, telling him that his public disagreement with school policies &quot;will seriously place your position and organization at risk with the university.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Braff received an $8,000 annual stipend for his position, and the university said that its employees have more of a responsibility than other students to uphold policies.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%But Lynn Bushnell, QU's vice president for public affairs, denied threatening to fire Braff for disagreeing with school policies.
type$$$@@@%%%Braff and the <em>Chronicle</em> staff were also openly critical of a public relations policy requiring all news media inquiries and questions (including those from the <em>Chronicle</em>) for administrators to be sent, via e-mail, to the university's public relations department.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Quinnipiac officials agreed to discuss the policies with students, and eventually decided that making the <em>Chronicle</em> independent from the university would be the best idea.
established$$$@@@%%%The school set forth a plan of action, which included the university appointing editors for the 2008-2009 academic year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Angry with this plan, Braff and other staff agreed to leave the <em>Chronicle</em> at the end of the spring 2008 semester, and all applicants for the editor positions withdrew their applications.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Former <em>Chronicle</em> staffers came back in Fall 2008 with <em>Quad News</em>, an independent newspaper with only a <a>website</a> and no print edition.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Plans are to incorporate <em>Quad News</em> as its own business venture run on <a>advertising</a> revenue.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>Quad News</em> immediately faced opposition from the university.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Staffers learned in September that university officials had instructed all varsity coaches, staff and athletes not to speak to <em>Quad News</em> reporters.
established$$$@@@%%%Shortly after, officials threatened to shut down the university's chapter of the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> (SPJ), claiming that they violated school policy by using their meetings as a cover for <em>Quad News</em> meetings.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The <em>Quad News</em> staff had used two SPJ meetings to meet, after the university took away <em>Quad News</em> meeting reservation, citing the fact that the organization was not a university-recognized club.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<em>Quad News</em> promptly stopped their meetings with SPJ.
established$$$@@@%%%The move prompted a public letter from national SPJ leaders, expressing concern over the university's actions.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Both staffs recognize the other publication as legitimate and have wished each other luck in their friendly competition.</p>
