type$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>HEC Paris</strong> or <strong>&#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales de Paris</strong> is a French <em><a>Grande Ecole</a></em>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> and has become one of the world's foremost <a>business school</a>s.
established$$$@@@%%%It has been consistently ranked the best business school in Europe by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em> since the ranking's inception.</p>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>HEC is among the few <em>Grandes Ecoles</em> which educate France's top executives and political elite.
established$$$@@@%%%It has many notable alumni in business and politics, including members of the current French government, the <a>director-general</a> of the <a>WTO</a> and the <a>IMF</a> <a>president</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In 2010, 10 of the 40 largest French publicly traded companies have an alumnus of HEC Paris as CEO (or equivalent).
established$$$@@@%%%With regards to the number of <a>CEO</a>s of <a>Fortune Global 500</a> companies, HEC would be ranked the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; higher education institution in the world, and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Grande &#x00e9;cole</a> programme (<a>MSc in Management</a>) is known for its very competitive entrance exam (<em>concours</em>).
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Fewer than 4% of French students attending the dedicated and selective undergraduate curriculum (see <a>preparatory classes</a>) are admitted each year.
type$$$@@@%%%Because of this selection, HEC is regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in France together with the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> (engineering) and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> (sciences and literature) which have similar recruitment processes.</p>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>HEC also offers well-ranked MBA, Executive MBA, MSc and specialized master programmes, as well as Ph.D. degrees.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Together with leading parisian schools of engineering such as the <a>Ecole Polytechnique</a>, HEC is a constituent of the <a>Paris Institute of Technology</a> (ParisTech), an association of top Grandes Ecoles willing to create a collegiate university by the year 2020.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Overview</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>History</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1819, the <a>&#x00c9;cole sup&#x00e9;rieure de commerce de Paris</a> became the first business school created in the world.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Yet, many of the most prestigious French <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a> already existed.
established$$$@@@%%%For example, the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> were created during the <a>French Revolution</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Most business schools were created decades later, at the end of the 19th century, and were less attractive than universities.
established$$$@@@%%%Established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce</a> (CCIP), the &#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales (HEC) wanted to be in the fields of <a>management</a> and <a>trade</a> what <a>Centrale Paris</a> was in the field of <a>engineering</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In order to gain recognition from the academic world, the school offered lessons similar to what was taught in secondary education and few classes in management.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Despite its ambition and the quality of its teachers (often chosen among prestigious Parisian <a>academics</a>), the school was considered as a second chance for <a>upper-class</a> children who did not want to attend university and a way to shorten compulsory <a>military service</a> (one year instead of three).
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, HEC suffered from a lack of attractiveness at least until the 1930s.
established$$$@@@%%%Created in 1892, the entrance examination was removed between 1906 and 1913.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1921, the school introduced the <a>case-based method</a> of the <a>Harvard Business School</a>, but most of lectures remained theoretical.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1938, HEC program was lengthened to 3 years.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The problem of attractiveness disappeared after <a>world war two</a>, due to French corporation demand for North American style management education.
established$$$@@@%%%At the end of the 1950s the case-based method is generalized and a one-year <a>classe preparatoire</a> is created to prepare the entrance examination which had become difficult.
established$$$@@@%%%An evidence of the recognition of the diploma is that only 9% of HEC students also attended university in 1959, whereas 47% had done so in 1929.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1964, French President <a>Charles de Gaulle</a> inaugurated a new  wooded campus in <a>Jouy-en-Josas</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1967, HEC launched its executive education programs.
former_names$$$@@@%%%At that time, the CCIP wanted HEC to become an <a>MBA</a> school like Harvard.
established$$$@@@%%%Since the alumni opposed this project, the CCIP established a new school in 1969, the Institut Sup&#x00e9;rieur des Affaires (ISA).
nickname$$$@@@%%%Yet HEC and ISA joined forces in the &quot;Centre d'enseignement sup&#x00e9;rieur des affaires&quot; the following year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This group changed its named to &quot;Groupe HEC&quot; in 1989.</p>
athletics$$$@@@%%%<p>Women have been accepted at HEC only since 1973.
established$$$@@@%%%Only 27 girls were accepted that year and &quot;<a>HEC jeunes filles</a>&quot; (<a>HECJF</a>), another school dedicated to women, disappeared.
established$$$@@@%%%Its alumni are officially considered as graduated from HEC. HECJF alumni include, for example, <a>&#x00c9;dith Cresson</a>, the first and to date the only woman to have held the office of <a>Prime Minister of France</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1970s, HEC began to become global.
established$$$@@@%%%It signed a partnership with the <a>New York University</a> and the <a>London School of Economics</a> in 1973, and has recruited foreign students since 1975.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1988, HEC founded the <a>CEMS</a> network with <a>ESADE</a>, the <a>Bocconi University</a> and the <a>Cologne University</a>.</p>
