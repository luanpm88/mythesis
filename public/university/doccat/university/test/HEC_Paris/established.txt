It was established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> and has become one of the world's foremost <a>business school</a>s.
It has been consistently ranked the best business school in Europe by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em> since the ranking's inception.</p>
It has many notable alumni in business and politics, including members of the current French government, the <a>director-general</a> of the <a>WTO</a> and the <a>IMF</a> <a>president</a>.
With regards to the number of <a>CEO</a>s of <a>Fortune Global 500</a> companies, HEC would be ranked the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; higher education institution in the world, and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe.</p>
<p>The <a>Grande &#x00e9;cole</a> programme (<a>MSc in Management</a>) is known for its very competitive entrance exam (<em>concours</em>).
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 1819, the <a>&#x00c9;cole sup&#x00e9;rieure de commerce de Paris</a> became the first business school created in the world.
For example, the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> were created during the <a>French Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Most business schools were created decades later, at the end of the 19th century, and were less attractive than universities.
Established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce</a> (CCIP), the &#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales (HEC) wanted to be in the fields of <a>management</a> and <a>trade</a> what <a>Centrale Paris</a> was in the field of <a>engineering</a>.
In order to gain recognition from the academic world, the school offered lessons similar to what was taught in secondary education and few classes in management.</p>
<p>Despite its ambition and the quality of its teachers (often chosen among prestigious Parisian <a>academics</a>), the school was considered as a second chance for <a>upper-class</a> children who did not want to attend university and a way to shorten compulsory <a>military service</a> (one year instead of three).
As a result, HEC suffered from a lack of attractiveness at least until the 1930s.
Created in 1892, the entrance examination was removed between 1906 and 1913.</p>
<p>In 1921, the school introduced the <a>case-based method</a> of the <a>Harvard Business School</a>, but most of lectures remained theoretical.
<p>The problem of attractiveness disappeared after <a>world war two</a>, due to French corporation demand for North American style management education.
At the end of the 1950s the case-based method is generalized and a one-year <a>classe preparatoire</a> is created to prepare the entrance examination which had become difficult.
An evidence of the recognition of the diploma is that only 9% of HEC students also attended university in 1959, whereas 47% had done so in 1929.</p>
<p>In 1964, French President <a>Charles de Gaulle</a> inaugurated a new  wooded campus in <a>Jouy-en-Josas</a>.
In 1967, HEC launched its executive education programs.
Since the alumni opposed this project, the CCIP established a new school in 1969, the Institut Sup&#x00e9;rieur des Affaires (ISA).
Only 27 girls were accepted that year and &quot;<a>HEC jeunes filles</a>&quot; (<a>HECJF</a>), another school dedicated to women, disappeared.
Its alumni are officially considered as graduated from HEC. HECJF alumni include, for example, <a>&#x00c9;dith Cresson</a>, the first and to date the only woman to have held the office of <a>Prime Minister of France</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, HEC began to become global.
It signed a partnership with the <a>New York University</a> and the <a>London School of Economics</a> in 1973, and has recruited foreign students since 1975.
In 1988, HEC founded the <a>CEMS</a> network with <a>ESADE</a>, the <a>Bocconi University</a> and the <a>Cologne University</a>.</p>
<li><strong>Business School</strong>: the business school as a whole has been ranked 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe by the Financial Times before the <a>London Business School</a> since 2006.
<a>Mines ParisTech</a>, which publishes an annual study on the educational background of CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies, ranks HEC Paris 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the world, and 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe before <a>Oxford University</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Grande Ecole &#x2013; MSc in Management</strong>:
The school was ranked 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; three times in the last five years.
<li><strong>Executive MBA</strong>: HEC offers a joint EMBA with the <a>London School of Economics</a> and the <a>NYU Stern School of Business</a> which is constantly ranked among the top 3 programmes worldwide by the <em>Financial Times</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Executive Education</strong>: the last ranking of the <em>Financial Times</em> ranks HEC second to <a>Harvard Business School</a> for its Executive Education programmes.</li>
<h2><em>Grande Ecole</em> (MSc in Management)</h2>
<p>The <a>Master of Science in Management</a>  is HEC's leading program.; it was ranked number one in the world by the <em>Financial Times</em>  from 2005 to 2008.
In 2010, HEC was ranked second to <a>ESCP Europe</a>, the other top ranked business school of the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce</a>.
Yet, during the last five years, 1,633 students from preparatory classes were admitted to both HEC and ESCP and only 2 chose ESCP.</p>

They are considered as a <em>royal way</em> in the French higher education system, except for Law and Medical studies.</p>
For a minimum of two years, <em>pr&#x00e9;parationnaires</em> study an average of 58 hours per week.
<p>The <em>concours</em> includes at least an examination in each subject studied and both written and oral examinations.
Depending on how many schools students apply to, written examinations spread over two of three weeks.
Among them, only 4,506 were candidates to HEC, the others preferring to focus on less selective schools.
Among those 4,506 candidates, only 700 were invited to oral examinations, and 382 were offered admission.
<p>French graduates with a <em>Licence</em> (<a>Bachelor's degree</a>) can also apply for admission to the Grande Ecole programme.
<p>The <a>International Admissions Service</a> manages the recruitment tests and interviews on behalf of HEC and three other Grandes Ecoles in France.
Admission to this programme requires a degree gained upon successful completion of at least three years of university education outside France in any field.</p>
<p>Admitted students enroll directly in the second year of the programme.</p>
<a>Wharton</a>, <a>Bocconi University</a>, <a>Trinity College</a>, <a>University of British Columbia</a>...) .
They can also enroll in a specific one-year program to get a Bachelor's degree from a French university (see below).</p>
Courses include corporate and market finance, accounting, marketing, law, mathematics, management, <a>human resources</a>, and <a>supply chain</a>.
At the end of their second year, students choose specific majors, and must pass through a by far less competitive application process.</p>
