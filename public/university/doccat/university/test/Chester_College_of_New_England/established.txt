<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was founded in 1965 as <strong>White Pines College</strong> by Faith Preston, Ed.D., who sought to create a post-secondary learning environment that focused on the needs of the individual student in a way that larger institutions could not.
The first class was admitted in 1967.
The name was changed in 2002 when the college expanded from a 2-year program to a 4-year college.
<p>The college features a low student-to-faculty ratio (12:1), artist- and writer-in-residence programs, and a program of guest lectures, exhibitions, art and photography exhibits, internships, and relationships with professional associations.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2007, Dr. William Nevious stepped down as the college's president after five years at the helm.
Nevious was credited with orchestrating unprecedented growth during his time at Chester College.
On June 22, former Manchester Mayor <a>Robert Baines</a> was named interim president.
He served half a year before announcing his intention to remain as permanent president.
