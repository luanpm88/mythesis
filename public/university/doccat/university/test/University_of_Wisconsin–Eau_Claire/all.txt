established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
doctoral$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|350px|First Faculty Members at UW-Eau Claire.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%The University was founded in 1916 as the <em>Eau Claire State <a>Normal School</a></em>, offering one-, two- and three-year teachers' courses and a principals' course.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1927, the name of the school was changed to the <em>Eau Claire State Teachers College</em> and the school began offering a bachelor's degree program.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus was also altered to accommodate a 300-man <a>detachment</a> from the <a>Army Air Corps</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1951, the Wisconsin <a>Board of Regents</a> of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> authorized the school to offer bachelor of arts and science degrees in <a>liberal arts</a>; subsequently, the name of the school was changed to the <em>Wisconsin State College at Eau Claire</em>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1964 the Board of Regents gave university standing to the state colleges, and the institution at Eau Claire was renamed <em>Wisconsin State University &#x2013; Eau Claire</em>.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|right|President John F. Kennedy at Eau Claire.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%Finally, in 1971 the name of the institution was changed to the <em>University of Wisconsin &#x2013; Eau Claire</em> following the merger of the <a>Wisconsin State University System</a> and the University of Wisconsin System.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Park School</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In its former role as a college primary for student-teachers, there was an Eau Claire School District building operated on-site, for both teaching elementary school children and for allowing new teachers to see how classes were taught without interfering with the daily operation and goings-on of the classrooms.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The building has an unusual two story design with a hidden third story balcony area, looking down into about eight of the upper story classrooms.
established$$$@@@%%%This allowed college professors and students to observe the operation of the classrooms from above, with one-way mirrored glass preventing elementary students from seeing their audience.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>However due to the changing educational focus of the university, this method of teaching new teachers fell out of use and the Park Elementary School was closed.
established$$$@@@%%%Most of the building was repurposed for general university classroom use, with about a third of the space dedicated to a child daycare center.
established$$$@@@%%%The building is scheduled for demolition in approximately 2014, to be replaced with a new building more in line with the university's current needs.</p>
