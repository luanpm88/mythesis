<h2>History</h2>
The University was founded in 1916 as the <em>Eau Claire State <a>Normal School</a></em>, offering one-, two- and three-year teachers' courses and a principals' course.</p>
<p>In 1927, the name of the school was changed to the <em>Eau Claire State Teachers College</em> and the school began offering a bachelor's degree program.
The campus was also altered to accommodate a 300-man <a>detachment</a> from the <a>Army Air Corps</a>.</p>
<p>In 1951, the Wisconsin <a>Board of Regents</a> of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> authorized the school to offer bachelor of arts and science degrees in <a>liberal arts</a>; subsequently, the name of the school was changed to the <em>Wisconsin State College at Eau Claire</em>.</p>
<p>In 1964 the Board of Regents gave university standing to the state colleges, and the institution at Eau Claire was renamed <em>Wisconsin State University &#x2013; Eau Claire</em>.
Finally, in 1971 the name of the institution was changed to the <em>University of Wisconsin &#x2013; Eau Claire</em> following the merger of the <a>Wisconsin State University System</a> and the University of Wisconsin System.</p>
<p>In its former role as a college primary for student-teachers, there was an Eau Claire School District building operated on-site, for both teaching elementary school children and for allowing new teachers to see how classes were taught without interfering with the daily operation and goings-on of the classrooms.</p>
<p>The building has an unusual two story design with a hidden third story balcony area, looking down into about eight of the upper story classrooms.
This allowed college professors and students to observe the operation of the classrooms from above, with one-way mirrored glass preventing elementary students from seeing their audience.</p>
<p>However due to the changing educational focus of the university, this method of teaching new teachers fell out of use and the Park Elementary School was closed.
Most of the building was repurposed for general university classroom use, with about a third of the space dedicated to a child daycare center.
The building is scheduled for demolition in approximately 2014, to be replaced with a new building more in line with the university's current needs.</p>

<li>UW&#x2013;Eau Claire was the center of a controversy related to an oak tree sacred to <a>Native Americans</a>.
The tree, officially known as the Council Oak, was the symbol of the UW&#x2013;Eau Claire campus (found on the university's seal) and the meeting place for many Native American tribes negotiating truces.
Plans to build a new <a>student center</a> put the oak tree in danger and many Native American groups in conjunction with students protested the new plan.
Eventually, after much publicity, it was decided to scrap the old plans and build the 48.8 million dollar building at another location.</li>
<li>The university was the center of a debate on <a>academic freedom</a> after officials denied a dorm leader the right to direct a <a>Bible study</a> in his <a>dormitory</a>.
Officials said that it was inappropriate for a dormitory leader to have a Bible study because it might make non-Christian students uncomfortable.
The student then sued the university and was eventually successful in ending the policy.
This debate was widely publicized in part because the <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> was deeply involved in the case.</li>
<li><a>Newsweek</a> ran a <a>satirical</a> article criticizing the election of former Iraqi President <a>Saddam Hussein</a> who was purported to have received 100 percent of the Iraqi vote.
