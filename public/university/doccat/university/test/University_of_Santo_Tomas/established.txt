<p>The <strong>Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines</strong> (colloquially <strong>UST</strong> or &quot;Ust&#x00ea;&quot;. <a>Filipino</a>: <strong>Unibersidad ng Santo Tomas</strong>), is a private <a>Roman Catholic</a> university run by the <a>Order of Preachers</a> in <a>Manila</a>.
Founded on April 28, 1611 by archbishop Miguel de Benavides, it has the oldest <a>extant</a> university charter in the <a>Philippines</a> and in <a>Asia</a>.
As a <a>Pontifical University</a> in Asia, UST is the only university to have been visited by two popes three times: once by <a>Pope Paul VI</a> on Nov. 28, 1970, and twice by <a>Pope John Paul II</a> on Feb. 18, 1981 and January 13, 1995.</p>
<p>The University is composed of several autonomous faculties, colleges, schools and institutes, each conferring undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees, and the basic education units.
Several degrees have been <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Commission on Higher Education</a> as Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development.</p>
<p>The Patron of the University is <a>St.
Catherine of Alexandria</a> is the Patroness.
<p>Prominent <a>Thomasians</a> include <a>saint</a>s, Philippine <a>president</a>s, <a>hero</a>es, artists, scientists, professionals and religious figures, who have figured prominently in the <a>history of the Philippines</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>  The foundation of the University is ascribed to <a>Miguel de Benavides</a>&lt;!--
He came to the Philippines with the first <a>Dominican</a> mission in 1587.
He went on to become bishop of Nueva Segovia, and was promoted archbishop of Manila in 1601.
Upon his death in July 1605, Benevides bequeathed his library and personal property worth 1,500 pesos to be used as the seed fund for the establishment of an institution of higher learning.
Bernardo de Santa Catalina carried out Benavides&#x2019; wishes and was able to secure a building near the Dominican church and convent in <a>Intramuros</a> for the College.</p>
<p>In 1609, permission to open the College was requested from King <a>Philip III of Spain</a>, which only reached Manila in 1611.
On April 28, 1611, notary Juan Illian witnessed the signing of the act of foundation by Baltazar Fort, OP, Bernardo Navarro, OP, and Francisco Minayo, OP.
Fort, appointed that year to the post of Father Provincial, was its first Rector.
<p>The <strong>Colegio de Nuestra Se&#x00f1;ora del Sant&#x00ed;simo Rosario</strong> was established on April 28, 1611, from the Benavides's library.
Later renamed <strong>Colegio de Santo Tom&#x00e1;s</strong>, it was elevated by <a>Pope Innocent X</a> to a university on November 20, 1645 in his brief, <em>In Supreminenti</em>.
This made the university the second royal and pontifical institution in the Philippines, after the Jesuit's Universidad de San Ignacio which was founded in 1590 but closed in the 1768 following the expulsion of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its complete name is <strong>The Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines</strong> ().
It was given the title &quot;Royal&quot; by King <a>Charles III of Spain</a> on 1785; &quot;<a>Pontifical</a>&quot; by <a>Pope Leo XIII</a> on 1902 in his constitution, <em>Quae Mari Sinico,</em> and the appellative &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot; by <a>Pope Pius XII</a> on 1947.</p>
<p>The university was located within the walled city of <a>Intramuros</a> in <a>Manila</a>.
It was started by the Spanish <a>Archbishop of Manila</a> in the early 17th century as a <a>seminary</a> for aspiring young priests, taking its name and inspiration from Saint <a>Thomas Aquinas</a>, a Dominican theologian.
In 1871, it began offering degrees in Medicine and Pharmacy, the first in colonized Asia.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1611, the University's academic life was interrupted only twice: from 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, and from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the country.
In its long history, the university has been under the leadership of more than 90 Rectors.
<h2>The University seal</h2>
<p>The seal of the University of Santo Tomas is a shield quartered by the Dominican Cross.
Superimposed on the cross is the sun of <a>Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>, patron of Catholic schools, after whom the university is named.
<li>On the upper left is the <a>papal tiara</a>, indicating that the UST is a <a>pontifical university</a>.</li>
<li>The upper right shows the lion derived from the <a>seal of Spain</a>, indicative of royal patronage throughout the greater part of the university's centuries-old existence.</li>
<li>The rose on the lower right is a symbol of the <a>Blessed Virgin Mary</a> under whose patronage the university was placed from its very beginnings.</li>
<p>The <strong>Tongues of Fire</strong> is the official logo for the Quadricentennial celebration of the university.
This logo features the outline of the UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university.
From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out <strong>U</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, and <strong>T</strong>.
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|University of Santo Tomas in Espa&#x00f1;a, Manila</a> The University sits on an almost perfect square of 21.5 hectares bounded by <a>Espa&#x00f1;a Boulevard</a>, P.Noval, A.H. Lacson and Dapitan St, in <a>Sampaloc</a>, <a>Manila</a>.
The University transferred to its present campus in 1927 when the Dominicans deemed the <a>Intramuros</a> Campus Inadequate for the University's growing population.
<p>The Campus, at present boasts a mixture of old and new architecture with the inclusion of the UST Multi-Deck carpark which houses the <a>Alfredo M. Velayo College of Accountancy</a>, and the proposed UST Sports Complex, the 2nd Modern Sports facility to be constructed by a <a>UAAP</a> member school.
Other new structures include the Beato Angelico Building which houses the <a>College of Architecture</a> and <a>College of Fine Arts and Design</a>, the Plaza Mayor, the UST Quadricentennial Square and Alumni Park, Thomas Aquinas Research Complex and the UST - Tan Yan Kee Student Center.
<a>right|thumb|250px|UST Quadricentennial Square</a> The University has started to develop upcoming campuses in <a>Santa Rosa City</a> (60 hectares), <a>General Santos City</a> (80 hectares), and <a>Negombo</a>, <a>Sri Lanka</a>, (5 hectares).
The University is also in the process of establishing a presence in Mongolia.
In 2011, the University will be celebrating its 400th founding anniversary, and it is projected that the new campuses will be operational by then.

<li><strong>Plaza Mayor</strong>, a concreted plaza in front of the Main Building.
It used to be a street and parking spaces.</li>
<p>The <strong><a>UST Elementary School</a></strong> used to offer primary education for children in the <a>K-12</a> levels, but before the Quadricentennial Celebration of the University, the school started denying applications from the K-Level, until the last batch of Grade 6 students who would graduate on AY 2010-2011 are left.
The UST Elementary School, after finishing the last batch of its students in the UST Sampaloc Campus, will be transferred to the new UST Campus in <a>Santa Rosa City</a>, <a>Laguna</a>.</p>
<p>UST has two secondary institutions: The <strong><a>UST High School</a></strong> and the <strong><a>UST Education High School</a></strong> which serves as a laboratory for the College of Education.</p>
<p>All students of these institutions undergo Citizenship Advancement Training, while the students from first to third year level of the <a>UST High School</a> undergo scouting under the <a>Boy Scouts of the Philippines</a> for the boys and the <a>Girl Scouts of the Philippines</a> for the girls.

The &quot;Faculties&quot; were founded before the American occupation of the early 20th century, while the &quot;Colleges&quot; were founded during and after American rule.
The <strong>Faculty of Canon Law</strong> was founded in 1733.
These three original faculties are now known as the <strong><a>Ecclesiastical Faculties</a></strong>, to distinguish them from the <strong>Secular Faculties and Colleges</strong> that were founded later.
<p>The <strong><a>Faculty of Medicine &amp; Surgery</a></strong> together with the <strong><a>Faculty of Pharmacy</a></strong> were founded on the same year in 1871.

<p>The national hero of the Philippines, <a>Jos&#x00e9; Rizal</a>, studied here before moving to <a>Madrid Central University</a> to complete his studies.
This was highly controversial, as many professors complained that students were not learning the basic sciences adequately.
Eventually, in 2003 the curriculum was changed again, this time to an innovate format which combined elements of both traditional (lecture-based) and problem-based methods.</p>
<p>The Faculty is known for giving its fourth-year students a series of written and oral exams known as the &quot;revalida&quot;.
Passing the revalida is a prerequisite to graduation.</p>
It has been consistently producing topnotchers in the annual national licensure exams for Filipino physicians and it is proud of its Level 4 National Accreditation for several years.
It is also the <a>alma mater</a> of numerous Secretaries of Health of the Philippines, as well as several Presidents of the Philippine Medical Association, the national organization of medical doctors in the country.
The Faculty was also ranked as the only Asian medical school to be in the top 10 list of foreign medical institutions by the U.S. Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in 2007.</p>
<p>As early as the 17th century postgraduate degrees were offered and granted by the various faculties in the University.
In 1938, the <strong><a>UST Graduate School</a></strong> was established to administer and coordinate all the graduate programs in the University.
Today the UST Graduate School is recognized as a Center of Excellence in several fields of the Arts and Humanities, Allied Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Engineering by the Commission on Higher Education.
