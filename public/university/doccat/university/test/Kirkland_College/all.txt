established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Kirkland College</strong> was a small, private <a>liberal arts</a> <a>women's college</a> located in <a>Clinton</a>, <a>New York</a> from 1968 to 1978.
established$$$@@@%%%It was named for <a>Samuel Kirkland</a>, who founded <a>Hamilton College</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Hamilton absorbed Kirkland on June 30, 1978 and now maintains its archives and <a>financial endowment</a>, and supports its alumnae community.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Planning for Kirkland began during the 1962-1963 <a>academic year</a>, with assistance from then-<a>Hamilton College</a> president <a>Robert W. McEwen</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was named after <a>Samuel Kirkland</a>, the founder of Hamilton.
established$$$@@@%%%Since Hamilton was a <a>men's college</a> prior to 1978, Kirkland College, a college for women, was envisioned as the first of several institutions which would form a cluster similar to the <a>Claremont Colleges</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Though that vision was never achieved two factors led to a more innovative and experimental nature at Kirkland: first, the introduction of progressive views of undergraduate education on the part of Millicent C. McIntosh, former President of <a>Barnard College</a>, and second, the mandate to &quot;start from scratch&quot; without regard to the more traditional patterns at Hamilton, a mandate embraced by Kirkland's president, Samuel F. Babbitt.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The untimely passing of Hamilton President McEwen led to the abandonment of the multiple coordinate colleges plan.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<p>Kirkland opened in 1968 on its own campus located adjacent to Hamilton College.
established$$$@@@%%%The Kirkland faculty and students operated in a more diverse and transparent community than had been the norm at Hamilton, and there were many differences that led to small and large conflicts between the two institutions.
established$$$@@@%%%Meantime, the economic climate, which had been very positive during the planning stages for Kirkland, began to deteriorate.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, the debt service accruing to build Kirkland's entirely new campus exerted a tremendous burden on its finances.
established$$$@@@%%%It was forced to turn to Hamilton for relief.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1977, Hamilton refused such relief, and the two colleges were merged under protest  into a single, coeducational Hamilton in 1978.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A recent book (published in 2007) by Samuel Fisher Babbitt, Kirkland's only president, <em>Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1978, An Intimate History of the Rise and Fall of a Coordinate College for Women</em>, provides an in-depth, first person account of Kirkland's brief existence.
established$$$@@@%%%In additional to personal records and recollection, Babbitt was able to employ archival material housed in the Hamilton College and Columbia University libraries.

affiliation$$$@@@%%%<h2>Legacy at Hamilton College</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When Kirkland was officially incorporated into and absorbed by Hamilton College in 1978, many continuing students elected to join the new co-ed college, and some faculty accepted equivalent positions in Hamilton's departments.
established$$$@@@%%%Yet discontent with the way the merger was executed festered long after 1978, coloring both alumnae relations, inter-faculty relations and, to some degree, campus social dynamics.
type$$$@@@%%%Despite such friction, many of the educational principles of Kirkland (such as student-designed majors and independent study) found their way into the Hamilton curriculum.
established$$$@@@%%%Efforts on the part of both Kirkland and Hamilton alumni to acknowledge common interests have begun to mend these breaches by responding to the curiosity and interests of current Hamilton students regarding Kirkland and its influence on their college .</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Endowment</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Upon the dissolution of Kirkland, its endowment was transferred to the Hamilton endowment, with existing restrictions intact, with the understanding that all funds were to be applied &quot;to support women and their needs and interests at Hamilton.&quot;
country$$$@@@%%%One on-going Hamilton program that received early support from the Kirkland Endowment is HAVOC (Hamilton Association for Volunteering, Outreach and Charity, .)</p>

doctoral$$$@@@%%%During commencement exercises at Hamilton many students and faculty choose to wear a green apple pin on their academic robes to honor Kirkland's legacy.
president$$$@@@%%%Many graduating seniors also place green apples on the podium prior to receiving their diplomas.</p>
motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Kirkland Project</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the mid-1990s, the a group of Hamilton faculty initiated a project with the intention of working &quot;toward establishing a research center like the Bunting Institute at Harvard and the Pembroke Center at Brown.&quot;
