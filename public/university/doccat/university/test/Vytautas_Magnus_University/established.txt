<p><strong>Vytautas Magnus University (VMU)</strong> ((VDU)) is a public university in <a>Kaunas</a>, <a>Lithuania</a>.
The university was founded in 1922 during the <a>interwar period</a> as an alternate <a>national university</a>.
Initially it was known as the <strong>University of Lithuania</strong>, but in 1930 the university was renamed to <em>Vytautas Magnus University</em>, commemorating 500 years of death of <a>Vytautas the Great</a>, the Lithuanian ruler, well known for the nation's <a>greatest historical expansion</a> in the 15th century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment of University</h3>
<p>The beginnings of <a>higher education</a> in <a>Lithuania</a> go back to the 16th century when, in 1579, the college founded by <a>Jesuits</a> in <a>Vilnius</a> became a higher school of education - <em>Academia et Universitas Vilnensis</em>.
In 1832 in the aftermath of the <a>November Uprising</a> <a>Czar</a> <a>Nicholas I</a> closed the university.

<p>However, in 1918, with the establishment of the independent Republic of Lithuania, the <a>State Council</a> decided to reestablish the <a>Vilnius University</a>.
Since Vilnius was later under Polish administration and the Lithuanian government had to be transferred to Kaunas, this decision was not put into effect.</p>
<p><a>thumb|300 px|Professors of Vytautas Magnus University (1930)</a> At the beginning of 1920, <strong>Higher Courses of Study</strong> were established in Kaunas, laying the foundation for the establishment of a university.
The <a>Lithuanian Cabinet of Ministers</a> decided to establish the University of Lithuania in Kaunas, February 13, 1922.
The ceremonial opening of the university took place February 16, 1922, while on the 12th of April the <a>President of Lithuania</a> confirmed the university's Statute along with six <a>faculties</a>: <a>Theology</a>-<a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Law</a>, <a>Mathematics</a> and <a>Science</a>s, <a>Medicine</a> and Technical Studies.
<p>The affiliate Agricultural Academy was founded in 1924 on the basis of the Agronomy and Forestry sections of the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences; in 1936 the Veterinary Academy was established in a similar fashion on the basis of the Veterinary section of the Faculty of Medicine.
<p>On June 7, 1930 commemorating 500 years of the death of Lithuanian politician the university was named <a>Vytautas the Great</a> University ().</p>
<p>In 1940 Vytautas the Great University helped to reestablish the University of Vilnius: in the winter the Faculties of Humanities and Law were transferred to Vilnius, and in the summer, the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences.
The occupation of Lithuania by the <a>Soviet Union</a> forced the university to be named the <strong>University of Kaunas</strong> in the summer of 1940.
At the beginning of 1941 university professors took an active part in establishing the <a>Lithuanian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Lithuanian Provisional Government</a> restored the name of Vytautas the Great to the university in the summer of 1941, after the <a>Soviet</a> - <a>Nazi Germany</a> war broke out.
The German occupation government closed the university in March 1943, after Lithuanians refused to form an <a>SS</a> battalion.
<p>The University was reopened in the fall of 1944 with four faculties: History-Philology, Medicine, Construction, and Technology.
The transfer of the Faculty of <a>Philosophy</a> to <a>Vilnius</a> was the reason why the University of Kaunas was closed in the fall of 1949.
The university was reorganized into <a>Kaunas Polytechnic Institute</a> and the <a>Kaunas Medical Institute</a> in October 31, 1950.</p>
<h3>Reestablishment of University</h3>
<p>The act of reestablishing Vytautas Magnus University was proclaimed April 28, 1989.
The <a>Supreme Council of Lithuania</a> passed the law reestablishing the university July 4, 1989, while the Council of Ministers registered the temporary Statute for the university's period of reestablishment on the 22nd of July.
The first academic year began in the university's reestablished Faculties of Economics, Humanities and Sciences September 1, 1989.
<p>The reestablished university was the second in then <a>Soviet</a>-occupied Lithuania, and the first school of higher education that was independent of governmental institutions.
The most important principle in the university's activity became academic freedom, while its main purpose was to prepare graduates with a broad humanistic orientation for Lithuania's needs in research, culture, education and economy.
<p>A common program of study in humanities and general education for the first two years of study for all students appeared in 1990.
Its aim was to develop well-rounded individuals who were free and creative.
<p>In 1991 the university was the first in Lithuania to establish in a system of study based on several levels, the completion of which resulted in the granting of <a>Bachelor's</a> or <a>Master's degree</a>s, as well as the <a>Doctoral degrees</a>.
<p>The students themselves put together their plan of study and make a final choice of their program after the first two years of study.
Particular attention is given to foreign languages and computer skills thus making this university different from other schools of higher education in the country.
<p>During the university's first decade the number of students and teachers grew more than twenty times.
<p>Master's and Doctoral studies became a priority at the university and demanded a pedagogical staff with high qualifications.
Ten Lithuanian research institutes formed this association together with the university: the Institutes for Lithuanian <a>History</a>, <a>Lithuanian Language</a>, Lithuanian <a>Literature</a> and <a>Folklore</a>, Lithuanian <a>Philosophy</a> and <a>Sociology</a>, <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>Mathematics</a> and <a>Informatics</a>, Semiconductor <a>Physics</a>, <a>Psychophysiology and Rehabilitation</a>, <a>Architecture</a> and <a>Civil Engineering</a>, and Lithuanian <a>Forestry</a>.
<p>The university has the right to grant doctoral degrees in nineteen scholarly fields and their branches and the Doctor Habilitus in eight fields.
The pedagogical titles of professor and associate professor may be granted in the fields of Humanities, Social Sciences, Physics and Biomedicine.</p>
<p>The university has ties with numerous universities of <a>North America</a> and <a>Europe</a>, as well as <a>East Asia</a>.
