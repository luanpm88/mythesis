<p> <a>thumb|300px|right|Palm trees line the entrance to UPLB</a> The <strong>University of the Philippines Los Ba&#x00f1;os</strong> (<strong>UP Los Ba&#x00f1;os</strong>, <strong>UPLB</strong> or colloquially <strong>&quot;Elbi&quot;</strong>) is a public university located in the towns of <a>Los Ba&#x00f1;os</a> and <a>Bay</a> in the province of <a>Laguna</a>, some 63 kilometers south of <a>Metro Manila</a>.
It was founded by <a>American</a> <a>botanist</a> <a>Edwin B. Copeland</a> on March 6, 1909 as the <a>University of the Philippines College of Agriculture</a> (UPCA)-the first school of its kind in the <a>tropics</a> and the second oldest among the seven campuses affiliated with the <a>University of the Philippines</a> system.</p>
<p>UPLB has played an influential role in Asian <a>agriculture</a> and <a>biotechnology</a> due to its pioneering efforts in <a>plant breeding</a> and <a>bioengineering</a> focusing on the development of high-yielding and pest resistant crops.
It has received a <a>Ramon Magsaysay Award</a> (regarded as Asia's <a>Nobel Prize</a>)</p>
The <a>Professional Regulation Commission</a> also recognizes UPLB as a top performing school based on passing rates in professional <a>licensure</a> exams.</p>
Notable ones include national scientists, United Nations <a>IPCC</a> members (winner of the 2007 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a>), Ramon Magsaysay awardees, fellows of the <a>Academy of Sciences for the Developing World</a>, academicians of the National Academy of Science and Technology, business leaders, government officials and artists.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Seeing the need to set up an institution dedicated to research and education in <a>agriculture</a> and related disciplines to serve the new <a>colony</a>, the <a>Board of Regents</a> of the <a>American</a> <a>University of the Philippines</a> on March 6, 1909 established the College of Agriculture in <a>Los Ba&#x00f1;os, Laguna</a>.
<a>Edwin B. Copeland</a>, a <a>plant physiology</a> <a>professor</a> and <a>Thomasite</a> from the <a>Philippine Normal College</a> in Manila was chosen as its first <a>dean</a>; Harold Cuzner, Edgar Ledyard, Carrie Ledyard and Sam Durham were Copeland&#x2019;s first academic staff.
Classes were first held in June 1909 in the houses of faculty members and makeshift tents.
A year later, structures for the college were completed in a 73-hectare abandoned <a>farmland</a> at the foot of <a>Mount Makiling</a>.
A formal four-year <a>curriculum</a> was instituted in 1910.</p>
<p> The UPCA campus was chosen as an internment camp for <a>allied</a> nationals as well as a recuperative camp for Filipino war prisoners during the <a>Japanese occupation</a>, with Baker Hall as main internment building.</p>
<p>The campus became home to 8,146 <a>POW</a>s: 7,000 <a>Filipinos</a>, 1,527 <a>Americans</a>, 329 <a>British</a>, 133 <a>Australia</a>ns, 89 <a>Dutch</a>, 30 <a>Norwegians</a>, 22 <a>Poles</a>, 16 <a>Italians</a>, and 1 <a>Nicaragua</a>n during the occupation.
Aside from twelve <a>US Navy</a> <a>nurses</a> and a few <a>servicemen</a>, most of the internees were civilian <a>businessmen</a>, <a>teachers</a>, <a>bankers</a>, and <a>missionaries</a> caught by the Japanese during the course of the war and incarcerated in various <a>POW</a> camps in the country.</p>
<p>In 1945 the Americans saw the need to rescue the prisoners in Los Ba&#x00f1;os.
With the help of Filipino guerrillas and escaped prisoners, a rescue mission was carried out from February 21 to 23, 1945.
<p>A few days after the rescue, Japanese units led by the escaped Sadaaki Konishi returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os.
After seeing that the prisoners have escaped, the Japanese turned their wrath on the remaining civilians who had failed to heed the warning from the guerrillas to leave.
With the help of pro-Japanese Filipinos known as <a>Makapili</a>, the soldiers massacred some 1,500 men, women and children and burned their houses.
Konishi was eventually captured, tried, and sentenced to death by a war tribunal.</p>
<p>Despite the thousands of innocent civilians killed when the Japanese returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os after the raid, it is nonetheless celebrated as one of the most successful rescue operations in modern military history.</p>
<p>UPCA became the first unit of the <a>University of the Philippines</a> to open after the war when it resumed classes on July 25, 1945.
In five years, with the help of war damage funds from the US, 80% of the physical plant had been restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Commission on Higher Education has accredited the following programs as Centers of Excellence/Development (as of Oct 2010): Its <a>land grants</a> in <a>La Carlota, Negros Occidental</a> and <a>Quezon Province</a>, which includes portions of the <a>Sierra Madre</a> mountain range, also have similar facilities.</p>
It also has a <a>meteorological station</a>, agricultural machinery development and testing center, <a>geographical information system</a> and <a>remote sensing</a> centers, broadcasting facilities for AM and FM, pet and animal clinics, experimental animal farms and other complementary facilities.
<a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), <a>Cornell University</a>, <a>Yale University</a>, <a>Purdue University</a> among others.</p>
The university also has a strong but controversial partnership with American biotech giant <a>Monsanto</a> in the development of <a>genetically modified organisms</a> (GMOs).Indian biotech company <a>Mahyco</a> likewise taps the assistance of UPLB for its R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2007, UPLB spent PhP805 million or about US$17.89 million for its research and extension activities, with funds coming from the national government (86%) and UPLB's own income (14%).
In addition, from 2004 to 2007, it likewise received at least PhP572 million or about US$12.71 million in research grants from external (local and foreign) sources, given either directly to the university or through the UPLB Foundation.</p>
<p>UPLB has the most number of scientific journals listed at <a>Thomson Scientific</a>/<a>Institute for Scientific Information</a> in the country:</p>
<li>The Philippine Agricultural Scientist (<a>ISSN</a>: 0031-7454), College of Agriculture</li>

<li>Philippine Journal of <a>Veterinary Medicine</a> (<a>ISSN</a>: 0031-7705), College of Veterinary Medicine.</li>
<p>Nine UPLB research institutes were recognized as Centers of Excellence by virtue of Presidential <a>Decree</a>:&lt;ref name=&quot;UPLB Acads&quot;/&gt;</p>
<li>College of Development Communication and its departments</li>
<li>College of Economics and Management and its departments</li>
<p>The university offers secondary education through the <a>UP Rural High School</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:UPLB PPO at Umali.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]] at DL Umali Hall]] <a>thumb|150px|left|Vega Center, campus shopping and dining center</a> The university is home to hundreds of organizations, ranging from Greek-letter societies to religious groups.
They sponsor plays, musical performances, quiz bees, high school camps, outreach programs and other activities.</p>
<p>The Student Union building houses the office of the campus paper UPLB Perspective, as well as a cafeteria, a duck pin bowling lane, internet stations, a table tennis center, school supplies stores and counseling offices.</p>
The fair was initially held to express opposition to <a>Martial Law</a> under former president <a>Ferdinand Marcos</a>, but has since evolved into the biggest social event on campus.
Popular bands and other artists converge at the Freedom Park to perform before hundreds of students and visitors.
<p>The university maintains its own police force but is dependent on the municipal government and <a>IRRI</a> during fires and other emergencies.
