established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early History</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Seeing the need to set up an institution dedicated to research and education in <a>agriculture</a> and related disciplines to serve the new <a>colony</a>, the <a>Board of Regents</a> of the <a>American</a> <a>University of the Philippines</a> on March 6, 1909 established the College of Agriculture in <a>Los Ba&#x00f1;os, Laguna</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Edwin B. Copeland</a>, a <a>plant physiology</a> <a>professor</a> and <a>Thomasite</a> from the <a>Philippine Normal College</a> in Manila was chosen as its first <a>dean</a>; Harold Cuzner, Edgar Ledyard, Carrie Ledyard and Sam Durham were Copeland&#x2019;s first academic staff.
established$$$@@@%%%Classes were first held in June 1909 in the houses of faculty members and makeshift tents.
established$$$@@@%%%A year later, structures for the college were completed in a 73-hectare abandoned <a>farmland</a> at the foot of <a>Mount Makiling</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A formal four-year <a>curriculum</a> was instituted in 1910.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<h3>World War II</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> The UPCA campus was chosen as an internment camp for <a>allied</a> nationals as well as a recuperative camp for Filipino war prisoners during the <a>Japanese occupation</a>, with Baker Hall as main internment building.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The campus became home to 8,146 <a>POW</a>s: 7,000 <a>Filipinos</a>, 1,527 <a>Americans</a>, 329 <a>British</a>, 133 <a>Australia</a>ns, 89 <a>Dutch</a>, 30 <a>Norwegians</a>, 22 <a>Poles</a>, 16 <a>Italians</a>, and 1 <a>Nicaragua</a>n during the occupation.
established$$$@@@%%%Aside from twelve <a>US Navy</a> <a>nurses</a> and a few <a>servicemen</a>, most of the internees were civilian <a>businessmen</a>, <a>teachers</a>, <a>bankers</a>, and <a>missionaries</a> caught by the Japanese during the course of the war and incarcerated in various <a>POW</a> camps in the country.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1945 the Americans saw the need to rescue the prisoners in Los Ba&#x00f1;os.
established$$$@@@%%%With the help of Filipino guerrillas and escaped prisoners, a rescue mission was carried out from February 21 to 23, 1945.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%2,147 allied civilian and military internees were successfully liberated with minimal casualties.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A few days after the rescue, Japanese units led by the escaped Sadaaki Konishi returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os.
established$$$@@@%%%After seeing that the prisoners have escaped, the Japanese turned their wrath on the remaining civilians who had failed to heed the warning from the guerrillas to leave.
established$$$@@@%%%With the help of pro-Japanese Filipinos known as <a>Makapili</a>, the soldiers massacred some 1,500 men, women and children and burned their houses.
nickname$$$@@@%%%They did the same to residents of adjacent towns suspected of collaborating with the liberators.
established$$$@@@%%%Konishi was eventually captured, tried, and sentenced to death by a war tribunal.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Despite the thousands of innocent civilians killed when the Japanese returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os after the raid, it is nonetheless celebrated as one of the most successful rescue operations in modern military history.</p>
