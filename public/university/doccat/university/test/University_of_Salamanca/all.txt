established$$$@@@%%%<p>On the basis of a papal bull by <a>Alexander IV</a> in 1255, which confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X, the school obtained the title of University, the first in Europe.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The historical phrases <em>Quod natura non dat, Salamantica non praestat</em> (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in latin) and <em>Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet</em> (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the reign of King <a>Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and Queen <a>Isabella I of Castile</a>, the <a>Spanish</a> government was revamped.
established$$$@@@%%%Contemporary with the <a>Spanish Inquisition</a>, the expulsion of the <a>Jews</a>, and the conquest of <a>Granada</a>, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state.
established$$$@@@%%%This involved the massive employment of &quot;letrados&quot;, i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were &quot;licenciados&quot; (university graduates), particularly, of <a>Salamanca</a>, and the newly founded <a>University of Alcal&#x00e1;</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the <a>Consejo de Indias</a> and <a>Casa de Contratacion</a>, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the <a>Spanish Empire in the New World</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While <a>Columbus</a> was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca.
established$$$@@@%%%In the next century, the morality of <a>colonization</a> in the <a>Indies</a> was debated by the <a>School of Salamanca</a>, along with questions of <a>economics</a>, <a>philosophy</a> and <a>theology</a>.</p>

type$$$@@@%%%1550-1650), the quality of academics in Spanish universities declined.

affiliations$$$@@@%%%The centuries old European wide prestige of Salamanca declined.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Like <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>, Salamanca had a number of colleges (<em>Colegios Mayores</em>).
established$$$@@@%%%These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the University.
established$$$@@@%%%By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Today some have been turned into faculty buildings while others survive as halls of residence.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of <a>canon law</a> and <a>theology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the <a>Pontifical University of Salamanca</a>.</p>
