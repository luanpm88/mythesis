<p>It was established on 23 September 1963 by a Saudi royal <a>decree</a> as the <strong>College of Petroleum and Minerals</strong> providing high-level education about petroleum and minerals, two of the most-valuable <a>natural resources</a> in Saudi Arabia.
It was elevated to university status in 1975.</p>
<p>Among <a>Saudi universities</a>, it is highest regarded for excellence in its science and <a>engineering</a> programs.
<p>It is named after <a>King Fahd</a>.
It was renamed to its current name in 1986.</p>
<p>Located in <a>Dhahran</a>, the campus is between the headquarters of the Saudi Arabian oil company, <a>Saudi Aramco</a> and the <a>Dhahran Air Base</a>.
It is near the <a>Persian Gulf</a> and is seven kilometres from <a>Khobar</a> city.
The oil-producing town of <a>Abqaiq</a> is 70 kilometres west, and the oasis city of <a>Al-Hasa</a> is about 130 kilometres south of the campus.

As of the 2010/2011 academic year, the cutoff percentage score for admission was determined to be 84% comprising 20% for the high school certificate, 30% for the general capabilities test (similar to <a>SAT</a>), and 50% for the collective test performances (test of high school's maths, physics, chemistry, English).</p>
<p>All programs of the engineering colleges were evaluated for &quot;<a>Substantial-Equivalency</a>&quot; recognition by the <a>Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a> (ABET).
Accrediting agencies such the ABET, the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a>, the <a>Computer Science Accreditation Board</a> and the <a>National Architectural Accrediting Board</a> require programs or colleges seeking accreditation to have self-assessment.
<p>Preparatory Year Program (Orientation Year) is a mandatory two-semester program for all students admitted to KFUPM before being enrolled in university's regular degree programs.
It is a non-credit program.

<h2>Dhahran Techno-Valley</h2>
It is expected that outstanding services plus recreational activities will add to the vibrancy and networking amongst tenants in the Valley Community.
The Techno-Valley consist of five entities at the KFUPM Dhahran campus: King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Science Park, The Innovation Center, Consulting Services Center, Technology Business Incubator, and Liaison Office.
The valley includes a sixth entity of Sultan Bin AbdulAziz Science &amp; Technology Center (SciTech), located on the shores of the <a>Persian Gulf</a> at nearby <a>Al-Khobar</a> city.</p>
<p>Generally referred to as the KASP, the science park was established in 2002 and is located on a 35-hectare site north of the KFUPM campus.
The park is closely integrated with the university.
With its proximity to the science and engineering colleges, KASP provides considerable interaction between tenant firms and their personnel and university scientists and engineers.
At present,  <a>Schlumberger</a>, <a>Ciba</a>, <a>Yokogawa</a>, <a>Honeywell</a>, <a>UOP</a>, <a>Baker Hughes</a> and <a>JCCP</a> have joined the park.</p>
<p>Creating a world-class environment that aspires innovation and entrepreneurship was the main objective for <a>KFUPM</a> behind establishing Dhahran Techno-Valley.
KFUPM vision for <a>innovation</a> facilitates the flow of technology from university laboratories and research centers to the knowledge-based and technology marketplace.
The Innovation Center supports new concepts from the idea generation stage through the prototyping steps until reaching to the proof of concept and including the intellectual property protection.
<p>The Consulting Services Center facilitate the consulting services for the university faculty to serve the industrial community in  <a>Saudi Arabia</a> which contributes to their professional development and helps the outside community to resolve problems that require high intellectual and  technological background.
It is hoped that such interaction contributes to the professional development of the faculty members and to the university by providing practical applications and state-of-the art course content.
The interaction would improve quality of research and design projects and would provide more training and employment opportunities for students.</p>
<p>The mission of the Liaison Office is to facilitate and promote the University capabilities, expertise and services to the local industries and to be the focal point of contact with the industry/business.</p>
<p>The center is at the corniche of nearby <a>Khobar</a> city on &#x200e;&#x200e;21,700 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The buildings area is 14,100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It &#x200e;consists of seven main show halls, dealing with different sciences and &#x200e;technologies.
The center aims to &#x200e;cultivate the individuals of the Saudi society, especially teenagers, to let them &#x200e;know more about the principles of science, their application, and explanation; it simplifes them by presenting them in an interactive and &#x200e;interesting style, depending on education through entertainment/education through experiment and observation.</p>
The mission of the RI is to serve the nation by conducting client-driven research and development using university resources.
<p>The technical expertise for applied research available in the RI is focused in its seven centers with their sections/labs.</p>
<p>The manpower of the RI as of 1 January 2005 was 258 full-time employees, of whom 53 held PhD degrees, 64 held MS degrees, 50 held BS degrees, and 91 held other credentials.
<p>The library, centrally located in Building 8 and a short walk from most classrooms and laboratories, has an available floor space of nearly 7,000 square meters.
It is an &quot;open-stack&quot; library, allowing users free access to its resources.
To encourage maximum usage, it operates with a minimum of regulations and restrictions.</p>
<p>The current collection of books and bound periodicals totals over 328,000 volumes, 32% in science, 21% in engineering, 24% in humanities, and 23% in social sciences.
It has over 23,000 volumes in Arabic and over 300,000 volumes in English and subscribes to approximately 1,500 periodicals.
