<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on 19 June 1963, the modern Universit&#x00e9; de Moncton is the result of the merger of three colleges: <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Saint-Joseph</a> (<a>Memramcook</a>, 1864), <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge du Sacr&#x00e9;-Coeur</a> (Bathurst, 1999), and <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Saint-Louis</a> (<a>Edmundston</a>, 1946).
In 1989, the Universit&#x00e9; of Moncton founded undergraduate degrees in <a>adult education</a>.

<h3>Faculty of Law</h3>
<p>The <a>University of Moncton's Faculty of Law</a> is one of only three French-language common law schools in Canada.
(The <a>University of Ottawa</a> and <a>McGill University</a> also offer common law degrees in French.)
The school was founded in 1978 in order to respond to the needs of francophone communities outside of Quebec.
As Quebec practices civil law, there was a need to instruct francophone lawyers in common law to practice in other parts of Canada.
The University of Ottawa law school teaches both common and civil law, as does McGill; thus the University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is the only exclusively French, exclusively common law school in Canada.
The school also offers joint degrees: the LLB-<a>MBA</a> (Masters of Business) and LLB-<a>MEE</a> (Masters of Environmental Studies).
<p>The <a>Univerty of Moncton's Faculty of Medicine</a> is the first such francophone school in the <a>Maritimes</a>, outside the province of <a>Quebec</a>.</p>
