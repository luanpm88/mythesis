<h2>History</h2>
<p>Initially originated in 258 CE in Nanjing, and in modern time founded in 1915 in Nanjing, the new capital city of the young government of the <a>Republic of China</a>, National Central University moved to <a>Chungking</a> in 1937 when <a>Sino-Japanese War</a> broke out and returned to <a>Nanjing</a> in 1946.
After the R.O.C. lost control of the Chinese Mainland in 1949, in Nanjing it was renamed <a>National Nanjing University</a> by <a>CCP</a>.
NCU was reinstated in Taiwan in 1962, first as the National Central University Graduate Institute of Geophysics.
In 1968, NCU moved to its current location in the Shuanglianpo (&#x96d9;&#x9023;&#x5761;) district of <a>Jhongli City</a> (&#x4e2d;&#x58e2;&#x5e02;), <a>Taoyuan County</a> (&#x6843;&#x5712;&#x7e23;), and was renamed the National Central University College of Science.
