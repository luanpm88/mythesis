<p>Founded in 1831, <strong>Denison University</strong> is a private, coeducational, and residential <a>college</a> of <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>sciences</a>.
Denison University is located in <a>Granville, Ohio</a>, approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east of <a>Columbus</a>, the state capital.
It is a member of the <a>Five Colleges of Ohio</a>, the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>, and the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|400px|right|A view of Swasey Chapel from the west</a> On December 13, 1831, <a>John Pratt</a>, the college's first president and a graduate of Brown University, inaugurated classes at the Granville Literary and Theological Institution.
Situated on a 200-acre farm south of the village of Granville, it was the first Baptist college west of the Allegheny mountains.
While rooted in theological education, the institution submitted students to the same literary and scientific instruction common to other colleges of the day.
The first term included 37 students, 27 of whom hailed from Granville; nearly half of these students were under fifteen years of age.
The school's first Commencement, which graduated three classical scholars, was held in 1840.</p>
<p>In 1845, the institution, which at this point was male-only, officially changed its name to Granville College.
They also voted to move the college to land then available for purchase in the village of Granville.
<p>In the years leading up to the Civil War, many students and faculty members at Denison University became heavily involved in the anti-slavery movement.
Professor Asa Drury, the chair of Greek and Latin studies, became the leader of a local anti-slavery society, while Bancroft House, now a residential hall, served as a stop on the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p>The roots of coeducation at Denison University began in December 1832 with the establishment of the Granville Female Seminary, founded by <a>Charles Sawyer</a> a year before Oberlin launched the first coeducational college in the United States.
The seminary was superseded by the Young Ladies' Institute, founded in 1859 by Dr. and Mrs. Nathan S. Burton.
The Young Ladies' Institute was sold to Reverend Dr. Daniel Shepardson in 1868 and was renamed the Shepardson College for Women in 1886.
Shepardson College was incorporated as part of Denison University in 1900, with the two colleges becoming fully consolidated in 1927.</p>
<p>In 1887, Denison inaugurated a master's program, with resident graduates pursuing advanced studies in the sciences.
In 1926, the Board of Trustees formalized a new curriculum that would make Denison University an exclusively undergraduate institution.
<p>In the wake of Shepardson College's incorporation, Denison University made plans for enlargement of its campus.
In 1916, the college sought the expertise of the Frederick Law Olmsted &amp; Sons architectural firm, the founder of which had designed Central Park in New York City.
The resulting &quot;Olmstead Plan&quot; laid a foundation for expansion that has remained the guiding aesthetic for subsequent growth, establishing and maintaining a pedestrian-friendly campus, while also preserving scenic views of the surrounding hills and valleys.
Expansion during this period included the acquisiton of land to the north and east, the transfer of Shepardson College to the east ridge of College Hill, and the development of a new men's quadrangle beyond the library.</p>
<h3>Recent History</h3>
<p>While the college's origins were rooted in theological education, Denison University has been a non-sectarian institution since the 1960s.
<p>The first building in the ambitious &quot;Greater Denison&quot; plan, Swasey Chapel, Denison&#x2019;s signature building, stands at the center of the campus.
<p>Built in 1937, Doane Library today houses more than 400,000 books and bound periodicals.</p>
<p>Swasey Observatory, which opened in June 1910, houses a 9-inch refracting telescope as well as two 8-inch reflecting telescopes.</p>
The building originally was constructed in 1904 as a men's gymnasium and later became a student union; today, it is the home of the studio art and art history departments.
They come from 46 states, <a>Washington, DC</a>, and 25 countries.
Over the past several years, Denison University has made great strides in attracting a diverse student population, and multicultural students now represent 25 percent of the current first-year class.
The college's students, faculty and staff were honored in 2008 by the State of Ohio for &quot;promoting understanding, racial unity and the appreciation of diversity.&quot;</p>
<p>The university currently has a 49% acceptance rate; out of 4,720 applicants for the class of 2014, 2,328 were accepted and 625 enrolled.</p>

<p>Health and Counseling Services, located in Whisler Hall on the east side of the campus, has a staff of physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, psychologists and social workers to provide health care to students.</p>
<p>The Lilly Program provides opportunities for students in various settings to reflect upon their career paths and the relationship between their plans and personal values.
The DCGA Student Senate is the primary representative body of students on Denison's campus, and it has been involved in various student initiatives: from postponing quiet hours in the fall of 2007 to drafting the Code of Academic Integrity adopted in the fall of 2009 to encouraging the University President to sign onto the <a>Presidents' Climate Commitment</a>.
<p>The <a>University Programming Council</a> (UPC) is the main programming body on campus.
It annually brings in concerts, comedians, hypnotists, and other forms of entertainment to campus.
Other organizations on campus which bring speakers and films include the <a>Denison Film Society</a> (DFS) and the Denison Lecture Series.</p>
The station was notably featured in <a>American Eagle</a> stores across the country through the summer of 2009.</p>
<p>The Alford Center was established in 1997 through a bequest from local philanthropist John W. Alford.
DCA is the umbrella organization for 24 committees that recruit and train Denison students to volunteer at local community sites.</p>
<p><a>400px|right|thumb|A view of Deeds Field-Piper Stadium from College Hill</a> Denison is a member of the <a>NCAA</a> and the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a> (NCAC).
Denison has won nine (9) consecutive NCAC All-Sports Championships for a total of ten (10) since the founding of the conference in 1984-85.
Denison's other All Sports Championship came in 1985-86, and both the consecutive championships streak and the total of ten represent conference records.</p>
In 2006, 2007, and 2010 the men placed 2nd in the nation; the women's and men's teams each finished in 3rd in the nation in 2008 and again in 2009.
Also, for the first time in school history their #1 doubles team made it all the way to the championship match in the individual national competition.
The women's softball team had a record breaking season in the spring of 2008 also.
They advanced farther in the NCAA tournament than any other team has since softball became a varsity sport at Denison in 1997.
They competed in the regional final against Muskingum College in Glassboro, NJ. and in the final D3 season rankings the softball team was ranked 22nd in the nation.
<p><a>Woody Hayes</a>, later renowned as the head coach at <a>Ohio State University</a>, graduated from Denison in 1935, having served as captain of the football team the previous fall, and served as the university's head football coach from 1946 to 1948.</p>
<p>During the mid-1990s, in an effort to re-brand the college as more of an academic, and less of a party, institution, the college's trustees and then-President Michele Tolela Myers elected to make Denison a &quot;non-residential&quot; Greek system.
The decision turned most of the formerly-residential fraternity houses into general college residential halls, and each chapter was given lounge space in the basement of each respective house for official fraternity functions (including chapter meetings).
The change to a non-residential Greek system, combined with a reduction in the number of fraternities, accounts for most of the reduction in the student Greek participation between the current and historic levels.</p>
<li>The Delta Upsilon house became Taylor House, an &quot;honors&quot; residence hall</li>
<li>The Delta Chi house became Sunset House</li>
<li>The Lambda Chi Alpha house became the Erma and Clark Morrow House, an all-first-year student &quot;living and learning&quot; residence hall</li>
<li>The Phi Delta Theta house became the Preston House</li>
<p>D-Day, the successor to the college's old Scrap Day, is a celebration of the entire college, held twice a year.</p>
<p>Kirtley Mather, Class of 1909, named the tallest peak in Alaska's Aleutian Peninsula &quot;Mt.
<p>Denison has one of the few remaining college cemeteries in Ohio.
