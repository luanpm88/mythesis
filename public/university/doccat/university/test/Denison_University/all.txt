image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding &amp; Early Years</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|400px|right|A view of Swasey Chapel from the west</a> On December 13, 1831, <a>John Pratt</a>, the college's first president and a graduate of Brown University, inaugurated classes at the Granville Literary and Theological Institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Situated on a 200-acre farm south of the village of Granville, it was the first Baptist college west of the Allegheny mountains.
established$$$@@@%%%While rooted in theological education, the institution submitted students to the same literary and scientific instruction common to other colleges of the day.
established$$$@@@%%%The first term included 37 students, 27 of whom hailed from Granville; nearly half of these students were under fifteen years of age.
established$$$@@@%%%The school's first Commencement, which graduated three classical scholars, was held in 1840.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1845, the institution, which at this point was male-only, officially changed its name to Granville College.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1853, William S. Denison, a Muskingum County farmer, pledged $10,000 toward the college's endowment.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Honoring an earlier commitment, the trustees accordingly changed the name of the institution to Denison University.
established$$$@@@%%%They also voted to move the college to land then available for purchase in the village of Granville.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the years leading up to the Civil War, many students and faculty members at Denison University became heavily involved in the anti-slavery movement.
established$$$@@@%%%Professor Asa Drury, the chair of Greek and Latin studies, became the leader of a local anti-slavery society, while Bancroft House, now a residential hall, served as a stop on the Underground Railroad.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Expansion</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The roots of coeducation at Denison University began in December 1832 with the establishment of the Granville Female Seminary, founded by <a>Charles Sawyer</a> a year before Oberlin launched the first coeducational college in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%The seminary was superseded by the Young Ladies' Institute, founded in 1859 by Dr. and Mrs. Nathan S. Burton.
established$$$@@@%%%The Young Ladies' Institute was sold to Reverend Dr. Daniel Shepardson in 1868 and was renamed the Shepardson College for Women in 1886.
established$$$@@@%%%Shepardson College was incorporated as part of Denison University in 1900, with the two colleges becoming fully consolidated in 1927.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1887, Denison inaugurated a master's program, with resident graduates pursuing advanced studies in the sciences.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Within a few years, the institution considered offering graduate programs on the doctoral level.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1926, the Board of Trustees formalized a new curriculum that would make Denison University an exclusively undergraduate institution.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the wake of Shepardson College's incorporation, Denison University made plans for enlargement of its campus.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1916, the college sought the expertise of the Frederick Law Olmsted &amp; Sons architectural firm, the founder of which had designed Central Park in New York City.
established$$$@@@%%%The resulting &quot;Olmstead Plan&quot; laid a foundation for expansion that has remained the guiding aesthetic for subsequent growth, establishing and maintaining a pedestrian-friendly campus, while also preserving scenic views of the surrounding hills and valleys.
established$$$@@@%%%Expansion during this period included the acquisiton of land to the north and east, the transfer of Shepardson College to the east ridge of College Hill, and the development of a new men's quadrangle beyond the library.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Recent History</h3>

vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Greek organizations are governed by an <a>Interfraternity Council</a> and <a>Panhellenic Council</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the mid-1990s, in an effort to re-brand the college as more of an academic, and less of a party, institution, the college's trustees and then-President Michele Tolela Myers elected to make Denison a &quot;non-residential&quot; Greek system.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The decision led to student and alumni uproar, with a low-grade riot erupting on the campus' &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; as a result.
established$$$@@@%%%The decision turned most of the formerly-residential fraternity houses into general college residential halls, and each chapter was given lounge space in the basement of each respective house for official fraternity functions (including chapter meetings).
