established$$$@@@%%%<strong>Bemidji State University</strong> (BSU) is a public state university in <a>Bemidji, Minnesota</a>, USA, located on the shores of <a>Lake Bemidji</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It is a part of <a>Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU)</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%BSU was founded in 1919 as Bemidji State Normal School.
established$$$@@@%%%The name was later changed to Bemidji State Teachers College, then shortened to Bemidji State College and finally Bemidji State University.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 1998-1999 academic year, the University Board of Regents recommended changing the name of the university to Minnesota State University - Bemidji, just as Moorhead State University and Mankato State University had changed their names to <a>Minnesota State University Moorhead</a> and <a>Minnesota State University, Mankato</a>, respectively.
established$$$@@@%%%The board argued this would emphasize the fact that BSU was a Minnesota university and thus attract more students from both in-state (who would otherwise be unaware that it was located in Minnesota) and out-of-state (who saw Minnesota as a good state in which to attend university).
established$$$@@@%%%Large vocal and written opposition from students, <a>alumni</a>, and local townspeople made the Board withdraw the recommendation.
students$$$@@@%%%Current enrollment is about 5,300 students, with students from 44 US states and 40 countries.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Each student attending BSU pays a 43 cent per credit fee to sustain the <a>Minnesota State University Student Association</a>, a student-led non-profit that advocates on behalf of all Minnesota State University Students.</p>
