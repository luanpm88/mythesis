image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Wilderness programs</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Earlham was one of the first colleges in the country to initiate student and faculty led wilderness programs, back in 1970 .
established$$$@@@%%%These programs were designed for incoming first-year and transfer students who received credit for them.
established$$$@@@%%%The program is divided into the Water August Wilderness and the Mountain August Wilderness and lasts for approximately three weeks; the former canoes in Wabakimi Provincial park in Ontario and the latter hikes in the Uinta Mountains in Utah.
staff$$$@@@%%%Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit.

image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>Student life</h2>
free$$$@@@%%%<p>Earlham's &quot;dry campus&quot; policy is controversial among members of the student body and some faculty members.
established$$$@@@%%%Drinking is fairly commonplace; some students refer to the campus as &quot;pleasantly moist.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In August 2007, as part of New Student Orientation for the incoming class of 2011, the Earlham faculty revealed their new approach to dealing with alcohol issues.
established$$$@@@%%%Although the official alcohol policy remains the same, the primary focus is now on education and personal responsibility, as opposed to enforcement.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Tension sometimes arises between students and the Quaker <a>Indiana</a> and Western Yearly Meetings over issues of sexuality.
established$$$@@@%%%Western and, to an even greater degree, Indiana Yearly Meeting tend to be more conservative on issues such as <a>condom</a> distribution, <a>pregnancy</a>, and <a>homosexuality</a>.
head_label$$$@@@%%%This tension has been a recurrent feature of Earlham life for decades.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2005, the Committee on Campus Life approved a new pregnancy policy, stating that pregnant women may reside in on-campus housing, but are also offered a housing exemption if they so desire.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Most students stay on-campus during the weekends.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Student Activities Board, Earlham Film Series, student bands, theater productions, etc. offer a variety of activities on the weekends.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In March 2005, <a>William Kristol</a>, founder and editor of <em><a>The Weekly Standard</a></em>, was hit in the face with an ice cream pie by a student during a lecture he gave on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%This event made <a>nation</a>al and <a>international</a> news and was carried by many leading news outlets.
established$$$@@@%%%Many students and faculty at the lecture showed strong disapproval of the act, and applauded when Kristol resumed his talk.
established$$$@@@%%%The event sharply divided students and, to a lesser extent, faculty, with some showing support for the act of pieing and most showing strong disapproval.
established$$$@@@%%%Many, however, felt that the act was unjustly punished by the President (who was also indirectly hit by the pie).
nickname$$$@@@%%%The student was subsequently suspended for the rest of the semester and dropped out the following year.
established$$$@@@%%%Additionally, President Doug Bennett overturned a College Judiciary Council ruling that found the students who knew about the pieing ahead of time not guilty; this act further divided the campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Shortly after the incident, conservative commentators <a>Pat Buchanan</a> and <a>David Horowitz</a> were 'attacked' (with salad dressing and a pie, respectively) and a 'teach-in' at Earlham was conducted which featured three faculty members sharing their views.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Several years <em>ex post facto</em>, the pieing, the punishment, and whether William Kristol should have even been invited to speak at Earlham all continue to be issues of contention amongst the faculty and student body.</p>
motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Hash</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Earlham has the only student-run <a>Hash House Harriers</a> running group, founded in 1989 and still continuing at present (2010).
established$$$@@@%%%While only loosely connected with national organizations, the student group maintains weekly runs and has been described by visitors as the &quot;Galapagos of Hashes&quot; for the creativity and development of hashing practices.
established$$$@@@%%%The Hash run takes place on the &quot;back campus,&quot; which may include the back property of the neighboring cemetery, during all seasons.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Campus Safety and Security office and Student Development office share concern about the event and do not condone its happening.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The Campus Safety and Security team has requested that the event be brought to an end via an article in the student-run newspaper, The Earlham Word.</p>
