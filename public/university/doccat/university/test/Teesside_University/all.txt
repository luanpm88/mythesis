established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Constantine Building</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While it was clear enough that, when the time came for a successor to the <a>Middlesbrough</a>-based <a>Mechanics' Institute</a> of 1844, a new technical college was in order, a shortage of funding long proved a barrier to any such plan.
established$$$@@@%%%The College's launch could otherwise have come as early as 1914.
established$$$@@@%%%Even after the donation of &#x00a3;40,000 to build the college from local shipping <a>magnate</a> Joseph Constantine in 1916, progress was slow.
established$$$@@@%%%A Governing Council took place in 1922, followed by a doubling of the original financial offer by the Constantine family in 1924.
established$$$@@@%%%For the task of constructing the first Technical College building, Mr Graham R. Dawbarn (a <a>London</a> architect also responsible for additions to <a>Corpus Christi College</a>, <a>Cambridge</a>) was appointed on 29 March 1926.
established$$$@@@%%%Building work finally kicked into action in 1927, culminating in the beginning of enrollment and teaching formalities on 16 September 1929.
established$$$@@@%%%But the fanfare had to wait, until the turn of the decade, in order to accommodate the royal schedule.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Constantine Technical College was nonetheless finally opened on 2 July 1930 by the future King Edward VIII, the <a>Prince of Wales</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Although not yet a <a>university</a>, from the outset, Constantine was both a <a>further</a> and <a>higher education</a> college.
established$$$@@@%%%While at one end of the spectrum students at Constantine could be as young as 15, also publicised in its Prospectus were <a>degree courses</a> validated by the <a>University of London</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%Star disciplines included <a>metallurgy</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>chemistry</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Five rooms were also reserved for an <a>art</a> department, until cramped accommodation forced the <a>School of Art</a> to split from its parent site for the 1950s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|University of Teesside on Borough Road.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The 1960s were years of sweeping change &#x2013; as well as political sting &#x2013; for the still comparatively fledgling College.
established$$$@@@%%%By the end of the decade the first two &quot;Teesside University&quot; campaigns had begun: the first, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second, from 1967 to 1972, spates of enthusiasm killed off on each occasion only by the scepticism of then-<a>Minister of Education</a>, <a>Anthony Crosland</a>, and <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>'s defining White Paper, respectively.
established$$$@@@%%%The latter effectively shelved plans for the erection of any new institution in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, until the 1980s at least.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On campus, one of the most visible major developments for the College was an extension comprising an 11-<a>storey</a> &quot;skyscraper&quot;, on which construction work began in 1963.
established$$$@@@%%%The College acquired the neighbouring former High School of 1877.
established$$$@@@%%%The College briefly restyled itself <em>Constantine College of Technology</em>, before becoming a <a>polytechnic</a> (<a>Britain</a>'s 13th) in 1969.
staff$$$@@@%%%At that point, the institution boasted 17 degree courses.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A merger with Teesside College of Education took place in the 1970s along with the purchase of Flatts Lane.
established$$$@@@%%%The Clarendon Building was added in 1973, as was the Stephenson Building in 1976, with both remaining in use for the Polytechnic's long-awaited conversion into a University.
established$$$@@@%%%That happened on 16 June 1992, when Teesside Polytechnic became one of the United Kingdom's first <a>new universities</a>, following that year's <a>Further and Higher Education Act</a>.</p>
affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Victoria Building</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the 1990s student numbers were nearing the 8,000 mark, but only in 1997 was the old Polytechnic's library replaced, by a Learning Resource Centre.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Subsequent additions included the Virtual Reality Centre and Centre for Enterprise, as well as, more recently, the Phoenix and Athena Buildings.
type$$$@@@%%%Today, historic structures such as the old High School (the Waterhouse building), the Constantine building and Victoria Building of 1891 (a schoolyard-equipped <a>Victorian</a> school, housing a series of graduate business incubator units), are all Grade II <a>listed building</a>s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2009, the University of Teesside changed its name to &quot;Teesside University&quot;, changed its logo and adopted the motto &quot;Inspiring success&quot; as part of a rebrand that cost &#x00a3;20,000.
established$$$@@@%%%Alternative names also suggested included &quot;Middlesbrough University&quot; and &quot;Tees Valley University&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 15 October 2009, Teesside University was elected <em>University of the Year</em> and <em>Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiative</em> in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> Awards.</p>
