campus$$$@@@%%%<h2>Founder and historical significance</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The inception of what is now known as the Scottish Church College is intertwined with the life of Dr. <a>Alexander Duff</a>, D. D. LLD.
established$$$@@@%%%(1806&#x2013;1878), the first overseas missionary of the <a>Church of Scotland</a>, to India.
established$$$@@@%%%Initially known as the <em>General Assembly's Institution</em>, it was founded on the 13th of July 1830.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Alexander Duff was born in Moulin, <a>Perthshire</a>, the very heart of <a>Scotland</a>, on 15 April 1806.
established$$$@@@%%%From the country school, he passed on to the <a>University of St Andrews</a>, where, after getting his degree, he ended a brilliant career.
established$$$@@@%%%Subsequently, he undertook his evangelical mission to India.
established$$$@@@%%%After an adventurous voyage during which he was twice shipwrecked, he arrived in Calcutta on 27 May 1830.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|left|100px|Reverend Dr. Alexander Duff, DD, LLD</a>  Rev. Alexander Duff opened his institution in Feringhi Kamal Bose's house, located in upper Chitpore Road, near <a>Jorasanko</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1836 the institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack's house at Garanhatta.
established$$$@@@%%%Mr. MacFarlon, the Chief-Magistrate of Calcutta, laid the foundation stone on 23 February 1837.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Mr. John Gray, elected by Messrs. Burn &amp; Co. and superintended by Captain John Thomson of the <a>Honourable East India Company</a> designed the building.
established$$$@@@%%%The construction of the building was completed in 1839.
established$$$@@@%%%In the early 1800s, the <a>General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</a> sent Reverend Alexander Duff, a young and dedicated missionary, to Kolkata to set up an English-<a>medium</a> institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Though <a>Bengal</a>is had shown some interest in the spread of Western education from the beginning of the 19th century, both the local church and government officers were skeptical about the high-caste Bengali's response to the idea of an English-medium institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Raja <a>Ram Mohan Roy</a> helped by organizing the venue and bringing in the first batch of students.
mascot$$$@@@%%%He also assured the guardians that reading the <a>Bible</a> did not necessarily imply religious conversion.
established$$$@@@%%%Although his ultimate aim was the spread of English education, Duff was aware that without a good command on one's native language, it was impossible to master a foreign language.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence in his General Assembly's Institution (as later in his Free Church Institution), the teaching and learning of the <a>Bengali language</a> and literature was given high priority.
established$$$@@@%%%Duff was keen on sports and had accumulated different kinds of sports-related equipment for use in his institution.
established$$$@@@%%%When he introduced <a>political economy</a> as a subject in the curricula, the Church strongly criticized him.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|left|Raja Ram Mohan Roy Bahadur, who supported Rev. Duff in spreading English education in India</a></p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1840, Duff returned to India.
established$$$@@@%%%At the <a>Disruption of 1843</a>, Duff sided with the Free Church.
established$$$@@@%%%He gave up the college buildings, with all their effects and with unabated courage, set to establish a new institution, which came to be known as the Free Church Institution.
established$$$@@@%%%He had the support of Sir <a>James Outram</a> and Sir <a>Henry Lawrence</a>, and the encouragement of seeing a new band of converts, including several young men born of high caste.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1844, governor-general <a>Viscount Hardinge</a> opened government appointments to all who had studied in institutions similar to Duff's institution.
established$$$@@@%%%In the same year, Duff co-founded the <em>Calcutta Review</em>, of which he served as editor from 1845 to 1849.
established$$$@@@%%%These two institutions founded by Duff, i.e., the General Assembly's Institution and the Free Church Institution would be merged later to form the Scottish Churches College.
established$$$@@@%%%After the unification of the <a>Church of Scotland</a> in 1929, the institution would be known as <a>Scottish Church College</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Along with Raja <a>Ram Mohan Roy</a>, the father of modern <a>India</a>, Dr. Duff played a significant role in supporting  <a>Lord Macaulay</a> in drafting his famous <em>Minute for the introduction of English education in India</em>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Successive eminent missionary scholars from Scotland, viz.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Dr. Ogilvie, Dr. Hastie, Dr. Macdonald, Dr. Stephen, Dr. Watt, Dr. Urquhart and others contributed to the spread of the <a>liberal</a> <a>Western</a> education.
established$$$@@@%%%Along with other educational institutions like <a>Serampore College</a>,   <a>Hindu College</a>, the Scottish Churches College played a pivotal role in ushering the spirit of intellectual enquiry and a general acceptance of the ideals of the European <a>Enlightenment</a>, among <a>Bengalis</a>, in what came to be regarded as the <a>Young Bengal Movement</a> and later, the <a>Bengal Renaissance</a>.</p>
free$$$@@@%%%<p>Duff's contemporaries included such luminaries as Reverend Mackay, Reverend Ewart and Reverend Thomas Smith.
established$$$@@@%%%Till the early 20th century the norm was to bring teachers from <a>Scotland</a> (like William Spence Urquhart, Leslie Stephen, H.M. Percival, Ian Fairweather etc.) but eminent Indian scholars were also engaged as teachers by the college authorities.
established$$$@@@%%%Scholars like <a>Surendranath Banerjea</a>, Kalicharan Bandyopadhyay, Jnan Chandra Ghosh, Gouri Shankar Dey, Adhar Chandra Mukhopadhyay Sushil Chandra Dutta, Mohimohan Basu, Sudhir Kumar Dasgupta, Nirmal Chandra Bhattacharya,  Bholanath Mukhopadhyay and Kalidas Nag had all contributed hugely to enhance the academic standards of the college.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%Duff played a leading part in founding the <a>University of Calcutta</a> in 1857, he was associated with the <em>Agro-horticultural Society</em> and the establishment of a medical college, the first in India.
established$$$@@@%%%He also aimed at breaking down <a>caste</a>-barriers by founding several girls schools.
established$$$@@@%%%The Scottish Church College played a pioneering role in women's education as well as co-education in the country.
established$$$@@@%%%Female students comprise half the present roll strength of the college.
established$$$@@@%%%With the added interest of the missionaries in educational work and social welfare, the college stands as a monument to Indo-<a>Scottish</a> co-operation.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The aims and principles of the College are essentially those of its founder namely, the formation of character through education based on Christian teaching.</p>
