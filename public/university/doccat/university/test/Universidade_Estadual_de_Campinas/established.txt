<h2>History</h2>
<p>Created in 1962 and physically installed in 1966, Unicamp's original goal was to promote <a>science education</a> in the <a>industrial</a> pole of S&#x00e3;o Paulo's interior region.
<p>Unicamp, which is responsible for around 15% of all Brazilian research, has courses, colleges and institutes of <a>Medicine</a>, <a>Nursing</a>, <a>Speech therapy</a>, <a>Pharmacy</a>, <a>Dentistry</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>Physical Education</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Mathematics</a> (Pure, Applied and Computational), <a>Statistics</a>, <a>Computer Sciences</a>, <a>Engineering</a> (<a>Control and Automation</a>, <a>Chemical</a>, <a>Food</a>, <a>Electrical</a>, <a>Computer</a>, <a>Mechanical</a>, <a>Agricultural</a> and <a>Civil</a>), <a>Architecture</a>, <a>Geography</a>, <a>Geology</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Arts</a>, <a>Music</a>, <a>Social Communication</a>, <a>Literature</a>, <a>Linguistics</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>History</a> and <a>Social Sciences</a>.
It also runs two professional vocational high schools, <a>COTUCA</a> (in Campinas) and <a>COTIL</a> (in Limeira).</p>
<p>Links to specific colleges and schools can be found <a>here</a> (in Portuguese).</p>
Beginning 1982, the University established a system of interdisciplinary groups, nuclei and centers.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Central Library building</a> The SBU (&quot;Sistema de Bibliotecas da UNICAMP&quot; or UNICAMP Library System) comprise of a central <a>library</a> and more than 20 other thematic libraries located in its colleges and institutes.
A number of historical libraries and historical and media archives, such as the <a>Arquivo Edgard Leuenroth</a>, have also been established.
The library system is fully automated and its collections may be freely accessed and searched on the Internet.
Its Digital Library section supports a database with more than 25,000 dissertations presented in the University, in full text, as well access to the largest electronic libraries of academic journals in the world.</p>
The only request to be filled is to have a complete <a>high school</a> course.
Vestibular comprises two stages: the first one is usually accomplished in November, with an essay and a 12-question discursive test on <a>Geography</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Biology</a> and <a>Chemistry</a>.
Those who get the minimum scores accomplish the second stage in January, taking tests with 12 questions of each subject, two subjects a day: <a>Portuguese</a> (including Brazilian and Portuguese Literature) and <a>Biology</a>; <a>Chemistry</a> and <a>History</a>; <a>Physics</a> and <a>Geography</a>; <a>Mathematics</a> and <a>English</a>.
Until 2005, the candidate had option to take a <a>French</a> test instead of <a>English</a>, but it is no longer an option.
Classes usually start in March.</p>
<p>For graduate programs, the university applies tests, interviews and analysis of curricula.
Some graduate programs also requires a specific exam on the area (such as <a>ANPEC (in Portuguese)</a>, for Economics, and <a>PosComp (in Portuguese)</a>, for Computing).</p>
Unicamp rectors have a <a>mandate</a> of 4 years, and are chosen by the state governor from a list of 3 candidates.
The candidate list is formed by the 3 most voted by the university community (staff, faculty and students), and the governor has always chosen the most voted candidate as rector.
<a>Zeferino Vaz</a>, who drove the installation and establishment of the university, was the first rector and held the position for 12 years.</p>
