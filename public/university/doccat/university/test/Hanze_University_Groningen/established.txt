<p> <strong>Hanze University Groningen</strong> (<strong><em>Hanzehogeschool Groningen</em></strong>) is an institution for tertiary education (<em><a>hogeschool</a></em>) located in <a>Groningen</a> in the northern <a>Netherlands</a>.
In international communication, the school calls itself Hanze University Groningen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hanze University was founded in 1986 as a merger of local institutes for professional education.
Since then, it has effectively subsumed almost all such institutes in the area of Groningen except for local branches of nation-wide institutes.
One of the most recent institutes subsumed is the Art Academy Minerva, which merged into Hanze University around 2000.
Because Minerva is a successor to a drawing academy founded 1798, Hanze University claims to exist since this year and celebrated its 210th anniversary in 2008.</p>
<p>The name 'Hanze' refers to the <a>Hanseatic League</a>, the medieval trade alliance of cities in the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia and the Baltic states.
Groningen is the second oldest university town in the Netherlands.
The Hanze offers programmes taught in English, Dutch and German.
Hanze University Groningen actively participates in projects aimed at supporting higher education institutions abroad with the enhancement of their curricula and strengthening the capacity of the institution.</p>
<p>Hanze University Groningen employs more than 2,000 personnel and has over 22,900 Dutch and foreign students  who have enrolled in one of the seventy degree programmes in the fields of economics, technology, health care, education and teacher training, social work, labour relations, fine arts, and music.
<p>The general management of Hanze University Groningen is in the hands of the Executive Board, supported by a Staff Office.
<p>Hanze University Groningen is for the major part housed on the so-called Zernike Campus, a campus area in the north of the city.
Here students will find the buildings of the Executive Board and its supporting Staff Office, and most of the schools.
