<p><strong>Dundalk Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>DkIT</strong>) formerly <strong>Regional Technical College, Dundalk</strong>  is a  campus situated in <a>Dundalk</a>, <a>County Louth</a>, <a>Ireland</a>, halfway between <a>Dublin</a> and <a>Belfast</a> (each approximately 80 kilometres away).
Dundalk is served by the Dublin Belfast Train corridor and Dundalk's Clarke Station is approximately a 20 minute walk (or 6 euro taxi ride) from the campus.
<p>In 2002 DkIT took possession of the adjoining Carrolls Tobacco Factory.
By 2005 partial development took place in the Carrolls site with Plumbing and Electrical Trades Workshops relocated there and the opening of a &quot;Bright Room&quot; digital media editing suite.
Refurbishment of 11,500 sq metres of the Carrolls Building was completed by 2010, and the <a>School of Informatics and Creative Arts</a>, consisting of the Departments of Computing &amp; Mathematics and Music &amp; Creative Media, took up full-time residence there.
The Building will be officially opened on the 31st January 2011.</p>
<p>In 2005 a building for the newly introduced Nursing and Health studies was opened.
In 2005 also, DkIT became one of the first urban locations to have an industrial standard wind turbine (850&nbsp;kW) installed.
It is the first large wind turbine in the world to be constructed on the campus of a third level institution.</p>
<p>The institution was one of the original network of <a>Regional Technical College</a>s set up in the 1970s with an emphasis on <a>business</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>science</a>.
In recent years the institution has expanded into hospitality and <a>nursing</a>.
<a>Apprenticeship</a> courses have long been a feature of the Institute, there has been continual expansion in the Apprenticeship provisioning the electrical and plumbing fields.
<p>Dundalk Institute of Technology has four Schools, and each School has several Departments with many courses on offer.
<p>The <a>Library</a> at DkIT Institute of Technology (DkIT) is located in the Dr T.K. Whitaker building.
<p>The Library building was named after Dr. <a>Whitaker</a> in recognition of his contribution to the Irish economy.
<p>The <a>Lifelong Learning Centre</a> at Dundalk Institute of Technology is a resource for the whole community of the Northeast, offering a range of opportunities for people to help with their career development or their personal growth and developing skills, or to help the need for learning for its own sake.
Their range of academic and other learning opportunities not only includes dozens of courses, which have proved their popularity over the years, but also introduces some new choices reflecting our requirement to adapt to the changing educational and training needs of a dynamic society.</p>
<p>With the recent economic climate, the Lifelong Learning Centre has had a huge increase in applications for night classes.</p>
<p>Established in 1989 by Dundalk Institute of Technology, the <a>Regional Development Centre</a> acts as the Institute&#x2019;s Innovation Support and Technology Transfer organisation.
The Centre acts as a commercially oriented interface between DKIT and the industrial, commercial and business life of the region, and makes available the expertise, facilities and resources of the Institute for the wider benefit of the regional economy.</p>
<p>Through the Research and Developmental endeavours of its Academic Staff, DKIT has developed a strong applied R&amp;D reputation in Software Development, Electronics and Engineering Design, Applied Humanities, Cultural Studies and Enterprise Development &amp; Innovation with a new and emerging area in the field of Renewable Energy and Digital Media.
The evolution of this range of Research expertise has a direct bearing on new course development, on staff development and on the relevance of graduate provision to the skills needs of the Regional and National economy.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times Higher Education analysis places the Institute as the top research income performer in the IoT sector and is a measure of the calibre of research activity being undertaken and the success of the Institute's Research Strategy over the last number of years.</p>
<p>These thematic areas include Ageing and Health, Informatics and the Environment, Creative Media, Music and Entrepreneurship, with the emerging area of nanoscience being explored as a potential growth area.
<p>The Institute has always recognised the need to sustain and develop this research base within its schools, of both the basic and applied nature, with a strong emphasis on research commercialisation and technology transfer.</p>
<p>The Institute's Language Scheme, the first of a series of three-year schemes under An Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&#x00fa;la (The Official Languages Act) 2003, came into effect on 18th October 2010.
The Institute has established Oifig na Gaeilge to aid in the implementation of the scheme and to coordinate a range of activities promoting the use of Irish within the Institute.
This office will open on a part-time basis at the start of 2011.</p>
<p>In October 2010 the Institute decided to &quot;reboot&quot; the Alumni Association ahead of the 40th Anniversary of the college (2011).
