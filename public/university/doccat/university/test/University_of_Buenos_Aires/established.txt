<p> The <strong>University of Buenos Aires</strong> (, UBA) is the largest <a>university</a> in <a>Argentina</a> and the second <a>largest university by enrollment</a> in Latin America, behind the <a>National Autonomous University</a> of Mexico.
Founded on August 12, 1821 in the city of <a>Buenos Aires</a>, it consists of 13 faculties, 6 hospitals, 10 museums and is linked to 4 high schools: <a>Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires</a>, <a>Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini</a>, <a>Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense&#x00f1;anza</a> and <em>Escuela de Educaci&#x00f3;n T&#x00e9;cnica Profesional en Producci&#x00f3;n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria</em>.</p>
<p>To enter any of the available programmes of study in the university, students who have successfully completed high school must pass a first year called CBC, which stands for <em>Ciclo B&#x00e1;sico Com&#x00fa;n</em> (Common Basic Cycle).
Only upon completion of this first year may the student enter the chosen school; until then, they must attend courses in different buildings, and have up to 3 years to finish the 6 subjects (which vary depending on the programme of study chosen) assigned in two groups of 3.
Potential students of economics, instead, take a 2-year common cycle, the &quot;CBG&quot; (General Basic Cycle), comprising 12 subjects.</p>
A centralized <em>Ciudad Universitaria</em> (literally, &quot;university city&quot;) was started in the 1960s, but contains only two schools, with the others at different locations in Buenos Aires.
<p>Access to the university is free of charge for everyone, including foreigners.
<p>It is currently the best ranked Argentine university in <a>college and university rankings</a>, present at number 197 of the Top Universities 2008 and at number 151-200 of the 2010 <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> <a>ranking</a>.
It has produced more <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates (four) than any other <a>Spanish-speaking</a> University.
In 2010, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance(URAP), University of Buenos Aires is the best university in Argentina and 247th university in the world.</p>
