established$$$@@@%%%<p>This summary is based on <em>From Maverick to Mainstream</em>, a review of Cumberland's history and the development of the American legal education system.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Langum and Walthall summarize the history of <strong>Cumberland Law School</strong> as:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>&quot;From its very local, Tennessee origins in 1847, Cumberland...emerged as a premier law school with a national status.
staff$$$@@@%%%It excelled in faculty, teaching methodology, and numbers of students.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the <a>American Civil War</a>, Cumberland rebuilt itself and ultimately succeeded on a grand scale with its single-year curriculum.&quot;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early years and founding</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cumberland School of Law was founded on July 29, 1847 in Lebanon, <a>Tennessee</a> at <a>Cumberland University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the end of 1847, there were 15 law schools in the country.
staff$$$@@@%%%Founder and first professor Judge Abraham Caruthers said, </p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>&quot;I call it an adventure, I speak of it as an experiment.&quot;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> Prior to the law school's official founding, <a>Cumberland University</a> facilitated the study of law and admitted a diverse student body, evidenced by graduates such as <a>George W. Harkins</a>, a <a>Choctaw</a> chief who received a law degree from Cumberland and became a judge in 1834.

faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Antebellum years</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to the founding of the United States' first law schools, the primary means for a legal education was <a>apprenticeship</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Establishing law schools was difficult in the early 19th century.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Harvard</a> was only able to reestablish its law school in 1829 and <a>Yale</a> in 1826.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1859 Cumberland, <a>Harvard</a>, and the <a>University of Virginia School of Law</a> were the three largest law schools in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%A year later, 1860, only 21 university law schools existed in the country and in no school did the curriculum extend beyond two years.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>During the Antebellum years Cumberland enjoyed success.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Nathan Green, Jr.</a>, son of then professor Nathan Green, Sr., stated that Cumberland enjoyed &quot;the highest degree of prosperity&quot;, with a beautiful  campus, picturesque trees and fences, and fine architecture.
type$$$@@@%%%Cumberland's first graduate <a>Paine Page Prim</a> ultimately became chief justice of the <a>Oregon Supreme Court</a>.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:Robert hatton statue.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Robert
established$$$@@@%%%H. Hatton]] (O) - US Congressman, Confederate brigadier general, killed during the <a>Battle of Fair Oaks</a>]] Students were taught through reading treatises, approximately two hours worth of recitations each morning, and a mandatory moot court program.
established$$$@@@%%%Caruthers considered the law a science and the <a>Socratic Method</a> a necessity.
established$$$@@@%%%After the Civil War, this treatise method, the legal formalism of the school's approach, and Nathan Green Jr.'s unwillingness to make changes, were all considered reasons for Cumberland's drift out of the mainstream.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Civil war</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>April 13, 1861 jolted Cumberland out of its &quot;Golden Age&quot; when President <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> called for volunteers to quell the southern insurrection.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The campus split within a week; some students joined the northern army; many joined the southern.
established$$$@@@%%%Nathan Green Jr.'s father, a law professor, went home, but in fear of arrest, Abraham Caruthers fled to <a>Marietta, Georgia</a>, where he died a year later.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Reconstruction</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The law school began the slow process of rebuilding.
established$$$@@@%%%In July 1866, Cumberland adopted the image of the <a>phoenix</a>, the mythological Egyptian bird that is reborn from its own ashes.
established$$$@@@%%%The new motto was &quot;<a>E Cineribus Resurgo</a>&quot; or &quot;I rise from the ashes.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In September 1865 classes resumed with 11 students, which soon grew to 20.
established$$$@@@%%%The 1865 class included a Confederate General and Union colonel, enemies only a few months earlier.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Nathan Green, Jr. kept the school together until Henry Cooper, a circuit judge, Andrew B. Martin, and <a>Robert L. Caruthers</a>, brother of deceased founder Abraham Caruthers, joined the faculty.
established$$$@@@%%%Robert Caruthers had previously served as the state attorney general and had been elected Governor of Tennessee during the war in 1863, but was never innaugurated.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Cooper did not serve on the faculty for long.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|250px|left|Cumberland School of Law - Corona Hall - Law School from 1873-1878</a>In 1873 Robert Caruthers purchased Corona Hall from the <a>Corona Institute for Women</a> for $10,000, which he immediately donated to the University for use by the law school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The destruction of the campus and the devastation of war had impoverished the school and it was almost 15 years before it saw students enter from outside the South, when a student from Illinois and a member of the <a>Choctaw Nation</a> enrolled at Cumberland.
established$$$@@@%%%But there were few students from outside of the defeated Southern states, which Langum and Walthall claim underscored &quot;how terribly the Civil War blighted Cumberland.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Robert Caruthers persisted, despite the setbacks, and in 1878 Caruthers Hall was dedicated in his honor.
former_names$$$@@@%%%This new school replaced Corona Hall, which had limitations.
established$$$@@@%%%The new hall apparently had &quot;excellent acoustics and hard seats&quot; and is described as a: </p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>&quot;splendid structure, built after the latest architectural style, is nearly one hundred feet from base to spire, and contains two recitation rooms for the Law Department, two Society Halls, a Library, and a chapel whose seating capacity is about seven hundred.</p>

country$$$@@@%%%<h3>National shift in legal education</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Caruthers Hall, from the <em>Phoenix</em> in 1903.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Despite the seemingly heroic efforts to keep the school alive, Cumberland was falling into the minority at the turn of the 20th century.
established$$$@@@%%%It maintained a one-year curriculum when other schools moved toward longer terms, and it was entrenched with <a>legal formalism</a>, which had reached its peak in the 1870s and would soon be on the decline.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1876, for instance, <a>Harvard Law School</a> began to encourage a three-year curriculum.
established$$$@@@%%%Through 1919, Cumberland did not adapt to the shift in legal education.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1903 Nathan Green, Jr. became the first dean of the law school.
established$$$@@@%%%For the prior 57 years the school did not have this position, which was becoming more and more popular among law schools.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cumberland first admitted women in 1901, Today, the Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library contains 300,000 volumes and microform volume equivalents.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1915 Cumberland refurbished its halls with an $8000 grant from the U.S. government as reparation for federal occupancy during the Civil War.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When <a>Cordell Hull</a> graduated from Cumberland, he commented on the diploma privilege, which granted the right to practice law without taking a <a>bar exam</a>, saying that:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>according to custom, we members of the graduating class, the moment we received our diplomas, took them to the courthouse, where a district judge awaited us.
established$$$@@@%%%He swore us in as members of the bar.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%I was not 20 years old.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> Cordell Hull is today honored at Cumberland with a <a>Moot Court</a> room bearing his name.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cumberland eventually did adapt to the changing times, moving from <a>Cumberland University</a> in <a>Lebanon, Tennessee</a>, to <a>Samford University</a> in <a>Birmingham, Alabama</a> in 1961.
established$$$@@@%%%It is only one of two law schools in the United States to have been sold from one university to another (the other being the sale of the law school from the <a>University of Puget Sound</a> to <a>Seattle University</a>).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Today the law school is known for its emphasis on trial advocacy and is building a biotechnology emphasis through its <a>Biotechnology Center</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Long range plan of 2005</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|325px|thumb|<em>Memory Leake Robinson Hall</em> in 2006</a> In December 2005 Cumberland adopted a long-term plan for the school.
established$$$@@@%%%One call of the plan is to gradually downsize the number of students in order to provide smaller classes and closer individual attention to students.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1995 the entering class was 212 and by 2007 that number had been reduced to 159.</p>
