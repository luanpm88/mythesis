<p>The <strong>School of General Studies</strong>, commonly known as <strong>General Studies</strong> or simply <strong>GS</strong>, is <a>Columbia University</a>'s undergraduate college for <a>non-traditional students</a>.</p>
In the 2006 class, the average age was 27 for incoming students, and the majority attend full-time.</p>
<p>GS awards both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.
A Columbia undergraduate class could include students from any of the following schools: GS, Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Barnard College.
<a>thumbnail|left|200px|General Studies Student Council's Owl Logo as sketched in 2007</a> While Columbia University&#x2019;s mascot is a lion, the School of General Studies has its own mascot: the owl, which was selected for two reasons.
First, it represents a connection to night classes, which most GS students attended in the School's early days.
Second, the owl represents Athena and thus knowledge and wisdom; an owl can be found hiding in the robes of the university's central <a><em>Alma Mater</em> statue</a>.
The school also has a separate motto - &quot;<em>Lux In Tenebris Lucet,</em>&quot; Latin for: <em>The light that shines in the darkness</em>.</p>
The fully orchestrated recording premiered in May 2006, during class day.
It is hoped that &quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot;  will be given equal consideration and representation as the song Sans Souci during class day exercises.
&quot;Columbia, Columbia&quot; is the only Alma Mata composed by two students matriculating at a school during the time of its creation.
<p>The school&#x2019;s name refers to its diverse student body by alluding to medieval universities, which were also known as <em><a>studia generalia</a></em>.
Unlike the <em>studia partiuclaria</em>, schools that educated only members of a local population, the <em>studia generalia</em> were degree-granting institutions that served a much broader, often international group of students and scholars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
GS [[coat of arms]], as first sketched in 1950]]  Nontraditional education began at Columbia in the 1830s.
A formal program, Extension Teaching (later renamed University Extension), was created by Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1904.
In the 2009-2010 school year, the school hosts 88 of Columbia's 210 studying veterans.</p>
<p>Formerly housed in the Alumni House, now known as Buell Hall, the School of General Studies moved to its current location, Lewisohn Hall, in 1964.
<p>:GS students attend the same classes as students in other colleges at the university.
The separate <a>Columbia School of Continuing Education</a> offers individual courses on a non-degree basis.
The College of Liberal and Professional Studies at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> also serves nontraditional students and offers heavily discounted night classes taught by a faculty that includes tenured professors, adjunct professors, and advanced graduate students (though LPS students also have the option to take day classes).)</p>
<li>GS is a back door to CC.</li>
<p>Undergraduates enrolled in the School of General Studies, including Joint Program students, who are interested in transferring to another Columbia or affiliated undergraduate school (Columbia College, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Barnard College, or List College/JTS) should not submit a transfer application to any of those schools without prior consultation with their GS advisors.
<p>Transfer applications from GS to Columbia College, SEAS, or the Joint Program with JTS will not be considered by those schools without a written endorsement from the GS Dean of Students.
