<p>The <strong>University of Coimbra (UC)</strong> (, ) is a Portuguese <a>public university</a> in <a>Coimbra</a>, <a>Portugal</a>.
It is one of the <a>oldest universities in continuous operation</a> in Europe and the world, the oldest <a>university</a> of Portugal, and one of its largest <a>higher education</a> and <a>research</a> institutions.
It is organized into eight different <a>faculties</a> according to a wide range of fields, granting all the highest academic degrees in architecture, education, engineering, humanities, law, mathematics, medicine, natural sciences, psychology, social sciences and sports.
It is a founding member of the <a>Coimbra Group</a>, a group of leading European research universities, whose inaugural meeting it hosted.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded, or ratified, in 1290 by <a>King Dinis</a>, having begun its existence in <a>Lisbon</a> with the name <a>Studium Generale</a> (<em>Estudo Geral</em>).
<em>Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis</em>, the royal charter announcing the institution of the University was dated 1 March of that year, although efforts had been made at least since 1288 to create this first University in <a>Portugal</a>; it is thus one the oldest of such establishments in the <a>Iberian Peninsula</a>.
The Papal confirmation was also given in 1290 (on 9 August of that year), during the Papacy of the <a>Pope Nicholas IV</a>.
In accordance with the Papal Bull, all the &quot;licit&quot; Faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established.
Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law and Medicine were the first to be created.

It was, however, not to remain in Lisbon for long.
In 1308, likely due to problems of emancipation from the Church (relations between the latter and the political power being somewhat strained at the time) and conflicts between the inhabitants of the city and the students, the University moved to <a>Coimbra</a>.
This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the <a>Monastery of Santa Cruz</a>.
<p>In 1338, during the reign of <a>Afonso IV</a>, it was once again transferred to Lisbon, from whence it returned in 1354, this time to the centre of the town which was then in full expansion.
In 1377, during the reign of <a>King Fernando</a>, it was transferred yet again to Lisbon, where it would remain for over a century and a half.
The authorization for a Faculty of Theology probably dates from this period &#x2013; around 1380. [[Image:DinisI-UniCoimbra.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]] statue with the Medicine Faculty in the background.]]
In 1537, during the reign of <a>Jo&#x00e3;o III</a>, the university moved definitively to Coimbra, where it was installed in the Alca&#x00e7;ova Palace.
The entire university institution, including the teaching staff and all the books from its library, were moved from Lisbon to Coimbra.
At the same time, university colleges were created (<a>abolished in the 19th century</a>), a restructuring of the curricula was undertaken and new teachers, both Portuguese and foreign, were admitted.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the <a>Marquis of Pombal</a>, Minister of the kingdom, made radical reforms in the University, especially regarding the teaching of sciences, in accordance to his <a>Enlightenment</a> and anticlerical creed.</p>
<p>During many decades it was the only <a>university</a> in Portugal, since its foundation in 1290 until 1559 (a university in <a>&#x00c9;vora</a> operated between 1559 and 1759), and again between 1759 and 1911 (<a>University of Lisbon</a> and <a>University of Porto</a> were created in 1911).
The long history and past predominance of the University of Coimbra made it an important focus of influence in Portugal, not only educational, but also political and social.</p>
<p>Initial steps towards some convergence of European higher education systems were taken with the signature of the <a>Sorbonne declaration</a> by the Ministers in charge of higher education in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, in 1998, and later, in 1999, with the signature of the <a>Bologna declaration</a>.
The <a>Bologna process</a>, aimed at creating a <a>European Higher Education Area</a> by implementing a comparable degree structure, common quality assurance standards and by promoting the mobility of students and faculty members, was a major revolution in Europe's higher education.
<a>Globalization</a>, technological change and increased international competition for scarce high-skilled labor highlighted the importance of making European higher education institutions attractive and competitive worldwide.
In Portugal, the University of Coimbra decided to defer the adoption of the new <a>Bologna Process</a> model from 2006 to 2007/2008 (with exceptions authorized for a few programs on which a national consensus for change had been reached among institutions) in order to make the transition maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity.
Only in the 2008/2009 school year did the entire university fully adopt the new programs within its 8 <a>faculties</a>.</p>

The University's governance is assured by the <a>Rector</a>, Senate and University Assembly, the latter responsible for the election of the Rector and members of Senate.
The Rector has the main responsibility for the strategic direction and overall administration of the University together with the Senate and assisted by the Administrative Council.</p>
The Faculty of Sciences and Technology (FCTUC) is the largest by number of professors and students, awards the highest number of academic degrees, and manages more classrooms and research units than any other in the UC.
Both the <a>Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal</a>, an organization under direct supervision of the Portuguese Ministry of the Justice, which provides <a>forensic science</a> services to the police forces and government agencies of Portugal, and the University of Coimbra's <a>teaching hospital</a>, HUC (<em><a>Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra</a></em>), a <a>university hospital</a> known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties, are managed by the Faculty of Medicine (FMUC).</p>
In addition, the university manages several <a>museums</a> and other cultural organizations, including a <a>science</a> museum (<a>Science Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>), a museum of <a>sacred art</a> (<a>Sacred Art Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>), and an academic museum (<a>Academic Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>).</p>

Formed on 3 November 1887, it is the oldest university students' union in Portugal, with a long history of struggle against unpopular state policies, forming notable politicians and intellectuals along the way.
It also harbours a very dynamic associative life, with its numerous  sports and cultural sections, as well as a number of other autonomous organizations.
It is an important structure of extracurricular formation of the University of Coimbra's students and a major institution of the city itself.
The old &quot;Republics&quot; (autonomous students' residences) remain, as well as some traditional festivities, most notably the &quot;<a>Queima das Fitas</a>&quot; (a celebration of graduation's end, symbolized by the burning of the ribbons with the colors of each of the eight faculties), the &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; (a <a>homecoming</a>), the frequent use of traditional attire, the &quot;<a>Fado de Coimbra</a>&quot; (Coimbra's <a>fado</a>, now sung in organized shows rather than the traditional street serenades), and the academic ceremonies (namely the conferring of doctorate degrees).

The color of the university seal and of the Rector's office, representing the entire institution as a whole, is dark green.
The flag of the University of Coimbra (white flag with the dark green seal in the middle) is always erected, over the top of the old university tower, on the 1st of March, which is the day of the university, being an occasion for a week of debates, conferences, workshops, and special events related with multiple aspects of the institution.

The <strong><a>Praxe</a></strong> is a body of ritual and custom founded upon ancient traditions and it is an important part of Coimbra's academic life which no university student is indifferent to.
Part of the attraction of Coimbra's academic life, aside from its recognized excellence is that it is more <em>Praxe</em>, having unique rituals that set it apart from other institutions and give its students a special sense of participation in academic rituals originating hundreds of years ago.
Though these rituals are seen as outdated by some, it remains an important reference in the academic experience of the University of Coimbra's students.
The rules of the <em>Praxe</em> are contained in a book (The Code of Academic Praxe, by a committee of older students of the AAC &#x2013; <a>Associa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o Acad&#x00e9;mica de Coimbra</a>), which defines appropriate student behavior for activities like drafting, evaluation, groups or bands and the Burning of the Ribbons rituals.
The Freshman (1st yr.) period (naturally, the lowest category in the <em>Praxe</em> hierarchy) is for most students a time of good and lasting memories of never to be repeated events.
All of academic life in Coimbra is filled with tradition and ritual and tends to be quite memorable.
One of the most visible and distinctive traditions is the use of the academic costume of the University of Coimbra, a black suit and cape used on special occasions by the students and which was adopted by other Portuguese universities and is actually used by students of almost all higher education institutions in the city and across the country.</p>
<p>Praxis almost disappeared in the years after the <a>25 de Abril revolution</a> of 1974.
Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s.
In the days of old it was common usage, that the student would wear for the whole length of his studies.
Many students slept in it, wine undermining their efforts to reach home.
The cape would get to the end of studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend.
It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of the ages.</p>
<p>A student that enrolled more than the years of his course was a veteran.
Through the ages, when University enrollment was a matter of class, some students would accumulate quite a number of enrollments.
The individual that had the most, was Dux Veteranorum, a notable figure in the students scene at the University.
It is a relatively important team, especially as regards to its huge number of followers nationwide, and plays in the top Potuguese football leagues, having been the first winner in history of the <a>Portuguese Football Cup</a>, in 1939.</p>
It includes numerous events and traditions born in the 19th century in the University of Coimbra.
It is defined as a welcome to the new students, the <a>freshmen</a> (<em>caloiros</em>), and takes place at the beginning of the academic year in Portuguese university towns.
<h4>History</h4>
<p>&quot;The Freshman's Reception&quot; (<em>Recep&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o ao Caloiro</em>, the Portuguese name for university homecoming) goes back to the 19th century when the law students of the University of Coimbra felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely <a>tin can</a>s, which is the original root of &quot;The Tin Can Parade&quot;.
One of the most powerful <a>supercomputer</a>s in Portugal belongs to the University of Coimbra and is managed by the Laboratory for Advanced Computing of the Department of Physics at the University of Coimbra.
Built in the mid 2000s, the supercomputer was called <em>Milipeia</em>, using 528 processors and 1000 GB of memory.
The main tasks of the university's supercomputer include modeling and calculus in <a>molecular biology</a>, <a>genetics</a>, <a>particle physics</a>, <a>astrophysics</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>geophysics</a>, <a>condensed matter physics</a>, etc.
<p>School year calendar starts in October and finishes in July.
The time limit is 6 years from the date of first enrolment for the 4 years degrees, and 8 years from the date of first enrolment for 6 years degrees (i.e.
It was increased to 880&#x20ac;/year in 2004/2005 and to 901,23&#x20ac;/year in 2005/2006, the maximum fee allowed to state universities by law.
Even with the time limit and the increased tuition fees, the university has had a high number of applicants every year.
Overcrowded classrooms have been frequent in some disciplines at the Faculties of Science and Technology, Law, and Economics.
To such study programmes like those of medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200).
<p> Many historical figures and renowned personalities noted for their activity in fields ranging from politics to culture to the sciences, attended the University of Coimbra as students or lecturers.
The long list of personalities includes the only Portuguese <a>Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> <a>Egas Moniz</a>, Portuguese statesman <a>Ant&#x00f3;nio de Oliveira Salazar</a> who was the founder and leader of the regime that presided over the last period of the <a>Portuguese Empire</a> from 1933 to 1974, or famous 16th century mathematicians like <a>Pedro Nunes</a>, who is considered one of the greatest Portuguese mathematicians ever, and the German <a>Christopher Clavius</a>, who was the main architect of the modern <a>Gregorian calendar</a>.</p>
