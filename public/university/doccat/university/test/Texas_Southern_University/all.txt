affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Texas Southern University</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Texas Southern</strong> or <strong>TSU</strong>) is a <a>historically black university</a> located in <a>Houston</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%TSU began in 1927 when it started as Houston Colored Junior College, through its private college phase as Houston Colored College.
established$$$@@@%%%On March 3, 1947 the state declared this to be the first state university in Houston, Texas State University for Negroes.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In 1951 the name changed to Texas Southern University.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Texas Southern is one of only four independent public universities in Texas (those not affiliated with any of Texas' six public university systems) and is one of the largest and most comprehensive HBCUs in the nation.</p>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>As of October 2009, about 85% of TSU's students were <a>African-American</a>. 54% of law school students and 43% of pharmacy students were African-American.
established$$$@@@%%%During that year, the university's president, John Rudley, said that he would try to court <a>Hispanic American</a>s as students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The beginnings of Texas Southern University can be traced to the March 7, 1927 resolution by the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> school board to establish junior colleges for each race.
established$$$@@@%%%The resolution created Houston Junior College (now the <a>University of Houston</a>) and Houston Colored Junior College.
established$$$@@@%%%The Houston Colored Junior College first held classes in <a>Yates High School</a> during the evenings.
established$$$@@@%%%It later changed its name to Houston College for Negores.
established$$$@@@%%%In February 1946, <a>Heman Marion Sweatt</a>, an <a>African American</a> man, applied to the <a>University of Texas School of Law</a>.
campus$$$@@@%%%He was denied admission because of race, and subsequently filed suit.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%(See <em><a>Sweatt v. Painter</a></em> (1950).)
established$$$@@@%%%The state had no law school for African Americans.
established$$$@@@%%%Instead of granting Sweatt a <em><a>writ of mandamus</a></em>, the Texas trial court continued the case for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As a result, the state founded Texas Southern University under <a>Senate Bill 140</a> by the <a>Fiftieth Texas Legislature</a> on March 3, 1947 as a <a>state university</a> to be located in Houston.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally named Texas State University for Negroes, the school was established to serve <a>African Americans</a> in Texas and offer them fields of study comparable to those available to white Texans.
established$$$@@@%%%The state took over the Houston Independent School District (HISD)-run Houston College for Negroes as a basis for the new university.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time, Houston College just moved to the present site (adjacent to the University of Houston) donated by <a>Hugh Roy Cullen</a> and had one permanent building and an existing faculty and students.
staff$$$@@@%%%The new university was charged with teaching &quot;pharmacy, dentistry, arts and sciences, journalism education, literature, law, medicine and other professional courses.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The legislature stipulated that &quot;these courses shall be equivalent to those offered at other institutions of this type supported by the State of Texas.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Given the differences in facilities and intangibles such as the distance of the new school from Austin and other law students, the Supreme Court ruled it did not satisfy &quot;separate but equal&quot; provisions, and that African Americans must also be admitted to the University of Texas Law School at Austin.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 1990s, of all Texas universities, TSU had the most incidents of violent crime on its campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Crime became an issue in the campus during the 14 years leading to 2005.</p>
