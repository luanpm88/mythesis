TSU began in 1927 when it started as Houston Colored Junior College, through its private college phase as Houston Colored College.
On March 3, 1947 the state declared this to be the first state university in Houston, Texas State University for Negroes.
During that year, the university's president, John Rudley, said that he would try to court <a>Hispanic American</a>s as students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The beginnings of Texas Southern University can be traced to the March 7, 1927 resolution by the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> school board to establish junior colleges for each race.
The resolution created Houston Junior College (now the <a>University of Houston</a>) and Houston Colored Junior College.
The Houston Colored Junior College first held classes in <a>Yates High School</a> during the evenings.
It later changed its name to Houston College for Negores.
In February 1946, <a>Heman Marion Sweatt</a>, an <a>African American</a> man, applied to the <a>University of Texas School of Law</a>.
The state had no law school for African Americans.
Instead of granting Sweatt a <em><a>writ of mandamus</a></em>, the Texas trial court continued the case for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks.
<p>As a result, the state founded Texas Southern University under <a>Senate Bill 140</a> by the <a>Fiftieth Texas Legislature</a> on March 3, 1947 as a <a>state university</a> to be located in Houston.
Originally named Texas State University for Negroes, the school was established to serve <a>African Americans</a> in Texas and offer them fields of study comparable to those available to white Texans.
The state took over the Houston Independent School District (HISD)-run Houston College for Negroes as a basis for the new university.
At the time, Houston College just moved to the present site (adjacent to the University of Houston) donated by <a>Hugh Roy Cullen</a> and had one permanent building and an existing faculty and students.
The legislature stipulated that &quot;these courses shall be equivalent to those offered at other institutions of this type supported by the State of Texas.&quot;</p>
<p>Given the differences in facilities and intangibles such as the distance of the new school from Austin and other law students, the Supreme Court ruled it did not satisfy &quot;separate but equal&quot; provisions, and that African Americans must also be admitted to the University of Texas Law School at Austin.</p>
Crime became an issue in the campus during the 14 years leading to 2005.</p>
<p>Under the new president of TSU <a>Dr.John M. Rudley</a>, the university has devised a cohesive plan to overcome many of the obstacles that set the school back from the prior administrations.
With this innovative initiative, graduation and retention rate has increased as well as the level of academia at the school.
Through President Rudley and the guidance of Provost <a>Dr.
Sunny E. Ohia</a>, who is the also the V.P. of Academic Affairs and Research, the school has embarked on securing more fellowships grants and government funded research than it has ever encountered prior to this administration.</p>
The honors college recognize top students and provide  prgramming, curriculum and opportunities to push the boundaries of their intellectual curiosity.</p>
Rudley has also established a more redefined Urban Academic Village focused and aimed at retaining freshman and sophomore student by  encouraging more focus and emphasis on study habits and providing an environment conducive to this goal through upperclass mentors, library access, computer lab  access, tutorials and one on one interaction with faculty outside of the classroom.
<p>A generous gift from TSU Alumn <a>Kase Lawal</a> of $1 million has allowed for the university to establish the Kase Lawal Center for Global Trade in its Jesse H. Jones School of Business, providing scholarships for students in international business and programming to support both the academic and business communities.
Lawal, a native of Nigeria, earned his B.A. in chemistry from TSU and is chairman and chief executive officer of CAMAC International Corporation.
<p>Along with a joint effort with radio personality <a>Tom Joyner</a> and his <a>Tom Joyner Foundation</a> Tsu will be named as the Tom Joyner foundations HBCU of the Month for the month of September 2010.
<p>The <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> placed TSU on probation for noncompliance with regulations on financial management and administration.
However, the university's probation was lifted in June 2010.</p>
