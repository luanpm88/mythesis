<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding of the University</h3>
<p>The National Chi Nan University Planning Committee was established on 1 March 1991 in order to  establish a university with the following missions:</p>
<li>To provide more <a>higher education</a> opportunities.</li>
<li>To improve the education of <a>Overseas Chinese</a>.</li>
<li>To assist in developing industries as a part of <a>Six-Year National Construction Plan</a> of the <a>Republic of China</a>.</li>
<li>To balance cultural and educational development between regions.</li>
<p>Land which previously was the property of the <a>Taiwan Sugar Corporation</a> was selected as the campus of the new university in January 1992.
The initial phase of construction of the university was completed in July 1995.
The first classes of <a>graduate student</a>s were enrolled at the University in September 1995.
The first classes of undergraduates registered in September 1996, along with the official opening of the campus.</p>
<p>When the devastating <a>921 earthquake</a> struck <a>Nantou County</a> on 21 September 1999, all major buildings and dormitories in campus were critically damaged, and the University suffered a great loss of equipment and basic infrastructure.
The restoration of the campus was mostly completed in the following six months.

<p>The name <strong><em>Chi Nan</em></strong> ([from north] to south) comes from <a>Chapter of Tribune of Yu</a> of <a>Classic of History</a>, where a passage reads: &quot;His speech and teachings spread from north to south, until they reached the four corners of the world.&quot;
More than a century ago, <em>Chi Nan</em> was first used as the title of an academic organization&#x2014;<a>Chi Nan Academy</a>, established in 1906 near the end of the <a>Qing Dynasty</a> and dedicated to educating talented Chinese youths born or raised abroad.
The founders of the Academy relished this ancient Chinese quotes and named the Academy accordingly to manifest its mission.
After the founding of the <a>Republic of China</a> in 1912, Chi Nan Academy was reorganized into <a>Chi Nan University</a> in <a>Guangzhou</a>.
