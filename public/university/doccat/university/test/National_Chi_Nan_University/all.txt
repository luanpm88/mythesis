free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Origin of the name</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|320px|right|The gate of National Chi Nan University</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The name <strong><em>Chi Nan</em></strong> ([from north] to south) comes from <a>Chapter of Tribune of Yu</a> of <a>Classic of History</a>, where a passage reads: &quot;His speech and teachings spread from north to south, until they reached the four corners of the world.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%More than a century ago, <em>Chi Nan</em> was first used as the title of an academic organization&#x2014;<a>Chi Nan Academy</a>, established in 1906 near the end of the <a>Qing Dynasty</a> and dedicated to educating talented Chinese youths born or raised abroad.
established$$$@@@%%%The founders of the Academy relished this ancient Chinese quotes and named the Academy accordingly to manifest its mission.
established$$$@@@%%%After the founding of the <a>Republic of China</a> in 1912, Chi Nan Academy was reorganized into <a>Chi Nan University</a> in <a>Guangzhou</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%These two organizations are directly related to National Chi Nan University in Puli, Nantou County, and traditionally, the name <em>Chi Nan</em> conveys the University's mission of education beyond China.</p>
