<p><strong>Bishop College</strong> was a <a>historically black college</a>, founded in <a>Marshall, Texas</a>, and later moved to <a>Dallas, Texas</a>, that operated from 1881 to 1988.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was founded by the Baptist <a>Home Mission Society</a> in 1881 as the result of a movement to build a college for <a>African-American</a> <a>Baptists</a>.
The movement was started by <a>Nathan Bishop</a>, who had been the <a>superintendent</a> of several major <a>school system</a>s in <a>New England</a>.
<a>Baylor University</a> President Rufus C. Burleson secured a pledge of $25,000 from Judge Bishop during a meeting of the National Baptist Education Society meeting in Philadelphia, PA to start the college.
A committee of Baptist ministers from <a>East Texas</a> selected a location in Marshall, on land belonging to the Holcomb <a>Plantation</a>, <em>Wylucing</em>.
<p>For its first several decades, Bishop's faculty and administration largely consisted of <a>white people</a>.
The first <a>African-American</a> to be president was Joseph J. Rhoads, who assumed the leadership role in 1929 and remained through the <a>Great Depression</a> and <a>World War II</a>.
During his presidency, Bishop phased out its <a>high school</a> programs and placed emphasis on its new two-year ministerial program.
During the 1930s and 1940s the ministerial program evolved into the Lacy Kirk Williams Institute, which attracted national attention; its attendants included the Rev. <a>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and Rev. <a>Jesse Jackson</a>.
<p>In 1961, after receiving a grant from the <a>Hoblitzelle Foundation</a>, Bishop moved to a  campus in Dallas.
<p>In 2006, the president of <a>Georgetown College</a> in <a>Georgetown, Kentucky</a> proposed a plan to Bishop College alumni to make Georgetown their adopted <em><a>alma mater</a></em>.
Upon graduation, these students receive diplomas with the name and insignia of Bishop College.
