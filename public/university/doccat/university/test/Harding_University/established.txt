The university takes its name from <a>James A. Harding</a>.</p>
<p>The school was founded in 1924 as Harding College in <a>Morrilton, Arkansas</a> and moved a decade later to the campus of the defunct Galloway Women's College in Searcy.
Today, the University contains forty-four buildings, a <a>graduate school of religion</a> in <a>Memphis</a>, satellite campuses in <a>North Little Rock</a> and <a>Bentonville</a>, and International campuses in Brisbane, Australia; Vina del Mar, Chile; London, England; Porto Rafti, Greece; Florence, Italy; France; and Zambia, Africa.
<p>Harding University also operates Camp Tahkodah in Floral, Arkansas, <a>Harding Academy</a> in Searcy, and the <a>Harding University Graduate School of Religion</a> in <a>Memphis</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>.</p>

<p>The Harding American Studies Institute is designed to supplement students' academic training and promote &quot;a complete understanding of the institutions, values, and ideas of liberty and democracy.&quot;[<a>http://www.harding.edu/asi/info.html</a>]
In doing so, the ASI exhibits a generally conservative political stance, focused on going &quot;back to the fundamental values that made this country great.&quot;
The formal roots of this program date back to 1953, when Harding formed the School of American Studies.
<p>Prior to the formal foundation of the ASI, Harding was also involved in the production of a series of animated cartoons extolling the virtues of free-market capitalism.
This series, including 1948's  &quot;Make Mine Freedom&quot; (which, ironically, portrays activities not permitted by Harding's code of conduct at the time) and &quot;Going Places&quot;, as well as 1951's  &quot;Meet King Joe&quot;, were all produced by John Southerland Productions as part of a concerted propaganda program to fight against the perceived threats of <a>communism</a> at the beginning of the <a>Cold War</a> using popular media.
The animations portray mainstream American values, some of which might now be considered politically &quot;liberal,&quot; yet at the time, they were meant to contrast with the values of Soviet and Maoist <a>socialism</a>.
The initiative represented a central concern of Harding president George S. Benson, who believed that fighting socialism was a moral imperative, causing him to abandon the pacifism and political disengagement championed by founding influences <a>James A. Harding</a> and <a>David Lipscomb</a>, reversing the university's course and setting it on its current conservative political trajectory.</p>
<p>Currently, the ASI sponsors a number of programs aimed at promoting these values.

<li>Poland's first post-communist leader, <a>Lech Wa&#x0142;&#x0119;sa</a></li>
Almost 40% of students from graduating classes have participated in one of these programs.</p>
<p>The heart of the campus includes the George S. Benson Auditorium, which hosts daily chapel and sits facing the McInteer Bible and World Missions Center.
Brackett Library, the American Studies Building (Education and English departments, the American Heritage Center (hotel and offices), and the Administration Building frame a grassy central commons area upon which can be found several paths, a fountain, and a bell tower made out of bricks from the institution that once stood there: Galloway Women's College.
Expansions of the cafeteria, student center, art department, American Heritage Center, along with the addition of the Bible Center, came with the closing of the road that once ran through that part of campus.
It is now a pedestrian mall.</p>
<p>After years of playing in the Ganus Athletic Center, Harding's basketball teams moved back to the Rhodes Memorial Field House, a round-topped airplane hangar from WWII.
The &quot;old gym&quot; as it was once called was retrofitted to accentuate the already deafening acoustics of the facility, which has worked to the advantage of the home team.
<p>The campus lies roughly between Race Avenue and Beebe-Capps Expressway and includes several other minor thoroughfares, the campus of <a>Harding Academy</a>, Harding Place (a retirement home), and portions of surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The social club induction process begins when clubs host &quot;mixers&quot; in the fall to recruit new members.
The membership process culminates in Club Week, when each prospective member bonds with the other members of the club through a series of scheduled activities throughout the week.</p>

<h2>Policies and code of conduct</h2>
<p>In keeping with an expectation of &quot;highest standards of morality, integrity, orderliness and personal honor,&quot; Harding has a number of rules that were designed to foster these standards on campus.</p>
Additionally, students must complete at least 8 hours of Bible courses in order to complete the Liberal Arts curriculum.
&quot;First Time In College&quot; (FTIC) students must take a survey course in New Testament during the fall of their first year, followed by a survey of the Old Testament in the spring.</p>
The consumption of alcohol is also prohibited for students and faculty both on and off campus.
A violation of this policy usually results in expulsion for one semester.
<p>Students and faculty may not participate in any sexual activity outside of what the school considers to be traditional marriage.
<p>Harding has competed in the GSC since 2000 and in the NCAA since 1997 and will move to the newly formed Great American Conference beginning in the Fall of 2011.</p>

<p>The men's basketball program, led by coach Jeff Morgan, has been successful since moving to the NCAA, reaching the Division II Tournament twice during his tenure: for the first time in school history in 2003, and more recently in 2008.
<p>Backed by the &quot;Rhodes Rowdies,&quot; HU men's basketball has averaged approximately 2,000 in home attendance since joining the NCAA, a figure which would typically be greater than that of one-third of Division-I teams [<a>http://www.ncaa.org/stats/m_basketball/attendance/index.html</a>].
Entering the 2008-09 season, Harding owned seven of the top ten single-game attendance records in GSC basketball history.
Despite their passing success, the 2008 team was overcome by the GSC's second-worst scoring defense, leaving the Bisons with a 2-9 record.</p>
