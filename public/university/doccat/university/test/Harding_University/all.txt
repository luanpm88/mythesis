nickname$$$@@@%%%<h2>American Studies Institute</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Harding American Studies Institute is designed to supplement students' academic training and promote &quot;a complete understanding of the institutions, values, and ideas of liberty and democracy.&quot;[<a>http://www.harding.edu/asi/info.html</a>]
established$$$@@@%%%In doing so, the ASI exhibits a generally conservative political stance, focused on going &quot;back to the fundamental values that made this country great.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The formal roots of this program date back to 1953, when Harding formed the School of American Studies.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to the formal foundation of the ASI, Harding was also involved in the production of a series of animated cartoons extolling the virtues of free-market capitalism.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This, too, forms a precursor to the political conservatism that has characterized the ASI.
established$$$@@@%%%This series, including 1948's  &quot;Make Mine Freedom&quot; (which, ironically, portrays activities not permitted by Harding's code of conduct at the time) and &quot;Going Places&quot;, as well as 1951's  &quot;Meet King Joe&quot;, were all produced by John Southerland Productions as part of a concerted propaganda program to fight against the perceived threats of <a>communism</a> at the beginning of the <a>Cold War</a> using popular media.
established$$$@@@%%%The animations portray mainstream American values, some of which might now be considered politically &quot;liberal,&quot; yet at the time, they were meant to contrast with the values of Soviet and Maoist <a>socialism</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The initiative represented a central concern of Harding president George S. Benson, who believed that fighting socialism was a moral imperative, causing him to abandon the pacifism and political disengagement championed by founding influences <a>James A. Harding</a> and <a>David Lipscomb</a>, reversing the university's course and setting it on its current conservative political trajectory.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Currently, the ASI sponsors a number of programs aimed at promoting these values.
country$$$@@@%%%These include entrepreneurial and leadership programs, a distinguished student honors program, the Belden Center for Private Enterprise Education, and participation in the Walton Scholars Program, which brings in qualified students from Hispanic countries to Arkansas colleges and universities.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Lecture series</h3>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>One of the most visible aspects of the American Studies Institute is the distinguished lecturer program.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In keeping with Harding University's current conservative political and religious leanings, the American Studies Institute invites distinguished lecturers to speak on campus on a regular basis.
staff$$$@@@%%%Typically, there are four lectures in an academic year.

students$$$@@@%%%Currently there are 13 women's social clubs and 14 men's social clubs at Harding.
country$$$@@@%%%Social clubs are open to all academically eligible students and serve as some of the university's most visible student-led organizations.
staff$$$@@@%%%The clubs are a prominent part of student life with slightly more than half of all undergraduate students participating as social club members.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The social club induction process begins when clubs host &quot;mixers&quot; in the fall to recruit new members.
free$$$@@@%%%Prospective members then complete a &quot;visitation,&quot; which requires that they meet and interview every current member of the club.
established$$$@@@%%%The membership process culminates in Club Week, when each prospective member bonds with the other members of the club through a series of scheduled activities throughout the week.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>At the end of the week, potential members are scored, and if their efforts are sufficient, they are accepted into the club.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Once a student is accepted into the club, they attend biweekly meetings and can participate in club-sponsored sports, service projects, and Spring Sing.</p>
