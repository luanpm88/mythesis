<p> The <strong>University of Central Lancashire</strong> (or <strong>UCLan</strong>) is a <a>university</a> based in <a>Preston</a>, <a>Lancashire</a>, <a>England</a>, <a>UK</a>.</p>
<p>The university has its roots in <em>The Institution For The Diffusion Of Useful Knowledge</em> which was founded in 1828.
In 1992 it was granted University status by the <a>Privy Council</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Institution for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was founded in 1828 by <a>Joseph Livesey</a>'s <a>Temperance Society</a>.
The society was born from a pledge made by seven Preston working men (whose names can be seen on a plaque in the university's library) to never again consume alcohol.</p>
<p>The Institute was housed in a classical-revivalist building on Cannon Street, before eventually expanding under the endowment of a local lawyer, Edmund Robert Harris, who died in 1877.
The expansion brought with it several new buildings and houses in the nearby Regent Street were purchased and demolished as a consequence.
The institute became a regional centre of excellence for the arts and sciences.
<p>As part of <a>Queen Victoria</a>'s  <a>Diamond Jubilee</a> celebrations in 1897, the Institute's trustees paid the <a>Victorian</a>/<a>Edwardian</a> architect Henry Cheers to design the &quot;Victoria Jubilee Technical School&quot; (later known as the Harris Institute and now known as the Harris Building), to be built on Corporation Street.
Its goal was to provide local youths with a technical education in all areas.
The building was progressive for the period, being powered entirely by electricity.</p>
<p>The Institute existed in this state until 1932 when it changed its name to become the Harris Art College.
It underwent further expansion and in 1952 and became the Harris College.
In 1992, full university status was awarded and the University of Central Lancashire came into existence.</p>
