established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Institution for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was founded in 1828 by <a>Joseph Livesey</a>'s <a>Temperance Society</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The society was born from a pledge made by seven Preston working men (whose names can be seen on a plaque in the university's library) to never again consume alcohol.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Institute was housed in a classical-revivalist building on Cannon Street, before eventually expanding under the endowment of a local lawyer, Edmund Robert Harris, who died in 1877.
established$$$@@@%%%The expansion brought with it several new buildings and houses in the nearby Regent Street were purchased and demolished as a consequence.
established$$$@@@%%%The institute became a regional centre of excellence for the arts and sciences.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>As part of <a>Queen Victoria</a>'s  <a>Diamond Jubilee</a> celebrations in 1897, the Institute's trustees paid the <a>Victorian</a>/<a>Edwardian</a> architect Henry Cheers to design the &quot;Victoria Jubilee Technical School&quot; (later known as the Harris Institute and now known as the Harris Building), to be built on Corporation Street.
established$$$@@@%%%Its goal was to provide local youths with a technical education in all areas.
established$$$@@@%%%The building was progressive for the period, being powered entirely by electricity.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Institute existed in this state until 1932 when it changed its name to become the Harris Art College.
established$$$@@@%%%It underwent further expansion and in 1952 and became the Harris College.
type$$$@@@%%%In 1973 this became Preston Polytechnic then the Lancashire Polytechnic in 1984.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1992, full university status was awarded and the University of Central Lancashire came into existence.</p>
