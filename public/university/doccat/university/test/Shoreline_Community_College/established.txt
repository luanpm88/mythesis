<h2>History</h2>
Note the high roof element and the rocks representing a stream as in a traditional Japanese garden.</a>
Shoreline Community College was the brain-child of Dr. Ray W. Howard, <a>Superintendent</a> of the <a>Shoreline School District</a>.
He felt that Washington state's increasing host of high school graduates did not have adequate opportunities for higher education, and in 1959 he brought forward the idea of a community college in Shoreline.</p>
<p>After several years of research and development, Shoreline Community College began operations on January 2, 1964.
Howard resigned his position as superintendent to serve in the temporary position of Administrative Officer of Shoreline Community College until the college had hired its first president, William K. Ramstad.</p>
<p>During its first two years, evening classes were held at <a>Shoreline High School</a> until the college had established its permanent campus.
Through local levies and a grant from the <a>Washington State Board of Education</a>, the college was able to purchase land from the <a>Boeing family</a>, and construction of the campus began in the fall of 1964.
The campus opened to students in January, 1966.</p>
The Library also houses eLearning, the department that helps students and faculty with their online learning needs.
In addition, students can use AskWA, a 24/7 chat reference service, to get reference help and information literacy instruction when the physical library is closed.
AskWA is accessible on the <a>Library home page</a>, through a little green Washington State icon on the lower left side of the page.</p>
<p>In 2006 Shoreline Community College was recognized as one of 27 colleges nationwide to offer NAFTC's <a>alternative fuel vehicle</a> (AFV) training and outreach center.
