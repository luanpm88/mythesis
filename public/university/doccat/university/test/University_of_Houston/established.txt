On March 7, 1927, trustees of the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> <a>Board of Education</a> unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college.
The junior college was operated and controlled by the <a>Houston Independent School District</a> (HISD).</p>
<p>Originally HJC was located in <a>San Jacinto High School</a> and offered only night courses.
Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty.
The first president of HJC was <a>Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer</a>, who was the dominant force in establishing the <a>junior college</a>.</p>
<h3>University beginnings</h3>
<p>The junior college became eligible to become a <a>four-year institution</a> in October 1933 when Governor <a>Miriam A. Ferguson</a> signed House Bill 194 into law.
On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College became the University of Houston.</p>

and forces from <a>state universities</a> geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.

At the game, members of the opposing team discovered what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent.
