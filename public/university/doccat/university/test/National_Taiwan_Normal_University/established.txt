<p><strong>National Taiwan Normal University</strong> (<strong>NTNU</strong> or <em>Sh&#x012b;d&#x00e0;</em> ) is an institution of higher learning operating on three campuses in <a>Taipei</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>.
NTNU is widely recognized as one of Taiwan's elite institutions of higher education.
<p>In 1946 <a>China</a>'s <a>Kuomintang government</a> assumed control of Taiwan and redefined the school as Taiwan Provincial Teachers College.
Some school publications still display 1946 as the institution's founding date in reference to this regime change.
In 1956 the <a>Mandarin Training Center</a> opened its doors as an extension of the college.
The school acquired its present name, National Taiwan Normal University, in 1967.
By now the school had established itself as a recognized center of learning in arts, literature and the humanities; its fundamental mission, though, remained the preparation of teachers.</p>
<p>As Taiwan made its modern shift to <a>democracy</a> in the 1990s the university saw its role transformed by passage of the 1994 Teacher Preparation Law.
The law gave responsibility for teacher training to more schools and set NTNU on its present course as a truly comprehensive university.
The university became a hub of international activity, enabling Taiwanese students to travel abroad, attracting international students to Taipei, and building exchange programs with dozens of sister institutions around the world.

<p>The standard abbreviation for the National Taiwan Normal University in English is <em>NTNU</em>.
The word &quot;Shida&quot; in many Taipei place names (Shida Night Market, Shida Road, Shida Bookstore, etc.) indicates a location on or near the university campus.</p>
<p>The word <em>normal</em> in the university's name derives from a now archaic usage of the work &quot;normal&quot; see only in the term &quot;<a>normal school</a>&quot;: that of an <a>norm</a>-setting institution setting for future teachers.</p>
<p><em>MTC</em> refers to the <a>Mandarin Training Center</a>.</p>
