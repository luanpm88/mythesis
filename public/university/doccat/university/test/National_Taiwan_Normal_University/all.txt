established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>National Taiwan Normal University</strong> (<strong>NTNU</strong> or <em>Sh&#x012b;d&#x00e0;</em> ) is an institution of higher learning operating on three campuses in <a>Taipei</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%NTNU is widely recognized as one of Taiwan's elite institutions of higher education.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%The university enrolls approximately 11,000 students each year.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%The ratio of undergraduate to graduate students is 6:4.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Approximately 1,500 students are international.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1946 <a>China</a>'s <a>Kuomintang government</a> assumed control of Taiwan and redefined the school as Taiwan Provincial Teachers College.
established$$$@@@%%%Some school publications still display 1946 as the institution's founding date in reference to this regime change.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1956 the <a>Mandarin Training Center</a> opened its doors as an extension of the college.
established$$$@@@%%%The school acquired its present name, National Taiwan Normal University, in 1967.
established$$$@@@%%%By now the school had established itself as a recognized center of learning in arts, literature and the humanities; its fundamental mission, though, remained the preparation of teachers.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As Taiwan made its modern shift to <a>democracy</a> in the 1990s the university saw its role transformed by passage of the 1994 Teacher Preparation Law.
established$$$@@@%%%The law gave responsibility for teacher training to more schools and set NTNU on its present course as a truly comprehensive university.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%New departments were created, course offerings and majors were expanded, and new faculty were hired.
established$$$@@@%%%The university became a hub of international activity, enabling Taiwanese students to travel abroad, attracting international students to Taipei, and building exchange programs with dozens of sister institutions around the world.
