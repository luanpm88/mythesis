Legally, the combined corporation of the two colleges, Hobart College and William Smith College, is <strong>The Colleges of the Seneca</strong>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><strong>Hobart College</strong> traces its roots to Geneva Academy, founded in 1796 by the Rev. Henry Axtell.
Hobart College proper was founded in 1822 as <strong>Geneva College</strong> and renamed in honor of its founder, <a>Episcopal</a> bishop <a>John Henry Hobart</a>, in 1852.
<p>Geneva at the time was a bustling <a>Upstate New York</a> city on the main land and stage coach route to the West.
When John Henry Hobart, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, visited Geneva in 1818, Geneva Academy had temporarily closed its doors.
Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the Academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status.</p>
<p>Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a little frontier settlement.
It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva.
The area was considered &quot;the gateway to Genesee County&quot; and was in the early stages of development from the wilderness.</p>
<p>The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825 and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College.</p>
<p>The period of greatest prosperity for the school occurred between the years 1840 to 1850.
<p>Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the head of her class, the first woman doctor in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Blackwell went on to found the New York Infirmary for Women and Children and had a role in the creation of its medical college.</p>
In addition, the building, built in 1901, and named after Bishop Arthur Clevland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, houses the president's office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing which was added in the 1920s.
Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school.
The building was designed by <a>Clinton and Russell</a> Architects.</p>
<p><strong>Scandling Campus Center</strong>, Named after <a>William F. Scandling</a>, alumni of Hobart College, Scandling Center is the central hub of student life.
Scandling, renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).</p>
<p><strong>Gulick Hall</strong>, built in 1951 as part of the post-war &quot;mini-boom&quot; that also included the construction of the Hobart &quot;mini-quad&quot; dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th Century Hobart College president), Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar.
Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 prior to its renovation in 1992.</p>
<p><strong>Smith Hall</strong>, built in 1907, Smith Hall originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments.
It is now home to the Dean's Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments.
Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Williams Hall</strong>, 1907, built to house the first campus gymnasium, it served several other lives as campus post office, and book store after the construction of Bristol gymnasium.
Houses the departments of religious studies, philosophy, and English and comparative literature.
Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.
(Upjohn's grandson, <a>Hobart Upjohn</a> would additionally design several of the College's buildings as well).
Demarest served, until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s, as the College's library.
In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the College's growing number of volumes.</p>
Trinity served a bout as a Dormitory, a library, and classroom building, but was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century.
<p><strong>Merrit Hall</strong>, built in 1879, Merrit was built of the ruins of the old medical college.
Merrit was the first science building on campus, it housed the chemistry labs.
Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building.
On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times.
Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith.
John's Chapel</strong>, Designed by <a>Richard Upjohn</a> the architect of <a>Trinity Church</a> in New York City, St. John's served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original Campus chapel.
The country mansion was built in the 1880s by <a>William J. King</a> .
It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family's summer home.
Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion's interior to the present classical decor in 1913.
Helen Vail's heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a woman's dormitory.
After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center.
The building is now home to the Davis art gallery, the Architecture studios on the top floor, lecture rooms, and multiple faculty offices.</p>
<p><strong>Katherine D. Elliot Hall</strong>, constructed in 2006, the &quot;Elliot&quot; houses  of art classrooms, offices, studios for painting and photography and printing, wood and metal shops.</p>
<p><strong>Goldstein Family Carriage House</strong>, Built originally by William J. King in 1882, the carriage house was renovated in 2006 to house a digital imaging lab and a photo studio with a dark room for black and white photography.</p>
<p><strong>Warren Hunting Smith Library</strong>, In the center of the campus, the Warren Hunting Smith Library houses 385,000 volumes, 12,000 periodicals and more than 8,000 VHS and DVD videos.
<p><strong>Rosenberg Hall</strong>, named for Henry A. Rosenberg (Hobart '52), the building is an annex of Lansing and Eaton Hall, the original science buildings.
Eaton, one of New York's outstanding ornithologists, and was one of the professors brought here with William Smith grants funds.
He received the Distinguished Faculty Award in 1992.
Eaton Hall is a part of the science complex at the south end of the Hobart Quad which consists of Lansing, Rosenberg, and Napier.</p>
<p><strong>Medbery Hall</strong>, An original Hobart College dorm dating from the 1900.
Medbery defines the right side of the Hobart Quadrangle.
Designed by <a>Clinton and Russell</a> architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarity their Jacobian Gothic style.
Medbery was designed without long hallways &quot;conductive to rioting&quot; and mischief, such as rolling a cannon ball down the hallway.
Such mischef was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls</p>
<p><strong>Geneva Hall</strong> Built in 1822, <a>Geneva Hall</a> is the college's first building, the site being designated by the School's founder, Bishop <a>John Henry Hobart</a>.
The building is one of the oldest academic building in continuous use, having served as a dormitory, among other uses since its completion.
The building has inscribed into it's quoins, and alongside the perimeter of its facade, plaques which list the graduates of classes dating back to the 19th century.</p>
In the 2006-2007 academic year, Durfee was made the temporary home to one floor of William Smith students.
<p><strong>Bartlett Hall</strong>,Bartlett Hall was named after the Reverend Murray Bartlett, who served as fourteenth president of Hobart College from 1919 to 1936</p>
<p><strong>Durfee Hall</strong>, Durfee Hall was named after William Pitt Durfee, who from 1884 to 1929 served as professor of mathematics and chair of the mathematics department.
He was the first dean of a liberal arts college and served as acting president of the Colleges four times</p>
The hill, was the originally planned site for William Smith College.
Located at the top of a large sloping hill to the West of Seneca Lake and the Hobart Quad, the hill houses three historic William Smith dorms, and one built in the 1960s.
Unveiled in 2008 for the William Smith Centennial is a statue of the college's founder and benefactor, William Smith.</p>
<p><strong>Blackwell House</strong>, Designed and built in 1860 by <a>Richard Upjohn</a> as a residence for William Douglass, who served as a trustee of Hobart College.
The house was purchased in 1908 as the first William Smith Dormitory.
The house still houses William Smith students, and is known for its grand Victorian features from fireplaces, to chandeliers, to large old windows.</p>
<p><strong>Comstock House</strong>, Designed by <a>Richard Upjohn's</a> grandson, Hobart Upjohn, in 1932, Comstock is a women's dormitory named for Anna Botsford Comstock, friend of William Smith and the first woman to be named a member of the Board of Trustees.</p>

The building is home to William Smith students.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson, Potter, Rees</strong>, together known as JPR for short, the three identical buildings create their own quad in the south end of campus.
The dorms were built in 1966 and are named after various historical figures of Hobart College.
The building was completely renovated in 2005 to include quad living spaces (two double bed rooms connected by a common living room) and the construction of open lounge spaces and lounges on every floor.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson Hall</strong>, is named for Abner Jackson, president of the Hobart in the middle of the 19th century, who would go on to become president of <a>Trinity College</a> in Connecticut, where he would be the principal designer of their present campus.</p>

The Colleges own the  Hanley Biological Field Station and Preserve on neighboring <a>Cayuga Lake</a> as well as playing host to the <a>Finger Lakes Institute</a>, a non-profit focusing on education and ecological preservation for the Finger Lakes area.</p>
<p>The Colleges also own and operate <a>WEOS</a>-FM and <a>WHWS-LP</a> public radio stations broadcasting throughout the Finger Lakes and worldwide, on the web.</p>
<p>When many single-sex institutions became co-ed in the 1960s and '70s, both Hobart and William Smith retained their separate identities while integrating many aspects of student life in an arrangement called the &#x201c;Coordinate System&#x201d;.
Emblematic of the nature of this system is the sculpture of a scissors embedded in the lawn south of the library: two separate entities, joined together in order to work as a whole.
Hobart College allows <a>fraternities</a> and Greek organizations while William Smith does not allow <a>sororities</a>.</p>
<p>A male graduate receives a degree from Hobart College and a female graduate from William Smith College.
Hobart has Charter Day, which celebrates the 1822 founding and its own honor societies:  The Druid Society for seniors (founded 1903), Chimera Society (juniors, 1910) and Orange Key (sophomores, 1926).
Each society has specific roles and functions on campus.</p>
