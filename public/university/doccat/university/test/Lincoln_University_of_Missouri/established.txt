<p>The school was founded in 1866 by members of the 62nd and 65th <a>United States Colored Infantry</a> under the name Lincoln Institute.
They wanted to provide an education to <a>African Americans</a> through the combining of academics and labor.
This was an industrial school model along the lines of <a>Booker T. Washington</a>'s influential <a>Tuskegee Institute</a>.
Under the <a>Morrill Act of 1890</a>, the school was designated a <a>land-grant university</a>.
By 1921, the college had expanded to offer graduate programs and was officially designated a <a>university</a> by the state of Missouri.
It changed its name to &quot;Lincoln University of Missouri.&quot;
In 1954, it opened its doors to applicants of all races.
