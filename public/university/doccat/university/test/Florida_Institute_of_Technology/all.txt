type$$$@@@%%%<p>  <strong>Florida Institute of Technology</strong>, also known as <strong>Florida Tech</strong>, is an independent private <a>technical research university</a> located in <a>Melbourne, Florida</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1958 as Brevard  Engineering College, the institute has been known by its present name since 1966.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%Florida Tech's curriculum is largely focused on <a>engineering</a> and science fields.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%As of 2008, the institute had an on campus student body of 6,400, almost equally divided between graduate- and undergraduate-level students, with the plurality of them focusing their studies on engineering and the sciences.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As of 2009, its student body was roughly 10,000 combined on campus and online.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|Miller Building</a> In the beginning, classes were held in leased classrooms at <a>Eau Gallie Junior High School</a> (now Westshore Junior/Senior High School at 250 West Brevard Avenue) and at University of Melbourne's lone building on Country Club Boulevard.
established$$$@@@%%%Classes were moved from <a>Eau Gallie Junior High School</a> to Melbourne Methodist Church on Waverly St. in 1959 after the school district disapproved of two black students using the junior high school classrooms.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1961, Brevard Engineering College purchased the property of the University of Melbourne (Florida) which became the main campus in the heart of Melbourne, Florida.
established$$$@@@%%%The only existing building at the time was the current Ray A. Work building.
established$$$@@@%%%The next building to be built was the Keuper building, originally used as a library.
students$$$@@@%%%Today it houses the Admissions, Financial Aid and Student Employment departments.
image_size$$$@@@%%%In the 1960s and 1970s many buildings were constructed on the main campus.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since 1996 the university has been in the midst of much construction and expansion.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Following a $50 million grant given to them by the F. W. Olin Foundation, Florida Tech has constructed three new facilities for their engineering, life science, and physical science departments.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 1990s Florida Institute of Technology changed its promotional identity from FIT to <strong>Florida Tech</strong>, to avoid confusion with the <a>Fashion Institute of Technology</a> at the <a>State University of New York</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This name change created some confusion in the <a>Orlando, Florida</a> area with the existing <a>Florida Technical College</a> and Florida Technological University, the former name of the <a>University of Central Florida</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|Historic sign from Florida Tech Alumni Association and Florida Department of State.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%As part of Florida Tech's 50th Anniversary celebration, new constructions began in summer of 2006 with the construction of the Panthereum, a concert and lecture venue located adjacent to the Homer Denius Student Center.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The south campus began expansion as well.
established$$$@@@%%%A new, three-building residence hall complex, Harris Village, was completed in time for the fall 2008 semester.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>More south campus construction began in 2008 with the start of the Scott Center for Autism Treatment and the Harris Center for Science and Engineering.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Construction will begin in 2009 on a new dining center, parking complex, and NCAA-certified swimming pool and diving center.

website$$$@@@%%%<h3>Geographic history</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|Florida Tech Panther</a> The northern part of Florida Tech's main campus contains some rich history.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The headwaters of <a>Crane Creek</a> are located here, and the creek begins in the Botanical Gardens southeast of Columbia Village Suites.
nickname$$$@@@%%%These Botanical Gardens, colloquially referred to as 'The Jungle', occupy much of the northeastern part of the main campus and are home to a wide variety of local species, with transient visits from alligators and manatees.
established$$$@@@%%%Crisscrossed by several trails (the main one is named for Dent Smith), they contain a collection of many varieties of palm trees and other flora.
staff$$$@@@%%%Numerous bridges on campus provide crossings over two of the three streams that feed Crane Creek.
established$$$@@@%%%The third stream comes south from the Roberts Hall and Columbia Village Suites area to the north.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Jungle is colloquially divided into the &quot;near Jungle&quot; and &quot;deep Jungle&quot;, with the former consisting of the area near campus with paved or wooden paths and bridges and the latter consisting of the more distant portions in which trails are simply worn paths through the vegetation.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The plants and structures of the near Jungle are actively maintained by campus, while the deep Jungle has reverted to primarily Florida wilderness.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Small wooden pagodas are scattered through the deep jungle, and students have previously set up hammocks.
faculty$$$@@@%%%There are numerous &quot;regions&quot; of the deep jungle, characterized by their flora, including a heavily wooded area lacking significant undergrowth and an area directly behind Evans Dormitory replete with extremely large <a>pothos</a>.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>This area around Crane Creek was known as Cathead in the early 1900s after numerous panthers that lived in this area.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Melbourne's first (one-room) wooden school house is here, at the end of the Dent Smith Trail, northwest of the Evans Library.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The railroad of the <a>Union Cypress Company</a> traveled from east to west here just south of the Crawford Science  Tower.
established$$$@@@%%%It carried lumber from cypress swamps to the west, to the former mill town of Hopkins, just south of Crane Creek and <a>U.S. 1</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Jensen Beach Campus</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> In 1968, the Hydrospace Technical Institute (HTI) was chartered in a donated building in Cocoa  Beach.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1972, the campus of <a>Saint Joseph College of Florida</a> located on the <a>Indian River</a> in <a>Jensen Beach, Florida</a> was purchased with the support of <a>Ralph Evinrude</a>, owner of <a>Outboard Marine Corporation</a> and husband of <a>Frances Langford</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The HTI was moved to Jensen Beach, and became the School of Marine and Environmental Technology(SOMET).
established$$$@@@%%%The Jensen Beach campus closed in 1986 and SOMET was transferred to the main campus to become the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences(DMES).
established$$$@@@%%%An <a>MBA</a> program had been started on the campus and it was continued for a time in rented quarters on East Ocean Boulevard in <a>Sewall's Point</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus in Jensen  Beach was subsequently sold.
established$$$@@@%%%The dormitories and cafeteria located on the hill west of N.E.
established$$$@@@%%%Sewall's Point Road were torn down and replaced by an assisted living facility.
established$$$@@@%%%The rest of the campus lying east of Sewall's Point Road is now owned by the <a>Martin County</a> government and is now the <a>Martin County</a> Indian Riverside Park.
established$$$@@@%%%The old chapel building is being converted into the <a>Children's Museum of Martin County</a> while the former administration building (once a home called <a>Tuckahoe</a>) located on <a>Mount Elizabeth</a>, which is actually  a <a>Native American</a> <a>midden</a>, is being restored by the Friends of Mount Elizabeth.
established$$$@@@%%%The library and classroom buildings and the old metal building were all demolished.</p>
