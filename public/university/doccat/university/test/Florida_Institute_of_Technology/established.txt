Founded in 1958 as Brevard  Engineering College, the institute has been known by its present name since 1966.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Miller Building</a> In the beginning, classes were held in leased classrooms at <a>Eau Gallie Junior High School</a> (now Westshore Junior/Senior High School at 250 West Brevard Avenue) and at University of Melbourne's lone building on Country Club Boulevard.
Classes were moved from <a>Eau Gallie Junior High School</a> to Melbourne Methodist Church on Waverly St. in 1959 after the school district disapproved of two black students using the junior high school classrooms.
<p>In 1961, Brevard Engineering College purchased the property of the University of Melbourne (Florida) which became the main campus in the heart of Melbourne, Florida.
The only existing building at the time was the current Ray A. Work building.
The next building to be built was the Keuper building, originally used as a library.
<p>Since 1996 the university has been in the midst of much construction and expansion.
<p>In the early 1990s Florida Institute of Technology changed its promotional identity from FIT to <strong>Florida Tech</strong>, to avoid confusion with the <a>Fashion Institute of Technology</a> at the <a>State University of New York</a>.
This name change created some confusion in the <a>Orlando, Florida</a> area with the existing <a>Florida Technical College</a> and Florida Technological University, the former name of the <a>University of Central Florida</a>.</p>

As part of Florida Tech's 50th Anniversary celebration, new constructions began in summer of 2006 with the construction of the Panthereum, a concert and lecture venue located adjacent to the Homer Denius Student Center.
A new, three-building residence hall complex, Harris Village, was completed in time for the fall 2008 semester.</p>
<p>More south campus construction began in 2008 with the start of the Scott Center for Autism Treatment and the Harris Center for Science and Engineering.
Crisscrossed by several trails (the main one is named for Dent Smith), they contain a collection of many varieties of palm trees and other flora.
The third stream comes south from the Roberts Hall and Columbia Village Suites area to the north.
<p>Melbourne's first (one-room) wooden school house is here, at the end of the Dent Smith Trail, northwest of the Evans Library.</p>
<p>The railroad of the <a>Union Cypress Company</a> traveled from east to west here just south of the Crawford Science  Tower.
It carried lumber from cypress swamps to the west, to the former mill town of Hopkins, just south of Crane Creek and <a>U.S. 1</a>.</p>
<p> In 1968, the Hydrospace Technical Institute (HTI) was chartered in a donated building in Cocoa  Beach.
In 1972, the campus of <a>Saint Joseph College of Florida</a> located on the <a>Indian River</a> in <a>Jensen Beach, Florida</a> was purchased with the support of <a>Ralph Evinrude</a>, owner of <a>Outboard Marine Corporation</a> and husband of <a>Frances Langford</a>.
The HTI was moved to Jensen Beach, and became the School of Marine and Environmental Technology(SOMET).
The Jensen Beach campus closed in 1986 and SOMET was transferred to the main campus to become the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences(DMES).
An <a>MBA</a> program had been started on the campus and it was continued for a time in rented quarters on East Ocean Boulevard in <a>Sewall's Point</a>.
The campus in Jensen  Beach was subsequently sold.
The dormitories and cafeteria located on the hill west of N.E.
Sewall's Point Road were torn down and replaced by an assisted living facility.
The rest of the campus lying east of Sewall's Point Road is now owned by the <a>Martin County</a> government and is now the <a>Martin County</a> Indian Riverside Park.
The old chapel building is being converted into the <a>Children's Museum of Martin County</a> while the former administration building (once a home called <a>Tuckahoe</a>) located on <a>Mount Elizabeth</a>, which is actually  a <a>Native American</a> <a>midden</a>, is being restored by the Friends of Mount Elizabeth.
The library and classroom buildings and the old metal building were all demolished.</p>
Original format moved into bottom of &quot;FIT dormitory&quot; article, still formatted in case someone wants to try to resuscitate it-----&gt; &lt;!---The history of naming is important, as this individuals contributed to the future of this university---&gt;</p>

<p>In 2008, Florida Institute of Technology&#x2019;s endowment was approximately $42 million, significantly lower than other competitive technical universities like Virginia Tech, MIT, and Georgia Tech, mainly due to Florida Tech&#x2019;s short history.
It is projected that the university&#x2019;s financial structure will improve by 2014, to increase its endowment to $100 million or more.</p>

<p> A highly residential campus, Florida Tech has seven traditional residence halls, an eight-building Southgate Apartments complex, the seven-building Columbia Village suites and three-building Harris Village suites.</p>
<p>&lt;!---Got to be more than generals but that's what someone researched.
US Congressmen, Mayor of large cities, Presidents of corporations we've all heard of (!).
&lt;!---Hopefully whoever wrote that comment sees that the new alum list has notable people like the Director of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in addition to some more astronauts.---&gt;
