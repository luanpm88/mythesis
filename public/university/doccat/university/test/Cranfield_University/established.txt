<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>250px|thumb|right|The new School, 'Cranfield Health' prior to official opening, May 2008, viewed from the Library</a> The University was formed in 1946 as the College of Aeronautics on the former <a>Royal Air Force</a> base of <a>RAF Cranfield</a> which opened in 1937.
(See also entries on <a>Harold Roxbee Cox</a>, Sir <a>Stafford Cripps</a> and <a>Roy Fedden</a>, all individuals associated with the foundation of the original College of Aeronautics).
Between 1955 and 1969 a period of diversification took place.
In 1967 the college presented the <a>Privy Council</a> with a <a>petition</a> for the grant of a <a>Royal Charter</a> along with a draft charter for a new institution to be called Cranfield Institute of Technology.
The Cranfield Institute of Technology was incorporated by <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1969, giving the institution its own <a>degree</a>-awarding powers.<a>250px|thumb|right|The
new School, 'Cranfield Health' interior</a>Since then the former <a>National College of Agricultural Engineering</a> established at <a>Silsoe</a> near <a>Luton</a>, <a>Bedfordshire</a>, in the 1960s, was incorporated.
An academic partnership with the Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) at <a>Shrivenham</a> was formed in 1984.
RMCS, whose roots can be traced back to 1772, is now a part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom and now forms the Defence College of Management and Technology, known as 'DCMT' and from 2009 as &quot;Cranfield Defence and Security&quot;.
<p>The first 50 year history of Cranfield University is described comprehensively, but concisely, by the book <em>Field of Vision</em>.</p>
As a result, a substantial building program was undertaken on Cranfield campus, including the provision of departmental buildings and additional accommodation (<a>Stringfellow</a> and Chilver Halls), and Silsoe-based staff were transferred to Cranfield.</p>
<p><a>Cranfield</a> campus is approximately  north of central London and adjacent to the village of Cranfield, Bedfordshire.
<p><a>Shrivenham</a> is about  west of London, adjacent to Shrivenham village,  from the centre of the nearest town, <a>Swindon</a>, and around  from <a>Oxford</a>.</p>
