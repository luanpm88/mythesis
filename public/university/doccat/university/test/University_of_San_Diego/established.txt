<p>The <strong>University of San Diego</strong> (<strong>USD</strong>) is a <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>university</a> in <a>San Diego</a>, <a>California</a>.
USD offers more than sixty <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master&#x2019;s</a>, and <a>doctoral</a> programs.
The university consists of six schools: the School of Business Administration, the School of Leadership and Education Sciences, the School of Law, the School of Nursing &amp; Health Science, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>float|thumb|left|210px|Immaculata Parish Church at USD showing the architectural style of the campus.</a></p>
<p>Chartered in 1949, the University opened its doors to its first class of students in 1952 as the <a>San Diego College for Women</a>.
Most Reverend <a>Charles F. Buddy, D.D.</a>, then bishop of the <a>Diocese of San Diego</a> and Reverend Mother Rosalie Hill, RSCJ, a Superior <a>Vicar</a>ess of the <a>Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>, chartered the institution from resources drawn from their respective organizations on a stretch of land known as &quot;Alcal&#x00e1; Park,&quot; named for <a>San Diego de Alcal&#x00e1;</a>.
In September 1954, the San Diego College for Men and the School of Law opened.
These two schools originally occupied Bogue Hall on the same site of University High School, which would later become the home of the <a>University of San Diego High School</a>.
Starting in 1954, Alcal&#x00e1; Park also served as the diocesan chancery office and housed the episcopal offices, until the diocese moved to a vacated Benedictine convent that was converted to a pastoral center.
The Immaculata Chapel, now no longer affiliated with USD, also opened that year as part of the seminary facilities.
Immaculate Heart closed at the end of 1968, when its building was renamed De Sales Hall; St. Francis remained open until 1970, when it was transferred to another location on campus, leaving all of the newly named Bishop Leo T. Maher Hall to the newly merged co-educational University of San Diego in 1972.
Since then, the university has grown quickly and has been able to increase its assets and academic programs.
<p><a>thumb|right|210px|The Universidad de Alcal&#x00e1; in Spain, inspiration for Mother Hill's USD</a> Significant periods of expansion of the university, since the 1972 merger, occurred in the mid-1980s, as well as in 1998, when <a>Joan B. Kroc</a>, philanthropist and wife of <a>McDonald's</a> financier <a>Ray Kroc</a>, endowed USD with a gift of $25 million for the construction of the Institute for Peace &amp; Justice.
Another significant donation to the college came in the form of multi-million dollar gifts from weight-loss tycoon <a>Jenny Craig</a>, inventor <a>Donald Shiley</a>, investment banker and alumnus Bert Degheri, and an additional gift of $50 million Mrs. Kroc left the IPJ upon her passing.
These gifts helped make possible, respectively, the <a>Jenny Craig Pavilion</a> (an athletic arena), the Donald P. Shiley Institute for Science and Technology, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice, and the Degheri Alumni Center.
As a result, USD has been able to host the West Coast Conference (WCC) basketball tournament in 2002, 2003 and 2008, and hosted international functions such as the <a>Kyoto Laureate Symposium</a> at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice.
In 2005, the university expanded the Colachis Plaza from the Immaculata along Marian Way to the east end of Hall, which effectively closed the east end of the campus to vehicular traffic.
That same year, the student body approved plans for a renovation and expansion of the Hahn University Center which began at the end of 2007.
The philosophy of USD's founderess and her fellow religious relied on the belief that studying in beautiful surroundings could improve the educational experience of students.
Thus, the university's buildings are designed in a 16th-century <a>Spanish Renaissance</a> architectural style, paying homage to both San Diego's Catholic heritage and the <a>Universidad de Alcal&#x00e1;</a> in Spain.</p>
<p>The campus is located approximately two miles north of downtown San Diego, on the north crest of <a>Mission Valley</a> in the community of <a>Linda Vista</a>.
From the westernmost edges of Alcal&#x00e1; Park the communities of <a>Mission Hills</a>, <a>Old Town</a>, <a>Point Loma</a>, <a>Ocean Beach</a>, Bay Park, <a>Mission Beach</a>, and <a>Pacific Beach</a> can be seen.
<p>Though a Catholic university, the school is no longer governed directly by the <a>Diocese of San Diego</a> or any <a>religious order</a>.
Today, a <a>lay</a><a>board of trustees</a> governs the university's operations.
However, the Bishop of San Diego, the Most Rev. Robert H. Brom, retains a seat as a permanent member and retains control of the school's designation of &quot;Catholic.&quot;</p>
<p><a>thumb|USD Courtyard</a> USD offers more than 60 degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels.

<p>Among its several projects is the Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management of which former <a>United States Attorney General</a> <a>Edwin Meese</a> was director from 1977 to 1981.</p>
Two important assets of the nursing school are its Simulation and Standardized Patient Nursing Laboratory  which opened in 2002, and the Master's Entry Program of Nursing (MEPN) .
The MEPN program allows students who already possess a bachelor's degree in another field but want to get into nursing the opportunity to take an accelerated program to earn a master's degree in clinical nursing.

<p>The Caster Family Center for Nonprofit Research was launched in 2004 with start-up <a>grant</a>s provided by The Westreich Foundation and the Bruce T. Halle Family Foundation.
In 2007 the Center received a naming contribution from the Caster family.

<p>Dean David F. Pyke joined the school in July, 2008 after having previously served as associate dean at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business where he ran Tuck's highly ranked MBA program.</p>
The <strong>Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice</strong> was established thanks to Mrs. Kroc's gift of $75 million in-all &quot;to not only teach peace, but make peace&quot;.
