established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>float|thumb|left|210px|Immaculata Parish Church at USD showing the architectural style of the campus.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Chartered in 1949, the University opened its doors to its first class of students in 1952 as the <a>San Diego College for Women</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Most Reverend <a>Charles F. Buddy, D.D.</a>, then bishop of the <a>Diocese of San Diego</a> and Reverend Mother Rosalie Hill, RSCJ, a Superior <a>Vicar</a>ess of the <a>Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>, chartered the institution from resources drawn from their respective organizations on a stretch of land known as &quot;Alcal&#x00e1; Park,&quot; named for <a>San Diego de Alcal&#x00e1;</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In September 1954, the San Diego College for Men and the School of Law opened.
established$$$@@@%%%These two schools originally occupied Bogue Hall on the same site of University High School, which would later become the home of the <a>University of San Diego High School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Starting in 1954, Alcal&#x00e1; Park also served as the diocesan chancery office and housed the episcopal offices, until the diocese moved to a vacated Benedictine convent that was converted to a pastoral center.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In 1957, Immaculate Heart Major Seminary and St. Francis Minor Seminary were moved into their newly completed facility, now known as Maher Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%The Immaculata Chapel, now no longer affiliated with USD, also opened that year as part of the seminary facilities.
city$$$@@@%%%For nearly two decades, these schools co-existed on Alcal&#x00e1; Park.
established$$$@@@%%%Immaculate Heart closed at the end of 1968, when its building was renamed De Sales Hall; St. Francis remained open until 1970, when it was transferred to another location on campus, leaving all of the newly named Bishop Leo T. Maher Hall to the newly merged co-educational University of San Diego in 1972.
established$$$@@@%%%Since then, the university has grown quickly and has been able to increase its assets and academic programs.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The student body, the local community, patrons, alumni, and many organizations have been integral to the university's development.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|210px|The Universidad de Alcal&#x00e1; in Spain, inspiration for Mother Hill's USD</a> Significant periods of expansion of the university, since the 1972 merger, occurred in the mid-1980s, as well as in 1998, when <a>Joan B. Kroc</a>, philanthropist and wife of <a>McDonald's</a> financier <a>Ray Kroc</a>, endowed USD with a gift of $25 million for the construction of the Institute for Peace &amp; Justice.
established$$$@@@%%%Another significant donation to the college came in the form of multi-million dollar gifts from weight-loss tycoon <a>Jenny Craig</a>, inventor <a>Donald Shiley</a>, investment banker and alumnus Bert Degheri, and an additional gift of $50 million Mrs. Kroc left the IPJ upon her passing.
established$$$@@@%%%These gifts helped make possible, respectively, the <a>Jenny Craig Pavilion</a> (an athletic arena), the Donald P. Shiley Institute for Science and Technology, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice, and the Degheri Alumni Center.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, USD has been able to host the West Coast Conference (WCC) basketball tournament in 2002, 2003 and 2008, and hosted international functions such as the <a>Kyoto Laureate Symposium</a> at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice.
students$$$@@@%%%Shiley's gift has provided the university with some additional, and more advanced, teaching laboratories that it had previously had.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2005, the university expanded the Colachis Plaza from the Immaculata along Marian Way to the east end of Hall, which effectively closed the east end of the campus to vehicular traffic.
established$$$@@@%%%That same year, the student body approved plans for a renovation and expansion of the Hahn University Center which began at the end of 2007.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The new Student Life Pavilion (SLP) opened in 2009 and hosts the university's new student dining area(s), offices for student organizations and event spaces.
