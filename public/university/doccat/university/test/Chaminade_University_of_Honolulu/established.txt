<p>Chaminade University of Honolulu was named after Father <a>William Joseph Chaminade</a>, a <a>French</a> Catholic priest who survived persecution during the <a>French Revolution</a>.
He founded the Society of Mary in 1817.
In September 1883, eight Marianist priests arrived in Honolulu and established Saint Louis School, today a high school for boys.
With the encouragement of Saint Louis alumni, the Marianists established a university to serve the educational needs of local <a>Hawai'i Catholics</a>.
They opened Saint Louis Junior College in 1955.
Upon becoming a four-year institution, the school changed its name to Chaminade College in 1957.
When graduate programs were added in 1977, Chaminade College changed its name to Chaminade University of Honolulu.</p>
<p>Chaminade operates the Wiegand Observatory, which opened in 2003.</p>
<p>The Nursing Program was approved by the Hawai'i State Board of Nursing in March 2010.
Named the Sallie Y. Miyawaki School of Nursing, Chaminade's four-year program will provide a contemporary curriculum characterized by sophisticated, simulated patient care experiences, informatics, genomics and cultural competency.</p>
<p>Chaminade University of Honolulu competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (<a>NCAA</a>) Division II as a member of the <a>Pacific West Conference</a>, a nine member athletic conference with members located in <a>Arizona</a>, <a>California</a>, <a>Hawaii</a>, <a>Utah</a>.
Chaminade University fields teams in basketball, cross country and golf for men and cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball for women.

Chaminade University of Honolulu's team name is the &quot;<a>Silverswords</a>,&quot; a reference to a Hawaiian plant prized for its beauty and ability to withstand harsh conditions.
<p>In 1982, Chaminade (led by Larry &quot;hook shot&quot; Larsen and his twin brother Lauren &quot;left-eye&quot; Larsen), then a member of the <a>NAIA</a>, defeated <a>Virginia</a> in what is considered the biggest upset in college basketball history.
Virginia, which featured <a>Ralph Sampson</a> and <a>Rick Carlisle</a>, was the top-ranked team in NCAA Division I basketball entering the game after posting victories against <a>Georgetown</a> (with <a>Patrick Ewing</a>) and <a>Phi Slama Jama</a> of <a>Houston</a>.
But in the <a>Blaisdell Arena</a>, the 3,500 fans in attendance &mdash; most of whom had come to see the nation's #1 team &mdash;  witnessed the historic 77&ndash;72 upset.
Chaminade was later defeated in the finals by <a>Olivet Nazarene University</a>.</p>
<p>Chaminade hosts the annual men's tournament, the <a>Maui Invitational Tournament</a>.
<p>:Light of truth by tropic sea, :Guide of youth, you keep us free.
:Lift our loyal spirits high, :With a sword of inspiration :Lead to battle with the cry, :&quot;Life in the word&quot; and victory :For love of God and nation.
:Rendezvous of West and East :Home of evening star, a gleam, :And morning star, pure silver beam, :Hail, splendor, echo of the sun.
:For love of God and nation.
