<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rhodes College traces its origin as a degree-granting institution to the <strong>Masonic University of Tennessee</strong>, founded in 1848 in <a>Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, by the Grand Masonic Lodge of Tennessee.
Since 1984, Rhodes has grown from a regionally recognized institution to a nationally ranked liberal arts college.
<p>Rhodes was featured in <a>Loren Pope's</a> <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em> and on the cover of the 2008 <a>Princeton Review</a> <em><a>Complete Book of Colleges</a></em>.
<p>The campus covers a  tract in <a>midtown Memphis</a> across from <a>Overton Park</a> and the <a>Memphis Zoo</a>.
Often cited for its beauty, the campus design is notable for its stone <a>Gothic architecture</a> buildings, thirteen of which are currently listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>The original buildings, including Palmer Hall (1925), Kennedy Hall (1925), and Robb and White dormitories (1925), were designed by <a>Henry Hibbs</a> in consultation with <a>Charles Klauder</a>, who designed many buildings at <a>Princeton University</a>, alma mater of college president Charles Diehl.</p>
<p>Later buildings were designed by <a>H.
Clinton Parrent</a>, a young associate of Hibbs who was present from the beginning.
Parrent's buildings include the Catherine Burrow Refectory (1957), which was an expansion of Hibbs' original dining hall.
The  bell tower was named in honor of <a>explorer</a> <a>Richard Halliburton</a>.
The latest example is the new Barret Library (2005), designed by the firm of Hanbury Evans Wright and Vlattas.</p>
<p>The campus was used as the setting of the movie <a>Making the Grade</a>.</p>
Some of the nearly 30 majors include <a>Economics</a> and <a>Business Administration</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>Political Science</a>, <a>English</a>, and <a>International Studies</a>.</p>
<p>Rhodes is one of 62 colleges recently classified for both &quot;Curricular Engagement&quot; and &quot;Outreach &amp; Partnerships&quot; in the &quot;Community Engagement&quot; category by <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>.
Approximately 80% of Rhodes students participate in some form of <a>community service</a> by the time they graduate.
The curriculum includes a requirement that students participate in activities that broaden the connection between classroom experiences and the outside world.
The <a>mission statement</a> of the college also reinforces community engagement, aspiring to &quot;graduate students with...a compassion for others and the ability to translate academic study and personal concern into effective leadership and action in their communities and the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the life of the college is its Honor Code, administered by students through the Honor Council.
Every student is required to sign the Code, which reads, <em>&quot;As a member of the Rhodes College community, I pledge my full and steadfast support to the Honor System and agree neither to lie, cheat, nor steal and to report any such violation that I may witness.&quot;</em>
<p><em>Rites of Spring</em> is a three day music festival in early April.
A major social event of the school year, it typically attracts several major bands from around the country.
Rhodes counts five national championships to its credit - one awarded to the 1961 baseball team, and four awarded to its <a>mock trial</a> team.
