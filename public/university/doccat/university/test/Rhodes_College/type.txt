<p>  <a>thumb|300 px|Buckman Hall</a> <strong>Rhodes College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, predominantly <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Memphis</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>, <a>USA</a>.
<p>About one third of Rhodes students go on to <a>graduate</a> or <a>professional school</a> soon after <a>graduation</a>.
The acceptance rates of Rhodes <a>alumni</a> to <a>law</a> and <a>business school</a>s are around 95%, and the acceptance rate to <a>medical school</a>s is nearly twice the national average.</p>
Because of this, students enjoy a relationship of trust with their professors and benefits such as taking closed book final exams in the privacy of their own rooms.
