established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding as Indiana Territory&#x2019;s University</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Vincennes University is the oldest university north of the <a>Ohio River</a> and west of the <a>Alleghenies</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This institution was founded in 1801 as <strong>Jefferson Academy</strong> and incorporated as Vincennes University on November 29, 1806.
established$$$@@@%%%Founded by <a>William Henry Harrison</a>, VU is one of only two U.S. colleges founded by a <a>President of the United States</a>; the other is the <a>University of Virginia</a>, founded by <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>.
mascot$$$@@@%%%For over two-hundred years, VU was historically the only <a>two-year university</a> in <a>Indiana</a>, although baccalaureate degrees in seven select areas are now available and were available prior to 1889.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Vincennes University, also known colloquially as Territorial University during the early 19th century, was the first and only land-grant public university established by the Indiana Territory, prior to the formation of the states of Indiana and Illinois.
established$$$@@@%%%The town of <a>Vincennes</a> was chosen as the location of both the capital of the Indiana Territory and of VU because Vincennes was centrally located at the approximate <a>population-density</a> center of the <a>Indiana Territory</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Upon the later formation of the <a>Illinois Territory</a> in 1809 as Indiana Territory prepared for statehood, Vincennes fell slightly east of the <a>State of Indiana</a>/<a>Illinois Territory</a> border.
established$$$@@@%%%As territorial policy progressed through the formation of the <a>Illinois Territory</a> in 1809 (which drastically reduced the size of the Indiana Territory that VU served), the formation of the <a>State of Indiana</a> in 1816 (which considered itself an entirely new and separate legal entity from Indiana Territory that created VU, where the State of Indiana had little or no financial responsibility for VU), and the formation of the <a>State of Illinois</a> in 1818&#x2014;, funding for Vincennes University became less and less certain with VU considered to be owned by the now-defunct Indiana Territory that was one legal step removed from the State of Indiana and two legal steps removed from the State of Illinois, immediately to VU&#x2019;s west.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Because of Vincennes&#x2019; status as the capital of the Indiana Territory complete with a federally-recognized territorial land-grant university, the Indiana territorial capital of Vincennes figured prominently in the early Indiana-Illinois territorial and statehood policy.
established$$$@@@%%%For example, the Tenth U.S. Congress established the Indiana-Illinois border, not with reference to a landmark along <a>Lake Michigan</a> near <a>Chicago</a>, but rather via direct reference to Vincennes, when that congress passed legislation establishing the separate <a>Indiana Territory</a> in preparation for Indiana&#x2019;s proposed statehood on February 3, 1809 [<a>http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/resources/docdivin.html</a>].
established$$$@@@%%%The Act established the boundaries as follows:   &#x201c;...all that part of the Indiana Territory which lies west of the Wabash river, and a direct line drawn from the said Wabash river and Post Vincennes, due north to the territorial line between the United States and Canada...&#x201d;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>State of Indiana&#x2019;s State University</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Further complicating the question of funding for VU was the State of Indiana's desire to establish its own state-controlled public university in <a>Bloomington, Indiana</a> as a separate institution than Territorial University.
established$$$@@@%%%Until the establishment of <a>Indiana University</a> as a state-controlled public university, Vincennes University, as a territory-controlled institution, was the sole <a>public</a> university within the whole territory of Indiana and then more narrowly within the state of Indiana.
established$$$@@@%%%The State of Indiana and the State of Illinois partially abandoned their financial responsibility for Territorial University once they desired to establish their own separate state-controlled public universities without the legal complications of an institution whose legal control perhaps spanned the borders of at least two states and was established by a then-defunct governmental entity: the Territory of Indiana.
established$$$@@@%%%These complications set the stage for <a>Trustees for Vincennes University v Indiana</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Conversely, these complications also set the stage for VU's rich two-century long history with some of the most architecturally-significant beautiful early 19th-century buildings to be found at any two-year institution in the <a>USA</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the mid-19th century, the Indiana state legislature tried to reclaim the original VU land grant, to be used for what would become <a>Indiana University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The resulting lawsuit (<a>Trustees for Vincennes University v Indiana</a>, 1853) ended up being heard by the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a>, who decided in VU's favor, based on its earlier decision in a similar case regarding <a>Dartmouth College</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The legal dispute arose in part because a portion of VU's <a>land-grant</a> <a>public university</a> status derives from the fact that VU is the inheritor of the land-grant and facilities of Territorial University.[<a>http://www2.westminster-mo.edu/wc_users/homepages/staff/brownr/IndianaCC.htm</a>]</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>To clarify the mission of VU <em>vis a vis</em> Indiana's other institutions of higher education at the time&#x2014;<a>Indiana University</a> and <a>Purdue University</a> and the <a>State Normal School</a>&#x2014;, the State of Indiana rechartered VU from a four-year university to a two-year university in 1889.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Tau Phi Delta and the Sigma Pi Fraternity</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1897, a small <a>literary society</a> called Tau Phi Delta (&#x03a4;&#x03a6;&#x0394;) was started at VU, which soon after became the founding (&quot;Alpha&quot;) chapter of <a>Sigma Pi</a> (&#x03a3;&#x03a0;) Fraternity, making that organization the first of its kind to be founded west of the <a>Ohio Valley</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A <a>clock tower</a> on the VU campus commemorates that event and the Fraternity, despite having grown into one of the largest collegiate fraternities and having relocated its headquarters to <a>Tennessee</a>, recognizes VU as its birthplace.
established$$$@@@%%%The VU chapter is still active today and counts among its members some of the University's most famous and successful alumni, including three VU Presidents.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Relationship with Ivy Tech Community College</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1999, Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon and Stan Jones, commissioner for higher education, convinced the Indiana state legislature to mandate a &quot;coordinated partnership&quot; between Vincennes University and what was then called Ivy Tech State College (1).
established$$$@@@%%%Writing for a national publication, reporter William Trombley characterized the &quot;shotgun marriage&quot; as something that was spoken of cautiously by officials at both institutions:  &quot;It was not our initiative,&quot; Vincennes President Phillip M. Summers said in an interview.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;We were asked if we would participate and we agreed&quot; (3).
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Thomas Cooke, dean of instruction at the Ivy Tech Indianapolis campus, said  &quot;We have everything except the liberal arts degree . . .
affiliation$$$@@@%%%And that could be easily accommodated within our present structure&quot; (4).

established$$$@@@%%%This tenuous arrangement dissolved during the 2005 rechartering of Ivy Tech State College as a statewide system of comprehensive community colleges named <a>Ivy Tech Community College</a>.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Athletics</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>VU is a member of the <a>NJCAA</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In honor of its heritage, the VU team moniker is the Trailblazers.
established$$$@@@%%%Trailblazers refers to the early years of Vincennes as outpost in the frontier of the <a>Northwest Territory</a> and its later period as capital of the <a>Indiana Territory</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%When the Trailblazers moniker needs to be personified by a mascot, VU depicts a Trailblazer as <a>minute man</a> or <a>woodsman</a>-type <a>frontier</a> <a>settler</a>, inspired by such as those as <a>George Rogers Clark</a> who resided in Indiana after his military career.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>VU Trailblazers compete in baseball, bowling, golf, basketball, cross country, tennis, volleyball, swimming &amp; diving, and track &amp; field.
