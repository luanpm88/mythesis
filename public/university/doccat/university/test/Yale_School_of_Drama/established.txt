<p>The <strong>Yale School of Drama</strong> is a <a>graduate</a> <a>professional school</a> of <a>Yale University</a> providing training in every discipline of the theatre: <a>acting</a>, design (<a>set design</a>, <a>costume design</a>, <a>lighting design</a>, <a>projection design</a>), <a>directing</a>, <a>dramaturgy</a> and <a>dramatic criticism</a>, <a>playwriting</a>, <a>stage management</a>, <a>sound design</a>, technical design and production, and theater management.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school traces its roots to the <a>Yale Dramatic Association</a>, the second-oldest college theatre association in the country, founded in 1900.
The &quot;<a>Dramat</a>&quot; produced the American premieres of <a>Albert Camus</a>'s <em>Caligula</em> and <a>Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a>Troilus and Cressida</a></em>, as well as original works by <a>Cole Porter</a>, <a>Stephen Vincent Benet</a>, and <a>Thornton Wilder</a> written when they were students.
This lively dramatic tradition led to the funding, in 1924, by Yale benefactor <a>Edward S. Harkness</a>, to establish the Department of Drama in the School of Fine Arts, and for the construction of the University Theatre, designed by <a>James Gamble Rogers</a>.
<a>George Pierce Baker</a>, a teacher of <a>playwriting</a>, was the first chairman of the department.
The first <a>Master of Fine Arts</a> in <a>drama</a> was granted in 1931.
In 1966, under Dean <a>Robert Brustein</a>, the <a>Yale Repertory Theatre</a> was formed to establish further ties between the professional and academic communities.
<a>Lloyd Richards</a>, dean and artistic director from 1979 to 1991, increased the theatre's emphasis on new plays, premiering works by <a>Athol Fugard</a>, <a>Lee Blessing</a>, and <a>August Wilson</a>.
Richards' successor as dean and artistic director, Stan Wojewodski, Jr. continued to emphasize the production of new plays, including several important works by <a>Suzan-Lori Parks</a> and <a>Theatre de la Jeune Lune</a>.
The current dean/artistic director, James Bundy, has produced notable premieres by <a>David Rabe</a>, <a>Jose Rivera</a>, and <a>Sarah Ruhl</a>, among others, as well as <a>Radio Golf</a>, the tenth play in <a>August Wilson</a>'s 20th century cycle.</p>
<p>Today, Yale Drama students work on School of Drama productions, at the Yale Repertory Theatre, and at the Yale Cabaret.</p>
<p>School of Drama students spend the morning in class, with the exact number of hours varying by their year in school and their department.
Many weeks throughout the school year, students attend two or even three productions a week produced by their colleagues, and some take the hour and forty minute train ride to New York City to see performances there.
Students also participate in athletic clubs, like soccer and volleyball, and mingle at events with their compatriots in the <a>Yale School of Art</a> and <a>Yale School of Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Drama offers a <a>Master of Fine Arts</a> in acting, design (with emphasis in sets, costume, lighting and projection), directing, dramaturgy and dramatic criticism, playwriting, stage management, sound design, technical design and production, and theatre management (with a joint M.F.A./<a>Master of Business Administration</a> available to management students in conjunction with the <a>Yale School of Management</a>).
A Certificate in Drama is available to those students who do not hold an undergraduate degree from an accredited college, but who are admitted and complete the same training as M.F.A. students.
The school also offers a <a>Doctor of Fine Arts</a> to students who hold an M.F.A. degree in Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism and have written a dissertation approved by the D.F.A. committee, and a Technical Internship Certificate to students who complete a one-year internship program of the Technical Design and Production department.</p>
<p>The mainstage season consists of six fully-supported productions, three directed by third-year directors as a culmination of their work at the school, and three written by third-year playwrights presented under the auspices of the Carlotta Festival of New Plays.

<p>Founded in 1968, the Yale Cabaret provides an extracurricular outlet for Yale School of Drama students, who produce passion projects and operate the theatre entirely on their own.
