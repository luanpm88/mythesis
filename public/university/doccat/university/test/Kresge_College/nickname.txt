<p>In the early days, Kresge had a threefold focus: <a>Humanistic psychology</a>, <a>Women's Studies</a> and <a>Environmental Studies</a>.
The earlier octets had significant open and communal spaces, but the ones designed later had more walls and individual rooms.
Today most of the apartments, suites, and sextets serve the same purpose as dorm rooms, although they contain private kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms.
Annual events include the Fall Film Festival and Halloween showings of <a>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a> with a live cast.
