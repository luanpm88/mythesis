<p>The <strong>Borough of Manhattan Community College</strong> (<strong>BMCC</strong>) is one of six <a>two-year college</a>s within the <a>City University of New York</a> (CUNY) system and the only one in <a>Manhattan</a>.
Founded in 1963, BMCC originally offered <a>business</a>-oriented and <a>liberal arts</a> degrees for those intending to enter the business world or transfer to a four-year college.
Its original <a>campus</a> was scattered all over <a>midtown Manhattan</a>, utilizing office space wherever available.
In the mid-1970s CUNY began scouting for suitable property on which to erect a new campus of its own.
It grants <a>associate's degree</a>s in a wide variety of vocational, business, health, science, and continuing education fields.
Go Anywhere,&quot; its student body is nearly two-thirds female and boasts a median age of 24 with attending students hailing from over 100 different countries, and a faculty of nearly 1,000 full-time and <a>adjunct professors</a>.
<p>Borough of Manhattan Community College is in the heart of <a>TriBeCa</a> and occasionally plays host to the <a>Tribeca Film Festival's</a> ceremonies and films.
The four main campuses rest between <a>New York City Hall</a> and the <a>Financial District</a>  near the <a>Hudson River</a> in <a>Downtown Manhattan</a>.
college's Fiterman Hall was heavily damaged from the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center]] on 9-11, and had to be demolished.]]
<strong>Fiterman Hall</strong> was a 15-story building on the campus of this college at 30 West Broadway in Lower Manhattan.
It opened in 1959 as an office building before owner Miles Fiterman, whom the building was named after, donated it to BMCC in 1993, which at the time was the largest private donation to a community college in U.S. history.
It was renovated in 2000 to receive new windows and infrastructure.
The building was owned by the State of New York Dormitory Authority.
<p>It was heavily damaged during the <a>September 11 attacks</a> in 2001, when debris from the collapse of 7 WTC compromised the structure.
It became unsafe to occupy due to mold growth and asbestos exposure.
Because traditional demolition would result in an unacceptable environmental impact, the building was scheduled for deconstruction and decontamination as part of the Lower Manhattan redevelopment project.</p>
<p>Fiterman Hall was to have been replaced by a new building designed by the architectural firm <a>Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners</a>.
Deconstruction was scheduled to be complete by February 2007; however, environmental impact concerns and funding issues caused numerous delays in completing the project.
The building was finally demolished in November 2009 after all asbestos had been removed.&lt;!--

<p>The college has won multiple awards from the CUNY system as well as other institutions for its ability to grant Associate's Degrees at an impressive rate and to foster continuing education at senior colleges.
With a respectable teacher-to-student ratio, significant public and private funding, and a central location in New York City, the learning experience has been covered by many publications and studied by experts.</p>
<p>However, BMCC also suffers from the same problems that plague all community colleges such as an alarming rise in remedial education , lack of freshman retention, and overcrowding.
Due to its larger base of capital compared to most other two-year colleges, expansion of new campuses during the rebuilding of Fiterman Hall was possible.
Improving the retention and graduation rate as well as the increased financial and academic burdens of a remedial program still remain a considerable problem.</p>
<p>BMCC offers a large state-of-the-art recreation facility including a regulation basketball court, <a>swimming pool</a>, and weight room.
