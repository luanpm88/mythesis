established$$$@@@%%%<p>  <strong>Nathaniel Eaton</strong> (1610 &ndash; 1674) was the first schoolmaster of <a>Harvard College</a> in <a>Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, and later became a clergyman.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Biography</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The sixth son of Rev. Richard Eaton (1565&ndash;1616) and Elizabeth Shepheard (1569&ndash;1636), Nathaniel was christened October 16, 1610, at the church of <a>St Giles</a> <a>Cripplegate</a>, <a>London, England</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He was educated at <a>Westminster School</a> and went on to <a>Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he was a contemporary and good friend of <a>John Harvard</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He later attended the <a>University of Franeker</a>, where he studied under <a>Rev.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%William Ames</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He emigrated to <a>New England</a> between 1634 and 1637 and became the first &quot;professor&quot; of the nascent <a>Harvard College</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He erected Harvard's first building, planted its first apple orchard, established the colony's first <a>printing press</a> in March 1639, and created its first semi-public library.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Around the time that Eaton started teaching at Harvard, an <em><a>Antinomian</a></em> controversy had erupted in the <a>Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The governor at the time, <a>John Winthrop</a>, was well-noted for his extreme stance within the <a>Puritan</a> community and was greatly feared by many of the colonists.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Even those who were Winthrop's close allies, such as <a>Rev.
established$$$@@@%%%Thomas Hooker</a>, who cofounded the <a>colony of Connecticut</a>, were repulsed by his personality.
established$$$@@@%%%As such, many left the colony and any Antinomians who didn't leave voluntarily were forced out, banished, or excommunicated (such as Rev. <a>John Wheelwright</a> who founded <a>Exeter, New Hampshire</a>, and his sister-in-law, <a>Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson</a>, who founded a new colony in what later became <a>Rhode Island</a>).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Eaton's older brother, <a>Gov.
established$$$@@@%%%Theophilus Eaton</a>, emigrated to the colonies at around the same time in 1637.
established$$$@@@%%%Deciding that he didn't want to be involved in the animosity, he &ndash; like Rev. Thomas Hooker before him &ndash; founded a new colony, the <a>colony of New Haven</a>, though Winthrop and others literally begged both of them to stay.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1639, the year after Theophilus left, Eaton was fired from his job following allegations that he had beat one of his students too harshly and that his wife had supposedly served students <a>hasty pudding</a> with goat dung in it.
established$$$@@@%%%Eaton's trial gave rise to the concept of <a>court reporter</a>s.
established$$$@@@%%%After the Church of Cambridge attempted an appeal on his behalf, Governor Winthrop refused them, saying that enough evidence had already been presented by several witnesses.
established$$$@@@%%%The church, however, was able to secure a promise that all subsequent trials would be accompanied by a recording of facts so that defendants and plaintiffs could refer to evidence already presented without witnesses having to go through the entire process again.
established$$$@@@%%%The only record of Eaton's own supposed &quot;confession&quot; was destroyed in a suspicious fire in the office of the famous historian, James Savage (1784&#x2013;1873), and his guilt remains in doubt.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Henry Dunster</a> succeeded Eaton in 1640 as Harvard's first <a>president</a>, and the first students graduated in 1642.
established$$$@@@%%%Interestingly, Dunster also found himself confronting the students, albeit in a sterner fashion, actually having to whip two of them publicly for abusing one of the citizens of Cambridge.
established$$$@@@%%%However, the students finally triumphed in the situation, and Dunster himself resigned in 1654 over disagreements with the church about <a>infant baptism</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At around the same time that Eaton was dismissed from Harvard, he apparently was also <a>excommunicated</a> from the congregation in Cambridge.
established$$$@@@%%%He moved to <a>Virginia</a> in 1640 and then sent for his wife and children, but according to Winthrop in his <em>History of New England</em>  (known to be full of inaccuracies), the ship in which they traveled disappeared without a trace.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the loss of his family, Eaton married the widow Anne (Graves) Cotton  (1620&ndash;1684), the daughter of <a>Captain Thomas Graves</a> (1584&ndash;1635) of Virginia and Massachusetts, and served for several years as an assistant to the <a>Anglican</a> curate at <a>Accomac, Virginia</a> before returning to England, where he was appointed the Vicar of <a>Bishop's Castle</a>, <a>Salop</a>, in 1661 and Rector of <a>Bideford</a>, <a>Devon</a>, in 1669.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1647 Eaton was finally &quot;exonerated&quot; of a &#x00a3;100 debt that Winthrop misstated as being for &#x00a3;1,000 in his <em>History of New England</em>, <em>ibid</em>, and with which Eaton had supposedly absconded to Virginia in 1640.
established$$$@@@%%%The exoneration is documented in Henry Dunster's record book for Harvard College as a copy of a letter by two benefactors that Dunster recorded directly underneath his first design of the <a>seal of Harvard College</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The 1640 <a>endowment</a> letter was footnoted in 1647 by Theophilus, who wrote: ::<em>this money was put wholey into the hands of my brother Nath:Eaton.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%9th August 1647.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%[signed] Theo:Eaton.</em></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Clearly, the intention of the footnote was to indicate that his brother had finally been repaid, and apparently Nathaniel had in part used the money to further his education as he did receive a <a>doctorate</a> (a <a>Ph.D.</a> and an <a>M.D.</a>) from the <a>University of Padua</a> in that same year.
established$$$@@@%%%As for the &#x00a3;100, Thomas Symonds &ndash; a carpenter who had apparently assisted in the building of the college at Cambridge in 1639 and afterwards &ndash; was soon found to be in debt to one of the <a>creditors</a> of the college, John Cogan, for exactly the same amount.
established$$$@@@%%%As stated  elsewhere, the college building itself was poorly erected &ndash; Symonds being the responsible party after Nathaniel left &ndash; and eventually Symonds and at least one of his assistants were thrown into <a>debtor's prison</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Religious Convictions</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Nathaniel Eaton's troubles seemed to mount, however, after he graduated from the <a>Jesuit</a> <a>Missionary</a> University; probably because the <a>Catholic</a> church was hated in the <a>New World</a> and he was considered <a>spiritually dead</a> by the Puritans.
established$$$@@@%%%Thus, he left for England around 1652, where he had already been accepted back by the <a>Church of England</a> and honored as both a vicar and rector (cf.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>supra</em>), though obviously he had his scruples, and was said to waver back and forth between devotions to his newly found home and that of his former, which he could never return to.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>In all likelihood, that &quot;back and forthedness&quot; and covering up set up a <a>scenario</a> of confusion, which seems to have also confused every recordkeeper involved.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Ironically, Eaton died in 1674 in <a>King's Bench Prison</a>, where he had been incarcerated for a similar debt: quite probably the same &#x00a3;100 debt from which he had already been given relief.
established$$$@@@%%%Also, his imprisonment coincided with the restoration of the <a>Stuart Throne</a>, and was likely reposted on an old list that <a>King Charles II's</a> father had kept concerning those of lingering or questionable indebtedness.&lt;!----&gt;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Another Nathaniel Eaton?</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>There is also evidence of another Nathaniel Eaton who lived in the town of <a>Boston</a> at the same time, across the street from Governor John Winthrop, but who spelled his name &quot;Heaton&quot;.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>His wife was also named Elizabeth, and there's some doubt whether the children that are listed in the colony's birth records at Boston are his children or Eaton's, since there are double listings for all of them spelling the name as &quot;Eaton&quot; and &quot;Heaton&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%Further complicating the situation was a mysterious fire that destroyed the Cambridge town records in 1643.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Further, as Eaton had graduated from Franeker in 1633, and the Revs.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>John Cotton</a> and  <a>Thomas Hooker</a>, and others, had all decided to leave for the colonies in the same year, it is quite probable that the Nathaniel Heaton who immigrated in 1634 with Revs.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Hutchinson</a> and Hooker is the very same Nathaniel Eaton that was the first professor of Harvard College.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%(Cf.
image_size$$$@@@%%%endnote 1, <em>infra</em>)</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Lastly, since Eaton had no place else to go, and no records are found of him in England or <a>Holland</a> after 1634, the evidence is strong that they are the same person.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%And possibly on the same ship with Nathaniel, the <em>Hector</em>, though there is no record of Nathaniel being on it, just that a Nathaniel Heaton emigrated in 1634 on another ship, the <em>Griffin</em> with <a>William Hutchinson</a> and his wife Anne [see <a>Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson</a>, <em>supra</em>], and on the very same ship on which the Rev. Thomas Hooker, the first pastor of the church at Cambridge, had emigrated a few months earlier.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>&lt;!-- 9.  Throughout Thomas Lechford's <em>Note Book, infra</em> are references to a suspicious &quot;floating&quot;, if you will&ndash;in a physical sense, &#x00a3;100 debt that a one John Cogan seems to be out of, who starts off by suing Nathaniel Eaton for it claiming an unpaid bill that his brother, Theophilus Eaton, would not make good on in August of 1639.
mascot$$$@@@%%%In the end, Cogan starts suing everybody for this &#x00a3;100, although he never actually states within court documents he was attempting to recuperate his money; and it becomes obvious that his habits are over-litigious and isn't just suing to recuperate money.
established$$$@@@%%%The above reference to exoneration comes from Nathaniel's brother, Theophilus Eaton himself, who wrote: &quot;this money was put wholey into the hands of my brother Nath:Eaton.

affiliations$$$@@@%%%[sig] Theo:Eaton.&quot; (ref.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>ibid</em>)Certainly the Governor, Theophilus Eaton, would not consider paying money back to his brother if it was him, and not John Cogan, whom he didn't trust.
established$$$@@@%%%He withheld the money from Cogan, not Nathaniel, and the effective &quot;exoneration&quot; comes from his hand written statement to that effect: &quot;I trust my brother Nathaniel with money, not John Cogan.&quot;
