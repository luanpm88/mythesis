<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|270px|right|Drawing of Cumberland University, c.1858</a>
The University was founded in 1842 by the <a>Cumberland Presbyterian Church</a> and received its Tennessee State charter the following year.
In 1852 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added a <a>law school</a>, the first in Tennessee and the first west of the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a>, and in 1854 a school of <a>theology</a>.
<p>The original building, designed by <a>William Strickland</a> in 1844, housed schools of art, law and theology.
On February 13, 2010, Cumberland University hosted a conference basketball game, and donated half of its gate admissions to Sherry&#x2019;s Run, a non-profit organization created to benefit people with <a>cancer</a>.
Also, the Cumberland University cycling team formed its own chapter of local non-profit organization <a>Ride for Reading</a>.</p>
<p><a>right|270px|thumb</a> Cumberland football began on October 26, 1894 with a 6-6 tie with Peaboby and finished that first year with a 2-1-1 season record.
The pinnacle of the early days of CU football was the 1903 season that began with a 6-0 win over Vanderbilt then a 6-0 loss to Sewanee and continued with a five day road trip that fished with victories over Tennessee (Medical)(86-0), Tulane (28-0), LSU (41-0), Alabama (44-0), and Grant of Chattanooga (92-0).
Cumberland would play a postseason game against Coach John Heisman's Clemson team on Thanksgiving Day that ended in a 11-11 tie and gave Coach A.L. Phillips and Cumberland University the Championship of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association.
That game was the first invitational post-season championship football game in the South.
Cumberland's baseball program is probably its best-known athletic team, especially those of the 2004 and 2010 <a>baseball</a> seasons, which won the World Series of the <a>NAIA</a>; the 2006 team was runner-up in this event.
The <a>football</a> team is a member of the <a>Mid-South Conference</a>.
