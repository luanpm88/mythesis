The school offers 38 majors as well as pre-professional degrees in engineering and accounting.
The university is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<p>Transylvania, meaning &quot;across the woods&quot; in <a>Latin</a>, is most commonly referred to as &quot;Transy.&quot;
The name stems from Transylvania University's initial founding, within the heavily-forested region of western Virginia known as the <a>Transylvania colony</a>, which became most of Kentucky in 1792.</p>
<p>While Transylvania does not take its name from the <a>Transylvania region</a> in central Romania, the college does use this unique naming connection in celebration.
Elements of <a>Dracula</a> can be seen on campus, predominantly in the week of Halloween during Rafinesque Week.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early years (1780-1865)</h3>
<p>Transylvania University opened in 1780, after the Virginia Assembly adopted a charter establishing <strong>Transylvania Seminary</strong>.
Originally in a log cabin in <a>Boyle County</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>, the school moved to Lexington in 1789.
After 1818, the university included a <a>medical school</a>, a <a>law school</a>, a <a>divinity school</a>, and a college of arts and sciences.</p>
<p>The other major institution that aided in the creation of the modern Transylvania University was Bacon College, named after <a>Sir Francis Bacon</a>, which would later be known as <strong>Kentucky University</strong>.  Bacon College existed from 1837&#x2013;1851, founded by the <a>Christian churches</a> in Kentucky.
Bacon College was a new entity separated from <a>Georgetown College</a>, a <a>Baptist</a> supported institution, but Bacon College inevitably closed due to lack of funding.
Seven years later, in 1858, Bacon College's charter was amended to establish Kentucky University, and moved to donated land in <a>Harrodsburg</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>In 1988, Transylvania University experienced an infringement on the institution's trademark when Hallmark Cards began selling Transylvania University T-shirts.
The product, developed for the 1988 Halloween season, was intended to be a novelty item purporting to be college wear from Count Dracula's fictional <em>alma mater</em>.
When contacted by the actual Transylvania University, Hallmark apologetically admitted that they were not aware of the Kentucky-based institution and recalled all unsold product immediately.
<p>The college is located on a 48-acre (19.4 hectare) campus about 4 blocks from downtown <a>Lexington</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.
The campus is divided in two by North Broadway, with the east side of Broadway containing the university&#x2019;s academic buildings, and the west side containing the majority of the residential buildings.
It contains a large concert hall, a small theater, a recital hall, the Morlan Gallery, the Rafskeller dining facility, the music technology classroom, and the Career Development Center .</p>
It primarily serves as a gallery for exhibiting contemporary art including Appalachian Folk art, Chinese art, contemporary African art, sculptural installations, and performance and video pieces.
The gallery offers guided tours and lectures for school groups, civic clubs, and senior citizen organizations .</p>
<p>Originally completed in 1952 with a dedication from <a>President Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, the building was renovated and had an addition added in 1985 with a re-dedication from then Vice President <a>George H. W. Bush</a>.
The Special Collections of the library houses a manuscript collection with letters, diaries, and documents of notable historical figures associated with the university including <a>Henry Clay</a>, <a>Jefferson Davis</a>, <a>Robert Peter</a>, <a>John Wesley Hunt</a>, <a>Daniel Drake</a>, and <a>Horace Holley</a>.
The rare books section houses a collection of books relating to the history of horses and natural history, as well as a collection of pre-1800 medical books .
<p>The newest residential building on campus, Thomson Hall was opened in the fall of 2008.
It serves as a residential building for upper-class students that meet a certain GPA requirement and features 31 suite style living-units which include study areas, living rooms, kitchenettes, bathrooms, and bedrooms.
The building is three stories tall, has 28,000 square feet of space, and cost $5.5 million.
Thomson Hall was built to be an environmentally friendly building and it exceeds state insulating value requirements by 28 percent.
It has geothermal heating and energy, low flow shower heads, a total energy recovery wheel on outside ventilation, fifty percent recycled material in the parking lot surface, and energy saving lighting.</p>
<p>Formerly located in the basement of Henry Clay Hall but moved to the ground floor of Thomson Hall in 2008, the 1780 Caf&#x00e9; offers students a place to eat after the campus dining center closes for the night.
<p>&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Old Morrison}}--&gt; Built in 1833 under the supervision of <a>Henry Clay</a> who was serving as Transylvania&#x2019;s law professor, Old Morrison is the main administration building for the university.
It is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and is featured on the city seal of Lexington.
During the <a>Civil War</a>, Old Morrison served as a hospital for Union and Confederate soldiers.
Old Morrison was gutted by fire in 1969 but was renovated and reopened in 1971.
The building also houses the tomb of <a>Constantine Rafinesque</a>, who was a natural science professor at the university from 1819 to 1826, and Sauveur Francois Bonfils, who taught at the university from 1842-49.
A native of <a>France</a>, he was apparently forced to flee due to political discord.</p>
<p>The Glenn Building was constructed as a multi-purpose building in 2005 and houses the campus bookstore, a coffee shop, and expansion space for the library.
It was named in honor of James F. Glenn, a Board of Trustees member who donated $1.1 million for its construction.
It utilizes an environmentally friendly geothermal heating and air conditioning system and several mature trees near the site were preserved during construction.</p>
<p>Transylvania has a thriving <a>Greek life</a> on campus, with four fraternities and four sororities on campus.
In its 2011 edition of &quot;The Best 373 Colleges&quot;, the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> named Transylvania number 1 on its list of colleges with &quot;A Major Frat or Sorority Scene&quot;  In 2010, the school was named number 1 in percentage of Greek students on campus.</p>

Known as Rafinesque Week in honor of the 19th-century botanist, inventor, and Transylvania professor <a>Constantine Rafinesque</a>, the college ends October with a unique combination of activities including ghost stories, a haunted house, a flag football tournament, and a lottery for four students to win the chance to spend the night in Rafinesque&#x2019;s tomb.</p>
<p>The weekend before classes start in the fall is known as Orientation Weekend.
They take part in community building exercises including a serenade of the first-year women by the first-year men on the steps of Old Morrison and a greet line, where every first-year student goes down the line and shakes hands with every other first-year student.</p>
<p>Just outside of the library, there stands a white ash tree estimated to be approximately 260 years old, 35 years older than the university itself.
In the 1940s and 1950s, the administration turned a blind eye to couples kissing in public here, at a time when it was frowned upon elsewhere on campus.
The romance of the site developed further as a tradition of couples kissing under the tree grew.
Today, with the rules on public displays of affection slackened, the tradition isn&#x2019;t as significant as it once was, but alumni from the 1940s and 1950s remember what the tree represented for them.
Students today still refer to the tree as the Kissing Tree.
In 2003 <em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> included the Kissing Tree among the most romantic places on college campuses in America and it was mentioned in a <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> article about romance on college campuses.</p>
