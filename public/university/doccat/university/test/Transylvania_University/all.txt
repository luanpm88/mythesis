established$$$@@@%%%<p>While Transylvania does not take its name from the <a>Transylvania region</a> in central Romania, the college does use this unique naming connection in celebration.

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early years (1780-1865)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Transylvania University opened in 1780, after the Virginia Assembly adopted a charter establishing <strong>Transylvania Seminary</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally in a log cabin in <a>Boyle County</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>, the school moved to Lexington in 1789.
established$$$@@@%%%After 1818, the university included a <a>medical school</a>, a <a>law school</a>, a <a>divinity school</a>, and a college of arts and sciences.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The other major institution that aided in the creation of the modern Transylvania University was Bacon College, named after <a>Sir Francis Bacon</a>, which would later be known as <strong>Kentucky University</strong>.  Bacon College existed from 1837&#x2013;1851, founded by the <a>Christian churches</a> in Kentucky.
established$$$@@@%%%Bacon College was a new entity separated from <a>Georgetown College</a>, a <a>Baptist</a> supported institution, but Bacon College inevitably closed due to lack of funding.
established$$$@@@%%%Seven years later, in 1858, Bacon College's charter was amended to establish Kentucky University, and moved to donated land in <a>Harrodsburg</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.</p>

city$$$@@@%%%<p>Thanks to Transylvania&#x2019;s unusual name and the on-campus tomb of two 19th-century professors, Halloween has become a week-long celebration at Transylvania.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Kissing Tree</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Just outside of the library, there stands a white ash tree estimated to be approximately 260 years old, 35 years older than the university itself.
established$$$@@@%%%In the 1940s and 1950s, the administration turned a blind eye to couples kissing in public here, at a time when it was frowned upon elsewhere on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The romance of the site developed further as a tradition of couples kissing under the tree grew.
established$$$@@@%%%Today, with the rules on public displays of affection slackened, the tradition isn&#x2019;t as significant as it once was, but alumni from the 1940s and 1950s remember what the tree represented for them.
established$$$@@@%%%Students today still refer to the tree as the Kissing Tree.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2003 <em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> included the Kissing Tree among the most romantic places on college campuses in America and it was mentioned in a <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> article about romance on college campuses.</p>
