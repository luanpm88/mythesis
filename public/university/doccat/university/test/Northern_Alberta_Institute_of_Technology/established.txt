<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1959, the Alberta provincial government decided to build an Edmonton facility to supplement apprenticeship and vocational training, which was at the time handled by the Provincial Institute of Technology (PITA) in Calgary.
The new institution would be named the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and PITA would be renamed the <a>Southern Alberta Institute of Technology</a> (SAIT).
Construction of the new facility began in January 1962.
The first class was enrolled in October, a group of 29 Communication Electrician apprentices.
NAIT officially opened on May 27, 1963, with a ceremony led by Premier Manning.
The first graduation ceremony happened in 1965, with a class of 326 graduates.
In 1982, the government transferred control to the new Board of Governors, chaired by Allan McCagherty.</p>
NAIT was presented this mascot in 1964 by the federal Department of Northern Affairs and Natural Resources, now <a>Indian and Northern Affairs Canada</a>.
