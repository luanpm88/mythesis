<p>The <strong>Asian Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>AIT</strong>) is an international institution for <a>higher education</a> in <a>engineering</a>, <a>advanced technologies</a>, and <a>management and planning</a>.
It &quot;promotes technological change and sustainable development&quot; in the Asia-Pacific region, through higher education, research and outreach.</p>
<h2>History, mission</h2>
<p>Founded in 1959 as <strong><a>SEATO</a> Graduate School of Engineering</strong> with a mission to develop highly qualified and committed professionals who will play a leading role in the sustainable development of the region and its integration into the <a>global economy</a>, it receives funding from organizations and governments around the world (initially from <a>SEATO</a> members).
<p>It is quoted as &quot;an excellent example of not only the initiative and organization of a technical university, but also of the success of a foreign aid program&quot;.
(See note presented at the <a>Asia Commons</a> conference, Bangkok, June 2006.)
<p>In 1989, AIT received a <a>Ramon Magsaysay Award</a> for Peace and International Understanding ''&quot;... for shaping a new generation of engineers and managers committed to Asia, in an atmosphere of academic excellence and regional camaraderie.&quot;''</pre>
The citation credited AIT and it said <em>&quot;Yu fell in love with nature early on, having been raised in Yunnan, a province of amazing beauty and home to three of the largest rivers in the world: Nu, Yangtze, and Mekong.
His interest in the environment was cultivated during a stint in the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, and was further deepened when he attended the <strong>Asian Institute of Technology</strong>, where he earned a master's degree in watershed management.&quot;</em></p>
<p>AIT has been granted the status of an International Intergovernmental organization by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Government of Thailand.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kingdom of Thailand, H.E. Mr. Kasit Piromya presided over the signing and adoption ceremony of the New AIT Charter on August 25, 2010.
<p>AIT operates as a self-contained international community at its campus located in Pathumthani, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of <a>Bangkok</a>, <a>Thailand</a>.
<p>AIT has a remote campus in <a>Vietnam</a> called AIT Center in Vietnam.
Asian Institute of Technology in Vietnam (AITCV) was established in 1993 under the MoA between The Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training and the AIT.
At that time AITCV was the first International Institution in Vietnam and the first center of AIT out of its headquarters in Thailand.
Other two centers have been authorized to be setup in <a>Indonesia</a> and <a>Pakistan</a>.
A campus map is available at the AIT website AIT was hosted by the Faculty of Engineering, <a>Chulalongkorn University</a>, <a>Thailand</a>, before it moved to its present campus in November 1973.</p>
<p>AIT consists of three schools, the AIT Extension, the AIT centre in Vietnam and the AIT centre in Indonesia.</p>

<p><a>thumb|Muhammad Yunus and Prof Said Irandoust</a> AIT has tied up with <a>Nobel</a> laureate <a>Muhammad Yunus</a> to create a <a>Yunus Center at AIT</a> with an objective &quot;to contribute to poverty alleviation by enabling rural people to handle and be in control of improving their own livelihoods&quot;.
The Center was launched on September 8, 2009..
According to the MOU, the Center will provide an independent and open platform for addressing issues in poverty alleviation in a way that has a direct impact on poor people&#x2019;s lives.
