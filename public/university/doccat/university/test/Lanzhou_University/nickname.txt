Parts of the campus are considered aesthetically pleasing, particularly in comparison to the rest of highly-industrialized Lanzhou, with a small park and man-made pond.
The lab has been highly developed on the basis of the authorization to confer bachelor, masters, doctorate and post-doctoral degrees through the financial aid of the World Bank loan.</p>
Mossbauer spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resource spin echo spectroscopy and general magnetic testing media are used to study magnetic materials&#x2019; microscopic structure and general magnetic behavior.
The laboratory is equipped with major facilities including a vibrating sample magnetometer, high pressure mossbauer spectroscope and magnetron sputtering system, along with many others.
