<h3>Laboratory of Arid Agroecology</h3>
<p>The laboratory was founded in 1991 under ratification of the Planning Commission of China and engaged in arid agriculture ecology research.
The Laboratory of Arid Agroecology is the only lab engaged in arid agriculture ecology research under the Chinese Ministry of Education.
<h3>Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry</h3>
<p>The Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry was one of the first state key laboratories ratified by Planning Commission of China.
It was founded in December 1987, open to visiting scholars and scientists from both within China and abroad.
The researches of the laboratory focus on organic molecular chemistry of special function, especially in the field of basic research on active organic molecules.</p>
<h3>Open Laboratory of Applied Magnetism</h3>
The lab is chiefly engaged in studies on applications of perpendicular magnetic recording.
The lab also serves as a key resource for research in materials science and condensed matter physics.</p>
<p>Financed by the first loan issued by the World Bank to develop universities, construction on this center began in 1982.
The center is primarily engaged in the determination and analysis of the structure of matter.
A testing service is available to the public.</p>
<p>Established by the State Technology Superintendency in 1992, it is the approved lab for the inspection of imported and exported chemical and mining products.</p>
