<p><strong>Marianopolis College</strong> is a private subsidized <a>college</a> in Montreal nestled against the side of <a>Mount Royal</a> in <a>Westmount, Quebec</a>, Canada.
It is one of the smallest anglophone colleges, with a student body of less than 2,000.
The College of General and Vocational Education is affiliated with the <a>ACCC</a>, and <a>CCAA</a>.</p>
<p>The college's current site is at 4873 Westmount Ave in Westmount, which is in between Vend&#x00f4;me and Villa-Maria metro stations.
<p>The CEGEP offers pre-university programs, which take two years to complete and cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada and introductory first-year university curriculum in preparation for a chosen field in university.
Accordingly, graduates may, in certain circumstances, receive advance credit of up to one full year in some disciplines when enrolling in universities outside the province of Quebec.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Marianopolis College at its previous C&#x00f4;te-des-Neiges location, prior to fall 2007</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|Marianopolis College at new location</a> The school was founded in 1908 by the Congr&#x00e9;gation des femmes vierges (<a>Congregation of sisters</a>) as the bilingual Notre Dame Ladies College, the first institution of higher learning for English-speaking Catholic women in Quebec.
Initially, it offered degrees through <a>Universit&#x00e9; Laval</a>, the first being offered three years after the college's founding.
The degree-granting agreement was later transferred to <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al</a>.
<p>During the World War II era, the English sector of the college was reorganized to be in line with <a>anglophone</a> universities, including programs in general science and honours chemistry.
It changed its name to Marianopolis College.</p>
<p>In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created.
Changes to the education system in Quebec caused Marianopolis to adopt a <a>CEGEP</a>-equivalent program in 1969.
The degree-granting program was eventually phased out in 1972.</p>
<p>The Marianopolis College athletes go by the name of the Blue Demons.</p>
