<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institution was established as the <strong>State College for Colored Students</strong>, on May 15, 1891, by the <a>Delaware General Assembly</a> under the provisions of the <a>Morrill Act of 1890</a> under which <a>land-grant colleges</a> for <a>blacks</a> came into existence in states maintaining separate educational facilities.
Through the conservative and practical planning of a board of trustees appointed by Governor <a>Robert J. Reynolds</a> of Delaware, the college was launched upon its mission of education and public service on February 2, 1892.
A Preparatory Department was established in 1893 for students who were not qualified to pursue a major course of study upon entrance.
A three-year <a>normal course</a> leading to a teacher's certificate was initiated in 1897.
The college graduated its first class of degree candidates in May 1898.
The normal course of study was extended to four years in 1911 and the bachelor of <a>pedagogy</a> degree was awarded to students on satisfactory completion of the curriculum.</p>
<p>In 1912, the courses of study were changed to academic, agricultural, <a>mechanic arts</a>, and <a>domestic science</a>.
The bachelor of pedagogy degree was awarded on creditable completion of the academic curriculum.
A certificate of graduation was granted on completion of the other courses of study.</p>
<p>In the 1916-1917 school year, the Preparatory Department was phased out, a Model Grade School was established, and a high-school diploma was granted on completion of a four-year course of study.
Four-year curricula in the arts and sciences, elementary education, <a>home economics</a>, agriculture, and <a>industrial arts</a> were established in 1932.
The college graduated the first class of bachelor-degree candidates completing one of these courses of study in June 1934.</p>
<p>In 1944, the college received provisional <a>accreditation</a> by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
<p>By legislative action, the name of the institution was changed to <strong>Delaware State College</strong> in 1947.
<p>In November 1949, the association revoked the accreditation of the institution.
This was a severe blow to the prestige of the college.
Strenuous efforts were exerted to maintain the existence of the college and to make it an accredited four-year, land-grant institution.
At the end of the 1951-1952 school year, the High School Division was discontinued.
In April 1957, the college was fully accredited by the association.
The association further reaffirmed the accreditation in 1962, 1972, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997.
Concurrently, the university achieved and maintained accreditation of its teacher education programs by the <a>Delaware State Board of Education</a>.&lt;!--the &quot;delaware state board of education&quot;?
<p>Since 1957, the institution has grown in stature as a center for teaching, research, and public service.
<p>On July 1, 1993, <a>Delaware Governor</a> <a>Tom Carper</a> approved <a>legislation</a> renaming Delaware State College to <strong>Delaware State University</strong>.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, the university anticipates enrollment to increase to over five thousand students continuing a growth pattern which saw enrollment increase from seven students when it opened to a high of thirty-five hundred in 1995.</p>
<p>   On September 21, 2007, two university students were shot on campus near Memorial Hall around one a.m.
One student was hospitalized in stable condition, and another student was hospitalized with injuries that were considered serious, according to a news release on the university's web site.
The campus was &quot;locked down&quot; with students confined to their dormitories and traffic blocked at the campus gate, through Sunday, September 23.
On that day, a freshman student was arrested for attempted murder in connection with the incident, and was <a>expelled</a> from the university.
The episode is significant because it marks the first test of a university's response to a campus shooting following the <a>Virginia Tech shootings</a> in April 2007.
<p>The  main campus in Dover is an approximate two-hour motor drive from <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>; <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>Maryland</a>; and <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, and three hours from <a>New York City</a>, <a>New York</a>.

<li>University Village complex</li>
<p>Two dining halls serve the more than 1,500 on-campus students.</p>
<p>As a part of the <a>Internet2</a> initiative, the university maintains several research computer laboratories including a high-performance computational cluster in its <a>DESAC</a> center.
Almost every building has a computer lab and each student has a dedicated data port for internet access, their own phone, a campus email address, and cable television access in all residence hall rooms.
<p> The university president is selected by the board of trustees and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management.
<p>Allen L. Sessoms served as president from 2003 until he resigned in August 2008 to take a position in Washington D.C., effective September 1, 2008.

<p>The university offers fifty-four undergraduate degrees, twenty-three graduate degrees, and five doctoral degrees (<a>interdisciplinary applied mathematics and mathematical physics</a>, <a>applied chemistry</a>, <a>neuroscience</a>, <a>optics</a>, and doctorate programs in education).
The school also offers several cooperative and dual degree programs.
Students receive instruction in classes with a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio.
It has an Honors Program, an Honors Curriculum, and a <a>Minority Access to Research Careers</a> (MARC) Honor's Program to increase the number of students in science interested in pursuing biomedical research and obtaining <a>doctor of philosophy</a> degrees in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, and <a>biopsychology</a>.</p>
<p>The graduating class of 2006 was the largest in the institution's history, consisting of over 500 seniors and graduate students.</p>
<p>The university has over twenty formal international partnerships with institutions in countries including <a>China</a>, <a>Cuba</a>, <a>Egypt</a>, <a>France</a>,  <a>Japan</a>, <a>Mexico</a>, <a>Nigeria</a> and <a>Serbia</a> which facilitate student exchanges and research and conference collaborations.</p>
<p>The institution has greatly increased its research endeavors over the past several years, as it has developed the research infrastructure needed to attract federal grants for projects in the following DSU Research Centers and in the sciences and mathematics: 1) Applied Mathematics Research Center, numerical analysis of <a>partial differential equations</a>, analytical methods in <a>solid mechanics</a>, <a>wavelet</a> analysis, <a>NURBS</a> methods of computer geometric design, <a>nonlinear PDE</a>s, <a>topology</a>;  2) The Center for Applied Optics, as well as The Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and Applications (CREOSA) (a <a>National Science Foundation</a>-Center for Research Excellence (NSF-CREST)), <a>optical science</a> and <a>laser physics</a> (including <a>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy</a>);  3) Center for Applied Optics for Space Science (CAOSS) (a <a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> University Research Center (NASA-URC)); 4) additional physics, including <a>mathematical physics</a>, <a>plasma physics</a>, <a>theoretical physics</a>, <a>fluid dynamics</a>, <a>high pressure</a> materials, <a>semiconductor</a> materials and devices, <a>geophysics</a>;  4) <a>Hydrogen storage</a> and <a>Fuel cell</a> Chemistry Center,  <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>organic chemistry</a>, <a>analytical chemistry</a>, <a>synthetic chemistry</a>, <a>NMR spectroscopy</a>, <a>electrochemistry</a>, <a>phospholipases</a>;  5) <a>IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence</a> (<a>NIH</a>-<a>INBRE</a>), <a>cell biology</a>, <a>microbiology</a>, molecular mechanisms of neuronal function, <a>neurobiology</a> and behavior, nanobioscience, <a>RNA sequencing</a>;  6) <a>biotechnology</a>;  7) Delaware Center for Scientific and Applied Computation, <a>computer science</a> and <a>bioinformatics</a>, <a>data mining</a> and <a>machine learning</a>, <a>combinatorics</a>, spatial-temporal <a>statistics</a>, <a>artificial neural networks</a>);  8) <a>neuroscience</a>; and 9) <a>environmental sciences</a>; among others.</p>
