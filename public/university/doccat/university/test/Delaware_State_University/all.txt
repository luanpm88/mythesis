established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The institution was established as the <strong>State College for Colored Students</strong>, on May 15, 1891, by the <a>Delaware General Assembly</a> under the provisions of the <a>Morrill Act of 1890</a> under which <a>land-grant colleges</a> for <a>blacks</a> came into existence in states maintaining separate educational facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%Through the conservative and practical planning of a board of trustees appointed by Governor <a>Robert J. Reynolds</a> of Delaware, the college was launched upon its mission of education and public service on February 2, 1892.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Five courses of study leading to a <a>bachelor's degree</a> were offered:  <a>agricultural</a>, <a>chemical</a>, <a>classical</a>, <a>engineering</a>, and <a>scientific</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A Preparatory Department was established in 1893 for students who were not qualified to pursue a major course of study upon entrance.
established$$$@@@%%%A three-year <a>normal course</a> leading to a teacher's certificate was initiated in 1897.
established$$$@@@%%%The college graduated its first class of degree candidates in May 1898.
established$$$@@@%%%The normal course of study was extended to four years in 1911 and the bachelor of <a>pedagogy</a> degree was awarded to students on satisfactory completion of the curriculum.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1912, the courses of study were changed to academic, agricultural, <a>mechanic arts</a>, and <a>domestic science</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The bachelor of pedagogy degree was awarded on creditable completion of the academic curriculum.
established$$$@@@%%%A certificate of graduation was granted on completion of the other courses of study.</p>
