established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the later part of the 19th century, thousands of Swedish immigrants left <a>Sweden</a> and began to settle in <a>America</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%As the communities, concentrated in the <a>Midwest</a> with hubs in Chicago and <a>Minneapolis</a>, began to settle and develop, many things began to happen that would pave the way for North Park University.
established$$$@@@%%%The denomination that is now known as the Covenant began to organize in the 1880s and soon the education of Swedish immigrants, specifically theological education, became an important issue.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<a>E.
established$$$@@@%%%August Skogsbergh</a> (1850-1939), sometimes called the Swedish Moody for his association with the famous Chicago <a>Evangelist</a> <a>D.L. Moody</a>, started a school in Minneapolis in 1884 that would serve as a forerunner to North Park in many ways.

type$$$@@@%%%<p>By 1891, the Covenant was in agreement that they should formally establish a school of their own.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Skogsbergh offered his school, which served as the official Covenant school for three years, from 1891 until 1893.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1894, the school was moved to Chicago, a move that upset some, including Skogsbergh.
established$$$@@@%%%It moved to its present location at the corner of Foster and Kedzie, despite its remoteness from the <a>Loop</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was sited close to then existing <a>Swedish-American villages</a> and the newly established <a>Swedish Covenant Hospital</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was erected and dedicated on June 16, 1894.
former_names$$$@@@%%%It is at this time that the name North Park was first used to describe the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The early years of North Park were marked with both struggles and successes.
established$$$@@@%%%Both enrollment and funding fluctuated greatly in the early years.
established$$$@@@%%%An interesting source of both money and headache came from P.H. Anderson, who at the time was serving as a Covenant <a>missionary</a> in <a>Alaska</a>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Taking part in the <a>gold rush</a> of the time, Anderson made a massive find.
established$$$@@@%%%And though he donated a portion of the findings, questionable circumstances surrounded the claim that created tension among the leadership of North Park.</p>

affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p>An early leader at that time was <a>David Nyvall</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He served as president and teacher in the <a>Seminary</a> for many years.
motto$$$@@@%%%The current seminary building, Nyvall Hall, is named after him.
established$$$@@@%%%By the turn of the century, North Park could boast of a theological seminary, a prominent and large commercial department, a growing music department, and an academy created in 1894 to better prepare students for the seminary.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Since the early days, the school has developed and changed in many ways.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1958, North Park Junior College expanded from a two-year college into a four-year program, becoming North Park College.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1997, the controversial decision was made to again change the name of the school, and North Park University was born.
established$$$@@@%%%Though North Park still holds on to its <a>Swedish American</a> past and close ties with the Evangelical Covenant Church, it is now a multicultural institution focused on diversity.
established$$$@@@%%%North Park now proudly describes itself as a <a>Liberal Arts</a> University that is intentionally <a>urban</a>, distinctively <a>Christian</a>, and purposefully multicultural.
