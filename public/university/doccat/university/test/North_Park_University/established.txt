<p><strong>North Park University</strong> is a four-year <a>university</a> located at 3225 W. Foster Avenue on the north side of <a>Chicago</a>, <a>Illinois</a> in the <a>North Park</a> neighborhood.
It was founded in 1891 by the <a>Evangelical Covenant Church</a> and shares its campus with the denomination's only <a>seminary</a>.
The university enrolls more than 3,000 students from around the country and the world and offers bachelors and masters degrees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the later part of the 19th century, thousands of Swedish immigrants left <a>Sweden</a> and began to settle in <a>America</a>.
As the communities, concentrated in the <a>Midwest</a> with hubs in Chicago and <a>Minneapolis</a>, began to settle and develop, many things began to happen that would pave the way for North Park University.
The denomination that is now known as the Covenant began to organize in the 1880s and soon the education of Swedish immigrants, specifically theological education, became an important issue.
August Skogsbergh</a> (1850-1939), sometimes called the Swedish Moody for his association with the famous Chicago <a>Evangelist</a> <a>D.L. Moody</a>, started a school in Minneapolis in 1884 that would serve as a forerunner to North Park in many ways.
In 1894, the school was moved to Chicago, a move that upset some, including Skogsbergh.
It moved to its present location at the corner of Foster and Kedzie, despite its remoteness from the <a>Loop</a>.
It was sited close to then existing <a>Swedish-American villages</a> and the newly established <a>Swedish Covenant Hospital</a>.
Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was erected and dedicated on June 16, 1894.
<p>The early years of North Park were marked with both struggles and successes.
Both enrollment and funding fluctuated greatly in the early years.
An interesting source of both money and headache came from P.H. Anderson, who at the time was serving as a Covenant <a>missionary</a> in <a>Alaska</a>.
And though he donated a portion of the findings, questionable circumstances surrounded the claim that created tension among the leadership of North Park.</p>

He served as president and teacher in the <a>Seminary</a> for many years.
By the turn of the century, North Park could boast of a theological seminary, a prominent and large commercial department, a growing music department, and an academy created in 1894 to better prepare students for the seminary.</p>
In 1958, North Park Junior College expanded from a two-year college into a four-year program, becoming North Park College.
In 1997, the controversial decision was made to again change the name of the school, and North Park University was born.
Though North Park still holds on to its <a>Swedish American</a> past and close ties with the Evangelical Covenant Church, it is now a multicultural institution focused on diversity.
North Park now proudly describes itself as a <a>Liberal Arts</a> University that is intentionally <a>urban</a>, distinctively <a>Christian</a>, and purposefully multicultural.

The teams compete in the <a>College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin</a>.
The men's soccer team has also fared better; in 2005, it successfully defended its <a>CCIW</a> conference title against rival <a>Wheaton</a>, earning their second title in as many years and North Park's first trip to the national tournament.
In 2010, after winning the CCIW conference title, the men's soccer team went on to win its first national tournament game in the schools history against Hope College.
North Park is also known as having one of the most successful men's basketball programs in all of college athletics.
Pitcher Mike Giovenco was drafted in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft by the <a>Minnesota Twins</a>, and was drafted again in 2010 by the Kansas City Royals in the 14th round.</p>

<p>One annual tradition is the <a>Santa Lucia</a> Festival, held each December in Anderson Chapel.
The service follows many <a>Swedish</a> traditions and is one of the few Santa Lucia Festivals held in the Chicago area.
