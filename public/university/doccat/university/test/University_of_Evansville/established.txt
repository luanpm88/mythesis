<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Evansville began in 1854 when Moores Hill Male and Female Collegiate Institute was founded by John Moore in the small town of Moores Hill in southeastern Indiana.
The first college building at Moores Hill, Moore Hall, was completed on December 1, 1856, although the opening day of classes for the new college were held in the unfinished building on <a>September 9</a>th.
The institution struggled financially during its time in Moores Hill, and a fire destroyed Moore Hall in 1915.
The institution continued to operate in a second building, Carnegie Hall, until the move to Evansville.
Carnegie Hall is now maintained as a museum.</p>
<p>On March 21, 1917, George S. Clifford made a presentation at a special session of the Indiana Conference of the <a>Methodist Church</a>.
He suggested moving the college to <a>Evansville, Indiana</a>.
After deliberation, the school was relocated to Evansville in 1919 and renamed Evansville College.
It operated in temporary quarters in downtown Evansville until Administration Hall (now Olmsted Hall) was completed in 1922.
<p>In the period from World War II to 1960, Evansville College grew significantly.
Also following the war, the Science and Engineering Building and Alumni Memorial Union were commissioned.
The Clifford Memorial Library was completed in 1957.
Five residence halls were built between 1958 and 1967, along with a fitness center, dining hall, and an art building.
In 1967, due to the institution's growth and organizational changes, the name was changed to the University of Evansville with the approval of the Indiana State General Assembly.
Also in 1967, a new theater building, Hyde Hall, housing Shanklin Theater was finished.</p>
<p>In 2010 The University of Evansville completed early its Endowment Campaign to raise $80 million after having raised an additional $60 million five years previous to the new campaign.</p>
<p>The university is known for its grassy open spaces and tree cover.
The university landscape is well maintained, and many students take advantage of the spacious lawns and large shade trees.</p>
<p>The campus is bounded on the north by the <a>Lloyd Expressway</a>, the south by Lincoln Avenue, west by Rotherwood Avenue, and on the east by Weinbach Avenue.
The oval was named in 2004 in commemoration of the university's 150th anniversary.
Most of the buildings follow an old limestone motif, and renovations generally emulate the rest of the building.</p>
<p>In the 2008-2009 Academic school year, the University of Evansville captured a title in the Concrete Canoe over perennial winners, the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</a>.
The ASCE chapter at UE has been increasing their placing in their region since 2004, steadily increasing in the ranks despite hard competition from renowned engineering schools like Purdue and UW&#x2013;Madison.</p>
