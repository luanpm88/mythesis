affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p> <strong>Adelphi University</strong> is a private, <a>nonsectarian</a> university located in <a>Garden City</a>, in <a>Nassau County, New York</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It is the oldest institution of higher education on <a>Long Island</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
principal$$$@@@%%%<h3>Adelphi College</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Adelphi University began with the Adelphi Academy, founded in <a>Brooklyn, New York</a> in 1863.
established$$$@@@%%%The academy was a preparatory school located at 412 Adelphi Street, in the <a>Fort Greene</a> neighborhood of Brooklyn, but later moved to the corner of Lafayette Avenue and Clifton Place, in <a>Clinton Hill</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was formally chartered in 1869 by the Board of Trustees of the City of Brooklyn for establishing &quot;a first class institution for the broadest and most thorough training, and to make its advantages as accessible as possible to the largest numbers of our population.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%One of the teachers at the Adelphi Academy was <a>Harlan Fiske Stone</a>, who later served as the <a>Chief Justice of the United States</a>.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1893, <a>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%Charles Herbert Levermore</a> was appointed as the head of Adelphi Academy.
established$$$@@@%%%Seeking to establish a liberal arts college for the City of Brooklyn, Levermore received a charter from the Board of Regents of the State of New York, officially establishing Adelphi College on June 24, 1896.
head_label$$$@@@%%%The college received its charter through the efforts of Timothy Woodruff, former Lieutenant Governor of New York and future first president of the Board of Trustees.
established$$$@@@%%%Adelphi was one of the first coeducational institutions to receive a charter from the State of New York.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time of its foundation, the college numbered only 57 students and 16 instructors.
established$$$@@@%%%The Adelphi Academy continued to exist as a separate, but nonetheless connected entity to the college.
established$$$@@@%%%The new college was located in a building behind the Adelphi Academy, on the corner of St. James's Place and Clifton Place, in Brooklyn.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1912, Adelphi became a college devoted exclusively to the education of women.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1922, the school raised over one million dollars to expand the overcrowded facilities in Brooklyn.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1925, Adelphi College severed its ties with the Adelphi Academy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1929, the college moved from its founding location in Brooklyn to the current location of its main campus in <a>Garden City, New York</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The original three buildings of the Garden City campus, Levermore Hall, Blodgett Hall, and Woodruff Hall, were designed by the famed architectural firm <a>McKim, Mead and White</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1938, the Dance Program was founded by the world famous dancer <a>Ruth St. Denis</a>; it was the first dance program ever established at an American college.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1943, the School of Nursing was established in response to the need for nurses due to American involvement in <a>World War II</a>; like the Dance Program, it was the first of its kind in the nation.
established$$$@@@%%%First Lady <a>Eleanor Roosevelt</a> presided over the opening of two federally funded residence halls on campus, in a speech entitled &quot;The Challenge of Nursing for Young Women Today.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1946, after World War II ended, Adelphi reverted back to a coeducational college and started admitting new students on the federal <a>GI Bill</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%New sports teams were created following the readmission of men to the school.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1952, the first program for clinical psychology was established at the school&#x2014;another first in the nation; it was also the forerunner to the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Adelphi University</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1963, the <a>New York State Board of Regents</a> granted the college university status, and the name was changed to Adelphi University.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1964, the School of Business was founded.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1966, the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies was founded.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1973, the University established ABLE (Adult Baccalaureate Learning Experience) for the education of adults.
established$$$@@@%%%Now known as University College, it was one of the earliest programs created for nontraditional students.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1984, the Institute for Teaching and Educational Studies was founded; it became the School of Education in 1990.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1993, the Society of Mentors was established, giving students faculty advisors that they could consult on an as-needed basis to assist them in their studies.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1995, the Honors College was founded.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Adelphi faced a serious scandal in 1996, as the school celebrated its 100th anniversary.
established$$$@@@%%%University president Peter Diamandopoulos and the Board  of Trustees were accused of neglect of duty, misconduct and failure to carry out the educational purposes of Adelphi.
established$$$@@@%%%The New York State Board of Regents was called in to investigate; Diamandopoulos, along with all but one of the Board of Trustees, was dismissed from office.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was in dire financial straits until the current president, Dr. <a>Robert A. Scott</a>, was installed in the position in 2000.
established$$$@@@%%%Scott saved the school by decreasing tuition, increasing scholarships offered for the students, and launching an advertising campaign to increase enrollment.
established$$$@@@%%%Since that time, the school has surpassed many of its previous gains, and is said to be undergoing a new renaissance.
established$$$@@@%%%Adelphi University has been ranked as a &quot;Best Buy&quot; college by the Fiske Guide to Colleges for the last four years for its quality education offered at a comparatively affordable price.
established$$$@@@%%%Adelphi University also participates in the <a>National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a> (<a>NAICU</a>)'s <a>University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN)</a>.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<h2>Breast cancer support program</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university's School of Social Work is home to the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program, which marks its 30th anniversary in 2010.
established$$$@@@%%%The program began in 1980 as the Woman-to-Woman Hotline, a free and confidential service to help women with breast cancer.

closed$$$@@@%%%<h3>School seal</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first school seal was developed with the foundation of the Adelphi Academy in 1869.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Essentially, it was the current seal with several differences.
state$$$@@@%%%First, the legend read &quot;Adelphi Academy&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn, New York&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%Second, the letters in the emblem were &quot;AA&quot;.
motto$$$@@@%%%Third, the eventual school motto, &quot;The Truth Shall Make Us Free&quot; did not appear.
established$$$@@@%%%The motto was introduced in the second seal with the foundation of the college in 1896.
established$$$@@@%%%At this time, the legend was changed to read &quot;Adelphi College&quot;, the letters &quot;AA&quot; were changed to &quot;AC&quot;, and the new date of foundation was introduced.
established$$$@@@%%%The third seal removed the year 1869 from the emblem, reflecting the separation of the Academy and the college in 1925.
established$$$@@@%%%The fourth seal was introduced in 1930 and changed the legend &quot;Brooklyn, New York&quot; to &quot;Garden City, New York&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The fifth and current seal was introduced in 1963, reflecting the school's University status.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The legend now reads &quot;Adelphi University&quot; and the letters are &quot;AU&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The inscription <em>Vita sine litteris mors est</em>, meaning &quot;Life without learning is death&quot;, appears on all variations of the school seal.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Many of the buildings on the Garden City campus are symmetrical in nature.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This is likely because <a>garden cities</a> are typically planned symmetrically.
