<p>   The <strong>University of Minnesota Duluth</strong> (<strong>UMD</strong>) is a regional branch of the <a>University of Minnesota system</a> located in <a>Duluth, Minnesota</a>, <a>USA</a>.

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Darland Administration Building</a> Although the University of Minnesota Duluth didn&#x2019;t officially make its appearance until 1947, plans to make a strong college in the Duluth area started in the 1800s.
The state legislature made blueprints and gathered supplies to build a teaching school for women and in 1895 they announced the starting of the <strong>Duluth Normal School</strong>.
In 1896, the City of Duluth donated  of land to serve as a foundation for the Duluth Normal School, and the state legislature donated an additional $5,000 to build the school.
The main building of the Duluth Normal School cost a total of $75,000 but these funds were not available until 1900.
In February 1901, a large fire caused extensive damage to the school leaving only a couple of walls and doorways standing.
In 1902, the school opened for business.
Women came to the school to be trained for a highly sought-after degree in education.
By 1903, seven women received their diplomas from Duluth Normal School.
In 1906, the first ladies dormitories were established and opened, costing the school around $35,000 to build.
Living on campus was much cheaper and much easier for everyone.
Throughout the next few years, more dormitories, two new wings, and an auditorium were added to the school.
By the time these additions were finished, tuition was increased and requirements, such as having a high school diploma, were put in place in order to apply to the school.</p>
Shortly after the renaming, bachelor&#x2019;s degrees and four-year degree programs were added to the school.
All of these generated money for the school, and attracted many more students to the school over the years.
By 1937, people were fighting to make DSTC a University of Minnesota branch to increase funding and the overall reputation of the school.
It was not until 1947 the DSTC became part of the University of Minnesota system and was again renamed, this time to the University of Minnesota Duluth, or UMD.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Solon Campus Center</a> Today, the UMD campus consists of more than 50 buildings on 244 acres (98.7 hectares) overlooking <a>Lake Superior</a>.
<p>UMD has experienced a revamping of student amenities and subsidized research facilities over the past seven years, beginning in 2000 with the completion of a new <a>library</a>.
A little over 1% of the library's $28 million construction costs went toward the purchase and installation of a glass sculpture by <a>Dale Chihuly</a> that hangs from the ceiling of the two-story library lobby.
2005 saw the completion of the Swenson Science Building, a new student dining facility and a revamped UMD themed gift shop as well as the replacement of the famed coffee cart with the Northern Shores Coffee Shop.
An  high outdoor <a>sculpture</a> adjacent to the Swenson Science Building makes reference to elements of Duluth's surrounding native American <a>Ojibwe</a> culture.
The sculpture was designed by <a>John David Mooney</a> and is called &quot;Wild Ricing Moon,&quot; and represents the traditional <a>wild rice</a> harvest.
&quot;Wild Ricing Moon&quot; was completed on June 2, 2006.</p>
<p>The University of Minnesota has a graduate program in physics which offers only a Master's degree.</p>
<li>College of Pharmacy</li>
<p>The Weber Music hall, built in 2002 and designed by architect <a>C&#x00e9;sar Pelli</a>, is considered the &quot;gem&quot; of UMD.
The state of the art hall has amazing acoustics and can seat 350 people.</p>
<p>In the 1920s and early 1930s, George P. Tweed and his wife Alice began collecting European and American paintings from the 19th and early 20th century.
After Mr. Tweed's death in 1946, Mrs. Tweed saw the potential educational resource that her husband's collection possessed for the community.
In 1958 she helped fund what is today the University of Minnesota Duluth's Tweed Museum of Art.
<p>The Marshall W. Alworth <a>Planetarium</a> was built by Marshall W. Alworth, a benefactor to the school for many years.
Marshall grew up in Duluth and attended <a>Duluth Central High School</a> and later <a>Dartmouth College</a>.
<p>The Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium has a  dome and a Spitz A3P star machine.
The school competes at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> level in the <a>Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference</a> (NSIC) in all sports except <a>ice hockey</a>.
Both the men's and women's hockey programs compete in the Division I <a>Western Collegiate Hockey Association</a>.
Sororities include <a>Gamma Sigma Sigma</a>, <a>Beta Lambda Psi</a>, <a>Phi Sigma Sigma</a>, and <a>Kappa Beta Gamma</a>.
Students must be an active member of a fraternity or sorority in good standing before serving on Greek Council.The organizations have recently made a great comeback in enrollment since falling off in the 1990s.
The council had financial misappropriation issues leading to the departure of <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> in the fall of 2009.
Alpha Phi Omega disagreed with the council and decided to retract its membership due to disagreements with the direction of governance.

<p><a>thumb|right|The new Swenson Science Building at UMD.</a> James Swenson, a University of Minnesota Duluth Alumnus, has donated more than $21 million to the school, with his most recent donation of $10.7 million toward the College of Science and Engineering.
Since the program began, UMD has awarded scholarships to over 200 students, and had another 160 Swenson scholar students graduate.
Because of his generous donations over the years, the school has renamed the College of Science and Engineering to be the Swenson College of Science and Engineering.
The Swenson&#x2019;s are natives of northern Superior, and have since relocated to California after James completed his bachelor&#x2019;s degree in chemistry in 1959 at UMD.
He then made millions in the computer industry with his circuit shop Details Inc., which he sold in 1997.</p>
