established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Darland Administration Building</a> Although the University of Minnesota Duluth didn&#x2019;t officially make its appearance until 1947, plans to make a strong college in the Duluth area started in the 1800s.
established$$$@@@%%%The state legislature made blueprints and gathered supplies to build a teaching school for women and in 1895 they announced the starting of the <strong>Duluth Normal School</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1896, the City of Duluth donated  of land to serve as a foundation for the Duluth Normal School, and the state legislature donated an additional $5,000 to build the school.
established$$$@@@%%%The main building of the Duluth Normal School cost a total of $75,000 but these funds were not available until 1900.
established$$$@@@%%%In February 1901, a large fire caused extensive damage to the school leaving only a couple of walls and doorways standing.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Although money had been lost in the creation of the Duluth Normal School, the legislature decided to rebuild.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>After the school had been rebuilt, many new additions were made, including new faculty and a new president.
president$$$@@@%%%In April 1901, Eugene W. Bohannon was appointed president of the Duluth Normal School.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1902, the school opened for business.
established$$$@@@%%%Women came to the school to be trained for a highly sought-after degree in education.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1903, seven women received their diplomas from Duluth Normal School.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1906, the first ladies dormitories were established and opened, costing the school around $35,000 to build.
established$$$@@@%%%Living on campus was much cheaper and much easier for everyone.
established$$$@@@%%%Throughout the next few years, more dormitories, two new wings, and an auditorium were added to the school.
established$$$@@@%%%By the time these additions were finished, tuition was increased and requirements, such as having a high school diploma, were put in place in order to apply to the school.</p>
former_names$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1921, the Duluth Normal School was renamed to the <strong>Duluth State Teachers College</strong>, also known as DSTC.
established$$$@@@%%%Shortly after the renaming, bachelor&#x2019;s degrees and four-year degree programs were added to the school.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In 1929 men began to come to the DSTC, and along with them, the first sports teams including hockey, football, and basketball.
established$$$@@@%%%All of these generated money for the school, and attracted many more students to the school over the years.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1937, people were fighting to make DSTC a University of Minnesota branch to increase funding and the overall reputation of the school.
established$$$@@@%%%It was not until 1947 the DSTC became part of the University of Minnesota system and was again renamed, this time to the University of Minnesota Duluth, or UMD.</p>

free_label$$$@@@%%%Additional buildings built since 2000 include the Weber Music Hall, Swenson Science Building, Sports and Health Center addition, and the new Labovitz School of Business.
free_label$$$@@@%%%With the construction of these new buildings comes a plethora of new art on campus.
type$$$@@@%%%All new public building projects in Minnesota must comply with the state's &#x201c;One Percent for Art&#x201d; law, passed by the <a>State Legislature</a> in 1984, which mandates that all such projects in Minnesota costing over $500,000 must devote at least 1% of their total construction budget towards incorporating <a>public art</a> into these building's public spaces.
established$$$@@@%%%A little over 1% of the library's $28 million construction costs went toward the purchase and installation of a glass sculpture by <a>Dale Chihuly</a> that hangs from the ceiling of the two-story library lobby.
established$$$@@@%%%2005 saw the completion of the Swenson Science Building, a new student dining facility and a revamped UMD themed gift shop as well as the replacement of the famed coffee cart with the Northern Shores Coffee Shop.
established$$$@@@%%%An  high outdoor <a>sculpture</a> adjacent to the Swenson Science Building makes reference to elements of Duluth's surrounding native American <a>Ojibwe</a> culture.
established$$$@@@%%%The sculpture was designed by <a>John David Mooney</a> and is called &quot;Wild Ricing Moon,&quot; and represents the traditional <a>wild rice</a> harvest.
