closed$$$@@@%%%<h2>School songs</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>school song</a>s, &quot;The Marquette University Anthem&quot; and the &quot;Marquette University Fight Song,&quot; are generally sung by students and alumni during basketball games, accompanied by the <a>pep band</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%However, the former is often played using the <a>carillon</a> bells of the Marquette Hall <a>bell tower</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;The Marquette University Anthem,&quot; as it was originally known, is now referred to almost exclusively as &quot;Hail Alma Mater.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The tune was written by Liborius Semmann, a music teacher from Wisconsin.
established$$$@@@%%%The Fight Song is more commonly referred to as &quot;Ring Out Ahoya,&quot; although the actual meaning of the word &quot;Ahoya&quot; is open to a great deal of debate.
established$$$@@@%%%One leading theory is that the call of &quot;Ahoya&quot; was often made by sailors on the <a>Potomac river</a> while passing <a>Georgetown University</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, hence Georgetown getting its nickname of &quot;Hoyas.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The cheer was then relayed from priests and professors moving between the two Jesuit universities.
