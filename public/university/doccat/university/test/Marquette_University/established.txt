Founded by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in 1881, the school is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>.
The university is accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a> and currently has a student body of 11,600.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Father Jacques Marquette exploring</a> Marquette University was founded on August 28, 1881 as Marquette College by <a>John Martin Henni</a>, the first Catholic bishop of the <a>Archdiocese of Milwaukee</a>.
The highest priority of the newly established college was to provide an affordable Catholic education to the area's emerging <a>German</a> immigrant population.
Marquette College officially became a university in 1907.
<a>Marquette University High School</a>, formerly the preparatory department of the university, became a separate institution the same year.
Initially an all-male institution, Marquette University became the first coed Catholic university in the world, when it admitted its first female students in 1909.</p>
<p>Marquette University acquired the Wisconsin College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1913, and opened schools of medicine (including nursing), dentistry, and pharmacy.
Marquette's School of Medicine separated from Marquette in 1967 to become the <a>Medical College of Wisconsin</a>.</p>
On December 18, 2006, President <a>Rev.
Less than five months later, on May 4, 2007, Marquette announced a $51 million gift from Raymond and Kathryn Eckstein that will directly benefit the Marquette University School of Law.
<p>Marquette is located on a  <a>campus</a> in the near downtown Milwaukee <a>neighborhood</a> of <a>University Hill</a>, on the former Wisconsin State Fairgrounds.
<a>Lake Michigan</a> is roughly one mile east of the edge of campus.
The campus encompasses 9th Street on the east, to 20th Street on the west, and from Wells Street on the north, to Clybourn Street on the south.
Named after the university, the <a>Marquette Interchange</a> is also close to campus.</p>
The five-story brick building, completed in 1990, contains a ballroom for 800 guests, offices for student organizations, a coffee shop called &quot;Brew Bayou&quot;, the university's information center, a <a>post office</a>, a branch <a>US Bank</a>, a game room, a cafeteria, and the campus gift shop.
An adjacent auditorium is connected to the AMU by a covered promenade.
Also part of the AMU is the Chapel of the Holy Family, which holds a student Mass each Sunday night.</li>
<li><a>Gesu Church</a>, completed in 1894, is considered the spiritual center of the campus, but is not affiliated with the university.
The Jesuit parish was designed by <a>architect</a> <a>Henry C. Koch</a> in the <a>Gothic art</a> style.
Student-organized Masses are held each Sunday in Gesu Church, along with the annual Mass of the Holy Spirit, a traditional celebration at many Jesuit education institutions to begin the school year.</li>
<li>The <a>Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art</a> features more than 8,000 works from the old masters to <a>contemporary art</a> works from such artists as <a>Salvador Dal&#x00ed;</a>, <a>Marc Chagall</a>, <a>Keith Haring</a> and <a>Roberto Matta</a>.</li>
In addition to classrooms and faculty offices, the law school has a four-story &quot;library without borders,&quot; two mock court rooms, a cafeteria, a workout facility, a conference center, and a small parking structure.</li>
<li>Sensenbrenner Hall previously housed the <a>law school</a>.
One of the oldest buildings on campus, it is known for its stained-glass windows and traditional design, especially in the Howard B. Eisenberg Memorial Hall.
Marquette's law library, which featured contrasting modern architecture, was located next to Sensenbrenner Hall.
<li>Robert A. Johnston Hall houses the J. William &amp; Mary Diederich College of Communications.
Built at the turn of the 20th century, the fledgling Marquette College almost went <a>bankrupt</a> to build this until Robert A. Johnston, a local <a>confectioner</a>, donated just over $100,000 to save the project.
For a short while, Johnston Hall housed the entire College, including the Jesuit faculty.
The now ivy-covered building once featured an <a>observatory</a> for <a>astronomy</a> students.
<li>Marquette Hall, built in 1924, is the four-story building that originally served as Marquette's Science Building with offices, classrooms and labs.
In 1976, it was renamed Marquette Hall in honor of the University's namesake.
One of the most widely-recognized buildings on campus, Marquette Hall was the home to several offices, including Undergraduate Admissions until they moved to their new location in the newly completed Zilber Hall.
<li><a>Marquette School of Dentistry</a> building houses Wisconsin's only dental school.
Completed in 2002, the building holds pre-clinical labs, classrooms, and a community dental clinic.</li>
<li>The <a>Al McGuire Center</a>, named for the legendary Marquette basketball coach, was opened in 2004 and is home to the women's volleyball and basketball teams and serves as the practice facility and administrative offices for the men's basketball team.</li>
The library contains many of <a>J.

Joan of Arc Chapel</a> is the only medieval chapel in the <a>Western Hemisphere</a>.
Originally built in France in the 15th century, the Chapel was donated to the university by Mr. and Mrs. Marc Rojtman in 1964.
The building was relocated to the U.S., first to New York, then to Milwaukee, where it was reconstructed piece by piece in 1966.
<li>Valley Fields, used for men's and women's soccer, men's and women's track and field, and club athletics, is located across the <a>Menomonee River</a> in the <a>Menomonee Valley</a>, just south of the main campus.
It stands on the former site of the 1212 Building and Parent's Park and spans the entire 1200 block of West Wisconsin Avenue.
Completed in late fall 2009, Zilber Hall houses the Office of Student Financial Aid, the Office of the Bursar, the Office of the Registrar, and the Office of Admissions.</li>

<p>Marquette's 11,500 students come from all 50 <a>states</a>, various <a>U.S. territories</a>, and represent more than 80 <a>countries</a>.
<p>The majority of Marquette's students hail from the <a>Midwestern United States</a>, generally from the <a>metropolitan area</a>s surrounding <a>Chicago</a>, Milwaukee, <a>Madison</a>, <a>Minneapolis</a>, <a>Detroit</a>, and <a>St.
The retention rate for Marquette is high, with about 90% of students returning for their <a>sophomore</a> year.</p>
<p>Marquette administers an Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), a federally funded TRIO program that is intended to motivate and enable low-income and first generation students, whose parents do not have a baccalaureate degree, to enter and succeed in higher education.
<p>Throughout the years, Marquette has absorbed many existing buildings in the area, especially for use as <a>residence halls</a>.
Some examples of absorbed buildings include Charles Cobeen Hall, a former hotel, and M. Carpenter Tower, an <a>Art Deco</a> building, both constructed in the 1920s on 11th Street that have been converted into undergraduate residence halls.
Glenn Humphrey Hall, a student apartment complex that was once the <a>Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Wisconsin</a>, and David Straz Tower, which was formerly the Downtown Milwaukee <a>YMCA</a>, and is now a residence hall, recreation center and administrative office building.
Mashuda Hall, a sophomore <a>dorm</a>, was once the Coach House Motor Inn where <a>The Beatles</a> stayed during their tour in 1964.
It was converted into a <a>freshman</a> residence hall for the 2005-2006 academic year.
The university also purchased the Marquette Apartments complex in 2008, and it was remodeled as a sophomore residence hall, renamed McCabe Hall, for the 2009-2010 academic year.</p>
Marquette is a <a>Division I</a> member of the <a>NCAA</a> and competes in the <a>Big East Conference</a>.
Football was discontinued by the university after the 1960 season for financial reasons.
Since joining the Big East in 2005, the only conference championship won by the Golden Eagles was in 2008 by the men's golf team.
<p>In 1962, Marquette was the first college in the U. S. to sign a Hispanic to play basketball on the college level.
In 2009, because of Marquette, Milwaukee was named by <a>CNN</a> as one of America's great college basketball towns.</p>
In 2004, Marquette began to consider changing the name back to Warriors, and conducted a <a>poll</a> that showed 92 percent of alumni and 62 percent of students &quot;identified&quot; with that nickname.
However, the <a>Board of Trustees</a> ignored the results of the poll on the grounds that previous logos had been <a>disrespectful</a> to <a>Native Americans</a>, and changed the nickname to simply &quot;Gold&quot;.
Respondents were told in advance that write-in votes for &quot;Warriors&quot; would not be tabulated, although those results were later released, and &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; was restored in June 2006.</p>
<p>The university has more than 230 student organizations in various fields of interest:</p>
<li><a>Alpha Sigma Nu</a>, an international Jesuit honor society, founded at Marquette in 1915.</li>

<li><a>Delta Xi Phi</a>, a sorority dedicated to multicultural awareness</li>
<li><a>Sigma Lambda Gamma</a>, a historically <a>Latina</a>-based sorority.
MUSG was formerly known as the Associated Students of Marquette University (ASMU).</li>
<li>The Marquette University Players Society (MUPS for short), a platform for student-produced theater.</li>
<li>Vocal Groups: The <a>Marquette University Chorus</a>; the longest standing choral organization on campus, is a mixed choir of fifty to sixty men and women who share their time, talents, and passion for music with others at Marquette and throughout the community.
The Naturals combine with the the Marquette Chorus and Liturgical Choir, to sing at Christmas time for the annual <a>Nine Lessons and Carols</a> concert held in <a>Gesu Church</a>.</li>
<li>The Marquette University <a>Orchestra</a> provides members with an opportunity to develop and share musical talents through participation in a large-group setting.</li>
The <a>Symphonic Band</a> is a group designed for students who wish to continue to make music at the collegiate level, but in a relaxed setting.
There is also the newly established <a>Wind Ensemble</a>, a band which performs high-level wind band repertoire.
Although open to all students in band, the pep band splits mainly into two core bands, Blue and Gold, which consist of 29 students each.
<li>All instrumental groups, as well as the <a>Marquette University Chorus</a>, offer 0 or 1 credit per semester.
It is published in print on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the school year.
The paper has won dozens of regional and national awards for excellence from the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a>.
<li>In the Spring of 2005, a group of students formed <em> The Warrior</em>, an independent conservative newspaper, named for Marquette's former nickname.</li>
<li><a>Marquette Radio</a> and <a>MUTV</a>, the student <a>radio</a> and <a>television stations</a>, were launched in the late-1960s to mid-1970s.
<li>A quarterly student produced magazine, the <em><a>Marquette Journal</a></em>, focuses on student life, though formerly the <em>Journal</em> was the school's student literary magazine.
In 2004, the magazine was a runner up for the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> &quot;Mark of Excellence&quot; award for Best Student Magazine Published More than Once a Year.</li>
<li><em>Hilltop</em> was Marquette's university-wide <a>yearbook</a> from 1915 to 1999.
The publication, in its 84 years of existence, totaled over 30,000 pages in 82 volumes.
In April 2006, Marquette's <a>librarians</a> completed a digitally-archived collection of <em>Hilltop</em>.</li>
Students on campus use services provided by the two organizations, including the LIMO program, an entirely student staffed transportation service, which is the first of its kind in the country.</li>
<p>The <a>school song</a>s, &quot;The Marquette University Anthem&quot; and the &quot;Marquette University Fight Song,&quot; are generally sung by students and alumni during basketball games, accompanied by the <a>pep band</a>.
However, the former is often played using the <a>carillon</a> bells of the Marquette Hall <a>bell tower</a>.
&quot;The Marquette University Anthem,&quot; as it was originally known, is now referred to almost exclusively as &quot;Hail Alma Mater.&quot;
The tune was written by Liborius Semmann, a music teacher from Wisconsin.
The Fight Song is more commonly referred to as &quot;Ring Out Ahoya,&quot; although the actual meaning of the word &quot;Ahoya&quot; is open to a great deal of debate.
One leading theory is that the call of &quot;Ahoya&quot; was often made by sailors on the <a>Potomac river</a> while passing <a>Georgetown University</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, hence Georgetown getting its nickname of &quot;Hoyas.&quot;
The cheer was then relayed from priests and professors moving between the two Jesuit universities.
