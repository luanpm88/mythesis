<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Queen's College, Glasgow</h3>
<p>The origins of The Queen's College, Glasgow date back as far as 1875 when the Glasgow School of Cookery was established.
In 1908, the Glasgow School of Cookery merged with the West End School of Cookery, which had been established in 1878, to form the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science, which was affectionately referred to by Glaswegians as &quot;The Dough School&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Glasgow Polytechnic</strong> was originally planned by the Corporation of Glasgow as two separate colleges on adjacent sites in central Glasgow: the College of Science and Technology and the College of Commerce.
Before opening in 1971 a new polytechnic institution of higher education had been agreed and the Glasgow College of Technology opened to students with the objective of offering <a>Council for National Academic Awards</a> (CNAA) <a>degrees</a> at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
The Scottish Office and the local authority were both opposed to the creation of further Central Institutions in Scotland and the legislation enabling the creation of Polytechnics was specific to England and Wales.
The new institution was constituted under a set of Instruments and Articles of Governance derived from that of the Polytechnics but specific to Glasgow: it had an Academic Board and a Governing Council establishing considerable academic independence but ultimately answerable to the Corporation of Glasgow.
The formal opening of the College took place in 1972.</p>
<p>The College was under the governance of <a>Glasgow Corporation</a> until 1975 when the newly created <a>Strathclyde Regional Council</a> became the <a>funding body</a> and a new <a>constitution</a> was put in place.
In 1985, ownership passed from the Regional Council to an independent <a>board of governors</a> who received their funds directly from the <a>Scottish Education Department</a>.
In subsequent years, the institution changed its name three times for promotional purposes: Glasgow College (1987); 'Glasgow College - A Scottish Polytechnic; and Glasgow Polytechnic (1991).</p>
<h2>Glasgow Caledonian University</h2>
<p>In 1992, The <a>Secretary of State for Scotland</a> approved the <a>merger</a> of Glasgow Polytechnic and The Queen's College, Glasgow to form Glasgow Caledonian University, which opened on 1 April 1993.</p>
<p>The aim of the new university was to offer non-<a>elitist</a>, high quality <a>education</a> and <a>training</a> to a wide and diverse range of <a>students</a>.

<p>Glasgow Caledonian received its University status in April 1993.

In the 2007 league tables Glasgow Caledonian was one of the very few post 1992 Universities to rank within the top 50 in at least one of the League tables.
The Times good university guide 2009 stated that 'With Glasgow Caledonian's accent firmly on widening participation in higher education, the university will always struggle in league tables such as ours, but it is well-regarded by employers, and applications have been healthy'.
The league tables contain 114 Universities in the whole of the UK.</p>
The 2010 edition published in April 2009 showed that Caledonian was the only University in Glasgow to have improved on its previous rank.
The university as a result did better than many other Scottish institutions such as <a>Abertay University</a>, <a>Edinburgh Napier University</a>, <a>Queen Margaret University</a> and the <a>University of the West of Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years the University has became more involved within world wide research in a number of diverse fields such as health, society and the built and natural environment.

The results indicated that 30% of the researchers Glasgow Caledonian submitted were judged to be producing research at a level that is world-leading or internationally excellent.
More than 70% of the staff submitted were categorised as producing research that is internationally recognised.
<p>The University's submission in Allied Health Professions placed Glasgow Caledonian within the top ten universities in the UK.
In the area of rehabilitative health sciences in particular, which deals with the improvement of long-term health conditions such as arthritis and stroke, the University was judged to be the top research unit in the UK, ahead of  long-standing centres of excellence such as  <a>Southampton University</a> and <a>Manchester University</a>.</p>
<p>The University also excelled in the area Built and Natural Environment research which placed the University in the top twenty universities in the UK and the highest in Scotland.</p>
<p>As a result the University has received more funding for Research purposes than previous years.</p>
The university used to have three campuses: Park Campus located in Glasgow's <a>West End</a>, <a>Southbrae</a> Campus leased from and adjacent to <a>Jordanhill College of Education</a>, and the current City Campus.
However, Park Campus was sold to the <a>University of Glasgow</a> in January 2001 and Southbrae was given back to Jordanhill after the lease had expired.

<p>The campus contains a variety of modern lecture theatres, seminar rooms and laboratories.
