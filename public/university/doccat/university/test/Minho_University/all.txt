established$$$@@@%%%Praxe in Campus of Azur&#x00e9;m and Campus of Gualtar is radically different from the praxis of other universities.
established$$$@@@%%%The majority of these have the same hierarchy and terminology, mostly based on army terms, such as the Latin word of general, <em>dux</em>; however, <em>Academia Minhota</em> based its praxe tradition on clerical hierarchy, substituting &quot;dux veteranorum', ther term designating the head of praxe, for <em>pope</em>.</p>
