<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Minho, founded in 1973, is one of the then named &quot;New Universities&quot; that, at that time, deeply changed the landscape of higher education in Portugal.
<p>Located in the region of Minho, known for its significant economic activity and by the youth of its population, the University of Minho has played the role of development agent in the region.</p>

<p>To Minho University we can associate the praxe of the <em>Academia Minhota</em>.
Praxe in Campus of Azur&#x00e9;m and Campus of Gualtar is radically different from the praxis of other universities.
The majority of these have the same hierarchy and terminology, mostly based on army terms, such as the Latin word of general, <em>dux</em>; however, <em>Academia Minhota</em> based its praxe tradition on clerical hierarchy, substituting &quot;dux veteranorum', ther term designating the head of praxe, for <em>pope</em>.</p>
