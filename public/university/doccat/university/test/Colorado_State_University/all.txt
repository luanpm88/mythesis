established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Colorado State University is a land-grant institution classified as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Extensive. CSU was founded as Colorado Agricultural College in 1870, six years before the Colorado Territory gained statehood.
established$$$@@@%%%It was one of 68 land-grant colleges established under the Morrill Act of 1862.
established$$$@@@%%%Doors opened to a freshman class of 5 students in 1879.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>The university has operated under four different names:</p>

faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early years</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The act to create the university was signed by <a>Colorado Territory</a> governor <a>Edward M. McCook</a> in 1870 arising from the <a>Morrill Act</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%During the first years of its official existence, the university existed only on paper.
established$$$@@@%%%A board of 12 trustees was formed to &quot;purchase and manage property, erect buildings, establish basic rules for governing the institutions and employ buildings.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%But the near complete lack of funding by the territorial legislature for this mission severely hampered progress.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first  parcel of land for the campus was deeded in 1871 by Robert Dazell.
image_size$$$@@@%%%In 1872, the Larimer County Land Improvement Company contributed a second 80 acre (320,000 m&#x00b2;) parcel.
established$$$@@@%%%The first $1000 to erect buildings was finally allocated by the territorial legislature in 1874.
established$$$@@@%%%The funds were not sufficient, however, and trustees were required to find a matching amount, which they eventually obtained from local citizens and businesses.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Colorado Agricultural College Campus, 1920 with the Oval, Physics Building, and Guggenheim Hall showing.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%Among the institutions which donated matching funds was the local <a>Grange</a>, which was heavily involved in the early establishment of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%As part of this effort, in the spring of 1874 Grange No. 7 held a picnic and planting event at the corner of College Avenue and West Laurel Street, and later plowed and seeded 20 acres (80,000 m&#x00b2;) of <a>wheat</a> on a nearby field.
established$$$@@@%%%Within several months, the university's first building, a -by-24-foot red brick building nicknamed the &quot;Claim Shanty&quot; was finished, providing the first tangible presence of the institution in Fort Collins.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After <a>Colorado</a> achieved statehood in 1876, the territorial law establishing the college was required to be reauthorized.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1877, the <a>state legislature</a> created the eight-member <a>State Board of Agriculture</a> to govern the school.
established$$$@@@%%%Early in the 21st century, the governing board was renamed the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System.
established$$$@@@%%%The legislature also authorized a railroad right-of-way across the campus, and <a>mill levy</a> to raise money for construction of the campus' first main building, Old Main, which was completed in December 1878.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite wall cracks and other structural problems during the first year, the building was opened in time for the welcoming of the first five students on September 1, 1879 by university president <a>Elijah Evan Edwards</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During Colorado Agricultural College's first term in fall 1879, the school functioned more as a college-prep school than a college because of the lack of trained students.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Consequently the first course offerings were arithmetic, English, U.S. history, natural philosophy, horticulture and farm economy.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Students also labored on the college farm and attended daily chapel services.
established$$$@@@%%%The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member and with students.
established$$$@@@%%%The board's next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>President Charles Ingersoll</h4>
former_names$$$@@@%%%<p>Agricultural research was growing rapidly under Ingersoll.
city$$$@@@%%%The Hatch Act of 1887 provided federal funds to establish and maintain experiment stations at land-grant colleges.
established$$$@@@%%%Ainsworth Blount, CAC's first professor of practical agriculture and manager of the College Farm, had become known as a &quot;one man experiment station&quot;, and the Hatch Act expanded his original station to five Colorado locations.
type$$$@@@%%%The curriculum expanded as well, introducing coursework in engineering, animal science, and liberal arts.
established$$$@@@%%%New faculty members brought expertise in botany, horticulture, entomology, and irrigation engineering.
established$$$@@@%%%CAC made its first attempts at animal science during 1883&#x2013;84, when it hired veterinary surgeon George Faville.
country$$$@@@%%%Faville conducted free weekly clinics for student instruction and treatment of local citizen's diseased or injured animals.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Veterinary science at the college languished for many years following Faville's departure in 1886.
country$$$@@@%%%President Ingersoll believed the school neglected special programs for women.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite the reluctance of the institution's governing board, CAC began opening the door to liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll's last year at CAC the college had instituted a &quot;Ladies Course&quot; that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, stenography and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology.
established$$$@@@%%%Ingersoll's belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Turn of the century</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Colorado Agricultural College advertisement</a> Alston Ellis encountered limited funding and rapidly decision in 1895 to reduce the number of Experiment Stations.
established$$$@@@%%%Female students grew in number from 44 in 1892 to 112 in 1896, and by fall 1895, the college's new domestic-economy program was in place.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Football</a> had a one-year stint at CAC in 1893, but Ellis was not a supporter of extracurricular activities and especially was hostile toward football.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Barton Aylesworth became the school's fourth president in 1899, and the combination of his non-confrontational style with the presence of the vocal Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association on the governing board allowed ranching and <a>farming</a> interests to take the college's agricultural programs to new heights, greatly influencing the development of the entire school.
established$$$@@@%%%Initially, the influence of <a>ranching</a> interests brought tremendous progress to CAC's agricultural programs.
established$$$@@@%%%Enrollment quadrupled, studies in veterinary medicine were re-established, and CAC's Experiment Station benefited from lobbying that finally secured state appropriations.
established$$$@@@%%%Eventually, conflicts with agricultural interests may have prompted Aylesworth to begin promoting a balanced curriculum at CAC, which he then fought hard to defend.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The conflict also led him to tire and negotiate his resignation.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Aylesworth was a big supporter of extracurricular activities.
established$$$@@@%%%Football returned to the college in fall 1899, but <a>baseball</a> was the school's most popular sport.
free$$$@@@%%%In 1903, the women's basketball team won CAC's first unofficial athletic championship, culminating with a victory over the <a>University of Colorado</a>.
city$$$@@@%%%New clubs, fraternities, and sororities also emerged.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1905, the school had a fledgling music department, which two years later became the Conservatory of Music.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>President Charles Lory</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Taking office in 1909, CAC President Charles Lory oversaw the school's maturation and reconciled longstanding conflicts between supporters of a broad or specialized curriculum.
established$$$@@@%%%He embarked on a demanding schedule of personal appearances to make Colorado Agricultural College known as an institution that served the state's needs.
established$$$@@@%%%Another of Lory's notable achievements was putting the school on solid fiscal ground, meeting rising construction costs and freeing the institution of debt.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The onset of <a>World War I</a> influenced all aspects of CAC, but nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the institution's programs for farmers.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>World War I</a> created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>World War I</a> also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields.
established$$$@@@%%%In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the <a>Reserve Officers Training Corps</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A few months later CAC applied to establish an <a>ROTC</a> unit in <a>Fort Collins</a> and resurrected a defunct <a>National Guard</a> unit on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%During the early 1930s, CAC's community-wide activities were greatly influenced by the <a>Great Depression</a> and the <a>Dust Bowl</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food, and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought.
established$$$@@@%%%President Lory sought to help <a>Colorado</a> farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens, and played a significant role in a 1930s project that supplied <a>irrigation</a> water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Lory and the State Board had challenges of their own back on campus.
mascot$$$@@@%%%In response to claims that the university was falling behind national standards, the board retired or demoted several senior professors and administrators deemed past the peak of their proficiency, and hired new doctorate-holding personnel while consolidating sections of lecture courses.
established$$$@@@%%%A student petition led to the governing-board to change the college's name to more accurately reflect the diversity of its academic programs, and the school became the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or Colorado A&amp;M, in 1935.
established$$$@@@%%%President Lory announced his retirement in 1938, after 31 years of leadership.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<h3>From World War II into the modern era</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Soon after <a>Pearl Harbor</a>, Colorado A&amp;M began to look like a military post, with the college serving as many as 1,500 servicemen.
established$$$@@@%%%New President Roy Green tried to prepare for the sudden departure of students and arrival of servicemen by improving ROTC facilities, and introducing military-training programs.
students$$$@@@%%%Although servicemen filed onto campus, student enrollment at Colorado A&amp;M, 1,637 in fall 1942, dropped to 701 by fall 1943, and female students outnumbered their male counterparts for the first time.
established$$$@@@%%%When the war ceased in 1945, soldiers returning from Europe and the Pacific filled U.S. higher-education institutions.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Nearly 1,040 students attended the college in fall 1946, and about 1,600 students enrolled by spring 1946.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Close to 80 former Aggies died in <a>World War II</a> including football talent Lewis &quot;Dude&quot; Dent.
established$$$@@@%%%President Green did not live long enough to enjoy more stable days at Colorado A&amp;M, his life taken by a heart attack in 1948.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h4>Colorado A&amp;M becomes a University under Bill Morgan</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Colorado A&amp;M shed its image as a narrow technical college and became a university in appearance and title during the 1950s under president Bill Morgan.
students$$$@@@%%%Providing adequate student housing for an increasing number of youth approaching college age and improving cramped instructional facilities were among the first tests of Morgan's leadership.
established$$$@@@%%%He responded, and five new residence halls were completed between 1953&#x2013;1957.
established$$$@@@%%%Colorado A&amp;M took advantage of a new mill levy won through aggressive lobbying to construct several new academic facilities, among them Morgan Library, completed in 1964.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Academic offerings grew to include advanced degrees.
established$$$@@@%%%The State Board of Agriculture approved a doctoral degree in civil engineering in 1951, and three years later allowed other qualified departments to offer doctorates.
established$$$@@@%%%Morgan believed students earning this advanced degree should hold it from a university, and so began a campaign to change the name of Colorado A&amp;M.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1957, the <a>Colorado General Assembly</a> approved the new name of Colorado State University.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<h4>The 1960s: Student activism</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Colorado State became a scene of intense student <a>activism</a> during the 1960s and early 1970s.
established$$$@@@%%%The reduction of strict campus regulations for women was among the early targets of student activists, coming to the forefront in 1964 when a 21-year-old female student moved into unapproved off-campus housing to accommodate her late hours as editor of the student newspaper.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Continual student protests eventually led to the loosening of curfews for women and the opportunity for junior and senior coeds to live off campus.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>The civil-rights movement on campus also picked up momentum and visibility.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented a list of demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home.
established$$$@@@%%%Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.
established$$$@@@%%%Civil rights tension resurfaced in January 1970 during a peaceful student demonstration before a Colorado State-Brigham Young University basketball game in protest of alleged racist practices of the Mormon Church.
established$$$@@@%%%The demonstration became violent and clashes with riot police ensued.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<p>Anti-military protest took place in dramatic form at Colorado State from 1968&#x2013;70.
established$$$@@@%%%On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a placard tied to the memorial.
established$$$@@@%%%Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers.
established$$$@@@%%%In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held the second day of a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of <a>Cambodia</a> and the student deaths at <a>Kent State University</a>, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h4>1980s and 90s</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> Colorado State entered the 1980s with a new Veterinary Teaching Hospital and a rating of Class I research university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education.
established$$$@@@%%%The first half of the 1990s brought a renewed emphasis on undergraduate teaching and outreach arms of the university.
country$$$@@@%%%To support the balance, CSU President Albert Yates appointed a Commission on the Undergraduate Experience, established the Programs of Research and Scholarly Excellence, and implemented a post-tenure review policy for faculty.
established$$$@@@%%%Under Yates, the university also made significant efforts to improve administrative efficiency and reexamined its annual strategic planning.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On the evening of July 28, 1997, a flash flood ripped through <a>Fort Collins</a> and the Colorado State University campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Known as the &quot;Spring Creek Flood of '97&quot;, the flood resulted from a series of heavy thunderstorms over a two-day period in west <a>Fort Collins</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Five people drowned south of campus, and estimated damages citywide were in excess of $200 million.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Colorado State University campus suffered millions of dollars in damages to buildings and property, with Morgan Library and the Lory Student Center among the hardest hit.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Fortunately, no people on campus suffered serious injuries or death.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Future directions</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In his welcoming address for the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to set the standard for the 21st century public land-grant <a>research university</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He has identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries.
established$$$@@@%%%A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the <a>university</a> has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace.
established$$$@@@%%%Initial Superclusters in <a>infectious disease</a> and in <a>cancer research</a> have been launched, and an upcoming <a>clean energy</a> Supercluster dovetails with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability.
image_size$$$@@@%%%A <a>wind farm</a> is being built to power the main campus, and new residence halls have been constructed according to national <a>green building</a> standards.
image_size$$$@@@%%%A sustainability advisory committee has been charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While maintaining historic ties to local <a>agriculture</a>, administration officials have also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community.
established$$$@@@%%%Currently, CSU is party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships.
established$$$@@@%%%Another goal set by the university is to improve undergraduate education.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Essential tasks, Penley says, are access and graduation rates, particularly for qualified low-income and minority students, and an education international in scope suited to a global economy.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Facilities improvements underway include a new biocontainment research lab, a campus center for the arts, and a new <a>computer science</a> building.
nickname$$$@@@%%%With state financial support declining, CSU has also put a focus on alternate funding models based on market-based financial strategies and increased forms of private support.
type$$$@@@%%%Marketing and public relations have also become part of university strategy to attract quality students and increase public awareness of Colorado State.</p>
