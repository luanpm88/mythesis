Colorado State University is the state's <a>land grant</a> university, and the flagship campus <a>university</a> of the Colorado State University System.
Colorado State confers doctoral degrees in 38 fields of study, in addition to a professional degree in veterinary medicine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Colorado State University is a land-grant institution classified as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Extensive. CSU was founded as Colorado Agricultural College in 1870, six years before the Colorado Territory gained statehood.
It was one of 68 land-grant colleges established under the Morrill Act of 1862.
Doors opened to a freshman class of 5 students in 1879.</p>
<li>1935: <strong>Colorado College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts</strong> (<strong>Colorado A&amp;M</strong>)</li>
<li>1944: <strong>Colorado Agricultural and Mechanical College</strong> (<strong>Colorado A&amp;M</strong>)</li>
<li>1957: <strong>Colorado State University</strong></li>
<p>The act to create the university was signed by <a>Colorado Territory</a> governor <a>Edward M. McCook</a> in 1870 arising from the <a>Morrill Act</a>.
During the first years of its official existence, the university existed only on paper.
A board of 12 trustees was formed to &quot;purchase and manage property, erect buildings, establish basic rules for governing the institutions and employ buildings.&quot;
But the near complete lack of funding by the territorial legislature for this mission severely hampered progress.</p>
<p>The first  parcel of land for the campus was deeded in 1871 by Robert Dazell.
The first $1000 to erect buildings was finally allocated by the territorial legislature in 1874.
The funds were not sufficient, however, and trustees were required to find a matching amount, which they eventually obtained from local citizens and businesses.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Colorado Agricultural College Campus, 1920 with the Oval, Physics Building, and Guggenheim Hall showing.</a>
Among the institutions which donated matching funds was the local <a>Grange</a>, which was heavily involved in the early establishment of the university.
As part of this effort, in the spring of 1874 Grange No. 7 held a picnic and planting event at the corner of College Avenue and West Laurel Street, and later plowed and seeded 20 acres (80,000 m&#x00b2;) of <a>wheat</a> on a nearby field.
Within several months, the university's first building, a -by-24-foot red brick building nicknamed the &quot;Claim Shanty&quot; was finished, providing the first tangible presence of the institution in Fort Collins.</p>
<p>After <a>Colorado</a> achieved statehood in 1876, the territorial law establishing the college was required to be reauthorized.
In 1877, the <a>state legislature</a> created the eight-member <a>State Board of Agriculture</a> to govern the school.
Early in the 21st century, the governing board was renamed the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System.
The legislature also authorized a railroad right-of-way across the campus, and <a>mill levy</a> to raise money for construction of the campus' first main building, Old Main, which was completed in December 1878.
Despite wall cracks and other structural problems during the first year, the building was opened in time for the welcoming of the first five students on September 1, 1879 by university president <a>Elijah Evan Edwards</a>.</p>
<p>During Colorado Agricultural College's first term in fall 1879, the school functioned more as a college-prep school than a college because of the lack of trained students.
The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction.
Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member and with students.
The board's next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.</p>
Ainsworth Blount, CAC's first professor of practical agriculture and manager of the College Farm, had become known as a &quot;one man experiment station&quot;, and the Hatch Act expanded his original station to five Colorado locations.
New faculty members brought expertise in botany, horticulture, entomology, and irrigation engineering.
CAC made its first attempts at animal science during 1883&#x2013;84, when it hired veterinary surgeon George Faville.
Despite the reluctance of the institution's governing board, CAC began opening the door to liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll's last year at CAC the college had instituted a &quot;Ladies Course&quot; that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, stenography and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology.
Ingersoll's belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation.
In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.</p>
<h3>Turn of the century</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Colorado Agricultural College advertisement</a> Alston Ellis encountered limited funding and rapidly decision in 1895 to reduce the number of Experiment Stations.
Female students grew in number from 44 in 1892 to 112 in 1896, and by fall 1895, the college's new domestic-economy program was in place.
<a>Football</a> had a one-year stint at CAC in 1893, but Ellis was not a supporter of extracurricular activities and especially was hostile toward football.</p>
<p>Barton Aylesworth became the school's fourth president in 1899, and the combination of his non-confrontational style with the presence of the vocal Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association on the governing board allowed ranching and <a>farming</a> interests to take the college's agricultural programs to new heights, greatly influencing the development of the entire school.
Initially, the influence of <a>ranching</a> interests brought tremendous progress to CAC's agricultural programs.
Enrollment quadrupled, studies in veterinary medicine were re-established, and CAC's Experiment Station benefited from lobbying that finally secured state appropriations.
Eventually, conflicts with agricultural interests may have prompted Aylesworth to begin promoting a balanced curriculum at CAC, which he then fought hard to defend.
Football returned to the college in fall 1899, but <a>baseball</a> was the school's most popular sport.
By 1905, the school had a fledgling music department, which two years later became the Conservatory of Music.</p>
<p>Taking office in 1909, CAC President Charles Lory oversaw the school's maturation and reconciled longstanding conflicts between supporters of a broad or specialized curriculum.
He embarked on a demanding schedule of personal appearances to make Colorado Agricultural College known as an institution that served the state's needs.
Another of Lory's notable achievements was putting the school on solid fiscal ground, meeting rising construction costs and freeing the institution of debt.</p>
<p>The onset of <a>World War I</a> influenced all aspects of CAC, but nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the institution's programs for farmers.
<a>World War I</a> created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado.
<a>World War I</a> also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields.
In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the <a>Reserve Officers Training Corps</a>.
A few months later CAC applied to establish an <a>ROTC</a> unit in <a>Fort Collins</a> and resurrected a defunct <a>National Guard</a> unit on campus.
During the early 1930s, CAC's community-wide activities were greatly influenced by the <a>Great Depression</a> and the <a>Dust Bowl</a>.
The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food, and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought.
President Lory sought to help <a>Colorado</a> farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens, and played a significant role in a 1930s project that supplied <a>irrigation</a> water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.</p>
<p>Lory and the State Board had challenges of their own back on campus.
A student petition led to the governing-board to change the college's name to more accurately reflect the diversity of its academic programs, and the school became the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or Colorado A&amp;M, in 1935.
President Lory announced his retirement in 1938, after 31 years of leadership.</p>
<p>Soon after <a>Pearl Harbor</a>, Colorado A&amp;M began to look like a military post, with the college serving as many as 1,500 servicemen.
New President Roy Green tried to prepare for the sudden departure of students and arrival of servicemen by improving ROTC facilities, and introducing military-training programs.
When the war ceased in 1945, soldiers returning from Europe and the Pacific filled U.S. higher-education institutions.
President Green did not live long enough to enjoy more stable days at Colorado A&amp;M, his life taken by a heart attack in 1948.</p>
<h4>Colorado A&amp;M becomes a University under Bill Morgan</h4>
<p>Colorado A&amp;M shed its image as a narrow technical college and became a university in appearance and title during the 1950s under president Bill Morgan.
He responded, and five new residence halls were completed between 1953&#x2013;1957.
Colorado A&amp;M took advantage of a new mill levy won through aggressive lobbying to construct several new academic facilities, among them Morgan Library, completed in 1964.</p>
The State Board of Agriculture approved a doctoral degree in civil engineering in 1951, and three years later allowed other qualified departments to offer doctorates.
Morgan believed students earning this advanced degree should hold it from a university, and so began a campaign to change the name of Colorado A&amp;M.
In 1957, the <a>Colorado General Assembly</a> approved the new name of Colorado State University.</p>
<p>Colorado State became a scene of intense student <a>activism</a> during the 1960s and early 1970s.
The reduction of strict campus regulations for women was among the early targets of student activists, coming to the forefront in 1964 when a 21-year-old female student moved into unapproved off-campus housing to accommodate her late hours as editor of the student newspaper.
Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.
Civil rights tension resurfaced in January 1970 during a peaceful student demonstration before a Colorado State-Brigham Young University basketball game in protest of alleged racist practices of the Mormon Church.
The demonstration became violent and clashes with riot police ensued.</p>
On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a placard tied to the memorial.
Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers.
In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held the second day of a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of <a>Cambodia</a> and the student deaths at <a>Kent State University</a>, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.</p>
<p> Colorado State entered the 1980s with a new Veterinary Teaching Hospital and a rating of Class I research university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education.
The first half of the 1990s brought a renewed emphasis on undergraduate teaching and outreach arms of the university.
Under Yates, the university also made significant efforts to improve administrative efficiency and reexamined its annual strategic planning.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 28, 1997, a flash flood ripped through <a>Fort Collins</a> and the Colorado State University campus.
Known as the &quot;Spring Creek Flood of '97&quot;, the flood resulted from a series of heavy thunderstorms over a two-day period in west <a>Fort Collins</a>.
Five people drowned south of campus, and estimated damages citywide were in excess of $200 million.
<p>In his welcoming address for the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to set the standard for the 21st century public land-grant <a>research university</a>.
He has identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries.
A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the <a>university</a> has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace.
Initial Superclusters in <a>infectious disease</a> and in <a>cancer research</a> have been launched, and an upcoming <a>clean energy</a> Supercluster dovetails with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability.
<p>While maintaining historic ties to local <a>agriculture</a>, administration officials have also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community.
Currently, CSU is party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships.
Another goal set by the university is to improve undergraduate education.
The administration building, constructed in 1924, faces the Oval from the south end, and several academic buildings occupy its <a>perimeter</a>.
Guggenheim Hall, which stands at the north end of the Oval, was constructed in 1910 as a gift from U.S. Senator Simon F. Guggenheim to promote the study of home economics, and was recently renovated according to <a>green building</a> standards.</p>
The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan.
Holdings currently include more than 2 million <a>books</a>, bound journals, and government documents.</p>
<p>Colorado State University's oldest existing building is Spruce Hall, constructed in 1881.
Originally a dormitory that played a vital role in the early growth of the school's student enrollment, Spruce now houses the Division of Continuing Education and the Office of Admissions.
The newest academic building is the Behavioral Science building, which was completed in Summer 2010.
<p>The James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital complex was constructed in 1979 and consists of three main buildings, the Main Hospital, the Horse and Food Animal Hospital, and the Large Animal Isolation Facility.
<p>In addition to university property in <a>Fort Collins</a>, large tracts of land for research exist in CSU's name throughout the state of <a>Colorado</a>.
Among these is the <a>Pingree Park</a> campus situated in the <a>Mummy Range</a>  northwest of town.
It was initially selected by former CSU president Charles A. Lory and began classes for Civil Engineering and Forestry students in 1913 and 1915, respectively.
In the summertime, Pingree Park hosts educational programs for students in the College of <a>Natural Resources</a>, and is also used as a conference space for numerous corporations, government and private organizations, and universities.</p>
<p>The  Foothills Campus, located on northwest edge of <a>Fort Collins</a>, is home to <a>atmospheric sciences</a>, as well as several research and outreach centers.
The Department of Mechanical Engineering has converted an aircraft manufacturing facility near Christman Field into a Motorsport Research facility.</p>
<p>A new addition to the Foothills Campus, the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, opened in Fall of 2007 as an addition to the Judson M. Harper (former Vice President of Research) Research Complex.
It houses some of the University's top research facilities including three high-security containment &quot;pods.&quot;
The Board of Governors presides over the Colorado State University System, which comprises Colorado State University, Colorado State University-Pueblo, and CSU-Global Campus.
The Board consists of nine voting members appointed by the Governor of Colorado and confirmed by the Colorado State Senate, and four elected non-voting members.
A student and faculty representative from each university act as non-voting Board members.</p>
A 13 member Board of Governors oversees the Colorado State University System.
Douglas L. Jones serves as the current Chairman of the Board of Governors.</p>
<p>At its December 2008 public meeting, the Board of Governors of the CSU System decided it was in the best interest of all CSU system campuses to separate what had previously been a conjoined position of CSU System chancellor and CSU Fort Collins president.
On May 5, 2009 Joe Blake was named the finalist for the chancellor position.</p>
<p>Colorado State offers 150 programs of study across 8 colleges and 55 departments.
In addition to its notable programs in biomedical sciences, engineering, environmental science, agriculture, and human health and nutrition, CSU offers professional programs in disciplines including business, journalism, and construction management as well as in the liberal and performing arts, humanities, and social sciences.</p>
<p>Preparing students in land stewardship and natural resources, the College of Agricultural Sciences offers majors in traditional disciplines such as agronomy, animal science, and horticulture and Landscape Architecture, in addition to Organic Agriculture and Agribusiness degrees suited to contemporary developments.
The college-sponsored Specialty Crops Program aims to help local growers master production systems, and explore marketing opportunities for their specialty crops.</p>
Extension specialists, such as in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provide valuable health, nutrition, and food safety information to the public.
The Human Performance Clinical Research Laboratory in the Department of Health and Exercise Science provides heart attack prevention evaluations to underserved populations, and the Center for Community Partnerships works with citizens with disabilities.
The college also has a role in the new Colorado School of Public Health, to be jointly operated with UC Denver Health Sciences Center and the University of Northern Colorado.</p>

In 2006, <em><a>Money</a></em> ranked Fort Collins as the &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; in the United States.</p>
The student government is the Associated Students of Colorado State University.
<p>Sport Clubs at Colorado State University were established in 1978.
During the 1990s, the paper was twice selected as one of the top 12 daily student papers in the country.
This event, as well as president Penley's considerations of &quot;partnering&quot; out the Collegian by Gannett in January 2008, lead to proposals in making CSU's student media, including the Rocky Mountain Collegian, a not-for-profit organization independent from the university.
<p>KCSU is Colorado State's student run station, with a format focusing on alternative and college rock music, including <a>indie rock</a>, punk, hip-hop and electronic music.
KCSU first began broadcasting in 1964 as a station owned, operated and financed by students.
Following a long period as a professional station, KCSU again became student run in 1995, at which time the current format was adopted.
As with the Collegian and CTV, KCSU was hit hard by the 1997 flood, and for a time was forced to broadcast from remote locations.
Now back in its original Lory Student Center location, KCSU has benefited from revamped production facilities and updated equipment.</p>
CTV was founded in 1989, and currently broadcasts weeknights on the university cable station (Comcast channel 11) at 9pm, with reruns at 9am and 12 noon the next day.</p>
<p>Student-run magazine College Avenue was founded in 2005 with the goal, as put forth by its founding editors, of giving students a new forum to address controversial issues affecting the campus community from their own vantage point.
Since its first issue in fall 2005, the magazine has been released quarterly, the most recent issue released in spring 2008.</p>
<p>Greek life at Colorado State began in the fall of 1915.
Currently 5% of undergraduates join one of CSUs 19 <a>fraternities</a> and 14 <a>sororities</a>.
The <a>Beta Tau Chapter of Sigma Chi</a> is the only continuously active fraternity on campus since Greek Life was founded in 1915, having never been removed from campus or having it's charter removed.</pre>
<p>From 1932 until 1949, Colorado State University was home to the Eta chapter of [[Phrateres]], a philanthropic-social organization for female college students.
Eta was the 7th chapter installed and Phrateres eventually had over 20 chapters in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].
(The chapter name &quot;Eta&quot; was reused for the chapter installed at [[Arizona State University]] in 1958.)</p>
The Key Academic and Key Service Communities creates an academically focused residential community for freshmen who share a desire for academic achievement, active involvement in classes, community service, campus activities, and appreciation of diversity.
Residents share classes and take advantage of yearlong service opportunities with a close knit group of 19 other students.</p>
Students in the College of Natural Sciences can choose to live in the Ingersoll Residential College.</p>
Over the past ten years, <a>minority</a> enrollment has increased 35%, from 2,361 to 3,178, an increase from 10.9% to 13.2% of the student population.
Though progress has been made, increasing minority enrollment at CSU has been a challenge for school administrators, one made yet more difficult by high dropout rates in many Colorado high schools with concentrated minority populations.</p>
