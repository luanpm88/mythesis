<p><strong>Liaoning Normal University (LNU;</strong> ) is a teacher training university in <a>Dalian</a>, <a>Liaoning</a> Province, <a>China</a> under the provincial government.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Liaoning Normal University was established in August 1951, as part of the newly founded <a>People&#x2019;s Republic of China</a>&#x2019;s drive to reform the teacher training system.
Under the new <em>shifan</em> (&#x5e08;&#x8303;) system certain institutions of further and higher education were established with the role of training future teachers.
Financial incentives (such as tuition waivers, <a>stipend</a>s and <a>fellowship</a>s) were offered to encourage students to study at these institutions.
The normal universities comprised the highest point of this reformed system, and were the only institutions from which senior high school teachers could graduate.
Liaoning Normal University was one of the two normal universities (along with <a>Shenyang Normal University</a>, founded in the same year) founded in Liaoning province.</p>
<p>Currently Liaoning Normal University remains the provincial centre for teacher training in Liaoning.
<p>The Chinese government's recent move away from the <em>shifan</em> system had brought significant changes to the university.
Research originating from the university has resulted in 74 Science and Technology Progress Awards, 18 patents, and 190 contracts for technology or service transfer.</p>

<p>The move away from a narrow focus on education teaching has also resulted in an increased emphasis on business related subjects, in part through a partnership with <a>Missouri State University</a> who maintain a branch campus within the university's main campus.
Another avenue the university has pursued is language teaching and testing, both foreign languages for Chinese students (the university hosts both an International Japanese Language Testing Center and an <a>IELTS</a> Testing Center, and established a course training provincial government officials wishing to study at the <a>University of Ulster</a>) and the teaching of Chinese to overseas students (currently 338 students are enrolled on Chinese language courses).</p>
<p>Education remains, however, the main focus of the university, with a large education department and the maintenance of an affiliated high school for the purposes of teacher practice.
<p>Liaoning Normal University is sited on one campus, situated on Huang He Road (&#x9ec4;&#x6cb3;&#x8def;), in the west of Dalian.
The campus, which is divided into southern and northern sections by the road, occupies 116 areas, with 350,000 square meters of building space.
