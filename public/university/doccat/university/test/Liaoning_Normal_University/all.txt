established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Liaoning Normal University (LNU;</strong> ) is a teacher training university in <a>Dalian</a>, <a>Liaoning</a> Province, <a>China</a> under the provincial government.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Established in 1951 the university is primarily responsible for educating teachers to teach in high schools around the province, though non-teacher training courses are offered.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Liaoning Normal University was established in August 1951, as part of the newly founded <a>People&#x2019;s Republic of China</a>&#x2019;s drive to reform the teacher training system.
established$$$@@@%%%Under the new <em>shifan</em> (&#x5e08;&#x8303;) system certain institutions of further and higher education were established with the role of training future teachers.
established$$$@@@%%%Financial incentives (such as tuition waivers, <a>stipend</a>s and <a>fellowship</a>s) were offered to encourage students to study at these institutions.
established$$$@@@%%%The normal universities comprised the highest point of this reformed system, and were the only institutions from which senior high school teachers could graduate.
established$$$@@@%%%Liaoning Normal University was one of the two normal universities (along with <a>Shenyang Normal University</a>, founded in the same year) founded in Liaoning province.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Currently Liaoning Normal University remains the provincial centre for teacher training in Liaoning.
staff$$$@@@%%%The university comprises 10 colleges, divided into 25 departments, offering 39 programmes for those studying for a <a>bachelor's degree</a>, 36 for those studying for a <a>master's degree</a> and 2 for <a>doctoral candidates</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Chinese government's recent move away from the <em>shifan</em> system had brought significant changes to the university.
nickname$$$@@@%%%With more and more teachers are being recruited from regular universities, Liaoning Normal University (as with most normal universities) has expanded to offer a number of non-education-specific courses and to increase its focus on research.
type$$$@@@%%%The university now boasts, amongst others, a Ministry of Education sponsored Research Institute of Basic Education, an Ocean Economics and <a>Sustainable Development</a> Center and a center for researching the works of <a>Sun Zi</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Research originating from the university has resulted in 74 Science and Technology Progress Awards, 18 patents, and 190 contracts for technology or service transfer.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The move away from a narrow focus on education teaching has also resulted in an increased emphasis on business related subjects, in part through a partnership with <a>Missouri State University</a> who maintain a branch campus within the university's main campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Another avenue the university has pursued is language teaching and testing, both foreign languages for Chinese students (the university hosts both an International Japanese Language Testing Center and an <a>IELTS</a> Testing Center, and established a course training provincial government officials wishing to study at the <a>University of Ulster</a>) and the teaching of Chinese to overseas students (currently 338 students are enrolled on Chinese language courses).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Education remains, however, the main focus of the university, with a large education department and the maintenance of an affiliated high school for the purposes of teacher practice.
free_label$$$@@@%%%This focus is reflected in the university's stated aim of its 10 year plan which is &quot; to become the province's largest center for teacher education and serve as a role model for other schools &quot;</p>
