motto$$$@@@%%%<h2>The Seminex controversy</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Concordia Seminary became a focus of national media attention in 1974 when 45 of its 50 faculty members, together with the vast majority of students, walked out to form a rival institution known as <a>Seminex</a>, or Concordia Seminary in Exile.
established$$$@@@%%%The Seminex walk-out protested the suspension of the seminary's president, <a>John Tietjen</a>, who faced charges from the conservative Synodical president, <a>Jacob Preus</a>, of allowing the teaching of false doctrine.
established$$$@@@%%%More specifically, the charges alleged that Tietjen had permitted the teaching of <a>historical-critical method</a>s of scriptural interpretation, rather than upon exegetical principles that consider scripture to be the inerrant word of God <em>(see <a>Biblical inerrancy</a>)</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%Seminex was never very successful, due mostly to its difficulties placing graduates in ministerial positions.
established$$$@@@%%%Seminex suffered a gradually declining enrollment over the course of the late 1970s.
established$$$@@@%%%The last St. Louis commencement was held in May 1983.
established$$$@@@%%%Seminex continued to exist as an educational institution on the LSTC campus in Chicago through the end of 1987.</p>
