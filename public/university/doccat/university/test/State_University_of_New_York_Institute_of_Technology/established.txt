<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally a graduate and upper-division institution, the college offered classes in temporary locations and at extension sites for several years until the first buildings were constructed on the permanent Marcy, New York campus in the 1980s.
In 2002, the SUNY Board of Trustees approved a mission change, enabling SUNYIT to offer lower-division programs in professional, technological, and applied studies.
In fall 2003, SUNYIT admitted its first class of freshmen, becoming a full, four-year institution.</p>
The &quot;west campus&quot; property of more than 300 acres is reserved for the development of the Marcy NanoCenter at SUNYIT.</p>
<p>The campus&#x2019;s current two residential complexes &#x2013; Mohawk and Adirondack Halls &#x2013; offer the privacy and convenience of apartments, with students sharing suites in townhouse-style buildings.
A third complex, Oriskany Residence Hall, is under construction and will be ready for occupancy by the entering freshman class in fall 2011.
<p>Construction of a $20 million field house and turf field is scheduled to be completed in 2011.
Events hosted by Student Association and its constituents include FragFest, a <a>LAN party</a> that regularly attracts a large number of gamers from the region, as well as Wildcat Family Fest (in close association with the Alumni Association), a parent and alumni weekend.</p>
