established$$$@@@%%%In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from in front of the library.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In September 2006, the Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university's &quot;Capital Campaign&quot; to raise $50 million dollars.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won't get damaged by vandals.</p>

free_label$$$@@@%%%<h3>Free Speech policy</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school newspaper, <em><a>The Towerlight</a></em>, announced that in February 2008, the school administration was planning to implement a &quot;Free Speech Policy&quot;.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Within the policy, it defines several things that would be considered <a>free speech</a>, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;.
established$$$@@@%%%Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels it is a mistake to exclude students from the decision making process&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;.
established$$$@@@%%%It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the <em>Student Leadership Council</em> that consists of student leaders who are in charge of very large student groups.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Several of the students contested that not only did they not know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not even know that kind of committee even existed.</p>
