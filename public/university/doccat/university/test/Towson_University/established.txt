It is part of the <a>University System of Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>TU was originally a <a>training school</a> for teachers in <a>Baltimore</a>, and over the years it has expanded and evolved into a 4-year degree granting institution consisting of 8 colleges with over 20,000 students enrolled.
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Maryland State Normal School</h3>
<p>[[Image:TUNewell.jpg|right|thumb|[[McFadden Newell|McFadden Alexander Newell]]|125px]] The <a>Maryland Legislature</a> established what would become Towson University in 1865, with the allocation of funds directed toward Maryland&#x2019;s first teacher-training school, or <a>normal school</a>.
On January 15, 1866, this institution, known as the Maryland State Normal School (MSNS), officially opened its doors.
Located then at Red Man's Hall in <a>Baltimore</a>, the school originally enrolled eleven students and fostered three faculty members.
<a>McFadden Alexander Newell</a> served as the school's first principal as well as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and oversaw the first graduating class of sixteen students in June 1886.
The following year, the General Assembly appropriated money to construct an exclusive building to house the burgeoning school.
In 1876, the school moved its faculty and 206 students to this new facility located in West Baltimore on Carrollton &amp; Lafayette Street.
and the Maryland State Department of Education.
The average <a>grade point average</a> was a 3.45 and the middle 50% of matriculating students had <a>ACT</a> composite scores between 20-24.
Also, in 2006 Towson achieved more enrollment in its business school than any college in the state of Maryland.</pre>

<p>About 77% of the freshman class, and over 4,400 students among all four classes, reside on campus.
The University has 15 residence halls, which include apartment complexes, modern high-rise towers, and more traditional two- and three-story residential buildings.
The on-campus shuttle travels to most sections of the school, while the off-campus shuttles travel to more remote parts of TU, including some housing complexes (University Village) that students live in that are on the outskirts of the campus.
There is also direct access to the <a>MTA Maryland</a> buses with services connecting to the <a>light rail</a>.</p>
<p>The value of the updated wired network and new wireless network is $3.2 million.
<p>On April 11, 2007, <a>Baltimore County</a> officials announced that they may provide wireless internet access throughout the county.
However, they will first pilot the program in the <a>Towson</a> area, using donated bandwidth from Towson University to send signals to the Towson area.</p>
<p>The Towson University Police Department (TUPD) is the primary law enforcement agency servicing the students, faculty, and visitors within the campus limits and adjacent streets and roadways.
The TUPD is aided by the <a>Baltimore County Police Department</a> as directed by authority.
<p>As a response to the University System of Maryland&#x2019;s (USM) desire for Towson University to grow its enrollment, a new Campus Master Plan was developed for the university and approved by the USM, Board of Regents in December 2003.
The university found that in the past, it has been guided by master plans that focused inward, resulting in disjointed campus development that was disconnected from the larger Towson community.</p>
addresses both <a>University System of Maryland</a> requirements and community concerns.
It contains over 70 specific initiatives that range from growing diversity to increasing student involvement in service learning projects.
<p>Towson University is committed to social and environmental responsibility.
Students partake in &#x201c;Trayless Tuesdays&#x201d; and receive incentives for using reusable mugs.
Sustainability has also been incorporated into first year orientation so that students can begin a dialogue on environmental stewardship in their daily lives.
Towson looks forward to having its initiatives analyzed for the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card.</p>
<p><a>right</a>  Before the 1960s, the name of the sports teams at Towson were known as the &quot;Towson College Knights&quot;.
Towson student <a>John Schuerholz</a> pushed for a new mascot, and the tiger was officially adopted in 1962.
Schuerholz later became general manager of the <a>Atlanta Braves</a> and is the team's president as of 2008.
The university's present baseball complex is named in his honor.</p>
<p>According to school newspaper <em><a>The Towerlight</a></em>, when the Student Government Association first bought the tiger statue that sits outside Cook Library in 1996, the organization hoped to boost school spirit.
Instead, it became subject to vandalism and disrepair.
In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from in front of the library.</p>
<p>In September 2006, the Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university's &quot;Capital Campaign&quot; to raise $50 million dollars.
<p>The new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007 where Caret said it would be  &quot;visible to passersby on York Road as well as students&quot;.</p>
<p>Towson University is one of the first colleges in the United States to have a president who has his own <a>blog</a> and <a>podcast</a>.. Robert Caret created the blog and  podcast to convey different messages to TU students.</p>
<p>Towson is the first four year institution in Maryland to enact a campus-wide smoke-free policy starting August 1, 2010.

<p>Under the leadership of President Bob Caret the University has placed a greater emphasis on the athletics program.
Since joining the league in 2001-02, the Tigers have won CAA titles in men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lacrosse, women&#x2019;s swimming, men&#x2019;s soccer and men&#x2019;s golf.
<p>Tiger student-athletes have distinguished themselves in the classroom as well as on the field of competition.
<p>In May 2011, the department will break ground on the future of Towson Athletics as it begins construction of Tiger Arena, a new 5000-seat, state-of-the-art arena for basketball, volleyball and gymnastics, slated to open in the Spring of 2013.</p>
<p>Tigerfest is TU's annual spring festival that features interactive activities for students, as well as live musical entertainment.
Tigerfest, which is also open to the public (not just TU students), occurs in late April and is held on Burdick Field.
The event has become increasingly popular throughout its history, mainly because mainstream music acts headline Tigerfest each year.
<a>The Roots</a>, <a>Immortal Technique</a>, and <a>Alex Band</a> of <a>The Calling</a> performed at the  2008 Tigerfest on April 26.
Artists such as <a>Third Eye Blind</a>, <a>Dashboard Confessional</a>, <a>The Used</a>, and <a>Yellowcard</a> have appeared at Tigerfest in the past.
The concert also featured <a>Shiny Toy Guns</a>, <a>Vedera</a>, and <a>Ace Enders</a> as opening acts.<a>N.E.R.D.</a> headlined the 2010 festival and only played 50 minutes of their 90 minute set for a crowd of 5,000 people.</p>
<p>Towson University, Maryland&#x2019;s Metropolitan University, is committed to addressing education, economic development and broad social issues.
To further Towson&#x2019;s role as a premier metropolitan university, the Division of Economic and Community Outreach (DECO) was established in 2004 as an initiative of President Robert L. Caret.
DECO&#x2019;s charge is to provide a focus for engagement with the external community and to provide a path into the university's research and project talent.
The program interacts with Cherry Hill&#x2019;s civic leaders, community organizations and citizens, the Learning Zone hopes to serve as a resource for the academic progress of Cherry Hill&#x2019;s young residents and improvement of the overall environment in the community.</p>
<p> The <a>Towson Speech and Debate</a> team has close ties with the <a>Baltimore Urban Debate League</a> and often volunteers people from the team and the university to judge and facilitate the running of the tournaments.</p>
<p>The university often acts as a host for league tournaments at least once a year.</p>
<p>President Caret has also established a program called <em>Adopt-A-Campus</em>, which gives local businesses, organizations and others an opportunity to help beautify the TU campus.
<p>The school newspaper, <em><a>The Towerlight</a></em>, announced that in February 2008, the school administration was planning to implement a &quot;Free Speech Policy&quot;.
Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels it is a mistake to exclude students from the decision making process&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;.
It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the <em>Student Leadership Council</em> that consists of student leaders who are in charge of very large student groups.
<p>The administration is currently reworking the policy and will rename it the <em>Time, Place and Manner policy</em>.&lt;ref
