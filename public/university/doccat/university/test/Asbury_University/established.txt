<h2>History</h2>
<p> Asbury College was established in 1890 by <a>John Wesley Hughes</a> in <a>Wilmore</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.
It was originally called the Kentucky Holiness College, but was later renamed after Bishop <a>Francis Asbury</a>, the &quot;Father of American Methodism&quot; and a circuit-riding evangelist.
Asbury was instrumental in Methodist education in central Kentucky, having founded the state's first Methodist school, <a>Bethel Academy</a>, in 1790; its site lies near <a>High Bridge</a>, only about four miles (6 km) south of Wilmore.
After being pushed out as President of Asbury College in 1905, Hughes went on to found another college, Kingswood College, in <a>Breckinridge County, Kentucky</a>.
Despite his disappointment over being removed at Asbury,  Hughes wrote in his 1923 autobiography:  &quot;Being sure I was led of God to establish (Asbury College), it being my college child born in poverty, mental perplexity, and soul agony, I loved it from its birth better than my own life.
My appreciation of what it has done, what it is doing, and what it promises to do in the future, is such that I am willing to lay down my life for its perpetuation.&quot;
In 1928, Hughes was invited to break ground for Asbury College's new chapel, Hughes Auditorium, which is still in use today.</p>
<p>Under great financial difficulty, Asbury College hired Dr. <a>Henry Clay Morrison</a>, a Methodist evangelist and editor of the <em>Pentecostal Herald</em> magazine, as its president in 1910.
With the help of his <em>Pentecostal Herald</em> readers and his nationwide reputation as a great preacher (<a>William Jennings Bryan</a> regarded him the &quot;greatest pulpit orator on the American continent&quot;), Morrison was able to pay off large debts owed by the college and increase its reputation and student body.
After stepping down as president in 1925, Morrison was asked once again to assume the presidency in 1933 under another financial crisis.
<p>Succeeding Morrison as president of Asbury College was his Executive Vice President, <a>Z.T. Johnson</a>, the first alumnus of the college to serve as its president.
The longest-tenured president in the school's history to date (1940&#x2013;1966), Johnson's presidency at Asbury College was marked by growth, both of the student body and the campus physical plant.
Campus improvements during his administration included an amphitheater, a 9-hole golf course, an athletic field with a quarter-mile track, a  farm, twenty-one duplexes, a triplex, an 18-unit apartment, eight faculty homes, five dormitories (including the Johnson Men's Dormitory), a student center, fine arts building, a library addition, a science hall, and the Z.T. Johnson Cafeteria.
It was also under Johnson's administration that Asbury College moved to full racial integration in 1962.</p>
<p>On October 5, 2007, Dr. Sandra Gray was inaugurated as the seventeenth president of Asbury.
She had previously served as <a>Provost</a> and as professor of business management at the school.
Her inaugural challenge was given by <a>Mitch McConnell</a>, <a>United States Senator</a> from Kentucky and <a>Minority Leader</a> of the Senate.
Gray was the first female president of the College.</p>
<p>March 5, 2010 Asbury College became Asbury University.
Asbury Seminary, in honor of the promotion, displayed a congratulations banner for their sister school on the main road of Wilmore, KY and decorated the famous statue of Francis Asbury with a new &quot;Asbury University&quot; T-shirt.
Nearly 90 percent of the University's students live on campus.
The University offers masters degrees in education and alternative certification programs.
