established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> Asbury College was established in 1890 by <a>John Wesley Hughes</a> in <a>Wilmore</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was originally called the Kentucky Holiness College, but was later renamed after Bishop <a>Francis Asbury</a>, the &quot;Father of American Methodism&quot; and a circuit-riding evangelist.
established$$$@@@%%%Asbury was instrumental in Methodist education in central Kentucky, having founded the state's first Methodist school, <a>Bethel Academy</a>, in 1790; its site lies near <a>High Bridge</a>, only about four miles (6 km) south of Wilmore.
established$$$@@@%%%After being pushed out as President of Asbury College in 1905, Hughes went on to found another college, Kingswood College, in <a>Breckinridge County, Kentucky</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Kingswood College no longer exists.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite his disappointment over being removed at Asbury,  Hughes wrote in his 1923 autobiography:  &quot;Being sure I was led of God to establish (Asbury College), it being my college child born in poverty, mental perplexity, and soul agony, I loved it from its birth better than my own life.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As the days have come and gone, with many sad and broken-hearted experiences, my love has increased.
established$$$@@@%%%My appreciation of what it has done, what it is doing, and what it promises to do in the future, is such that I am willing to lay down my life for its perpetuation.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In 1928, Hughes was invited to break ground for Asbury College's new chapel, Hughes Auditorium, which is still in use today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Under great financial difficulty, Asbury College hired Dr. <a>Henry Clay Morrison</a>, a Methodist evangelist and editor of the <em>Pentecostal Herald</em> magazine, as its president in 1910.
established$$$@@@%%%With the help of his <em>Pentecostal Herald</em> readers and his nationwide reputation as a great preacher (<a>William Jennings Bryan</a> regarded him the &quot;greatest pulpit orator on the American continent&quot;), Morrison was able to pay off large debts owed by the college and increase its reputation and student body.
established$$$@@@%%%After stepping down as president in 1925, Morrison was asked once again to assume the presidency in 1933 under another financial crisis.
mascot$$$@@@%%%He served his second term until 1940.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Succeeding Morrison as president of Asbury College was his Executive Vice President, <a>Z.T. Johnson</a>, the first alumnus of the college to serve as its president.
established$$$@@@%%%The longest-tenured president in the school's history to date (1940&#x2013;1966), Johnson's presidency at Asbury College was marked by growth, both of the student body and the campus physical plant.
established$$$@@@%%%Campus improvements during his administration included an amphitheater, a 9-hole golf course, an athletic field with a quarter-mile track, a  farm, twenty-one duplexes, a triplex, an 18-unit apartment, eight faculty homes, five dormitories (including the Johnson Men's Dormitory), a student center, fine arts building, a library addition, a science hall, and the Z.T. Johnson Cafeteria.
president$$$@@@%%%During his term as president, the student enrollment rose from 526 to 1,135.
established$$$@@@%%%It was also under Johnson's administration that Asbury College moved to full racial integration in 1962.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On October 5, 2007, Dr. Sandra Gray was inaugurated as the seventeenth president of Asbury.
established$$$@@@%%%She had previously served as <a>Provost</a> and as professor of business management at the school.
established$$$@@@%%%Her inaugural challenge was given by <a>Mitch McConnell</a>, <a>United States Senator</a> from Kentucky and <a>Minority Leader</a> of the Senate.
established$$$@@@%%%Gray was the first female president of the College.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>March 5, 2010 Asbury College became Asbury University.
established$$$@@@%%%Asbury Seminary, in honor of the promotion, displayed a congratulations banner for their sister school on the main road of Wilmore, KY and decorated the famous statue of Francis Asbury with a new &quot;Asbury University&quot; T-shirt.
