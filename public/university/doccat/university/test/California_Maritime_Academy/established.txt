<p>The <strong>California Maritime Academy</strong> (also known as <strong>CMA</strong>, <strong>Cal Maritime</strong>, and <strong>CSU, Maritime</strong>) is one of 23 campuses in the <a>California State University</a> system and is one of only seven degree-granting maritime academies in the <a>United States</a>.
It is located in <a>Vallejo</a>, <a>California</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
253 was signed into law by Governor <a>C.
The bill authorized the creation of the school, appointment of a Board of Governors to manage the school and the acquisition of a training vessel.
The school's mission was &quot;<em>to give practical and theoretical instruction in navigation, seamanship, steam engines, gas engines, and electricity in order to prepare young men to serve as officers in the American Merchant Marine.</em>&quot;
By 1930 a training vessel and a school site was acquired, the original location of what would become Cal Maritime was California City (now <a>Tiburon, California</a>) in the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the <a>Great Depression</a>, the early days of the Academy were full of financial uncertainty.
As early as 1933, some state legislators were calling for the school's abolition.
In order to save money, the cadets and instructors alike lived and held classes aboard the training vessel, the <em>T.S.
Only after the passage of the <a>Merchant Marine Act of 1936</a> did the funding for the Academy become stabilized.</p>
By 1940 the Academy was granting Bachelor of Science degrees and Naval Reserve commissions to its graduates; this step marked the beginning of the transition from the status of trade school to college.
During <a>World War II</a> the Academy moved to its present location in <a>Vallejo, California</a> in 1943.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, after surviving another round of budget cuts and calls for the Academy's abolition, Cal Maritime became a four-year institution.
The 1970s also marked the time when the first minority and female cadets graduated from Cal Maritime.</p>
<p>In 1996 Cal Maritime became the twenty-second campus of the California State University system.
The current training vessel is the <em><a>T.S. Golden Bear</a></em>, and is the third training ship to carry that name.</p>
Nichols due to Navy requirements for regular Navy officers to be in charge of Navy-owned ships.</li>
<li>Early WWII &#x2013; Superintendent and Master became separate positions.</li>
<li>On February 27, 1975, the title of &quot;Superintendent&quot; was changed to &quot;President.&quot;</li>
In <a>2008</a> the U.S. News and World Report ranked Cal Maritime as the 6th best Baccalaureate College on the West Coast.
It is also the only maritime academy on the west coast.</p>
<p>There is no armed service obligation attached to graduation from the California Maritime Academy.
However, financial aid and additional career opportunities exist for those students who choose to participate in any of the several military programs available on the CMA campus:</p>
In the 2004-2005 Academic year the Women's Basketball was formed and now also competes in the Cal Pac Conference.
That victory earned it the right to serve as the U.S. representative in the annual Student World Yachting Cup championships in October 2010 in La Rochelle, France, where it placed 5th of 14.</p>
