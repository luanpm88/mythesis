<h2>History</h2>
Loyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the <a>Society of Jesus</a>, and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of <a>St.
<p>The college's first campus was on Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore.
In 1855, Loyola relocated to a larger facility in the city's historic Mount Vernon neighborhood, and moved to its present Evergreen campus in north Baltimore in 1922.
Evening classes commenced in 1942.</p>
<p>In 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973.
<p>Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with <a>Mount Saint Agnes College</a>, a neighboring women's college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining.
That same year, the college's Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.</p>
The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the college's <a>Board of Trustees</a> announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution's name to Loyola University Maryland.
Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the <a>Maryland Higher Education Commission</a>, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19.
The <a>Reverend</a> <a>Brian F. Linnane</a>, the <a>university</a>'s <a>president</a>, stated that the &quot;<a>college</a>&quot; designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with <a>graduate programs</a>, was better reflected in its new name.
Some alumni were disappointed because they felt the change made the institution less distinct from <a>Loyola University Chicago</a>, <a>Loyola University New Orleans</a> and <a>Loyola Marymount University</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Ignatius Loyola.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ignatius of Loyola]]]]  Loyola University Maryland was founded by the Society of Jesus in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola.
The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate <em><a>Ad maiorem Dei gloriam</a></em> (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the &quot;greater glory of God&quot;.
This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular.
Loyola's focus on <a>cura personalis</a>, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end.
A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.</p>
Major contributions include a $1 million grant from the <a>Jack Kent Cooke</a> Foundation to increase enrollment of low income students.
<p>The foundation of a Loyola education is a broad core program that covers basic knowledge and concepts in the humanities, math and science, and the social sciences.
Undergraduate degrees are awarded in three schools, Loyola College, the School of Education, and the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the university's transition to its new name, the College of Arts and Sciences became Loyola College on August 19, 2009.</p>
<p>Since 1946 the department of education has been one of the stronger academic pillars at Loyola.
With the 2009 name designation change, President Linnane announced the opening of The School of Education which was to be led by Peter C. Murell, Jr. as the first dean.
The School was officially opened on October 14, 2009.
Its graduate department offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (M.Ed.), the Certificate of Advanced Study in School Management (C.S.M.), and the Certificate of Advanced Study in Education (CASE).</p>
The SAT average of the class is usually in the range of around 1200, a score that ranks in the upper 20% for all college-bound students nationwide.</p>
<p>The class of 2013 was the last applicant class that was required to submit SAT scores.
More than 139 schools were eligible for inclusion in the rankings.</strong></em></li>

<p>On the eastern side of the Quad, and in the center of campus, is the Tudor-style Humanities Center, originally built by the Garrett family in 1895 as a wedding gift for one of their children.
Unfortunately, the child died during a trip to England, and the residence became a rehabilitation center for men blinded during the war.
In 1921, Loyola's Jesuits purchased the Evergreen property from the Garretts and gradually moved the college from its location on Calvert Street.
The mansion was originally used for classes, but then became the Jesuit residence.
In 1955, it suffered severe fire damage and was converted to offices following the restoration.
Today, the Humanities Center houses 16 departments, including Admissions, Alumni Relations, Financial Aid and the Philosophy, Theology, and History departments.</p>
