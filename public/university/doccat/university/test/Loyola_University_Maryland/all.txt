chancellor$$$@@@%%%Early (educator)|John Early]], founder of Loyola.]]
established$$$@@@%%%Loyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the <a>Society of Jesus</a>, and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of <a>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Ignatius of Loyola</a>.
country$$$@@@%%%Loyola College in Maryland is the ninth-oldest among the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college's first campus was on Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1855, Loyola relocated to a larger facility in the city's historic Mount Vernon neighborhood, and moved to its present Evergreen campus in north Baltimore in 1922.
established$$$@@@%%%Evening classes commenced in 1942.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Expansion</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Today, the college's list of graduate programs has grown to include psychology, modern studies, pastoral counseling, computer science, and software engineering.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with <a>Mount Saint Agnes College</a>, a neighboring women's college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining.
established$$$@@@%%%That same year, the college's Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Working from these foundations, Loyola has transformed itself from a small, commuter college into a residential college with an undergraduate population of more than 3,000 students.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1981, Loyola established a separate business school: The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, Jr., School of Business and Management.
established$$$@@@%%%The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<h3>Designation change</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Executive Committee of the college's <a>Board of Trustees</a> announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution's name to Loyola University Maryland.
established$$$@@@%%%Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the <a>Maryland Higher Education Commission</a>, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Reverend</a> <a>Brian F. Linnane</a>, the <a>university</a>'s <a>president</a>, stated that the &quot;<a>college</a>&quot; designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with <a>graduate programs</a>, was better reflected in its new name.
established$$$@@@%%%Some alumni were disappointed because they felt the change made the institution less distinct from <a>Loyola University Chicago</a>, <a>Loyola University New Orleans</a> and <a>Loyola Marymount University</a>.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular.
established$$$@@@%%%Loyola's focus on <a>cura personalis</a>, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end.
established$$$@@@%%%A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.</p>
