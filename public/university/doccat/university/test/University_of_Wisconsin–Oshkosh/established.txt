It is part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> and offers both bachelor and master degrees.
The University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Oshkosh is the third-largest university in Wisconsin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1871 the school opened as Oshkosh State Normal School, <a>Wisconsin</a>'s third teacher-training school.
Oshkosh Normal was the first state <a>normal school</a> in the United States to have a kindergarten.</p>
<p>The university was called Oshkosh State Teachers College from 1927 to 1951, Wisconsin State College&#x2013;Oshkosh from 1951 to 1964, and Wisconsin State University&#x2013;Oshkosh from 1964 to 1971.
It became part of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> in 1971.</p>
<p>Until the 1960s the Oshkosh student body was almost exclusively white.
In 1968, when students protested against the lack of black faculty and black-oriented courses, the university expelled 94 students, mostly black, after using baton-wielding riot police to arrest them.
The events were marked in a campus exhibit in 2008-09.
The administration at the time has been described as &quot;conservative, paternalistic&quot; and &quot;ruled by elderly white males in the twilight of their careers&quot;.</p>
<p>The university has been expanding in capacity and infrastructure.
Since 2005, the institution has undertaken several green building projects and a Growth Agenda for new programs, faculty hiring and increased student population.
<p>In 2010, the campus opened a refurbished dining hall as its new Student Success Center.
It is designed to be one of the most energy efficient buildings in the state, with a geothermal ground source heating system installed beneath a nearby parking lot.</p>
A new academic building, the first since 1971, will house the College of Business and allied departments from the College of Letters and Science, including Psychology, Geography, and Environmental Studies.
It is designed to use less than half the energy of similar buildings on campus, and to generate 10% of its energy from renewable technologies.
The building will have numerous green building features, including geothermal and solar technologies.
<p>Today, the school offers seven baccalaureate, seven masters, and one doctorate degrees in 73 programs spanning four colleges.
The college is reputed to be strong in accounting, nursing, business, teaching, and fine arts.</p>
<p>2010: Named &#x201c;Best for Vets&#x201d; by Military Times EDGE magazine, ranked first in the state and 36th in the nation.</p>
<p>More Regents' Teaching Excellence Awards than any other UW institution, including four individual faculty members and the departments of English, Biology, and Chemistry.</p>
Stadium (UW&#x2013;Oshkosh)|Titan Stadium]]]] Since 2003 the men's club volleyball team has finished in the top five every year except 2008 at the <a>National Intramural Recreational Sports Association</a> (NIRSA) championships.
In 2005, the team finished second, and first in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>The baseball program appeared in 5 <a>Division III</a> championship games between 1985 and 1994.
There have been eight Titans players to play in <a>Major League Baseball</a>: <a>Jim Magnuson</a>, Dan Neumeier, <a>Jim Gantner</a>, Dorian &quot;Doe&quot; Boyland, <a>Gary Varsho</a>, <a>Terry Jorgensen</a>, <a>Jarrod Washburn</a>, and <a>Jack Taschner</a>.</p>
<p>The men's basketball program was in the <a>NAIA Men's Basketball Championships</a> in 1960, 1963, 1967, and 1968; and the NCAA <a>Division III</a> Men's Basketball Championship in 1996-1998, and 2002-2003.</p>
<p>The men's gymnastics program won <a>NAIA</a> gymnastics championships under Titans Hall of Fame coach Ken Allen in 1973, 1974, and then 5 straight years from 1978 to 1982.
A recent multi-million dollar renovation was completed with support of the Oshkosh community.

<h3>Oshkosh State Normal School Historic District</h3>
<p>Three buildings on the original campus comprise this historic district.
Dempsey Hall serves as the administration center of the campus.
<p><a>thumb|right|Oviatt House</a> Moses Hooper moved to Oshkosh in 1863, and started construction of the house in 1882.
It was located at the north edge of the Wisconsin State Normal School at Oshkosh.
Hooper moved into his new residence on October 31, 1883.
The structure had modern amenities including hot water heat and running water.
The interior was painted by local painters Frank Waldo and Gustav Behncke.
The house was sold on September 20, 1900 to Dr. Charles W. Oviatt, a surgeon who paid $18,000 for the property.
After Oviatt's death in 1912, his heirs sold the house and grounds to the State Normal School Regents in 1913 with the agreement that the heirs could live in the house until June 1914.</p>
<p>The house was first used by the school as a women's dormitory, the first on campus.
Because the dormitory operated at a loss, school president Polk discontinued the venture in 1932.
After considering dismantling the building, Polk started renting the house from the school in 1934.
The following three presidents of the school also resided in the house, ending with President Penson in 1989.
The <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Oshkosh Foundation</a> moved its office in the house the following year.</p>
<p>The college turned the residence into a women's <a>dormitory</a> which could house up to 32 co-eds.
In the 1960s it was used as an honors dormitory until closing in 1967.
From 1967 until 1970 it housed the College of Nursing administrative offices.
When the College of Nursing was relocated to a new building, the structure was taken over by the Alumni Association, who have occupied it since 1970.
