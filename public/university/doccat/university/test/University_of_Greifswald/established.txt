<p> <a>thumb|250px|The <em>Hauptgeb&#x00e4;ude</em> (main building) was constructed between 1747 and 1750.
Today it houses the rector's office and some parts of the university administration as well as a baroque assembly hall.</a>
As Greifswald is a small, coastal student town, the relationship between the university and the town has mostly been close.
For instance, it was Heinrich Rubenow, then Lord Mayor of the city, who pushed for the establishment of a university in his town, and who became the university's first rector in the year 1456.]]
The <strong>University of Greifswald</strong> (; ), is located in <a>Greifswald</a>, <a>Germany</a>.
150 miles) north of <a>Berlin</a> and east of <a>Hamburg</a>, in close proximity to the sea and the major German summer holiday destinations <a>R&#x00fc;gen</a> and <a>Usedom</a>.
<p>Founded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436), it is one of the <a>oldest universities</a> in Europe, with generations of notable <a>alumni and staff</a> having studied or worked in Greifswald.
As the <a>fourth-oldest</a> university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of <a>Sweden</a> (1648&#x2013;1815) and <a>Prussia</a> (1815&#x2013;1945), respectively.
Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the <a>alma mater</a> across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a &quot;university with a town built around it&quot; rather than a town with a university.
<h2>History</h2>
<a>thumb|left|upright|The foundation of the university took place at Saint Nicolas' Cathedral.
The University of Greifswald was founded on October 17, 1456 with the approval of the <a>Holy Roman Empire</a> and the <a>Pope</a>.
This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of <a>Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania</a> and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral.
The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by <a>Caspar David Friedrich</a> and his brother and can still be visited today.
The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the <a>University of Rostock</a> (founded 1419).
Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.</p>
<p>In Germany, there are only three <a>older universities</a> by count of the years of existence: the <a>University of Heidelberg</a> (established 1386), the <a>University of Leipzig</a> (1409), and the <a>University of Rostock</a> (1419).</p>
<p>International co-operation with other institutions of higher education in <a>northern Europe</a> existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network <a>Hanse</a>.
From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from <a>Scandinavia</a>.
This was a relatively high percentage compared to the total number of students at the time.
Sources suggest a relatively segregated life of Swedish students in the primarily German university though.</p>

The early sixteenth century saw significant co-operation of the university, the <a>Lutheran</a> church, the city and the Duchy of Pomerania.
Professors of theology simultaneously served as pastors in the three cathedrals.
Professors of medicine usually served as personal physicians of the duke.
Professors of law where also working at the local courts while professors of the faculty of philosophy usually taught the sons and daughters of the ducal family.
<p>The <a>Reformation</a> was introduced at the university in 1539.
<a>Johannes Bugenhagen</a>, an alumnus of the university, was an important figure during the German and Scandinavian reformation as well as a good friend of <a>Martin Luther</a>.
After the secularisation of the monastery at <a>Eldena</a> near Greifswald, Duke Philipp I of <a>Pomerania</a> gave all revenue created by the now secularised <em><a>Amt</a> Eldena</em> to the university.
His successor, Duke <a>Ernst Ludwig</a>, began the construction of a college building, which could only be completed after his death.
Duke <a>Philipp Julius</a> presented the university a <a>gown</a> that was used by the rector on ceremonial occasions up until very recently.</p>
<p>In 1604, the <a>Greifswald University Library</a> became the first centralised <a>university library</a> in Germany.
The university signed a contract with a book printer from <a>Wittenberg</a>, Germany, for the amount of 2,000 <a>Gulden</a>.
This contract lasted nearly a century due to the disruption caused by the <a>Thirty Years' War</a> (1618&#x2013;1648).
The phrase <em><a>cuius regio, eius religio</a></em> as applied to the outcome of the <a>Protestant Reformation</a> is attributed to the early seventeenth century jurist Joachim Stephani (1544&#x2013;1623) of the University of Greifswald.</p>
<p>The Duke of Pomerania was in financial troubles and had not paid the professors.
As a solution, he gave the Amt Eldena to the university - a total of 140 square kilometres of land.
<p>After the <a>Peace of Westphalia</a> in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, came under <a>Swedish control</a>.
Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815.
Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden.
<p>The first university course in the <a>English language</a> in Germany was held in Greifswald in the year 1777.</p>
<p>The main administrative building - still in use today - was built during the &quot;good old Swedish years&quot; by Andreas Mayer, a mathematician by profession, in the style of <a>North German Baroque</a>.</p>

<a>thumb|upright|The <em>Rubenow-Denkmal</em> (Rubenow Monument) was erected in 1856 for celebration of the 400th anniversary of the university in honour of its founder and first rector, Heinrich Rubenow.</a>
When <a>Swedish Pomerania</a> became part of the Kingdom of <a>Prussia</a> in 1815, the University of Greifswald became the oldest university on Prussian territory.
Prussia recognised the potential of science and universities, thus extensive building activity and growing financial support enabled the University of Greifswald to grow further both in size and reputation.</p>
<p>In 1856, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university's founding, a monument was unveiled in the presence of King <a>Frederick William IV of Prussia</a>.
The monument is still at its place, and was carefully restaurated for the 550th anniversary 2006.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Law became <em>Faculty of Law and Economics</em> when an economic department was introduced in 1905.
In 1912, <a>Otto Jaekel</a>, a professor of paleontology in Greifswald, founded the German Paleontological Society.
The <em>Department of Modern Languages</em> was established in 1853.
To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university 1456&#x2014;1856, the &quot;Rubenow-Denkmal&quot; (Rubenow Monument) was built in front of the main building, which is still there at its historic place.
The <em>Department of History</em> was founded 1863 as the first in Prussia and the fourth in all of Germany.
The painter <a>Caspar David Friedrich</a> was born in Greifswald and received his first painting instruction by one of the university's members.
Today the <em>Department of Fine Art and Art History</em> is named after him.
He later painted several oil paintings with motifs from the region, including the one one the left.</p>
<p>The spectrum of academic research and teaching was further expanded during the <a>Weimar Republic</a>.
The <em>Nordisches Institut</em> (Scandinavian and <a>Finno-Ugric</a> studies) and several other research institutes, e.g. for biological research, Christian archeology, and Palestinian studies, were founded.</p>
<p>It was named after <a>Ernst Moritz Arndt</a> in 1933, who was a student of theology in 1791 and later taught history at Greifswald.
Here, he published his works &quot;<em>Versuch einer Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft in Pommern und R&#x00fc;gen</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Germanien und Europa</em>&quot; as well as the first part of &quot;<em>Geist der Zeit</em>&quot;.
<p><a>thumb|University of Greifswald, Old Campus</a> <a>thumb|upright|The main building on 8 October 1956, a few days before the 500th anniversary celebrations of the university</a> All academic activities came to a halt towards the end of the <a>Second World War</a>, and the university was re-opened on February 15, 1946.
Several organisational changes were made during the time of the <a>GDR</a>, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the <a>German Reunification</a>.
Freedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established.
The Faculty of Law and Economics was re-opened from 1991 to 1993.
The dinosaur <a>Emausaurus</a> was named after the acronym of the university (<em>E</em>rndt-<em>M</em>oritz-<em>A</em>rndt-<em>U</em>niversit&#x00e4;t Greifswald) in 1990.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1999, the University of Greifswald was among the first in Germany to welcome and introduce the international <a>Bachelor</a>/<a>Master</a> degree system as proposed by the <a>Bologna declaration</a>.
The new system has replaced all former 4.5 year &quot;Magister&quot; degrees in the arts and humanities and is set to replace the 4.5 year &quot;Diplom&quot; formerly awarded in the sciences and in business too.</p>
The central ceremony &#x2014; involving the re-opening of the university's renovated administrative building by President <a>Horst K&#x00f6;hler</a> of Germany, <a>Queen Silvia of Sweden</a>, and Minister President <a>Harald Ringstorff</a> of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern &#x2014; took place on October 17, 2006.</p>
<p>Since the end of the <a>GDR</a> the University of Greifswald has undergone major construction efforts.
Between 1991 and 2007, more than 417 million <a>Euro</a>s were spent on the careful renovation of historic buildings, as well as on the construction of new sites.
A new campus for natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city.
The new domiciles of <a>Greifswald University Library</a>, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed.
The university hospital, which is thought to be completed in 2009, will be the most up-to-date full-scalee hospital in Germany, adding to the appeal of the <a>Greifswald Medical School</a>.
As one of only 17 out of a total of 52 proposed building projects of &quot;national significance&quot; across Germany, the national government has agreed to subsidise the construction of a new <a>pharmacology</a> research lab (in Germany, education is usually cared for by the <a>German states</a> and not by the national government, which only supports a few projects of national and international importance).</p>
<p><a>thumb|The <em>Universit&#x00e4;tshauptgeb&#x00e4;ude</em> &#x2014; the seat of the rector and the administration</a></p>
<p>The rectorate, consisting of the <a>rector</a> two vice rectors, and the chancellor, represents the university as a whole, sets the main guidelines development, distributes the finances, opens and cloeses study programmes, and appoints professors.
The chancellor is the head of the university administration, and manages the university's budget.
<p>The senate is the second governing institution of the university.
The senate elects the rectorate, and is itself elected by the members of the university, i.e. by students and staff.
<p>Moreover, there is a university council (<em>Universit&#x00e4;tsrat</em>), consisting of six prominent members of the public who are elected by the senate to advise the university in various ways.</p>
<p>The physics department of the University of Greifswald, together with the <a>Max-Planck-Institut f&#x00fc;r Plasmaphysik</a> and the <a>Leibniz Institute of Plasma Research and Technology</a>, is a major international research hub in the field of <a>plasma physics</a>, attempting to solve future energy problems with the research reactor <a>Wendelstein 7-X</a>.
<p>Since 2007, the Department of Physics takes care of the construction of a <a>space telescope</a> called <em>MuSTAnG</em> (Muon Spaceweather Telescope for Anisotropies at Greifswald), which will be part of a worldwide network of telescopes in Japan, Brazil, Australia and Germany.
The telescope will enable psysicists and astrononomists at Greifswald University to forecast <a>solar activity</a> and has been co-funded by the <a>European Space Agency</a> (ESA) and the <a>Deutsches Zentrum f&#x00fc;r Luft- und Raumfahrt</a>.
In addition to MuSTAnG, the university owns an <a>observatory</a>, which is taken care of by a private initiative and open to the public.</p>
<p>Greifswald offers two multi-disciplinary approaches to environmental studies, called <a>landscape ecology</a> and environmental sciences bringing together different disciplines such as biology, geography, economics, law, and ethics.</p>
The government-funded National Research Centre for <a>Animal Disease</a> on the Isle of <a>Riems</a> co-operates loosely with the university and is named <em>Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut</em> in honour of the university's former member of staff, <a>Friedrich Loeffler</a>.
<p>The University of Greifswald owns an ornithological station on the German island <a>Hiddensee</a>.</p>
<p>The faculty of theology was founded when the university was founded in 1456.
Notable theologians have studied or worked here, for example <a>Johannes Bugenhagen</a> who was a close friend of Martin Luther.</p>
<p>[[File:EMAU - Unibibliothek.jpg|thumb|The new library is one of the constituent buildings of [[Greifswald University Library]].]]
<a>Greifswald University Library</a> traces its roots back to the year 1456.
In 1604, the first centralised university library in Germany was founded in Greifswald.
The &quot;winter term&quot; (<em>Wintersemester</em>) lasts from October to March, and the &quot;summer term&quot; (<em>Sommersemester</em>) from April to September.
During the winter term, teaching usually takes place from mid-October to the end of January &#x2014; the remainder being reserved for exams and the writing of term papers.
Teaching during the summer term lasts from mid-April to mid-July.</p>

<p>The University of Greifswald aims to extend and efficiently use its international contacts.
The primary geographic focus of international collaboration is <a>Northern Europe</a> and <a>Eastern Europe</a>, which is due to the university's research focus in this area.
<p>Student exchange from and to Greifswald is co-ordinated by the university's international office (<em></em>).
In Northern Europe, the university has signed partnership agreements with universities in Denmark (<a>&#x00c5;rhus</a>, Holb&#x00e6;k), Estonia (<a>Tartu</a>), Finland (<a>Helsinki</a>), Latvia (<a>Riga</a>), Lithuania (<a>Vilnius</a>, <a>Klaipeda</a>) and Sweden (<a>Lund</a>).
In Eastern Europe, partnership agreements have been signed with universities in the Czech Republic (<a>Brno</a>), Poland (<a>Poznan</a>, Szczecin), and Russia (<a>Kaliningrad</a>, <a>Saint Petersburg</a>).
An exceptions are the <a>University of Aberdeen</a> as one of the <a>ancient universities of Scotland</a>, and the <a>University of Padua</a> in Italy.
The university has also signed various cooperation agreements with universities outside of Europe, e.g. the <a>University of South Australia</a>, the <a>University of Newcastle, Australia</a> the <a>University of Manitoba</a> and the <a>University of Saskatchewan</a> (Canada), the <a>National University of Singapore</a> (humanities) or <a>Berkeley</a> (humanities) and the <a>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> (United States).</p>
There is an annual &quot;children's university&quot; week as well as a family university, in which current trends in research are presented in a more popular form.
Every semester, the student union organises a &quot;24 hour lecture&quot;, in which many researchers of the university present interesting topics in short lectures starting at 6pm on a Friday, and ending at 6pm on the following Saturday.</p>

The University of Greifswald was a large scale land owner until post-<a>World War II</a> communist land reforms.
It owned more than 140 square kilometres of arable land, the revenue of which was the basis for its financial independence and wealth.
It was one of the wealthiest universities in Germany.
<p>The former financial independence of the university can still be seen in many historic buildings as well as a notable collection of art and other possessions.
The university has some its artworks and possessions on display in museums across the country.
<a>Ernst Bogislaw von Cro&#x00ff;</a> donated the <a>Croy Tapestry</a>, a tapestry depicting the Reformation from 1554.
The university also owns one of only four remaining 36-line <a>Gutenberg</a> Bibles from the year 1458.
The University of Greifswald runs <a>Greifswald Botanic Garden</a>.

<li>History of Medicine Collection (<em>Medizinhistorische Sammlung</em>)</li>
<li>Collection of Physics Appliances (<em>Physikalische Ger&#x00e4;tesammlung</em>)</li>
<p>Moreover, the University of Greifswald is frequently described as one of the most popular universities for undergraduate admission in Germany, which is due to a very good study environment as well as a co-operative spirit between faculty and students.
<p>The University of Greifswald can look back at a long tradition of academic excellence and international collaboration, which reaches back to 1436, when the first teaching began.
As one of the oldest universities in Germany, it reached a peak in terms of wealth and reputation in the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century, which was, however, set back by two World Wars (1914&#x2013;1918, 1939&#x2013;1945) and the Communist education doctrine and private ownership reforms of the former <a>East Germany</a> (1945&#x2013;1990).
Today, the university aspires to take back its old place among the world's universities, and has both strengthened its long traditions and welcomed new trends and innovations.
According to a 2008 study, Greifswald is Germany's 'youngest city', having the highest percentage of households by people under 30 years of age.
Two thirds of the enrolled students in 2009 came to Greifswald from outside the state of <a>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a>, and 5.3 percent were foreign nationals.</p>
<p>The city of <a>Greifswald</a> has several museums, a theatre and a philharmonic orchestra as well as a breadth of sports clubs and societies.
[[Ryck]] river is a popular place for rowing, canoeing, and angling.
The path on the southern side of the river is good for walking, cycling, or jogging from the city centre to the seaside area, <em>Wieck</em>, and vice versa.]]
The university's <em>Hochschulsport</em> offers a wide range of opportunities to students who wish to do sports.
<p>Greifswald is situated near the sea and the area between isles of <a>R&#x00fc;gen</a> and <a>Usedom</a> is among the most picturesque and best sailing and yachting regions in the whole of Germany.
It hosts the annual <em>Moritz Golf Cup</em>.</p>
<p>Popular desitinations for water- and beach-related activities during the summer are the nearby spa towns on the isles of <a>R&#x00fc;gen</a> and <a>Usedom</a>, e.g.
The coast of <a>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a> is one of the most popular summer tourist destinations in Germany.
The <em>Stadtpark</em> (city park) is situated to the northeast of the city centre next to a small zoo.
The <em>Ryck</em> river crosses the city, and is only a 2 minute walk from the central market square.
<p><a>center|thumb|700px|The historic market square with its pubs, caf&#x00e9;s, and restaurants &#x2014; the core of the city centre &#x2014; is a popular place on a sunny day.</a></p>
In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market.
However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.</p>
<p>The <a>AStA</a> and the student parliament (<em>StuPa</em>) work to represent the interests of all students towards the university and society as a whole.
It comprises lectures, movies, theatre performances, live jazz music, fine art and literature.</p>
<p>There is a monthly student magazine called <em>moritz-Magazin</em>, which read by the majority of students and publishes stories not only about university politics but also about culture in general.
A popular <em>radio98eins</em> local/regional radio station is operated mainly by students and presents independent music and local news.
As traditional symbols (<a>couleur</a>) corporation members wear coloured caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional <a>academic fencing</a>, a kind of duel, in order to &quot;shape their members for the challenges of life&quot;.
Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students.
Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life.</p>

The University of Greifswald is associated with a number of notable people, including both former students and faculty.
<p><a>Johannes Stark</a> (1874&#x2013;1957) received the <a>Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1919 (see <a>Nobel Prize Website</a>) &quot;for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields&quot; during his time at the University of Greifswald.
In 1939, <a>Gerhard Domagk</a> (1895&#x2013;1964) received the <a>Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> (see <a>Nobel Prize Website</a>) &quot;for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil&quot;.
The university was named in honour of its former student and faculty member, the writer, politician und poet <a>Ernst Moritz Arndt</a>.
<a>Otto von Bismarck</a>, chancellor of the <a>German Empire</a> from 1871&#x2013;1890 and the &quot;engineer&quot; of the <a>Unification of Germany</a> in 1871, had a connection to Greifswald when he studied at the agricultural college, as well as one of his successors, Prince <a>Bernhard von B&#x00fc;low</a>, who was chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909.
<p><a>Franz Seldte</a>, a chemist by profession, worked as German labour minister.
<a>Johannes Bugenhagen</a>, who introduced the Reformation in much of Northern Germany and Scandinavia was a student at the University of Greifswald and <a>Thomas Thorild</a>, a <a>Swedish</a> poet spent parts of his life in Greifswald.
