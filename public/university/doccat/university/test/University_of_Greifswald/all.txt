established$$$@@@%%%<p>Founded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436), it is one of the <a>oldest universities</a> in Europe, with generations of notable <a>alumni and staff</a> having studied or worked in Greifswald.
established$$$@@@%%%As the <a>fourth-oldest</a> university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of <a>Sweden</a> (1648&#x2013;1815) and <a>Prussia</a> (1815&#x2013;1945), respectively.
students$$$@@@%%%Approximately two thirds of the 12,000 students are from outside the <a>state</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the <a>alma mater</a> across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a &quot;university with a town built around it&quot; rather than a town with a university.

country$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|Map of medieval universities in Europe.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|left|upright|The foundation of the university took place at Saint Nicolas' Cathedral.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Up to this day, a number of university events take place in the Greifswald's largest church, <em>Dom St. Nikolai</em>.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%The University of Greifswald was founded on October 17, 1456 with the approval of the <a>Holy Roman Empire</a> and the <a>Pope</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of <a>Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania</a> and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral.
established$$$@@@%%%The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by <a>Caspar David Friedrich</a> and his brother and can still be visited today.
established$$$@@@%%%The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the <a>University of Rostock</a> (founded 1419).
type$$$@@@%%%Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In Germany, there are only three <a>older universities</a> by count of the years of existence: the <a>University of Heidelberg</a> (established 1386), the <a>University of Leipzig</a> (1409), and the <a>University of Rostock</a> (1419).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>International co-operation with other institutions of higher education in <a>northern Europe</a> existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network <a>Hanse</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from <a>Scandinavia</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This was a relatively high percentage compared to the total number of students at the time.
established$$$@@@%%%Sources suggest a relatively segregated life of Swedish students in the primarily German university though.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%The early sixteenth century saw significant co-operation of the university, the <a>Lutheran</a> church, the city and the Duchy of Pomerania.
established$$$@@@%%%Professors of theology simultaneously served as pastors in the three cathedrals.
established$$$@@@%%%Professors of medicine usually served as personal physicians of the duke.
established$$$@@@%%%Professors of law where also working at the local courts while professors of the faculty of philosophy usually taught the sons and daughters of the ducal family.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The landed nobility also funded university-related purposes such as scholarships and student bursaries.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%After the secularisation of the monastery at <a>Eldena</a> near Greifswald, Duke Philipp I of <a>Pomerania</a> gave all revenue created by the now secularised <em><a>Amt</a> Eldena</em> to the university.
established$$$@@@%%%His successor, Duke <a>Ernst Ludwig</a>, began the construction of a college building, which could only be completed after his death.
established$$$@@@%%%Duke <a>Philipp Julius</a> presented the university a <a>gown</a> that was used by the rector on ceremonial occasions up until very recently.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1604, the <a>Greifswald University Library</a> became the first centralised <a>university library</a> in Germany.
established$$$@@@%%%The university signed a contract with a book printer from <a>Wittenberg</a>, Germany, for the amount of 2,000 <a>Gulden</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This contract lasted nearly a century due to the disruption caused by the <a>Thirty Years' War</a> (1618&#x2013;1648).
type$$$@@@%%%Hence, the university now owns prestigious early prints of authors and printers such as <a>Johannes Gutenberg</a> or <a>Thomas Thorild</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The phrase <em><a>cuius regio, eius religio</a></em> as applied to the outcome of the <a>Protestant Reformation</a> is attributed to the early seventeenth century jurist Joachim Stephani (1544&#x2013;1623) of the University of Greifswald.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Duke of Pomerania was in financial troubles and had not paid the professors.
established$$$@@@%%%As a solution, he gave the Amt Eldena to the university - a total of 140 square kilometres of land.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>After the <a>Peace of Westphalia</a> in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, came under <a>Swedish control</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815.
established$$$@@@%%%Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first university course in the <a>English language</a> in Germany was held in Greifswald in the year 1777.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%The <em>Nordisches Institut</em> (Scandinavian and <a>Finno-Ugric</a> studies) and several other research institutes, e.g. for biological research, Christian archeology, and Palestinian studies, were founded.</p>
