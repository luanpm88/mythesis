<h2>History</h2>
<p>Both <a>Alfred University</a> and Alfred State College have their roots in an early teaching college called the Alfred Select School.
This school, under the leadership of the Seventh-Day Baptist church, was visionary in its equal opportunity policy.
In 1908 President <a>Boothe C. Davis</a> of Alfred University persuaded the New York State legislature to locate the New York State School of Agriculture at the Alfred University Campus; the resulting allocation of $75,000 for three buildings, a farm, livestock, and machinery would set plans for the school in motion.
<p>In 1948 the enrollment grew to such large numbers that the state government decided to allow it room to expand, moving the school across Main street from Alfred University, where it remains today.
In addition to a new campus would come greater autonomy, meaning that Alfred would now have two state-funded schools and one private university.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alfred State College and its neighbor <a>Alfred University</a> entered into merger talks that were eventually abandoned in the face of opposition from students, faculty, and alumni from both institutions, many of whom viewed the missions of the two colleges as largely incongruous.</p>
<p>Alfred State College offers more than 70 majors in the arts, applied technology, and management and engineering technology.

<p>In 1972 two students, Mark O'Meara and Eric &quot;Rick&quot; Vaughn, started a charity festival entitled &quot;<a>Hot Dog Day</a>&quot;.
This festival was to be a charity fundraiser for the area and would focus on the <a>hot dog</a>.
Now held in the third weekend of April, <a>Hot dog day</a> is a yearly celebration coordinated through both <a>Alfred University</a> and Alfred State College.
<p>Beginning in <a>Fall</a> 2008, Alfred State College will be hosting an annual <a>Homecoming</a> celebration, which will be held in part at the soon to be completed athletic complex.
