established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Institute on the Common Good</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|100px|DeSmet Hall.</a> <a>thumb|right|200px|Carroll Hall from the garden to the north.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1997, by Father Michael J. Sheeran, S.J, the <a>Institute</a> on the <a>Common Good</a> through practices of Regis University in matters of <a>dialogue</a>, <a>discernment</a>, and democratic <a>deliberation</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Institute on the Common Good believes that because of the diversity inherent in the world, focusing on only one specific model or technique for resolving community issues will not allow those communities to build trust and strong relationships nor to develop innovative solutions to challenges faced by those communities.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Rigid processes themselves can be deadly to effective dialogue and relationships.
type$$$@@@%%%As a result, the Institute does not identify a specific set of techniques or steps for its work, but rather attempts to establish a climate or ethos within which the dialogue happens.
established$$$@@@%%%The Institute on the Common Good&#x2019;s Transformational Dialogue emerges from roots deep within Ignatius of Loyola&#x2019;s (and the Jesuit&#x2019;s) philosophy underlying communal discernment.
established$$$@@@%%%We continue to build on these roots using some of the latest research in the emerging field of dialogue.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition, the Institute seeks to provide the student body with world-renowned speakers as a fresh avenue of education.
state$$$@@@%%%Examples of such speakers include:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
country$$$@@@%%%  <li>Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,</li>
head_label$$$@@@%%%  <li>President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica,</li>

image_size$$$@@@%%%  <li>Elizabeth Dole, former President of the American Red Cross and U.S. Senator,</li>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%  <li>Sister Helen Prejean, Author of Dead Man Walking.</li>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</ul>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A leading example of <a>social justice</a> in action, the Institute is a prime example of the Jesuit motto of &#x201c;men and women for others.&#x201d;</p>

vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%  <li>Somaly Mam, Cambodian anti-trafficking proponent.
established$$$@@@%%%Today, the Institute continues to grow and integrate dialogue, discernment and democratic deliberation into the community practice of Regis University.</li>
