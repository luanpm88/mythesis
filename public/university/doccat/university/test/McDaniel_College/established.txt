<p>McDaniel College is one of 40 colleges profiled in the book <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em> by <a>Loren Pope</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was founded in 1867 as <strong>Western Maryland College</strong>, and was named for the <a>Western Maryland Railroad</a> because the college's first Board chairman, John Smith of Wakefield, was also the president of the railroad.
(Neither the railroad nor the Methodist Protestant Church contributed funds to facilitate the establishment of the college.
Some contributions, however, were received from Methodist Protestant laymen, including John Smith.)
It had a voluntary fraternal affiliation with the Methodist Protestant (later United Methodist) Church from 1868 until 1974; the adjacent but separate institution, the Westminster Theological Seminary,  was a principal site for training Methodist Protestant (later United Methodist) clergy in the Maryland region.
The ties with the United Methodist Church were cut over a court case in which Western Maryland and other religiously affiliated schools in Maryland were being challenged over state funding received by the colleges because of their religious ties.
<p>The college's first building went up in 1867, with an inaugural class of 37 men and women.
Western Maryland was the first coeducational institution south of the Mason-Dixon Line and was among the first in the nation.
However, Western Maryland College was primarily a school without minority race representation until the 1960s.</p>
<p><a>Baker Memorial Chapel</a> was dedicated April 20, 1958.
The organ in the new chapel has been given by two alumni, father and son, Roger J. Whiteford, a prominent Washington attorney and graduate in 1906, and his son <a>Joseph S. Whiteford</a> a graduate in 1943, president of the <a>Aeolian-Skinner</a> Organ Company, Boston, Mass.
The Chapel steeple, 113 feet tall, is visible for miles around and was originally topped by a stainless steel cross 6 feet in height.
The wood panels of the chancel have been designed to complement the antique organ console which was originally in the <a>Bruton Parish Church</a>, at <a>Williamsburg</a>, <a>Virginia</a>.
The organ, with its 2,310 pipes, is held to be the largest in the area.
The Whitefords also gave the <a>carillon</a> installed in the steeple.</p>
<p>McDaniel College Budapest (formerly known as Western Maryland College Budapest) was established in collaboration with <strong>College International Budapest</strong> in 1994.
McDaniel College is also home to the summer training camp of the <a>Baltimore Ravens</a> <a>NFL</a> team.
The Ravens live in the Best Western near the College Square Shopping Center during training.
On January 11, 2002, the trustees announced their unanimous decision to change the name of the college.
On July 1, 2002, WMC officially became McDaniel College, honoring alumnus <a>William Roberts McDaniel</a> and his 65-year association with the school.
The naming process during the spring of 2002 included input from students, faculty and alumni about possible names.
On January 12, 2007, the college suffered a tragic loss when its second-year men's basketball coach, Bob Flynn, died of a massive heart attack at his home in Catonsville, Maryland, at the age of 49.
Flynn had guided McDaniel to a 7-6 record through the first two months of the 2006-07 season, its best start in two decades.</p>
<p>McDaniel College is a liberal arts school that is founded on having many majors to pick from.
McDaniel in 2002 created the McDaniel Plan, which was the first of its kind, and it is renowned nationally for its innovative way of grasping the students to make education their own.</p>
The requirements of The McDaniel Plan applies to all first-year students who enroll in college for the Bachelor of Arts degree.
The redesign of the general education curriculum, The McDaniel Plan, emphasizes intellectual skills that will be crucial to graduates.
The focus of The McDaniel Plan is to make studies incorporate critical thinking, cogent writing, analytic reading, persuasive public speaking, effective collaboration, the ability to adapt to change and bridge cultural differences.</p>
