established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumbnail|left|1871 Poster for Sewanee</a> On July 4, 1857, delegates from ten <a>dioceses</a> of the <a>Episcopal Church</a> &#x2014; <a>Alabama</a>, <a>Arkansas</a>, <a>Florida</a>, <a>Georgia</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, <a>Mississippi</a>, <a>North Carolina</a>, <a>South Carolina</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>, and <a>Texas</a> &#x2014; were led up Monteagle mountain by Bishop <a>Leonidas Polk</a> for the founding of their denominational college for the region.
established$$$@@@%%%The six-ton marble cornerstone, laid on October 10, 1860 and consecrated by Bishop Polk, was blown up in 1863 by Union soldiers from an <a>Illinois</a> regiment; many of the pieces were collected and kept as keepsakes by the soldiers.
established$$$@@@%%%At least a few were donated back to the University, and a large fragment was eventually installed in a wall of All Saints' Chapel, where the relic can be visited by pilgrims.
established$$$@@@%%%Several figures later prominent in the <a>Confederacy</a>, notably Bishop-General <a>Leonidas Polk</a>, Bishop Stephen Elliott, and Bishop <a>James Hervey Otey</a>, were significant founders of the University.
established$$$@@@%%%Generals <a>Edmund Kirby Smith</a>, <a>Josiah Gorgas</a> and <a>Francis A. Shoup</a> were prominent in the University's postbellum revival and continuance.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Because of the damage and disruptions of the <a>Civil War</a>, construction came to a temporary halt around that time.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1866 the process was resumed, and this date is sometimes given as the re-founding of the <a>University</a> and the point from which it has maintained continuous operations (though official materials and anniversary celebrations use 1857 as the founding year).
established$$$@@@%%%The University's first convocation was held on September 18, 1868, with nine students and four faculty members present.
established$$$@@@%%%After the Civil War, <a>Robert E. Lee</a> was offered the position of Vice-Chancellor but declined, choosing instead to work at <a>Washington College</a> in his native Virginia.
established$$$@@@%%%The Rt. Rev. Charles Todd Quintard, Vice Chancellor of the University (Second Bishop of Tennessee and &quot;Chaplain of the Confederacy&quot;) journeyed to the first Lambeth Conference in England (1868) and received financial support from clergy and laity of the Church of England which enabled the rebuilding of the school.
established$$$@@@%%%He is known as the &quot;Re-Founder&quot; of the University of the South.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Schools of dentistry, engineering, law, medicine, and nursing once existed, and a secondary school was part of the institution well into the second half of the twentieth century.
established$$$@@@%%%For financial reasons, however, it was eventually decided to focus on two schools which exist today, the College and the School of Theology.
established$$$@@@%%%In June 2006, Sewanee opened its School of Letters, a second graduate school.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The School of Letters offers an M.A. in American Literature and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Buildings</h2>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>The Sewanee campus includes many buildings constructed of various materials faced with local stone, most done in the <a>Gothic</a> style.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li><strong>All Saints' Chapel</strong> was originally designed by <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a> and began construction in 1904 (replacing the smaller, wooden St. Augustine's Chapel which stood nearby), but the financial panic of 1907 left the University without the funds to complete it.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%It was completed in 1959 to a design by then-Vice Chancellor Edward McCrady.</li>

affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>:Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%McCrady was also responsible for the connection of the buildings of the original quadrangle with cloisters.

nickname$$$@@@%%%McCrady was determined to fill in the plain windows of All Saints' Chapel with stained glass, though many remained without for several years.

established$$$@@@%%%The final window was installed in 2004, nearly 100 years after construction began on the Chapel.</p>

vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<h2>&quot;Name change&quot;</h2>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>The institution has combined its two historical names in all University publications that are not official documents and bills itself as &quot;Sewanee: The University of the South.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The Sewanee <em>Graphics Identity Standards Manual,</em> a document reflecting the official policies of the university with respect to its public image, states, in part: </p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>:First, it must be understood that the official and legal name of this institution is &#x201c;The University of the South.&#x201d;
nickname$$$@@@%%%In the past, though, unorganized use of this official name and the University&#x2019;s familiar name, Sewanee, has been confusing to those unfamiliar with the institution.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, college guides and Web sites that have become so crucial in young people&#x2019;s college searches may list the institution under as many as four different entries&#x2014;beginning with &quot;The,&quot; &quot;University,&quot; &quot;South,&quot; or &quot;Sewanee.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>:To avoid confusion and to honor the history and character of the institution, a consistent reference to the name of the institution is critical.
established$$$@@@%%%So, for extended audiences unfamiliar with the institution, the naming convention &quot;Sewanee: The University of the South&quot; should be used on a first reference.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Subsequent references may be to &quot;Sewanee&quot; or &quot;the University.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When this naming system was proposed in 2004, it was misinterpreted by some alumni to reflect a change in the official name of the University.
established$$$@@@%%%A minor scandal ensued, due in large part to insinuations that the change was intended to &quot;distance&quot; the University from its historic association with Southern culture.
established$$$@@@%%%The controversy has generally subsided, though some students and alumni still mistakenly refer to the incident as a &quot;name change&quot;.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Literary associations</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school has long been known for its literary associations.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em><a>Sewanee Review</a></em>, founded in 1892, is thought to be the longest-running literary magazine in the country and has published and been praised by many distinguished authors.
established$$$@@@%%%Its success has helped launch the <a>Sewanee Writers' Conference</a>, held each summer.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1983, playwright and <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winner <a>Tennessee Williams</a> left his literary rights to the University of the South.
established$$$@@@%%%Royalties have helped build the Tennessee Williams Center, a performance venue and teaching facility, and to create the Tennessee Williams teaching fellowships, which bring well-known figures in the arts to the campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><em>&quot;Ecce quam bonum et quam iucundum habitare fratres in unum,&quot;</em>  the University's motto, is taken from the opening of <a>Psalm</a> 133:  &quot;Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to  dwell together in unity.&quot;</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Environmental sustainability</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the fall of 2008, the University of the South made a public commitment to environmental sustainability during its Sustainability Week, which featured speakers, feasts of local foods, and environmentally themed documentaries.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Sewanee campus is also home to a EcoHouse and residence halls compete in the Eco-Cup competition each year in an attempt to reduce their energy consumption.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2007, the University of the South became a signatory to the Presidents Climate Commitment.
established$$$@@@%%%The university received a C- on the College Sustainability Report Card.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Institutional traditions</h2>
motto$$$@@@%%%<p>The school is rich in distinctive traditions, many of which are tied to Southern culture.
nickname$$$@@@%%%For example, male students have always worn coats and ties to classes&#x2014;this tradition has generally been continued, though the coat and tie are often combined with casual pants and, sometimes, shorts.
type$$$@@@%%%Faculty and student members of the primary honor society and main branch of student government, the Order of Gownsmen, wear <a>academic gown</a>s to teach or attend class&#x2014;perhaps the last vestige of this historically <a>English</a> practice in North America.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Similarly, drinking clubs, including <em>The Highlanders</em> and <em>The Wellingtons</em>, <em>The Beefeaters</em>, <em>Los Peones</em> and ribbon societies continue to thrive after many decades.
nickname$$$@@@%%%At major events, members of the former two groups display their distinctive ceremonial garb, kilts and cloaks, respectively.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%The Vice-Chancellor on formal occasions assumes the <em>cappa clausa</em> <a>cope</a> as the Vice-Chancellor at <a>Cambridge University</a> still does.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Modern traditions include the Festival of Lessons and Carols in early December, an imitation of the traditional Christmas service in <a>Cambridge</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Also, local mythology regarding <a>angels</a> is abundant; residents of the Domain tap the roofs of their cars as they pass through the stone gates in order to &quot;get their angel&quot; for protection in their travels.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Numerous other traditions continue to flourish on the Mountain, many adapted to fit modern practices.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In recent years, some alumni and students have perceived that the school was trying to downplay the university's traditions, particularly its historical and cultural ties with Southern culture.
faculty$$$@@@%%%As a result, some traditions have come under special scrutiny.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Mace controversy</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>One particular concern was the disappearance of a ceremonial baton, called a &quot;<a>mace</a>,&quot; dedicated to <a>Nathan Bedford Forrest</a> and decorated with Confederate-themed marks and images.
established$$$@@@%%%The mace has been controversial due to its association with Forrest and its implications for attitudes toward <a>African-Americans</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Forrest had no connection with the university;&lt;ref name=&quot;Finder&quot;/&gt; the mace had been commissioned in 1964 by Louise Claiborne-Armstrong, whose brother attended the university, and made by San Francisco jewelry firm Shreve and Company using several of Claiborne-Armstrong's most precious jewels, notably a blue/white  <a>diamond</a> which sat in the center cross atop the mace.
established$$$@@@%%%The rest of the mace consisted of solid <a>silver</a> except for the band, which was solid <a>gold</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was officially donated to the University in 1965, and was carried by the Order of Gownsmen at academic processions until it &quot;disappeared&quot; in 1997.
established$$$@@@%%%Religion professor Gerald L. Smith said he had accidentally broken the mace while viewing it for an alumnus, and history professor Samuel R. Williamson, who was then chief executive, said he had already commissioned a new one.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. Smith said a misunderstanding led to the mace's disappearance; he had asked the <a>campus police</a> chief to put it in a vault for safekeeping, but it was instead placed in the police station's gun vault, where it was found in early 2005.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Upon its discovery, over 30 alumni offered to pay for the mace's repair but the University refused their offer.&lt;ref
established$$$@@@%%%name=&quot;Finder&quot;/&gt; The mace is now available for private viewing via the school's archives.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>University hymn and alma mater</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><em>The University Hymn</em>, written by Bishop <a>Thomas Frank Gailor</a> (1856&#x2013;1935), is sung to the tune of <em><a>Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser</a></em> (<em>The Emperor's Hymn</em>, known in English language hymnals as &quot;Austria&quot;),  by <a>Joseph Haydn</a>.[<a>http://itw.sewanee.edu/Music111/Works/Haydn/haydn.html</a>]

head_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>School of Theology</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>School of Theology</strong> at the University of the South was founded in 1878.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Originally it was known as &quot;St.
established$$$@@@%%%Luke's&quot; because it was housed in St. Luke's Hall, which was given by Charlotte Morris Manigault to the University specifically for a School of Theology.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the merger of the <a>Sewanee Military Academy</a> with the <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Andrew's School</a>, located a few miles from UTS, in 1981, the School of Theology moved to the former SMA campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Because this new location was a mile away from St. Luke's Chapel (west of the UTS campus proper), seminarians worshiped in a converted classroom until a new chapel was constructed adjacent to the school in 2000.[<a>http://theology.sewanee.edu/cota</a>]</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The School of Theology is one of the eleven seminaries officially connected with the <a>Episcopal Church</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Further, it is the only one located within the Southeastern U.S. proper, the only other Southern seminaries being located at geographical fringes of the region, <a>Virginia Theological Seminary</a> near <a>Washington, D.C.</a> and the <a>Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest</a> in <a>Austin, Texas</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Historically, its position within Anglicanism is generally considered to fall within the parameters of the <a>High Church</a> tradition, whereas Virginia was seen as the seminary in the Low Church tradition.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Sewanee Tigers were pioneers in American intercollegiate athletics and possessed the South's preeminent <a>football</a> program in the 1890s.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Their <a>1899 football team</a> had perhaps the best season in college football history, winning all 12 of their games, 11 by <a>shutout</a>, and outscoring their opponents 322-10.
established$$$@@@%%%Five of those wins, all shutouts, came in a six day period while on a  trip by train.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Ten of their twelve opponents, including all five of their road trip victims, remain major college football powers to this day.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sewanee was a charter member of the <a>Southeastern Conference</a> upon its formation in 1932, but by this time its athletic program had declined precipitously and Sewanee never won a football game in the eight years it was an SEC member.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Sewanee withdrew from the SEC in 1940 and subsequently deemphasized varsity athletics.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Today, Sewanee is a member of the <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> within the <a>NCAA</a>'s non-scholarship <a>Division III</a> and offers 11 varsity sports for men, 13 for women.
