<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>State University of New York</a> College at <a>Cortland</a> was founded in 1848 as the <strong>Cortland Normal School</strong>, which included among its earliest students inventor and industrialist <a>Elmer A. Sperry</a> of <a>Sperry Rand</a> Corp. fame.
It became a full 4-year college in 1868</p>
<p>Over time, the campus continually grew, and in 1941, by an act of legislature and the <a>Board of Regents</a>, the institution officially became a four-year college providing courses leading to the bachelor's degree and soon was widely acknowledged as <em>Cortland State Teachers College</em>.
In 1948, Cortland was a founding member of the State University of New York.</p>
