<p><strong>The College of St. Joseph</strong> is a private, residential, liberal arts Catholic <a>college</a>.
Located on 117 wooded acres in <a>Rutland, Vermont</a>, it is located 15 minutes from the Killington Ski Resort and other outdoor recreational facilities and activities.
<p>The mission of the College of St.
Joseph is to educate &quot;men and women of varied faiths and backgrounds for lives of continuing personal and professional growth, intellectual development, and service to the community.&quot;
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After years of educating their members within the walls of the motherhouse on Convent Avenue in Rutland, the Sisters of St.
Joseph of Rutland purchased the campus of Rutland Junior College to establish a training center for their young novices and continue their education in the sisters&#x2019; normal school.
In 1956, a core group of courageous women lead by Sister Mary Matthew McDevitt, the college&#x2019;s first president, formed St. Joseph&#x2019;s Teacher&#x2019;s College.
To foster the growth of the fledgling college she formed an affiliation with Catholic University of America.</p>
<p>In 1960 the college was approved by the State of Vermont to confer the Bachelor of Science in education and the name of the college was changed to College of St.
That year the first graduation was held and three sisters received their bachelor of science in education.</p>
<p>For 12 years the college served only members of the congregation.
A double trailer was purchased in 1964 and placed near the school building as a residence hall for 8 freshmen.
In May 1965, the first lay students, Michelle Anne Ford and Marita Lillian Peters, graduated from the college in a ceremony held in the Mount St.
The rapid growth of the College resulted in a critical need for both dormitory and classroom space.
In 1967 the first dormitory, Roncalli Hall, was completed.
Joseph Hall was completed with 8 classrooms, 2 science laboratories, a language laboratory and an auditorium/gymnasium.  Continued growth resulted in the need for a second dormitory and in 1969 Medaille Hall was completed.
In the late sixties, the college attained candidacy in the New England Association of Schools and College, Inc., New England&#x2019;s regional accrediting body.</p>
<p>Under Sr. Imelda&#x2019;s administration, the College became co-ed in the fall of 1971 and enrolled six male students.
She also introduced men&#x2019;s basketball to student services in 1972 and moved the educational programs forward to include programs in special education, early childhood education, library science and the master&#x2019;s degree in education.
Under her administration, academic programs in business administration, human services, and liberal studies were added to the CSJP curriculum.
<p>In 1983, the board of trustees appointed the first lay president in the history of the college, Frank Miglorie.
Miglorie had served as a full-time faculty member at the college for nine years and as its Academic Dean for four years under Sr. Mary Polworth.
The board also made another significant change in 1983 when it changed the name of the college to College of St. Joseph.
In May 1993, the Campaign for CSJ was launched.
This was an ambitious 5-year capital campaign that transformed the campus with the addition of two new buildings and the relocation of the library.
The first phase of the Campaign included the construction of the CSJ Athletic Center which was completed in 1995.
<p>The turn of the new century saw refinement of the curriculum and the introduction of new programs.
These efforts to strengthen CSJ were enhanced by growth in the endowment and the creation of strategic alliances with organizations such as Vermont Department of Corrections, the American Red Cross, and Stafford Technical Center.
In addition, efforts also focused on continuing to improve the campus and student services as evidenced by the construction of Giorgetti Library which opened in January 2006 thereby completing a ten-year, $8,000,000 expansion program called ACCESS XXI.</p>
<p>As the College of St.
Joseph moved into the start of the next fifty years of its history,  several new programs were added in response to state and national needs &#x2013; undergraduate and graduate programs in alcohol and substance abuse counseling and an undergraduate program in criminal justice.
Additionally, the college has formed an alliance with Vermont Student Assistance Corporation and the Vermont Department for Children and Families to offer a unique program to assist foster youth transition to college.
Since the fall of 2008, the CSJ STEPS program (Students Taking an Effective Path to Success)  provides year-round housing and support services for foster youth wanting to complete their college education at CSJ.
Our program has already attracted attention from other states also trying to solve the problem of enabling former foster children to earn a college degree and become productive citizens and realize their true potential.</p>
Joseph continues to seek national recognition as a New England Catholic College that transforms its students into leaders who are competent, caring and service-oriented persons and professionals.</p>
<p>The College is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC-CIHE), the State of Vermont Department of Education, the Council of Applied Master's Programs in Psychology and the Board of Psychological Examiners of Vermont.</p>
<p>In 2008 the College purchased the  Clementwood estate from the Sisters of St. Joseph.
Consisting of the Clementwood Mansion, the Carriage House, Avilia Hall, Marion Hall, and St. Francis Hall, these historic buildings on the newly formed West Campus will be remodeled in the coming year to accommodate administrative offices, academic and residential facilities.</p>
<p>The College offers 28 different degree programs in the arts &amp; sciences, business, criminal justice, education, and psychology &amp; human services.</p>
<p>In 2007 the freshman class consisted of 59% men and 41% women.
The racial composition was 96% white, 2% black, 2% Hispanic, 0% Asian, and 0% foreign.</p>
<p>The College offers many intramural and recreational activities including basketball, racquetball, softball, volleyball, and flag football.
<p>Rich Ortega, a professional basketball player for the Palestinian Professional Basketball League in Israel, graduated from the College.</p>
