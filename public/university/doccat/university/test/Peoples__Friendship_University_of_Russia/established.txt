It was founded in <a>1960</a> as <strong>Peoples' Friendship University</strong> ().
Its stated objective at the time was to help nations of the <a>Third World</a>, mainly in Asia, Africa and South America, at the height of the <a>Cold War</a> by providing higher education and professional training, but many students also attended from the developed countries.</p>
