Founded in 1876, Calvin College is an educational institution of the <a>Christian Reformed Church</a> and stands in the <a>Reformed tradition</a> of <a>Protestantism</a>. Calvin College is named after <a>John Calvin</a>, the 16th century <a>Protestant Reformer</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Christian Reformed Church in North America</a> founded the school on August 4, 1876 as part of <em>Calvin College and Theological Seminary</em> (with the seminary becoming <a>Calvin Theological Seminary</a>) to train church ministers.
It began with seven students enrolled in the first year.
The original location was Spring Street in Grand Rapids, MI.
The initial six-year <a>curriculum</a> included four years of literary studies and two years of <a>theology</a>.
In 1892 the campus was moved to the intersection of Madison Avenue and Franklin Street (Fifth Avenue) in Grand Rapids.
In September, 1894 the school expanded the curriculum for those who were not pre-theological students, making the institution in effect a preparatory school.
A year later Calvin admitted the first women to the school .</p>
<p>In 1906 the literary department of the college became known as <em>John Calvin Junior College</em> and the college held its first commencement .
The next year the college awarded its first bachelor's degree.
In 1924, with the opening of <a>Grand Rapids Christian High School</a>, the college offered its last year of preparatory education, focusing exclusively on higher education and opened its first dormitory.
The next year, the college began offering a teacher training program and in 1926 appointed its first female faculty member, Johanna Timmer, as Dean of Women.
The college dedicated its library, the Hekman Library on March 8, 1928.
The college later dedicated its seminary building at the Franklin Street Campus on October 29, 1930.
Still under the leadership of Rev. Hiemenga the college faced significant trouble during the onset of the Great Depression as financial hardship beset the college.
<p>Although the school grew slowly in its early years, by 1930 it had reached its pre-<a>World War I</a> size of 350-450 students.
By 1950 the enrollment had climbed to 1,270, this same year the college joined the <a>M.I.A.A.</a>.
In 1956, the <a>Synod</a> of the Christian Reformed Church authorized the college to purchase the Knollcrest Farm from J.C. Miller for $400,000 (approximately $2.9million in 2007 dollars).
Originally outside of town in the southeast of Grand Rapids, the Knollcrest farm increased Calvin's campus from approximately one large city block to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;390&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(1.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)&lt;/span&gt; with a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;100&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(0.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)&lt;/span&gt;
Many were reticent about the project and the college's ability to finance it.
The Theological Seminary, since it did not need to be in close proximity to the college, built a new academic building on the site and began holding classes there in 1960.
As space constraints became more noticeable the college built its first academic building on the Knollcrest Campus and held classes there in 1962.
For the next 10 years, the college continued to operate at both the Knollcrest and Franklin campuses, fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973.
During the latter decades of the 20th century, Calvin grew to around 4,200 students, where the enrollment has remained since.
In 1991, the Seminary and the College established separate boards of trustees.</p>
<p>At the turn of the millennium, with enrollment over 4,000 students, Calvin began several new construction projects.
Among these were a new communications and political science building, a conference center and hotel.
In 2006, Calvin announced an expansion of the Fieldhouse which was completed in the spring of 2009 .</p>
<p>The curriculum has expanded to include professional training in a variety of fields, but the college maintains a strong commitment to a liberal arts curriculum, which the college views as a means to develop students' understanding of God's world and their place in it.</p>
<p>The school made national headlines in 2005 when <a>US President</a> <a>George W. Bush</a> served as commencement speaker.
According to the <em><a>Washington Post</a></em>, more than 800 faculty members, alumni, students and friends of the school signed a full-page ad in the <em><a>Grand Rapids Press</a></em>, saying that Bush's policies &quot;...violate many deeply held principles of Calvin College.&quot;
<p>In the summer of 2008, The Capella of Calvin College, the concert choir of Calvin under the direction of professor Joel Navarro, earned two third prizes in the Mixed and Free Category at the 37th Florilege Vocal de Tours Competition in Tours, France.</p>
<p>In August 2009, the College's Board of Trustees issued a controversial memo to all employees that said that faculty were prohibited from teaching, writing about, or advocating on behalf of <a>homosexuality</a> or homosexual issues like <a>same-sex marriage</a>.
Many faculty members were critical of the policy and of the way it was adopted without consultation by the board.
The Faculty Senate rejected the memo overwhelmingly by a vote of 36-4.</p>
<p>In September 2010, the college canceled a concert by <a>Canadian</a> indie rock band, <em><a>The New Pornographers</a>.</em>
According to an official statement released by Calvin, the concert was cancelled after several complaints were made mistakenly associating the band and the college with pornography.</p>
Calvin is a member of the <a>Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a>  and as an institution in the Reformed tradition of Christianity, subscribes to a robust theology that produces a high regard for participating in and forming culture.
<p>Because Calvin is a liberal arts college, it has established a core curriculum with three parts: Gateway, Competencies and Studies, and Capstone.</p>
Prelude introduces students to issues of learning, identity, vocation, discernment, and awareness through discussions and presentations.
Students also take Developing a Christian Mind (DCM), a first-year interim course which introduces the development of a Christian worldview and a faith-based engagement with culture.</p>
The Career Development Office helps to place students in internships and to find vocational callings after graduating.</li>
<li>Honors Program - Calvin has an extensive honors system to challenge students beyond the already academically rigorous courses of the college.
The Honors Program offers a variety of courses, lectures and other challenging activities in and out of the classroom.
Starting in the fall of 2008, Honors students will be able to live on a special floor in one of the residence halls.
<li>Off Campus Programs - Calvin offers ten study off campus programs at locations including <a>England</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>,  <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, <a>Spain</a>, <a>Ghana</a>, <a>Germany</a>, and <a>China</a>.
<li>Interim - Every January, students spend three weeks taking a single course for credit.
Courses have included island hopping in the <a>Gal&#x00e1;pagos</a>, classes on knitting, the music of <a>U2</a>, learning to sail in the Florida Keys and learning about traditional Chinese medicine along with many others.</li>
<p>Located on what was once described as one of the beautiful residential properties in Michigan, many felt the Knollcrest Farm was the perfect place for a college campus.
Calvin acquired the  property in the mid-50s and began a process of turning a biologically diverse farm into a center for Christian higher education.
The master plan for the site was developed by William Beye Fyfe, a strong supporter of <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s <a>prairie style</a> of architecture.
Working with President Spoelhof, Fyfe came up with a set of design principles for the campus aimed to both symbolically represent and physically promote such ideals as the integration of faith and learning; integration of administration, faculty, and students; and the inter-relatedness of all the disciplines.
The integration of knowledge was symbolized in the arrangement of the academic buildings.
The lawn was intended and serves as the common point of interaction between faculty, students, and administration.
The first to be constructed was Hiemenga Hall, named after John Hiemenga and built in 1961.
Hiemenga Hall houses numerous academic departments including modern languages, <a>history</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, classical languages and <a>religion</a>.
<p>The Science Building houses many of the science departments at Calvin, including <a>engineering</a>, <a>physics</a>, <a>astronomy</a>, <a>psychology</a> and <a>nursing</a>.
Calvin is the only institution in which new solar system object discovery is a regular assignment.
The Science Building is also distinctive for having been designed in the shape of a hexagon, emulating the <a>benzene</a> ring.</p>
<p>Built in the mid-1990s, John &quot;Doc&quot; DeVries Hall houses classrooms, faculty offices, research labs and a greenhouse.
In addition to the <a>Biology</a> and <a>Chemistry</a> departments, the building houses the West Michigan Regional Lab, a consortium between the college and local hospital, Spectrum Health.
Attached to DeVries Hall and the Science Building is North Hall, which houses several departments including <a>economics</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>geology</a>, <a>geography</a>, <a>environmental studies</a>, <a>computer science</a>, and <a>mathematics</a>.
The college also has an <a>engineering</a> building housing department offices and project design and construction centers.</p>
Designed around the central auditorium, which seats 1200, the FAC houses the <a>Music</a> and <a>English</a> departments.
At the back of the stage is the 39 rank, 32 stop mechanical action organ built by Schlicker Organs in 1966.
Reflecting the musical heritage of its supporting church, the Christian Reformed Church, the music department has a number of students who study pipe organ performance and play on four pipe instruments in the FAC.
There have been an estimated 18,000 events since its opening.
The auditorium is also equipped with acoustical curtains, a stage lift, three catwalks, and  several separate electrics making the FAC able to handle a wide variety of events from recitals to rock shows.

<p>The Spoelhof Center, named after president emeritus <a>William Spoelhof</a>, houses the <a>art</a>, <a>education</a>, <a>social work</a> and <a>sociology</a> departments, the Office of the President, and several other administrative departments.
The Gezon Auditorium is also housed in the Spoelhof Center.
Like the FAC, it has flexible lighting and sound systems and serves as a venue for concerts, lectures and other events.
On the lower level of the Spoelhof Center, there is an art gallery which hosts a variety of exhibitions.
The Spoelhof Center connects to the Science Building and Hiemenga Hall via underground tunnels.</p>
<p>Across the beltline, the DeVos Communication Center was built in 2002.
The building's upper level houses department and faculty offices for both the political science and communications arts and sciences departments.
Additionally, there is a suite of audiology and speech pathology classrooms and facilities including a working clinic.
The lower level of the building features production facilities such as the Bytwerk Video Theatre, an audio studio, <a>sound stage</a>, control room, and editing suites for audio and video production.
In spring 2007, the college began a $50 million construction project to renovate and expand the Calvin Fieldhouse.
The Hoogenboom Health and Recreation Center contains the original renovated gym that is now used for basketball, volleyball, PE classes, intramurals, and other non-sporting events.
The Hoogenboom also has a dance studio as well as racket ball courts and exercise laboratories.</p>
<p>Since opening in 2009 the Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex has hosted a number of concerts including <a>Lupe Fiasco</a> and <a>Jars of Clay</a> with <a>Thousand Foot Krutch</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1917 with 3,500 volumes, the &quot;library room&quot; eventually became the modern Hekman Library now boasting over 1.8 million volumes.
The collection's emphasis is on collecting works in the traditional liberal arts disciplines.
The library's strongest collections are in <a>Theology</a>, <a>Religion</a>, <a>American literature</a>, <a>British literature</a>, and <a>Philosophy</a>.</p>
The center is a research library specializing in John Calvin and Calvinism.
<p><a>thumb|Calvin College Chapel seen from the Commons Lawn</a></p>
<p>Though always part of the master plan, The Chapel was not built until the late 1980s.
Chapel services follow a daily rhythm with the respective days known as Getting Started, Community Voices, The Word, Sacred Spaces and the very popular Friday SongFest.
While on average, only 500 or so students attend chapel the first four days of the week, Fridays invariably fill the chapel to its 1,000 seat capacity .</p>
<p>Designed by GMB Architects, the chapel sits at the highest point of the academic circle and its spire rises above all of the academic buildings.
Shaped as an octagon, with seating in the round, the Chapel offers exceptional acoustics for both instrumental and vocal music, in addition to the spoken word.
The Chapel also features a large organ built by <a>Dobson Pipe Organ Builders</a>.
<p>A tunnel system connecting to the Spoelhof Center creates an outdoor plaza at ground level and the multi-use Lab Theatre below.
The Lab Theatre is a blackbox theatre built in 1988 as a part of the chapel building project.
The Lab Theatre was built during the chapel construction project.</p>
<p>The Bunker Interpretive Center is a home base for formal programs and an educational resource for the approximately 5,000 casual visitors that the Calvin College Nature Preserve receives annually.
The Bunker Interpretive Center is Gold <a>LEED</a> certified .</p>
<p>Calvin College exerts its right under the <a>Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment</a> to discriminate on the basis of religious criteria in its hiring, personnel practices and admissions.
This has lead Calvin College's employment advertisements to be flagged as discriminatory by the <a>American Philosophical Association</a>.</p>
<p>Calvin has seven residence halls on campus which house the majority of the freshmen and sophomore classes.
<p>  Calvin has a variety of student organizations on campus which provide students with opportunities for involvement as well as leadership development.

It is in some ways a child of the Festival of Faith and Writing that has been taking place at the same institution since the early 90s, and the two events alternate years, but it is organized independently of that event by the Student Activities Office.
<p>Starting out with two small events in 2003 and 2005 (each with 150-200 attendees), the festival grew dramatically and tickets for the 2007 event (over 1000) sold out in advance, due in part to the heightened profile of its headline acts and in part growing word of mouth.</p>
