type$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Calvin College</strong> is a comprehensive <a>liberal arts</a> <a>college</a> located in <a>Grand Rapids</a>, <a>Michigan</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1876, Calvin College is an educational institution of the <a>Christian Reformed Church</a> and stands in the <a>Reformed tradition</a> of <a>Protestantism</a>. Calvin College is named after <a>John Calvin</a>, the 16th century <a>Protestant Reformer</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Christian Reformed Church in North America</a> founded the school on August 4, 1876 as part of <em>Calvin College and Theological Seminary</em> (with the seminary becoming <a>Calvin Theological Seminary</a>) to train church ministers.
established$$$@@@%%%It began with seven students enrolled in the first year.
established$$$@@@%%%The original location was Spring Street in Grand Rapids, MI.
established$$$@@@%%%The initial six-year <a>curriculum</a> included four years of literary studies and two years of <a>theology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1892 the campus was moved to the intersection of Madison Avenue and Franklin Street (Fifth Avenue) in Grand Rapids.
established$$$@@@%%%In September, 1894 the school expanded the curriculum for those who were not pre-theological students, making the institution in effect a preparatory school.
country$$$@@@%%%In 1900 the curriculum further broadened, making it more attractive to students interested in teaching or preparing for preprofessional courses at universities.
established$$$@@@%%%A year later Calvin admitted the first women to the school .</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1906 the literary department of the college became known as <em>John Calvin Junior College</em> and the college held its first commencement .
established$$$@@@%%%The next year the college awarded its first bachelor's degree.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1924, with the opening of <a>Grand Rapids Christian High School</a>, the college offered its last year of preparatory education, focusing exclusively on higher education and opened its first dormitory.
established$$$@@@%%%The next year, the college began offering a teacher training program and in 1926 appointed its first female faculty member, Johanna Timmer, as Dean of Women.
established$$$@@@%%%The college dedicated its library, the Hekman Library on March 8, 1928.
established$$$@@@%%%The college later dedicated its seminary building at the Franklin Street Campus on October 29, 1930.
established$$$@@@%%%Still under the leadership of Rev. Hiemenga the college faced significant trouble during the onset of the Great Depression as financial hardship beset the college.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although the school grew slowly in its early years, by 1930 it had reached its pre-<a>World War I</a> size of 350-450 students.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1950 the enrollment had climbed to 1,270, this same year the college joined the <a>M.I.A.A.</a>.
former_names$$$@@@%%%During this period the college experienced severe space limitations at the land-locked Franklin Campus as enrollment continued to climb .
president$$$@@@%%%Also at this time of growth William Spoelhoef became president of Calvin.
campus$$$@@@%%%At the Franklin campus, the college was located on one large city block.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1956, the <a>Synod</a> of the Christian Reformed Church authorized the college to purchase the Knollcrest Farm from J.C. Miller for $400,000 (approximately $2.9million in 2007 dollars).
established$$$@@@%%%Originally outside of town in the southeast of Grand Rapids, the Knollcrest farm increased Calvin's campus from approximately one large city block to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;390&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(1.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)&lt;/span&gt; with a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;100&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(0.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)&lt;/span&gt;
affiliations$$$@@@%%%nature preserve.
established$$$@@@%%%Many were reticent about the project and the college's ability to finance it.
head_label$$$@@@%%%Under the bold leadership of President Spoelhoef the college made plans to move forward.
established$$$@@@%%%The Theological Seminary, since it did not need to be in close proximity to the college, built a new academic building on the site and began holding classes there in 1960.
established$$$@@@%%%As space constraints became more noticeable the college built its first academic building on the Knollcrest Campus and held classes there in 1962.
established$$$@@@%%%For the next 10 years, the college continued to operate at both the Knollcrest and Franklin campuses, fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973.
established$$$@@@%%%During the latter decades of the 20th century, Calvin grew to around 4,200 students, where the enrollment has remained since.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1991, the Seminary and the College established separate boards of trustees.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the turn of the millennium, with enrollment over 4,000 students, Calvin began several new construction projects.
established$$$@@@%%%Among these were a new communications and political science building, a conference center and hotel.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2006, Calvin announced an expansion of the Fieldhouse which was completed in the spring of 2009 .</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The curriculum has expanded to include professional training in a variety of fields, but the college maintains a strong commitment to a liberal arts curriculum, which the college views as a means to develop students' understanding of God's world and their place in it.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school made national headlines in 2005 when <a>US President</a> <a>George W. Bush</a> served as commencement speaker.
established$$$@@@%%%According to the <em><a>Washington Post</a></em>, more than 800 faculty members, alumni, students and friends of the school signed a full-page ad in the <em><a>Grand Rapids Press</a></em>, saying that Bush's policies &quot;...violate many deeply held principles of Calvin College.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%Some protested by wearing stickers with the phrase &quot;God is not a Republican... or a Democrat&quot; to the commencement.
country$$$@@@%%%The protests have given Calvin a reputation amongst evangelical Christians for having more liberal students and faculty than most evangelical colleges.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the summer of 2008, The Capella of Calvin College, the concert choir of Calvin under the direction of professor Joel Navarro, earned two third prizes in the Mixed and Free Category at the 37th Florilege Vocal de Tours Competition in Tours, France.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In August 2009, the College's Board of Trustees issued a controversial memo to all employees that said that faculty were prohibited from teaching, writing about, or advocating on behalf of <a>homosexuality</a> or homosexual issues like <a>same-sex marriage</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Many faculty members were critical of the policy and of the way it was adopted without consultation by the board.
established$$$@@@%%%The Faculty Senate rejected the memo overwhelmingly by a vote of 36-4.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In September 2010, the college canceled a concert by <a>Canadian</a> indie rock band, <em><a>The New Pornographers</a>.</em>
established$$$@@@%%%According to an official statement released by Calvin, the concert was cancelled after several complaints were made mistakenly associating the band and the college with pornography.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academics</h2>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Calvin College is accredited by the <a>Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a> Calvin offers majors or minors in 115 academic or pre-professional fields.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The most popular majors are business, engineering and nursing.
established$$$@@@%%%Calvin is a member of the <a>Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a>  and as an institution in the Reformed tradition of Christianity, subscribes to a robust theology that produces a high regard for participating in and forming culture.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Core Curriculum</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Because Calvin is a liberal arts college, it has established a core curriculum with three parts: Gateway, Competencies and Studies, and Capstone.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h5>Core: Gateway</h5>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>When students matriculate into Calvin, they begin their studies with a seven-week course known as Prelude.
established$$$@@@%%%Prelude introduces students to issues of learning, identity, vocation, discernment, and awareness through discussions and presentations.
established$$$@@@%%%Students also take Developing a Christian Mind (DCM), a first-year interim course which introduces the development of a Christian worldview and a faith-based engagement with culture.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<h5>Core: Competencies and Studies</h5>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Calvin students are required to take a number of essential classes known as Core Competencies and Core Studies.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Core Competencies, such as written rhetoric, foreign language, and information technology, develop skills essential to success in the academic and professional worlds.
type$$$@@@%%%Core studies courses are designed to introduce students to a variety of disciplines, providing them with a greater understanding of the world and integration of ideas essential to a well-rounded liberal arts education.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Typically a number of Core Competencies and Core Studies courses will overlap with major and minor requirements.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h5>Core: Capstone</h5>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Capstone course, generally taken during the junior or senior year, draws together themes and concepts from the core curriculum and major area of study.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This course  emphasizes taking stock of what students have learned in their time at Calvin and how they can use that knowledge to engage the world and their chosen field.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Other opportunities</h4>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to engaging the world after graduation, Calvin also encourages academic exploration outside of the classroom while still studying at Calvin.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
free_label$$$@@@%%%  <li>Internships - The college has numerous internship opportunities to gain valuable work experience.
established$$$@@@%%%The Career Development Office helps to place students in internships and to find vocational callings after graduating.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%<li>Honors Program - Calvin has an extensive honors system to challenge students beyond the already academically rigorous courses of the college.
established$$$@@@%%%The Honors Program offers a variety of courses, lectures and other challenging activities in and out of the classroom.

city$$$@@@%%%Calvin also partners with numerous other colleges to offer dozens of other off-campus learning opportunities.
city$$$@@@%%%Calvin also offers dozens of off-campus interims as well.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%<li>Interim - Every January, students spend three weeks taking a single course for credit.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Campus</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Located on what was once described as one of the beautiful residential properties in Michigan, many felt the Knollcrest Farm was the perfect place for a college campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Calvin acquired the  property in the mid-50s and began a process of turning a biologically diverse farm into a center for Christian higher education.
established$$$@@@%%%The master plan for the site was developed by William Beye Fyfe, a strong supporter of <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s <a>prairie style</a> of architecture.
established$$$@@@%%%Working with President Spoelhof, Fyfe came up with a set of design principles for the campus aimed to both symbolically represent and physically promote such ideals as the integration of faith and learning; integration of administration, faculty, and students; and the inter-relatedness of all the disciplines.
established$$$@@@%%%The integration of knowledge was symbolized in the arrangement of the academic buildings.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Unlike many college campuses which feature an impressive structure at the center of the campus, such as a chapel or administrative hall, Calvin has no such building.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The major buildings on campus are all in a great circle around the Commons Lawn.
established$$$@@@%%%The lawn was intended and serves as the common point of interaction between faculty, students, and administration.
type$$$@@@%%%Following the ideal of an integrated community, all of the buildings are intended serve a variety of purposes.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Administration is mixed with classrooms, faculty offices and lecture halls.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The departments are not sequestered apart from other departments by residing in separate buildings, but many departments share facilities to encourage the solidarity of purpose and unity contributing to a strong inter-departmental character and stronger Christian community.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In addition, the Prairie style of the buildings&#x2014;low-slung, set into the contours of the land, and all constructed of the same beige brick that has come to be known in Grand Rapids as &quot;Calvin Brick&quot;&#x2014;was intended to reflect Calvin's belief that we are caretakers of God's natural creation.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Academic Buildings</h4>
students$$$@@@%%%<p> Calvin has nine academic buildings on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The first to be constructed was Hiemenga Hall, named after John Hiemenga and built in 1961.

nickname$$$@@@%%%<h3>Festival of Faith and Music</h3>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Festival of Faith and Music is a biennial event exploring the intersection of Christian faith and popular music.
established$$$@@@%%%It is in some ways a child of the Festival of Faith and Writing that has been taking place at the same institution since the early 90s, and the two events alternate years, but it is organized independently of that event by the Student Activities Office.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Starting out with two small events in 2003 and 2005 (each with 150-200 attendees), the festival grew dramatically and tickets for the 2007 event (over 1000) sold out in advance, due in part to the heightened profile of its headline acts and in part growing word of mouth.</p>
