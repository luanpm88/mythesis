<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Hiram Hadley</a> In 1888, an institution of higher learning, based in small adobe buildings, known as Las Cruces College&#x2014;led by Hiram Hadley, a respected educator from Indiana&#x2014;had even bigger plans in mind, which was established in the heart of the small village of the same name.
One year later, a foundation for much growth was established when the Territorial Assembly of New Mexico provided for the establishment of an Agricultural College and Agricultural Experiment Station with bill No. 28 or the Rodey Act of 1889.
The bill stated that, &quot; Said institution is hereby located at or near the town of Las Cruces in the County of Do&#x00f1;a Ana,upon a tract of land of not less than one hundred (100) acres, contiguous to the main Las Cruces irrigating ditch, south of said town.&quot;
The institution, which was designated as the land-grant college for New Mexico under the Morrill Act, was named the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts..</p>
<p>Las Cruces College merged with New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, and the new school opened on January 21, 1890.
That first semester there were 35 students in the college level and preparatory classes and six faculty members.
Classes met in the old two-room building of Las Cruces College until suitable buildings could be put on the 220-acre campus three miles south of Las Cruces.
In February 1891, the university's first building McFie Hall, popularly known as Old Main, opened its doors.
Unfortunately, the building burned down in 1910, but its remains can be seen in the center of Pride Field on the University Horseshoe, or old university center</p>
<p>In a move to better represent its operations, the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts was changed by the state constitutional amendment to New Mexico State University in 1960.</p>
<p>Today New Mexico State University sits on a 900-acre campus and enrolls 18,497 students from all 50 states and from 71 nations.
<p>New Mexico State University is the land grant university of the state of New Mexico.
As a thriving center of  higher education, deeply rooted in the southwestern tradition, its role as a comprehensive university is  recognized throughout the state.
New Mexico State University offers a wide variety of programs through the  Graduate School and the colleges:  Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Arts and Sciences,  Business, Education, Engineering, Extended Learning and Health and Social Services.
At its four branch community colleges,  <a>Alamogordo</a>, <a>Carlsbad</a>, <a>Do&#x00f1;a Ana</a> and <a>Grants, New Mexico</a> State University offers academic,  vocational/technical, and continuing education programs.
Through a statewide network of 9 research facilities, the Agricultural Experiment Station conducts  basic and applied research supporting agriculture, natural resources management, environmental quality, and  improved quality of life.

<p>Since its founding as New Mexico&#x2019;s land-grant college in 1888, New Mexico State University has encouraged and supported creative scholarly activity of its faculty and students.
New Mexico State University is ranked 105th among colleges and universities in research and development in the nation, and is ranked 29th among institutions nationally without medical school in terms of R&amp;D expenditures by <a>National Science Foundation</a>.
Most early research followed mandates of the founding legislation of land-grant colleges by generating knowledge useful in agriculture and engineering.
Over time, however, research has expanded from this focus on applied natural sciences to include all disciplines of the university.
Today, creative scholarly activity leads to basic scientific discoveries as well as practical applications emanating from the natural and social sciences, arts, humanities, business, education and health sciences in addition to engineering and agriculture.

<p><a>thumb|New Mexico State University Goddard Hall</a> In the 1940s, the Victory Bell, a gift of the Class of 1939, was housed in an open-sided structure on the Horseshoe and rung to announce Aggie victories.
In 1972, the bell was rededicated as the NMSU Engineer's Bell and mounted on a platform near Goddard Hall.
On game days, various school organizations took turns in toting the ringing bell around Las Cruces prior to kick-off.
The Bell was then taken to Aggie Memorial Stadium where it salutes Aggie touchdowns with its distinctive &#x2013; and loud &#x2013; chimes.
<p>&quot;A&quot; Tradition In 1920, students of then New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts scouted for an appropriate place to display their school letter.
Brave males gathered enough stones to form a big &quot;A&quot; easily visible from campus and the surrounding area.
On the following day, April 1, students trudged up the mountain side with their five-gallon cans of whitewash and splashed it on the stones, turning them into a gleaming white &quot;A&quot;.
For many years, giving the &quot;A&quot; its annual fresh coat of whitewash was an all school effort.
The seniors mixed lime and water at the foot of the mountain and the freshmen and sophomores toted the mixture up to the juniors who splashed it on the &quot;A.&quot;
With the growth of the university through the years, the tradition was taken over by the Greek Council..</p>
