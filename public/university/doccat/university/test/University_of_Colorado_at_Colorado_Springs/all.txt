established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> As early as the 1920s, CU offered classes in the Colorado Springs area at various locations, mostly Colorado College.
established$$$@@@%%%By the 1960s, however, a permanent campus was desired.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Colorado Governor</a> <a>John Arthur Love</a> and <a>Hewlett-Packard Company</a> co-founder <a>David Packard</a> (whose company had a huge presence in the city) led a drive to establish a permanent home for the university.
established$$$@@@%%%The solution came when George T. Dwire sold the Cragmor Sanatorium property for $1 to the state.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1965 UCCS moved to its current location on Austin Bluffs Parkway in the Cragmor neighborhood of northern Colorado Springs.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus is located at one of the highest parts of the city.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Because of its ties to HP, initial university programs focused on engineering and business, and classes were held in the Cragmor Sanotorium building, what is now Main Hall, and Cragmor Hall, a modern expansion of Main Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%The first building built exclusively for UCCS, Dwire Hall, was not complete until 1972.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A 1997 community referendum merged Beth-El College of Nursing with UCCS.
established$$$@@@%%%In recent years, programs such as the Network Information and Space Security Center were added to connect the university with the military to improve <a>national security</a>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Other programs, including the CU Institute for Bioenergetics and the Institute for Science and Space Studies, cast an eye toward the future.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2001 UCCS purchased an  building at the corner of Union and Austin Bluffs to house the Beth-El College of Nursing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While on his campaign trail, Presidential Nominee <a>Barack Obama</a> made a stop on the campus.
established$$$@@@%%%His agenda was helping senators with current Colorado budget issues and answering questions of Colorado voters.</p>
