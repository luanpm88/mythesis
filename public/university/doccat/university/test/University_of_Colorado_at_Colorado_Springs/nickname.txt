<h3>Athletic facilities</h3>
Attempts at separating seating sections did not significantly help in alleviating overcrowding where students are often turned away at popular events.
There also exists major problems with the lack of locker room space for use by the athletic teams during competitions.
The events center to be completed by January 2010 will seat about 1,200 to 1,400 sporting event fans and have the ability to hold more conferences, camps, and convocation events.
The varsity soccer and softball teams practice and compete at these facilities as well as club and intramural sports.</p>
<p>The varsity cross country, track and field, and golf teams find practice and competition spaces mostly off-campus often at nearby colleges, high schools, or other facilities and locations if required.</p>
