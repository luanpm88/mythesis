<p>   The <strong>University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</strong> (<strong>UCCS</strong>; formerly <strong>CU-Springs</strong>) is a campus of the <a>University of Colorado System</a>, the <a>state university system</a> of <a>Colorado</a>.</p>
<em>U.S. News</em> ranked UCCS as the 32nd in master's universities in the <a>West</a> for the 2009 rankings.
It has been ranked in the top ten on that list each year since 2002.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> As early as the 1920s, CU offered classes in the Colorado Springs area at various locations, mostly Colorado College.
By the 1960s, however, a permanent campus was desired.</p>
<p><a>Colorado Governor</a> <a>John Arthur Love</a> and <a>Hewlett-Packard Company</a> co-founder <a>David Packard</a> (whose company had a huge presence in the city) led a drive to establish a permanent home for the university.
The solution came when George T. Dwire sold the Cragmor Sanatorium property for $1 to the state.
<p>In 1965 UCCS moved to its current location on Austin Bluffs Parkway in the Cragmor neighborhood of northern Colorado Springs.
The campus is located at one of the highest parts of the city.</p>
<p>Because of its ties to HP, initial university programs focused on engineering and business, and classes were held in the Cragmor Sanotorium building, what is now Main Hall, and Cragmor Hall, a modern expansion of Main Hall.
The first building built exclusively for UCCS, Dwire Hall, was not complete until 1972.</p>
<p>A 1997 community referendum merged Beth-El College of Nursing with UCCS.
In recent years, programs such as the Network Information and Space Security Center were added to connect the university with the military to improve <a>national security</a>.
<p>In 2001 UCCS purchased an  building at the corner of Union and Austin Bluffs to house the Beth-El College of Nursing.</p>
<p>While on his campaign trail, Presidential Nominee <a>Barack Obama</a> made a stop on the campus.
His agenda was helping senators with current Colorado budget issues and answering questions of Colorado voters.</p>

<p>The CSS mission is to promote the educational development of the space workforce through graduate programs offered through the UCCS College of Engineering and Applied Science.</p>
<li>Master of Engineering in Space Operations</li>
Collaboration involves a workshop for regional high-school students titled the Near Earth Object project (NEO project).</p>
<li>Dwire Hall (1972) &ndash; Renovated from 2006 to 2007, it serves as the building for classes in business, economics, languages and cultures, and film studies.</li>
Renovated at the beginning of the millennium to expand the library and add the University Center.</li>
Divided into Vail, Steamboat, Telluride, Aspen, Keystone, Monarch, and Brekenridge (laundry, computer facilities, and seminar rooms).
<li>Campus Recreation Center (2007) &ndash; Recently completed, this new state-of-the-art recreation building for students, replacing the current facilities at the University Center, features a swimming pool, a climbing wall, and a full basketball court, along with the full complement of equipment.</li>
<li>Centennial Hall (2010) &ndash; The building was completely gutted and rebuilt inside with the exception of new classrooms added in 2006.
Formerly called the Science Building, it was built in 1981 and used for science and anthropology classes along with the student art gallery.</li>
The center is projected to open in early 2010.</li>
The smaller facility would house general classrooms and be a new home for the Psychology department and a non-UCCS clinic that specializes in geriatric care.</li>
<p>In 2000, the CU Board of Regents designated UCCS as the CU growth campus.
In 2003, the <a>Colorado Legislature</a> approved revisions in the university's statutory role and mission to remove geographic and program restrictions.
In 2005, the Regents approved a seven-year plan that calls for the university to add to its base of 7,650 students (Fall 2004), 347 FTE faculty and 254 FTE staff.</p>
<p>In addition to the completion of the recreation center, Dwire Hall renovation, and the third wing of the new science/engineering building, the seven-year plan also calls for the renovation and transition of the old <a>Heller Center</a> on the other side of the bluff that campus sits in front of into a sort of &quot;arts retreat.&quot;
Also, by 2014, two new buildings are in the works for Summit, and by that year the Alpine Village should be built out with three additional buildings across from the current ones.</p>
With the recent success of men&#x2019;s basketball, achieving the best record in UCCS history, amongst other things, led to an acceleration of plans to replace the facility with mounting pressure from students and athletes alike.
A temporary fix that was completed in early 2007 cost $40,000 and only slightly expanded and upgraded seating.
<p>After projected costs for the field house more than doubled, the university decided that a permanent events center would be a better use of funds amid plans for a major sports arena to be built in less than 10 years.
<p>An agreement between the university and the <a>Colorado Springs Christian School</a> nearby lead to the construction of a professional quality soccer and football field at the recently built 4-diamonds sports complex that also consists of three softball fields which are sometimes contracted for use by high school and little league teams.
<p>A brand new Student Recreation Center was completed in August and September 2007 which houses the Recreation Department overseeing club and intramural sports.
The Recreation Center consists of a pool and hot tub, gymnasium, indoor jogging track, bouldering wall, aerobics room, and a cardiovascular and weight lifting floor as well as a small smoothie shop.
This was the first LEED-certified building in the campus' history and the first LEED-Gold public building in Southern Colorado.
It is believed to be the second recreation center in the U.S. to receive LEED-Gold designation.</p>
<p>The university is home to <em><a>Writers' Forum</a></em>, a national literary journal founded in 1974.</p>
