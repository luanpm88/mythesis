<p> <strong>Ushaw College</strong> (<strong>St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw</strong>) is a <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>seminary</a>, due to close in 2011.
It was founded at <a>Douai</a> as the <a>English College, Douai</a> in <a>France</a> in 1568, which moved to <a>Ushaw Moor</a>, four miles west of <a>Durham</a> in <a>England</a> in 1808 and became a <a>Licensed Hall</a> of the <a>University of Durham</a> in 1968.
It is independent of the University but offers courses validated by the University.
Both Church and lay students study at the college.
In 2002 the College rejected a report from the Roman Catholic hierarchy that it should merge with <a>St Mary's College, Oscott</a>, near Birmingham.
In October 2010 it was announced that the college is to close in the summer of 2011 due to the shortage of vocations in the Roman Catholic Church, and that the site is likely to be sold.</p>
The Refectory was designed and built by <a>Pugin</a>, as was the original chapel although this was later dismantled and replaced by the present building designed by <a>Dunn and Hansom</a>.
The original college buildings (1804&#x2013;1808) were designed by James Taylor.</p>
<p>Various emblems on shield represent the college's history and foundation, for example:-</p>
<li>The small cross of St Cuthbert represents the College's patron saint (it is modelled on St. Cuthbert's own pectoral cross, which is kept in the Treasury at Durham Cathedral).</li>
<li>The large cross of St George honours the English Roman Catholic Martyrs.</li>
