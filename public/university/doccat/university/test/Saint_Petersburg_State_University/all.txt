established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university is widely considered to be one of Russia's oldest universities.
established$$$@@@%%%There is an ongoing debate as to whether it is, in fact, Russia's oldest university, as this title is also claimed by the Lomonosov State University of Moscow (Moscow State University).
established$$$@@@%%%The reason for this uncertainty can be ascribed to the two sperate occasions on which the university was founded and then refounded; the first occasion, 1724, predates the foundation of Moscow State University in 1755.
nickname$$$@@@%%%However, the second occasion, in 1819, does not.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Thus the case is open to interpretation and there is yet no definitive answer.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Hallway in the Twelve Collegia building, St. Petersburg State University: one of the longest academic hallways in the world&lt;/center&gt;</a> It is disputed by the university administration whether Saint Petersburg State University or <a>Moscow State University</a> is the <a>oldest higher education institution</a> in Russia.
established$$$@@@%%%While the latter was established in 1755, the former, which has been in continuous operation since 1819, itself claims to be the successor of the university established on January 24, 1724 by a decree of <a>Peter the Great</a>, together with the Academic Gymnasium and <a>Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Immanuel Kant State University of Russia</a> in <a>Kaliningrad</a> claims to be the successor of the <a>Albertina</a> founded in East Prussia in 1544, though there is hardly any degree of continuity at all.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the period between 1803 and 1819, Saint Petersburg University officially did not exist; the institution founded by Peter the Great, the Saint Petersburg Academy, had already been disbanded, because the new 1803 charter of the Academy of Sciences stipulated that there should be no educational institutions affiliated with it.
established$$$@@@%%%The Petersburg Pedagogical Institute, renamed the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1814, was established in 1804 and occupied a part of the <a>Twelve Collegia</a> building.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On February 8, 1819 (O.S.), <a>Alexander I of Russia</a> reorganized the Main Pedagogical Institute into Saint Petersburg University, which at that time consisted of three faculties: Faculty of Philosophy and Law, Faculty of History and Philology and Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, and enrolled several dozen students.
established$$$@@@%%%Since there is some degree of continuity between the Academy, the Pedagogical Institute, and the University, Saint Petersburg State University may be considered the oldest university in Russia.
former_names$$$@@@%%%In 1821 the university was renamed Saint Petersburg Imperial University.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1823 most of the university moved from the Twelve Collegia to the southern part of the city beyond the <a>Fontanka</a>.

staff$$$@@@%%%In 1829 there were 19 full professors and 169 full-time and part-time students in the university.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1830 <a>Tsar Nicholas</a> passed the entire building of the Twelve Collegia back to the university, and the courses returned there.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1835 a new Charter of the Imperial Universities of Russia was approved.
established$$$@@@%%%According to it during the following years the Faculty of Law was established and the Faculty of History and Philology and Faculty of Physics and Mathematics were merged into the Faculty of Philosophy as the 1st and 2nd Departments, respectively.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1849 after the <a>Spring of Nations</a> the Senate of the Russian Empire decreed that the Rector should be appointed by the <a>Minister of National Enlightenment</a> rather than elected by the Assembly of the university.

established$$$@@@%%%On March 1, 1887 (O.S.) <a>a group of the university students</a> was arrested while planning an attempt on the life of <a>Alexander III of Russia</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, new admission rules to gymnasiums and universities were approved by the Minister of National Enlightenment <a>Ivan Delyanov</a> in 1887, which barred persons of ignoble origin from admission to the university, unless they were extraordinarily talented.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%In 1902 the first student <a>dining hall</a> in Russia was opened in the university.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since about 1897 regular strikes and unrests of students had shaken the university and spread to other higher education institutions across Russia.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1905 during the <a>Revolution</a> the charter of the Russian universities was amended once more, the autonomy of the universities was partially restored and the right to elect the rector was returned to the academic board for the first time since 1884.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1905&#x2013;1906 the university was temporarily closed due to the student unrest.
established$$$@@@%%%The autonomy was revoked again in 1911.
established$$$@@@%%%In the same year the university was temporarily closed again.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1914 with the start of the <a>First World War</a>, the university was renamed Petrograd Imperial University after its namesake city.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1915 a branch of the university was opened in <a>Perm</a>, which later became <a>Perm State University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Assembly of Petrograd Imperial University openly welcomed the <a>February Revolution</a> of 1917, which put an end to the Russian monarchy, and the university came to be known as just Petrograd University.
established$$$@@@%%%However, after the <a>October Revolution</a> of 1917, the staff and administration of the university were initially vocally opposed to the <a>Bolshevik</a> takeover of power and reluctant to cooperate with the <a>Narkompros</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Later in 1917&#x2013;1922 during the <a>Russian Civil War</a> some of the staff suspected of counter-revolutionary sympathies suffered imprisonment (e.g.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1918 the university was renamed 1st Petrograd State University, and in 1919 the Narkompros merged it with the 2nd PSU (former Psychoneurological Institute) and 3rd PSU (former <a>Bestuzhev Higher Courses for Women</a>) into Petrograd State University.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1919 the Faculty of Social Science was established by the Narkompros instead of the Faculty of History and Philology, Faculty of Oriental Languages and Faculty of Law.

established$$$@@@%%%<a>Rabfak</a>s and free university courses were opened on the basis of the university to provide mass education.
established$$$@@@%%%In the fall of 1920, as observed by freshman student <a>Alice Rosenbaum</a>, enrollment was open and the majority of the students were anti-communist including, until removed, a few vocal opponents of the regime.
established$$$@@@%%%Seeing that they were educating &quot;class enemies&quot;, a purge was conducted in 1922 based on the class background of the students and all students, other than seniors, with a bourgeois background were expelled.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 1920s the university, like other higher education institutions in the Soviet Union, became subject to educational experimentation.
established$$$@@@%%%The structure and status of the faculties and departments of the university underwent major changes.
established$$$@@@%%%Many of them were merged, split or renamed, new subdivisions were established, independent institutes were merged into the university as faculties, sometimes only to be restored to their old status a few years later.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1924 the university was renamed Leningrad State University after its namesake city.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1925 the Faculty of Geography was opened.
established$$$@@@%%%In order to suppress intellectual opposition to Soviet power, a number of historians working in the university, including <a>Sergey Platonov</a>, <a>Yevgeny Tarle</a> and <a>Boris Grekov</a>, were imprisoned in the so-called Academic Affair of 1929&#x2013;1930 on fabricated charges of participating in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1948 the <a>Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union</a> named the university after <a>Andrei Zhdanov</a>, a recently deceased prominent communist official.
established$$$@@@%%%This decision was revoked in 1989 during <a>Perestroika</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the late 1940s the university was hit hard by ideological and <a>anti-Semitic</a> purges.
