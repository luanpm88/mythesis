<h2>History</h2>
<p>In many respects IUPUI was established long before its 1969 merger.
The historically most prestigious portions of IUPUI are the professional graduate schools and the art school: <a>Indiana University School of Medicine</a>, <a>Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis</a>, <a>Indiana University School of Liberal Arts</a>, the Indiana University School of Dentistry, and the Indiana University Herron School of Art, all of which were established decades prior to the 1969 merger into one institution.
The School of Medicine and School of Dentistry are the only degree-granting <a>public university</a> programs of medicine and dentistry in Indiana and have been since becoming part of Indiana University.</p>
<p>The vision for an IUPUI first was inspired by the formation of the Indiana Purdue Foundation in <a>Fort Wayne</a> in 1958 for the creation of what has become <a>IPFW</a>.
<p>The School of Medicine's large campus west of downtown Indianapolis was chosen to be the site of what was to become IUPUI.
Prior to forming IUPUI, other Indiana University and Purdue University schools were located at various locations within and near downtown Indianapolis.
With the formation of IUPUI and the relocation of those academic units to the IUPUI campus adjoining the School of Medicine's Medical Center, some of those academic units for the first time were housed in buildings designed at time of construction for academic use, instead of business-office buildings as had been the case previously for the undergraduate extension centers.</p>
The Jaguars have earned NCAA Tournament bids in <a>Men's Soccer</a>, Men's Golf, <a>Men's Basketball</a> and Women's Tennis, as well as a Mid-Continent Conference (now The Summit League) championship in <a>Volleyball</a> and <a>Men's Tennis</a>.
The men's cross country team has been recognized by the <a>United State Cross Country Coaches Association</a> as Academic All-American the past two seasons, while the women&#x2019;s team earned the same honor from the <a>Women's Intercollegiate Cross Country Coaches Association</a> twice.
In 2001-02, the women's basketball team was selected by the <a>Women's Basketball Coaches Association</a> to its Top 25 Honor Roll.
In the fall of 2002, the athletic department as a whole was honored by <a>USA Today</a> and the <a>NCAA</a> for having the highest improvement in graduation rate in the country for its category.
<p>The campus is home to the <a>Indiana University Natatorium</a>, host of numerous national swimming championships, and the <a>Michael A. Carroll Stadium</a>, home of the 2006 &amp; 2007 USA Track &amp; Field Championships.
The Indianapolis Tennis Center is also on the IUPUI campus and has served, since 1979, as the home of the Indianapolis Tennis Championships (formerly the RCA Championships).</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Cavanaugh Hall</a> The IUPUI campus covers  and is located just west of downtown near the <a>Indianapolis Zoo</a>, Downtown Canal Walk, and <a>White River State Park</a>.
It is adjacent to the Indiana Avenue cultural district.
In 2004 &amp; 2005, new residence halls, the Informatics, Communication &amp; Information Technology Building (ICTC), and Eskenazi Hall, the new home of the <a>Herron School of Art &amp; Design</a> were completed on campus.
<p>A new Campus Center was opened in Spring 2008.
Its completion in 2008 will create a  research complex with direct connections to Research II and the IU Cancer Research Institute, as well as a skyway connection to the <a>Clarian Health People Mover</a>.</p>
<p>Campus housing has the capacity for 1,060 students in a traditional residence hall (Ball Residence) and the Campus Apartments on the River Walk, which opened in 2004.
Another residence hall is going to be built in order to accommodate 1,000 more students.</p>
<p>Ralph D. Gray's book <em>IUPUI&#x2014;the Making of an Urban University</em> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003) is a comprehensive published account of the history of the campus.</p>
<p>The <a>IUPUI University Library</a> has developed comprehensive programs in the areas of Information Literacy and Digital Libraries.
It is also home to the Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives and the leading collection for the study of Philanthropy in the world, the Joseph and Matthew Payton Philanthropic Studies Library.
The Herron Art Library at the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI is a full-service branch of the University Library.</p>
The <a>list of public art at IUPUI</a> currently consists of 31 artworks.</p>
<li><a>Norman Bridwell</a> (Herron 1950) - author and illustrator of <a>Clifford the Big Red Dog</a></li>
<li><a>George Hill</a> - Professional <a>NBA</a> <a>basketball</a> player, drafted 26th overall in <a>2008 NBA Draft</a> by the <a>San Antonio Spurs</a></li>
<li><a>Trischa Zorn</a> (Law 2005) - Paralympian swimmer</li>
<p>The university offers $50,000 each year to students, faculty, and staff to fund green initiatives.
The new campus center has many &quot;green&quot; features, and the school's Renewable Energy Center was named for Senator Richard G. Lugar in 2007.
The college received a C- on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card, a publication of the Sustainable Endowments Institute.</p>
