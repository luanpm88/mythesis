established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In many respects IUPUI was established long before its 1969 merger.
established$$$@@@%%%The historically most prestigious portions of IUPUI are the professional graduate schools and the art school: <a>Indiana University School of Medicine</a>, <a>Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis</a>, <a>Indiana University School of Liberal Arts</a>, the Indiana University School of Dentistry, and the Indiana University Herron School of Art, all of which were established decades prior to the 1969 merger into one institution.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In particular, the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Indiana University School of Dentistry in Indianapolis are not merely regional branches of programs at some main campus in the <a>Indiana University System</a> or the <a>Purdue University System</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The School of Medicine and School of Dentistry are the only degree-granting <a>public university</a> programs of medicine and dentistry in Indiana and have been since becoming part of Indiana University.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The vision for an IUPUI first was inspired by the formation of the Indiana Purdue Foundation in <a>Fort Wayne</a> in 1958 for the creation of what has become <a>IPFW</a>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Fort Wayne's Indiana Purdue Foundation is unrelated to IUPUI, but the formation of such a joint venture between Indiana's two largest university systems inspired metropolitan and state government leaders in Indianapolis to consider the same type of merger for their disparate Indiana University professional graduate schools, Indiana University undergraduate extension center, and Purdue University undergraduate extension center.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The School of Medicine's large campus west of downtown Indianapolis was chosen to be the site of what was to become IUPUI.
established$$$@@@%%%Prior to forming IUPUI, other Indiana University and Purdue University schools were located at various locations within and near downtown Indianapolis.
established$$$@@@%%%With the formation of IUPUI and the relocation of those academic units to the IUPUI campus adjoining the School of Medicine's Medical Center, some of those academic units for the first time were housed in buildings designed at time of construction for academic use, instead of business-office buildings as had been the case previously for the undergraduate extension centers.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Athletics</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>IUPUI's teams&#x2014;the IUPUI Jaguars&#x2014;compete at the <a>Division I</a> level in <a>The Summit League</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Jaguars have earned NCAA Tournament bids in <a>Men's Soccer</a>, Men's Golf, <a>Men's Basketball</a> and Women's Tennis, as well as a Mid-Continent Conference (now The Summit League) championship in <a>Volleyball</a> and <a>Men's Tennis</a>.
head_label$$$@@@%%%Nine athletes have been recognized as Mid-Con Athletes of the Year, with seven coaches earning Coach of the Year honors.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Prior to 1995, the teams were known as the Metros and were <a>Division II</a>.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>IUPUI's athletic teams have also excelled in the classroom.
faculty$$$@@@%%%The women's tennis team has been chosen as an All-Academic Team by the <a>Intercollegiate Tennis Association</a> for three consecutive years; collectively, they have maintained an almost C-average for those three years.
established$$$@@@%%%The men's cross country team has been recognized by the <a>United State Cross Country Coaches Association</a> as Academic All-American the past two seasons, while the women&#x2019;s team earned the same honor from the <a>Women's Intercollegiate Cross Country Coaches Association</a> twice.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2001-02, the women's basketball team was selected by the <a>Women's Basketball Coaches Association</a> to its Top 25 Honor Roll.
established$$$@@@%%%In the fall of 2002, the athletic department as a whole was honored by <a>USA Today</a> and the <a>NCAA</a> for having the highest improvement in graduation rate in the country for its category.
country$$$@@@%%%In 2003, the athletic department as a whole was honored by <a>USA Today</a> once again for having the largest discrepancy in graduation rates from the athletics department and general student population.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The campus is home to the <a>Indiana University Natatorium</a>, host of numerous national swimming championships, and the <a>Michael A. Carroll Stadium</a>, home of the 2006 &amp; 2007 USA Track &amp; Field Championships.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Additionally, the 1987 Pan-American Games were hosted on the IUPUI campus, while IUPUI also served as the annual site for the Nike All-America Basketball Camp until 2007.
established$$$@@@%%%The Indianapolis Tennis Center is also on the IUPUI campus and has served, since 1979, as the home of the Indianapolis Tennis Championships (formerly the RCA Championships).</p>
