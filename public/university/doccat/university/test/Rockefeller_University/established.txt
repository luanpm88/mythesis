<p>  The <strong>Rockefeller University</strong> is a private <a>university</a> offering <a>postgraduate</a> and <a>postdoctoral</a> education.
The Rockefeller University is located on <a>Upper East Side</a> of <a>Manhattan</a> in <a>New York City</a>, between 63rd and 68th Streets along York Avenue.</p>
<p>Its president is <a>Sir Paul Nurse</a>, who plans to leave Rockefeller University by the end of 2010.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>What is now The Rockefeller University was founded in 1901 as The <strong>Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</strong> by oil baron and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>, who had earlier founded the <a>University of Chicago</a> in 1889.
Sometimes called simply The <strong>Rockefeller Institute</strong> (not to be confused with <a>The Rockefeller Foundation</a>, a philanthropic organization), its first director was <a>Simon Flexner</a>, former student of <a>William H. Welch</a>.
Its focus throughout much of the 1900s was the development of both <a>basic science</a> and <a>biomedical engineering</a>.
The institute changed its name to The Rockefeller University in 1965, after expanding its mission to include education.</p>
<p>Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from The Rockefeller Institute or The Rockefeller University.
Rockefeller scientists, for example, <a>established that DNA is the chemical element of heredity</a>, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can trigger cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, developed <a>methadone</a> maintenance for individuals addicted to heroin, devised the <a>AIDS &quot;cocktail&quot;</a> drug therapy, and identified the weight-regulating hormone <a>leptin</a>.</p>
The <a>Rockefeller family</a> has maintained strong links with the institution throughout its history; <a>David Rockefeller</a>, for instance, is the Honorary Chairman and a Life Trustee.</p>
