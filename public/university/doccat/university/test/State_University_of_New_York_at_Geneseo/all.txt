doctoral$$$@@@%%%<p>Geneseo's students celebrate many longstanding traditions and campus legends.</p>
motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Bronze Bear</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|The Bronze Bear Fountain is on Main Street.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%Just off campus, in the center of Main Street in Geneseo sits the famous Bronze Bear statue.
established$$$@@@%%%School legend has it that if a virgin ever graduates from Geneseo, the bear will come down off of the fountain and run away, never to be seen again.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;The Bear&quot; also plays host to any number of spontaneous decorations and pranks throughout the academic year.
established$$$@@@%%%A story also circulates that one of the wealthy Wadsworth daughters saw the bear fountain in a small town in Germany, fell in love with it, bought it, and sent it back to Geneseo in the early 19th century.
established$$$@@@%%%This story is unverified, but an excerpt from a history of the family that settled the valley implies that this is not true, and that the fountain was designed and built for its current location: &quot;[Main Street] is still dominated by a drinking fountain for horses dedicated to Mrs. Emmeline Austin Wadsworth.
established$$$@@@%%%For some obscure reason its designer placed a short pole in its center on top of which sits a cunning little iron bear, who is generally known as 'Aunt Emmeline'&quot;.</p>
motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Greek Tree</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the Sturges quad, students from different Greek organizations sneak about late at night to paint a &quot;Greek tree.&quot;
affiliations$$$@@@%%%[<a>http://www.geneseo.edu/~ago/photos/alumni/1980s/1980_ago_tree.jpg</a>].

established$$$@@@%%%The exact date when this practice began is unknown, but alumni report that it began sporadically during the 1950s and became regular practice in the mid to late 1960s.</p>
motto$$$@@@%%%<h3>The Seuss Spruce</h3>

established$$$@@@%%%Also in the Sturges quad is the famous &quot;Seuss Spruce,&quot; so called because it looks like a <a>Dr.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Seuss</a> illustration.
established$$$@@@%%%It is said that the tree's shape was due to being weighed down by ice and snow during a particularly tough winter, and now the tree simply grows in a crooked and slightly spiral shape.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Adding to the Seussian quality of the tree is the fact that the bottom branches &quot;fan out&quot; along the ground.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Sunsets</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sunsets on campus are also legendary, so much so that students and alumni say the sunset at Geneseo was once ranked by <em><a>National Geographic Magazine</a></em> as one of the top ten in the world.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This claim has been verified as false&#x2014;<em>National Geographic</em> publishes no such ranking&#x2014;but lives on in campus lore.
established$$$@@@%%%Just off the Sturges Quad there is a Gazebo providing panoramic views of the Genesee Valley and its sunsets.
