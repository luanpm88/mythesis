<h2>History</h2>
US Ambassador to Israel, [[Ogden Reid]], in the center]] Bar Ilan University has Jewish-American roots: it was conceived in Atlanta in a meeting of the American Mizrahi organization in 1950, and was founded by Prof. Pinkhos Churgin, an American rabbi and educator.
When it was opened in 1955, it was described by The New York Times &quot;as Cultural Link Between the [Israeli] Republic and America&quot;.
The university was named for <a>Rabbi</a> <a>Meir Bar-Ilan</a> (originally <em>Meir Berlin</em>), a <a>Religious Zionist</a> leader who served as the inspiration for its establishment.
Although he was trained in Orthodox seminaries in <a>Berlin</a>, he believed there was a need for an institution providing a dual curriculum of secular <a>academic</a> studies and religious <a>Torah</a> studies.
<p>The founders of the university hoped to produce <a>alumni</a> committed to Jewish tradition, Zionist ideology and science.
In 1965, the  professors and lecturers were all religious Jews, as were the majority of students.
<a>Yosef Burg</a>, one of the prominent leaders of the <a>religious Zionist movement</a> warned that admission of too many non-religious into the university could undermine its character: &quot;If you spill too much water into a wine bottle, you will have no wine.&quot;
<p>Bar-Ilan operates a <a>kollel</a> for men and a <a>midrasha</a> for women.
The kollel offers traditional <a>yeshiva</a> studies with an emphasis on <a>Talmud</a>, while the midrasha offers courses in <a>Torah</a> and <a>Jewish philosophy</a>.
<p><a>Yitzhak Rabin's</a> convicted assassin, <a>Yigal Amir</a>, was a student of law at Bar-Ilan, prompting charges that the university had become a hotbed of political <a>extremism</a>.
One of the steps taken by the university following the assassination was to encourage dialogue between <a>left</a> and <a>right-wing</a> students.</p>
<p>Under university president Moshe Kaveh, Bar-Ilan has undergone a major expansion, with new buildings added on the northern side of the <a>campus</a>.
The university has placed <a>archaeology</a> as one of its priorities, and this includes excavations such as the Tell es-Safi/Gath archaeological excavations  and the recently opened Bar-Ilan University/<a>Weizmann Institute of Science</a> joint program in Archaeological Sciences.</p>
<p>Bar Ilan's Law Department made headlines in 2008 by achieving the highest average Israeli Bar Exam grade of 81.9 by its graduates.</p>

<p>Bar-Ilan offers a preparatory program that readies <a>new immigrants</a> for <a>Israel</a>i colleges.
In addition, the university runs a One Year Overseas Program called Tochnit <a>Torah Im Derech Eretz</a>, which combines traditional <a>Kollel</a> <a>Torah</a> studies in the morning separate for men and women and co-ed general university studies and <a>Jewish history</a> classes in the afternoon.
Many <a>American</a> students enrolled in regular programs of study in the University also take these Jewish history classes to fulfill their <a>Jewish studies</a> requirements.</p>
<p>Bar-Ilan's on-line <a>responsa</a> project was awarded the <a>Israel Prize</a> in 2007.
The university's Bible project, in danger of being eliminated by continued budget cuts, was saved at the last minute by an anonymous donor.</p>
<p>Bar-Ilan University, in its capacity as a business school, was placed as the 4th best business school in Africa and the Middle East in the 2010 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a>.</p>
