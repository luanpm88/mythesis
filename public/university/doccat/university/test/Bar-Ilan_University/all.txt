established$$$@@@%%%US Ambassador to Israel, [[Ogden Reid]], in the center]] Bar Ilan University has Jewish-American roots: it was conceived in Atlanta in a meeting of the American Mizrahi organization in 1950, and was founded by Prof. Pinkhos Churgin, an American rabbi and educator.
established$$$@@@%%%When it was opened in 1955, it was described by The New York Times &quot;as Cultural Link Between the [Israeli] Republic and America&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was named for <a>Rabbi</a> <a>Meir Bar-Ilan</a> (originally <em>Meir Berlin</em>), a <a>Religious Zionist</a> leader who served as the inspiration for its establishment.
established$$$@@@%%%Although he was trained in Orthodox seminaries in <a>Berlin</a>, he believed there was a need for an institution providing a dual curriculum of secular <a>academic</a> studies and religious <a>Torah</a> studies.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The founders of the university hoped to produce <a>alumni</a> committed to Jewish tradition, Zionist ideology and science.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1965, the  professors and lecturers were all religious Jews, as were the majority of students.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Yosef Burg</a>, one of the prominent leaders of the <a>religious Zionist movement</a> warned that admission of too many non-religious into the university could undermine its character: &quot;If you spill too much water into a wine bottle, you will have no wine.&quot;
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Today, the student population includes secular and non-Jewish students, including <a>Arab</a>s.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In the past, all Jewish male students were required to cover their heads, but this is no longer the case.

established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Yitzhak Rabin's</a> convicted assassin, <a>Yigal Amir</a>, was a student of law at Bar-Ilan, prompting charges that the university had become a hotbed of political <a>extremism</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Under university president Moshe Kaveh, Bar-Ilan has undergone a major expansion, with new buildings added on the northern side of the <a>campus</a>.
