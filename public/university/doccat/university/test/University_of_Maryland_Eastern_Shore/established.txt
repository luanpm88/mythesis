Later UMES came to be called <strong>Industrial Branch of Morgan State College and Princess Anne Academy</strong>.
The State of Maryland, in operating its Land-Grant program at the Maryland Agricultural College at College Park, which did not admit African American students, sought to provide a Land-Grant program for African Americans.
In 1919 the state of <a>Maryland</a> assumed control of the academy and changed its name to <strong>Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College</strong>.
Finally, in 1970, the name became University of Maryland of Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>From its original campus building known as &quot;Olney,&quot; which was constructed in 1798 during the era of President George Washington, the University has grown to over 745 acres with 32 major buildings and 41 other units.The student population has increased to 4,500.
With the strong support of the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, Administration, and the faculty, UMES has developed an academic program perhaps more impressive than any other higher education institution of its size in the East.
