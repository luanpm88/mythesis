established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1672 Hoar went again to Massachusetts to preach, by invitation, at the <a>Old South Church</a>, Boston.
established$$$@@@%%%He brought a letter, dated 5 February 1672, addressed to the magistrates and ministers in Massachusetts Bay by thirteen nonconformist ministers in and around London, friends of the colony and  agents in raising funds for a new college building, who strongly recommended Hoar for the post of president of Harvard as successor to <a>Charles Chauncy</a>, who died 19 February 1672.
established$$$@@@%%%The general court voted an increase of salary on the condition that Hoar was elected.
established$$$@@@%%%He was accordingly chosen, to the disappointment of <a>Urian Oakes</a>, who was widely regarded as Chauncy's legitimate successor.
established$$$@@@%%%Hoar was immediately elected and installed as President of Harvard on December 10, 1672; a position he held until he resigned on March 15, 1675.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>:&quot;At all events the students fell away from the president, and 'set themselves to <em>Travestie</em> whatever he <em>did</em> and <em>said</em>, and aggravate everything in his behavior disagreeable to them, with a design to make him Odious'.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Cotton Mather</a> in his <em><a>Magnalia Christi Americana</a></em> stated that :&quot;He was forced to resign ... 'his grief threw him into a <a>Consumption</a> whereof he died November 28, 1675 in Boston'.
