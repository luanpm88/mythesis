established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|King Saud University entrance</a> The idea of establishing the first university in the <a>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a> came as a natural response to the educational revival the kingdom enjoyed since its foundation.
established$$$@@@%%%With the reign of <a>King Abdulaziz Al Saud</a>, the kingdom&#x2019;s government sought to propagate education throughout the country.
established$$$@@@%%%His efforts were crowned when <a>King Fahd</a> assumed the office of the first <a>Ministry</a> of Education.
established$$$@@@%%%Right after the first session of the Council of Ministers, he gave the following statement: &#x201c;We will shortly establish the Saudi University; this is a foregone conclusion.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%This university will be one of the most prominent houses of culture and sciences, and will be worthy of our country where the light of Islamic faith and civilization has emanated.&#x201d;</p>
