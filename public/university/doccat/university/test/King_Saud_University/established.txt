It was founded in 1957 by <a>King Saud bin Abdul Aziz</a> as <strong>Riyadh University</strong>, as the first university in the kingdom not dedicated to religious subjects.
The university was created to meet the shortage of skilled workers in <a>Saudi Arabia</a>.
It was renamed to King Saud University in 1982.</p>
The university offers courses in the natural sciences, the humanities, and professional studies, for which it charges no tuition.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|King Saud University entrance</a> The idea of establishing the first university in the <a>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a> came as a natural response to the educational revival the kingdom enjoyed since its foundation.
With the reign of <a>King Abdulaziz Al Saud</a>, the kingdom&#x2019;s government sought to propagate education throughout the country.
His efforts were crowned when <a>King Fahd</a> assumed the office of the first <a>Ministry</a> of Education.
Right after the first session of the Council of Ministers, he gave the following statement: &#x201c;We will shortly establish the Saudi University; this is a foregone conclusion.
<p>As has already been stated, King Saud University (KSU) was established in accordance with the dictates of Royal Decree no. 17 of 21/4/1377H (1957).
The actual study started in the College of <a>Arts</a> in the academic year 1377/78.
Since that time, KSU went through many stages of developments, and its administrative organization received meticulous attention.
Over a period of twelve years, the <a>university</a> enjoyed the endorsement of three Royal Decrees which grounded its Statute.</p>
112 of 26/12/1380H recognized that: King Saud University is an independent legal character, with a budget of its own, responsible for higher education, promoting scholarly research, and advancement of sciences and arts in the country.
Naming the Minister of Education as the <a>President</a> of the university, the Statute ordered that the University have a Vice President and Secretary General, and that each <a>college</a> and institute have a <a>Dean</a>, Vice Dean, and a <a>council</a>.</p>
<p>Royal Decree no M/11 of 8/5/1387H enforced the Statute of the University of the University of Riyadh (currently King Saud University), rescinding all earlier statutes, bylaws, and regulations.
Of the main landmarks of the new Statute is the creation of the Higher Council of the University as one of its administrative powers.
<p>The Higher Council of the University is the dominant power over the university affairs: it draws out policies, issues decisions to implement and achieve the objectives of the university (especially those pertaining to the creation of new colleges and departments), proposes budgets, and systems of faculty salaries, annuities, and financial awards.</p>
The Higher Council of the University issues the bylaws governing the number of the Academic Council&#x2019;s members, responsibilities, and powers.</p>
<p>These decrees were issued in response to the growing and widening needs of the university as the establishment of new colleges started.
Between 1378-1380H, three colleges were established: the College of Sciences, College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy.
In 1381/1382H women were first admitted into the College of Arts and the College of Public Administration.</p>
<p>Five years later (1385/1386H) the College of Agriculture was established.
In the same year the College of Engineering and College of Education, having been under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the UNESCO, were annexed to the University.
A year later (1389/1390H) the College of Medicine opened.
In 1394/1395H the Arabic Language Institute was inaugurated to serve non-Arabic speakers.
Again, a year later (1396H) the College of Dentistry and the College of Applied Medical Sciences were added to the Riyadh campus, while launching at the same time the Abha based campus with the College of Education.
In 1398H the Graduate College assumed its office in supervising and organizing all graduate programs in the various departments of the University.</p>
<p>At Abha, the College of Medicine was established according to Royal Order no.
3/M/380 of 29/2/1400H and was added to the University according Royal Directive no.
Formal study there started in the academic year of 1401/1402H.</p>
<p>In 1401H another branch of the University opened at Qassim with three colleges: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, and Economics and Administration.
Formal study started in 1401/1402H academic year.
<p>In 1402H, celebrating its 25th anniversary, the University of Riyadh went back to its original name of King Saud University at the orders of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz.
<p>Two years later (1404H) two other colleges were created: the College of Computer and Information Science Sciences and the College of Architecture and Planning.
Later, in 1411H, the Institute of Languages and Translation was established to be turned four years later into the full-fledged College of Languages and Translation.</p>
<p>In 1414 the Royal ratification of the System of the Council of Higher Education and Universities was issued dictating that each university form its own Council which attends to its academic, administrative, and financial affairs, and carries out its general policy.</p>
33 dictated the creation of a King Saud University Community College in Jazan, as well as the establishment of the College of Sciences at the Qassim campus.</p>
7/78/M of 11/3/1419 decreed that <a>King Khalid University</a> be created in the south.
The branches of <a>Imam University</a> and of King Saud University consequently formed the new university.
In the same year, after the issuance of the unified regulations for Graduate Studies at Saudi universities, the Graduate College became the Deanship of Graduate Studies, and the Deanship of Academic Research was established in accordance with the dictates of the System of Academic Research issued that year.</p>
<p>In 1421H the College of Medicine was established at the Qassim campus, and the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education was turned into the College of Applied Studies and Community Service.</p>
<p>In 1422H, the Community College in Riyadh was inaugurated according to the Cabinet Council no.
During the academic year of 1423/1424 the College of Science at Al-Jouf was established.
That same year the College of Engineering was opened at the Qassim campus, and the creation of community colleges at Al-Majma&#x2019;ah, Al-Aflaj, and Al-Qurayat was approved.</p>
On 26/11/1424H the Council of Higher Education approved the promotion of the Department of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences, into the College of Nursing.</p>
<p>The following were the Presidents of University since its inception:</p>
