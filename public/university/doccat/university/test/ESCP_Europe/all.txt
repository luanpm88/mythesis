free_label$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|ESCP Europe in Paris, avenue de la R&#x00e9;publique.
established$$$@@@%%%The dedicated building was completed in 1859</a> <strong>ESCP Europe</strong> is the result of a merger in 2000 of two institutions: the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> and the <em>EAP</em> (<em>Ecole Europ&#x00e9;enne des Affaires</em>).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> was founded in 1819 by a circle of economists and traders including the famous economist <a>Jean-Baptiste Say</a> and the banker Vital Roux.
established$$$@@@%%%As such, it is the oldest establishment dedicated to <a>business</a> and <a>finance</a> teaching in the world.
established$$$@@@%%%It was modeled on the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was much more modest in its beginnings, mainly because it had not been supported by the state.
established$$$@@@%%%It gradually gained in stature and importance during the 19th century and moved to its current location, <em>avenue de la R&#x00e9;publique</em>, in Paris, in 1859.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The 20th century gave importance to business studies, and soon enough the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> saw its importance rise.
established$$$@@@%%%Its popularity meant it had to develop a rigorous selection process.
established$$$@@@%%%By the mid-20th century, the school was considered an elite institution and admitted its students after two years of dedicated <a>preparatory classes</a> through a competitive entrance exam.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <em>EAP</em> (<em>European School of Management</em>) was created in 1973 as a result of a European initiative to create a trans-national elite business school.
nickname$$$@@@%%%From its inception, the school had campuses in four major European cities: Paris, Oxford, D&#x00fc;sseldorf, and Madrid.
established$$$@@@%%%The D&#x00fc;sseldorf campus moved to Berlin in 1984.
established$$$@@@%%%Students were recruited after two years preparatory classes in France and after a Bachelor's degree in the UK through a competitive entrance exam.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2000, the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> merged with the <em>EAP-Ecole Europ&#x00e9;enne des Affaires</em> to form the <strong>ESCP-EAP</strong> European School of Management.
established$$$@@@%%%This merger was the starting point for the new long-term strategy of the school to train managers able to adapt to any culture and work in any country and to gain international visibility.
established$$$@@@%%%It adopted the slogan &quot;Learn everywhere, Manage anywhere&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2004 it added a campus in Turin and in 2005 it moved its Oxford campus to London.</p>
