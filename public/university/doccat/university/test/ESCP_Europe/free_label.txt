The 20th century gave importance to business studies, and soon enough the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> saw its importance rise.
<p>In 2000, the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> merged with the <em>EAP-Ecole Europ&#x00e9;enne des Affaires</em> to form the <strong>ESCP-EAP</strong> European School of Management.
<p>Students also work on two compulsory consultancy projects, working alongside a company to deal with a real and concrete need.</p>
<p>ESCP-Europe's 30,000 alumni form a strong network, following the long-lasting tradition of the <a>Grandes &#x00c9;coles</a> &quot;esprit de corps&quot;.
9,000 alumni work outside of France.</p>
