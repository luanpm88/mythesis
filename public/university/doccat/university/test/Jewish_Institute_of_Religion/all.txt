established$$$@@@%%%<p>Wise's early support for Zionism, and his dispute with Reform hierarchy over the &quot;question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good&quot;, led to the establish of his <a>Free Synagogue</a> in 1907.
established$$$@@@%%%Wise remained president until 1948, and housed JIR next to his Free Synagogue on West 68th Street, he hoped that its graduates would generate other Free Synagogues &quot;animated by the same spirit of free inquiry, of warm Jewish feeling, and of devotion to the cause of social regeneration.&quot;

established$$$@@@%%%Negotiations were completed in 1948 and in 1950 the two schools merged.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1954 a school in Los Angeles was chartered and, in 1963, primarily as a result of Glueck's efforts, a Jerusalem campus, initially devoted to archaeology, was opened.&lt;ref
