It is affiliated with the <a>Church of God</a>, which has its headquarters in the same town.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lee University (previously named Church of God Bible Training School, and later Lee College) has seen its strongest growth since the 1980s, during which time enrollment has quadrupled and full university status attained.
Lee's student body consists of 4,377 (grown from 960 in 1986) students (as of Fall 2010).
<p>Up to the 1970s the university culture had suspicion on people who held Ph.D.s, and the university had an open enrollment policy that placed functionally illiterate students and academically ambitious students in the same classes.
Hanna Rosin, author of <em>God's Harvard</em>, described the university culture at the time as having &quot;some vestiges of the Pentecostal anti-intellectualism&quot;.</p>
<p>Lee University is well-known for its academic program and the extensiveness and diversity of its extracurricular activities.
<p>Entering freshmen of Lee University choose their courses of study, developed under the guidance of a faculty adviser.
The Gateway course is taught by a professor who is paired with an upper class student.
Included in the total is a <a>minor</a> in <a>Theology</a> that consists of 18 credit hours and is required of all students, regardless of their program of study.</p>
Although Lee is notable for its <a>religious education</a>; <a>pre-medicine</a>, <a>business</a>, <a>elementary education</a>, and <a>music</a> are also considered among its strongest specialties.
Lee's intensive teaching, active learning, residence in a community of cultural and global diversity, and the institution's commitment to <a>Christian philosophy</a> in both social and academic life come together to form a distinctive experience of liberal education.</p>
<p>Lee features more than 60 student organizations in which to participate, which include:</p>
<li>Society for Law and Justice</li>
