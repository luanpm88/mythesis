Unlike chapters of most &quot;Greek&quot; <a>fraternities and sororities</a>, the primary Greek organizations on Lee University's campus are neither national nor recognized as fraternities or sororities and are instead colloquially referred to as &quot;Greek clubs.&quot;
The only national Greek fraternities at Lee University are <a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> and <a>Sigma Alpha Iota</a>, but they are officially regarded as academic organizations because of the administration's current policy against admitting national Greek fraternities and sororities onto its campus.</p>
