<p><strong>Bocconi University</strong> (italian full name: <strong>Universit&#x00e0; Commerciale Luigi Bocconi</strong>) is a private university of <a>Milan</a>, <a>Italy</a>, dedicated to <a>economic</a> and <a>law</a> studies.
The university was founded in 1902 by Ferdinando Bocconi.</p>
Its MBA program has recently been ranked among the global top 40 by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em><img> Global MBA Rankings 2009.. Since 2008, Bocconi has also expanded its research division by inaugurating dedicated research centers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The athenaeum was founded in 1902 by Ferdinando Bocconi who intended to create in his hometown, Milan, an institution where accountants and future businessmen could improve their cultural and technical skills.
The university was named after the founder's son who died in the <a>battle of Adwa</a>, during the <a>first Italo-Ethiopian War</a>.
Since this tragic event Ferdinando Bocconi decided to sell his business and endow the revenues in the new school of commerce to keep his son's memory alive.</p>
<p>The university was a first affiliated to the engineering school <a>Politecnico di Milano</a> and the teaching model developed at first was inspired by the one adopted at the &#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure of <a>Antwerp</a>.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Bocconi has stood for <a>liberalism</a>, <a>pluralism</a>, and <a>social progress</a>.
In the words of its first Rector and President, <a>Leopoldo Sabbatini</a>, a <a>democratic</a> <a>lawyer</a>, Bocconi's aim is to <em>&quot;promote harmony between school and life.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Today, Bocconi is a university of international standing in <a>business</a>, <a>economics</a>, and <a>law</a>.
Bocconi presently offers Bachelor Degrees, Masters of Science, MBAs and PhDs in <a>Finance</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Management</a>, <a>Statistics</a>, <a>Law</a> and other disciplines.
<p>Furthermore, the university promotes and often organizes numerous activities for <a>high school</a> students in Italy, such as <a>mathematics competition</a>s , <a>Model United Nations</a> simulations and other major events aimed at orienting them during their <a>secondary education</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, Bocconi was located in Via Statuto, near the <a>Pinacoteca di Brera</a>, where its first building was inaugurated in 1902.
The current campus of Bocconi is located between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of different buildings, all at walking distance to <a>Porta Ticinese</a>, the <a>Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio</a> and the <a>Torre Velasca</a> <a>skyscraper</a>.</p>
<p>The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the famous <a>architect</a> <a>Giuseppe Pagano</a> and is an epitome of <a>modernism</a> in Italian architecture.
<p>The <em>pensionato</em> building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by the architect Giovanni Muzio and  hosts some grand halls, some of the <a>canteen</a> and <a>dormitory</a> facilities (350 bedrooms distributed on 5 floors), and some <a>faculty</a> offices.
The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a <a>symmetric</a> &quot;<a>L</a>&quot; letter.
The <a>SDA Bocconi</a> building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels.
The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university's bookstore.
The campus <a>football pitch</a> is placed between the <em>pensionato</em> and the <a>SDA Bocconi</a> building.</p>
<p>The modern <em>Velodromo</em> building was projected by <a>Ignazio Gardella</a> and launched in 2001.
It is called so due to its form resembling an ellipsoid <a>velodrome</a>.
Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150.
The <em>Velodromo</em> uses a <a>geothermal exchange heat pump</a> as its <a>air conditioning</a> system, which contributes a lot to <a>energy conservation</a>.
A <a>marble</a> statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.</p>
<p>Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the <a>Library</a> building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus <a>chapel</a> <em>&quot;San Ferdinando&quot;</em>, and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the <em>&quot;Language Center&quot;</em> and other <a>extracurricular</a> activities.</p>
<p>In 2007, a new building was constructed near the <em>Velodromo</em>.
It was designed by Grafton architects of Dublin, who won the competition held to choose the design of the building in 2002.

<p>The University offers four three-year undergraduate courses in <a>Economics</a> which share a common basis in the first three semesters and then distinguish themselves from one another by focusing on either <a>Finance</a>, <a>Social sciences</a> or <a>Business administration</a>; the fourth course is taught in <a>English language</a> and is targeted at both international students and students pursuing an international career.
<p>A fifth separate three-year undergraduate course in Economics focuses on the economics and management of <a>Arts</a>, <a>Culture</a> and <a>Communication</a>.</p>
<p>The University furthermore offers a five-year course in <a>Law</a>, which incorporates the Italian equivalents of the <a>Bachelor of Laws</a>  and the <a>Master of Laws</a>.</p>
<p>In a joint venture with the <a>Central European University</a> of <a>Budapest</a>, Bocconi also offers a four-year <em>Dual Degree in International Business</em>, the first two years of which are spent in <a>Budapest</a> and the latter in <a>Milan</a>.

<p>Bocconi has concluded a number of partnership with regards to its Master of Science: the Master of Sciences in Finance was among the first six programs in the world to conclude a partnership with the CFA institute and the first in continental Europe, while the Master of Sciences in Management and International Management enable a selected number of students to take part in the <a>CEMS</a> Master of International Management, which Bocconi is a founding member of along HEC, Esade and Universit&#x00e4;t zu K&#x00f6;ln.
