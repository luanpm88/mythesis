website$$$@@@%%%<h4>Original Fort Wayne campus</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>What is now Taylor University whose main campus is in <a>Upland, Indiana</a>, began during 1846 as Fort Wayne Female College in <a>Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%With the urban setting of <a>Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>, this campus' academic programs tended to be more vocational and its student body more <a>non-traditional</a>.
free$$$@@@%%%Reflecting this, of TUFW's 1,040 member student body, approximately 224 students lived on campus with the rest commuting or taking courses online.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On October 13, 2008, the university announced plans to discontinue traditional undergraduate programs on the Fort Wayne Campus.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Popular majors included Professional Writing, Biblical Studies, Christian Ministries, Education, English, and Business.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>TUFW athletics program was called the Falcons and participated in the <a>United States Collegiate Athletic Association</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The school offered basketball for men and women, soccer for men and women (2008-2009 was the first year for the women's program), and women's volleyball.</p>
website$$$@@@%%%<h4>Upland campus</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|300px|Swallow Robin Hall</a> A guest-preaching engagement in 1882 in the Upland Methodist Church afforded Taylor University (then Fort Wayne College) president Thaddeus Reade the chance to meet the minister of Upland Methodist Church, Rev. John C. White.
established$$$@@@%%%Because the school was having financial difficulties at its location in Fort Wayne, White and Upland citizen J.W. Pittinger worked to bring the school to Upland.
established$$$@@@%%%In the spring of 1893 White negotiated an agreement between the Taylor trustees and the Upland Land Company, whereby the university agreed to move to <a>Upland, Indiana</a>, and the company agreed to provide Taylor with $10,000 in cash and  of land.
established$$$@@@%%%In the summer of 1893, Taylor University relocated to Upland.
established$$$@@@%%%White was able to find the resources to support Taylor University because of the recent discovery of large deposits of natural gas in the area.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1915, Taylor paid seven thousand dollars to purchase  more from Charles H. and Bertha Snyder.
established$$$@@@%%%Swallow Robin Hall, the oldest remaining residence hall on campus, was built in 1916 by <a>Samuel Plato</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The university added another  to its present location in the early 1920s when the Lewis Jones farm was purchased.
established$$$@@@%%%It originally served as a cafeteria, but now serves as the student union.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Upon the celebration in 1993 of Taylor's 100th anniversary in Upland, the university worked with the community to purchase and relocate a train depot from Muncie to Upland to serve as a local museum.
established$$$@@@%%%Since then, the university has expanded its offerings to include a Master of Environmental Science, a <a>Master of Business Administration</a>, a <a>Master of Arts in Higher Education and Student Development (MAHE)</a>, and a Master of Arts in Religious Studies.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The concept of &quot;The Integration of Faith and Learning,&quot; the idea that knowledge and faith meet their highest potential when coupled together, is a central educational theme at Taylor.
established$$$@@@%%%The two distinct columns of the Rice Bell Tower on campus and the spotlights that shine up from each of them symbolize this theme to the campus community.
established$$$@@@%%%Community members pledge to adhere to certain standards of conduct and refrain from certain behaviors, including social dancing (excepting marriages taking place off of school property and choreographed or folk dance), premarital sex, homosexuality, smoking, and the consumption of alcohol, with the intention of strengthening the community as a whole.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Students cannot register for classes or housing unless they have signed the LTC pledge each year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The LTC is viewed as not only a covenant, but as a binding contract as well.
established$$$@@@%%%Penalties for not adhering to the LTC range from &quot;citizenship probation&quot; to expulsion from the university.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, those found to be in violation of the LTC usually must also sign in to chapel services held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Life Together Covenant covers activities and behaviors not only on the Taylor campus, but off-campus as well.
established$$$@@@%%%The purpose is to strengthen the Christian community and to maintain a sense of maturity and accountability.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Chapel services are held three times a week, from 10:00 to 10:50 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Services generally follow a modern nontraditional Christian theme.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Chapel attendance is expected but attendance is on the honor system.
type$$$@@@%%%In spite of this, chapel is nearly always well attended.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Silent Night</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Every year the Friday before final exams, Taylor University has the Silent Night Men's Basketball game.
established$$$@@@%%%In it, students remain quiet until the 10th point is scored and then erupt in cheering.
established$$$@@@%%%A former assistant coach came up with the idea in the late 80's and it was a packed event by the mid-to-late 1990's.
established$$$@@@%%%Afterward, students can go to &quot;Habecker's Hollapalooza&quot;, which is a campus-wide party involving live Christmas music, making and eating Christmas cookies, and making gingerbread houses.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The combination of the two events is called &quot;Christmas Fandango&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%This was the most scored by the Taylor men's basketball team since the 1993-94 squad scored 139 points in a victory over <a>Robert Morris University (Illinois)</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Coach Paul Patterson coached without shoes for the 2009 and 2010 games to raise money for Samaritan's Feet (400 pairs of shoes were raised at the 2009 event for the Dominican Republic and 170 pairs of shoes were raised for Guatemala at the 2010 event).

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>2006 van accident</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On April 26, 2006, Taylor received national attention when a University van was involved in a fatal accident outside <a>Marion, Indiana</a>, while traveling between the Fort Wayne and Upland campuses.
established$$$@@@%%%The accident happened when a northbound <a>semi-trailer truck</a> driver fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the median and struck the southbound passenger van on <a>I-69</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%Four students and one staff member were killed, and three staff members and one student were injured.
affiliation$$$@@@%%%The accident occurred two days before current University president Eugene Habecker's <a>inauguration</a> ceremony.
established$$$@@@%%%The truck driver was convicted of reckless, involuntary <a>manslaughter</a> and received a four-year <a>prison sentence</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>However, because the <a>Grant County</a> <a>coroner</a> and Taylor officials failed to positively identify all the victims, the incident later made international headlines when there was a shocking case of <a>mistaken identity</a> between two of the victims.
established$$$@@@%%%Senior Laura Van Ryn, who died on the scene, was mistaken for surviving freshman <a>Whitney Cerak</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This was initially thought to be due to Cerak being in a <a>coma</a> for several weeks, a minor resemblance between the two women, swelling to Cerak's face, and Cerak's family being reluctant to personally identify the body.
established$$$@@@%%%The Cerak (actually Van Ryn) funeral was conducted with a closed casket, and the mistake was not discovered until Cerak identified herself after waking up from a coma over a month later.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Neither family spoke publicly about the incident for nearly two years.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the fall of 2007, the popular <a>Fox</a> television series <em><a>House</a></em>, aired the first episode of the show's fourth season entitled &quot;Alone,&quot; which was inspired by the Van Ryn-Cerak case of mistaken identity.
established$$$@@@%%%A Third Season episode of <em><a>CSI: NY</a></em>, titled &quot;<a>And Here's To You, Mrs. Azrael</a>&quot;, which aired November 15, 2006, was also similar to the &quot;Case Of Mistaken Identity Story&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The families' silence was broken when their story was chronicled in a recent book, <em>Mistaken Identity: Two Families, One Survivor, Unwavering Hope</em>, written by Whitney Cerak, her parents Newell and Colleen, Don and Susie Van Ryn and Mark Tabb, which was released on March 25, 2008.
established$$$@@@%%%On March 27 and 28, 2008, the Ceraks and Van Ryns were interviewed on <a>NBC</a>'s <em><a>The Today Show</a></em> and were also profiled on a two-hour episode of <em><a>Dateline</a></em> on the 28th.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|300px|The prayer chapel built in memory of those killed in the van accident</a> During the <em>Dateline</em> interview, the Van Ryns revealed that they had suspected that the patient in the hospital was not their daughter for several days prior to informing officials.
established$$$@@@%%%Soon after the accident, the Van Ryns noticed several key indicators that Whitney was not Laura, such as discovering the difference in Cerak's teeth and <a>navel</a> piercing (which Van Ryn did not have), and Cerak later stating that her name was Whitney, not Laura, after coming out of her coma.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The Van Ryns revealed that family friends eventually had expressed concerns that the woman they were caring for was not their daughter.
students$$$@@@%%%Don Van Ryn also revealed that Cerak had accused them of being &quot;false parents.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Finally, when Cerak told Laura's sister the name of her parents, Newell and Colleen, the Van Ryns notified officials of the tragic mistake - more than a month after the accident.
president$$$@@@%%%The Van Ryns explained their actions by stating that they were convinced by medical personnel that Cerak was their daughter and that emotional distress kept them from realizing the truth.
type$$$@@@%%%It is believed that this admission, along with possible resulting public criticism, is one of the reasons the families had not publicly spoken about the incident for two years.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>As a result of this incident, Indiana changed the procedure for identifying victims involved in accidents.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Cerak graduated from Taylor on May 23, 2009, and the two families remain close.
established$$$@@@%%%On April 26, 2008, the two year anniversary of the accident, the University dedicated the $2.4 million Memorial Prayer Chapel as a memorial to the victims: students Laurel Erb, Brad Larson, Betsy Smith and Laura Van Ryn, along with Taylor employee Monica Felver.</p>
