image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early Years, 1869&#x2013;1930</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Photo of an early building on the Straight University campus</a> The history of Dillard University dates back to 1869 and its founding predecessor institutions--<a>Straight University</a> and <a>Union Normal School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Responding to the post-<a>Civil War</a> need to educate newly freed African Americans in New Orleans, Louisiana and the surrounding region, the <a>American Missionary Association</a> of the Congregational Church founded Straight University on June 12, and Union Normal School was established by the <a>Freedman's Aid Society</a> of the Methodist Episcopal Church on July 8.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition to Straight University, the AMA helped found several other <a>Historically Black Colleges and Universities</a>, such as Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University (with Freedmen's Bureau), Huston-Tillotson University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Talladega College, and Tougaloo College.
established$$$@@@%%%Straight University and Union Normal School later became Straight College and <a>New Orleans University</a>, respectively.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Both schools offered elementary level education, but quickly enlarged curriculum to include secondary, collegiate, and professional level instruction.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>New Orleans University operated a secondary school--<a>Gilbert Academy</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%By the 1890s, the university offered professional medical training.
established$$$@@@%%%It included a school of pharmacy, the <a>Flint Medical College</a>, and the <a>Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%After the medical college was ended in 1911, the <a>Flint Goodridge Hospital</a> emerged and continued nurse training.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|200px|Straight University graduating class of 1901</a> Straight College also offered professional training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886, and its graduates participated in local and national <a>Reconstruction</a> and post-Reconstruction era <a>civil rights</a> struggles.
established$$$@@@%%%For example, 1876 Straight University Law School graduate, <a>Louis Andr&#x00e9; Martinet</a>, published <em>The Crusader</em>--a civil rights daily, co-founded the <a>Comit&#x00e9; des Citoyens</a> (Citizens' Committee), and played a significant role in the <a>Plessy v. Ferguson</a> landmark Supreme Court case.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Other notable alumni includes, <a>P.B.S. Pinchback</a> (first African American governor of a U.S. state), <a>Alice Dunbar Nelson</a> (Harlem Renaissance foremother), and Dr. <a>James W. Ames</a> (founded <a>Dunbar Hospital</a>, the first <a>Detroit</a> hospital to admit blacks).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>&quot;A Great Negro University in New Orleans&quot;: 1930&#x2013;1935</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the late 1920s, local Black and White leaders felt there was a need for a larger, more notable African American institution of higher learning to emerge within New Orleans and the greater South.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to economic hardships and rounds of negotiations between the two institutions, Straight College and New Orleans University chartered Dillard University on June 6, 1930.
established$$$@@@%%%Named after <a>James H. Dillard</a>, the new university was created to &quot;... offer a traditional liberal arts curriculum&#x2014;rather than nonprofessional, vocational training&quot; and emphasize a close engagement with the Black community through &quot;various education extension programs, societies, and clubs.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Despite the hope of this new charter, the building of Dillard University was tempered by its context of Jim Crow America.
free$$$@@@%%%Many local Whites took concern with the possibility of a Black president presiding over White faculty members.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Similarly, the increased numbers of African American bus riders in the Gentilly area disturbed some White sensibilities.
established$$$@@@%%%As an influential and diplomatic member of Dillard's board of trustees, <a>Edgar B. Stern</a> suggested <a>Will W. Alexander</a> as a suitable compromise.
established$$$@@@%%%Will W. Alexander, a white Southern preacher, was Dillard's first acting president (1935&#x2013;1936), whose experience as the director of the <a>Commission on Interracial Cooperation</a> proved valuable.
established$$$@@@%%%Dillard University opened its doors in the fall of 1935, and was able to attract a number of prominent scholars, such as <a>Horace Mann Bond</a>, psychology and education; <a>Frederick Douglass Hall</a>, music; <a>Lawrence D. Reddick</a>, history; and <a>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Clair Drake</a>, sociology and anthropology.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In August 2005, the campus, not far from the lower <a>levee</a> breach of the <a>London Avenue Canal</a>, suffered extensive flood damage in the aftermath of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Nelson Hall was destroyed by a fire.
established$$$@@@%%%A bus fire also destroyed belongings of 37 students who were in the process of being evacuated.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In spring 2006, the students of Dillard University took their normal classes at The New Orleans World Trade Center and The New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel.
established$$$@@@%%%As is tradition, Dillard held graduation on the Rosa Freeman Keller Avenue of the Oaks in July 2006.
city$$$@@@%%%They returned to campus in September 2006.</p>
