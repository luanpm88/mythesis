<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Photo of an early building on the Straight University campus</a> The history of Dillard University dates back to 1869 and its founding predecessor institutions--<a>Straight University</a> and <a>Union Normal School</a>.
Responding to the post-<a>Civil War</a> need to educate newly freed African Americans in New Orleans, Louisiana and the surrounding region, the <a>American Missionary Association</a> of the Congregational Church founded Straight University on June 12, and Union Normal School was established by the <a>Freedman's Aid Society</a> of the Methodist Episcopal Church on July 8.
In addition to Straight University, the AMA helped found several other <a>Historically Black Colleges and Universities</a>, such as Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University (with Freedmen's Bureau), Huston-Tillotson University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Talladega College, and Tougaloo College.
Straight University and Union Normal School later became Straight College and <a>New Orleans University</a>, respectively.
<p>New Orleans University operated a secondary school--<a>Gilbert Academy</a>.
It included a school of pharmacy, the <a>Flint Medical College</a>, and the <a>Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School</a>.
After the medical college was ended in 1911, the <a>Flint Goodridge Hospital</a> emerged and continued nurse training.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|Straight University graduating class of 1901</a> Straight College also offered professional training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886, and its graduates participated in local and national <a>Reconstruction</a> and post-Reconstruction era <a>civil rights</a> struggles.
For example, 1876 Straight University Law School graduate, <a>Louis Andr&#x00e9; Martinet</a>, published <em>The Crusader</em>--a civil rights daily, co-founded the <a>Comit&#x00e9; des Citoyens</a> (Citizens' Committee), and played a significant role in the <a>Plessy v. Ferguson</a> landmark Supreme Court case.
<h3>&quot;A Great Negro University in New Orleans&quot;: 1930&#x2013;1935</h3>
<p>By the late 1920s, local Black and White leaders felt there was a need for a larger, more notable African American institution of higher learning to emerge within New Orleans and the greater South.
Due to economic hardships and rounds of negotiations between the two institutions, Straight College and New Orleans University chartered Dillard University on June 6, 1930.
Named after <a>James H. Dillard</a>, the new university was created to &quot;... offer a traditional liberal arts curriculum&#x2014;rather than nonprofessional, vocational training&quot; and emphasize a close engagement with the Black community through &quot;various education extension programs, societies, and clubs.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the hope of this new charter, the building of Dillard University was tempered by its context of Jim Crow America.
As an influential and diplomatic member of Dillard's board of trustees, <a>Edgar B. Stern</a> suggested <a>Will W. Alexander</a> as a suitable compromise.
Will W. Alexander, a white Southern preacher, was Dillard's first acting president (1935&#x2013;1936), whose experience as the director of the <a>Commission on Interracial Cooperation</a> proved valuable.
Dillard University opened its doors in the fall of 1935, and was able to attract a number of prominent scholars, such as <a>Horace Mann Bond</a>, psychology and education; <a>Frederick Douglass Hall</a>, music; <a>Lawrence D. Reddick</a>, history; and <a>St.
<p>In August 2005, the campus, not far from the lower <a>levee</a> breach of the <a>London Avenue Canal</a>, suffered extensive flood damage in the aftermath of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>.
A bus fire also destroyed belongings of 37 students who were in the process of being evacuated.
<p>In spring 2006, the students of Dillard University took their normal classes at The New Orleans World Trade Center and The New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel.
As is tradition, Dillard held graduation on the Rosa Freeman Keller Avenue of the Oaks in July 2006.
<p>In 2003, <a>Ray Charles</a> added a provision in his will to endow a $1 million professorship of African-American  culinary history at Dillard.
It is the first such position in the country.</p>
<p>Dillard University offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees in over 35 majors.
