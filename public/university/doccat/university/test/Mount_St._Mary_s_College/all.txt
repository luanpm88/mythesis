established$$$@@@%%%The college grew to two campuses in 1962 when it was given 20 acres (80,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;), holding two city blocks of <a>Queen Anne-style</a> <a>Victorian</a> mansions, in <a>Los Angeles</a> next to the <a>University of Southern California</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The tranquil property was formerly owned by <a>Edward L. Doheny</a> and his wife, the Countess Estelle Doheny, who made their fortune in oil.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Chester Place</a> residences were built at the turn of the century by Judge Charles Silent.
