The college was founded in 1925 by the <a>Sisters of St.
Three quarters of the student body is made up of <a>visible minority</a> students, while women make up nearly 95% of first-year undergraduate students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left|Mary Chapel, built in 1939, at the college's Brentwood campus.</a>
The college first held its classes at St. Mary's Academy, then located at West <a>Slauson Avenue</a> and Crenshaw Boulevard.
In 1928, the Sisters purchased 36 acres (150,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) of land along the foothills of the <a>Santa Monica Mountains</a> from the Rodeo Land and Water Company for $162,000.
The campus contains a blend of architecture familiar to Los Angeles, largely in the tradition of the <a>Spanish Colonial Revival</a> and <a>Mission Revival</a> styles.
The unique location of the <a>Brentwood</a> campus, on a 1,100-foot (340 m) ridge, provides an overlook to both the <a>Getty Center</a> and 40 miles (60&nbsp;km) of the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>.</p>
<p>Being the college's first campus, Chalon has been home to a number of important events in the history of the college.
In 1929, the College's first graduation was held on the Chalon campus.
In 1952, the college granted its first baccalaureate degrees in nursing, also the first in <a>Southern California</a>.
<p>Today, Chalon is home to the college's traditional <a>baccalaureate</a> programs.</p>

The college grew to two campuses in 1962 when it was given 20 acres (80,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;), holding two city blocks of <a>Queen Anne-style</a> <a>Victorian</a> mansions, in <a>Los Angeles</a> next to the <a>University of Southern California</a>.
The tranquil property was formerly owned by <a>Edward L. Doheny</a> and his wife, the Countess Estelle Doheny, who made their fortune in oil.
The <a>Chester Place</a> residences were built at the turn of the century by Judge Charles Silent.
The college named the campus after the Countess Doheny and her husband.
Due to the Countess' desire for privacy, the Dohenys purchased all the adjacent houses and made it into a private street.
The <a>University Park</a> campus is located in one of the oldest neighborhoods of the city.</p>
<p>The Doheny campus first played host to the college's Associate in Arts program when it opened in 1962.
Forty years later, in 2002, the college began its first doctoral degree, in physical therapy, which joined the other graduate programs now offered at the Doheny campus.</p>
<p>In 1992, the college launched its Weekend College program at the Chalon campus, which primarily focuses on providing working professionals the opportunity to complete their undergraduate degrees within four years by attending classes scheduled on weekends.
The Weekend College program moved to the Doheny campus in 2006, joining a number of courses for the associate and graduate programs offered at Doheny on weekday evenings and on weekends, furthering the idea of accessibility introduced by Weekend College.</p>
The college's seal, a circular shield, was designed by Baker's Heraldic office in London.
It has four divisions, each representing the college's founding.
At the highest point of the shield, a lily surrounded by thorns represents the Immaculate Conception by Mary.
The fleur-de-lis of France on the right symbolizes the Sisters of St.
Joseph of Carondelet, established at Le Put, France, in 1650.
On the left, three angel wings with the rose signify the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Particular care is necessary in distinguishing the college's name from that of other institutions with some variant of <em>Mount St. Mary</em> in their name.
<p>Due to its isolated location and beautiful vistas and architecture, a number of movies and television shows have filmed on either the Doheny or Chalon campus of the college.
