established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The seminary was founded in 1836, and is one of the most prestigious divinity schools in the country.
established$$$@@@%%%During the late-19th Century, Union Theological Seminary (UTS) became one of the leading centers of <a>liberal Christianity</a> in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1939 the <a>Auburn Theological Seminary</a> moved to its campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Among its graduates were the historian of Christianity <a>Arthur McGiffert</a>, biblical scholar <a>James Moffett</a>, <a>Harry Emerson Fosdick</a>, pastor of <a>Riverside Church</a>, who served as professor during his tenure there, and the Socialist leader <a>Norman Thomas</a>.
country$$$@@@%%%It is home to the <strong>Burke Theological Library</strong>, which is the largest theological library in the Western Hemisphere and serves a national and international field of scholars, pastors, and students.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%It contains more than 700,000 volumes, periodicals, manuscripts, scores, and rare historic materials.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|Union Theological Seminary entrance on Broadway</a> In 1895, members of the Union Theological Seminary Alumni Club founded <a>Union Settlement Association</a>, one of one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City.
established$$$@@@%%%After visiting Toynbee Hall in London, and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the East River and Central Park.
established$$$@@@%%%Known as East Harlem, it was a neighborhood filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services.
established$$$@@@%%%The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to &#x201c;settle&#x201d; in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents.
established$$$@@@%%%&#x201c;It seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,&#x201d; wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892&#x2013;1930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915&#x2013;1919).
city$$$@@@%%%Union Settlement still exists, providing community-based services and programs to support the immigrant and low-income residents of East Harlem.
country$$$@@@%%%One of East Harlem&#x2019;s largest social service agencies, Union Settlement reaches more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem, through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development and neighborhood cultural events.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On July 1, 2008, feminist theologian <a>Serene Jones</a> became Union's first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding <a>Joseph C. Hough, Jr.</a></p>

established$$$@@@%%%Its faculty has always ranked among the best in the world and has included such luminaries as <a>Walter Rauschenbusch</a>, <a>Reinhold Niebuhr</a>, <a>Paul Tillich</a>, <a>Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a>, <a>James Cone</a>, and others.
established$$$@@@%%%Its students come from around the country and the world.

established$$$@@@%%%Prominent public intellectual Dr. <a>Cornel West</a> commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977.
free_label$$$@@@%%%As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s (while neo-orthodoxy dissipated) and thus declined in prestige, UTS ran into financial difficulties, and shrank significantly because of a reduced student base.
established$$$@@@%%%Eventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia.
established$$$@@@%%%These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.</p>
