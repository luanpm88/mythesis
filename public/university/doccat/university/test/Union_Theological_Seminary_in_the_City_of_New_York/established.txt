<h2>History</h2>
<p>The seminary was founded in 1836, and is one of the most prestigious divinity schools in the country.
During the late-19th Century, Union Theological Seminary (UTS) became one of the leading centers of <a>liberal Christianity</a> in the United States.
In 1939 the <a>Auburn Theological Seminary</a> moved to its campus.</p>
<p>Among its graduates were the historian of Christianity <a>Arthur McGiffert</a>, biblical scholar <a>James Moffett</a>, <a>Harry Emerson Fosdick</a>, pastor of <a>Riverside Church</a>, who served as professor during his tenure there, and the Socialist leader <a>Norman Thomas</a>.
<p><a>thumb|left|Union Theological Seminary entrance on Broadway</a> In 1895, members of the Union Theological Seminary Alumni Club founded <a>Union Settlement Association</a>, one of one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City.
After visiting Toynbee Hall in London, and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the East River and Central Park.
Known as East Harlem, it was a neighborhood filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services.
The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to &#x201c;settle&#x201d; in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents.
&#x201c;It seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,&#x201d; wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892&#x2013;1930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915&#x2013;1919).
<p>On July 1, 2008, feminist theologian <a>Serene Jones</a> became Union's first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding <a>Joseph C. Hough, Jr.</a></p>
Its faculty has always ranked among the best in the world and has included such luminaries as <a>Walter Rauschenbusch</a>, <a>Reinhold Niebuhr</a>, <a>Paul Tillich</a>, <a>Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a>, <a>James Cone</a>, and others.
Its students come from around the country and the world.
The seminary is known for its progressive understanding of religion in general, and Christianity in particular, and has long been at the forefront of the great social movements in this nation's history.&quot;</p>
Serene Jones, the seminary's first female president, was inaugurated in November 2008.
Dr. <a>James Hal Cone</a> is one of the founders of <a>liberation theology</a> and is especially important in the development of African-American theology.
Dr. <a>James A. Forbes</a>, the former senior pastor of the adjacent <a>Riverside Church</a>, is an adjunct professor at the seminary and had been a full-time, chaired professor before accepting the Riverside post.</p>
<p><a>Reinhold Niebuhr</a> and <a>Paul Tillich</a> made UTS the center of both liberal and <a>neo-orthodox</a> Protestantism in the post-War period.
Prominent public intellectual Dr. <a>Cornel West</a> commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977.
Eventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia.
These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.</p>
<p>The school confers <a>Master of Arts</a>, <a>Master of Divinity</a>, <a>Master of Sacred Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a>, and offers joint degree programs with <a>Columbia University</a>.
