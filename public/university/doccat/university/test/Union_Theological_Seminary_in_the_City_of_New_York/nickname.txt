<li><a>Paul Tillich</a> (1886&ndash;1965) &mdash; German-American theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher.</li>
Of UTS he wrote: &quot;There is no theology here....they talk a blue streak without the slightest substantive foundation and with no evidence of any criteria.
They become intoxicated with liberal and humanistic phrases, laugh at the fundamentalists, and yet basically are not even up to their level.&quot;
