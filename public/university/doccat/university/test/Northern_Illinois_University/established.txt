<p><strong>Northern Illinois University</strong> is the second-largest <a>public university</a> in <a>Illinois</a>; only the <a>University of Illinois</a> is larger.
Located in <a>DeKalb</a>, <strong>NIU</strong> was founded on May 22, 1895 by Illinois Governor <a>John P. Altgeld</a> as a <a>satellite campus</a> for what is now <a>Illinois State University</a>.
The university also has satellite centers in <a>Hoffman Estates</a>, <a>Naperville</a>, <a>Rockford</a>, and <a>Oregon</a>.</p>
<p>NIU grew slowly over its first half-century, but since <a>receiving its current name</a> in 1957, the university has undergone tremendous expansion.
Today, the university is composed of seven degree-granting colleges, including a <a>College of Law</a>, and is placed by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> in the most prestigious category, &quot;National Universities&quot;, which are those schools conducting significant research and awarding degrees up to the doctoral level.
While within that category NIU is listed in the fourth-tier rankings (i.e., within the lowest 25 percent of schools in the National University category), many of its programs are rated as amongst the best in the country, including its College of Business and specifically, its <a>Accountancy</a> program, one of the top ten in the nation.</p>
<p>NIU is composed of seven degree-granting colleges that together offer over 60 <a>undergraduate</a> majors, 70 minors, nine pre-professional programs, and 79 <a>graduate</a> programs, including <a>a College of Law</a>, as well as eleven <a>doctoral</a> programs.
Besides being classified by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> as a &quot;National University&quot;, NIU is a member of the Universities Research Association, a group of 89 research universities from around the globe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|Davis Hall viewed from East Lagoon|</a> --&gt; <a>thumb|200px|left|Altgeld Hall, the first building to be constructed at NIU.</a> Northern Illinois University was founded through the creation of a Board of Trustees for the governance of the Northern Illinois State Normal School, as part of the expansion of the <a>normal school</a> program established in 1857 in <a>Normal, Illinois</a>.
In July, 1917, the Illinois Senate consolidated the boards of trustees for the five state normal schools into one state Normal School Board (<a>Eastern Illinois State Normal School</a>, Illinois State Normal School, Northern Illinois State Normal School, <a>Southern Illinois State Normal University</a>, and <a>Western Illinois State Normal School</a>)</p>
<p>Over the next fifty-eight years both the school and the governing board had their names change several times.
In 1931, the legislature gave the institution the name Northern Illinois State Teachers College and empowered it to award the four-year Bachelor of Education degree.
In 1941 the Normal School Board changed its name to the Teachers College Board.
In 1951 the Teachers College Board authorized the college to grant the degree Master of Science in Education, and the institution&#x2019;s Graduate School was established.
On July 1, 1955 , the state legislature renamed the college Northern Illinois State College and authorized the college to broaden its educational services by offering academic work in areas other than teacher education.
The Teachers College Board granted permission for the college to add curricula leading to the degrees Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science.
On July 1, 1957 the Seventieth <a>General Assembly</a> renamed Northern Illinois State College as Northern Illinois University in recognition of its expanded status as a <a>liberal arts</a> university.</p>
<p>In 1965, the Illinois State Teachers College Board became the Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities and was reorganized to include Northeastern University, Governor's State, and Chicago State Universities.
In 1967 authority for Northern Illinois University, Illinois State University, and Sangamon State University were passed on to the Board of Regents which governed the three Regency universities until that board was disbanded at the end of 1995.
On January 1, 1996 authority for Northern Illinois University was transferred to an independent Board of Trustees concerned solely with NIU.</p>
Six people died in the incident, including the perpetrator, making it the fourth-deadliest university shooting in United States history.</p>

<p><a>right|thumb|Williston Hall</a> The first <a>residence hall</a>s were built to house women only.
<a>Williston Hall</a>, in 1915, was named after Northern's first President, John Williston Cook.
It provided such luxuries for women students as formal table cloths, fresh cut flowers on cafeteria tables, and oriental rugs in the common rooms and was also home to the annual Christmas Ball &ndash; a formal dance in which men wore tuxedos and women wore evening dresses.
Williston Hall was converted into administrative offices in 1969.
It currently houses the Office of Admissions, Records and Registration, Educational Services and Programs, International Admissions, Study Abroad Office, and the Transfer Center.</p>
<p>Adams Hall opened in 1949 and is named for Carl L. Adams, President of NIU from 1929-1948.
Joliet <a>marble</a> shaped in a <a>collegiate Gothic</a> design constitutes the exterior of the building that provided nearly luxurious accommodations, not found on campus today.
Women students were provided with amenities such as furnished linens laundered twice a week, Bavarian china and fine silver for meal service, and silver hollowware for tea each afternoon.
The building was converted for administrative use in 1967.
It currently houses the Graduate School, the Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Testing Services, the Office for Teaching Assistant Training and Development, the Faculty Development and Instructional Design Center and faculty offices.
<p>The first men's dormitory, Gilbert Hall, opened in 1952.
After turning coed, it was also converted to an office building housing the Office of Publications.</p>
Originally for women only, it was built over a period of several years.
Neptune North opened in 1955, Neptune West in 1959, and Neptune East along with Neptune Central, the dining-recreation center, in 1960.
The complex was named for Celine Neptune, another prominent faculty member (1922&#x2013;1948).</p>
<p>The remaining dormitories, located west of Annie Glidden Road, were built in two phases and named for prominent Illinois politicians.
The older two complexes, Lincoln Hall and Douglas Hall, opened in 1962 and 1963.
Each complex consists of four five-story halls which connect to alternating sides of an octagonal one story common building containing a cafeteria and multi-purpose rooms.</p>
<p>Grant Towers opened in 1966.
Stevenson Towers opened in two phases in 1967 and 1968.
They lie to the northwest of Lincoln and Douglas Halls.
Each features four 12-story triangular-shaped towers which connect to a low rise rectangular building housing cafeteria and multi-purpose rooms.
A university bus system serves all of the above residence halls with several stops across campus.</p>
<p>Since the residence halls only provide housing for about a third of the students at NIU, large areas of off-campus housing in close proximity to the campus exist.
There exists a large section of student housing north of campus, including townhomes, apartments and the houses of &quot;Greek Row&quot;, as well as the University Plaza, which offers dorm-style living.
A secondary area of student housing exists in the form of apartment complexes along Lincoln Highway, south of campus.
Facilities that exist on campus to enhance Student Life include the Campus Life Building, which serves as the headquarters for the Student Association, Campus Activities Board, <a><em>Northern Star</em></a> newspaper, and offices for a variety of important groups on campus.
<p>Additional facilities include the Holmes Student Center, which serves as the headquarters for visitors on campus, featuring a hotel, numerous offices, classrooms, meeting rooms, banquet halls, lounges, and a food court anchored by <a>Subway</a>.
A branch of <a>TCF Bank</a> is also located here.
In the basement of the Holmes Student Center is the Huskie's Den, which features bowling lanes, billiards, video games, and other entertainment offerings for students.</p>
<p>On the west side of campus near the residence halls is the sprawling Student Recreation Center, which offers students a weight room, aerobics mats, a gymnasium, and a large room featuring dozens of treadmills as well as more weight machines, <a>elliptical machine</a>s, and also stationary bicycles.
Also on the west side of campus is the recently-built Barsema Alumni and Visitors Center, located just east of Huskie Stadium, which serves as an important visitors center and banquet venue for formal events on campus.</p>
Much of the activity on campus is headquartered out of the Campus Life Building.</p>
<p>The Student Association operates Organizational Expos throughout the year which gives all the organizations on campus the opportunity to showcase their groups and recruit students.</p>
<p>The Campus Activities Board is responsible for bringing activity to the campus, and is also responsible for bringing performers to the <a>Convocation Center</a>.
The Campus Activities Board (C.A.B for short) is responsible for a myriad of different activities geared not only to bring students of N.I.U together but also to give a release from the sometime stressful life of a student, in a creative, fun, and safe environment where students and others can enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>NIU was a member of the <a>Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1920-1967.
<p>On the west side of campus is <a>Brigham Field at Huskie Stadium</a>, the home of NIU football games, which also often hosts other significant outdoor events.
Huskie Stadium, which has a seating capacity over 30,000, is surrounded by large open grassy areas which provide recreation, and also serve as the <a>tailgating</a> lots for football games.
At the Stadium's north end zone is the $14-million Jeffrey and Kimberly Yordon Academic and Athletic Performance Center whose namesakes donated $2.5 million in the fall of 2006 to help with the construction.
The facility opened in August 2007.
<p>On the far west side of campus is the <a>Convocation Center</a>, a state-of-the-art 10,000 seat arena which hosts NIU Men's and Women's Basketball, Gymnastics, Wrestling, and Volleyball, Victor E. Court, games, the opening Convocation Ceremony for incoming freshmen, music concerts, and a variety of events throughout the year including Job Fairs, Internship Fairs, and other expositions.</p>
<p>At the corner of Annie Glidden Road and Lucinda Avenue is the <a>Chick Evans Field House</a>, a building which consists of a series of gymnasiums, which has since been under-used since the basketball team moved to the Convocation Center.
The fieldhouse continues to host expositions and sporting events of a smaller scale, and is the headquarters for the campus <a>ROTC</a> program.</p>
