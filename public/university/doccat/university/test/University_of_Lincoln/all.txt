established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Lincoln</strong> is an <a>English</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Lincolnshire</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was founded in 1992, although its origins can be traced back to the foundation of the <a>Hull</a> <a>School of Art</a> 1861.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The founding of the Brayford Campus in 1996 by <a>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</a>, further revitalised and elevated <a>Lincoln</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Independent describes the university as &quot;the best thing to happen to Lincoln since the Romans&quot;.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The main campus is in the Brayford Pool area of Lincoln and there are further campuses in <a>Riseholme</a>, <a>Holbeach</a> and <a>Hull</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Lincoln's official crest bears the head of <a>Minerva</a>, the <a>Ancient Roman</a> goddess of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Lincoln is the newer of the two Higher Education institutions in Lincoln, the older being <a>Bishop Grosseteste University College</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Development</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Lincoln's roots can be traced back to 1861.
established$$$@@@%%%These can be traced back to a number of higher educational institutions in <a>Hull</a>, including the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), Endsleigh Training College (1905) and the Hull Central College of Commerce (1930).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The higher educational institutions, namely the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), Endsleigh Training College (1905), Hull Central College of Commerce (1930) and <a>Kingston upon Hull College of Education</a> were merged in September 1976 to form the Hull College of Higher Education.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1983 this institution became the Humberside College of Higher Education (&quot;HCHE&quot;) when it absorbed several courses in fishing, food and manufacturing which were running in <a>Grimsby</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%HCHE gained <a>polytechnic</a> status in 1990, and then in 1992 was one of the many polytechnics in the UK to become full universities.</p>

country$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|230px|right|Brayford Pool</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The cathedral city of Lincoln was without its own university until 1992.
established$$$@@@%%%Thus, a university establishment was planned at the southwest end of Lincoln's City centre overlooking the <a>Brayford Pool</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This was to be combined with the existing <a>University of Humberside</a> to form the University of Lincoln, which was originally known as the <strong>University of Lincolnshire and Humberside</strong>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>21st century</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Higher education</a> in Lincoln was consolidated in 2001 when the University acquired <a>Leicester</a>-based <a>De Montfort University</a>'s schools in Lincolnshire: the Lincoln School of Art and Design in uphill Lincoln, and the <a>Lincolnshire School of Agriculture</a>'s sites at Riseholme, <a>Caythorpe</a> and Holbeach.
established$$$@@@%%%Caythorpe was later closed permanently and its activities moved to Riseholme.
established$$$@@@%%%Courses held in <a>Grimsby</a> were also moved to Lincoln around this time.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|upright|University of Lincoln</a> Throughout the late-1990s, the University's sites in Hull were considerably scaled down as the focus shifted towards Lincoln.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2001 this process was taken a step further when the decision was made to move the administrative headquarters and management to Lincoln and to sell the Cottingham Road campus in Hull, the former main campus, to its neighbour, the <a>University of Hull</a> - The site is now the home of the <a>Hull York Medical School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The University still maintains a smaller campus, the Derek Crothall Building, in Hull city centre.
country$$$@@@%%%A smaller campus and student halls on Beverley Road, Hull, were also sold for redevelopment.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As a result of these changes, the '<a>Humberside</a>' was dropped and the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside became the &quot;University of Lincoln&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 28 October 2004, following its redevelopment as a specialist <a>Food science</a> technology park, the campus at Holbeach was reopened by <a>John Henry Hayes</a>, the <a>Member of Parliament</a> for <a>South Holland and the Deepings</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>More recently the University's Forensic Science department has been one of only four Universities in the UK accredited by the <a>Royal Society of Chemistry</a>, and the department's BSc (Hons) Forensic Science course is accredited by the Forensic Science Society.
established$$$@@@%%%The Psychology degree is accredited by the British Psychological Society.
established$$$@@@%%%The Lincoln school of Journalism is also accredited by the BJTC, making it a nationally recognised course among leading broadcasters, including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university received one of the highest scores in the NSS survey as well as recognition for its contribution to research in the Lincolnshire area.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<h3>University of Lincoln Students' Union</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Lincoln Students' Union, (ULSU), was refounded in 2001, along with the university.
established$$$@@@%%%It was formed as a &quot;students' union <a>co-operative</a>&quot;, the first of its kind in the UK.
established$$$@@@%%%All students were required to buy into the membership of the Union, and following a pledge of alliance, were bestowed by the Union a far greater say in the decision-making process.
established$$$@@@%%%Regular member meetings were held, across the various campuses; all student members could, in theory, speak and present motions to be voted on, which would be accepted by the Union, if they were constitutional.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>However, various legislative changes in the UK &#x2013; as well as more practical problems (such as the cost of insuring the Union) &#x2013; meant that the co-operative structure was not viable in the longer term.
established$$$@@@%%%Accordingly, in 2007, the Union was reconstituted as a <a>company limited by guarantee</a>, and <a>registered as a charity</a>, introducing a more conventional governance structure.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%The Students' Union publishes <em>Bullet Magazine</em> six times a year</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>ULSU's All Student Meeting passed a motion at in November 2009 to replace the officer structure with four full-time paid sabbatical officers and nine part-time unpaid officers, from July 2010.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The Engine Shed is home to Students' Union offices and the Student Opportunities, Activity &amp; Participation (SOAP) Centre, the Athletic Union (AU), the UL Careers Centre and the Lincoln University Volunteers Centre (&quot;LUV Shack&quot;).</p>
