<p>   The <strong>University of Buckingham</strong> (UB) is an independent, non-sectarian research and teaching university located in <a>Buckingham</a>, Buckinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Great Ouse.
(Buckingham was the first and only privately funded university in Britain in the 20th century, but in 2010 the new coalition government declared an interest in expanding private higher education, and gave <a>university college</a> status to the American-owned <a>BPP University College of Professional Studies</a>, which unlike Buckingham is a profit-making body.)
As the University is expanding, it has acquired a new site on the west side of the river, hence increasing the capacity of the river-side campus as a whole.
Teaching on some master's degrees takes place in London, in <a>Grosvenor Place</a>, at the home of one its partner institutions: the <a>European School of Economics</a>.
Prominent academics include: philosopher <a>Roger Scruton</a>, philosopher and educationalist <a>Anthony O'Hear</a>, educationalist <a>Alan Smithers</a>, the former Chief Inspector of Schools <a>Chris Woodhead</a>, the cancer specialist <a>Karol Sikora</a>, the historian and political scientist <a>Geoffrey Alderman</a>, and the expert in UK Intelligence Anthony Glees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some of the founding academics migrated from the University of Oxford, disillusioned or wary of aspects of the late 1960s' ethos.
On 27 May 1967, <em><a>The Times</a></em> published a letter from Dr J. W. Paulley, which said: &quot;Is it now time to examine the possibility of creating at least one university in this country on the pattern of [the] great private foundations in the USA&quot;.
<p>Subsequently the university was incorporated as the University College of Buckingham in 1973, and received its <a>Royal Charter</a> from <a>the Queen</a> in 1983.</p>
<p>Its development was influenced by the <a>libertarian</a> <a>Institute of Economic Affairs</a>, in particular, Harry Ferns and <a>Ralph Harris</a>, heads of the Institute.
In keeping with its adherence to a libertarian philosophy, the university's foundation-stone was laid by <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>, who was also to be the university's <a>Chancellor</a> (nominal and ceremonial head) between 1993 and 1998.
The University's first three <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>s were <a>Lord Beloff</a> (1913-1999), former Gladstone Professor of Politics at the University of Oxford;  Sir Alan Peacock, the economist, founder of the Economics department at <a>York University</a>, and Fellow of the <a>British Academy</a>; and Sir Richard Luce, now Lord Luce, the former Minister for the Arts.</p>
Each of these is presided over by a Dean.</p>
<p>One feature of the University that has attracted notice is its continuation of the tradition of &quot;tutorial&quot; teaching (i.e.
very small group teaching) which its founders brought over from the University of Oxford.
<p>The quality of the University's provision is maintained, as at other UK universities, by an external examiner system (i.e., professors from other universities oversee and report on exams and marking), by an academic advisory council (comprising a range of subject-specialist academics from other universities), and by membership of the <a>Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a> (QAA).</p>
<p>The Department of Education has two aspects, research and vocational: it conducts research into education and school provision (see above), and also maintains various PGCE courses, for teacher training.
The Department of Education is home to some of the most prominent educationalists in Britain, including Professor <a>Chris Woodhead</a> (former head of <a>Ofsted</a>), Professor <a>Anthony O'Hear</a> (director of the <a>Royal Institute of Philosophy</a>), and Professor <a>Alan Smithers</a>.
Its <a>postgraduate certificate in education</a> &#x2013; which deals with both the state and the <a>independent sector</a> &#x2013; is accredited with <a>Qualified Teacher Status</a> which means that it also qualifies graduates to teach in the state sector.</p>
<p>Some degree programmes at Buckingham, Law for example, place greater emphasis on exams as an assessment method rather than coursework, but in general its degree programmes balance assessment between exams and coursework.</p>
<p>The cancer specialist <a>Karol Sikora</a> is Dean of the School of Medicine.
The School offers postgraduate <a>MD</a> programmes for qualified doctors in a range of specialisations, but is not approved by the <a>General Medical Council</a> as it does not yet offer an undergraduate medical qualification (<a>Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery</a>).
<p>The School had an association with the <a>alternative medicine</a> community via a Diploma course in <a>integrated medicine</a>.
an alternative medicine lobby group linked to the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>Sikora is very critical of cancer care available on the <a>National Health Service</a>.
During President Obama's campaign for healthcare reform, he appeared in a <a>Republican Party</a> <a>attack ad</a> in the United States criticising the NHS.
The ad led <a>Imperial College</a> to seek legal advice to stop Sikora from claiming to be a professor of cancer medicine at Imperial; a claim that he had made repeatedly over the previous five years.</p>
<p>Professor of Theoretical Medicine at the school is Bruce Charlton, controversial editor of the journal <a>Medical hypotheses</a>, who has recently been dismissed as editor by publisher <a>Elsevier</a> over the publication of a paper by <a>AIDS denial</a>ists claiming that <a>HIV</a> is not responsible for <a>AIDS</a> and concerns over the lack of peer-review at the journal.</p>
<p>Dr <a>Terence Kealey</a>, published an article on 4 June in the <em><a>Daily Telegraph</a></em> newspaper arguing that getting better-funded and more effective universities means charging higher fees.</p>
<p> The University carries out research in a number of disparate areas: in Law, family law and law relating to gender; in the Humanities, <a>Charles Dickens</a>, with the Dickens Journals Online project, and also Biography and Life-writing; in Business, particularly entrepreneurship; in Science, particularly diabetes, obesity, and metabolic research, at the Clore Laboratory; face recognition systems, within Applied Computing; and Intelligence issues, within the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies.
The centre moved from Brunel University to Buckingham in 2007.</p>
This is under the directorship of <a>Alan Smithers</a> and Dr Pamela Robinson, and investigates &quot;the current state of education for policymakers, practitioners and others who make education happen&quot;.</p>
<p>Dickens Journals Online, which is run from within the Department of English, aims to make available free, for schools, universities, and others, a complete online edition of Charles Dickens's weekly magazines, <em>Household Words</em> and <em>All the Year Round</em>.
When completed, it will make available, to a wide audience, a rich slice of nineteenth-century literature, opinion, information, and history.
Dr John Drew, of the department of English, has been awarded a Leverhulme Fellowship (2009-11) to further the project.</p>
<p>The Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, which runs an MA in this field, is prominent in recent debates concerning Muslim radicalisation in the UK and the role of the intelligence forces in this area.</p>
<p>The University was ranked 27th out of 115 universities in <em><a>Times Higher Education</a>'s</em> &quot;Table of Tables&quot; 2010.
In 2010, <em>The Independent</em>, in association with its <em>Complete University Guide 2010-11</em>, ranked Buckingham as the 20th best university out of 115 institutions in the UK.
The <em><a>Sunday Times</a></em> University guide for 2010 included Buckingham in its league tables in 48th position out of 122 UK higher education institutes stating that: &quot;we rank the private University of Buckingham for the first time in our main league table this year.
<p><em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> reported that the University's 2008 graduates had the highest employment rate after six months.</p>
This is a census, albeit <a>controversial</a>, of final-year undergraduates conducted by IposMori, the polling organisation, to determine satisfaction levels at UK universities.
The survey relates to the whole student experience, from the experience of classes, and lecturer feedback, to the quality of pastoral care.
In 2009, the University of Buckingham dropped to second place and in 2010 returned to first place.</p>
<p>The league tables of individual university departments in <em>The Guardian University Guide 2010</em>, produced by <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> newspaper, ranked English at Buckingham as 15th out of 97 UK departments, Business as 20th out of 113 departments, and Law as 23rd out of 89 departments.
The updating of these league tables, in <em>The Guardian University Guide 2011</em>, ranks Business as the second-best department in the UK, English as the 6th, and Law as the 24th.</p>
<p>When the national Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) was created, the University felt it should join, even though - as Britain&#x2019;s only independent University &#x2013; it is markedly different from the state-funded universities that the QAA otherwise audits.</p>
<p>The University has emerged as a critic of the QAA.
Professor Geoffrey Alderman, in his inaugural lecture at the University of Buckingham <em>Teaching Quality Assessment, League Tables and the Decline of Academic Standards in British Higher Education</em> demonstrated that degree inflation had taken off in the 10 years of the QAA&#x2019;s existence.
<p>The University got &quot;broad confidence&quot; (the highest band) in its first QAA audit in 2003.
<p>&quot;limited confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the University's current and likely future management of the academic standards of its awards&quot; and also that &quot;confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the University's current and likely future management of the quality of the learning opportunities available to students.&quot;
<p>The University's Vice-Chancellor, Dr Terence Kealey, commented on the QAA report in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> magazine on 16 September 2008, followed a week later by a lead letter from the Chief Executive of the QAA and an article by Melanie Newman in the same issue.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Dr Kealey discussed the QAA in a feature article in the <a>Guardian</a> newspaper.
A week later the Chief Executive of QAA and Professor Gill Evans responded in the same paper.
The Vice-Chancellor, Dr Terence Kealey, then wrote a further article for the Guardian newspaper linking the QAA inspection regime with degree inflation which has so undermined UK Higher Education that the Burgess Report recommends abandoning classed degrees altogether.
<p>In June 2009 Dr Kealey wrote a further article, published on 4 June in <a>The Independent</a> newspaper, arguing that the QAA should be incorporated into Hefce and a new Standards Assurance Agency should be set up.</p>
<p>The University's criticisms of QAA and  of the regulatory regime have been endorsed by the House of Commons Select Committee as discussed in <a>The Times</a> newspaper by Professor Geoffrey Alderman on 4 August 2009.</p>
<p>Honorary graduates include:  the Rt Hon <a>Frank Field</a>, the Labour MP; Sir <a>Steven Redgrave</a>, the Olympic oarsman; <a>Baroness Noakes</a>, the Conservative politician (opponent of Identity cards);  <a>Sir Stuart Hampson</a>, former head of the John Lewis Partnership; <a>Sir Christopher Ondaatje</a>, the publisher, writer, and philanthropist; and the journalist <a>Charles Moore</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a>BBC Radio 4</a> <a>panel game</a> <em><a>The Museum of Curiosity</a></em>, host <a>John Lloyd</a> claims to be, &quot;The Professor of Ignorance at the University of Buckingham&quot;.</p>
<p>The University awards undergraduate and graduate (Masters/MBA) degrees to students who have studied at the <a>European School of Economics</a> and at the <a>Sarajevo School of Science and Technology</a>.</p>
<p>The immediate past- Chancellor is Sir <a>Martin Jacomb</a>, Chairman of <a>Canary Wharf Group</a> PLC, and Share PLC (in Aylesbury), and the director of other companies including Oxford Playhouse Trust.
He was Chairman of <a>Prudential</a> PLC from 1995 to 2000 and last year retired from the boards of <a>Rio Tinto Group</a> and <a>Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.
Former Chancellors of the university have been <a>Margaret Thatcher</a> who retired in 1999, and <a>Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone</a>.</p>
<p><a>Lord Tanlaw</a> was appointed to succeed Sir Martin as Chancellor in May 2010.</p>
<p>The current Vice-Chancellor is Dr Terence Kealey, formerly of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Cambridge University, who has held the post since April 2001.
He wrote an academic book on the subject in 1996 The Economic Laws of Scientific Research which he repackaged and updated for a general audience in 2008 as Sex, Science and Profits.
The <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> had commissioned, for its issue of 17 September 2009, seven articles of 500 words each on the seven deadly sins of academia.
The seven sins were <em>sartorial inelegance, procrastination, snobbery, lust, arrogance, complacency</em> and <em>pedantry,</em> and the commissioning editor, Matthew Reisz, wrote that the contributors &quot;entered into the spirit and offered amusing examples of their sins in action &#x2026;&quot;.
The illustrations in the magazine reflected the humour of the feature.
Kealey wrote on <em>lust,</em> and he adopted a satirical tone, claiming that young female students were a &quot;perk&quot; for male academics and they should &quot;look but not touch&quot;.
On 23 September the London Daily Telegraph ran a story about the article and the backlash was swift from academics.
Kealey was criticised by the <a>University and College Union</a> and the <a>National Union of Students</a> who said his comments displayed an &#x201c;astounding lack of respect for women&#x201d;.
At the same time Kealey was defended by scholars such as Professor Mary Beard of Cambridge University who in her online blog for the <em><a>Times</a></em> newspaper wrote that it was instantly clear that the piece was satire.
Kealey wrote a defence of his piece in the Daily Telegraph and he was also defended by the editor of the THE but nonetheless he wrote a piece in the Times Education Supplement three weeks later in which he said that it is a mistake for a scholar to write ambiguously, which must generally preclude the use of satire, irony, humour or parody in academic writing.
