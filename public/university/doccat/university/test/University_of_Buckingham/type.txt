Buckingham's funding regime is not like that of other UK universities, but rather is on the model of many US universities, as it does not receive direct state funding.
Buckingham offers <a>bachelor's degrees</a>, <a>master's degrees</a>, and <a>doctoral degrees</a> through five schools of study.</p>
<p>The University was created as a <a>liberal arts college</a>, and the major humanities subjects such as <a>history</a> and <a>politics</a> are offered with <a>economics</a> as a degree in international studies.
So too is <a>English literature</a>, as a single honours subject, and in combinations with English Language, or Journalism, and related areas.
The Professor of Economics, and Dean of Humanities, Professor Martin Ricketts, is the chair of the <a>Institute of Economic Affairs</a> Academic Advisory Council.</p>
Karol Sikora is a Foundation Fellow of <a>Prince Charles</a>' now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group the <a>Foundation for Integrated Health</a> and Chair of the <em>Faculty of Integrated Medicine</em>, which is unaffiliated with any university but also includes Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson, who co-ordinated Buckingham's &quot;integrated medicine&quot; course.
<p>The School of Business is an Accredited Study Centre for <a>Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2009, the university does not rank in the top 600 universities globally as rated by <a>Quacquarelli Symonds</a> and <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em>; nor does it rank in the top 500 universities rated by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> in 2010.
However, it is ranked at 4,420 in the 2010 <a>Webometrics Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>
<p>The University's Royal Charter, unlike those of other universities, provides for three sovereign bodies, the third one (in addition to the usual Council and Senate) being the Academic Advisory Council, which is a group of external academics that audits the academic staff.</p>
<p>Prominent alumni include: <a>Bader Ben Hirsi</a>, <a>Susanne Klatten</a>, <a>Michael Misick</a>, <a>Brandon Lewis</a>, <a>Olagunsoye Oyinlola</a>, and <a>Mark Lancaster</a>, the MP for Milton Keynes North.</p>
Kealey is known for his research challenging the idea that education and science are public goods needing public subsidies.
