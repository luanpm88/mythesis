Students at Buckingham study for eight terms over two years, rather than nine terms over three, which (with extra teaching) fits a three-year degree into two years.
From September 2009, tuition fees for full-time UK and EU <a>undergraduate</a> students will be &#x00a3;8,040 per year for these two-year <a>Bachelor's degree</a> programmes.
For this same reason, Buckingham may be absent from other rankings based on, or which require, this measure.
