established$$$@@@%%%<p>   The <strong>University of Buckingham</strong> (UB) is an independent, non-sectarian research and teaching university located in <a>Buckingham</a>, Buckinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Great Ouse.
type$$$@@@%%%Buckingham's funding regime is not like that of other UK universities, but rather is on the model of many US universities, as it does not receive direct state funding.
established$$$@@@%%%(Buckingham was the first and only privately funded university in Britain in the 20th century, but in 2010 the new coalition government declared an interest in expanding private higher education, and gave <a>university college</a> status to the American-owned <a>BPP University College of Professional Studies</a>, which unlike Buckingham is a profit-making body.)
type$$$@@@%%%Buckingham offers <a>bachelor's degrees</a>, <a>master's degrees</a>, and <a>doctoral degrees</a> through five schools of study.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The 'Schools' (or Faculties) of Law and Science are situated in the upper campus; the river-side campus covers Humanities, Business, Social Sciences, Biomedical science, and Education.
established$$$@@@%%%As the University is expanding, it has acquired a new site on the west side of the river, hence increasing the capacity of the river-side campus as a whole.
established$$$@@@%%%Teaching on some master's degrees takes place in London, in <a>Grosvenor Place</a>, at the home of one its partner institutions: the <a>European School of Economics</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Prominent academics include: philosopher <a>Roger Scruton</a>, philosopher and educationalist <a>Anthony O'Hear</a>, educationalist <a>Alan Smithers</a>, the former Chief Inspector of Schools <a>Chris Woodhead</a>, the cancer specialist <a>Karol Sikora</a>, the historian and political scientist <a>Geoffrey Alderman</a>, and the expert in UK Intelligence Anthony Glees.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Some of the founding academics migrated from the University of Oxford, disillusioned or wary of aspects of the late 1960s' ethos.
established$$$@@@%%%On 27 May 1967, <em><a>The Times</a></em> published a letter from Dr J. W. Paulley, which said: &quot;Is it now time to examine the possibility of creating at least one university in this country on the pattern of [the] great private foundations in the USA&quot;.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Three London conferences followed which explored this idea.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Subsequently the university was incorporated as the University College of Buckingham in 1973, and received its <a>Royal Charter</a> from <a>the Queen</a> in 1983.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Its development was influenced by the <a>libertarian</a> <a>Institute of Economic Affairs</a>, in particular, Harry Ferns and <a>Ralph Harris</a>, heads of the Institute.
established$$$@@@%%%In keeping with its adherence to a libertarian philosophy, the university's foundation-stone was laid by <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>, who was also to be the university's <a>Chancellor</a> (nominal and ceremonial head) between 1993 and 1998.
established$$$@@@%%%The University's first three <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>s were <a>Lord Beloff</a> (1913-1999), former Gladstone Professor of Politics at the University of Oxford;  Sir Alan Peacock, the economist, founder of the Economics department at <a>York University</a>, and Fellow of the <a>British Academy</a>; and Sir Richard Luce, now Lord Luce, the former Minister for the Arts.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Teaching</h2>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The University's four schools are Law, Humanities, Business, and Science and Medicine.
established$$$@@@%%%Each of these is presided over by a Dean.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>One feature of the University that has attracted notice is its continuation of the tradition of &quot;tutorial&quot; teaching (i.e.
established$$$@@@%%%very small group teaching) which its founders brought over from the University of Oxford.
students$$$@@@%%%While there are seminars and lectures, much of the teaching is done in small groups of 4 to 8 students, with one member of staff.
students$$$@@@%%%The staff-student ratio is 1:7.8, which is high among UK universities.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Times Good University Guide (2009) notes that &quot;one-to-one tutorials, which have almost died out elsewhere, with the exception of Oxbridge...are quite common at Buckingham&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The quality of the University's provision is maintained, as at other UK universities, by an external examiner system (i.e., professors from other universities oversee and report on exams and marking), by an academic advisory council (comprising a range of subject-specialist academics from other universities), and by membership of the <a>Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a> (QAA).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Department of Education has two aspects, research and vocational: it conducts research into education and school provision (see above), and also maintains various PGCE courses, for teacher training.
established$$$@@@%%%The Department of Education is home to some of the most prominent educationalists in Britain, including Professor <a>Chris Woodhead</a> (former head of <a>Ofsted</a>), Professor <a>Anthony O'Hear</a> (director of the <a>Royal Institute of Philosophy</a>), and Professor <a>Alan Smithers</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Its <a>postgraduate certificate in education</a> &#x2013; which deals with both the state and the <a>independent sector</a> &#x2013; is accredited with <a>Qualified Teacher Status</a> which means that it also qualifies graduates to teach in the state sector.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>The University was created as a <a>liberal arts college</a>, and the major humanities subjects such as <a>history</a> and <a>politics</a> are offered with <a>economics</a> as a degree in international studies.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Economics, however, is available as a stand-alone degree.
type$$$@@@%%%So too is <a>English literature</a>, as a single honours subject, and in combinations with English Language, or Journalism, and related areas.
type$$$@@@%%%The Professor of Economics, and Dean of Humanities, Professor Martin Ricketts, is the chair of the <a>Institute of Economic Affairs</a> Academic Advisory Council.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Some degree programmes at Buckingham, Law for example, place greater emphasis on exams as an assessment method rather than coursework, but in general its degree programmes balance assessment between exams and coursework.</p>
head_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>School of Medicine</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The cancer specialist <a>Karol Sikora</a> is Dean of the School of Medicine.
established$$$@@@%%%The School offers postgraduate <a>MD</a> programmes for qualified doctors in a range of specialisations, but is not approved by the <a>General Medical Council</a> as it does not yet offer an undergraduate medical qualification (<a>Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery</a>).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The School had an association with the <a>alternative medicine</a> community via a Diploma course in <a>integrated medicine</a>.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%This was later withdrawn under pressure from alternative medicine campaigner <a>David Colquhoun</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%Karol Sikora is a Foundation Fellow of <a>Prince Charles</a>' now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group the <a>Foundation for Integrated Health</a> and Chair of the <em>Faculty of Integrated Medicine</em>, which is unaffiliated with any university but also includes Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson, who co-ordinated Buckingham's &quot;integrated medicine&quot; course.
established$$$@@@%%%an alternative medicine lobby group linked to the Prince of Wales.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sikora is very critical of cancer care available on the <a>National Health Service</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%During President Obama's campaign for healthcare reform, he appeared in a <a>Republican Party</a> <a>attack ad</a> in the United States criticising the NHS.
established$$$@@@%%%The ad led <a>Imperial College</a> to seek legal advice to stop Sikora from claiming to be a professor of cancer medicine at Imperial; a claim that he had made repeatedly over the previous five years.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Professor of Theoretical Medicine at the school is Bruce Charlton, controversial editor of the journal <a>Medical hypotheses</a>, who has recently been dismissed as editor by publisher <a>Elsevier</a> over the publication of a paper by <a>AIDS denial</a>ists claiming that <a>HIV</a> is not responsible for <a>AIDS</a> and concerns over the lack of peer-review at the journal.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h2>Degrees: timescale and cost</h2>
affiliation$$$@@@%%%<p>The university offers traditional <a>degrees</a> over a shorter time-frame.
staff$$$@@@%%%Students at Buckingham study for eight terms over two years, rather than nine terms over three, which (with extra teaching) fits a three-year degree into two years.
staff$$$@@@%%%From September 2009, tuition fees for full-time UK and EU <a>undergraduate</a> students will be &#x00a3;8,040 per year for these two-year <a>Bachelor's degree</a> programmes.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%For non-EU students, fees will be equivalent to &#x00a3;13,500 p.a.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Because Buckingham's degrees take only two years to complete, the university views its courses as cost-effective compared to ordinary UK university courses, once living expenses and the income from an extra year's employment are taken into account.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Dr <a>Terence Kealey</a>, published an article on 4 June in the <em><a>Daily Telegraph</a></em> newspaper arguing that getting better-funded and more effective universities means charging higher fees.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h2>Research</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> The University carries out research in a number of disparate areas: in Law, family law and law relating to gender; in the Humanities, <a>Charles Dickens</a>, with the Dickens Journals Online project, and also Biography and Life-writing; in Business, particularly entrepreneurship; in Science, particularly diabetes, obesity, and metabolic research, at the Clore Laboratory; face recognition systems, within Applied Computing; and Intelligence issues, within the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies.
established$$$@@@%%%The centre moved from Brunel University to Buckingham in 2007.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>Education research takes place at the Centre for Education and Employment Research within the Department of Education.
established$$$@@@%%%This is under the directorship of <a>Alan Smithers</a> and Dr Pamela Robinson, and investigates &quot;the current state of education for policymakers, practitioners and others who make education happen&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Dickens Journals Online, which is run from within the Department of English, aims to make available free, for schools, universities, and others, a complete online edition of Charles Dickens's weekly magazines, <em>Household Words</em> and <em>All the Year Round</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%When completed, it will make available, to a wide audience, a rich slice of nineteenth-century literature, opinion, information, and history.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr John Drew, of the department of English, has been awarded a Leverhulme Fellowship (2009-11) to further the project.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>The School of Business is an Accredited Study Centre for <a>Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, which runs an MA in this field, is prominent in recent debates concerning Muslim radicalisation in the UK and the role of the intelligence forces in this area.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>League tables</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>UK ranking</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University was ranked 27th out of 115 universities in <em><a>Times Higher Education</a>'s</em> &quot;Table of Tables&quot; 2010.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2010, <em>The Independent</em>, in association with its <em>Complete University Guide 2010-11</em>, ranked Buckingham as the 20th best university out of 115 institutions in the UK.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em><a>Sunday Times</a></em> University guide for 2010 included Buckingham in its league tables in 48th position out of 122 UK higher education institutes stating that: &quot;we rank the private University of Buckingham for the first time in our main league table this year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Top for student satisfaction, with the lowest level of graduate unemployment, the best student/staff ratio and the lowest drop-out rate compared to benchmark.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Buckingham makes quite an entrance ...&quot; Confusingly, the same publisher does not include Buckingham in its <a>Good University Guide</a> because Buckingham receives no state funding and therefore does not participate in the government's <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>, which forms part of the <em>Times</em> ranking criteria (but not the <em>Sunday Times</em>).
staff$$$@@@%%%For this same reason, Buckingham may be absent from other rankings based on, or which require, this measure.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> reported that the University's 2008 graduates had the highest employment rate after six months.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In recent years the University has consistently ranked highly in student satisfaction surveys.
country$$$@@@%%%For example, Times Higher Education reported that Buckingham was ranked first in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the NSS or <a>National Student Survey</a> of student satisfaction.
established$$$@@@%%%This is a census, albeit <a>controversial</a>, of final-year undergraduates conducted by IposMori, the polling organisation, to determine satisfaction levels at UK universities.
established$$$@@@%%%The survey relates to the whole student experience, from the experience of classes, and lecturer feedback, to the quality of pastoral care.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2009, the University of Buckingham dropped to second place and in 2010 returned to first place.</p>
free$$$@@@%%%<h3>Department rankings</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The league tables of individual university departments in <em>The Guardian University Guide 2010</em>, produced by <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> newspaper, ranked English at Buckingham as 15th out of 97 UK departments, Business as 20th out of 113 departments, and Law as 23rd out of 89 departments.
established$$$@@@%%%The updating of these league tables, in <em>The Guardian University Guide 2011</em>, ranks Business as the second-best department in the UK, English as the 6th, and Law as the 24th.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Global ranking</h3>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>As of 2009, the university does not rank in the top 600 universities globally as rated by <a>Quacquarelli Symonds</a> and <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em>; nor does it rank in the top 500 universities rated by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> in 2010.
type$$$@@@%%%However, it is ranked at 4,420 in the 2010 <a>Webometrics Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Quality</h2>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>The University's Royal Charter, unlike those of other universities, provides for three sovereign bodies, the third one (in addition to the usual Council and Senate) being the Academic Advisory Council, which is a group of external academics that audits the academic staff.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When the national Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) was created, the University felt it should join, even though - as Britain&#x2019;s only independent University &#x2013; it is markedly different from the state-funded universities that the QAA otherwise audits.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University has emerged as a critic of the QAA.
established$$$@@@%%%Professor Geoffrey Alderman, in his inaugural lecture at the University of Buckingham <em>Teaching Quality Assessment, League Tables and the Decline of Academic Standards in British Higher Education</em> demonstrated that degree inflation had taken off in the 10 years of the QAA&#x2019;s existence.
mascot$$$@@@%%%This lecture provoked a wide national debate  which encouraged the House of Commons Select Committee to review quality and related issues.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University got &quot;broad confidence&quot; (the highest band) in its first QAA audit in 2003.
president$$$@@@%%%In 2008 the QAA said that:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%  <p>&quot;limited confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the University's current and likely future management of the academic standards of its awards&quot; and also that &quot;confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the University's current and likely future management of the quality of the learning opportunities available to students.&quot;
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</blockquote>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University's Vice-Chancellor, Dr Terence Kealey, commented on the QAA report in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> magazine on 16 September 2008, followed a week later by a lead letter from the Chief Executive of the QAA and an article by Melanie Newman in the same issue.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A few weeks later, Dr Kealey discussed the QAA in a feature article in the <a>Guardian</a> newspaper.
established$$$@@@%%%A week later the Chief Executive of QAA and Professor Gill Evans responded in the same paper.
established$$$@@@%%%The Vice-Chancellor, Dr Terence Kealey, then wrote a further article for the Guardian newspaper linking the QAA inspection regime with degree inflation which has so undermined UK Higher Education that the Burgess Report recommends abandoning classed degrees altogether.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In June 2009 Dr Kealey wrote a further article, published on 4 June in <a>The Independent</a> newspaper, arguing that the QAA should be incorporated into Hefce and a new Standards Assurance Agency should be set up.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University's criticisms of QAA and  of the regulatory regime have been endorsed by the House of Commons Select Committee as discussed in <a>The Times</a> newspaper by Professor Geoffrey Alderman on 4 August 2009.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The immediate past- Chancellor is Sir <a>Martin Jacomb</a>, Chairman of <a>Canary Wharf Group</a> PLC, and Share PLC (in Aylesbury), and the director of other companies including Oxford Playhouse Trust.
established$$$@@@%%%He was Chairman of <a>Prudential</a> PLC from 1995 to 2000 and last year retired from the boards of <a>Rio Tinto Group</a> and <a>Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Former Chancellors of the university have been <a>Margaret Thatcher</a> who retired in 1999, and <a>Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Lord Tanlaw</a> was appointed to succeed Sir Martin as Chancellor in May 2010.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The current Vice-Chancellor is Dr Terence Kealey, formerly of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Cambridge University, who has held the post since April 2001.
type$$$@@@%%%Kealey is known for his research challenging the idea that education and science are public goods needing public subsidies.
established$$$@@@%%%He wrote an academic book on the subject in 1996 The Economic Laws of Scientific Research which he repackaged and updated for a general audience in 2008 as Sex, Science and Profits.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>Kealey sparked a sexism row in September 2009.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> had commissioned, for its issue of 17 September 2009, seven articles of 500 words each on the seven deadly sins of academia.
established$$$@@@%%%The seven sins were <em>sartorial inelegance, procrastination, snobbery, lust, arrogance, complacency</em> and <em>pedantry,</em> and the commissioning editor, Matthew Reisz, wrote that the contributors &quot;entered into the spirit and offered amusing examples of their sins in action &#x2026;&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The illustrations in the magazine reflected the humour of the feature.
established$$$@@@%%%Kealey wrote on <em>lust,</em> and he adopted a satirical tone, claiming that young female students were a &quot;perk&quot; for male academics and they should &quot;look but not touch&quot;.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Over the next week the <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> website filled with comments about the article, many expressing shock but some expressing support.
established$$$@@@%%%On 23 September the London Daily Telegraph ran a story about the article and the backlash was swift from academics.
established$$$@@@%%%Kealey was criticised by the <a>University and College Union</a> and the <a>National Union of Students</a> who said his comments displayed an &#x201c;astounding lack of respect for women&#x201d;.
established$$$@@@%%%At the same time Kealey was defended by scholars such as Professor Mary Beard of Cambridge University who in her online blog for the <em><a>Times</a></em> newspaper wrote that it was instantly clear that the piece was satire.
established$$$@@@%%%Kealey wrote a defence of his piece in the Daily Telegraph and he was also defended by the editor of the THE but nonetheless he wrote a piece in the Times Education Supplement three weeks later in which he said that it is a mistake for a scholar to write ambiguously, which must generally preclude the use of satire, irony, humour or parody in academic writing.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>In February 2010, Kealey proposed the establishment of a new independent university, modelled on American liberal arts colleges, that would concentrate on undergraduate teaching rather than research.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The plan is currently being considered by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), whose 243 members include independent schools such as Eton, Winchester and St Paul's.
country$$$@@@%%%Kealey believes that complaints about impersonal teaching and oversized classes at many traditional universities mean there will be strong demand for higher education with staff-student ratios similar to that provided by independent secondary schools.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>University of Buckingham Press</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Buckingham Press publishes in the areas of law, education, and business through its journal articles, books, reports and other material.
