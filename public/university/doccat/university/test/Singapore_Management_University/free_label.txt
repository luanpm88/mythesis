<p>Admission to the undergraduate programmes is based on criteria that include GCE A-Level or Polytechnic grades, an interview and extra-curricular achievements or work experience.
Under this agreement, the two universities also increased their focus on collaborative research efforts leading to joint faculty research outputs, funded projects and graduate student interaction.</p>
