<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Normal School for Colored Girls</a> was established in 1851 and by 1879, the name was changed to &quot;Miner Normal School&quot;.
Washington Normal School was established in 1873 for girls, and renamed the &quot;Wilson Normal School&quot; in 1913.
In 1929, the <a>United States Congress</a> made both schools four-year teachers' colleges and renamed as &quot;Miner Teachers College&quot; for <a>African Americans</a> and &quot;Wilson Teachers College&quot; for whites.
In 1955, the two schools merged and were renamed the &quot;District of Columbia Teachers College&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1967, Congress awarded the University of the District of Columbia  <a>land-grant status</a> and a $7.24 million endowment (USD), in lieu of a land grant.</p>
A new <a>Community College of the District of Columbia</a> (CCDC) assumed UDC's Associate Degree, Certificate, Continuing Education and Workforce Development programs with UDC going forward with just its  bachelor and graduate degree programs.
<p>The UDC's <a>adult education</a> department had a collegial relationship with the <a>University of Nairobi</a> for several years, including faculty exchange and doctoral student sponsoring.</p>
<p>The main (Van Ness) campus of UDC is located at <a>Connecticut Avenue</a> and Van Ness St. in <a>Northwest Washington, DC</a>.
UDC is primarily a commuter school and opened its first residential accommodations or <a>dormitories</a> in August 2010 by leasing an apartment building  across the street from its campus.
UDC plans to open a new residence hall on its main campus by 2012 that could house as many as 300 students.</p>
