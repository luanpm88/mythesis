image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding</h3>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|Signers' Hall</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Alaska was established in 1917 as a college, but its origins lie in the creation in 1906 of a federal <a>agricultural experiment station</a> in Fairbanks, the sixth in Alaska.
established$$$@@@%%%The station set the tone for the university that developed later, which is strongly research-oriented.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1915, the <a>U.S. Congress</a> approved funds to establish a school of higher education and transferred land from the station for the purpose.
established$$$@@@%%%The federal land grant was accepted by Territorial Governor <a>John Strong</a> in 1917.
established$$$@@@%%%That year, on a bluff above the Chena River, a cornerstone for the college was laid by Territorial Delegate <a>James Wickersham</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The site became known as College Hill.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Charles E. Bunnell</a> was appointed the university's first president, serving for 27 years.
established$$$@@@%%%The new institution was established as the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines in 1922, offering 16 classes to a student body of six (at a ratio of one faculty member per student).
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%In 1923 the first <a>commencement</a> produced one graduate, John Sexton Shanly.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1931, the rest of the <a>Alaska Agricultural Experiment Station</a> was transferred to the college, and the Alaska Territorial Legislature changed the name in 1935 to the University of Alaska.
established$$$@@@%%%As the university began to expand throughout the state, the Fairbanks campus became known as the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1975; the two other primary UA institutions are the <a>University of Alaska Anchorage</a> and the <a>University of Alaska Southeast</a> in Juneau.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%The University's Board of Regents named the building Constitution Hall the same month as the convention's opening.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks</strong> or <strong>ASUAF</strong> is the representative group for the students attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the fall and spring semesters, each student enrolled in three or more credit-hours pays a $35 fee to ASUAF, which lobbies the university administration and occasionally the state Legislature.
type$$$@@@%%%During the summer semester the fee is $10.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Students elect a president, vice-president, and up to 20 senators to the student government.
chancellor$$$@@@%%%The president and vice-president are elected in the spring for one year terms.

established$$$@@@%%%The senate appoints a senate chair at the beginning of the academic year.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Elections</h3>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>Although recognized as the official student governing body at UAF, ASUAF elections typically draw about 5 percent voter turnout, low when compared to local and state elections.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The elections also draw their share of controversy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1995, a ballot box turned up a month after the election, uncounted, in police custody; a recount resulted in new senators being inducted, and then-President Joe Hayes nearly was impeached.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>An electronic system was set-up for the fall 2002 elections, which officials at the time said would cut down on election problems.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time, officials said that since students could vote in the privacy of their rooms, it would be impossible to enforce <a>electioneering</a> claims.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Consequently, rules regarding electioneering were done away with.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>But in April 2004, incumbent President Thom Walker brought forward electioneering claims after his opponent, Brandon Maitlen, won the election by 43 votes.
established$$$@@@%%%Walker claimed Maitlen had bribed voters with hamburgers during an election day <a>barbecue</a> and had blared music and occasionally his voice too close to polls.
nickname$$$@@@%%%An oversight board dismissed the bribery charge, but agreed the sound system unduly influenced voters.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The board called for a new election, but Maitlen contested, charging the board with impropriety.
established$$$@@@%%%A new board was formed, but it did no good&#x2014;the board disqualified Maitlen, making Walker the winner.</p>
head_label$$$@@@%%%<p>Recent elections have been quieter affairs.
country$$$@@@%%%In the spring 2005 presidential elections, turnout increased 1.2 percent to 379 voters, or about 6 percent of the eligible student population.</p>
