<p> The <strong>University of Alaska Fairbanks</strong>, located in <a>Fairbanks</a>, <a>Alaska</a>, USA, is the flagship campus of the <a>University of Alaska System</a>, and is abbreviated as <strong>Alaska</strong> or <strong>UAF</strong>. UAF is a <a>land-grant</a>, <a>sea-grant</a>, and <a>space-grant</a> institution, as well as participating in the <a>sun-grant</a> program through Oregon State University.
It is also the site where the <a>Alaska Constitution</a> was drafted and signed in 1955 and 1956.
UAF was established in 1917 as the <strong>Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines</strong>, first opening for classes in 1922.</p>
The <a>University of Alaska Museum of the North</a> is also on the Fairbanks campus.</p>
<p>In addition to the Fairbanks campus, UAF encompasses seven rural and urban campuses: <a>Bristol Bay Campus</a> in <a>Dillingham</a>; <a>Chukchi Campus</a> in <a>Kotzebue</a>; <a>Interior-Aleutians Campus</a>, which covers both the <a>Aleutian Islands</a> and the Interior; <a>Kuskokwim Campus</a> in <a>Bethel</a>; <a>Northwest Campus</a> in <a>Nome</a>; and the <a>UAF Community and Technical College</a> in Fairbanks, UAF's community college arm.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Alaska was established in 1917 as a college, but its origins lie in the creation in 1906 of a federal <a>agricultural experiment station</a> in Fairbanks, the sixth in Alaska.
The station set the tone for the university that developed later, which is strongly research-oriented.
In 1915, the <a>U.S. Congress</a> approved funds to establish a school of higher education and transferred land from the station for the purpose.
The federal land grant was accepted by Territorial Governor <a>John Strong</a> in 1917.
That year, on a bluff above the Chena River, a cornerstone for the college was laid by Territorial Delegate <a>James Wickersham</a>.
<a>Charles E. Bunnell</a> was appointed the university's first president, serving for 27 years.
The new institution was established as the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines in 1922, offering 16 classes to a student body of six (at a ratio of one faculty member per student).
<p>In 1931, the rest of the <a>Alaska Agricultural Experiment Station</a> was transferred to the college, and the Alaska Territorial Legislature changed the name in 1935 to the University of Alaska.
As the university began to expand throughout the state, the Fairbanks campus became known as the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1975; the two other primary UA institutions are the <a>University of Alaska Anchorage</a> and the <a>University of Alaska Southeast</a> in Juneau.</p>
<p>The <a>Alaska Constitution</a>al Convention was held on the university campus from November 1955 to February 1956.
The student union building, which was completed the same day the convention opened, was used for the convention's sessions.
The University's Board of Regents named the building Constitution Hall the same month as the convention's opening.
The campus library and gymnasium building, where the constitution was signed, was named Signers' Hall in the 1980s.
Today, Signers' Hall houses the Office of Admissions and the Registrar, the Business Office, the Provost's Office and the Office of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>Students can choose from more than 165 degrees and 30 certificates in more than 125 disciplines.</p>
<li>BioSciences Library (physically housed in the Institute of Arctic Biology, but administratively part of the Rasmuson Library)</li>
<p>UAF is Alaska's primary research university, conducting over 90% of all the research done throughout the UA system.
<li>the <a>Geophysical Institute</a>, established in 1946 by an Act of Congress, which specializes in <a>seismological</a>, <a>volcanologic</a> and <a>aeronomy</a> research, among other fields</li>
<li>the Institute of Northern Engineering</li>
<li>the Institute of Arctic Biology</li>
The Office of Sustainability was created in 2010 and recently hired a sustainability coordinator.
The Alaska Nanooks compete at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> level for hockey as a member of the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>.
Partly due to its isolation from the <a>lower 48</a> and lack of a dome to protect against the harsh elements, Alaska does not currently have a football program, as is true for all three branches of the University of Alaska.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Since the UAF athletics program was operating at a financial deficit for several years prior, a new student fee was initiated in 2008 to keep the program alive.
<p>The department has increased scholarships for women by 95 percent since 2005, and was even recognized by the Chronicle of Higher Education for Title IX compliance in an article titled &quot;Turnaround Stories.&quot;</p>
<p>There are several <a>book publishers</a> at UAF, including the <a>University of Alaska Press</a>, the <a>Alaska Native Language Center</a>, <a>Alaska Sea Grant</a>, the University of Alaska Museum of the North, Cooperative Extension Service, and the <a>Alaska Native Knowledge Network</a>.
The <a>University of Alaska Foundation</a> also publishes <a>book</a>s.</p>
<p>Magazines include <em>Aurora</em>, a twice-annual produced by Marketing and Communications;<em><a>Frontiers</a></em>, a twice-annual produced by the Center for Research Services;<em><a>Agroborealis</a></em>, a twice-annual produced by the School of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences; <em><a>Challenges in Science and Engineering</a></em>, an annual produced by the <a>Arctic Region Supercomputing Center</a>; <em><a>Ice Box</a></em>, the UAF student <a>literary magazine</a>; and <em><a>Permafrost</a></em>, the UAF English department's literary magazine.
<p>The university hosts a Fine Arts complex, one room of which is named after long-time local chorister <a>Eva McGown</a>.
UAF offers an extensive Native Arts program, directed by <a>Alvin Amason</a>.</p>
<p>As well as art, UAF offers MFA degrees in music and creative writing.
The creative writing program is run by the English Department, and offers courses in fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, and dramatic writing.

<h2>Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks</h2>
<p>The <strong>Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks</strong> or <strong>ASUAF</strong> is the representative group for the students attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
<p>During the fall and spring semesters, each student enrolled in three or more credit-hours pays a $35 fee to ASUAF, which lobbies the university administration and occasionally the state Legislature.
The government relations director is responsible for relations between ASUAF and local, state, and federal governments.
The director of <a>UAF Community and Technical College</a> relations coordinates ASUAF actions at CTC, while the recycling director coordinates the association's recycling program.
The senate appoints a senate chair at the beginning of the academic year.</p>
In 1995, a ballot box turned up a month after the election, uncounted, in police custody; a recount resulted in new senators being inducted, and then-President Joe Hayes nearly was impeached.</p>
<p>An electronic system was set-up for the fall 2002 elections, which officials at the time said would cut down on election problems.
At the time, officials said that since students could vote in the privacy of their rooms, it would be impossible to enforce <a>electioneering</a> claims.
<p>But in April 2004, incumbent President Thom Walker brought forward electioneering claims after his opponent, Brandon Maitlen, won the election by 43 votes.
Walker claimed Maitlen had bribed voters with hamburgers during an election day <a>barbecue</a> and had blared music and occasionally his voice too close to polls.
A new board was formed, but it did no good&#x2014;the board disqualified Maitlen, making Walker the winner.</p>
