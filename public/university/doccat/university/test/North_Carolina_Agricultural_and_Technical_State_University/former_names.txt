This college was established along with North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical College, now known as North Carolina State University; due to segregation laws, whites and blacks could not attend college together.
During this era, the marching band also was renamed to the current &#x201c;Blue &amp; Gold Marching Machine&#x201d; moniker.
