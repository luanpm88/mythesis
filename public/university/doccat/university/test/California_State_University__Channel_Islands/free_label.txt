Gaining official possession of the land in 1998 and then occupancy in 1999, California State University began classes on the  existing campus-style facility, primarily one to two-story buildings organized around three primary quads.
The campus is split into two primary sections: North Quad and South Quad.
Solano and Manzanita Halls are relatively new additions to the campus, adding classrooms for the nursing program and other various classes.
The  Student Union includes a large programmable area for student events and live entertainment; a dining center with a coffee shop, pizzeria, sandwich deli and salad bar; lounges for informal gatherings; a game room, pool tables and computer gaming systems; and ASI offices for Student Government, Student Programming Board, The Nautical Yearbook, and the Channel Islands View (CI View) student newspaper.
