<p>SwCC offers <a>associate's</a> and <a>bachelor's degree</a>s.
Many junior- and senior-level courses have been offered in recent years, which eventually lead to the school's first bachelor's degree graduates in 1984 and <a>online courses</a> at the present.
A concerted effort has been made by the <a>board of trustees</a> not to allow the college's somewhat-limited resources to be spread too thinly.</p>
<p>Southwestern's associate level graduates typically earn the <a>Associate of Arts</a> and <a>Associate of Science</a> degree; the bachelor level graduates typically earn the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>SwCC was founded in 1948 by the educator and minister G.P. Bowser.
SwCC became <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1973.
Alumni from the first years to the present can be found throughout the world in various walks of life from various countries and cultures.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1948, with some 45 students attending, a small beginning was made in Fort Worth, Texas, under the name of Southern Bible Institute.
<p>The Board intended to buy property in Fort Worth to erect a permanent school plant, but in the summer of 1949, an opportunity was afforded to purchase the school property formerly owned by the <a>Texas Military College</a> in Terrell.
When the military school closed and the property was offered for sale, the Trustees purchased it.
<p>On the campus stands the first dwelling erected in Terrell.
This home, built by a man named Terrell, was constructed in an octagonal shape to give better protection against Indians.
Today it remains as one of the twenty surviving Round Houses in the entire nation&#x2014;listed by the Dallas Centennial as a place to visit.
Even when it was built, the house was the object of interest as it contained the first glass windows in Kaufman County.
The doors, however, were typical of the pioneer houses in that they were put together with wooden pegs.
The original doors have long since been removed, and other rooms have been added at the back of the house, but the original logs used as supports in the house are still supporting the building.
The local chapter of the Historical Society has placed a historical marker at the Round House site.
<p>The administration building was built and used as a school fifty years ago.
It was then sold to Colonel Perry who operated it as a private military school.
After Colonel Perry's death, the school was continued by his wife, daughter, and son-in-law, and later by the people of Terrell.
<p>The Trustees of SwCC bought the property from the Perry estate in 1949 and began operation the following Fall.
The school became fully  accredited in 1973.
Southwestern Christian College is currently accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of  Colleges and Schools, to award Associate and Bachelor level degrees.
<p>Southwestern Christian College, founded and sponsored by members of Churches of Christ, is accredited as a four-year (level II), educational college (limited to Bachelor's degree in Bible and Religious Education), with a two-year associate program in the liberal arts.
Its purpose is to offer a holistic educational program that will motivate the student to value and achieve academic excellence within the context of commitment to moral and spiritual values; to assist students in making their transitions from high school to higher education on various levels; to assist students in preparation for varied vocations in life; to prepare future leaders for their distinct communities and the world at large.</p>
<p>In the founding and establishing of Southwestern Christian College, those who participated were motivated by a mutual desire to provide for its students' preparation for effective and successful Christian living.
Each was keenly sensitive to the urgency of this need.
To appreciate its importance, one must fully understand the concepts of &quot;Christian Living&quot;.
