<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daemen was founded in 1947 as <strong>Rosary Hill College</strong> for women by the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity, headed by Magdalene Daemen.
The school became <a>co-ed</a> in 1971, and changed its name in 1976 to honor its founder.
<p>Daemen College is unique for its Core Curriculum, which is competency-based.
Also notable is Daemen's integration of service learning into the Core Curriculum.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Daemen College sign and 2009 construction</a> :<em>The mission of Daemen College is to prepare students for life and leadership in an increasingly complex world.
Founded on the principle that education should elevate human dignity and foster civic responsibility and compassion, the college seeks to integrate the intellectual qualities acquired through study of the liberal arts with the education necessary for professional accomplishment.
<p>:<em>At the heart of Daemen's integrated learning experience is the relationship that can develop between the college's faculty and its students.
<p><strong>Gersh College</strong> is a <a>college</a> program established for students with <a>neurological disorders</a> who would have had difficulty in a public college.
The school will be located in the former George L. Lowry Middle School building and its accompanying  in <a>North Tonawanda, New York</a>.
The school will offer a two-year program for students with neurobiological disorders such as high functioning <a>autism</a>, <a>Tourette syndrome</a>, ADHD, OCD, and bipolar disorder.
The school is designed to educate the academically gifted who have neurobiological disorders.
The <a>middle school</a> was closed down after the 2003-2004 school year due to budget and claims that the building was not maintained properly.
The property was subsequently bought from the city by Gersh Management Services for a sum of $700,000 (this was the lowest of the three offered bids because it was the only offer that did not require tax deferment).
Gersh also owns another school in <a>New York State</a>, Gersh Academy, which provides the same support for younger children.
<p>Gersh College is expected to open no later than September 2007 and plans to open with a partnership with nearby Daemen College in <a>Amherst</a>.</p>
