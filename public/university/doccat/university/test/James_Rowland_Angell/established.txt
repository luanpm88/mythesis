<p> <strong>James Rowland Angell</strong> (May 8, 1869 &ndash; March 4, 1949) was an <a>American</a> <a>psychologist</a> and <a>educator</a>.
He served as the <a>president</a> of <a>Yale University</a> between 1921 and 1937.
His father, <a>James Burrill Angell</a> (1829&#x2013;1916), was president of the <a>University of Vermont</a> from 1866 to 1871 and then the <a>University of Michigan</a> from 1871 to 1909.</p>
<p>James Rowland Angell was born on May 8, 1869, in Burlington, Vermont.
He was born into one of the stellar academic families in American history.
His father, was the president of the <a>University of Vermont</a>.
He was the youngest of three children, with an older brother and sister.
When Angell was two years old, his family moved to Ann Arbor so that his father could take up the presidency of the <a>University of Michigan</a>.
His maternal grandfather, <a>Alexis Caswell</a>, was a professor of <a>Mathematics</a> and <a>Astronomy</a> at, and later president of, <a>Brown University</a>.
He was also  a charter member of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>.
His brother <a>Alexis Caswell Angell</a> became a professor of law of Michigan, and later a federal judge.
His sister's husband, <a>Andrew C. McLaughlin</a>, was head of  the history department at Michigan.
His cousin, <a>Frank Angell</a>, founded psychology laboratories at <a>Cornell</a> and <a>Stanford</a> Universities.
<p>Angell graduated from the <a>University of Michigan</a> with his Bachelor's Degree in 1890.
He worked closely with <a>John Dewey</a>, earning a Master's degree under his supervision in 1891.
At Michigan he was a member of <a>Delta Kappa Epsilon</a> fraternity (Omicron chapter).
He then went to <a>Harvard University</a> where he received a second Master's Degree in 1892 in <a>psychology</a>.
He studied for a doctorate in philosophy in Berlin and Halle.
His dissertation on the treatment of freedom in Kant was accepted, but required stylistic changes, which he never completed.
In 1895 he was offered position at the <a>University of Chicago</a> by <a>John Dewey</a>, who had moved from Michcgan the year before.
Almost immediately, he co-authored an article with his Chicago colleague <a>Addison W. Moore</a> that simultaneously settled a nasty dispute between <a>Cornell</a> psychologist <a>Edward Bradford Titchener</a> and <a>Princeton</a> psychologist <a>James Mark Baldwin</a> as well as laying the foundations for the school of <a>Functionalism</a>. Later, while still at Chicago, Angell published the textbook <em>Psychology; An Introductory Study of the Structure and Functions of Human Consciousness</em> in 1904, which became the major statement of the <a>functionalist approach</a> to psychology.
Angell noted that the goal of psychology was to study how the mind helps the organism adjust to the environment and <a>functionalism</a> was a method in which to study consciousness and how it improves the organism relationship with the environment.
In 1905 (the year after Dewey left Chicago for <a>Columbia University</a>), Angell became the head of the newly-created psychology department at Chicago.
During this time he served as the 15th and youngest president of the <a>American Psychological Association</a>.
He also supervised the young <a>John B. Watson</a>, who would later go on to found the behaviorist school of psychology.
In 1908, Angell was raised to the level of Dean at Chicago, leaving the psychology department to another of his former students, <a>Harvey Carr</a>.
During the last year of <a>World War I</a> Angell worked for the military under the supervision of <a>Northwestern University</a> psychologist <a>Walter Dill Scott</a>.
In 1920, he headed the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a>.
In 1921 Angell took up the presidency of <a>Yale University</a>, the first non-Yale graduate to do so since the early 18th century.
He remained president of <a>Yale University</a> his retirement in 1937, at which point he became educational counselor of the <a>National Broadcasting Company</a>.</p>
<p>In 1894, James married Marion Isabel Watrous from Des Moines, Iowa, a fellow graduate of the <a>University of Michigan</a>.
He had two children with her, one boy and one girl, but then she died in 1931.
James Angell died on March 4, 1949 in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
<p>He was greatly influenced by the thought of <a>John Dewey</a> and is closely identified with <a>functional psychology</a>.</p>
psychology is interested in mental operations by way of mental activity and its relation to the larger biological forces.
Angell believes that functional psychologists must consider the evolution of the mental operations in humans as one particular way to deal with the conditions of our environment.
processes aid in the cooperation between the needs of the organism and its environment.
Mental functions help the organism survive by aiding in the behavioral habits of the organism and unfamiliar situations.</p>
The total relationship of the organism and the environment and the minds function/place in this union is at question.
<p>By stating these points, Angell drew the difference between functionalism as a study to discover how mental processed operate, what they accomplish that has kept them around, and the conditions in which they occur or the how and why of consciousness and its predecessor, structuralism, which focused on individual mental elements or the what of consciousness.</p>
<p>James Angell did have some criticism come his way for his views.
The backlash from some about his implication of leaving out the <a>structuralism</a> model in studies and having a completely <a>functionalist</a> view did not sit well amongst some of his peers.
There was also the dissecting of his works and the assumption that he contradicted himself in his view of what consciousness was and its function.
Some think that he portrayed consciousness as more of a <a>deux ex machina</a> entity in its function due to his claim that the function of the conscious was to appear when the organism was in trouble and then disappear soon after the trouble had passes.</p>
