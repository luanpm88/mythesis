<h2>History</h2>

The genesis for a publicly funded institution of higher education in <a>Huntsville</a> was many years in the making.
Begun in January 1950 as an extension of the <a>University of Alabama</a> and known as the University of Alabama Huntsville Center, classes were first taught at West Huntsville <a>High School</a>.
UAH's first <a>undergraduate</a> degrees were awarded in May 1968 as part of the spring commencement ceremony at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, (although a &quot;cap and gown&quot; ceremony was held in Huntsville).</p>
<p>One year later, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees voted to make UAH an independent and autonomous campus.
Dr. Benjamin Graves, a graduate of the <a>University of Mississippi</a> in 1942, who was president of <a>Millsaps College</a> in <a>Jackson, Mississippi</a> was tapped as UAH's first president in 1970.
He returned to faculty status in 1979 and retired in 1989.The first degree awarded for work completed entirely on the UAH campus was awarded to Julian Palmore in 1964.
Mr. Palmore was at the time a <a>United States Navy</a> <a>ensign</a> assigned to <a>NASA</a>'s Research Projects Division.
The first official on-campus graduation ceremony at UAH was in June 1970.
The first woman to earn a <a>Ph.D.</a> from UAH was Virginia Kobler in 1979, in <a>Industrial Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>UAH's second president, Dr. John Wright was Vice <a>Chancellor</a> of the <a>West Virginia University</a> and began his service in 1979.
<p>Huntsville leader Joseph Moquin took over the UAH presidency on an interim basis in 1990.
Dr. Frank Franz, who was then <a>provost</a> at <a>West Virginia University</a>, was chosen as UAH's fourth president.
His wife, Dr. Judy Franz, accompanied him and was granted full professorship in the physics faculty.
Her renown in the scientific community was reaffirmed when she was named executive officer of the <a>American Physical Society</a> in 1994.
At the beginning of the 2006-2007 academic year, Frank Franz announced his plan to step down as president after that year.
On July 1, 2007, Dr. David B. Williams, formerly a professor of materials science and engineering and the vice <a>provost</a> for research at <a>Lehigh University</a>, began serving as UAH's fifth president.
Amy Bishop, a <a>Harvard University</a>-trained <a>neuroscientist</a>, was taken into custody.

UAH scientists managed the first &quot;commercial,&quot; non-government rocket programs (Consort and Joust) in the U.S., the first <a>&quot;high-temperature&quot; superconductor</a> was discovered at UAH and the first U.S. experiment flown aboard the Soviet Mir space station was from UAH. UAH is a <a>Space Grant</a> university, and has a history of cooperation with <a>NASA</a> at the <a>Marshall Space Flight Center</a>, and the <a>U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command</a> at <a>Redstone Arsenal</a>.
The <a>National Space Science and Technology Center</a> is on the UAH campus.</p>
The PRC was founded by Dr. Clark W. Hawk in 1991 and has since provided support for NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy.
<p>Research in nanotechnology and microfabrication is administered by the <a>Nano and Micro Devices Center</a>.</p>
<p>At least eight departments or programs also hold accreditation from professional associations, including the <a>Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a>, the <a>American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business</a>, the <a>American Chemical Society</a>, the <a>Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education</a>, the <a>Computing Sciences Accreditation Board</a>, and the <a>National Association of Schools of Music</a>.</p>

<p>The SSC recruits university students for its PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) program, in which students sit in on courses that they have already succeeded in, and offer class-specific study sessions outside of class, usually 3 hours per week.
<p>UAH offers numerous cooperative education opportunities for its students, many of which lead to post-graduation employment.</p>
