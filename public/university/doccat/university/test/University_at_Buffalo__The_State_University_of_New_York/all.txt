established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Initial years</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Buffalo was founded in May 1846 as a private medical school to train the doctors for the communities of <a>Buffalo</a>, <a>Niagara Falls</a>, and surrounding villages.
established$$$@@@%%%James Platt White was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the University of Buffalo from the state legislature in 1846.
established$$$@@@%%%He also taught the first class of 89 men in obstetrics.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The doors first opened to students in 1847 and after associating with a hospital for teaching purposes, the first class of students graduated the medical school in July 1847.
head_label$$$@@@%%%The first chancellor of the University was future President of the United States <a>Millard Fillmore</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Upon his ascension to the presidency after President Taylor's death, Fillmore stayed on as part-time chancellor.
established$$$@@@%%%Fillmore's name now graces the continuing education school Millard Fillmore College located on the South Campus as well as the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, an academic and administrative services building at the core of the residential Joseph Ellicott Complex, located on the North Campus.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early development</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After many expansions to the college medical programs, including the addition of a pharmacy division, UB acquired the Buffalo Law School from <a>Niagara University</a> in 1891 and formed the <a>University of Buffalo Law School</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1909 the University acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the first buildings on what would later become UB's initial comprehensive campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Although the South Campus (also called the &quot;Main Street&quot; campus) is often referred to as the &quot;original campus&quot;, the South (Main Street) Campus is not actually the University's oldest property.
established$$$@@@%%%UB was originally housed in a leased building, the First Baptist Church, which had also served as a post office from 1836-1846.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the College of Arts and Sciences, formally departing from its tradition of teaching only for licensed professional fields.
website$$$@@@%%%During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 1998-1999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1950, the <a>Industrial Engineering</a> department branched off from the <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> department.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1956, a <a>Civil Engineering</a> Department was formed under <a>Lehigh University</a> graduate <a>Robert L. Ketter</a>, who went on to become Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1959, <a>WBFO</a> was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students.
established$$$@@@%%%The station has since become the launching pad of two modern <a>National Public Radio</a> personalities: <a>Terri Gross</a> and <a>Ira Flatow</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 1960s, the private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the SUNY system, and became known as the University <em>at</em> Buffalo or SUNY at Buffalo.</p>

country$$$@@@%%%[[nuclear reactor]] on the South Campus]] In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This little known program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus.
established$$$@@@%%%This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with government-run research labs operated by rival <a>UC Berkeley</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception.
former_names$$$@@@%%%This reactor was formally decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1964, UB acquired property in the northern town of <a>Amherst</a> for future development of a second campus catering to most non-medical disciplines at UB.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This would later become the North Campus, and the center of most non-medical UB activity.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>UB 2020</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Started in 2004 under President John B. Simpson, UB 2020 is a massive strategic planning initiative to develop and implement a vision for the university over the next 15 years.
established$$$@@@%%%The centerpiece of UB 2020 is to add about 10,000 more students, 750 faculty members and 600 staff, increasing the size of the University by about 40 percent.
mascot$$$@@@%%%UB 2020 also recognizes the university's contribution to the surrounding region.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The most recent estimates of UB's impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.50 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB, whose annual budget is currently $96 million.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Both of these figures are also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB&#x2019;s institutional growth.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The five major principles that guide UB 2020 are promoting academic excellence (e.g.: the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and the development of vital intellectual communities); promoting a united and accessible university campus that features three strong, distinctive and seamlessly interconnected centers and facilitates social interaction; reflecting the university&#x2019;s responsibility to the community by respecting public plans and policies; providing the basis for long-range capital programming and stewardship of university resources; and establishing UB as a leader in environmental stewardship and sustainable development.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The four main components of UB 2020 are &quot;Excelling in Academics,&quot; &quot;Strategic Strengths,&quot; &quot;Building UB: The Comprehensive Physical Plan,&quot; and &quot;Achieving Growth&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>One of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan is the passage of S2020 and A2020 by the New York State Legislature.
established$$$@@@%%%The bill is known as the UB 2020 flexibility and economic growth act.
established$$$@@@%%%On June 3, 2009 the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Comprehensive Physical Plan</h4>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>The University at Buffalo has accumulated 27,700 undergraduate and <a>graduate students</a>, as well as 14,000 employees, across three campuses in the last 160 years.
established$$$@@@%%%In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The firm granted the contract to lead the project is <a>Beyer Blinder Belle</a>.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>The comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases.
established$$$@@@%%%Currently, UB is implementing &quot;phase one&quot; by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion.
established$$$@@@%%%The project recognizes UB&#x2019;s potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.</p>
