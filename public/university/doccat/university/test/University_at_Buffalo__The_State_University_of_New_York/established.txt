Offering 84 <a>bachelor's</a>, 184 <a>master's</a> and 78 <a>doctoral</a> degrees, it is a flagship campus  and the largest of the four comprehensive university centers within the <a>State University of New York</a> (SUNY) system.
From its inception in 1846 until 1962, the private school was known as the <strong>University of Buffalo</strong>.
Once it became a state university, the name was changed, but many alumni still refer to it by the former name.</p>
<p>According to the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>, the University at Buffalo is a Research University with Very High Research Activity (RU/VH).
The University houses the largest state-operated <a>medical school</a> and features the only state <a>law school</a>, <a>architecture</a> and <a>urban planning</a> school, and <a>pharmacy</a> school in the state of New York.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Buffalo was founded in May 1846 as a private medical school to train the doctors for the communities of <a>Buffalo</a>, <a>Niagara Falls</a>, and surrounding villages.
James Platt White was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the University of Buffalo from the state legislature in 1846.
He also taught the first class of 89 men in obstetrics.</p>
<p>The doors first opened to students in 1847 and after associating with a hospital for teaching purposes, the first class of students graduated the medical school in July 1847.
Upon his ascension to the presidency after President Taylor's death, Fillmore stayed on as part-time chancellor.
Fillmore's name now graces the continuing education school Millard Fillmore College located on the South Campus as well as the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, an academic and administrative services building at the core of the residential Joseph Ellicott Complex, located on the North Campus.</p>
<p>After many expansions to the college medical programs, including the addition of a pharmacy division, UB acquired the Buffalo Law School from <a>Niagara University</a> in 1891 and formed the <a>University of Buffalo Law School</a>.</p>
<p>In 1909 the University acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the first buildings on what would later become UB's initial comprehensive campus.
Although the South Campus (also called the &quot;Main Street&quot; campus) is often referred to as the &quot;original campus&quot;, the South (Main Street) Campus is not actually the University's oldest property.
UB was originally housed in a leased building, the First Baptist Church, which had also served as a post office from 1836-1846.</p>
<p>In 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the College of Arts and Sciences, formally departing from its tradition of teaching only for licensed professional fields.
During the 1998-1999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1950, the <a>Industrial Engineering</a> department branched off from the <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> department.
In 1956, a <a>Civil Engineering</a> Department was formed under <a>Lehigh University</a> graduate <a>Robert L. Ketter</a>, who went on to become Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University.</p>
<p>In 1959, <a>WBFO</a> was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students.
The station has since become the launching pad of two modern <a>National Public Radio</a> personalities: <a>Terri Gross</a> and <a>Ira Flatow</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, the private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the SUNY system, and became known as the University <em>at</em> Buffalo or SUNY at Buffalo.</p>
This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with government-run research labs operated by rival <a>UC Berkeley</a>.
Consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception.
<p>In 1964, UB acquired property in the northern town of <a>Amherst</a> for future development of a second campus catering to most non-medical disciplines at UB.
<p>Started in 2004 under President John B. Simpson, UB 2020 is a massive strategic planning initiative to develop and implement a vision for the university over the next 15 years.
The centerpiece of UB 2020 is to add about 10,000 more students, 750 faculty members and 600 staff, increasing the size of the University by about 40 percent.
<p>The five major principles that guide UB 2020 are promoting academic excellence (e.g.: the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and the development of vital intellectual communities); promoting a united and accessible university campus that features three strong, distinctive and seamlessly interconnected centers and facilitates social interaction; reflecting the university&#x2019;s responsibility to the community by respecting public plans and policies; providing the basis for long-range capital programming and stewardship of university resources; and establishing UB as a leader in environmental stewardship and sustainable development.</p>
<p>One of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan is the passage of S2020 and A2020 by the New York State Legislature.
The bill is known as the UB 2020 flexibility and economic growth act.
On June 3, 2009 the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.</p>
In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities.
Currently, UB is implementing &quot;phase one&quot; by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion.
The project recognizes UB&#x2019;s potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.</p>
The Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card awarded the university a B-.</p>
<p>Construction of this campus began in the 1970s.
Many academic programs, including the entirety of the College of Arts and Sciences, the <a>University at Buffalo Law School</a>, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Management, the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the Graduate School of Education, as well as <a>Lockwood Memorial Library</a>, Capen Library, and many administrative offices, are located on UB's North Campus in <a>Amherst, NY</a>.</p>
The college was designed by architect E.B. Green in 1910, and was intended to resemble <a>Trinity College, Dublin</a>.
The South Campus, also the initial campus, is located on  in northeastern Buffalo.
Its 53 buildings contain () and include six resident halls.
as well as the <a>Roswell Park Cancer Institute</a> and <a>Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute</a> to compose the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.
