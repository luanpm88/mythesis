established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> <strong>Dhaka Survey School</strong> was established in 1876 as a <a>survey</a> <a>school</a> for training <a>surveyor</a>s.
established$$$@@@%%%at Nalgola, in Old Dhaka to train surveyors for the then <a>Government</a> of <a>Bengal</a> of <a>British India</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Later, generous grants from <a>Nawab Ahsanullah</a>, a renowned <a>Muslim</a> patron of Education and member of the <a>Nawab family of Dhaka</a> enabled it to expand as a full fledged <a>engineering</a> school.
established$$$@@@%%%<em>Ahsanullah School of Engineering</em> offered three-year <a>diploma</a> courses in <a>Civil Engineering</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a> and <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In recognition of the generous financial contribution from the then <a>Nawab of Dhaka</a>, it was named after his father <a>Khwaja Ahsanullah</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was moved to its present premises in 1912.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After the <a>partition of India</a> in 1947, it was upgraded to <em>Ahsanullah Engineering College</em>, as a <a>Faculty</a> of <a>Engineering</a> under the <a>University of Dhaka</a>, offering four-year <a>bachelor's</a> courses in <a>Civil</a>, <a>Electrical</a>, <a>Mechanical</a>, <a>Chemical</a> and <a>Metallurgical Engineering</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1962, it was renamed as <em>East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology</em> (EPUET).
established$$$@@@%%%A partnership with the <em>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</em> (renamed <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a> in 1963) was forged, and professors from A&amp;M came to teach and to formulate the curriculum.
nickname$$$@@@%%%During this period, EPUET offered courses in Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Chemical engineering, and Architecture.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After the <a>liberation war</a> of 1971, <a>Bangladesh</a> became independent, and <em>EPUET</em> was renamed to <em>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</em>.</p>
undergrad$$$@@@%%%<p>Several more departments to offer graduate and undergraduate courses in different subjects like:Naval Architecture &amp; Marine Engineering, Industrial &amp; Production Engineering, Petroleum &amp; Mineral Resources Engineering, Computer Science &amp; Engineering were included in the university at different times.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2007, BUET celebrated 60 years of engineering education in Bangladesh by arranging a series of programs and events.</p>
