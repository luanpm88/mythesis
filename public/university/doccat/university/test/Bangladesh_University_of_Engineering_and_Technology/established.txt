It is the oldest Engineering institution in the region, and is regarded as one of the top universities for technical education in Bangladesh.
The University has continued to expand over the last three <a>decade</a>s.
<h2>History</h2>
<p> <strong>Dhaka Survey School</strong> was established in 1876 as a <a>survey</a> <a>school</a> for training <a>surveyor</a>s.
at Nalgola, in Old Dhaka to train surveyors for the then <a>Government</a> of <a>Bengal</a> of <a>British India</a>.
Later, generous grants from <a>Nawab Ahsanullah</a>, a renowned <a>Muslim</a> patron of Education and member of the <a>Nawab family of Dhaka</a> enabled it to expand as a full fledged <a>engineering</a> school.
<em>Ahsanullah School of Engineering</em> offered three-year <a>diploma</a> courses in <a>Civil Engineering</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a> and <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>.
In recognition of the generous financial contribution from the then <a>Nawab of Dhaka</a>, it was named after his father <a>Khwaja Ahsanullah</a>.
It was moved to its present premises in 1912.</p>
<p>After the <a>partition of India</a> in 1947, it was upgraded to <em>Ahsanullah Engineering College</em>, as a <a>Faculty</a> of <a>Engineering</a> under the <a>University of Dhaka</a>, offering four-year <a>bachelor's</a> courses in <a>Civil</a>, <a>Electrical</a>, <a>Mechanical</a>, <a>Chemical</a> and <a>Metallurgical Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In 1962, it was renamed as <em>East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology</em> (EPUET).
A partnership with the <em>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</em> (renamed <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a> in 1963) was forged, and professors from A&amp;M came to teach and to formulate the curriculum.
<p>After the <a>liberation war</a> of 1971, <a>Bangladesh</a> became independent, and <em>EPUET</em> was renamed to <em>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</em>.</p>
<p>In 2007, BUET celebrated 60 years of engineering education in Bangladesh by arranging a series of programs and events.</p>
M.A. Rashid Building</a> The BUET campus is in the <a>capital</a> city of Dhaka.
It has a modest-size campus with limited capacity for residence within walking distances of the academic buildings.
The academic area is confined in and around the old campus occupying 30.24 <a>acre</a>s (122,000 m&#x00b2;) of land defined by Shahid Sharani, Bakshi Bazar road and the <a>Asian Highway</a>.
This area accommodates five faculties, three institutes, the administrative building, the central <a>library</a>, main <a>sports</a> facilities, the <a>auditorium</a> complex, the BUET Club and eighty two small units of residential accommodation of <a>teacher</a>s, staff and employees and the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>'s quarter.</p>

<p>BUET central library has a great compilation of books, journals, periodicals and monographs of the relevant engineering fields.
Central library has a collection of over 132,000 volumes and 218 current periodical subscription.
Per year 1500 volume is added in this library.
It has also a free internet browsing facility and rental library program.
<p>Undergraduate admission test is one of the intensive written examination in Bangladesh as it only offers a limited number of seats in each academic year.
The screening process allows 6000 students to sit for the admission test from a pool of approximately 40,000 applicants.

<h3>Halls of residence</h3>
The <em>Shahid Smriti Hall</em> is reserved for young <a>teacher</a>s who do not have an official quarter in the campus and for the graduate students.
These halls were built in different periods of time.
Designs of these halls bear the history and architecture of different time.
Administrative head of a residence hall is its <a>provost</a>, usually chosen from the senior <a>teacher</a>s of different faculties.
Most of the halls are named after several eminent figures in the history of Bangladesh.
