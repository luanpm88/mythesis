<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left</a> In 1862 American missionaries in Lebanon and Syria, under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, asked Dr. Daniel Bliss to establish a college of higher learning that would include medical training.
On April 24, 1863, while Dr. Daniel Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College.
The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened with a class of 16 students on December 3, 1866.
For example, 19 AUB alumni were delegates to the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 &#x2014; more than any other university in the world.
