The PTC traces back its existence to 1866 when &quot;The Theological Hall of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria&quot; was formed.
In 1974, however, the whole staff of the Theological Hall opted to join with the <a>Uniting Church</a>, and the continuing Presbyterian Church of Victoria opened a provisional Theological Hall in Hawthorn with only a handful of staff and students.
It relocated to the top floor of the Assembly Hall building in Melbourne in 1977, and again to the present site in Box Hill in 1986.
Six residential units were opened on the college property in early 2008.</p>
<p>The first Principal of the newly-formed College was Rev Robert Swanton.
He was succeeded by Rev Prof <a>Allan Harman</a> in 1982, who served until his retirement in 2001.
<p>The student group at the college is called the John Paton Fellowship, named after <a>John Gibson Paton</a>, a nineteenth-century missionary to the <a>New Hebrides</a>.
The college has a library of 19,000 volumes.</p>
