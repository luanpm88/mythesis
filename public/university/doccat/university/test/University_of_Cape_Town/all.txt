established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|250px|University of Cape Town's  Groote Schuur campus in 1930</a> The roots of UCT lie in the establishment of the <a>South African College</a>, a boys' school, in 1829.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1874 the tertiary education part split off into the University and the younger students into the <a>South African College Schools</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>UCT moved to the <a>Groote Schuur</a> Estate campus in 1928.
established$$$@@@%%%During the <a>apartheid</a> era, roughly 1960-1990, UCT consistently opposed apartheid, and was a bastion of liberalism and racial integration.
established$$$@@@%%%1987 particularly saw frequent clashes between protesting students and police, with reporting of police presence on the campus being censored by the government.
established$$$@@@%%%On 24 April 1987 the police entered the campus and this marked the first time since 1972 that South Africa's police services had suppressed a demonstration at a white university.
