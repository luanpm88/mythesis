<p>  The <strong>University of Cape Town</strong> (<strong>UCT</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Cape Town</a> in the <a>Western Cape</a> province of South Africa.
UCT was founded in 1829 as the <a>South African College</a>, and is the oldest university in South Africa.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|University of Cape Town's  Groote Schuur campus in 1930</a> The roots of UCT lie in the establishment of the <a>South African College</a>, a boys' school, in 1829.
In 1874 the tertiary education part split off into the University and the younger students into the <a>South African College Schools</a>.</p>
<p>UCT moved to the <a>Groote Schuur</a> Estate campus in 1928.
During the <a>apartheid</a> era, roughly 1960-1990, UCT consistently opposed apartheid, and was a bastion of liberalism and racial integration.
1987 particularly saw frequent clashes between protesting students and police, with reporting of police presence on the campus being censored by the government.
On 24 April 1987 the police entered the campus and this marked the first time since 1972 that South Africa's police services had suppressed a demonstration at a white university.
<p>The UCT crest was designed in 1859 by <a>Charles Davidson Bell</a>, Surveyor-General of the Cape Colony at the time.
Bell was an accomplished artist who also designed medals and the triangular Cape stamp.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|A view of UCT</a> The main teaching campus, known as the Upper Campus, is located on the <a>Rhodes</a> Estate on the slopes of <a>Devil's Peak</a>.
This campus contains, in a relatively compact site, the faculties of <a>Science</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Commerce</a>, and <a>Humanities</a> (except for the arts departments), as well as <a>Smuts Hall</a> and Fuller Hall <a>residences</a>.
The original buildings and layout of Upper Campus were designed by <a>JM Solomon</a> and built between 1928 and 1930.
Upper Campus is also home to the main library, The Chancellor Oppenheimer library which holds the majority of the University's 1.3 million volume collection.</p>
These campuses, which are spread through the suburbs of <a>Rondebosch</a>, <a>Rosebank</a> and <a>Mowbray</a>, contain the <a>Law</a> faculty, the <a>South African College of Music</a>, most of the student residences, most of the university administrative offices, and various sporting facilities.
The state of the art artificial grass <a>soccer</a> field has been approved by FIFA for training for <a>World Cup</a> teams.
<p>The Faculty of <a>Health Sciences</a> is located on the <a>Medical School</a> campus next to the <a>Groote Schuur Hospital</a> in <a>Observatory</a>.
The University's original building, now known as the <em>Egyptian Building</em>, on the Hiddingh campus, was built in the <a>Egyptian Revival</a> style.
The only other campus built in this style was the <a>Medical College of Virginia</a> in <a>Richmond, Virginia</a> in the United States.
The <a>UCT Graduate School of Business</a> is located on the <a>Breakwater Lodge</a> Campus at the <a>Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront</a>.
<p><a>thumb|Jameson Hall and Jammie Plaza, the focal point of the upper campus</a> The organisation of the University is defined in the Statute of the University of Cape Town, in accordance with the <em><a>Higher Education Act, 1997</a></em>.
Before 2002, it was defined by a <a>private Act of Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>The titular head of the University is the <a>Chancellor</a>; this is a ceremonial position without executive power.
The primary role of the Chancellor is to confer degrees on behalf of the University, and to represent the University to the rest of the world.
The current Chancellor is Ms <a>Gra&#x00e7;a Machel</a>, elected for her first 10-year term in September 1999 and re-electect in May 2010.</p>
The VC has the overall responsibility for the policy and administration of the University.
The VC is assisted in his task by a number of <a>Deputy Vice-Chancellor</a>s (DVCs) who handle specific portfolios.
The <a>Registrar</a> is responsible for the academic administration of the University, as well as legal matters, and is secretary to the University Council and Senate.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|The Kramer Building, home of the Law Faculty</a> The academic departments of UCT are divided into six faculties: <a>Commerce</a>, <a>Engineering</a> and the <a>Built Environment</a>, <a>Health Sciences</a>, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Law</a>, and <a>Science</a>; each faculty is led by a Dean.
The multidisciplinary Center for Higher Education Development rates on a level equal to the faculties.
Although the Graduate School of Business is considered to be part of the Faculty of <a>Commerce</a>, it is run independently and has its own Dean and Director.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Tugwell and Marquard residence halls</a> , 23,500 students were enrolled, of which 6,700 (28,5%) were <a>postgraduate</a> students.
The ratio between male and female students is almost exactly 50:50.
The &quot;Ikey&quot; nickname originated in the 1910s as an <a>anti-semitic</a> epithet applied to UCT students by the students of <a>Stellenbosch University</a>, because of the supposed large number of Jewish students at UCT. Stellenbosch is UCT's traditional rugby opponent; an annual &quot;Intervarsity&quot; match is played between  the two universities.</p>
Some of the biggest include: <a>SHAWCO</a>, Ubunye and RAG.</p>
