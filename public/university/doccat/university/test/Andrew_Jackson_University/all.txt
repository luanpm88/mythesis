president$$$@@@%%%<p>In July 2008, Andrew Jackson University introduced a sponsored tuition program that eliminates tuition, the major component of costs borne by students.
established$$$@@@%%%The program has generated a tremendous amount of interest from the education industry and students.
country$$$@@@%%%AJU President Don Kassner explained Andrew Jackson University&#x2019;s zero tuition program by saying, &#x201c;Most universities spend a tremendous amount of money to recruit students.
established$$$@@@%%%Many spend as much as thirty-five percent of their revenue on marketing and advertising.
president$$$@@@%%%They have to keep their tuition high to recover these costs.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%We eliminated these costs by structuring relationships with strategic partners that refer potential students to us.
staff$$$@@@%%%Therefore, we can operate a quality, degree granting institution without the escalating tuition and excessive fees deemed necessary by many schools.&#x201d;
