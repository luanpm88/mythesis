<p>  [[Image:Hinkle panorama inside.JPG|600px|thumb|center|An interior panorama of Butler University's [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]], constructed in 1928, during a game between the Bulldogs and the <a>University of Wisconsin Green Bay</a>.]]</p>
When the school moved to its current Fairview campus location, two of the first structures completed were a 15,000-seat fieldhouse and a 36,000-seat football stadium.
The stadium was downsized to a 20,000-seat stadium in the mid-1950s, and later seating dropped to below 6,000.
Recent changes to the Butler Bowl and its landscape have included removal of the Hilton U. Brown Theatre in 2004, installation of a synthetic turf playing surface in fall 2005 and the addition of the Apartment Village on the east side of the complex in 2006.
The renovation of the facility will increase the seating capacity to 5,647 with the addition of new bleacher seats along the west side of the field and a section of seating for visiting fans on the east side.
<p>The fieldhouse, which was the largest of its kind when it was completed in 1928, is a historical landmark.
The Butler Fieldhouse, which was renamed <a>Hinkle Fieldhouse</a> in 1966, came to symbolize not only Butler athletics, but also Indiana &quot;Hoosier Hysteria.&quot;
