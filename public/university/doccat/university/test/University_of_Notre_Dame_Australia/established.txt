<p>The <strong>University of Notre Dame Australia (UNDA)</strong> is a private <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>university</a> established in 1989 in the <a>Western Australia</a>n port city of <a>Fremantle</a>, .
A large number of students from the American Notre Dame participate in a study abroad program at the Fremantle campus.
<p>The University has campuses in <a>Fremantle, Western Australia</a>, <a>Broome, Western Australia</a> and <a>Sydney</a>, <a>New South Wales</a>.</p>
In percentage growth terms, however, it is one of Australia's fastest growing universities, with an increase in student load of more than 13% in 2008 compared with 2007.
<p>In 2006, Notre Dame Australia established its first campus in Sydney in the suburb of <a>Chippendale</a> close to the CBD.
The small campus occupies part of the complex of St Benedict's Church, with which it retains close ties.
There are over 2200 students enrolled in Arts, Business, Law and Nursing courses.In 2008 the first cohort of students commenced at the newly-built medical school at the <a>Darlinghurst</a> Campus.
The clinical schools for the Darlinghurst campus include <a>St Vincent's Hospital</a>, which is immediately across the road.
<p>In line with the Commonwealth Government's priorities for higher education, in 2009 Notre Dame signed an interim agreement for Mission based compacts with the Commonwealth, outlining its goals as well as its vision for a unique place in Australian higher education.</p>
Professor Hammond is a qualified lawyer and was previously the Head of the University's Fremantle School of Law.</p>
She stated in her inauguration speech that knowledge and learning must be within a framework of humanity in order to ensure that students have love and respect for the world; not just wisdom.
Our mission will always be to teach and to educate in an environment that encourages people to seek understanding, to seek wisdom, to seek to serve, to seek to live in a way that fulfils everyone&#x2019;s higher purpose.&quot;</p>

The last audit was conducted in 2008 and it resulted in a number of commendations and recommendations.
<li>AUQA commends Notre Dame on the multifaceted admissions process that places importance on the fit between the student and the institution.</li>
<p>&quot;Notre Dame managers and staff emphasise that during the years of establishing Notre Dame as a private university in Australia, most of the effort went into developing and enhancing teaching and learning and the pastoral care of students.
<p>Although not specifically mentioned in the AUQA report, the University's financial position and its lack of resources to fund critical infrastructure such as libraries, IT and research support was of concern.
In 2008, Notre Dame made an operating loss of $2.4m on revenues of $70m, and had loans and liabilities of more than $130m.</p>
<p>It also faces a new challenge in the form of union intervention in its activities, with the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) logging claims for staff entitlements for the first time in 2009.

<p>The libraries were included in the 2008 AUQA audit mentioned above and resulted in an urgent affirmation:</p>
