The Alumni House (Drengaelen), The President's House, The Dean's &amp; President's Offices (David &amp; May Coker House) and The Registrar's Offices (Lawton-Wilson House) are all located in old mansions along the northern edge of campus.</p>
<p>The residence halls are protected by locking rooms, ID card swipe building entry and 24-hour security guards that patrol the campus.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the main campus is a  athletics complex with baseball, softball, soccer and tennis facilities.
Near the athletics fields on East Carolina Avenue are the Saleeby House, home to Coker's athletics program, and the Department of Education Building.
<p>The college has 12 varsity athletics programs which compete in <a>Conference Carolinas</a>.

<p>Because of the enormous wealth that Sonoco and other industries have brought to the town, there are many businesses that one would not normally find in a town of this size.
The Sory Boathouse is equipped with several canoes, tandem kayaks and associated equipment.
Kalmia Gardens hosts numerous community events and contains biking and walking trails that are open to the public.</p>
