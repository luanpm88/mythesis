The college also offers individual majors and double majors; self-designated degree programs; specializations; and pre-professional programs.
<p>Instituted in 1985, Coker&#x2019;s unique, interactive &quot;<a>Round Table</a>&quot; teaching style is recognized as a model learning experience in <a>Smart Parents Guide to College</a> (&#x00a9; Peterson&#x2019;s, 1997) for promoting the discussion of ideas while building leadership and communication skills.</p>
<p>Coker offers summer programs for high school students in partnership with <a>Blueprint Summer Programs</a>.
<p>The Center creates, implements and evaluates models for partnerships between higher education, community organizations, local, state and national government entities and funding agencies.
<p>Coker encourages students to study abroad through its <a>Center for International and Experiential Education</a> (CIEE).
Coker views international experience as an essential part of any liberal arts education and has established relationships with partner schools to facilitate students' desires to study abroad.
The Susan Coker Watson Scholarship awards money to rising juniors and seniors hoping to study in a European nation, while the Malcolm Doubles Scholarship awards funds to study anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Coker utilizes a distinctive four-year program that emphasizes a practical application of the liberal arts as well as hands-on and discussion-based learning within and beyond the class room.
<p>Since the inauguration of <a>Dr.
Robert L. Wyatt</a> as Coker College's 16th president on July 1, 2009, the college has been putting forth efforts to &quot;[Re]define Ready.&quot;
<p>&quot;Preparing our students for the world as it was, or even as it is, does them a serious disservice,&quot; said Dr. Wyatt during his inauguration speech.
<p><a><strong>The [Re]defining Ready Top Ten List:</strong></a></p>
We must redefine what we mean when we say, &quot;A Coker student leads by example.&quot;</li>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Coker College began in 1894 as Welsh Neck High School, founded by a local businessman and <a>American Civil War</a> veteran, <a>Major James Lide Coker</a> (1837&#x2013;1918).
In 1908, when <a>South Carolina</a> created a statewide public school system, Major Coker led the effort to convert the school to Coker College for Women.
<p>From the 1920s until just after <a>World War II</a>, it was the only college between <a>Columbia</a> and <a>Charleston</a> accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
<p>Coker was once affiliated with the <a>South Carolina Baptist Convention</a>, but has been non-denominational since 1944.
It officially became co-ed in 1969, although men had been attending since the end of <a>World War II</a>.</p>
<p>From 1988 to 2003, Coker students often interacted with students from <a>South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics</a> (SCGSSM) who lived and took their own courses on campus.
In 2003, the SCGSSM moved to its own campus a few blocks away.</p>
<p>The <a>Financial Aid Office</a> is dedicated to helping each family navigate the financial planning process.</p>
<p>Coker awards more than $5.7 million annually in scholarships and grants in addition to federal and state aid.</p>
<p>The <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> has given Coker special commendations for the quality of interaction between faculty, students and staff and the attractiveness of the campus grounds and facilities.</p>
<p><em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> selected Coker College a &#x201c;Best Southeastern College&#x201d; in its 2011 rankings based on academic excellence and student satisfaction; this is Coker's seventh consecutive selection to this honor.
<p>Barron&#x2019;s consistently names Coker one of the nation's 300 Best Buys in College Education.</p>
<p>The <a>National Survey of Student Engagement</a> ranked Coker in the top 10% of all institutions for providing students with a supportive campus environment, enriching educational experiences, student-faculty interaction, active and collaborative learning and a high level of academic challenge.</p>
<p>Hartsville and Coker College owe much to the generosity of the Coker family, founders of <a>Sonoco</a> and Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company.
The Coker family's patronage of the college has led the vast majority of buildings on campus having Coker somewhere in the name.
Students often joke to freshmen or visitors that they'll meet them &quot;in the Coker&quot; building as a way to gently initiate newcomers to campus.</p>
<a>Richard and Tuck Coker Hall</a> (1988), commonly called the RTC, lies between the library and the other residence halls.
The Dining Hall offers three meals a day that range from light healthy fare to hearty &quot;homecooking.&quot;
<p>In the Coker Residence Hall's basement one finds The Cobra Den and The Cobra Pit &#x2014; the on-campus spot for night life.
Open nightly, The Pit offers students the luxury of playing pool or watching television without having to leave the residence halls.
The Cobra Den serves as the venue for the faculty Academic Karaoke lectures, and on the weekend, The Den has resident DJs.</p>
<p>In January 2008, students began using the <a>Charles W. and Joan S. Coker Library-Information Technology Center</a>.
This  state-of-the-art building replaces the James Lide Coker III Library, which will be remodeled into an upscale residence hall.
The new library was built entirely from donations from a capital campaign and is an example of Coker alumni generosity to the college.</p>
<p><a>Coker Student Health Services</a> is housed in the residence halls, near the Dining Hall.
An RN is on-site to aid with general injuries and treatments and to make referrals to physicians as needed.</p>

<p>Traditions of the college include: ;Bonfire and Homecoming Court Held in early October, Homecoming Week consists of a formal welcoming of the alumni, a homecoming soccer game and a competition between classes.
Some of the competition activities include class cheers, class comedian competitions and the Hunk Contest.
A bonfire is always held (drought-permitting) as a capstone event.</p>
<p>;Winter Formal A recent addition to campus traditions, the Winter Formal dance is held at the Hartsville Country Club.</p>
Competition is arranged by class (school year), and the winner earns the highly-coveted title of C.O.W. Days Champions.</p>
<p>;Crew Race Each Spring at the Sory Boathouse on Prestwood Lake (just blocks from Coker's campus), teams made up of sister classes race across the lake in canoes.
Teams practice for weeks ahead of time to continue a tradition that dates back to 1919.</p>
<a>Aramark</a> Corporation donates the food, and the college's employees provide the free labor.
<p>;Coffee at the Courtyard During Fall and Spring semesters, in front of Davidson Hall at 9:15 AM every Thursday morning, Coker provides students, staff and faculty with free <a>coffee</a>, <a>hot chocolate</a>, juice and pastries.
A brief ceremony is usually held to honor people's recent accomplishments, but the main benefit is a chance to chat and socialize with people outside one's normal sphere.
The Evening School has a similar program, but it only happens once a semester.</p>
<p>;BandFest One of the students' favorite events is BandFest, a concert festival consisting of bands invited from around the country.
<p>Coker College founded, and still co-hosts, the annual and free Jazz!
<p>The fourth weekend of every March, the <a>RenoFest</a> comes to Hartsville with excellent bluegrass music from a wide variety of bands from around the country.
Also, Coker students help invigorate the downtown economy, attracting businesses that lend it a young and vibrant atmosphere.
<p>Through generous donations, Coker also owns the Sory Boathouse on Prestwood Lake and the <a>Kalmia Gardens</a> of Coker College.
Students can borrow the key and enjoy all South Carolina <a>blackwater</a> has to offer, free of charge.
It is home to the Hart House (built in 1820) and adjoins the  Segars-McKinnon Heritage Preserve, a blackwater swamp and forested wildlife reservation.
The two properties comprise , roughly equal in size to <a>New York City</a>'s <a>Central Park</a>.
<p>Along the campus's eastern edge, through the cooperation of several entities, the City of <a>Hartsville</a> will build the Vista Railyard Project.
It will be filled with greenspace, a park and <a>municipal</a> buildings.
The project will connect Coker College and the Governor&#x2019;s School for Science and Math to downtown Hartsville and provide an educational <a>corridor</a> when completed.</p>
