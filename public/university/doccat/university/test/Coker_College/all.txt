established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Coker College began in 1894 as Welsh Neck High School, founded by a local businessman and <a>American Civil War</a> veteran, <a>Major James Lide Coker</a> (1837&#x2013;1918).
established$$$@@@%%%In 1908, when <a>South Carolina</a> created a statewide public school system, Major Coker led the effort to convert the school to Coker College for Women.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From the 1920s until just after <a>World War II</a>, it was the only college between <a>Columbia</a> and <a>Charleston</a> accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Coker was once affiliated with the <a>South Carolina Baptist Convention</a>, but has been non-denominational since 1944.
established$$$@@@%%%It officially became co-ed in 1969, although men had been attending since the end of <a>World War II</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From 1988 to 2003, Coker students often interacted with students from <a>South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics</a> (SCGSSM) who lived and took their own courses on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2003, the SCGSSM moved to its own campus a few blocks away.</p>

students$$$@@@%%%<p>The  main campus contains mostly Georgian-style brick buildings, some of which (e.g., Davidson Hall, home to the college's famed round table classrooms) are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Alumni House (Drengaelen), The President's House, The Dean's &amp; President's Offices (David &amp; May Coker House) and The Registrar's Offices (Lawton-Wilson House) are all located in old mansions along the northern edge of campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Hartsville and Coker College owe much to the generosity of the Coker family, founders of <a>Sonoco</a> and Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company.
established$$$@@@%%%The Coker family's patronage of the college has led the vast majority of buildings on campus having Coker somewhere in the name.
established$$$@@@%%%Students often joke to freshmen or visitors that they'll meet them &quot;in the Coker&quot; building as a way to gently initiate newcomers to campus.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Residence Halls</h3>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>There are six student residence halls including <a>Memorial</a> (1914), <a>James Lide Coker III</a> (1962), <a>Belk</a> (1916), <a>Coker</a> (1916) and <a>Grannis</a> (1969), which all adjoin the Linville Dining Hall (1916).
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Richard and Tuck Coker Hall</a> (1988), commonly called the RTC, lies between the library and the other residence halls.
