<h2>History</h2>

<p>Gettysburg College was founded in 1832 as a sister institution for the <a>Lutheran Theological Seminary</a>.
Both owe their inception to <a>Thaddeus Stevens</a>, a <a>Radical Republican</a> and <a>abolitionist</a> from Gettysburg.
The college's original name was Pennsylvania College; it was founded by <a>Samuel Simon Schmucker</a>.
Seven years after Gettysburg College was first founded, it established a medical school, which was located in <a>Philadelphia</a>.
The college was forced to close the medical school in <a>1861</a>, when students from the seceding southern states withdrew to return home, leaving it without adequate revenue.</p>
<h3>Battle of Gettysburg</h3>
<p>In June 1863, southern Pennsylvania was invaded by <a>Confederate</a> forces during the <a>Gettysburg Campaign</a>.
Many local <a>militia</a> forces were formed around the area between <a>Chambersburg</a> and <a>Philadelphia</a> to face the oncoming foe.</p>
Composed mostly of students from the College and Seminary, the 26th PEMR was mustered into service on June 22, 1863.
Four days later, the students saw combat just north of town, skirmishing with advanced units of Confederate <a>division</a> commander <a>Jubal A. Early</a>.
<p>During the <a>Battle of Gettysburg</a>, <a>Pennsylvania Hall</a>, or Old Dorm, was used as both a <a>signal corps</a> station and <a>field hospital</a>.
Due to the geographic position it held, it was used by both Confederate and <a>Union</a> troops during the battle for signal work and surgery.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1863, College President <a>Henry Louis Baugher</a> gave the benediction at the ceremony opening the National Soldiers&#x2019; Cemetery at Gettysburg; speaking after <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>.
Henry Baugher was the president of Gettysburg College from 1850 until his death in 1868.</p>
<p>Early in his military career, <a>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and his wife, <a>Mamie</a>, lived in a house in Gettysburg that was near the college.
Both were fond of the town, so they decided to retire to a working farm adjacent to the battlefield after he left the army.
It was there that President Eisenhower recuperated from his 1955 heart attack.</p>
<p>While living in Gettysburg, Eisenhower became involved with Gettysburg College.
He served on the Gettysburg College <a>Board of Trustees</a>, and he was given an office, which he used when writing his memoirs.
Eisenhower&#x2019;s old office is now named Eisenhower House and is occupied by Gettysburg College&#x2019;s office of admissions.
<p>The college is located on a 200 acre (800,000 m&#x00b2;) campus adjacent to the <a>Gettysburg National Military Park</a>.
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, is 36 miles (60&nbsp;km) from <a>Harrisburg</a>, 55 miles (80&nbsp;km) from <a>Baltimore</a>, 80 miles (130&nbsp;km) from <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, 117 miles (190&nbsp;km) from Philadelphia, and 212 miles (340&nbsp;km) from <a>New York City</a>, and 425 miles (680&nbsp;km) from <a>Boston</a>.</p>
<p>The college's main campus is roughly divided in half by <a>Pennsylvania Hall</a> (administration).
The northern half contains Plank Gym, Masters Hall (physics and astronomy), Musselman Library, the College Union Building, the College Dining Center, Briedenbaugh Hall (English), and several freshman dorms and fraternities.
A section of this part of campus&#x2014;known as &quot;Stine Lake,&quot; is not actually a lake, but rather a quad located outside of the library.
Prior to Musselman Library being built in the late 1970s, and due to Gettysburg's wet climate and drainage issues, the quad and library site would be prone to accumulating water, creating a large, muddy &quot;lake&quot; of sorts.
Today, however, Stine Lake does not flood, but the name has stuck, to the confusion of first-year students.
Additionally, the College Dining Center is known to students and faculty as &quot;Servo,&quot; after a now defunct 1980s food service company, Servomation.</p>
The college has also purchased or leased a large number of buildings for student housing, including residences on Washington Street, Carlisle Street, Middle Street, Stratton Street, and others.</p>
<p>Musselman Library houses the college collection of books, journals, videos, sound recordings, online publications, rare books, manuscripts, and digital collections.
An online catalog, MUSCAT, provides a gateway to all library materials and is accessible through any computer terminal connected to the college network.
The library operates 24 hours a day on weekdays and selected hours during the weekends.
In order to help facilitate late night studying, the library provides free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate at midnight to patrons who bring their own mugs.</p>
<p>Full network capabilities in all campus buildings and each residence hall room.
Students have access to more than 1,300 computers and a complex system of workstations and laboratories.
<a>Wireless</a> connectivity is available across 97% of the campus (the other 3% being the practice fields) and in all of the residence halls.</p>
<p>As an independent institution, the college operates under a charter granted in 1832 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The College is governed by a 39-member board of trustees comprising leaders from a range of professions and walks of life.
<p>The Academic <a>Honor Code</a> has been in effect since <a>1957</a>, and recently has been updated to fit better with today's technology.</p>

<p>Every year, the media groups on campus work together to host a journalism and media conference entitled Speak Up, Write Out, bringing in members of the world, national, and local media to speak in panels open to students of Gettysburg and other nearby colleges.</p>
The student/faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 18 students.
The college hosts one of only 19 chapters of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> in Pennsylvania.</p>
Gettysburg has earned the distinction of having the best win/loss record in the <a>Centennial Conference</a> for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>The college also offers an extensive array of club, intramural, and recreational programs.
Twenty-five percent of Gettysburg's students participate in intercollegiate programs, which include twelve sports for men and twelve sports for women.</p>
The 55,000 foot Center is an upgrade from the former athletic facility, known as the Bream/Wright/Hauser Complex, and mostly opened during October 2009.
<li>A natatorium, complete with eight lanes, four warm-up lanes, and enough space for 350 seated spectators</li>
<li>Additional spaces for yoga, aerobics, spinning and martial arts classes</li>
<li>An upgraded training room with a Hydroworx pool </li>
It has opened in phases:</p>
<li>The first phase was completed during the summer, when Bream/Wright/Hauser was overhauled.
<li>The second phase, which finished in October 2009, included all of the additions except for the climbing walls </li>
<p>The Center was created in order to provide more opportunities for the high percentage of students who like to maintain their fitness regimens and engage in intramural, club sports programs, and exercise classes.
More space was needed, and the Center is important to improve life on campus.&lt;ref
<p>John Jaeger, a 1965 Gettysburg College graduate, donated $1.2 million to encourage others to fund the project.
Another important donor, Robert Ortenzio, provided the largest single gift by a living person in the history of the College, by giving $2 million.&lt;ref
