Founded by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in 1946, Le Moyne is the first Jesuit college to be founded as a co-educational institution.
The College is the second-youngest of the twenty-eight <a>Jesuit</a> <a>college</a>s and <a>universities</a> in the <a>United States</a>, and is the only comprehensive Catholic college in Central New York.
<p>The Le Moyne College  campus is located in a residential neighborhood of the <a>Syracuse, New York</a> suburb of <a>DeWitt, New York</a>, but also borders the <a>Salt Springs neighborhood</a> of <a>Syracuse, New York</a>, facilitating partnerships with the City of Syracuse and regional businesses and organizations.</p>
<p><a>Fred P. Pestello</a>, Ph.D. is the 13th President of Le Moyne College and first permanent lay leader of the college, a position he accepted after a 24-year career at the University of Dayton.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2008, Le Moyne announced that it had received a gift of $50 million from the estate of Robert and Catherine McDevitt, longtime friends of the college who lived in Binghamton, NY.
The legacy was designated for the support of the study of physics, computer science, information systems and religious philosophy.
Neither of the McDevitts attended Le Moyne.
That company changed its name to <a>IBM</a> in 1924.
<p>On September 15, 2009, President Pestello announced the third largest gift in the history of the College, an anonymous donation of $4 million from an alumnus who wishes to support the College's <em>OneLeMoyne</em> strategic initiative.</p>
To earn this degree, students must complete all the requirements for the Integral Honors Program, including taking a series of interdisciplinary seminars as well as researching and writing an interdisciplinary honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty mentor.</p>
<p>The Le Moyne College campus consists of 35 major and minor buildings comprising close to one million gross square feet across roughly .
The college lands encompass a  parcel with a reservoir, for student and faculty research on biodiversity and insect life.
A retail plaza added in Summer 2010 includes a bookstore, coffee shop, and pizzeria.
Construction on a $20 million,  science complex began in June 2010.
<p>Le Moyne College students access the campus network, the Library's system, and the Internet from computer labs located throughout the campus, or from dorm rooms with personal computers.
<p>The Recreation Center accommodates intramural, personal fitness and recreational activities, housing a fitness room with Nautilus and Universal equipment, an Olympic-size indoor pool built for competition, a whirlpool, an elevated jogging track, racket ball courts, and a large multipurpose gymnasium that can be divided into three courts for tennis, volleyball, basketball and other activities.
<p>The Noreen Reale Falcone Library was constructed in 1981.
It houses about 900,000 materials and maintains its own online public access catalog, which is available from both on- and off-campus computers.
<p>Approximately 80 percent of students live in residence halls and townhouses on campus.
Le Moyne's theater program hosts at least two productions each year, housed in the W. Carroll Coyne Performing Arts Center.
The Office of Campus Ministry arranges alternative breaks and service and retreat opportunities, as part of the Jesuit mission of the school.
Students participate in Syracuse arts through collaborations with the Syracuse International Film Festival, the Syracuse Symphony, and the Everson Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Le Moyne is home to <em>The Dolphin</em>, a student newspaper founded in 1947.
A dispute emerged between the administration and the faculty and students involved in the newspaper in 2005, but the paper has evolved into a balanced source of news, opinion, and satire, covering campus sports, politics, and arts, as well as national and global topics.</p>
The campus TV studio in Reilly Hall was renovated during the summer of 2009.
The Cove offers a variety of entertainment on weekends including concerts and movie screenings, and is a popular spot for first-year students.</p>
<p>Le Moyne College begins every academic year with two rituals: (1)'Moving In Weekend,' when current students help to carry the boxes and suitcases of the new, first-year students into the dormitories; and (2)the Mass of the Holy Spirit, which continues a tradition dating back to the first Jesuit school, established in Messina, Sicily in 1548 (probably preceding this date).
The meaning of this Mass is based in Catholic theology; the campus community commits to seeking knowledge as a community of scholars.
<p>Another annual tradition at Le Moyne College is &quot;Dolphy Day,&quot; dating back to its origins in 1971.
Each year, the actual date of the event is kept a secret until the last possible moment, heightening the excitement.
Dolphy Day began as a time to skip classes and relax outside on the first beautiful Spring day, listening to the music of jazz great <a>Eric Dolphy</a>.
<p>Dolphy Day quickly became a symbol of carefree, college fun, a time to be with friends outdoors after a long winter.
A key part of the ritual is the fact that, each year, a &quot;Wizard&quot; is chosen (by the preceding Wizard).
The 40th anniversary of Dolphy Day, celebrated April 7, 2010, honored Eric Dolphy with a life-size bronze sculpture that is the only one of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>Le Moyne College hosts a series of themed, annual lectures: the Berrigan Lecture, Loyola Lecture, and Madden Lecture.</p>
Le Moyne competes in <a>Northeast Ten Conference</a> in all sports.
<p>The Thomas J. Niland Athletic Complex incorporates a  facility with a  competition-size swimming pool, fitness center and weight room, a three-court size multi-purpose gym area, an elevated jogging track, and four racquetball courts.
<p>The College participates in four sports on the club level: men's ice hockey, women's field hockey, rugby, and volleyball, in addition to cheerleading, with both men and women on the squad.</p>
<p>The College conducts an extensive intramural program with sports and competitors that vary each year.
A beacon to us all,&lt;br&gt; And on the Heights our forces join,&lt;br&gt; We rally to your call.</p>
