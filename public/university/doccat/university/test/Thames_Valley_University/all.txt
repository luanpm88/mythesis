established$$$@@@%%%<p>Thames Valley University traces its roots back to 1860, when the <strong>Lady Byron School</strong> was founded at what is now TVU's Ealing campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The school later became <strong>Ealing College of Higher Education</strong>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Slough campus was founded in 1907 as an elementary school.
established$$$@@@%%%By the 1940s, it had become a technical institute, and in the 1970s it became <strong>Thames Valley College of Higher Education</strong>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1990, Ealing College of Higher Education, Thames Valley College of Higher Education, <strong>Queen Charlotte's College of Health Care Studies</strong> and the <strong><a>London College of Music</a></strong> were merged to become the <strong>Polytechnic of West London</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%Two years later, the polytechnic became a university under the <a>Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>, and adopted the name Thames Valley University.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2004, the university merged with <strong>Reading College and School of Arts and Design</strong> (which was originally founded in 1947 as <strong>Reading Technical College</strong>).
established$$$@@@%%%Reading College's sites at Kings Road and Crescent Road became TVU sites.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The merger has made TVU a very large university by UK standards.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Since then, a major rebranding exercise has taken place.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%As a university, TVU aims to be unconventional.
established$$$@@@%%%It appeals largely to a West London and Thames Valley student body, with many students commuting from home.
type$$$@@@%%%It offers a variety of professional training courses unavailable elsewhere.
staff$$$@@@%%%Some 45% of students come from non-white ethnic groups, and 60% study part-time (Guardian 2006).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2009, TVU decided to divest itself of its <a>further education</a> courses, together with its Kings Road site, that it had inherited from the Reading College and School of Arts and Design.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2010 the responsibility for further education, along with the Kings Road site, were transferred to a re-launched <a>Reading College</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%TVU retained its other sites in Reading, including the Crescent Road site that also originated with the Reading College and School of Arts and Design.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In May 2009, TVU announced that it be would closing its Slough campus in 2010 due to the relocation of nursing students, who make up the majority of the student body there, to Reading.
former_names$$$@@@%%%Other courses will be moved to one of the University's west London campuses, although some part-time and nursing courses will remain in Slough at a different site.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In August 2010, it was announced that the university would change its name to the &quot;University of West London&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The university will receive a new logo and <a>brand</a>ing.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Vice-Chancellor Peter John said the change was to reflect the university's development since 1992 and the focus on its Brentford and Ealing campuses.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The <a>Privy Council</a> has granted permission for the name change.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Official figures published in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> magazine in July 2008 reveal that TVU has the best graduate employment record against its benchmark in the country, with almost 95% employed within six months of graduating.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>HESA (<a>Higher Education Statistics Agency</a>) compared data taken from its survey that looks at the destinations of graduates six months after leaving higher education against employment performance indicators for all universities across the UK.
established$$$@@@%%%94.8% of graduates from TVU were employed or in full-time education within six months of leaving their course, which exceeds the university&#x2019;s benchmark figure of 89.8% by 5% - the widest margin of any of the general universities in the league tables (excluding specialist institutions) - making TVU the best in the country in this respect for graduate recruitment.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Controversy</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University has weathered several storms in its short life.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%In the mid-1990s its high-profile Vice-Chancellor, Mike Fitzgerald, ushered through a new networked &quot;New Learning Environment&quot; for undergraduate students, involving a shift to online delivery and assessment.
established$$$@@@%%%The NLE did not last in that form, and in 1998 Fitzgerald resigned following a negative <a>Quality Assurance Agency</a> report (QAA 1998) that cited serious management failures in the delivery of this model (Webster 2000).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By 2003 the QAA report on the University had returned a much more positive verdict, repeated in 2005.
established$$$@@@%%%The NLE has now become a VLE (virtual learning environment) with a &quot;blended e-learning&quot; approach to teaching.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2006 admissions were down and the University has consistently struggled to meet financial targets.
established$$$@@@%%%Lower admissions in 2006 were evident across the HE sector following the introduction of <a>tuition fees</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A 2007 article in <a>The Guardian</a> newspaper said that Thames Valley University was, at that time, on a list of universities whose finances were being monitored by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a>, as their financial stability was under threat unless they acted.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%The Funding Council did not publish this list.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university has in the past offered BSc courses in subjects with foundations unsupported by scientific experimental backing, such as <a>homeopathy</a> and <a>nutritional medicine</a>, and has been criticised heavily by the scientific community for doing so.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>Student life</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Thames Valley University Students' Union</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Thames Valley University Students' Union (also known as TVUSU) is the recognised student organisation of the Thames Valley University, in England.
established$$$@@@%%%The Students' Union represents the 47,000 students at all its sites, from Ealing and Slough to the newest campuses in Reading.
established$$$@@@%%%TVUSU is affiliated to the <a>National Union of Students</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Union has the ground floor of the North Building at the St. Mary's Road campus at which its Coffee Shop, Bar and Gym is located.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In Slough, the Union shares an office with Student Services and in Reading the Union has an office on the ground floor of the Kings Road Campus.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to 2006 TVU operated <a>halls of residence</a> only at the Reading campus, although a number of private houses in the Ealing area were rented by the University and allocated to students studying there.
established$$$@@@%%%In September 2006 the university began to offer halls of residence accommodation to students from the Ealing and Slough campuses at a student and keyworker accommodation site named <strong>Paragon</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%The site won the 'Major Housing Project of the Year' category at the 2007 Building awards, and is in <a>Brentford</a>, approximately two miles away from the Ealing campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Paragon is home to the tallest building to be completed using Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) in the UK, which serves as a  academic facility for the university's human sciences facility.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The student accommodation at Paragon has been criticised by its residents for being too expensive, costing the highest of all London universities' halls of residence along with <a>SOAS</a> in the 2007-2008 year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%TVU defended the costs, asserting that the halls are of an especially high standard.</p>
