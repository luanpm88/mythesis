established$$$@@@%%%<p>   <strong>Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary</strong> (also known as <strong>Moravian College</strong>) is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> and <a>seminary</a> located in <a>Bethlehem</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>, in the <a>Lehigh Valley</a> region.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College traces its roots to the <em>Bethlehem Female Seminary</em>, which was founded in 1742 in <a>Germantown, Pennsylvania</a>, as the <a>first school for young women in the U.S.</a> .
established$$$@@@%%%The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count <a>Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf</a>, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in <a>Nazareth</a> and <a>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the <a>woman's college</a>, the <em>Moravian Seminary and College for Women</em> in 1913.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College also traces its roots to the founding of two boy's schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become <a>Nazareth Hall</a> in 1759.
established$$$@@@%%%It was located in the town of <a>Nazareth</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Nazareth Hall</a> became, in part, <em>Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary</em> in 1807.
established$$$@@@%%%It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature as &quot;Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary&quot; in 1863.
established$$$@@@%%%Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the Seminary and College relocated from Nazareth to a former boys&#x2019; school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The men's Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the <a>Moravian Church</a> in 1888.
established$$$@@@%%%The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property's original brick farmhouse to form the new campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall and still exists today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1954 the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary.
established$$$@@@%%%The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men's College from 1892&#x2013;1954) and the South Campus (the location of the woman's College) into a single collegiate campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The distance between the North and South campuses is about 0.8 miles of Main Street, called the &quot;Moravian Mile.&quot;
