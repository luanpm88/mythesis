<p>   <strong>Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary</strong> (also known as <strong>Moravian College</strong>) is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> and <a>seminary</a> located in <a>Bethlehem</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>, in the <a>Lehigh Valley</a> region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College traces its roots to the <em>Bethlehem Female Seminary</em>, which was founded in 1742 in <a>Germantown, Pennsylvania</a>, as the <a>first school for young women in the U.S.</a> .
The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count <a>Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf</a>, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in <a>Nazareth</a> and <a>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a>.
The Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the <a>woman's college</a>, the <em>Moravian Seminary and College for Women</em> in 1913.</p>
<p>The College also traces its roots to the founding of two boy's schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become <a>Nazareth Hall</a> in 1759.
It was located in the town of <a>Nazareth</a>.
<a>Nazareth Hall</a> became, in part, <em>Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary</em> in 1807.
It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature as &quot;Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary&quot; in 1863.
Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the Seminary and College relocated from Nazareth to a former boys&#x2019; school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall.
<p>The men's Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the <a>Moravian Church</a> in 1888.
The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property's original brick farmhouse to form the new campus.
The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall and still exists today.</p>
<p>In 1954 the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary.
The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men's College from 1892&#x2013;1954) and the South Campus (the location of the woman's College) into a single collegiate campus.
The distance between the North and South campuses is about 0.8 miles of Main Street, called the &quot;Moravian Mile.&quot;
<p> The college is one of <a>the oldest in the United States</a>, after <a>Harvard</a> (1636), the <a>College of William and Mary</a> (1693), <a>St.
John's College</a> in <a>Annapolis</a> (1696), <a>Yale University</a> (1701), and the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> (1740).</p>
The College's varied and highly regarded music programs grow from the <a>Moravian Church</a>'s musical traditions.</p>
USG was officially recognized in 1968.</p>
<p>Moravian College &amp; Theological Seminary awards the following undergraduate and graduate degrees: the <a>Bachelor of Music</a>; the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>; the <a>Bachelor of Science</a>; the <a>Masters of Business Administration</a>; the <a>Master of Education</a>; the Master of Human Resource Management; the Master of Science program in nursing; the <a>Master of Divinity</a>; the <a>Master of Arts in Pastoral Counseling</a>; and the <a>Master of Arts in Theological Studies</a>.

Many of the buildings on that campus were built during the colonial period, including the <a>Brethren's House</a>, built in 1748, which served as a hospital during the <a>Revolutionary War</a>, and currently houses the Music Department.
The facilities have been renovated to include Payne Gallery (renovated from the original women's gymnasium - 1903), the College's two-level art gallery that offers several shows each year, Foy Concert Hall, an auditorium with excellent acoustics.As well as Peter Hall, a medium-sized colonial style recital hall, Hearst Hall, a small colonial style recital hall, and individual student rehearsal rooms and art studios.
The College presents its famed and televised <a>Christmas Vespers</a> services in the <a>Central Moravian Church</a>, located on the corner of Main and Church streets across from Brethren's House.
Many of the buildings on the South Campus are located in a <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> District and Church Street has been referred to as one of the most historic streets in America.</p>
The complex has a cafe, a fitness room, a mail room, and common rooms.
The inside of the suites have a small living room, a full kitchen, their own bathroom, and a sink in the hallway.
The Hill is safe because you must have a swipe to get into the building, a swipe to get onto a floor, and a swipe to get into your room.</p>
<p>Initially purchased in 1888 and settled in 1892, the North Campus is also known as the Main Street campus, as it is physically larger and is the site of the majority of the College's buildings, academic departments, administration, and student residences.
The main building of the North Campus is Comenius Hall, which was built in 1892 and is named for <a>John Amos Comenius</a>, the last bishop of <a>Unity of the Brethren</a>, known as the <strong>&quot;father of modern education&quot;</strong> for his revolutionary educational principles.
Comenius wrote in 1632 that &quot;not the children of the rich or of the powerful only, but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school&quot;.
A statue of Comenius, which was a gift to the College from <a>Charles University of Prague</a> and the Moravian Church of <a>Czechoslovakia</a>, stands in front of Comenius Hall.
<p>Steel Field and its brick grandstand were originally built by <a>Bethlehem Steel</a> to host the <a>Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club</a>, 1913-1930.
In 1925, <a>Lehigh University</a> purchased Steel Field from Bethlehem Steel.
In 1962, Lehigh sold the facility to Moravian College.</p>
