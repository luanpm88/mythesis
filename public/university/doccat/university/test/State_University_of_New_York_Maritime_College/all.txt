established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The State University of New York is the oldest institution of its kind in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%After the <a>Civil War</a> there was a decline in the American maritime industry and there was a growing concern in the professionalism of its officers.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, there was concern over the dangers of accidents on ships, in particular aboard steam vessels.
established$$$@@@%%%Closely tied into this was the push for a modernized navy as advocated by <a>Stephen B. Luce</a> and <a>Alfred Mahon</a>, with Luce in particular leading the charge for merchant marine professional schools.
established$$$@@@%%%Through his efforts, an act was passed by Congress in 1873 that enabled individual states to request from the Navy retired or obsolete vessels to train seamen.
established$$$@@@%%%The state of New York then appealed to the Navy for a training vessel.
established$$$@@@%%%On December 14, 1874, the <a>USS <em>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Mary's</em></a> arrived in New York harbor and became the home of the longest running nautical school in the United States.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally run by the <a>Board of Education of the City of New York</a>, it was conducted as a grammar school that taught common school subjects (along with nautical classes) during the winter term, and then held practical cruises during the summer term.
established$$$@@@%%%As time advanced, the school began to teach more advanced subjects such as navigation and the classification of grammar school became obsolete.
established$$$@@@%%%During this early period, the school was typically run on an annual appropriation of $20,000 to $30,000 with the school often facing closure because its cost per pupil was much higher than in a regular public school mostly due to the overhead of maintaining a ship where students lived.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1907, steam vessels were clearly dominant and the <em>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Mary's</em> was obsolete.
established$$$@@@%%%The school, therefore, acquired he gunboat <a><em>Newport</em></a>, a sail-steam hybrid.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With New York City refusing to pay for the school, in 1913, the state of New York took over its management and renamed it the New York State Nautical School, opening enrollment to students state-wide.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite being under state guidance, the school was close to being closed in 1916, again for budgetary reasons, but efforts from the maritime industry and the school's alumni kept it alive.
nickname$$$@@@%%%After this time, the American merchant marine grew and subsequently a greater demand for trained American merchant marine brought growth to the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During this period, the school was administered by a Board of Governors in addition to the Superintendent.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1921, the school, which had for long moved from berth to berth, found itself at Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor.
type$$$@@@%%%There, they were allowed to use the army facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%Over time, conditions on the island were deemed inadequate to teach modern merchant mariners.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With the growing demand, a push was made by then superintendent <a>James Harvey Tomb</a> beginning in 1927 to acquire a larger ship and a land-based institution.
established$$$@@@%%%The ship came in the form of the <em>Procyon</em> which was renamed the <em>Empire State.</em>
head_label$$$@@@%%%This ship effectively doubled the size of the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Finally, the school, now called the <em>New York Merchant Marine Academy</em>, became land-based in 1934 at the Maritime College's present Throggs Neck campus in Fort Schuyler.
established$$$@@@%%%One of <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s last acts as governor of New York State was to sign the act turning <a>Fort Schuyler</a> and the Throggs Neck peninsula over to the school for use as a shore-based facility of higher education.
established$$$@@@%%%Work restoring Fort Schuyler for the academy's use was done at first by the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) in 1934.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1935, the Academy received a grant from the <a>Works Progress Administration</a>, who restored the fort and allowed the academy to operate there by 1938.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1946, degree conferring status was granted and the academy became a college.
established$$$@@@%%%The college is one of the original institutions incorporated into the State University of New York system in 1948 and was the first of its kind to enroll women, in 1974.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Regiment of Cadets</h2>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>The majority of the <a>undergraduate</a> student body at the Maritime College is organized into a Regiment of Cadets.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Regiment is a military-style organization similar in structure and operation to those of the <a>US federal service academies</a>, but military service for regimental students is not compulsory following graduation.
established$$$@@@%%%The Regiment is led by cadet officers under the supervision of professional personnel of the Office of the Commandant of Cadets.
established$$$@@@%%%It should be noted that participation in the Regiment is only required for students pursuing a USCG License as a Third Mate, or Third Assistant Engineer.
students$$$@@@%%%&quot;Civilian&quot; students (those who do not participate in the Regiment) make up about 1/12th of the undergraduate population.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>During the academic year, regimental students are obligated to fulfill duties above those necessary for their degrees, as a component of their training.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Cadets are required to adhere to regimental rules and regulations, wear prescribed uniforms during business hours, stand watches as part of a duty rotation, and attend formation/muster each morning during the academic week, as well as a weekly uniform inspection on Friday afternoons.
country$$$@@@%%%Prior to their freshman (fourth-class, or MUG - an acronym meaning &quot;Midshipmen Under Guidance&quot; or &quot;Mariner Under Guidance&quot;) year, incoming students attend a two-week indoctrination period, similar to the <a>United States Naval Academy</a>'s &quot;plebe summer,&quot; which is designed to introduce them to the regimental lifestyle.
established$$$@@@%%%During &quot;Indoc,&quot; MUGs go to morning physical training, learn to march, engage in teamwork-building activities, and are immersed in the nautical terminology and lore of the College.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The strict lifestyle for MUGs continues throughout the first year, after which they are permitted privileges (with corresponding responsibilities) pertinent to their increasing seniority within the regiment.
mascot$$$@@@%%%First-class (fourth year) cadets, as the most senior members of the regiment, can assume leadership positions within the regiment and are expected to set the example for their subordinates.
nickname$$$@@@%%%First-class are also permitted the most privileges, and accordingly are also obligated with the most important duties.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College's primary ship, <em><a>Empire State VI</a></em>, is a 565 foot (172.2 m) vessel driven by a 17,160 horsepower (13 MW) steam turbine engine.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally built as the SS <em>Oregon</em>, a <a>break bulk cargo</a> freighter for States Lines, it was converted by the <a>Maritime Administration</a> and delivered to the College for use as a training ship in 1990.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em>Empire State IV</em> is host to cadet watches, classes and work parties during the &quot;Summer Sea Term&quot;, and departs each May with the college's cadets on board for &quot;Summer Sea Term,&quot; a two-month training voyage.
type$$$@@@%%%<a>Athens</a>, <a>Dublin</a>, <a>Barbados</a>, <a>Antwerp</a>, <a>Naples</a>, <a>Barcelona</a>, <a>Genoa</a>, <a>London</a>, <a>Tallinn</a>, <a>Istanbul</a>, <a>Dubrovnik</a>, <a>Split</a>, <a>Kiel</a>, and <a>Copenhagen</a> are some of the recent ports of call for the <em>Empire State VI</em>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<pre></pre>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>During the Summer Sea Term cadets are split into <a>Deck</a> and Engineering disciplines, which are further partitioned into three divisions each.
established$$$@@@%%%These divisions form the basis of shipboard life during Summer Sea Term, and follow a rotating schedule of work, classes, and watchstanding.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Cadets must complete three Sea Terms, each with progressively more responsibilities and higher expectations.
established$$$@@@%%%On Third-class 'cruise,' the first of three, the cadets are given their first exposure to the rigors and requirements of shipboard life.
students$$$@@@%%%They perform basic tasks and are trained in the most fundamental aspects of their respective disciplines.
nickname$$$@@@%%%By the end of their First-class 'cruise,' the last they are required to complete, the cadets are expected to perform competently most of the routine duties of a Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer on watch.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the wake of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>, the <em>Empire State VI</em> was mobilized on September 8, 2005, to provide berthing for up to 700 <a>ConocoPhillips</a> employees and National Guardsmen.
established$$$@@@%%%The ship was readied for departure in record time, and remained in Belle Chasse, <a>Louisiana</a> for six months before returning to her berth at the college on March 8, 2006.
established$$$@@@%%%The crew and the College were awarded a commendation for their service from the <a>Maritime Administration</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <em>Empire State VI</em> is the only registered <a>troopship</a> maintained as part of the US Navy's <a>Ready Reserve</a> Force, prefixed the T-AP 1001.
established$$$@@@%%%The <em>Empire State VI</em> was also activated in 1994 to transport American soldiers home from <a>Mogadishu</a>, Somalia, the first time a troopship was used to transport soldiers since 1968 in Vietnam.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With twenty years of service to the Maritime College (as of 2010), the <em>Empire State VI</em> holds the record as the longest serving power driven training vessel the school has ever owned.
established$$$@@@%%%She is expected to remain in operation until at least 2014.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>The college also &quot;operates&quot; the former .
established$$$@@@%%%The vessel is inoperable since the engines do not work and the vessel was mostly gutted after its decommissioning as a Naval vessel.
established$$$@@@%%%Funding has yet to be acquired to make the necessary repairs, and the vessel has remained moored at the college pier since arriving there under tow in May 2004.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Athletics</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college fields 19 <a>varsity</a> teams (&quot;The Privateers&quot;) in five different conferences, including <a>football</a>, <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>cross-country running</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>rifle</a> and <a>pistol</a>.
