The university has six satellite campuses located in the Florida cities of <a>Dania Beach</a>, <a>Davie</a>, <a>Fort Lauderdale</a>, <a>Jupiter</a>, <a>Port St. Lucie</a>, and in <a>Fort Pierce</a> at the <a>Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution</a>.
Florida Atlantic serves a seven-<a>county</a> region that has a populace of more than three million people and spans more than 100&nbsp;miles (160&nbsp;km) of Florida's eastern coastline.</p>
<p>The university opened in 1964 as the first public university in <a>southeast Florida</a> and the first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate level courses.
Although initial enrollment was only 867&nbsp;students, this number increased in 1984 when the university admitted its first undergraduate students.
<p>Once known strictly as a commuter school, in recent years Florida Atlantic has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional university.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On July 15, 1961, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton.
Florida Atlantic University was built on a 1940s-era army airbase in Boca Raton.
During World War II, the airfield served as the <a>Army Air Corps</a>' sole radar training facility.
The base was built on the existing <a>Boca Raton Airport</a> and on 5,860&nbsp;acres (23.7&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of adjacent land.
A majority of the land was acquired from <a>Japanese-American</a> farmers from the failing <a>Yamato Colony</a>.
The land was seized through <a>eminent domain</a>, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.
<p>By early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to <a>Keesler Air Force Base</a> in <a>Mississippi</a>.
This decision was finalized when, on September 17, 1947, the <a>Fort Lauderdale Hurricane</a> struck South Florida.
According to historian Donald Curl, &quot;the 1947 storm caused extensive damage to the hurriedly built frame structures of the base and was responsible for widespread flooding.&quot;</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic University opened on September 14, 1964, with an initial student body of 867&nbsp;students in five colleges.
The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to <a>President</a> <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> on October 25, 1964 at the dedication and opening of the university.
At the time of its opening, Florida Atlantic's faculty numbered 120 out of a total of 350&nbsp;employees.
On-campus housing for students was first added in September 1965, when Algonquin Hall opened.</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic's history is one of continuing expansion as the university's service population has grown.
The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution &quot;to complement the state's community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions.&quot;
The <a>Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution</a> (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic's seventh campus.
To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated $44 million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution.</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in 1964.
The university's endowment decreased from  $182 million in June 2008 to $142 million in January 2009 due to a worsening economy.
Since its founding, the university has been led by six presidents.
Brogan, a former [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida]], left the university in late 2009 to become Chancellor of the [[State University System of Florida]].
For the undergraduate class of 2012, the acceptance rate was 54%.
<p>The university has ten colleges which altogether offer more than 145 different <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a> and <a>doctoral</a> degree programs.
These ten colleges are the <a>Charles E. Schmidt College of Science</a>, <a>Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing</a>, <a>College Of Architecture, Urban and Public Affairs</a>, <a>College of Business</a>, <a>College of Education</a>, <a>College of Engineering and Computer Science</a>, <a>Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters</a>, <a>Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College</a>, <a>Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine</a> and the Graduate College.</p>
<p>The university offers two honors options: the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College and a University Scholars Program.
The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshmen.</p>
However, the institution has begun gradually increasing standards to improve its graduation and retention rates.
Starting in the summer of 2004, Florida Atlantic began denying entry to students with low GPA and <a>SAT</a> scores.
Prospective students were directed to take remedial courses at a community college to better prepare them for success at the university.
For the 2009&#x2013;2010 academic year, the average high school GPA for an entering freshman was 3.4, with a score of 1069 on the SAT, and a 23 on the <a>ACT</a>.
The average age for first-year students is 18; however, the average age for all undergraduates is 24.
The Lifelong Learning Society operates programs that serve the educational interests of more than 19,000&nbsp;senior citizens by providing classes focusing on subjects of specific interest, and audit options for regular university classes.
Under the university's Commercial Music Program, Hoot/Wisdom Recordings was created in 2002, enabling students to work in all creative and business aspects of the music industry.
This program generated music that landed a Top 10&nbsp;spot on the <a>Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales Chart</a> during its first week of release.
The university's two-story <a>trading room</a> simulator, located in the College of Business, provides hands-on financial education using 25&nbsp;dual-monitor computers and can accommodate 50&nbsp;people at one time.
Florida Atlantic allows local financial businesses to use the Trading Room for training.</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic is classified by <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> as a research university with high research activity.
The university has established notable partnerships with major research institutions such as <a>The Scripps Research Institute</a>, the <a>Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies</a>, and the <a>Max Planck Society</a>.
Following construction of a sister institute on the [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus, Scripps operates out of a state-of-the-art research facility focusing on basic biomedical science, drug discovery, and technology development.
[[Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine]] on Florida Atlantic's Boca Raton Campus]] Since receiving its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured additional funds from other sources, including federal and private research grants.
As a result, both centers have engaged in academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in <a>ocean engineering</a>, <a>marine biotechnology</a>, <a>functional genomics</a>, <a>proteomics</a>, and <a>bioinformatics</a>.
As a result of this research, in 2007 the university and <a>Lockheed Martin</a> announced  an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.</p>
<p>The university houses both an Imaging Technology Center and a <a>NASA</a> Imaging Technology Space Center.
Located in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the centers specialize in digital imaging research and development for use in both government and commercial applications in the areas of <a>medical technology</a>, <a>surveillance</a>, <a>communication</a>s, <a>education</a>, <a>inspection</a>, <a>scientific observation</a>, <a>manufacturing</a>, visual recognition and identification, and <a>motion picture</a> and <a>digital video</a>.
The Florida Atlantic Imaging Technology Center is developing a <a>curriculum</a> for <a>digital imaging</a> and processing, thereby establishing Florida Atlantic as the only university in the nation to offer this technical concentration.
The NASA Imaging Technology Center is one of 12&nbsp;NASA Research Partnership Centers throughout the nation which develop dual-use research and development with the participation of NASA and other related industries in the US.
<p>For 2008, Florida Atlantic University was classified as a second-tier university by the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>'s</em> rankings of &quot;Best Colleges.&quot;
<em>U.S. News</em> ranks universities into one of four tiers, with one being the highest, based on how they compare with other colleges in a peer assessment, retention rates, student selectivity, faculty resources, financial resources, graduation rates, and the amount of alumni giving.
The university was named one of the 146 &quot;Best Southeastern Colleges&quot; in the United States by the <a>Princeton Review</a>.
The Review identifies colleges and universities that stand out with within each region of America.
For 2007, Florida Atlantic was ranked 233rd in the nation by <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em>, up from 240th in 2006.
The magazine based its rankings on the following three criteria: &quot;how well a university performs as an engine of social mobility (ideally helping the poor to get rich rather than the very rich to get very, very rich), how well a university does in fostering scientific and humanistic research, and how well a university promotes an ethic of service to country.&quot;
The university was also ranked 28th in the United States and fourth in Florida by <em><a>The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education</a></em> magazine for awarding 738 bachelor's degrees to <a>Hispanic</a> students during the 2006&#x2013;2007 academic year.</p>

<p> <a>right|thumb|The Village Apartments on the Boca campus</a> Florida Atlantic's main campus in <a>Boca Raton</a> was established on the remnants of a World War II American <a>Army airbase</a> in 1964.
Spanning 850&nbsp;<a>acre</a>s (3.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) near the <a>Atlantic Ocean</a>, the site is located between the cities of <a>Palm Beach</a> and Fort Lauderdale.
The campus was designated a <a>burrowing owl</a> sanctuary in 1971 by the <a>Audubon Society</a>.
<p>The Boca Raton Campus is home to a wide variety of university programs and facilities.
In an effort to create a more traditional, first-choice college atmosphere on the Boca Raton Campus, the university is working to develop an &quot;Innovation Village&quot;.
Florida Atlantic's project will be one of only two athletics/retail venues located on the campus of a Florida university; a similar Innovation Village-type project is located at the <a>University of Central Florida</a>.
The construction of the stadium has also created a controversy between Florida Atlantic and the City of Boca Raton.
In 2002, the university and the city signed an agreement requiring an additional <a>I-95</a>&nbsp;interchange be under construction before a stadium could be built on campus.
The Boca campus also houses a number of other programs, including the <a>A.D. Henderson University School</a>, FAU High School, one of two Florida Atlantic Research Parks, and the Lifelong Learning Society.</p>
<p>In addition to the Boca campus in southern <a>Palm Beach County</a>, Florida Atlantic operates a campus in northern Palm Beach County, in <a>Jupiter</a>.
The John D. MacArthur Campus, named after <a>businessman</a> and <a>philanthropist</a> <a>John D. MacArthur</a>, was established in 1999 to serve residents of central and northern Palm Beach and southern Martin Counties.
The MacArthur Campus  occupies 45&nbsp;acres (0.18&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), upon which are eight classroom and office buildings, a library, a 500-seat auditorium, two residence halls, a dining hall, museum building, and utility plant.
The MacArthur Campus also houses the <a>Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College</a>, <a>Scripps Florida</a>, and the Max Planck Florida Institute.
The institute is part of Florida Atlantic&#x2019;s Department of Ocean Engineering which was founded in 1965 as the first ocean engineering undergraduate program in the nation.
The campus is located on 8&nbsp;acres (0.03&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the <a>Intracoastal Waterway</a>.
SeaTech is home to university faculty  and students engaged in sponsored ocean engineering research and development in the areas of <a>acoustics</a>, marine vehicles, <a>hydrodynamics</a> and <a>physical oceanography</a>, marine materials and <a>nanocomposites</a>.
The university operated in the existing infrastructure for eight years before joining with Indian River State College to open a joint-use facility.
Both institutions continue to operate out of this  facility.
<p>In November 2007 Florida Atlantic University became a signatory member of the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPPC).
Prior to joining the ACUPCC, the University had the Christine E Lynn College of Nursing building certified as LEED Silver (recently re-certified as LEED Gold).
In June 2009 the University partnered with Living Room Theaters, Inc. to break ground on a classroom and office building.
<p>Florida Atlantic's green building initiatives earned the University a &quot;B&quot; on the Green Building section of the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card.
FAU received an overall grade of &quot;C-&quot; on the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.</p>
The university's athletics program began in 1979, when Florida Atlantic first started sponsoring intercollegiate teams.
Since then, the university has worked to expand the quality of its intercollegiate program by attracting coaches such as <a>Howard Schnellenberger</a>, <a>Matt Doherty</a>, <a>Rex Walters</a> and <a>Mike Jarvis</a>.
In 2006, the athletic department was ranked 79th in the nation by the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a> (NACDA).
In just the seventh year of the football program's history, and the third year playing in Division I, Florida Atlantic set NCAA records by both becoming the youngest program ever to receive an invitation to, and win, a <a>bowl game</a>.
As a result of the New Orleans Bowl the university has seen a surge in school spirit.</p>
During the 2006&#x2013;2007 season, the men's basketball team was noted as &quot;one of the <a>Sun Belt Conference</a>'s top offensive teams,&quot; with a &quot;scary offense&quot; that earned it the reputation of the &quot;best shooting team in the conference.&quot;
The baseball team was also recognized by the NCAA as ranking in the Top&nbsp;10 in five team categories.
The team was also ranked third in the nation in home runs per game (1.66) and in <a>slugging percentage</a> (.563).</p>
<p>[[File:Bb2 fau fiu celebration.JPG|right|thumb|Florida Atlantic students celebrating a basketball victory over rival Florida International in the [[FAU Arena|Burrow]]]] Since the inception of the athletics program, a number of sports-related traditions and school spirit organizations have been started at the university.
A recent tradition known as &quot;Bury the Burrow in Red&quot; calls for Florida Atlantic students to wear as much red as possible and fill the <a>Burrow</a>, the university's multi-purpose arena, during the annual <a>basketball</a> game between Florida Atlantic and nearby <a>Florida International University</a> (FIU).
The group began in February 2002 to support the men's basketball program during the team&#x2019;s run for the <a>Atlantic Sun Conference Championship</a>.
<p>Another traditional competition between Florida Atlantic and Florida International is the annual <a>Shula Bowl</a>.
This intercollegiate football game is named after legendary coach <a>Don Shula</a>; the game originates from the fact that both head coaches, Florida Atlantic's <a>Howard Schnellenberger</a> and former Florida International coach <a>Don Strock</a>, worked under Shula at some point during their careers.
As a home game, the competition takes place at <a>Sun Life Stadium</a>; as an away game, the bowl is played at <a>FIU Stadium</a> in <a>Miami</a>.
As of 2008, 2,421&nbsp;students (9% of the university body) live on-campus in Boca Raton.
The university also offers upper-division undergraduate and graduate student housing in the Village Student Apartments, as well as a Business and Professional Women's Scholarship House for women with a strong academic background.
The freshman program offers 16 different concentrations, including business, nursing, and education.
The Living program offers six concentrations for students residing in the Heritage Park Towers <a>dormitory</a>, including engineering and computer science and a Women's Leadership program.
<p>Florida Atlantic's <a>homecoming</a>, also known as the &quot;Owl Prowl,&quot; is celebrated annually in the fall semester.
These Greek organizations provide academic motivation, forums for education on various life issues, <a>philanthropy</a> and service to the community; contribute to the campuses through participation in campus life; and foster opportunities for people with similar values to engage in friendship.
The highpoint of Greek life at Florida Atlantic is &quot;Greek Week.&quot;
This event is held annually during the spring semester and showcases a number of themed competitions between the university's Greek organizations.
However, a Greek Life Housing <a>task force</a> has been formed to explore various housing models, including the cost of construction, &quot;and make recommendations on how to improve the overall quality of the Greek housing....&quot; Greek housing is planned for the upcoming Innovation Village complex.</p>
<p> Florida Atlantic University has awarded more than 110,000&nbsp;degrees to nearly 105,000&nbsp;alumni worldwide since its opening.
