<p>UPR-RP is the largest campus in terms of student population of the <a>University of Puerto Rico System</a>, and is the first public university in the <a>history of Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 1900 the <em>Escuela Normal Industrial</em> (Normal Industrial School) was established in <a>Fajardo, Puerto Rico</a> as the first Higher Education institution of Puerto Rico, dedicated to those who would become teachers on the island.

A year later, in 1901, it was moved to the town of <a>R&#x00ed;o Piedras</a>, because the roads to Fajardo were in a terrible condition.
In the mild and studying-favourable nature around what was known by the time as &quot;<em>La Convalecencia</em>&quot; - the summer residence of the Spanish Governors of Puerto Rico- was placed, temporally, the Normal School.
Its objectives were still the formation of new teachers for the island.</p>
<p>On March 12, 1903, under the administration of the Public Instruction Commissioner, Samuel McCune Lindsay, the 2nd Legislative Assembly approved a law creating the <a>University of Puerto Rico</a> in R&#x00ed;o Piedras, transferring all the funding of the Insular Normal School there.
This School became the first department of the University, what is now the Faculty of Education, becoming the nucleus of the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Now legally established, the University of Puerto Rico started its first academic year (1903&#x2013;1904) with an enrollment of 173 students.
Due to the scarcity of teachers in the island, most of these students were appointed by the Department of Public Instruction to teach at schools without having finished four years of college.
The first graduating class (June 1907) consisted of 13 students.</p>
<p>In 1907, the first class graduated from the normal course of four years after the university was legally established.
Among the studenst in that class were Carlota Matienzo, Isabel Andr&#x00e9;u, Loa&#x00ed;za Cordero, Marina Roviro, and [[Juan Herrero.</p>
<p>On September 22, 1913, the departments of Law and Pharmacology were established.
After 1917, the departments of Normal Education, Liberal Arts, Pharmacology, and Law required a high school diploma for admission.</p>

<p>On February 21, 1931, Dr. <a>Carlos E. Chard&#x00f3;n</a> was appointed as chancellor of the university.
During his tenure the university experienced significant endowments.
These were used in expansion of the physical facilities at the R&#x00ed;o Piedras and <a>Mayag&#x00fc;ez Campus</a>es.
The most important part of this period was the expansion of the buildings of the University as part of a plan for the rehabilitation of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>In 1936, architect <a>Rafael Carmoega</a>, working under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA), designed the distinctive University of Puerto Rico clock tower based on the 1924 Parsons Plan.
The iconic university clock tower was built in 1937 and christened as the <a>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> tower, in honor of that U.S. president and his interest in the building of the university.
Also at the entrance of the Tower, the coats of arms of the nations of the Americas appear in a bronze circle, as a symbol of Panamerican Union.</p>
<p>The University was the site of social upheaval during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for <a>civil rights</a>, the <a>independence of Puerto Rico</a>, and taking the <a>ROTC</a> out of the campus.
In 1970 <a>Antonia Mart&#x00ed;nez</a> was murdered by the police when they repressed students.
As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de Le&#x00f3;n Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening.
A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate.
A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint.

The Chancellor of the Campus is the top academic and administrative officer and presides over its two deliberative bodies: the Administrative Board and the Academic Senate.</p>
<p>The <strong>Administrative Board</strong>, composed of the deans, two senators representing the faculty, and one student senator, advices the Chancellor in matters pertaining to the university program.
The Board makes recommendations on leaves and faculty aid applications, and grants promotions and tenures.</p>
It is composed of the deans, the director of the library system, elected faculty representatives from all the colleges and schools, student senators, and representatives from the staff of academic advisors.
Its members participate on the institutional processes, establishing academic rules and collaborating with other organisms of the University of Puerto Rico system.</p>
The Council is composed of several representatives to the student council, elected by each School or College, the number of representatives varies depending on the number of students enrolled in the School or College, and the President and Senator of each School and College, for a total of around 50 members.
<p>Having its origins in the 1920s, the Student Council was dissolved in 1948 while <a>Jaime Benitez</a> was chancellor, and under the council presidency of <a>Juan Mari Bras</a> and it was not until 1968 that the Student Council was re-installed under the name General Student Council and under the council presidency of <a>David Noriega</a>.</p>
<p>The General Student Council is governed by the Board of Directors, which is elected from among the council's members and is composed of:</p>
<p>Additionally, they select Representatives to the Campus' Administrative Board and the University's University Board, both of them with an Alternate Representative.
<p>Every College and School has a student council of its own, composed by a President, a Board of Directors, the College or School's Student Senator (and, if available for the College/School, an alternate senator), Representatives to the General Student Council (numbers vary from 1 up to 5, depending on the School or college's student population), and representatives of each department or subdivision present in the School or College.</p>
<p>The <a>University High School</a>, technically a part of the campus and its School of Education, has a Student Council independent of the campus student council system.
It represents several hundred junior and senior high school students.</p>
