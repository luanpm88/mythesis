<p>John Sloan Dickey's commitment to the <a>liberal arts</a>, or, as he termed them &quot;the liberating arts,&quot; was perhaps best expressed in an innovative course on &quot;Great Issues,&quot; designed to introduce seniors to the problems of national and international relations they would face as citizens.
Dickey sought to expand the horizons of Dartmouth beyond Hanover and introduced foreign studies programs, a public affairs internship, and various social action programs.
