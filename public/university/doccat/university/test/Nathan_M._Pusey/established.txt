<p> <strong>Nathan Marsh Pusey</strong> (April 4, 1907 &ndash; November 14, 2001) was a prominent <a>American</a> university educator.</p>
<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<p>Pusey was born in <a>Council Bluffs, Iowa</a> to John and Rosa Pusey.
<p>Pusey's first teaching post after graduating was at <a>Riverdale Country School</a>.
He progressed to <a>Lawrence College</a>, then to <a>Scripps College</a>, and later to <a>Wesleyan University</a>.
He served as president of Lawrence College (1944&#x2013;1953), and later as the 24th <a>president of Harvard University</a> (1953&#x2013;1971).</p>
<p>Pusey vigorously opposed <a>McCarthyism</a> in the 1950s and supported the U.S. <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1960s.
His clashes with <a>Joseph McCarthy</a> were especially significant because Pusey's position at Lawrence College placed him in the senator's hometown (<a>Appleton, Wisconsin</a>) and amid the political power base of the then-conservative <a>Fox Valley</a>.
As president of the college, Pusey held the community's respect, and his vocal criticisms of McCarthy resounded loudly in the area.
He was, on the other hand, a deeply religious man and a somewhat traditionalist scholar, and he was appalled by the <a>student radicalism</a> that raged in American universities in the late 1960s.
He complained bitterly that &quot;learning has almost ceased&quot; in many universities, because of the violent, revolutionary activities of a &quot;small group of overeager young . .
In April 1969, student activists occupied Harvard's <a>University Hall</a> (the building that housed most of the administrative offices) in protest over the presence of <a>ROTC</a> on campus at the height of the <a>Vietnam War</a>, and in response Pusey summoned the police to arrest the demonstrators.
Although his action was legal, it was widely criticized, and the resulting furor probably contributed to his early retirement in 1971.</p>
<p>After Harvard, Pusey was president of the <a>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> (1971&#x2013;1975) and president of the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia (1979&#x2013;1980).</p>
