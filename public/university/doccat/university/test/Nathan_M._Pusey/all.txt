established$$$@@@%%%<p> <strong>Nathan Marsh Pusey</strong> (April 4, 1907 &ndash; November 14, 2001) was a prominent <a>American</a> university educator.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>Early life and education</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pusey was born in <a>Council Bluffs, Iowa</a> to John and Rosa Pusey.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%He was educated at <a>Harvard University</a> (<a>B.A.</a>, 1928, <a>M.A.</a>, 1932, <a>Ph.D.</a>, 1937), where he studied first <a>English literature</a> and then <a>ancient history</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Educational career</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pusey's first teaching post after graduating was at <a>Riverdale Country School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He progressed to <a>Lawrence College</a>, then to <a>Scripps College</a>, and later to <a>Wesleyan University</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%He served as president of Lawrence College (1944&#x2013;1953), and later as the 24th <a>president of Harvard University</a> (1953&#x2013;1971).</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Political positions</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Pusey vigorously opposed <a>McCarthyism</a> in the 1950s and supported the U.S. <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1960s.
established$$$@@@%%%His clashes with <a>Joseph McCarthy</a> were especially significant because Pusey's position at Lawrence College placed him in the senator's hometown (<a>Appleton, Wisconsin</a>) and amid the political power base of the then-conservative <a>Fox Valley</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%As president of the college, Pusey held the community's respect, and his vocal criticisms of McCarthy resounded loudly in the area.
established$$$@@@%%%He was, on the other hand, a deeply religious man and a somewhat traditionalist scholar, and he was appalled by the <a>student radicalism</a> that raged in American universities in the late 1960s.
established$$$@@@%%%He complained bitterly that &quot;learning has almost ceased&quot; in many universities, because of the violent, revolutionary activities of a &quot;small group of overeager young . .
mascot$$$@@@%%%who feel they have a special calling to redeem society.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%In April 1969, student activists occupied Harvard's <a>University Hall</a> (the building that housed most of the administrative offices) in protest over the presence of <a>ROTC</a> on campus at the height of the <a>Vietnam War</a>, and in response Pusey summoned the police to arrest the demonstrators.
established$$$@@@%%%Although his action was legal, it was widely criticized, and the resulting furor probably contributed to his early retirement in 1971.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After Harvard, Pusey was president of the <a>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> (1971&#x2013;1975) and president of the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia (1979&#x2013;1980).</p>
