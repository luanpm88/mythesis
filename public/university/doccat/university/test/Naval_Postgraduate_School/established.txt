<p> The <strong>Naval Postgraduate School</strong> (NPS) is an <a>accredited</a> research university operated by the <a>United States Navy</a>.
Located in <a>Monterey, California</a>, it grants both <a>master's degree</a>s and <a>doctoral degrees</a>.
<p>Under a recent joint agreement between the Air Force and Navy, and codified by the 2005 <a>Base Realignment and Closure</a> Commission, AFIT and the Naval Postgraduate School have realigned their academic programs to reduce duplication, and both schools will be under the oversight of a common oversight panel.
<p>Prior to being purchased by the U.S. Government, the school's campus was operated as the <a>Del Monte Hotel</a>.
Some NPS buildings and the cactus garden date from that time.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>On June 9, 1909, <a>Secretary of the Navy</a> <a>George von L. Meyer</a> signed General Order No. 27, establishing a school of <a>marine engineering</a> at <a>Annapolis, Maryland</a>.
<p>On October 31, 1912, Meyer signed Navy General Order No. 233, which renamed the school the <strong>Postgraduate Department of the United States Naval Academy</strong>.
The order established courses of study in ordnance and <a>gun</a>nery, <a>electrical engineering</a>, <a>radio telegraphy</a>, <a>naval construction</a>, and <a>civil engineering</a> as well as continuing the original program in marine engineering.
<p>During <a>World War II</a>, <a>Fleet Admiral</a> <a>Ernest King</a>, chief of naval operations and commander-in-chief of both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, established a commission to review the role of graduate education in the Navy.
In 1945, <a>Congress</a> passed legislation to make the school a fully-<a>accredited</a>, degree-granting graduate institution.
Two years later, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the purchase of an independent campus for the school.

Negotiations with the Del Monte Properties Company led to the purchase of the hotel and 627 acres (2.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of surrounding land for $2.13 million.
<p>In December 1951, the Postgraduate School moved across the nation, establishing its current campus in Monterey.
The Space Systems Academic Group of NPS has graduated thirty-three astronauts, more than any other graduate school in the country .
