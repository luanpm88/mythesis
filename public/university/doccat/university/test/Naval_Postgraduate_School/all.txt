established$$$@@@%%%<p> The <strong>Naval Postgraduate School</strong> (NPS) is an <a>accredited</a> research university operated by the <a>United States Navy</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Located in <a>Monterey, California</a>, it grants both <a>master's degree</a>s and <a>doctoral degrees</a>.
country$$$@@@%%%The school also offers research fellowship opportunities at the postdoctoral level through the National Research Council research associateship program.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The NPS student population is mostly active-duty officers from all branches of the U.S. Military, although U.S. Government civilians and members of foreign militaries can also matriculate under a variety of programs.
free$$$@@@%%%Most of the faculty are civilians.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Air Force Institute of Technology</a> (AFIT) serves a similar purpose for the U.S. Air Force.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The U.S. Army does not have a comparable school; Army officers study at the <strong>Naval Postgraduate School</strong> or AFIT.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Under a recent joint agreement between the Air Force and Navy, and codified by the 2005 <a>Base Realignment and Closure</a> Commission, AFIT and the Naval Postgraduate School have realigned their academic programs to reduce duplication, and both schools will be under the oversight of a common oversight panel.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As an example of the consolidation, Navy officers are sent to learn aeronautical engineering at AFIT, while the Air Force officers learn meteorology at the Naval Postgraduate School.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to being purchased by the U.S. Government, the school's campus was operated as the <a>Del Monte Hotel</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Some NPS buildings and the cactus garden date from that time.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On June 9, 1909, <a>Secretary of the Navy</a> <a>George von L. Meyer</a> signed General Order No. 27, establishing a school of <a>marine engineering</a> at <a>Annapolis, Maryland</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On October 31, 1912, Meyer signed Navy General Order No. 233, which renamed the school the <strong>Postgraduate Department of the United States Naval Academy</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%The order established courses of study in ordnance and <a>gun</a>nery, <a>electrical engineering</a>, <a>radio telegraphy</a>, <a>naval construction</a>, and <a>civil engineering</a> as well as continuing the original program in marine engineering.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During <a>World War II</a>, <a>Fleet Admiral</a> <a>Ernest King</a>, chief of naval operations and commander-in-chief of both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, established a commission to review the role of graduate education in the Navy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1945, <a>Congress</a> passed legislation to make the school a fully-<a>accredited</a>, degree-granting graduate institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Two years later, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the purchase of an independent campus for the school.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Herrmann Hall</a> A post-war review team, which had examined 25 sites nationwide, had recommended the old Hotel Del Monte in Monterey as a new home for the Postgraduate School.
established$$$@@@%%%Negotiations with the Del Monte Properties Company led to the purchase of the hotel and 627 acres (2.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of surrounding land for $2.13 million.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In December 1951, the Postgraduate School moved across the nation, establishing its current campus in Monterey.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Today, the school has over 40 programs of study including highly regarded M.S and Ph.D. programs in electrical and computer engineering (NRC Ranking 68,), mechanical and astronautical engineering (NRC Ranking 30), space systems and satellite engineering, physics, oceanography (NRC Ranking 22), meteorology, applied mathematics, <a>computer science</a> (NRC Ranking 83), <a>operations research</a>, business and public policy (AACSB and NASPAA accredited, US News ranking 45), international relations, and other disciplines, all with an emphasis on military applications.
established$$$@@@%%%The Space Systems Academic Group of NPS has graduated thirty-three astronauts, more than any other graduate school in the country .
country$$$@@@%%%NPS is home to the Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research (CISR) and the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS).
country$$$@@@%%%CISR is America's foremost center for defense-related research and education in Information Assurance (IA), Inherently Trustworthy Systems (ITC), and defensive information warfare; and CHDS provides the first homeland security master's degree in the United States.</p>
