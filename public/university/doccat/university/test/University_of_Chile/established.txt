<p>The <strong>University of Chile</strong> () is the largest and oldest institution of higher education in <a>Chile</a> and one of the oldest in the Americas.
Founded in 1842 as the replacement and continuation of the former colonial Royal University of San Felipe (1738)<em> (Spanish: Real Universidad de San Felipe)</em>, the university is often called <em>Casa de Bello</em> (House of Bello) in honor of its first president, <a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Higher education in Chile in colonial times dates to 19 August 1622, when the first university in Chile, <em>Santo <a>Tom&#x00e1;s de Aquino</a></em>, was founded.
On 28 July 1738, its name changed to <em>Real Universidad de San Felipe</em>, in honor of King <a>Philip V of Spain</a>.
<p>In 1841 the minister of public education, <a>Manuel Montt</a>, conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the &quot;advancement and development of sciences and humanities&quot;.
<a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a> formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on 19 November 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.</p>
<p>The Universidad de Chile was formally opened on 17 September 1843.
By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; <a>Education</a> Sciences, <a>Legal</a> &amp; <a>Social Sciences</a>, <a>Biology</a> &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, <a>Agronomy</a> &amp; <a>Veterinary</a>, and <a>Fine Art</a>s.</p>
<p>Almost all of Chile's presidents graduated from the University of Chile, including all of those in the 20th century with the exception of <a>Eduardo Frei Montalva</a> (<a>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a>), General <a>Carlos Ib&#x00e1;&#x00f1;ez del Campo</a> and former military dictator General <a>Augusto Pinochet Ugarte</a>.</p>
<p>During <a>Augusto Pinochet</a>'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University suffered many profound changes.
On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 stated that the University's Presidents would be designated by the Military Regime.</p>
<p>These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the military government as a way to severely diminish the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements.
Simultaneous to this process, the <a>Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x00f3;lica de Chile</a> was heavily supported so that it would grow to a size comparable to the University of Chile.
In concrete terms, in 1973 the University of Chile had a record number of students enrolled: over 65,000 students.
In contrast, the Catholic University of Chile has grown from approximately 15,000 students in 1973 to over 21,650.
Several private universities were created towards the end of the military regime, and some of these institutions have shown tendencies towards neoliberal economics.
In this way the &quot;<a>Chicago Boys</a>&quot; have been able to perpetuate their influences on Chilean economics and public policies through higher education.</p>
<p>In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains as one of Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.</p>
