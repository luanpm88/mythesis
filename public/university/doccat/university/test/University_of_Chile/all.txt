established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Chile</strong> () is the largest and oldest institution of higher education in <a>Chile</a> and one of the oldest in the Americas.
established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1842 as the replacement and continuation of the former colonial Royal University of San Felipe (1738)<em> (Spanish: Real Universidad de San Felipe)</em>, the university is often called <em>Casa de Bello</em> (House of Bello) in honor of its first president, <a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%Notable alumni include two Nobel laureates (<a>Pablo Neruda</a> and <a>Gabriela Mistral</a>) and twenty heads of state among many others.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Background</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Higher education in Chile in colonial times dates to 19 August 1622, when the first university in Chile, <em>Santo <a>Tom&#x00e1;s de Aquino</a></em>, was founded.
established$$$@@@%%%On 28 July 1738, its name changed to <em>Real Universidad de San Felipe</em>, in honor of King <a>Philip V of Spain</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1841 the minister of public education, <a>Manuel Montt</a>, conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the &quot;advancement and development of sciences and humanities&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a> formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on 19 November 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Universidad de Chile was formally opened on 17 September 1843.
type$$$@@@%%%During this period, the university consisted of five <a>faculties</a> (<em>facultades</em>): <a>Humanities</a> &amp; <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Mathematical</a> <a>Science</a>s &amp; <a>Physics</a>, <a>Law</a> &amp; <a>Political Science</a>s, <a>Medicine</a>, and <a>Theology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; <a>Education</a> Sciences, <a>Legal</a> &amp; <a>Social Sciences</a>, <a>Biology</a> &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, <a>Agronomy</a> &amp; <a>Veterinary</a>, and <a>Fine Art</a>s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Almost all of Chile's presidents graduated from the University of Chile, including all of those in the 20th century with the exception of <a>Eduardo Frei Montalva</a> (<a>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a>), General <a>Carlos Ib&#x00e1;&#x00f1;ez del Campo</a> and former military dictator General <a>Augusto Pinochet Ugarte</a>.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h3>Major Reforms during Military Regime of 1973-1989</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During <a>Augusto Pinochet</a>'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University suffered many profound changes.
established$$$@@@%%%On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 stated that the University's Presidents would be designated by the Military Regime.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The second major blow to the University's integrity came on 3 January 1981, when another Decree completely restructured the University.
free_label$$$@@@%%%All of its provincial campuses were separated, cojoined with provincial campuses of the Universidad T&#x00e9;cnica del Estado (now <a>Universidad de Santiago de Chile</a> and <a>Universidad de Atacama</a>) and designated as separate universities, such as the <a>Universidad de Talca</a>, <a>Universidad de Valparaiso</a>, the Instituto Pedag&#x00f3;gico (Pedagogical Institute, now the <a>Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educaci&#x00f3;n</a>), the <a>Universidad de Antofagasta</a>, the <a>Universidad de Tarapac&#x00e1;</a>, Instituto Professional de Osorno (now <a>Universidad de los Lagos</a>), Instituto Professional de Chill&#x00e1;n (now <a>Universidad del B&#x00ed;o-B&#x00ed;o</a>), <a>Universidad de la Frontera</a>, and <a>Universidad de la Serena</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the military government as a way to severely diminish the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements.
established$$$@@@%%%Simultaneous to this process, the <a>Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x00f3;lica de Chile</a> was heavily supported so that it would grow to a size comparable to the University of Chile.
established$$$@@@%%%In concrete terms, in 1973 the University of Chile had a record number of students enrolled: over 65,000 students.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Today it has only 26,000 students.
established$$$@@@%%%In contrast, the Catholic University of Chile has grown from approximately 15,000 students in 1973 to over 21,650.
established$$$@@@%%%Several private universities were created towards the end of the military regime, and some of these institutions have shown tendencies towards neoliberal economics.
established$$$@@@%%%In this way the &quot;<a>Chicago Boys</a>&quot; have been able to perpetuate their influences on Chilean economics and public policies through higher education.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains as one of Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.</p>
