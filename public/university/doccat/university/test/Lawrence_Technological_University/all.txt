established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was a firm belief in the future that motivated Russell E. Lawrence to found a university in 1932&#x2014;in the midst of the economic chaos of the Great Depression.
established$$$@@@%%%While less farsighted individuals made predictions of gloom, Russell Lawrence and his brother, E. George Lawrence (who led Lawrence Tech from 1934 to 1964), turned a dream of preparing students for leadership in the new technical era into reality.
