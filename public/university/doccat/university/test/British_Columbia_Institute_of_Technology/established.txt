<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School was (BCVS) established in Burnaby, opening at Willingdon and Canada Way.
It was the first permanent trades school of its kind in British Columbia; its programs included carpentry, welding and aircraft maintenance.
A year later, plans were announced to establish the British Columbia Institute of Technology on adjacent land.
It was the first provincial institution dedicated to advanced technical education in BC, and its principal was named in 1962.
It offered education in the areas of engineering, business and health, enrolling 498 students in 1964.
<p>BCIT, UBC, SFU, and ECUAD jointly opened the Great Northern Way Campus in 2002.
