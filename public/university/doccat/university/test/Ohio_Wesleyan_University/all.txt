established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university &quot;of the highest order&quot; in central Ohio.
established$$$@@@%%%To that end, they purchased the <a>Mansion House Hotel</a>, a former health resort with its Sulfur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.
established$$$@@@%%%Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing &quot;the <a>democratic</a> spirit of teaching&quot;, which was approved by the <a>Ohio</a> State <a>Legislature</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Early in the following year they opened the <a>college preparatory</a> Academy and formed a <a>Board of Trustees</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after <a>John Wesley</a>, founder of <a>Methodism</a>, opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but <a>nonsectarian</a> institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Ohio Wesleyan's first president, <a>Edward Thomson</a>, stated in his <a>inaugural address</a> on August 5, 1846 that the school was &quot;a product of the <a>liberality</a> of the local people.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%This liberal philosophy  contributed to Wesleyan's vocal opposition to <a>slavery</a> in the 1850s.
established$$$@@@%%%In the annual celebration for <a>George Washington</a>'s birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick endorsed Ohio Wesleyan's &quot;ideals of democracy&quot; during his oration.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Sturges Hall</a> was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in <a>Merrick Hall</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a>, established in 1853, merged with Wesleyan in 1877.
established$$$@@@%%%Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and <a>music education</a> greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).
free_label$$$@@@%%%To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position.
image_size$$$@@@%%%<a>University Hall</a>, <a>Slocum Library</a>, extensions to the <a>Monnett campus</a>, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.

established$$$@@@%%%Between 1891 and 1895, Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for <a>physics</a>, <a>zoology</a>, <a>geology</a>, <a>speech</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>English</a>, and <a>economics</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.
type$$$@@@%%%Two professional schools for <a>law</a> and <a>medicine</a> were formed in 1896.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word &quot;university&quot; in the institution's name.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree was abolished, which left only the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Two students were selected as <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> in 1905 and 1909.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Edwards Gymnasium</a> was built in 1906.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1907, the United Societies of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the &quot;Eta of Ohio&quot; &#x03a6;&#x0392;&#x039a; chapter on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1909, the school added <a>Sanborn Hall</a>, housing the Music Department.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.
established$$$@@@%%%During the presidency of <a>John W. Hoffman</a> (1916&#x2013;1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a <a>preparatory school</a>, and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.
established$$$@@@%%%Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and <a>sororities</a> were formed.
established$$$@@@%%%Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and <a>Perkins Observatory</a>; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%During <a>the Great Depression</a>, both enrollment and <a>alumni</a> donations shrank.
established$$$@@@%%%While the <a>faculty</a> size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of <a>Edmund D. Soper</a> (1928&#x2013;1938), Acting President <a>Edward Loranus Rice</a> (1938-1939), and <a>Herbert John Burgstahler</a> (1939&#x2013;1949).</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<p>The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.
established$$$@@@%%%Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history.
established$$$@@@%%%The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from <a>New England</a> states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased.
established$$$@@@%%%By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that &quot;in its personnel, its resources, and its students&quot;, Wesleyan lost its &quot;symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new &quot;Centennial Curriculum&quot;, which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.
established$$$@@@%%%Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.
faculty$$$@@@%%%They eventually settled on a new &quot;statement of aims&quot; that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968&#x2013;1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Wesleyan students took over the <a>ROTC</a> building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.
established$$$@@@%%%Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Wesleyan grew in this period.
established$$$@@@%%%Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing &quot;<a>party school</a>&quot; image, leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.
established$$$@@@%%%Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper <em><a>The Transcript</a></em> frequently criticized Wenzlau's  presidency, blaming it for &quot;severely affecting the reputation of the college&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%This exchange resulted in a <em><a>Washington Post</a></em> report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1984&#x2013;today</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The new president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a &quot;live-in&quot; presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.
established$$$@@@%%%Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the <a>ABC</a> and <a>NBC</a> networks.</p>
postgrad$$$@@@%%%<p>More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions.
established$$$@@@%%%A 1986 study, titled &quot;Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges,&quot; identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective &quot;science-active&quot; liberal arts institutions in the nation.

established$$$@@@%%%Approximately 200 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are <a>co-ops</a> united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses.
established$$$@@@%%%The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties.
established$$$@@@%%%Each unit houses a group of 15 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name.
