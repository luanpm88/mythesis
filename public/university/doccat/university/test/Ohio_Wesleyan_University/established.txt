It was founded in 1842 by <a>Methodist</a> leaders and <a>Central Ohio</a> residents as a <a>nonsectarian</a> institution, and is a member of the <a>Ohio Five</a> &#x2014; a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges.
It includes the main <a>academic and residential campus</a>, the <a>Perkins Observatory</a>, and the <a>Kraus Wilderness Preserve</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.</a></p>
<p>In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university &quot;of the highest order&quot; in central Ohio.
To that end, they purchased the <a>Mansion House Hotel</a>, a former health resort with its Sulfur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.
Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing &quot;the <a>democratic</a> spirit of teaching&quot;, which was approved by the <a>Ohio</a> State <a>Legislature</a>.
Early in the following year they opened the <a>college preparatory</a> Academy and formed a <a>Board of Trustees</a>.
Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after <a>John Wesley</a>, founder of <a>Methodism</a>, opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but <a>nonsectarian</a> institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.</p>
<p>Ohio Wesleyan's first president, <a>Edward Thomson</a>, stated in his <a>inaugural address</a> on August 5, 1846 that the school was &quot;a product of the <a>liberality</a> of the local people.&quot;
In the annual celebration for <a>George Washington</a>'s birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick endorsed Ohio Wesleyan's &quot;ideals of democracy&quot; during his oration.</p>
<p>[[Image:ElliottHallOWU.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Elliott Hall, the first college building on campus, was renovated in 2000 and is [[Ohio]]'s oldest collegiate <a>Greek Revival</a> building.]]</p>
<p>During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.
<a>Sturges Hall</a> was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.
In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in <a>Merrick Hall</a>.
The <a>Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a>, established in 1853, merged with Wesleyan in 1877.
Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and <a>music education</a> greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).
Between 1891 and 1895, Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for <a>physics</a>, <a>zoology</a>, <a>geology</a>, <a>speech</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>English</a>, and <a>economics</a>.
<p>In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word &quot;university&quot; in the institution's name.
The <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree was abolished, which left only the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>.
Two students were selected as <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> in 1905 and 1909.
<a>Edwards Gymnasium</a> was built in 1906.
In 1907, the United Societies of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the &quot;Eta of Ohio&quot; &#x03a6;&#x0392;&#x039a; chapter on campus.
In 1909, the school added <a>Sanborn Hall</a>, housing the Music Department.</p>
During the presidency of <a>John W. Hoffman</a> (1916&#x2013;1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a <a>preparatory school</a>, and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.
Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and <a>sororities</a> were formed.
Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and <a>Perkins Observatory</a>; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.</p>
<p><a>250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus.</a>
During <a>the Great Depression</a>, both enrollment and <a>alumni</a> donations shrank.
While the <a>faculty</a> size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of <a>Edmund D. Soper</a> (1928&#x2013;1938), Acting President <a>Edward Loranus Rice</a> (1938-1939), and <a>Herbert John Burgstahler</a> (1939&#x2013;1949).</p>
Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history.
The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from <a>New England</a> states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased.
By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.
In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that &quot;in its personnel, its resources, and its students&quot;, Wesleyan lost its &quot;symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new &quot;Centennial Curriculum&quot;, which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.
Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.
<p>Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968&#x2013;1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Wesleyan students took over the <a>ROTC</a> building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.
Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Wesleyan grew in this period.
Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing &quot;<a>party school</a>&quot; image, leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.
Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper <em><a>The Transcript</a></em> frequently criticized Wenzlau's  presidency, blaming it for &quot;severely affecting the reputation of the college&quot;.
This exchange resulted in a <em><a>Washington Post</a></em> report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.</p>
<p>The new president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a &quot;live-in&quot; presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.
Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the <a>ABC</a> and <a>NBC</a> networks.</p>
A 1986 study, titled &quot;Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges,&quot; identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective &quot;science-active&quot; liberal arts institutions in the nation.
The <a>Battling Bishops</a> won <a>NCAA</a> Division III national championships in men's <a>basketball</a> (1988) and men's (1998) and women's (2001, 2002) <a>soccer</a>.</p>
The new Hamilton Williams Campus Center opened in 1991.
The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship.
The <a>Conrades-Wetherell Science Center</a> opened in 2004 to provide  of additional space for the science departments.
As of 2010, the university is engaged in a fundraising campaign to improve athletics facilities by adding a new turf facility, a new field house and a pool, and a gateway connecting all sports facilities on campus.</p>
<p>Ohio Wesleyan University is accredited by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a>, and is a member of the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>, the <a>Oberlin Group</a>, and the <a>Five Colleges of Ohio</a>, a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges which also includes <a>Kenyon College</a>, <a>Oberlin College</a>, <a>The College of Wooster</a>, and <a>Denison University</a>.
For 2011, Wesleyan accepted approximately 52% of its <a>regular decision</a> applicants, 33% of its transfer applicants, and had a <a>yield rate</a> of 26%.
The middle 50% range of matriculating students for the class of 2010 was 1125&#x2013;1320 for the <a>SAT</a> (old scale) and 24&#x2013;30 for the <a>ACT</a>.
Approximately 35% of accepted applicants were granted internal <a>scholarship</a>s.
The student-faculty ratio is 12.5:1 and faculty members teach all classes.
In 2007, 60% of OWU students favored the <a>Democratic Party</a>.</p>
An index examining gay-friendly policies places OWU among the nation's <a>gay-friendly</a> colleges, and the university enacts policies to meet the six criteria developed by the Campus-Pride organization for recruiting and supporting students from a <a>lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender</a> population.
As measured by percentage of Pell Grant recipients, economic diversity at OWU compares to that of <a>Vassar College</a>, <a>Reed College</a>, <a>Colorado College</a> and <a>Hampshire College</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>faculty</a> consists of 142 <a>tenure</a>d members.
Also as of 2010, women constitute 37% of the tenured professors and earn 93.8% of what male professors earn&#x2014;numbers which suggest favorable gender circumstances.</p>
Upon completing 34 units of coursework, students may earn diplomas in <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a>Bachelor of Fine Arts</a>, or <a>Bachelor of Music</a>.
<p>In its early days, OWU's curriculum began with classical studies, for the course catalogue maintained that &quot;the classical course in Greek and Latin and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit.&quot;
Scientific courses were added to Wesleyan's curriculum in 1849, and since then, <a>scientific</a> subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum.

Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic <a>internationalism</a> since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools.
In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded <a>Kwassui Women's College</a> in <a>Nagasaki</a>, <a>Japan</a>, when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.
Today, Kwasuii College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.
In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to <a>Africa</a> and opened a school in <a>Mutare</a>, <a>Zimbabwe</a>, that eventually became the <a>Africa University</a>.
In March 1988, Conrad Kent established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Wesleyan students.</a>
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually.
Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students.
The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s.
The <a>United Nations</a> flag, along with the flags of more than sixty represented <a>nations</a> and the <a>U.S.</a> flag, flies in University Hall in honor of the ideal of peaceful international relations.</p>
Under a <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a> agreement, OWU established an exchange program with <a>Waseda University</a> in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in <a>Japan</a> and 30 Japanese students to study at Wesleyan each year.
The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988, conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the <a>University of Salamanca</a> in <a>Spain</a>.
The academic collaboration frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the <a>Golden Age</a> in Salamanca.</p>
<p>OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual and media arts (a GLCA arts program), <a>Perkins Observatory</a>, <a>The Strand Theatre</a>, and the <a>Kraus Wilderness Preserve</a>.</p>
The observatory is named after <a>Hiram Perkins</a>, a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college.
When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest <a>telescope</a> in the world, which has since been moved to <a>Arizona</a>.
<p>The university also maintains offices for <a>study abroad</a>, US domestic study, and <a>internship</a> programs.
Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, in research and <a>internship</a> positions.
The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently.
and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in <a>New York City</a>.</p>
The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an <a>experiential learning</a> partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools.
<p>Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of <a>civic engagement</a> and <a>activism</a>.
Progress OWU allows students from Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on <a>politics</a>, <a>public policy</a>, and <a>corporate</a> and <a>social issues</a>, both on campus and in the local community.</p>
The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts.
In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic <a>Strand Theatre</a> in downtown Delaware.</p>
The Delaware Arts Festival is an annual event held the weekend after <a>Mother's Day</a> on the streets of Historic Downtown Delaware.
The Little Brown Jug, a <a>harness race</a>, is run during the Delaware County Fair in September.
The OWU president and the college mascot traditionally award the trophy for the first division of the first heat of the race.</p>
The university offers three <a>chapels</a> as well as several <a>Christian</a> and other religious groups for its students.
Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including <a>chess</a>, <a>ultimate</a>, <a>finance</a>, and medieval sword fighting.
The &quot;Babbling Bishops&quot; started in the fall of 1990 when a group of theatre concentration students formed a performance-oriented project for their theatre degrees.
The project became an <a>improv</a> comedy troupe, rehearsing in <a>Stuyvesant Hall</a> and performing with other college improv <a>troupe</a>s since 1996.</p>
<p>Wesleyan has four religious chaplains: A <a>Protestant</a> minister, a <a>Roman Catholic</a> priest, and a <a>Jewish</a> rabbi.
<em>The OWL</em>, an annual literary publication, features students' work and is one of the nation's oldest college <a>literary magazine</a>s.
Radio station <a>WSLN</a> broadcasts from Slocum Hall and is run by students supervised by the journalism department.</p>
<p> <a>thumb|200px|right|OWU students make a social and artistic statement on the steps of the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center.</a></p>
<p><a>Activism</a> as represented in OWU's founding vision has had a significant role in Wesleyan's history.</p>
<p>The first president, <a>Edward Thomson</a>, staunchly supported the <a>abolition of slavery</a> and <a>liberalism</a>.
Other individuals associated with the university have fought racism.
<a>Branch Rickey</a>, an alumnus, broke the <a>racial barrier</a> in baseball.
Wesleyan's concern intensified with disclosures about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides.</p>
Due to the school's proximity to Columbus, the Ohio state capital, many politically inclined students serve internships for state representatives.
In the 2000s, students have been active on the <a>Iraq war</a>, <a>race</a>, <a>globalization</a>, and women's <a>reproductive rights</a>.</p>
All events were held at the <a>Monnett Campus</a>, where female students danced around the <a>Maypole</a>, while men were barred.
The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.</p>
<p>In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first <em>Mock Convention</em>, which has recurred in every <a>presidential election</a> year since 1920.
Its purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents about the <a>presidential nominating convention</a>, presidential <a>candidates</a>, and key issues in the upcoming <a>election</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear &quot;dinks&quot;, red caps with black brims and a black W on the front.
Disobedient students who refused to wear the &quot;dink&quot; were tossed into the <em>Sulphur Spring</em> (see later reference).
The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester.
<p>Ohio Wesleyan's <a>Homecoming</a> takes place in early October, while the Wesleyan <a>football</a> team plays one of its traditional rivals.
<p>The <em>President's Ball</em>, a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first Saturday of December.
Other traditions include <em>OWU vs. Denison</em>, which stages a &quot;fierce&quot; athletic rivalry between Wesleyan and <a>Denison University</a>; the <em> Sagan Colloquium</em>, spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an issue of concern&lt;!-- and that is...? --&gt; to the <a>liberal arts</a>; and <em>Orchesis</em>, an annual celebration of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year.
&quot;Fresh-X&quot; is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates.</p>
Springfest, the second musical event, proceeds in mid-April and in recent years has featured well-known music groups such as <a>Counting Crows</a>, <a>The Roots</a>, <a>Guster</a>, <a>Ben Folds</a>, and most recently, <a>Gym Class Heroes</a>.
<p>A rock next to Hayes Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and students continually repaint it with <a>graffiti</a> and <a>slogans</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.</a>
The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus.</p>
Welch Hall is designated as a &quot;quiet&quot; dorm for honors students.
<a>250px|thumb|left|Students converse on the back porch of The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.</a>
Approximately 200 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are <a>co-ops</a> united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses.
The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties.
Each unit houses a group of 15 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name.
As of the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year, the SLUs consist of The <a>Peace</a> and <a>Justice</a> House, The <a>International</a> House, The House of <a>Black</a> Culture, The Creative <a>Arts</a> House, The <a>Women</a>'s House, The Modern Foreign <a>Language</a> House, The House of Thought, The <a>Tree</a> House, and The Interfaith House.
The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies.
They have a House Moderator who undergoes the same training as a Resident Advisor.
At the end of each academic year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year.
The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis.</p>
Known as the <em>Battling Bishops</em>, Wesleyan competes in 21 sports.
In the late 1880s, Ohio Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of Ohio behind the pitching of <a>Phil &quot;Lefty&quot; Saylor</a>.
The school joined the <a>Ohio Athletic Conference</a> along with <a>Oberlin College</a>, <a>Kenyon College</a>, <a>Ohio State</a>, and <a>Case Western</a> in 1902.
The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the athletic one.</p>
<p>Ohio Wesleyan has won several NCAA Division III titles in different sports, including men's basketball (<a>1988</a>), men's soccer (<a>1998</a>), and women's soccer (<a>2001</a> and <a>2002</a>).
The <a>soccer</a> team has won the NCAC championship three times, last in 2002.
Due to its <a>ironic</a> name, the Wesleyan mascot has been listed as one of the weirdest college mascots.
In 2005, attention was directed to the religious insensitivity of the historically based name.</pre>
<p><a>250px|left|thumb|The men's lacrosse team at Selby Field.</a>
The men's lacrosse team has a historic rivalry with <a>Denison University</a>, the soccer team with <a>Kenyon College</a>, and the <a>field hockey</a> team with <a>Oberlin College</a>.
<p>&quot;<strong>Oh we're from dear old Wesleyan</strong>&quot; is Ohio Wesleyan University's primary <a>fight song</a>.
The song's lyrics were written in 1914 by Chass Cupett '1916.
<p>Under the charter granted by the State of Ohio, the Board of Trustees possesses the legal authority to operate the college.
The charter and bylaws stipulate a board of 34 trustees, of whom one is the president.
Since Wesleyan's beginnings, sixteen people have held the title of <a>president</a>, and a few have served as interim president.
<p>After several disagreements between Huddleston and the Wesleyan administration, Huddleston accepted a position as president of the <a>University of New Hampshire</a> and left Wesleyan on June 30, 2007, giving him the second shortest presidential reign in Wesleyan's history, behind David Lockmiller, 1959&#x2013;1961.
<p>On 17 December, 2007, Dr. Rockwell &quot;Rock&quot; Jones was elected to serve as the 16th president of Ohio Wesleyan University.
For the 2005&#x2013;2006 fiscal year, Ohio Wesleyan's alumni giving rate was 35%.
<p>In academia, <a>Frank Sherwood Rowland</a> (class of 1948) won the 1995 <a>Nobel Prize</a> for <a>chemistry</a> for his research on the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer.
<a>Ezra Vogel</a> (1950) is a prominent author on <a>China-Japan issues</a> and was the director of <a>Harvard's</a> Fairbank Center for East Asian Research from 1995 to 1999.
<a>Arthur Flemming</a> (1927) was a Secretary of <a>Health, Education and Welfare</a>, was known for his commitment to <a>civil rights</a>, and was the recipient of two Presidential Medals of Freedom.
<a>Lucy Webb Hayes</a> (1853), wife of U.S. President <a>Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, was the first woman to be called <a>First Lady</a>, and the first First Lady to hold a college degree.</p>
<p>Notable journalists and media personalities include <a>Frank Stanton</a> (1930), a president of <a>CBS</a> known for supporting broadcast journalism before Congress; <a>Byron Pitts</a> (1982), a national correspondent for <a>CBS News</a>; <a>Wendie Malick</a> (1972), an <a>Emmy</a>-nominated actress known for her role on the NBC sitcom <em><a>Just Shoot Me!</a></em>; <a>Melvin Van Peebles</a> (1953), an actor, director, screenwriter, playwright, and composer; <a>Patricia Wettig</a> (1974), the actress who plays vice president Caroline Richards on <em><a>Prison Break</a></em>; and <a>Clark Gregg</a> (1984), the actor playing Richard in <em>The New Adventures of Old Christine</em> with <a>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>.</p>
<a>Branch Rickey</a> (1904) was a baseball manager and executive known for signing <a>Jackie Robinson</a> as the first African-American in <a>Major League Baseball</a>.
Another graduate, Mary King (1962), worked alongside the Reverend Dr. <a>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in the U.S. <a>civil rights movement</a> when she was a young student, and was a member of the staff of the <a>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC).
Rev. <a>Norman Vincent Peale</a> (1920) was the author of <em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em> and the winner of a <a>Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> for his theological contributions.
Others found fame in other forms: <a>Mildred Elizabeth Sisk</a> (aka Axis Sally) was the first American woman to be tried and sentenced for <a>treason</a>, convicted of <a>broadcasting</a> for <a>Nazi Germany</a> during <a>World War II</a>.
After serving a 12-year sentence, Sisk returned to OWU, where she received a bachelor's degree in speech in 1973.</p>
