<p><a>left|250px|thumb|The University of Winnipeg</a> The U of W's founding colleges were <a>Manitoba College</a> and <a>Wesley College</a>, which merged to form <a>United College</a> in 1938.
The University of Winnipeg was established in 1967 when United College received its charter.
United College was formed in 1938 from the union of Manitoba College, founded in 1871, Yellow College in 1875 and Wesley College, founded in 1888.
Originally affiliated with the <a>University of Manitoba</a>, United College received its charter in 1967 and became the University of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>As a university in the downtown of a large urban centre, the University of Winnipeg is playing a role in the downtown renewal.

<p>In 2008, the university announced that Raymond L. McFeetors, Chairman of <a>The Great West Life Assurance Company</a>, had donated $2.67 Million for a dormitory to be built on newly acquired property west of the campus.
The money came from his personal resources and from Great West Life.

<p>The University of Winnipeg&#x2019;s Great Rock Climb celebrates endurance and ingenuity.
Teams of three students, faculty, staff, or alumni raced down the 50.3 metres from the steps of Wesley Hall to the top of the Great Rock in a test of physical stamina and defiance of earthly gravity.</p>
<p>The all-time record was set in 1979 by the Collegiate team when the trio reached the top in 9.8 seconds.
Renovations during the summer of 2007 have significantly slowed the event, with a new record set in 2007 by The Caravaners, consisting of members Ian Scott, Drew Hawranik, and Alex Edye.
2008 and 2009 were repeat performances by The Caravaners, who become the only trio to win the competition in three consecutive years.
They recorded a time of 15.19 seconds which becomes the current record for the event with a renovated front lawn.
<p>After flying in from Edmonton to battle in the Great Rock Climb, Drew Hawranik had to return to Alberta without competing due to rain on September 10, 2010.
