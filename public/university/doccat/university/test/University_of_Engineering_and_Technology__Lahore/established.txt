The <a>vice-chancellor</a> is the executive head and manages university functions.
In 2010, UET Lahore was ranked the 281st <a>engineering</a> and <a>technology</a> university in the world by QS World University Rankings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>UET was established in 1921 as the Mughalpura Technical College.
Its more familiar name of the pre-University era, the Maclagan Engineering College, was adopted in 1923 when Sir <a>Edward Maclagan</a>, the Governor of the Punjab, laid the foundation stone of the building, now called the Main Block.</p>
<p>In 1932 the institution became affiliated with the University of the Punjab for award of a <a>bachelor's degree</a> in Engineering.
At the time of the partition of British India, in 1947, it had well-established <a>Bachelor of Science</a> courses in electrical, mechanical and civil engineering, and the quality of its scholastic standards had won it a place of prestige throughout British India.</p>
Expansion and development commenced in 1961, upon its transformation into the West Pakistan University of Engineering &amp; Technology.
The first priority was to start teaching of those disciplines which were crucial for national development but were not catered for by any institution in the country.
Accordingly, in the 1960s, bachelor's degree courses were started in Chemical Engineering, Petroleum &amp; Gas Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Architecture and City &amp; Regional Planning.</p>
<p>Later, the University concentrated its energies and resources on developing its postgraduate programs.
By the 1970s it had established over a score of <a>master's degree</a> courses in diverse specializations of engineering, architecture, planning and allied disciplines.
<a>PhD</a> degree programs were also instituted in a number of disciplines.
Presently, the institute offers a diverse range of programs in different disciplines of engineering under the supervision of its six faculties.</p>
<p>In 2010, UET Lahore was ranked the 281st engineering and technology university in the world by QS World University Rankings.</p>
With this end in view, the university has established a Directorate of Research, Extension and Advisory Services which strives for the promotion and organization of research activities.
The Al-Khwarizmi Institute of Computer Sciences is also a notable name in ongoing research activity in computer sciences in Pakistan.</p>
The university has a large sports complex, consisting of a swimming pool, tennis court, table tennis court, squash court and a cricket stadium that is also used for athletics.
UETians often come out as winners in co/extracurricular competitions held throughout the leading educational institutes.
