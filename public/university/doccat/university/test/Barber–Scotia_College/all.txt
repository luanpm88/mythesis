established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Scotia Seminary</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Barber-Scotia began as a female <a>seminary</a> in 1867.
established$$$@@@%%%Scotia Seminary was founded by the Reverend Luke Dorland and chartered in 1870.
established$$$@@@%%%This was a project by the <a>Presbyterian Church</a> to prepare young <a>African American</a> <a>southern</a> women (the daughters of former <a>slaves</a>) for careers as <a>social work</a>ers and teachers.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the coordinate women's school for Biddle University (now <a>Johnson C. Smith University</a>).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was the first <a>historically black female institution of higher education</a> established after the <a>American Civil War</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<em><a>The Charlotte Observer</a></em>, in an interview with Janet Magaldi, president of Piedmont Preservation Foundation, stated, &quot;Scotia Seminary was one of the first black institutions built after the Civil War.
free$$$@@@%%%For the first time, it gave black women an alternative to becoming domestic servants or field hands.&quot;
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Scotia Seminary was modeled after Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now <a>Mount Holyoke College</a>) and was referred to as <em>The Mount Holyoke of the South.</em>
established$$$@@@%%%The seminary offered grammar, science, and domestic arts.
students$$$@@@%%%In 1908 it had 19 teachers and 291 students.
established$$$@@@%%%From its founding in 1867 to 1908 it had enrolled 2,900 students, with 604 having graduated from the grammar department and 109 from the normal department.
former_names$$$@@@%%%This merger created Barber-Scotia Junior College for women.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school granted its first bachelor's degree in 1945, and became a four-year <a>women's college</a> in 1946.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1954, Barber&#x2013;Scotia College became a <a>coeducational</a> institution and received accreditation from the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Today, the college maintains close ties to the <a>Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>
city$$$@@@%%%<h3>2004-2008</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On June 24, 2004, one week after appointing its new president, Dr. Gloria Bromell Tinubu, the college learned that it had lost its <a>accreditation</a> which meant that students became ineligible for federal aid (an estimated 90% of the school's students depended on federally funded aid) and that many employees would be laid off.
established$$$@@@%%%It lost its accreditation due to what the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> said was a failure to comply with SACS Principles and Philosophy of Accreditation (Integrity), as the school &quot;awarded degrees to nearly 30 students in the adult program who SACS determined hadn&#x2019;t fulfilled the proper requirements&quot;   </p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During her tenure President Gloria Bromell-Tinubu led a strategic planning effort to change the college from a four-year liberal arts program to a college of entrepreneurship and business, and established partnerships with accredited colleges and top-tiered universities.
established$$$@@@%%%In February 2006 a committee of the General Assembly Council of the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a> voted to continue the denomination's financial support for Barber-Scotia, noting that its physical facilities were &quot;substantial and well-secured&quot; and that the school was undertaking serious planning for the future.
established$$$@@@%%%In May 2006, it was reported that Barber-Scotia would rent space on its campus to <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Augustine's College</a> to use for an adult-education program: &quot;Under the terms of the deal, St. Augustine's will pay Barber-Scotia for the space for its Gateway degree program starting this fall.&quot;
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>McLean was replaced by President Carl M. Flamer (an alumnus of the college) who accepted the position without payment and the college re-opened with a limited number of students.
established$$$@@@%%%During this time, the &quot;previous attempts to revive the college [which] have centered on an entrepreneurial or business curriculum&quot; were formally abandoned &quot;in favor of focusing more on religious studies.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Flamer also worked to eliminate debt and worked with alumni and the community to save the college.</em></p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<h2>2009</h2>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Barber-Scotia currently has an enrollment of 20 full time students.
established$$$@@@%%%It has submitted its application for accreditation and after a successful accreditation site visit during April 2009 has begun its Institutional Self-Study process.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Documentation will be submitted to the national accrediting body for review.
students$$$@@@%%%During January 2010 a site visit team will arrive on campus for review of documentation, staff and policies.
established$$$@@@%%%It is the College's hope that it will be presented to the full commission for candidacy (provisional accreditaion) during April 2010.</p>
