<h2>History</h2>
<p>Barber-Scotia began as a female <a>seminary</a> in 1867.
Scotia Seminary was founded by the Reverend Luke Dorland and chartered in 1870.
This was a project by the <a>Presbyterian Church</a> to prepare young <a>African American</a> <a>southern</a> women (the daughters of former <a>slaves</a>) for careers as <a>social work</a>ers and teachers.
It was the coordinate women's school for Biddle University (now <a>Johnson C. Smith University</a>).
<p>It was the first <a>historically black female institution of higher education</a> established after the <a>American Civil War</a>.
<em><a>The Charlotte Observer</a></em>, in an interview with Janet Magaldi, president of Piedmont Preservation Foundation, stated, &quot;Scotia Seminary was one of the first black institutions built after the Civil War.
<p>Scotia Seminary was modeled after Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now <a>Mount Holyoke College</a>) and was referred to as <em>The Mount Holyoke of the South.</em>
The seminary offered grammar, science, and domestic arts.
From its founding in 1867 to 1908 it had enrolled 2,900 students, with 604 having graduated from the grammar department and 109 from the normal department.
<p>The school granted its first bachelor's degree in 1945, and became a four-year <a>women's college</a> in 1946.
In 1954, Barber&#x2013;Scotia College became a <a>coeducational</a> institution and received accreditation from the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
Today, the college maintains close ties to the <a>Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2004, one week after appointing its new president, Dr. Gloria Bromell Tinubu, the college learned that it had lost its <a>accreditation</a> which meant that students became ineligible for federal aid (an estimated 90% of the school's students depended on federally funded aid) and that many employees would be laid off.
It lost its accreditation due to what the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> said was a failure to comply with SACS Principles and Philosophy of Accreditation (Integrity), as the school &quot;awarded degrees to nearly 30 students in the adult program who SACS determined hadn&#x2019;t fulfilled the proper requirements&quot;   </p>
<p>During her tenure President Gloria Bromell-Tinubu led a strategic planning effort to change the college from a four-year liberal arts program to a college of entrepreneurship and business, and established partnerships with accredited colleges and top-tiered universities.
In February 2006 a committee of the General Assembly Council of the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a> voted to continue the denomination's financial support for Barber-Scotia, noting that its physical facilities were &quot;substantial and well-secured&quot; and that the school was undertaking serious planning for the future.
In May 2006, it was reported that Barber-Scotia would rent space on its campus to <a>St.
Augustine's College</a> to use for an adult-education program: &quot;Under the terms of the deal, St. Augustine's will pay Barber-Scotia for the space for its Gateway degree program starting this fall.&quot;
<p>McLean was replaced by President Carl M. Flamer (an alumnus of the college) who accepted the position without payment and the college re-opened with a limited number of students.
During this time, the &quot;previous attempts to revive the college [which] have centered on an entrepreneurial or business curriculum&quot; were formally abandoned &quot;in favor of focusing more on religious studies.&quot;
Flamer also worked to eliminate debt and worked with alumni and the community to save the college.</em></p>
It has submitted its application for accreditation and after a successful accreditation site visit during April 2009 has begun its Institutional Self-Study process.
It is the College's hope that it will be presented to the full commission for candidacy (provisional accreditaion) during April 2010.</p>
<p>The college currently offers the following two degree programs: bachelors of arts in religious studies and a bachelors of science in bio-energy.
<p>One of Scotia Seminary's most notable alumnae was <a>Mary McLeod Bethune</a>, advisor to President <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>., who also started a school for black students in <a>Daytona Beach, Florida</a> that eventually became <a>Bethune-Cookman University</a>.</p>
<p>Also Dr. Katie G. Cannon, the first African-American female ordained as minister by the Presbyterian Church is a graduate of the college.</p>
<p>The <em><a>New York Times</a></em> noted that the mother of novelist <a>Chester Himes</a> &quot;taught at the elite Scotia Seminary in North Carolina before her marriage.&quot;</p>
