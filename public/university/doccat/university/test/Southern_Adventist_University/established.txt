<h2>History</h2>
<p>Southern's roots stem from the establishment of Graysville Academy in Graysville, Tennessee, in 1892.
The school moved to the community of Thatcher's Switch in 1916, renaming it &quot;Collegedale&quot;.
In 1942, Kenneth A. Wright became president of the school.
During Wright's administration, &quot;Southern Junior College&quot; became accredited as a four-year institution.
A new name, &quot;Southern Missionary College&quot;, was adopted in 1944.
Two men and four women received Southern's first baccalaureate degrees two years later.
Renamed &quot;Southern College of Seventh-day Adventists&quot; in 1982, the school became a <a>university</a> in 1996.
