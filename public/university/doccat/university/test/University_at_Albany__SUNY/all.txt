established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|300px|View of the New York State Normal College on Western Avenue in 1909</a> Although the university is the oldest SUNY component, it was an independent teachers' college for most of its history until SUNY was formed in 1948.
established$$$@@@%%%The University at Albany began as the <strong>New York State Normal School</strong> on May 7, 1844, by vote of the State Legislature.
established$$$@@@%%%Beginning with 29 students and four faculty in an abandoned railroad depot on State Street in the heart of the city, the Normal School was the first New York State-chartered institution of higher education.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Dedicated to training New York students as schoolteachers and administrators, by the early 1890s the &#x201c;School&#x201d; had become the New York State Normal College and, with a revised four-year curriculum in 1905, became the first public institution of higher education in New York to be granted the power to confer the bachelor's degree.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A new campus &#x2014; today, UAlbany&#x2019;s Downtown Campus &#x2014; was established in 1909 on a site of  between Washington and Western avenues.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1913, the institution was home to 590 students and 44 faculty members, it offered a master&#x2019;s degree for the first time, and bore a new name &#x2014; the New York State College for Teachers.
established$$$@@@%%%Enrollments grew to a peak of 1,424 in 1932.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1948 the <a>State University of New York</a> system was created, comprising the College for Teachers and several other institutions throughout the state.
established$$$@@@%%%SUNY, including its University at Albany, ultimately became a manifestation of the grand vision of Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, who wanted a public university system to accommodate the college students of the post-World War II baby boom.
faculty$$$@@@%%%To do so, he launched a massive construction program that developed over 50 new campuses.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1957 the University at Albany, State University of New York was officially designated a doctoral-degree granting university center of SUNY.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The same year, Rockefeller broke ground for the current Uptown Campus on the former site of the Albany Country Club.
established$$$@@@%%%The new campus's first dormitory opened in October 1958, and the first classes on the academic podium in the Fall of 1962.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1970, a year beyond the University&#x2019;s 125th anniversary, enrollment had grown to 13,200 and the faculty to 746.
established$$$@@@%%%The Uptown Campus, designed by architect <a>Edward Durell Stone</a>, accommodated this growth and gave visible evidence of the schools transition from a teachers college to a broad <a>liberal arts</a> university.
type$$$@@@%%%The Downtown Campus became dedicated to the fields of public policy: criminal justice, public affairs, information science and social welfare.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1985, the University added the School of Public Health, a unique joint endeavor with the state&#x2019;s <a>Department of Health</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1983, the <a>New York State Writers Institute</a> was founded by <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning author <a>William Kennedy</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1990s, the university built a $3 billion,  Albany NanoTech complex, extending the Uptown Campus westward.
established$$$@@@%%%By 2006, it became home to the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1996, a third campus &#x2014; the East Campus &#x2014; was added  east of the Uptown Campus in <a>Rensselaer County</a>, when the University acquired former Sterling-Winthrop laboratories and converted them into labs, classrooms, and a business incubator concentrating on advances in biotechnology and other health-related disciplines.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2005, the East Campus became home to the University&#x2019;s Gen*NY*Sis Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics.
established$$$@@@%%%Growth occurred on the Uptown Campus in the fall of 2004, when a new Life Sciences Building opened, dedicated to basic research and education.
established$$$@@@%%%In the spring of 2005, the university created the first-of-its-kind College of Computing and Information, with a stated goal of preparing students for the information technology-centric world of the 21st Century.</p>
