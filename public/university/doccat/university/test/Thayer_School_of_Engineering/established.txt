<p> <strong>Thayer School of Engineering</strong> is a <a>graduate school</a> at <a>Dartmouth College</a>, <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, United States, whose faculty also double as the undergraduate Department of <a>Engineering Sciences</a>.
The school was established in 1867 with funds from Brig.
Gen. <a>Sylvanus Thayer</a>, known for his work in establishing an engineering curriculum at the <a>United States Military Academy</a> at <a>West Point, New York</a>.
Located in a two-building complex along the <a>Connecticut River</a> on the Dartmouth campus, the Thayer School today offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as dual-degree programs with other local institutions.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thayer School is named for <a>Sylvanus Thayer</a>, a Dartmouth alumnus from the class of 1807.
Thayer was known as &quot;the father of West Point&quot; for his sixteen-year superintendency at the <a>United States Military Academy</a>, where he developed an extensive engineering curriculum unlike any other in the United States at the time.
After thirty years of professional service in the <a>Army Corps of Engineers</a>, Thayer endowed $70,000 to Dartmouth College in 1867 for the establishment of a school of engineering, initially called the Thayer School of Civil Engineering.]]
The school opened four years later in 1871 with six students.
The curriculum borrowed heavily from the model developed by Thayer at West Point; graduates of the two-year program were awarded a degree in <a>civil engineering</a> (C.E.).
Robert Fletcher, the first director and dean of the school, was also its only instructor for several years.
The Thayer School is located on the campus of <a>Dartmouth College</a>, which is situated in the rural, <a>Upper Valley</a> <a>New England</a> town of <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>.
The campus of the Thayer School sits in a complex on the west side Dartmouth's campus near the <a>Connecticut River</a>.
When classes first began in 1871, Sylvanus Thayer's endowment had not provided for a physical plant.
Consequently, the school was an itinerant institution for many years, occupying parts of various College buildings and, at one point, a former structure of the <a>New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts</a>.</p>
$200,000 were spent to build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer's only facility for nearly 70&nbsp;years.
In 2004, construction began on the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006.

<p>The Thayer School serves as both <a>Dartmouth College</a>'s undergraduate department of engineering, as well as a graduate school offering advanced degrees.
Undergraduate <a>majors</a> can receive their <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in engineering at the school, and may choose to continue on to earn a <a>Bachelor of Engineering</a> (B.E.) degree in an additional year or less.
Thayer also offers a dual-degree program for undergraduates at other colleges who wish to earn their Bachelor's degree at their home institution and their B.E. at Thayer.
<p>Thayer offers several <a>graduate degree</a> programs, including a <a>Master of Science</a> (M.S.) and <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D) in engineering.
The school also offers a <a>Master of Engineering Management</a> (M.E.M.) degree in conjunction with the adjacent <a>Tuck School of Business</a>, and a combination Ph.D/<a>Doctor of Medicine</a> (M.D.) from <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>.</p>
<p>The Thayer School emphasizes the cross-disciplinary nature of its research topics.

The Thayer School promotes its connections to engineering <a>entrepreneurship</a>.
The Cook Engineering Design Center, founded in 1978, acts to solicit industry-sponsored projects for degree candidates to work on.
Companies and products that have emerged from the Thayer School include emeritus professor Robert Dean's <a>Creare, Inc.</a> and Dartmouth music professor <a>Jon Appleton</a>'s work on the <a>Synclavier</a> synthesizer.
The school maintains a list of <a>startup companies</a> established by its current faculty.</p>
It was also included in <em><a>BusinessWeek</a><strong>s unranked list of 60 &quot;Best Design Schools in the World&quot;.</em></p>
Average <a>Graduate Record Examination</a> (GRE) test scores of applicants in verbal, quantitative, and analytical sections were 601, 778, and 695, respectively.</p>

Notable former faculty include <a>Arthur Kantrowitz</a>, <a>emeritus</a> professor of engineering, and <a>Myron Tribus</a>, the dean of the Thayer School for most of the 1960s.</p>
