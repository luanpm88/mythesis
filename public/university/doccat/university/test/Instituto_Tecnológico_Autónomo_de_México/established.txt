<p>  The <strong>Instituto Tecnol&#x00f3;gico Aut&#x00f3;nomo de M&#x00e9;xico</strong> (in <a>English</a>: Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology), commonly known as <strong>ITAM</strong>, is a private <a>Ph.D.</a>-granting <a>research university</a> located in <a>Mexico City</a>, <a>Mexico</a>.
It is one of the nation's preeminent institutions of higher learning, the best private university in Mexico according to <em><a>El Universal</a></em>; the best undergraduate Accounting, Business, International Relations and Economics school in Mexico City according to <em><a>Reforma</a></em>; and the best <a>Business School</a> in <a>Latin America</a> according to <em><a>America Economia</a></em> (2010).
<h2>History</h2>
<p>ITAM was founded as the <em>Instituto Tecnol&#x00f3;gico de M&#x00e9;xico (ITM)</em>, on March 29, 1946 under the aegis of the Mexican Association of Culture (<em>Asociaci&#x00f3;n Mexicana de Cultura</em>).
A group of wealthy individuals with interests in banking, industry and commerce, led by Don <a>Ra&#x00fa;l Baill&#x00e8;res</a>, created the institution with the goal of using higher education as a promoter of economic and industrial change in Mexico.</p>
<p>It was originally an <a>Economics School</a> and one year later it opened its undergraduate <a>Business School</a>.
Due to the opening of the <a>Accounting School</a>, the institute grew from 52 students in 1947 to 500 in 1951.
In 1963, by government decree, the ITAM was recognized as a &#x201c;Free University School&#x201d; and became autonomous (hence its name).
However the inclusion of the word autonomous in its name was not recognized by the government until 1985.</p>
<p>During the 1970&#x2019;s new programs were added including <a>Applied Mathematics</a> (1974), <a>Social Science</a> (1975) and a <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (1974).
In the 80&#x2019;s and 90&#x2019;s the additions were: <a>Law</a> (1980), <a>Actuarial Science</a>(1982), <a>Computer Science</a> (1983), <a>Political Science</a> (1991, instead of Social Science), <a>International Relations</a> (1992), <a>Telematics</a> (1993) and <a>Industrial Engineering</a> (1997).
During the last decade the academic offer was increased by the establishment of <a>Business Engineering</a> (2004), <a>Financial Management</a> and <a>Mechatronics</a> (2010).</p>
<p>During its first four years the ITAM was originally located in a house in <a>Mexico City</a>'s <em><a>centro</a></em> in 518 La Palma street.
In 1950 the institute moved to 65 Serapio Rend&#x00f3;n street in the Colonia San Rafael.
During the late 50&#x2019;s it moved once more to a new building built specially for the institute at the corner of Marina Nacional street and Lago Zirahuen street in the Colonia An&#x00e1;huac.
In 1991 the smaller graduate school campus, in 939 Camino Santa Teresa, was opened.</p>
<p>During its 60 years ITAM has had eight <a>rector</a>s:</p>
<p>The ITAM, through this department, offers an education in modern economics, with a considerable emphasis on analytic techniques and economic models, in line with the subjects being taught in economics department around the world.
The Department of Economics has been especially influential.
The department is ranked as the best Economics school in Mexico, depending on the survey, and one of the Top 75 Economics departments globally.
<p>Because of the economics leading career, the Department of Political Science was invited to be the leading faculty in the field since the middle eighties.
With the formal change of the career in 1991, the program was adapted to the modern American political science and incorpored important tools like mathematics, economics and statistics.
The program has a tremendous success, being the principal school in the subject, because of the number of students and all full-time faculty did doctoral studies in world's leading universities like <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Duke</a>, <a>Chicago</a>, <a>Michigan</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>UCSD</a>, and <a>Yale</a>.

<p>The Department of Mathematics at ITAM consists of full time researchers with graduate degrees who follow active research lines and publish in internationally renowned journals.
The department has also participated in the global mathematics community by hosting several international applied mathematics conferences over the years.
Its main strengths lie in numerical analysis, financial mathematics, <a>stochastic processes</a>, real analysis and dynamic systems applied to the social sciences.
Both BSc programs it maintains have been hugely successful in providing high level technical skills to its students, which often obtain graduate degrees abroad in Math, Finance, Economics, Statistics and Operations Research.</p>
<p>The Department of International Studies is one of the main research centers of diplomatic studies in Mexico and Latin America.
It also coordinates the Institute of European Integration Studies (IEIE) and the Inter-American Studies Center (CEPI).
<p>Despite being known for as a technocratic education center, ITAM has maintained a large group of faculty devoted to the study of Philosophy, History, Religion and Society in its Department of General Studies.
This department provides the bulk of the teaching for the core courses at ITAM: History, Philosophy and Problems of the Current Society.
This department edits a journal by the name of <em>Estudios</em> which contains mostly essays by Mexican philosophers and historians.</p>
In 2005 ITAM Business School became the first in Mexico to hold simultaneous accreditation of its programs by the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)</a> of the United States, the <a>Association of MBAs</a> of the United Kingdom and the <a>European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS)</a>.</p>
