<strong>;</strong> English: <em>National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science</em>) is one of the leading European research centers in the field of mathematics and theoretical <a>computer science</a>.
It is located at the <a>Science Park Amsterdam</a> in the <a>Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p>The institute was founded in 1946 by <a>Johannes van der Corput</a>, <a>David van Dantzig</a>, <a>Jurjen Koksma</a>, <a>Hendrik Anthony Kramers</a>, <a>Marcel Minnaert</a> and <a>Jan Arnoldus Schouten</a>.
It was originally called <em>Mathematical Centre</em> (in Dutch: <em>Mathematisch Centrum</em>).
<a>Adriaan van Wijngaarden</a>, considered the founder of computer science (or <em>informatica</em>) in the Netherlands, was the director of the institute for almost 20 years.
In 1983, the name of the institute was changed to CWI to reflect the strong computer science component in its research.</p>
<p>Today, the institute is internationally known for its work in fields such as operations research (in which CWI has a long tradition), software engineering, information processing, and mathematical applications in life sciences and logistics.
More recent examples of research results from CWI include the development of scheduling algorithms for the Dutch railway system, the <a>Nederlandse Spoorwegen</a> (one of the busiest rail networks in the world), or the development of the <a>Python programming language</a> by <a>Guido van Rossum</a>.
Python has played an important role in the development of <a>Google search platform</a> from the beginning, and it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves .
Also, many of the information retrieval solutions used by packages such as <a>SPSS</a> were initially developed by Data Distilleries, a spinoff of CWI.</p>
Most of its senior researchers hold part-time professorships at other Dutch universities, with the institute producing over 170 full professors during the course of its history.
Several CWI researchers have been recognized as members of the <a>Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a>Academia Europaea</a>, or as knights in the <a>Order of the Netherlands Lion</a>.
<p>CWI is one of the &quot;birthplaces&quot; of the Internet in Europe.
The first connection in Europe to the <a>NSFnet</a> network, which later developed into the current <a>Internet</a>, was established at CWI on 17 November 1988 by Piet Beertema.
