At the heart of this commitment is Field Period, where students spend 140 hours per year in a self-directed learning experience.
Through Field Period, each Keuka student is required to spend 140 hours per year (or approximately one month) in a self-directed learning experience.
This can involve a work <a>internship</a>, a <a>community service</a> project, spiritual exploration, personal development (such as an <a>Outward Bound</a> experience), cross-cultural diversity exploration, or a group cultural experience to another city or country.</p>
