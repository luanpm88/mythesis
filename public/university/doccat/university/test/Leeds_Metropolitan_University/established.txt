This is the first partnership of this kind between the governing body of a sport in England and a university</li>
<li>In May of the same year, the University purchased a 51% stake in the <a>Leeds Tykes</a> <a>rugby union</a> club.
The name of the club was changed to Leeds Carnegie to fit with Carnegie College The University has now divested itself of that stake </li>

<p>Simon Lee embarked on a controversial programme of partnerships with external bodies during his time as vice-chancellor, which came to be dubbed as &quot;rubbing shoulders&quot; after the university took a majority stake in the <a>Leeds Tykes</a> rugby club, renaming it <a>Leeds Carnegie</a>.
It was later revealed that the club signed <a>Waisale Serevi</a> after he had already been paid for other work at the university.

<p>In 2009, the then vice-chancellor <a>Simon Lee</a> resigned from his position following a series of controversies including ongoing arguments over the university's fees strategy, allegations of bullying and foreign travel for his wife paid for by the university.
The chancellor of the university, <a>Brendan Foster</a>, also resigned less than a month later.
