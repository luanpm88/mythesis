<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|University (Main) Hall circa 1900</a> A university for the state of Montana was made possible because of an act of Congress February 18, 1881 that dedicated 72 sections (46,000 acres) for its creation.
Once statehood was attained by the establishment law, the Montana state legislature went about deciding the location of its university as well as a permanent capital.
To assure acquisition of the state university, the city of Missoula made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over the leading competitor Anaconda; supported by <a>Copper Kings</a> <a>William A. Clark</a> and <a>Marcus Daly</a> respectively.
Missoula won the legislative vote at the Third Legislative Assembly for the State of Montana February 1893.
The University was formally opened in 1895.</p>
<p>While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were temporarily held at nearby Willard School.
Hammond</a>, Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus.
In June 1898 the cornerstone for A.J. Gibson designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became &#x201c;the University City.</p>
<p><a>thumb|University of Montana circa 1900</a></p>
<p>The original plan of the University campus was designed in 1895 by one of its first professors, Frederich Scheuch, who called for the central oval to be surrounded by immediate and future University buildings.
Although Scheuch's plan called for all building entrances to face the center of the Oval, forming a radiating building pattern.
All building under this plan were designed as three-story, Renaissance Revival buildings with hipped roofs and Spanish green roof tiles.</p>
<p> After the <strong>University of Montana</strong> was founded in 1893 classes were temporarily held in the old Willard School until the first set of buildings were set up around the oval in 1895.
Today the campus consists of 156 acres and is bordered to the east by <a>Mount Sentinel</a> and the north by the <a>Clark Fork River</a>.
<p><a>thumb|The University of Montana campus</a> <strong>The Oval</strong></p>
<p>The Oval is a three-acre swath of grass (length east to west) that marks that traditional center of the university.
Today it is divided into quadrants by two intersecting brick-laid paths, though originally the oval was solid grass and forbidden to be crossed by students.</p>
<p>A double row of trees was planted around the oval on Arbor Day 1896, but many of the trees have since died and are in the process of being replanted.
The original gravel driveway that once surrounded the Oval has also been replaced by sidewalk.</p>
<p>The original master plan of the university called for all buildings to face the center of the oval, but this plan proved difficult and an a new plan was created in 1935.</p>
<p>The western extreme of the Oval boasts the most iconic sculpture on campus, that of a grizzly bear.
Many photographs of the university picture the bear with the Oval, University (Main) Hall, and <a>Mt.
Sentinel</a>'s 'M' in the background.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Grizzly statue with University (Main) Hall and &quot;M&quot; Trail in the distance.</a>
<p>The 'M' is a 3/4 mile long trail with 13 switchbacks that rises 620 feet (from 3,200 feet to 3,820) from the University of Montana at the base of <a>Mt.
<p>There is debate of when The 'M' was first placed on <a>Mt.
Sentinel</a>, though around 1908 when Forestry Club members forged a zigzag trail up the mountain and students carried up stones to shape the symbol of the University of Montana.</p>
<p>Originally made of <a>whitewashed</a> rocks and only measuring 25 feet by 25 feet, the very first &#x201c;&#x201c;M&#x201d;&#x201d; was poorly constructed and ultimately replaced by a wooden &#x201c;M&#x201d; in 1912.
This &#x201c;new and improved&#x201d; version of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; cost $18 and was different from the structure we recognize today in that it stood upright on the face of <a>Mt.
A larger wooden version of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; was built in 1913 and upkeep of the structure was formally charged to each year&#x2019;s freshman class.</p>
<p>When the large wooden &#x201c;M&#x201d; was destroyed by a blizzard in 1915, an even larger version was constructed of whitewashed granite.
Once again the freshman class was tasked with annual renovation of the symbol, beginning a new tradition.
Each year from then on, University of Montana freshman made the hike up to the &#x201c;M&#x201d; to apply a fresh coat of whitewash and remove any weeds and grass that had grown in and around the structure.</p>
<p>The annual tradition ended in 1968 when a 125 by 100 foot concrete &#x201c;M&#x201d; was built at a cost of $4,328.
Behind the decision to replace rock with concrete were maintenance issues.
With the coming of the 60s, UM students of the time exhibited waning enthusiasm for the annual trek up the hill and for annual upkeep of the &#x201c;M.&#x201d;
<p>Although the annual whitewashing went by the wayside, one tradition that lives on today is the lighting of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; during the University&#x2019;s annual <a>Homecoming</a> celebration each fall.
Originally lit by a group of students on October 9, 1919 following the fall whitewashing, the event was so popular that students have continued to light the &#x201c;M&#x201d; each year during Homecoming week.</p>
<p>Every year during Homecoming Week, UM students adorn the &#x201c;M&#x201d; with special beacons that light up the &#x201c;M&#x201d; to welcome former students back to the University.
<p>A Living Memorial On the north side of the University of Montana campus, twenty-nine evergreen trees stand in two columns, running from the corner of the Oval to Eddy Avenue.
They form Memorial Row, along what used to be the path of Van Buren Avenue.
Their history stretches back to 1919 following the end of <a>World War I</a>.
That's when the university planted the original thirty-two trees to honor men and women, connected to UM, who died in service during the war.
<p>The Forestry School nursery supplied the Western Yellow Pines.
Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors.</p>
t the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row.
By 1925, the university had increased the number of names on the official list to 35, and sometime later, it grew to 37.</p>
<p>The University of Montana - Missoula is the main campus of one of two university umbrella institutions in the state of Montana which make up the <a>Montana University System</a>, the other being <a>Montana State University</a>.
The Montana University System itself is governed by the Montana Board of Regents (consists of seven members appointed by the state governor, and confirmed by the Senate, to seven year overlapping terms in addition to the Governor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Commissioner of Higher Education as <em>ex officio</em> members of the Board.
The total operating budget for The University of Montana for Fiscal Year 2009 was approximately $345 million.
Of $135 million comes from the General Funds budget (app.
In 1990, the State of Montana provided for 69% of the educational and general funds budget.
It now supports 36% of the general fund or 17% of the university's operating budget.
This decrease in funding has, in part, been made up by the university successfully competing for sponsored research money with a growth from $12 million in 1994 to $71 million in 2009 and salaries as low as 3/5 the national average.</p>
<p> Located in Montana's capital city of <a>Helena</a>, the University of Montana Helena College of Technology is a two-year college with programs in business, trades, technical and health occupations designed to meet the state's business and industry needs for technologically- skilled workers.
The college offers technical proficiency certificates and associate degrees, as well as study toward upper-level and graduate-level programs in cooperation with other Montana University System institutions.</p>
<h4>Montana Tech of the University of Montana</h4>
<p> Montana Tech of The University of Montana was founded in <a>Butte, Montana</a> in 1889 as <em>Montana School of Mines</em>.
The college offers an array of engineering, science and technology degrees as well as general educational programs.
<h4>The University of Montana Western</h4>
<p> Located in <a>Dillon, Montana</a>, the University of Montana-Western emphasizes experiential learning combining theory and practice through projects and field experiences with an emphasis on learning through doing.
Founded as <em>Montana State Normal College</em> in 1893, the school is still known as Montana's teachers college.</p>
