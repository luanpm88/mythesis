established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|University (Main) Hall circa 1900</a> A university for the state of Montana was made possible because of an act of Congress February 18, 1881 that dedicated 72 sections (46,000 acres) for its creation.
established$$$@@@%%%Once statehood was attained by the establishment law, the Montana state legislature went about deciding the location of its university as well as a permanent capital.
established$$$@@@%%%To assure acquisition of the state university, the city of Missoula made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over the leading competitor Anaconda; supported by <a>Copper Kings</a> <a>William A. Clark</a> and <a>Marcus Daly</a> respectively.
established$$$@@@%%%Missoula won the legislative vote at the Third Legislative Assembly for the State of Montana February 1893.
established$$$@@@%%%The University was formally opened in 1895.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were temporarily held at nearby Willard School.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The South Missoula Land Company, owned by <a>A.B.
established$$$@@@%%%Hammond</a>, Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus.
established$$$@@@%%%In June 1898 the cornerstone for A.J. Gibson designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became &#x201c;the University City.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Layout</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The original plan of the University campus was designed in 1895 by one of its first professors, Frederich Scheuch, who called for the central oval to be surrounded by immediate and future University buildings.
established$$$@@@%%%Although Scheuch's plan called for all building entrances to face the center of the Oval, forming a radiating building pattern.
established$$$@@@%%%All building under this plan were designed as three-story, Renaissance Revival buildings with hipped roofs and Spanish green roof tiles.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Map and Buildings</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> After the <strong>University of Montana</strong> was founded in 1893 classes were temporarily held in the old Willard School until the first set of buildings were set up around the oval in 1895.
affiliation$$$@@@%%%Since that time, various campus plans and architectural styles have been utilized.
established$$$@@@%%%Today the campus consists of 156 acres and is bordered to the east by <a>Mount Sentinel</a> and the north by the <a>Clark Fork River</a>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The main campus comprises of 64 buildings, a 23,500-seat football stadium and nine residence halls.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Landmarks</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|The University of Montana campus</a> <strong>The Oval</strong></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Oval is a three-acre swath of grass (length east to west) that marks that traditional center of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%Today it is divided into quadrants by two intersecting brick-laid paths, though originally the oval was solid grass and forbidden to be crossed by students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A double row of trees was planted around the oval on Arbor Day 1896, but many of the trees have since died and are in the process of being replanted.
established$$$@@@%%%The original gravel driveway that once surrounded the Oval has also been replaced by sidewalk.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The original master plan of the university called for all buildings to face the center of the oval, but this plan proved difficult and an a new plan was created in 1935.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The western extreme of the Oval boasts the most iconic sculpture on campus, that of a grizzly bear.
established$$$@@@%%%Many photographs of the university picture the bear with the Oval, University (Main) Hall, and <a>Mt.
established$$$@@@%%%Sentinel</a>'s 'M' in the background.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|left|Grizzly statue with University (Main) Hall and &quot;M&quot; Trail in the distance.</a>
motto$$$@@@%%%<strong>The 'M' Trail</strong></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The 'M' is a 3/4 mile long trail with 13 switchbacks that rises 620 feet (from 3,200 feet to 3,820) from the University of Montana at the base of <a>Mt.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Sentinel</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%Numerous photos are taken of and from this Missoula landmark that offers wonderful views of the city below.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>There is debate of when The 'M' was first placed on <a>Mt.
established$$$@@@%%%Sentinel</a>, though around 1908 when Forestry Club members forged a zigzag trail up the mountain and students carried up stones to shape the symbol of the University of Montana.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Originally made of <a>whitewashed</a> rocks and only measuring 25 feet by 25 feet, the very first &#x201c;&#x201c;M&#x201d;&#x201d; was poorly constructed and ultimately replaced by a wooden &#x201c;M&#x201d; in 1912.
established$$$@@@%%%This &#x201c;new and improved&#x201d; version of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; cost $18 and was different from the structure we recognize today in that it stood upright on the face of <a>Mt.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Sentinel</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A larger wooden version of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; was built in 1913 and upkeep of the structure was formally charged to each year&#x2019;s freshman class.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When the large wooden &#x201c;M&#x201d; was destroyed by a blizzard in 1915, an even larger version was constructed of whitewashed granite.
established$$$@@@%%%Once again the freshman class was tasked with annual renovation of the symbol, beginning a new tradition.
established$$$@@@%%%Each year from then on, University of Montana freshman made the hike up to the &#x201c;M&#x201d; to apply a fresh coat of whitewash and remove any weeds and grass that had grown in and around the structure.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The annual tradition ended in 1968 when a 125 by 100 foot concrete &#x201c;M&#x201d; was built at a cost of $4,328.
established$$$@@@%%%Behind the decision to replace rock with concrete were maintenance issues.
established$$$@@@%%%With the coming of the 60s, UM students of the time exhibited waning enthusiasm for the annual trek up the hill and for annual upkeep of the &#x201c;M.&#x201d;
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The current concrete rendition of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; you see today resolved traditional maintenance concerns.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although the annual whitewashing went by the wayside, one tradition that lives on today is the lighting of the &#x201c;M&#x201d; during the University&#x2019;s annual <a>Homecoming</a> celebration each fall.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally lit by a group of students on October 9, 1919 following the fall whitewashing, the event was so popular that students have continued to light the &#x201c;M&#x201d; each year during Homecoming week.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Every year during Homecoming Week, UM students adorn the &#x201c;M&#x201d; with special beacons that light up the &#x201c;M&#x201d; to welcome former students back to the University.

established$$$@@@%%%They form Memorial Row, along what used to be the path of Van Buren Avenue.
established$$$@@@%%%Their history stretches back to 1919 following the end of <a>World War I</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%That's when the university planted the original thirty-two trees to honor men and women, connected to UM, who died in service during the war.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Some lost their lives in combat, but many more died of influenza during military training or service in Missoula and elsewhere.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Forestry School nursery supplied the Western Yellow Pines.
mascot$$$@@@%%%They are also known as <a>Ponderosa Pine</a>s and are Montana's state tree.
established$$$@@@%%%Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors.</p>

vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1925, the university replaced those boards with 35 brass name plates atop concrete markers.
established$$$@@@%%%t the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row.
