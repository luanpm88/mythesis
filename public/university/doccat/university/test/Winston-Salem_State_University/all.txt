established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%Simon Green Atkins distinguished himself in his home state of North Carolina as an advocate of teacher-training programs for African Americans.
established$$$@@@%%%He founded a small school, Winston-Salem Teachers College, that he developed into Winston-Salem State University, a four-year institution, and oversaw its transition from private to state control.
country$$$@@@%%%His abiding interest in teacher-training also led him to become a founder of the North Carolina Negro Teachers Association.
established$$$@@@%%%The oldest child of farmers and former slaves Allen and Eliza Atkins, Simon Green Atkins was born on June 11, 1863, in the village of Haywood, in <a>Chatham County, North Carolina</a>, between <a>Sanford</a> and <a>Raleigh</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%His town flourished during the period just after the <a>Revolutionary War</a>, but by the late 19th century the railroad and the neighboring town of <a>Moncure</a> had overshadowed it.
established$$$@@@%%%At one time the area was considered as a location for the state capital as well as the state university.
faculty$$$@@@%%%As a child, Atkins worked on a farm with his parents.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Atkins studied in the town school under pioneer black educators who came from St. Augustine&#x2019;s Normal and Collegiate Institute (later <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Augustine&#x2019;s College</a> in Raleigh).
established$$$@@@%%%One of these was <a>Anna Julia Cooper</a>, later prominent for her work as an activist, scholar, feminist, and school administrator in <a>Washington, D.C</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This cadre of educators went out into remote communities to teach rural blacks.
established$$$@@@%%%Atkins also taught at the town school for a while before his college years, and in 1880 he enrolled in St. Augustine&#x2019;s.
established$$$@@@%%%He spent summers teaching in the rural schools of Chatham and <a>Moore</a> counties.
established$$$@@@%%%After he graduated with distinction in 1884, renowned educator and orator Joseph Charles Price, president of <a>Livingstone College</a>, an <a>African Methodist Episcopal Zion</a> church-supported institution in <a>Salisbury, North Carolina</a>, invited Atkins to join his faculty.
established$$$@@@%%%Atkins agreed and became grammar school department head.
established$$$@@@%%%He spent six years at Livingstone (1884&#x2013;90) and spent the last two years of his tenure there in the dual role as educator and treasurer of the college.
established$$$@@@%%%During summer months he conducted institutes for black teachers in various counties.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The town educators of Winston (before its merger in 1913 with Salem to become Winston-Salem) lured Atkins to the post as principal of the Depot Street School, where he remained from 1890 to 1895.
campus$$$@@@%%%This was the state&#x2019;s largest public school for African Americans.
country$$$@@@%%%His work with the North Carolina Negro Teachers&#x2019; Association (NCNTA), which he helped to organize about 1881, had stimulated his interest in teacher-training schools for blacks.
established$$$@@@%%%He directed this group as it established the foundation for a standard black teachers&#x2019; college in the state.
established$$$@@@%%%Soon after he began his duties at Depot Street, he intensified his efforts to build such a school for African Americans and sought assistance from the Winston Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce, and local white residents.
established$$$@@@%%%By then, the state had begun plans to fund an agricultural college for its African American residents; hearing this, Atkins sought funds to locate the new college in Winston.
former_names$$$@@@%%%Local support for this move was good, as the black community donated $2,000, <a>R.
established$$$@@@%%%J. Reynolds</a> of tobacco fame contributed $500, and Atkins obtained  of land along with the backing of the Chamber of Commerce.
established$$$@@@%%%Although Atkins lobbied the state legislature in Raleigh on behalf of this plan, Winston and its residents lost out to nearby <a>Greensboro</a>, where citizens offered  of land and $11,000.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was established by Dr. Simon Green Atkins in 1892 with funds donated by industrialist <a>John Fox Slater</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Chartered by the state of North Carolina in 1897 as Slater Industrial and State Normal School and renamed Winston-Salem Teachers College in 1925, it was the first African American institution in the United States to grant degrees in elementary teacher education.
established$$$@@@%%%The name was changed to Winston-Salem State University in 1969, and it merged into the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system in 1972.</p>
