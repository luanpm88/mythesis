<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as <strong>South Park Junior College</strong>, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School (formerly South Park Middle School, the building was demolished April 2010).
South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive <a>Texas Department of Education</a> approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925.</p>
<p>In about 1932, recognizing that the junior college was now serving the region, the college renamed itself <strong>Lamar College</strong>, after <a>Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>.
The next year, the separation of the college from South Park High School began with construction of new facilities.
By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.</p>
<p>With the end of <a>World War II</a>, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment, and the Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college.
On June 14, 1949, Governor <a>Beauford Jester</a> signed the bill creating <strong>Lamar State College of Technology</strong> with the new entity to focus on engineering and science, an emphasis that continues today.</p>
