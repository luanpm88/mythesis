<h2>History</h2>
<p>Southern Oregon University began as Ashland Academy in 1872, founded in part by Reverend Henry Skidmore of Oregon's <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a>.
In 1878, the school was renamed Ashland College, and then renamed Ashland College and Normal School in 1879.
In 1887, the <a>State of Oregon</a> proclaimed the school an official state <a>normal school</a>.
However, the state did not provide any funding for the school, and in 1890 the school closed.</p>
<p>In 1904, the school became a full state school, but funding was eliminated in 1909, leading to the closing of the campus.
In 1926, the state reestablished Southern Oregon State Normal School in Ashland at a new location on land donated by the city, where the university is currently located.
The residents of Ashland passed the &quot;Normal School Site Bonds&quot; to build the new facility.
The building was later named Churchill Hall after SOSNS' president Churchill who oversaw the relocation project.
Churchill now serves as Southern's administrative building, with the president's office on the first level.
Both buildings were built at during the same time from the same architecture semantics.
The buildings were designed by architect <a>John Bennes</a> and retain their original <a>Renaissance style</a>.</p>
