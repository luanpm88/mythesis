while full-time professors focus on graduate courses, limiting their direct involvement in undergraduate education to lecturing in large sections of introductory courses and supervising graduate assistants, and by grading exams (especially <a>final exams</a>) and <a>term paper</a>s if those classes necessitate it.</p>
The emphasis of the faculty and staff in these departments is on the accomplishment of their mission areas of teaching, service, and scholarly activity.
During the first decade of the 21st century, they went through a very intense period and in the mid-part of this decade were increasingly strained.
Others on campus through some individuals on both sides were engaged in less than optimum behaviors.
Due to the intensity of the disagreements, the following academic year a special committee was set up to examine labor relations.
Subsequent to these recommendations the Vice President for Administration was replaced as well as the Executive Director of Human Resources.</p>
<p>Relations have improved since this time and are now typical of what one would expect of a unionized campus in a region that has always been at the center of US union activism.</p>
