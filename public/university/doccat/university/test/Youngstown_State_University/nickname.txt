They are actual apartments and are not affiliated with housing services at YSU, instead they are managed by an outside company, Ambling Leasing.
Organized shows are available for groups during the week, and scheduled shows available Friday and Saturday evenings (with a show geared toward a younger crowd Saturday afternoons).
In addition, YSU has 35 masters programs and over 100 undergraduate majors.</p>
