type$$$@@@%%%<p>YSU is also known as the one of the few universities to have <a>college professors</a>, rather than <a>graduate assistants</a>, directly teach undergraduate students, as it is more common at large universities to use graduate assistants.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This is because YSU has few doctoral programs and a relatively high standard teaching load (four courses per semester).
undergrad$$$@@@%%%In most colleges, graduate assistants teach courses to undergraduate students.
established$$$@@@%%%while full-time professors focus on graduate courses, limiting their direct involvement in undergraduate education to lecturing in large sections of introductory courses and supervising graduate assistants, and by grading exams (especially <a>final exams</a>) and <a>term paper</a>s if those classes necessitate it.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Departments</h2>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>YSU has Departments that cover most of the topics one would expect to see at a university of its type.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Some cover single academic disciplines/programs while others serve as administrative units to consolidate several related disciplines and programs.
staff$$$@@@%%%Some of the larger Departments have over a dozen full-time faculty and support both undergraduate and graduate degrees while others are much smaller and only participate in undergraduate programs.
established$$$@@@%%%The emphasis of the faculty and staff in these departments is on the accomplishment of their mission areas of teaching, service, and scholarly activity.
type$$$@@@%%%Each of the Departments offers strong educational opportunities and most offer many research and service activities to their students.
type$$$@@@%%%Such contributions have been growing rapidly such that many of the departments, (e.g., English, Chemistry, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) are at or near the top of national rankings for departments of their type.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This has resulted in the growth in external funding to YSU from organizations such as the National Science Foundation that has increased consistently at a double digit rate for the last decade and a half(amongst the strongest growth trajectory in the country)and total external funding to support these student-centered companies now exceeds twelve million dollars annually.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Labor relations</h2>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>Labor Unions are very active at YSU and include most non-administrative faculty and staff on campus.
established$$$@@@%%%During the first decade of the 21st century, they went through a very intense period and in the mid-part of this decade were increasingly strained.
state$$$@@@%%%In August 2005, just before the start of the 2005&#x2013;06 academic year, two of four campus unions were on strike.
staff$$$@@@%%%Following the conclusion of the strike, relations have remained strained, with some faculty and staff calling for resignation of YSU President David Sweet in May 2007.
established$$$@@@%%%Others on campus through some individuals on both sides were engaged in less than optimum behaviors.
established$$$@@@%%%Due to the intensity of the disagreements, the following academic year a special committee was set up to examine labor relations.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This committee  recommended that the bargaining units for all sides be replaced before the next contract.
established$$$@@@%%%Subsequent to these recommendations the Vice President for Administration was replaced as well as the Executive Director of Human Resources.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Relations have improved since this time and are now typical of what one would expect of a unionized campus in a region that has always been at the center of US union activism.</p>
