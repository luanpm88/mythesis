image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Origins</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was created by the <a>Alberta</a> government in 1970, Athabasca University was formed when a fourth traditional university could not be justified.
established$$$@@@%%%It grew out of the development that occurred after the <a>University of Alberta</a> had long been established, and following the creation of the <a>University of Calgary</a> after legislation had been changed, and following an order in council creating the <a>University of Lethbridge</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1967 the <a>Manning government</a> announced its intention to establish a fourth University, but it was later delayed by two to three years.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>University of Alberta</a> wanted to expand rather than see another University open in <a>Edmonton</a> to compete with it.
established$$$@@@%%%One proposal favoured establishing a Christian university instead of a secular one to cope with rising enrollment.
established$$$@@@%%%One early suggestion for an alternative was an &quot;Alberta Academy&quot; that would take credits students had earned at multiple Universities and evaluate them for transfer, and perhaps even award a degree.
established$$$@@@%%%A department of education ad hoc group favoured the establishment of a fourth University.</p>
