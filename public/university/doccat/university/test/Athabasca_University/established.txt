<p>  <strong>Athabasca University</strong> is a Canadian public university headquartered in <a>Athabasca, Alberta</a>.
It is a fully <a>accredited</a> institution specialized in the delivery of <a>distance education</a> courses and programs.
A <a>high school diploma</a> is not required for admission; however, there is an age minimum of sixteen years.
In 2004, Athabasca's <a>Executive MBA</a> was rated in the top 75 by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em>, the only executive MBA on the list that is delivered entirely online.</pre>
<p>The enabling legislation is the Post-secondary Learning Act </p>
<p>The university was created by the <a>Alberta</a> government in 1970, Athabasca University was formed when a fourth traditional university could not be justified.
It grew out of the development that occurred after the <a>University of Alberta</a> had long been established, and following the creation of the <a>University of Calgary</a> after legislation had been changed, and following an order in council creating the <a>University of Lethbridge</a>.</p>
<p>In 1967 the <a>Manning government</a> announced its intention to establish a fourth University, but it was later delayed by two to three years.
The <a>University of Alberta</a> wanted to expand rather than see another University open in <a>Edmonton</a> to compete with it.
One proposal favoured establishing a Christian university instead of a secular one to cope with rising enrollment.
One early suggestion for an alternative was an &quot;Alberta Academy&quot; that would take credits students had earned at multiple Universities and evaluate them for transfer, and perhaps even award a degree.
A department of education ad hoc group favoured the establishment of a fourth University.</p>
<p>Athabasca University reports to the government through the <a>Minister of Advanced Education</a> and is publicly funded through the Province of <a>Alberta</a>.
The university's governing council is authorized to grant degrees through the <a>Post-Secondary Learning Act</a> along with governing its own affairs.

2004 Alberta Premier [[Ralph Klein]] was accused of plagiarism in a paper he wrote for an Athabasca University course.]]
Some notable people have studied through Athabasca University, including Alberta politician <a>Debby Carlson</a>, Olympic bobsleigh racer <a>Christian Farstad</a>, Alberta Premier <a>Ralph Klein</a>, professional hockey player <a>Alyn McCauley</a>, and cross-country skier <a>Milaine Th&#x00e9;riault</a>.
<p>In May 2004 the <a>Premier of Alberta</a>, <a>Ralph Klein</a>, brought public attention to the university due to allegations that he had <a>plagiarized</a> a paper that he submitted for a communication studies course he took from the school.
While speaking before the provincial legislature, he held up a copy of the paper to provide evidence on his views about former <a>Chile</a>an dictator General <a>Augusto Pinochet</a>.
Afterwards, there was public criticism that portions of five pages of the 13-page paper had been copied from the Internet without proper citations to the sources.
The university investigated the matter and told the news media that Klein's instructor had noted the mistake when grading the paper and offered guidance for correcting it.
A university spokesman described the failure to properly cite sources as a &quot;relatively minor error, undisputed by [the] student, easily corrected, and not an ongoing or repeated problem.&quot;</p>
