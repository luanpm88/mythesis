The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in <a>Washington County</a> established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the <a>American frontier</a> in the 1780s: <a>John McMillan</a>, <a>Thaddeus Dod</a>, and <a>Joseph Smith</a>.
These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in <a>Canonsburg</a> and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington.
These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College.
The  campus, located in Washington, Pennsylvania, has more than 40 buildings, with the oldest dating to 1793.
While the college has historically had a difficult relationship with the city of Washington, including clashes over college expansion and finances, recent efforts have been made to improve those relations.</p>
The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges.
Students operate a college radio station, a campus newspaper, and a literary journal.
The football team has been particularly successful over its history, even competing in the <a>1922 Rose Bowl</a>.
A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics.
A number of noteworthy alumni have attended the college or its predecessor institutions, including <a>James G. Blaine</a>, <a>William Holmes McGuffey</a>, and <a>Pete Henry</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history and the academies</h3>
<p>Washington &amp; Jefferson College traces its origin to three log cabin colleges established by three frontier clergymen in the 1780s: <a>John McMillan</a>, <a>Thaddeus Dod</a>, and <a>Joseph Smith</a>.
John McMillan, the most prominent of the three founders because of his strong personality and longevity, came to the area in 1775 and built his log cabin college in 1780 near his church in <a>Chartiers</a>.
[[File:McMillan Hall W&amp;J College 4.jpg|thumb|left|Washington Academy's sole building (now called [[McMillan Hall]]), showing the original central portion and the two wings added in 1818.]]
Washington Academy was chartered by the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> on September 24, 1787.
The first members of the board of trustees included Reverends Dod and Smith.
At an subsequent unknown date, McMillan transferred his students from the log cabin to Canonsburg Academy.
In 1806, <a>Matthew Brown</a> petitioned the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> to grant Washington Academy a charter, allowing it to be re-christened as Washington College.
In the ensuing years, both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves, especially over-selling scholarships.
Desperate for funds, Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling to take control of the college, a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time.
However, Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances.</p>

Following the <a>Civil War</a>, both colleges were short on students and on funds, causing them to join together as Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 1865.
The charter provided for the college to operate at both Canonsburg and Washington, a position that caused significant difficulty an the administration trying to rescue the college amid ill feelings over the unification.
Edwards immediately encountered significant challenges, including the difficulties of administering a college across two campuses, as well as old prejudices and hard feelings among those still loyal to either Jefferson College or Washington College.
Leadership of the college during this time fell to <a>Samuel J. Wilson</a>,a local pastor, and <a>James I. Brownson</a>, who had earlier been interim president of Washington College.
His successor, <a>James D. Moffat</a>, led the college through a period of growth where the college constructed the <a>Old Gym</a>, <a>Hays Hall</a>, <a>Thompson Memorial Library</a>, and <a>Thistle Physics Building</a>, as well as purchasing the land known as the &quot;old fair ground,&quot; now used for <a>Cameron Stadium</a>.
Towards the end of his term, Moffat personally paid for the 1912 renovations of <a>McMillan Hall</a>.
His tenure was dominated by the United States' entry into <a>World War I</a>, with an enrollment drop of 50%.
<a>William E. Slemmons</a>, a college trustee and adjunct professor, succeeded Hinitt and served as interim president from May 1918 to June 1919.
After the war ended in 1919, <a>Samuel Charles Black</a> took over and helped to stabilize the enrollment.
His successor, <a>Simon Strousse Baker</a>, was well-liked by the college's trustees and by &quot;many a townsman,&quot; but the student body felt that Baker was &quot;autocratic&quot; and held an &quot;unfriendly attitude toward the student body as individuals.&quot;
When <a>World War II</a> broke out, the campus was opened to the Army Administration School, where hundreds of soldiers received their &quot;training in classifications.&quot;
Hutchison resigned in 1945 to take the presidency of his alma mater, <a>Lafayette College</a>.
In 1950, <a>Boyd Crumrine Patterson</a> assumed the presidency and oversaw curriculum revisions and the construction of a number of buildings, including the <a>Henry Memorial Center</a>, 10 <a>Greek</a> housing units in the center of campus, the <a>U.
His fundrasing abilities grew the college's endowment expanded from $2.3 million to nearly $11 million.
Patterson retired in 1970, the same year that the trustees authorized the admission of women as undergraduate students.
The college also adopted a new <a>academic calendar</a> to include <a>intersession</a> and expanded its academic programs to include the Entrepreneurial Studies Program, the Freshman Forum, and several cooperative international education programs.
In 2004, <a>Tori Haring-Smith</a> became the first woman to serve as president of Washington &amp; Jefferson, undertaking an effort to improve the science curriculum and to construct the <a>Swanson Science Center</a>.
<p>As a <a>liberal arts college</a>, Washington &amp; Jefferson College focuses exclusively on <a>undergraduate education</a>.
The college's teaching environment reflects the liberal arts tradition of small group instruction by maintaining an average class size of 17 and a <a>student/faculty ratio</a> of 12:1.
<p>The curriculum is centered around the traditional <a>liberal arts</a> education and <a>pre-professional classes</a>.

<p>The college's current logo features a stylized version of the two towers of <a>Old Main</a>, symbolizing the 1865 unification of Washington College and Jefferson College.
The logo may be displayed in several versions: with the entire name of the college, the shortened form of &quot;W&amp;J&quot;, or without any text.
The relationship between the town and college were strong enough that the citizens of Washington offered a $50,000 donation in 1869 to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby <a>Canonsburg</a> as the consolidated location of the college.
However, the relationship was strained through most of the 20th century, as the college pursued an expansion policy that clashed with the residential neighborhood.
The college's frustrations grew after preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to pass laws prohibiting the college from demolishing certain buildings that were listed on the <a>East Washington Historic District</a>.
Relations were so bad that residents and college officials engaged in a shouting match at a meeting.
Local preservationists also unsuccessfully tried to block the demolition of <a>Hays Hall</a>, which had been condemned.
In the 1990s, the city of Washington made several unsuccessful attempts to challenge the college's tax-exempt status.
In 1993, Washington appealed the Washington County Board of Assessment's determination that the college was exempt from the city's <a>property tax</a>.
That case went to the <a>Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a>, which ruled in favor of the college.
Separately, the city of Washington passed an ordinance that levied a municipal &quot;service fee&quot; against the College students, which was ruled to be illegal and was struck down.
Before the union of the two colleges, Washington College graduated 872 men and Jefferson College graduated 1,936 men.
These alumni include <a>James G. Blaine</a>, who served in <a>Congress</a> as <a>Speaker of the House</a>, <a>U.S. Senator</a> from <a>Maine</a>, two-time <a>United States Secretary of State</a> and the <a>Republican</a> nominee for the <a>1884 presidential election</a>.
