established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early history and the academies</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Washington &amp; Jefferson College traces its origin to three log cabin colleges established by three frontier clergymen in the 1780s: <a>John McMillan</a>, <a>Thaddeus Dod</a>, and <a>Joseph Smith</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%John McMillan, the most prominent of the three founders because of his strong personality and longevity, came to the area in 1775 and built his log cabin college in 1780 near his church in <a>Chartiers</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%[[File:McMillan Hall W&amp;J College 4.jpg|thumb|left|Washington Academy's sole building (now called [[McMillan Hall]]), showing the original central portion and the two wings added in 1818.]]
established$$$@@@%%%Washington Academy was chartered by the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> on September 24, 1787.
established$$$@@@%%%The first members of the board of trustees included Reverends Dod and Smith.
established$$$@@@%%%At an subsequent unknown date, McMillan transferred his students from the log cabin to Canonsburg Academy.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1806, <a>Matthew Brown</a> petitioned the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> to grant Washington Academy a charter, allowing it to be re-christened as Washington College.
mascot$$$@@@%%%At various times over the next 60 years, the various parties within the two colleges pursued unification with each other, but the question of where the unified college would be located thwarted those efforts.
established$$$@@@%%%In the ensuing years, both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves, especially over-selling scholarships.
established$$$@@@%%%Desperate for funds, Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling to take control of the college, a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time.
established$$$@@@%%%However, Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances.</p>
