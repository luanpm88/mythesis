image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding</h3>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Mount Saint Clare, circa 1920.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%Ashford University traces its origins back to 1891, when Father James A. Murray invited the Sisters of St. Francis to help teach in Clinton, Iowa.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1893, the Sisters were able to purchase some land in Clinton, on which they established their mother house and the Mount St. Clare Academy, a boarding and day school for girls.
established$$$@@@%%%The Academy and the mother house quickly outgrew their old building.
type$$$@@@%%%In 1910, the mother house and the academy moved into the newly constructed Mount St. Clare building, which is still in use today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Seeing a need for higher education in <a>Clinton County</a> and the surrounding area, the Sisters founded <strong>Mount St. Clare College</strong>, a liberal arts institution and the direct predecessor to Ashford University, in 1918.
established$$$@@@%%%At that time, the Mount St. Clare Academy, College, and Convent were all housed in the same building.
established$$$@@@%%%Mount St. Clare College was on the approved list of teacher education colleges in Iowa from 1932 to 1954 when the State raised the requirements.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1942, 60% of the rural teachers in Clinton County and 62% of the teachers in the city of Clinton school system had received all of their training from Mount St. Clare College.</p>
