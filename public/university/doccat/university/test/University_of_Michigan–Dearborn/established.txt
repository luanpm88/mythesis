<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Chancellor's Pond</a> The University of Michigan-Dearborn was founded in 1959 with a gift of  and $6.5 million dollars from <a>Ford Motor Company</a>.
Built as an elite automotive engineering and business management school, UM-D started near the Rouge River on what is known as <a>Fair Lane</a>.
As the university quickly grew to respond to the metropolitan region's needs, it established full fledged colleges in the arts, business, engineering, and education.</p>
<p>During the late 1990s and 2000s, the University approved the purchase of buildings north of Fair Lane and the construction and overhaul of several university buildings including the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters building, the University Center, the Science Learning and Research Center, and finally the Institute for Advanced Vehicular Studies.
<p>In November 2008, the <a>University of Michigan</a> board of regents approved the establishment of Ph.D programs in information systems engineering and automotive systems engineering in the UM&#x2013;Dearborn College of Engineering and Computer Science beginning in Fall 2009.
In February 2009, the regents approved an Ed.D. program at the UM-Dearborn School of Education, designed to provide the citizens of southeastern Michigan with a program that is well-matched to the economic, social and political challenges that face our region.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2008, facility planners at University of Michigan Dearborn began to consider adding a <a>dormitory</a> building to the campus for undergraduate students.
The school issued an online survey to gain information about what the students felt would be the best option.
The dormitory would be aimed at encouraging students to stay on campus full time to provide a better college environment feel.
The aim would also be to gain additional students from around the state and country.
The addition of dorms could also serve to ease the parking situation which has become a large problem for students especially in the peak hours for class.</p>
<p><a>thumb|150px|right|UM-Dearborn Campus</a> The campus of the University of Michigan&#x2013;Dearborn is divided into several sections: The Henry Ford Estate, known as <a>Fair Lane</a>, The Fairlane Center, Main Campus, and recently has expanded the Early Childhood Education Center just south of campus.
In addition, the University boasts over 70 acres (283,000 m&#x00b2;) of nature preserve and a bird observatory,the Rouge River Bird Observatory, which has operated on campus since its founding in 1992.

The main building houses the College's administrative offices and the departments of Behavioral Sciences, Humanities and Mathematics.
General purpose classrooms occupy the majority of the first level, along with the campus television studio.
Regular feedback from its Visiting Committee, composed of industrial leaders, develop lab facilities and design  research projects in the college.
An outcome of the industry partnership was the establishment of the Henry W. Patton Center for Engineering Education and Practice.
The Center incorporates engineering practice, design, innovation and concepts of manufacturing technology at all levels of engineering education by integrating the teaching environment with the world of practice.
<h3>College of Business</h3>
Each program is characterized by limited class size.
The primary mission is complemented by faculty's commitment to making intellectual contributions.
<p>The COB offers undergraduate programs in Accounting, Finance, General Business, General Business (Pre-Law), Human Resource Management, Information Technology Management, Management, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management.
The College of Business's programs have recently been recognized as of the best in the country.</p>

Notably, during the construction of Hines Drive, a road cutting through a local parks system, the students protested and halted the construction of Hines Drive through campus.
It was originally intended to connect to Michigan Avenue, but instead stops now at Ford Road.
<p>In 2007, the University agreed to install foot baths after talks with the Muslim Students' Association, said Terry Gallagher, director of public relations at the campus.
