established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>frame|left</a> Fairfield's seal combines elements of its several traditions.
established$$$@@@%%%The gold pinecones come from the coat of arms of the family of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.</a>, for whom the university was originally named.
established$$$@@@%%%Superimposed on the cones is the badge of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> - the letters IHS surmounted by the cross and surrounded by the instruments of Christ's passion - to indicate that the University is in the care of members of the same religious family.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>There are three compartments in the upper portion of the shield, because &quot;the school is dedicated and exists in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit.&quot;
