<h2>History and tradition</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Fairfield University was founded in 1942 by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> when the Jesuits acquired the two contiguous estates of the Jennings and Lashar families.
John J. McEleney, S.J.</a> the first President of the &quot;Fairfield University of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.</a>&quot; and Vicar of the <a>Fairfield College Preparatory School</a>.
During his tenure, Fairfield University was chartered by the State of Connecticut to grant degrees in 1945; the first class of 303 male students was admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences in 1947; the College of Arts and Sciences was accredited by the State of Connecticut and the first summer session of undergraduate courses was held in 1949.</p>
<p>In 1971, Fairfield University won a significant legal victory at the <a>Supreme Court of the United States</a> in <em>Tilton vs. Richardson</em> establishing an important legal precedent concerning the <a>Establishment Clause of the First Amendment</a> and government financial assistance to religious-based colleges and universities.
An appeal by the plaintiffs was denied by the Supreme Court on June 28, 1971, ensuring Fairfield a significant amount of federal money which contributed to the construction of the <a>Nyselius Library</a> (1968) and Bannow Science Center (1971).
In the majority opinion, the Court upheld, 5-4, the federal construction grants as long as the facilities were not to be used for sectarian instruction or places of worship.
Further, a brief history of <strong>The Jesuits in Fairfield</strong> can be found on The Fairfield Jesuit Community website.</p>
<p>During the <a>American Revolutionary War</a> in 1779, the &quot;Battle of Round Hill&quot; took place on the present day Bellarmine Hill on the campus of the university where the Americans under the command of Colonel Samuel Whiting (whose third-generation grandson Andrew Whiting graduated in 2005) repelled the British invaders under the command of Major-General <a>William Tryon</a>, but not before the British laid ruin to the Town of Fairfield.</p>
<p>In September 2000, <a>Charles F. Dolan H'04</a>, founder of <a>HBO</a> and chairman of <a>Cablevision</a>, donated $25 million to the renamed <a>Charles F. Dolan School of Business</a>, which still represents one of the largest donations from a single source to a <a>business school</a>.</p>

<h3>Seal of the University</h3>
<p><a>frame|left</a> Fairfield's seal combines elements of its several traditions.
The gold pinecones come from the coat of arms of the family of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.</a>, for whom the university was originally named.
Superimposed on the cones is the badge of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> - the letters IHS surmounted by the cross and surrounded by the instruments of Christ's passion - to indicate that the University is in the care of members of the same religious family.</p>
The central compartment portrays a hart crossing a ford, a part of the coat of arms of the <a>Diocese of Hartford</a>, whose boundaries encompassed the <a>Town of Fairfield</a>, when the University was founded.
Finally, the two outer compartments show clusters of grapes, charges taken from the town seal and symbolic of the fertility of the verdant fields of the Town and County of Fairfield.
When the University was founded in 1942, the official name of the University was &quot;Fairfield University of St. Robert Bellarmine&quot;.
Three of the original seals with this name still exist on campus - in the main lobby of Alumni Hall, on the exterior of the Barone Campus Center, and on the glass front of Regis Hall facing the Quad.</p>
<p>Fairfield's Jesuit ethos trains students in scholarship, prepares them for leadership, encourages them to engage in service projects; and develops graduates with strong social concerns for the common good.
The university is an intellectual, social, spiritual, and cultural destination of choice for students and faculty from a   diversity of backgrounds.

<p><a>thumb|left|300px|John C. Dolan Hall</a> Fairfield University guarantees first year students four years of campus housing and provides several housing options depending on their class.
Most underclassman live on campus and live the typical <a>residence hall</a> life in the <strong>Quad</strong> or <strong>The Orient</strong> sections of campus.
Students typically choose to live in The Quad in order to be close to the classroom buildings and to enjoy the annual battle of dorms water fights; and frisbee and wiffleball games during the warm weather.
<strong>The Orient</strong> is located in the southeast corner of campus and consists of Kostka Hall and Claver Hall which is suite style living, and also the apartments, the newest on campus housing.
<strong>Dolan Hall</strong> is located in the northeast corner of campus is the primary residence hall for students who request to live in singles housing.
<p>Loyola Hall is home to the <strong>Ignatian Residential College</strong>, which offers a unique <a>residential college</a> experience for Fairfield sophomores.
Funded by a $2 million grant from the <a>Lilly Endowment</a>, the program provides over 200 students with the opportunity to study and live together while pondering questions of identity, faith and purpose.
In addition to living together and taking two classes together students meet once per month in groups of ten with a mentor, hear from weekly speakers, attend one overnight retreat per semester, and take cultural trips.</p>
The program will allow up to 140 sophomores,   committed to community service and social justice, to go beyond the small community service groups at Campus Ministry and live with a group of individuals concerned with life outside of Fairfield County.
In 2007, townhouse basements have been closed off to students, after an incident in which the administration and Fairfield fire department deemed the basements a fire hazard.
During the warmer weather students enjoy their back porches and lawns with an occasional barbecue and wiffleball game.
The  Apartment Village   was opened in September 2000.
Fairfield Beach is  a unique Fairfield living experience for 200 eligible students to rent beach houses along the Long Island Sound.
However, as it  has evolved from a part-time summer beach community into a more permanent residential community, Fairfield Beach has become a source of strain on town-gown relations leading to greater controls over student social life including a ban on large gatherings at Lantern Point since 2001 due to a court injunction.<img></p>
<p>The goal of Jesuit education is <em>homines pro aliis</em>, &#x201c;men and women for others&#x201d;.
Fairfield was among just 119 colleges in the nation named to the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement in 2008.
The Fairfield chapter of <strong>Colleges Against Cancer</strong> hosts an annual <a>American Cancer Society</a> <a>Relay for Life</a>, an overnight event designed to spread awareness of <a>cancer</a> prevention, treatments and cures, celebrate <a>cancer survivors</a> and raise money for <a>cancer research</a>.
<a>Mexico</a>, <a>Jamaica</a>, <a>Belize</a> and <a>Haiti</a>.
In 2004, Mikaela Conley '06 and Aamina Awan '07 founded <strong>The Afghan Children's Project</strong> to raise awareness and funds for children who have suffered the effects of war, violence, and poverty in the heart of <a>Afghanistan</a>.
Both were interviewed on <a>CNN Daybreak</a> in August 2005 for their work in funding the building of a <a>water well</a> for Aloudine, a small village outside <a>Kabul</a>, desperate for clean drinking water.
And in 2008, nine Fairfield students, inspired by 2006 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> recipient <a>Muhammad Yunus</a> and the <a>Grameen Bank</a>, started <strong>Sustainable Equity for Women</strong>, a <a>micro-lending</a> project designed to raise and invest money in small businesses run by women in <a>developing countries</a> in conjunction with <a>Kiva Microfunds</a>.</p>
Valuing a mix of experiences in the classroom and on campus, increasing <a>diversity</a> at Fairfield is a major goal of the University's Strategic Vision, and in 2005, during the University's <a>Dr.
Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a>, called on the university   to join him in efforts to increase <a>diversity</a> at the institution.
For this reason, the <strong>Office of Institutional Diversity Initiatives</strong> and the <strong>Office of Student Diversity Programs</strong> were created to pursue a number of initiatives to increase <a>racial</a> and <a>socioeconomic</a> <a>diversity</a>.
The  legislative branch  consists of the <strong>Student Senate</strong>, comprising 40 elected representatives (10 from each undergraduate class year).
The  executive branch  is headed by the popularly elected  President  of FUSA, who serves as the official spokesperson for undergraduate students in addition to administering the student association on a daily basis.
In 2002, Karen Donoghue '03 became the first women elected President of FUSA.
The FUSA President is assisted by a popularly elected Vice President, elected class officers, and a number of other appointed officers, including the Executive Director of Programming and the Executive Director of Clubs &amp; Organizations.
<p>A central tenet of a <a>Jesuit</a> education is the promotion of the <a>values</a> of <a>peace</a> and <a>social justice</a>.
Fairfield University students have embraced and reflected these values in their own <a>student activism</a>.
In 1988, 1989 and 1990, the <strong>Coalition for a Better World</strong> constructed &quot;Cardboard City&quot; and held a 36 hour vigil,  and again in 2008, the <strong>Students for Social Justice</strong> similarly constructed &quot;Homeless Village&quot; and hosted the <a>&quot;Oxfam Hunger Banquet&quot;</a> to raise awareness of the plight of the <a>homeless</a> in the United States.
In 1999, students staged an 11-hour sit-in at the home of the university president and later a <a>hunger strike</a> to protest a contracting company used by the university that the students said was anti-union and paid janitors poorly.
Each year, the Students for Social Justice travel to <a>Columbus, Georgia</a> for the annual <a>School of the Americas Watch</a> protest at a combat training school for Latin American soldiers now known as the <a>Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation</a>.
The date of the protest marks the anniversary of the murder of six <a>Jesuit</a> priests, their maid, and her daughter in <a>El Salvador</a> at the hands of soldiers trained at the School of the Americas.
And in 2008, <strong>Fairfield for Peace NOW</strong> created &quot;Hope Trail&quot;, a pathway of flags around campus symbolizing the cost in life and casualties from the <a>Iraq War</a>, and &quot;A Cry For Peace&quot;, a play written and performed with Theatre Fairfield demonstrating the toll of the <a>Iraq War</a> on the families of soldiers back in the United States.</p>
The oldest club on campus is the <a>Fairfield University Glee Club</a> which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2007.
The Fairfield University Debate Team of Jason LaRue '99 and Courtney Darts '01 won first place at the 1998 Columbia University <a>Parliamentary Debate Tournament</a> beating 69 other teams, including teams from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Yale and Williams.</p>
