Fairfield faculty members have published hundreds of scholarly articles and books in the past two years.</li>
&quot;Fairfield students will emerge as leaders within the region and the nation for their creativity and talent in film, television and radio within this exciting new program.&quot;</p>
<p>The Media Center staff and New Media students have won national recognition for their  programs and production of multimedia presentations for the university.
The program is not inherently religious, but should attract students of all faiths, races and socioeconomic backgrounds who want to do something to help the Fairfield community and beyond.</p>
There are between five and seven students living in each townhouse which has two or three bedrooms upstairs, a living and dining area, a kitchen and two bathrooms.
These <a>diversity</a> initiatives are helped annually by the Fairfield Awards Dinner held in <a>New York City</a> in which funds are raised for <strong>The Alumni Multicultural Scholarship Fund</strong>.
