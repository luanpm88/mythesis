image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1904&ndash;1941</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Gold Star Memorial Building (Law Library), an Oklahoma landmark</a> <a>thumb|right|Meinders School of Business</a> <a>right|thumb|Interior of MSB</a>  The first incarnation of Oklahoma City University was called <strong>Epworth University</strong>, which still stands near Classen SAS High School.
established$$$@@@%%%Anton Classen was heavily involved with development of early Oklahoma City and advanced the idea of a Methodist university in Oklahoma.
established$$$@@@%%%Classen managed to generate interest in this idea and in 1901 two branches of the Methodist Church embarked on the establishment of a Methodist university.
established$$$@@@%%%Construction began in 1902 and classes started in 1904 with enrollment growing by almost 100 students during that first year.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Lack of financial support caused Epworth to close in 1911 but classes began at OCU's second incarnation, <strong>Oklahoma Methodist University</strong>, in Guthrie, only months later.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1919, trustees decided to close the Guthrie location and make a fresh start in Oklahoma City with a new institution called <strong>Oklahoma City College</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%With funding from the Methodist congregations, new college grounds were planned and built in 1922.
established$$$@@@%%%The school thrived in its new home and its successful transition was formally acknowledged when OCC changed its name to Oklahoma City University in 1924.
established$$$@@@%%%Athletics took off as more students enrolled, but with the onset of the Great Depression OCU faced great financial strain.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1942&ndash;1960</h3>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%Cluster Smith assumed the presidency after the <a>Great Depression</a> and began to tackle new challenges emerged - namely, <a>World War II</a> and stemming problems.
established$$$@@@%%%As the country entered the war, OCU was deeply in debt and needed new facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%Faculty members were paid late more often than not and a number of trustees personally signed for loans so that salaries could be paid.
established$$$@@@%%%Male students abandoned their studies to join the military and in 1942, about 75 percent of the student body was women.
nickname$$$@@@%%%A shortage of players and funds caused many of the athletic programs to shut down, including the beloved football team.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The end of the war in 1945 brought about an unprecedented surge in enrollment.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, there was an extraordinary amount of development through the remainder of the 40's.
established$$$@@@%%%Construction on a particularly special addition, the Gold Star Building, which memorialized the Americans felled by World War II, began in 1949.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 1950s, OCU earned accreditation from the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It also absorbed the Oklahoma City College of Law and embarked upon the Great Plan, a partnership with the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> designed to elevate the academic discourse and thereby deepen the quality of education offered to all students.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1960&ndash;1979</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Great Plan was a great success; inspiring positive changes across campus and interdisciplinary approaches at all levels.
established$$$@@@%%%Departments worked together to create courses that approached lofty topics from a variety of perspectives and taught students to look at life in a new way.
established$$$@@@%%%OCU's spiritual life was also under construction and the Bishop W. Angie Smith Chapel was dedicated in 1968.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Jane Jayroe</a> had become OCU's first student to earn the title of <a>Miss America</a> and programs across campus were thriving.
established$$$@@@%%%Financial troubles were softened by the excitement of the times but unfortunately could no longer be ignored.
students$$$@@@%%%By 1976, the financial situation had escalated, sending waves of worry across campus and around town.
established$$$@@@%%%A long list of drastic measures was put together in an effort to save the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Bishop Paul Milhouse held firmly to his faith and aired the school's woes to the Annual Conference of Oklahoma Methodist churches in <a>Tulsa</a>, requesting that people direct their prayers and pledges to the University.
established$$$@@@%%%The conference attendees responded with $200,000 and the spirit of giving trickled down into individual congregations.
established$$$@@@%%%Pledges poured in from all over the state and by 1980, the <a>Methodist Church</a> had raised more than $3 million.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Morale improved, as did enrollment.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1979&ndash;1997</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A crisis had been narrowly averted, but OCU remained in a precarious position.
type$$$@@@%%%Jerald Walker, an OCU alumnus became president in 1979.
established$$$@@@%%%Walker restored the climate of prosperity and placidity to OCU in record time.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Quickly, he made a series of changes that were engineered for maximum impact.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Facilities were improved, new programs were offered and students were aggressively recruited.
established$$$@@@%%%By the summer of 1981, President Walker proudly announced that OCU was not only debt free, but that it had turned a profit for the first time since 1975.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Out of crisis mode, OCU finally had the opportunity to spread its wings.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 80's, Law students moved into their new home, <a>Susan Powell</a> became the school's second Miss America, the school of religion joined the campus and a new nursing program was launched.
established$$$@@@%%%The Oklahoma Opera and Music Theater Company was founded in 1982 and programs expanding OCU's international presence were established.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>1998&ndash;present</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the turn of the century, Oklahoma City University was ready to usher in some of the best years the university had ever known.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus received a dramatic face-lift, new community partnerships were forged, and the university's mission to prepare students to be servant leaders was the guiding spirit behind it all.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Stephen Jennings became the university's new leader in 1998 focusing on keeping the university in tip-top shape for its 100th birthday.
established$$$@@@%%%Jennings oversaw the transformation from the Chiefs to the Stars and launched the Distinguished Speakers Series.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A few years later, in 2001, Tom McDaniel became president and his leadership has transformed the university.
students$$$@@@%%%The most obvious change, of course, has been the drastically altered face of campus, which has benefited from an influx of donations.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The Ann Lacy Visitor and Admissions Center, the Norick Art Center, and the Edith Kinney Gaylord Center - not to mention the business school, music center and the new residence hall - have given the campus an architectural update and offer students more academic space and amenities.
