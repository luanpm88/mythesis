<h2>History</h2>
During the &quot;search for alternatives&quot; period in the 1930s, political centralization and the first attempt to provide Brazil with modern administrative, military and educational institutions took place.
The main initiatives included the University of S&#x00e3;o Paulo, which was created in 1934.
Its nucleus was the creation of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, with professors coming from <a>France</a>, <a>Italy</a>, <a>Spain</a>, <a>Germany</a> and other European countries.
<p>USP also brought together several research and higher-education institutions in the state created before, such as the Faculty of Medicine (Faculdade de Medicina), the <a>Polytechnic School</a> (Escola Polit&#x00e9;cnica), and the <a>College of Law</a> (Faculdade de Direito).
<li><strong>Part I:</strong> composed of 90 multiple-choice questions on <a>Portuguese</a>, English, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Geography</a>, <a>History</a> and <a>Biology</a>.</li>
The &quot;cut-off&quot; grade varies from year to year, because it depends on the performance of the candidates and the number of available places in each course.
<p>Moreover, candidates who only attended a public high-school receive an extra 12% on their final Part I and Part II scores, arguably, in order to compensate for the general low quality of Brazilian public basic education.</p>
<p>USP's entrance exam is prepared and administered by FUVEST (University Foundation for Vestibular), subject to regulations approved by the university's Undergraduate Studies Council.
In 2006, 142,656 students signed up for Fuvest's vestibular to apply for admission to the University of S&#x00e3;o Paulo.
USP is a free university, and students do not have to pay any tuition fees.</p>
This can be compared with the general population of the Metropolitan Region of S&#x00e3;o Paulo, in the same year of 2001, which was 65.33% White, 1.84% Yellow (East Asian), 26.88% &quot;parda&quot;, 5.83% Black, and 0.12% Amerindian, showing indeed a high level of overrepresentation of Whites and Yellows, corresponding to an equivalent underrepresentation of Blacks and &quot;pardos&quot;.
This disproportion reflects the huge racial disparities in Brazil, between Whites (and &quot;Yellows&quot;) on one hand, and non-Whites on the other.</p>
