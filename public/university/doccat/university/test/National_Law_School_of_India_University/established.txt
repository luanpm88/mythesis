<p>The  <strong>National Law School of India University</strong> (NLSIU or NLS) is an institution for under-graduate and graduate legal education.
Based in Nagarbhavi, a suburb in the western extremities of the city of <a>Bangalore</a>, the NLSIU was established in <a>1987</a> after a <a>statute</a> was enacted for that purpose by the Legislative Assembly of the State of <a>Karnataka</a>, and officially exists since August 29, 1987.</p>
<p>Historically, legal education in India was open only to graduates and seen merely as professional training.
Dismayed at the quality of legal education in conventional universities, members of the legal fraternity debated the merits of introducing a new system of legal education through the 1970s and 1980s.
NLSIU has been consistently ranked as the best law school in India for 8 out of the past 10 years by <a>India Today</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Bar Council of India</a> decided to make the NLSIU law programme a five-year course (in contrast with the American post-graduate system), with courses in the liberal arts included in the first two years.
NLSIU has exchange programmes in place with <a>Georgetown University</a> in the United States, the <a>National University of Singapore</a>, Canada's <a>Osgoode Hall Law School</a> and Germany's <a>Hamburg University</a> and <a>University of Munich</a>.
<p>In its Post-Graduate Degree Course (LL.M.), NLSIU presently offers two specializations, one in Business Laws and the other in Human Rights.
This course aims at producing scholars/experts in the pertinent field of law.
A prospectus can be obtained from NLSIU on payment of the requisite fee.</p>
<p>NLSIU also offers part-time distance learning programmes, including a<a>Masters Degree</a> in <a>Business Law</a> and <a>Postgraduate Diploma</a> programs in <a>Human Rights Law</a>, Medical Law, <a>Environmental Law</a> and <a>IP Law</a>.</p>
<p>NLSIU was started in 1987 under the stewardship of its Founder-Director, <a>Dr.
The first classes commenced even before the college buildings had been built, and thus the NLSIU started functioning from the premises of the Central College, Bangalore University and continued there until November 1991, when it finally moved to its present location in Nagarbhavi.</p>
A Jayagovind and Dr. G. Mohan Gopal have held the position of Director of the NLSIU.</p>
Students from the National Law School publish an informal literary magazine called Quirk since January 2005.</p>
It recently won the 15th All Asian Debating Championships held in Dhaka in 2008, with 3 out of the 4 semi-finalist teams, and 6 of the top 10 speakers, being from NLSIU.
Another boost for the Parliamentary Debate movement in NLSIU came in the form of the <a>Cambridge University</a> Debate Competition 2009, where the NLSIU team became the first South Asian team to reach the second round of the competition.
NLSIU has also performed extremely well in the inaugural Asians BP Tournament held in Chulalongkorn University, with all three of its teams reaching the semi finals of the tournament, and two out of the top ten speakers (and four in the top 20).</p>
It is the only University in South Asia to have won the prestigious <a>Jessup Cup</a>.
Reaffirming its supremacy, NLSIU became the first team from India to emerge as the World Champion at the Manfred Lachs Moot 2009, defeating Georgetown University (United States) in the Final held at Daejeon, South Korea, adjudicated by their Excellencies Judges Koroma, Tomka and Skotnikov.
Raeesa Vakil of the NLSIU was awarded the Sterns and Tennen Best Oralist Award, outdoing team mate Abhimanyu George Jain, who had won the Best Oralist award at the Asia-Pacific level.
The library is the 'heart' of the academic institution and plays an important role in all academic activities.
Keeping in view the aims and objectives of the Law School, the library has been planned and is being developed by a team of qualified professional library staff, guided by the Library Council.
It has a collection of over 40,000 volumes covering a wide range of general and special subjects consisting of text books, reference books, back volumes of journals and reports etc., apart from current legal periodicals.
The library has adopted an open access system so as to facilitate easy access to library resources.</p>
<p>The NLSIU Library has also established links with other important libraries in and around Bangalore in order to provide inter-library access for the benefit of students and teachers of the NLSIU.
Further, essential reading materials will be supplied to the students in each subject at the beginning of the trimester by the University.
<p>The NLSIU has introduced computerized facilities for both housekeeping as well as information retrieval.
Keeping in mind the vision to create an E-Law School, the University subscribes to many international online databases like <a>Westlaw International</a>, <a>JSTOR</a>, <a>Kluwer Online</a>, Springer Link etc. which contains enormous resources like international case reporters, statutes, and articles from law reviews, an invaluable source for a law school student.
With a computerized library system it is the aim of the library to establish a network of law libraries in India and also to establish a National Legal Information Centre, which will act as a clearing house of information in the field of law.</p>

The building has been designed by well- known architects, with the financial assistance of the <a>University Grants Commission (India)</a>and Mrs. Sudha Murthy.</p>
The co-ordination council consists of the student Convenors/Joint Convenors of the ABCs.
They're the ones who assign project guides for the first years, and hold &quot;crash course&quot; classes the nights before the exams.</p>

<p>NLS hosts an inter-collegiate literary and cultural festival called Legala, along with RampArt (fashion show) and Strawberry Fields.
Those apart, NLSIU hosts the Annual National Law School International Debate, a parliamentary-style debating championship which gets participation from countries around the SAARC region.
<p>Strawberry Fields presents a host of different styles of music ranging from funk to death metal, and Strawberry Fields' promoters credit it for having acted as launching pad for the careers of a few bands such as <a>Pin Drop Violence</a> and <a>Junkyard Groove</a>.</p>
<p>As stated by a former director, one of the principal objectives in establishing the NLSIU was to increase the quality of the <a>bar</a>.
However, it has been pointed out that most of those who graduate from NLSIU prefer a career in corporate litigation or as legal advisers to companies, instead of joining the bar.
This was intensified when <a>Clifford Chance</a> and the rest of the <a>Magic Circle</a>, <a>Silver Circle</a> law firms handed training contracts to twelve NLS students in 2006, which led to criticism by the Executive Council, including the Chief Justice, that not enough alumni were going into full-time litigation.In fact it was found that most of the students hardly litigate in courts as it's hard to sustain on income during initial years of regular law practice under Indian conditions.
Moreover, the amount of fees being charged in the institution is too expensive, compared to the private law colleges of india, which makes it difficult for an ordinary indian student even to think about studying at NLSIU.
In such a situation, after investing so much of money into education, it is quite natural that the students chose a better paying job, than pursueing litigation.
<p>Many reports published by news journals like India Today point out to existence of formidable cartels formed by the alumni of NLSIU which alumni of other recent Law Schools find tough to crack especially among the top law firms and in house legal departments of companies.
