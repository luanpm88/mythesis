image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Criticism</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As stated by a former director, one of the principal objectives in establishing the NLSIU was to increase the quality of the <a>bar</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%However, it has been pointed out that most of those who graduate from NLSIU prefer a career in corporate litigation or as legal advisers to companies, instead of joining the bar.
nickname$$$@@@%%%While this has been attributed to the increased presence of multinational corporations in India, along with the low salaries paid by advocates, no changes seem to have been made to combat this problem.
established$$$@@@%%%This was intensified when <a>Clifford Chance</a> and the rest of the <a>Magic Circle</a>, <a>Silver Circle</a> law firms handed training contracts to twelve NLS students in 2006, which led to criticism by the Executive Council, including the Chief Justice, that not enough alumni were going into full-time litigation.In fact it was found that most of the students hardly litigate in courts as it's hard to sustain on income during initial years of regular law practice under Indian conditions.
established$$$@@@%%%Moreover, the amount of fees being charged in the institution is too expensive, compared to the private law colleges of india, which makes it difficult for an ordinary indian student even to think about studying at NLSIU.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Annual fee structure of NLSIU bangalore ranges somewhere between INR 1.5 to 1.7 lakhs, which is far expensive than even Engineering courses in india.
established$$$@@@%%%In such a situation, after investing so much of money into education, it is quite natural that the students chose a better paying job, than pursueing litigation.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Many reports published by news journals like India Today point out to existence of formidable cartels formed by the alumni of NLSIU which alumni of other recent Law Schools find tough to crack especially among the top law firms and in house legal departments of companies.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Its criticised particularly on the point that other Law Schools formed on similar format as the NLSIU but much later in time have been losing out because of the cartelisation by NLSIU alumni of major law firms and Corporate jobs.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Another major criticism among the lawyers about NLSIU is that corporates hire the graduates of NLSIU, just going by their brandname, many times ordinary law graduate would be paid 10 times lesser than an NLSIU graduate, for the same job.</p>
