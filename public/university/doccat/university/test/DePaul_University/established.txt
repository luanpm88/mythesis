<h2>History</h2>
1911 photograph of DePaul University in the <em>[[Chicago Daily News]]<em>]]</em> Originally named St.
Vincent&#x2019;s College, DePaul University was founded in 1898 by the <a>Congregation of the Mission</a> priests and brethren, known as the <a>Vincentians</a>.
Followers of 17th century French priest <a>Saint Vincent de Paul</a>, they founded the university to serve <a>Roman Catholic</a> children of immigrants.
<p>Student enrollment grew from 70 in 1898 to 200 in 1903 in what is now the Lincoln Park neighborhood of <a>Chicago</a>.
In that year, <a>James Quigley</a>, <a>Archbishop of Chicago</a>, announced plans to create a preparatory seminary, now <a>Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary</a>, for the archdiocese and allow the Jesuit Saint Ignatius College, now <a>Loyola University Chicago</a> to move its collegiate programs to the north side, threatening St. Vincent College&#x2019;s survival.
In response, the Vincentians re-chartered in 1907 as DePaul University, expressly offering all of its courses of study to men and women of any religious background.
DePaul began admitting women in 1911 and awarded degrees to its first female graduates in 1912.
It was one of the first Catholic universities to admit female students in a <a>co-educational</a> setting.</p>
<p>In 1912, DePaul established the School of Music and the College of Commerce, the latter becoming one of the oldest business schools in the nation.
In 1914, the College began offering courses in Chicago's Loop, the precursor of DePaul&#x2019;s second primary campus.
In 1915, the Illinois College of Law completed its affiliation with the university and became the <a>DePaul University College of Law</a>.
With the entry of the United States into <a>World War I</a> in 1918, DePaul formed a unit of the <a>US Army</a> <a>Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> and converted its College Theatre into <a>Army</a> barracks.<a>right|thumb|200px|DePaul
<p>Although finances were rocky, the university continued to grow and build in the 1920s.
The color blue, which signifies loyalty and was chosen in 1901 by a vote of the student body, was added to the name to create the &quot;Blue Demons&quot;.</p>
In 1938, the Department of <a>Elementary Education</a> was established, reportedly the only one in the <a>Midwest</a> and one of six in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
Bill</a>, which paid the tuition of veterans enrolled in college, turned the financial tide for DePaul.
Enrollment in 1945 skyrocketed to 8,857 students, twice as many as the previous year, and totaled more than 11,000 in 1948.
Although a <a>consulting firm</a> recommended relocating from its deteriorating Lincoln Park neighborhood to the suburbs, trustees voted to remain and support revitalization of the neighborhood.
<p>In 1942, DePaul named <a>Ray Meyer</a> as head basketball coach.
Meyer coached for DePaul until he retired in 1984, leading the 1945 team to the championship of the <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> and earning numerous honors, including election to the <a>Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</a> in 1979, the fourth active coach to be so honored.
<p>In 1954, DePaul adopted its current armorial seal with <a>coat of arms</a> and motto: &quot;Viam sapientiae monstrabo tibi&quot; (&quot;I will show you the way of wisdom&quot;, Proverbs, IV, 11).
In 1955, the Frank J. Lewis Foundation donated the 18-story Kimball Building, rechristened the Lewis Center, at 25 East Jackson Boulevard, to the university.
The building, still used today, was the hub of the Loop campus until 1993, when the DePaul Center opened at 1 East Jackson Boulevard (at State Street).
<p>In 1972, DePaul created the School for New Learning, one of the first colleges in the nation dedicated to serving adult students.
In 1976 and 1977, the university acquired the land and buildings of the <a>McCormick Theological Seminary</a>, which increased its presence in Lincoln Park.
In 1978, DePaul acquired the 47-year-old Goodman School of Drama from the <a>Goodman Theatre</a> and transformed it into The Theatre School.
<p>Following renovations in the 1980s and expansion of academic programs to promote research and social engagement, the university launched a six-year strategic plan in 1989.
The plan included raising the national profile, expanding enrollment from 13,500 to 18,500 and completing an extensive building campaign at the Loop and Lincoln Park campuses.
Major construction included renovation of the DePaul Center in 1993 and acquisition of the Blackstone Theatre, rechristened the Merle Reskin, in 1992.
At Lincoln Park, projects included the John T. Richardson Library, completed in 1992, several new <a>residence halls</a> and the quadrangle.
Under the next six-year strategic plan, the university expanded enrollment to 23,000 students, reclaiming its status as the nation&#x2019;s largest Catholic university while maintaining admission standards, increasing diversity (currently, one third of the student population is of color) and maintaining access for first-generation college students and those from <a>low-income</a> circumstances (about one-fourth of incoming freshmen qualify for Pell grants for low-income families).
Additional new facilities included the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North) in 1999, the Ray Meyer Fitness and Recreation Center in 1999, the Student Center in 2001 and the Sullivan Athletic Center in 2000, and the Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) in 2009.
A privately owned and operated building, 1237 West, was built one block off campus as a student apartment community for over 580 DePaul University students with retail businesses on the first floor.
DePaul was one of seven finalists for &#x201c;College of the Year&#x201d; honors given by <a><em>Time</em></a> magazine and the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> in 1998.
DePaul got the #1 ranking for Great College Town by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> in 2008.</p>
<p>DePaul entered into a merger with <a>Barat College</a> in 2001, from which it withdrew in 2005 after continued low enrollment and rising maintenance costs made the campus unviable.
The former <a>Barat College</a> had its final graduation on June 11, 2005 and was closed as of June 30, 2005.
It sold the grounds of the 147-year-old college to a condominium developer Barat Woods LLC, who pledged to maintain the historic Old Main building, yet demolished the Thabor Wing with its Italianate style Sacred Heart Chapel.
<p><a>thumb|200px|Completed in 1992, Richardson Library faces the Quad in the heart of DePaul University's Lincoln Park Campus.</a></p>
The university has suburban campuses in <a>Naperville</a>, <a>Oak Forest</a>, <a>O'Hare</a> and <a>Rolling Meadows</a>.
Located on  in <a>Chicago's</a> historic Lincoln Park neighborhood, this campus offers a traditional university environment.
Approximately 2,400 students live on campus in DePaul's fifteen residence halls.
<p>The Lincoln Park Campus is home to the College of <a>Liberal Arts</a> and Sciences, the College of <a>Communication</a>, The Theatre School, the School of Music, the School of Education, and the John T. Richardson Library.
Opened in 1992, the library features study and small-group spaces, an automated reference center, and a high-tech Resource Center for <a>Career Development</a>.</p>
Other recent additions include the <a>Sullivan Athletic Center</a>, containing McGrath Arena, and the <a>Ray Meyer</a> Fitness and Recreation Center.
The Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) is a new four-story building completed in January 2009, it is connected to the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North).
This expansion was completed in the 1970s when McCormick moved its campus to the Hyde Park neighborhood.
The McCormick Row Houses along the south side of Fullerton Avenue east of the elevated station, though now privately owned, were originally constructed for the Seminary.
Also, until its destruction in 2006, the gothic architecture Hayes-Healy Athletic Center adjacent to the CTA Fullerton 'L' Station (similar in design to the still-present Cortelyou Commons next to Wish Field at Cacciatore Stadium) was also part of the Seminary campus.
The gymnasium was demolished as part of the renovation/expansion of the Fullerton 'L' stop, despite being on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
It is close to the <a>stock exchange</a>s, financial district, and the <a>Art Institute of Chicago</a>.
The DePaul Center (DPC), an 11-story building fully renovated in 1993 to include modern classrooms, high-tech student services and a business library, is located in the building that formerly housed the  A. M. Rothschild &amp; Company Store and the Goldblatt's Department Store.
It is home to the College of Commerce.
In November 2000, the <a>Urban Land Institute</a> presented DPC with its Award for Excellence for Rehabilitation.
<p>The <a>College of Law</a> is based in the Lewis Center and O'Malley Place at the southwest corner of Wabash and Jackson.
Kitty-corner across the street is the <a>College of Computing and Digital Media</a>.
In 2008, DePaul purchased the 18-story 14 East Jackson Boulevard Building at State and Jackson, formerly the Lytton Building, across the street from the DePaul Center.
The College of <a>Communication</a>, the <a>School for New Learning</a> and the <a>School of Public Service</a> were the first academic tenants of 14 East Jackson Boulevard, now the Richard M. and Maggie C. Daley Building.</p>
<p>DePaul partnered with <a>Roosevelt University</a> and <a>Columbia College Chicago</a> to build the University Center of Chicago, an 18-story residence hall two blocks south of DPC housing 1,700 students, which opened in 2004 at the intersection of State and Congress Streets.
<a>Robert Morris University</a> later joined and also houses students in the University Center of Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>Suburban Campuses</strong> DePaul has suburban campuses in <a>Rolling Meadows</a>, <a>O'Hare</a>, <a>Oak Forest</a> and <a>Naperville</a>.
<p> <a>thumb|right|Blue Demon primary logo</a>  DePaul competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> and is a member of the <a>Big East Conference</a>.
The school's only national championship came in 1945 after winning the National Invitation Tournament (NIT).
The team has played at the <a>Allstate Arena</a> since 1980.</p>
<p>We will gather&lt;br /&gt; 'Neath your banner,&lt;br /&gt; 'Neath the scarlet and the blue,&lt;br /&gt; While in song we&lt;br /&gt; Tell your praises&lt;br /&gt; Praises for old DePaul U&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Let the battle&lt;br /&gt; wage and threaten&lt;br /&gt; Yours the victory to claim;&lt;br /&gt; As we fight beneath your standard: Proud!&lt;br /&gt; Exulting in your name.&lt;br
<li>In 1967, the Black Student Union (BSU) was formed.
In 1969, while in ongoing negotiations with DePaul administrators, members of the group occupied a campus building for two days and led several related rallies.
The actions helped bring concerns of <a>black</a> students, and later those of <a>Latino</a>, <a>Muslim</a> and other student groups, to the fore.
<li>In recent years, DePaul has been the target of criticism, for different reasons, by various <a>conservative</a> and free speech organizations, including some that oppose the university's inclusive Catholic ethos.
The most active of the free speech groups is <a>FIRE</a>, a <a>free speech</a> <a>civil rights</a> <a>advocacy group</a>.
FIRE gave the President of the University, <a>Dennis H. Holtschneider</a>, its award for the worst protector of Free Speech by a university president.
FIRE and others have criticized the university's decision to suspend without public hearing and not renew the contract of part-time faculty member <a>Thomas E. Klocek</a> in September 2004 for comments made to and behaviour towards <a>Palestinian</a> students concerning the <a>conflict</a> with <a>Israel</a>.
The event resulted in FIRE's harsh criticism of the university's level of support for open discussion and debate.
University supporters maintain that the issue was not Klocek's views, but the manner in which he expressed them.
The conflict happened in the student union and campus security was called.</li>
<li>On May 24, 2006, the university sponsored a forum on <a>free speech</a> for students, faculty and interested community members, which featured <a>Randall Kennedy</a> of <a>Harvard Law School</a> and Ann Franke of United Educators in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, and included a discussion between the speakers and members of the audience.</li>
<li>The university limited fliers protesting a visit of <a>Ward Churchill</a>, declaring them &quot;propaganda&quot;.
Churchill's visit resulted in a bomb threat that prompted the university to limit attendance at the event.</p>
<li>In June 2007, <a>Norman Finkelstein</a>, an outspoken political science professor, was denied tenure.
DePaul's president, Rev. <a>Dennis Holtschneider</a>, denies that the outside pressure affected the university's position, saying <em>&quot;This attention was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case.&quot;</em>
Finkelstein's supporters claim he was denied tenure due to his writings on the <a>Holocaust</a> and on the state of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
On September 5, 2007, Finkelstein resigned after he and the university reached a settlement; they released a joint statement.</li>
<li>In June 2009, the university removed the dean of the <a>College of Law</a>, Glen Weissenberger.
The recommendation to remove Dean Weissenberger was made by DePaul's provost, Helmut Epp, who stated in an e-mail to College of Law faculty and staff that &quot;the working relationship between the dean and the administration had deteriorated to the point where it had become difficult to accomplish the college&#x2019;s work.&quot;
Weissenberger had recently reported to the <a>American Bar Association</a> that DePaul's administration had failed to redistribute law school tuition income appropriately, in violation of ABA accreditation rules.
Some DePaul faculty and students, as well as several independent observers in the law school community, have speculated that Weissenberger's removal was directly related to his report to the ABA.
