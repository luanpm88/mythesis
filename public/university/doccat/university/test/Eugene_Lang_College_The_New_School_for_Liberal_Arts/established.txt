<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts was founded as the Freshman Year Program at <a>The New School</a> in 1972 as a pre-college program for <a>high school</a> graduates.
Three years later, in 1975, the Freshman Year Program was expanded to a full undergraduate program and renamed The Seminar College.
In 1985, following a generous donation by well-known <a>philanthropist</a> and educational visionary <a>Eugene Lang</a> and his wife Theresa, the school was renamed Eugene Lang College.
<p>In 2005, the phrase &quot;The New School&quot; was inserted into the name of each division of <a>The New School</a> as part of a unification strategy initiated by the University's President Bob Kerrey; thus, Eugene Lang College was renamed <strong>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts</strong>; students and faculty refer to it as &quot;Lang.&quot;</p>
