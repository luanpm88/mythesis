established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On April 9, 1953, the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a community college in Auburn under the sponsorship of the Auburn City School District.
established$$$@@@%%%Auburn Community College opened its doors the following September in the former James Street Elementary School.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the first community college developed entirely after the establishment of SUNY.
established$$$@@@%%%When Cayuga County assumed sponsorship for the College in July 1975, the name was officially changed to Cayuga County Community College.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sixty-nine students formed the first freshman class.
established$$$@@@%%%They joined acting president Charles G. Hetherington, Ph.D., and the charter faculty in ushering in a new era of higher education for Central New York.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>To accommodate a rising student population, the College moved in 1959 to the current Auburn campus on Franklin Street in the city of Auburn.
established$$$@@@%%%Later construction added a cluster of facilities around the original classroom building, now known as the main building: the library (1964), the technology building (1970), the bookstore (1971), Spartan Hall (1980), and the nature center (1983).</p>
