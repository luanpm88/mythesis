established$$$@@@%%%<p>During his time at Plymouth and Scituate, Chauncy got into a heated debate with the religious and secular leaders of the Plymouth Colony over the issue of <a>baptism</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Chauncy taught that only baptism by full immersion was valid, while the Separatist Elders taught that sprinkling water over the body was just as valid.
established$$$@@@%%%The sprinkling method of baptism was much preferred in <a>New England</a> due to its cooler and harsher climate.
established$$$@@@%%%The religious leaders of the <a>Plymouth Colony</a> held public debates, trying to convince Chauncy to change his views.
established$$$@@@%%%When Chauncy still did not change his views, the Pilgrim leaders wrote to congregations in <a>Boston</a> and <a>New Haven</a> soliciting their views, and all the congregations wrote back that both forms of baptism were valid.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Still, Chauncy did not change his teachings.
former_names$$$@@@%%%It was because of this issue that Chauncy left Plymouth for Scituate in 1641.
established$$$@@@%%%A year after arriving in Scituate, Chauncy had a chance to practice what he preached, when he publicly baptized his twin sons by full immersion.
established$$$@@@%%%The plan backfired when one of his sons passed out due to being dunked in the water.
established$$$@@@%%%The mother of the child who was supposed be baptized at the same event refused to let it happen, and according to <a>John Winthrop</a>, got a hold of Chauncy and &quot;near pulled him into the water&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%When Chauncy was hired to be President of Harvard, he had to promise the leaders in Boston that he would keep his views on baptism quiet.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>His great-grandson was also named <a>Charles Chauncy (1705&#x2013;1787)</a>, minister of the First Church (Congregational) of Boston 1727&#x2013;1787, an Old-Light opponent of <a>Jonathan Edwards</a> and the New Light ministers of the <a>Great Awakening</a>, and a precursor of <a>Unitarianism</a>.</p>
