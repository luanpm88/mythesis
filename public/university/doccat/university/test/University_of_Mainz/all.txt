established$$$@@@%%%The <strong>Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz</strong> () is a <a>university</a> in <a>Mainz</a>, <a>Rhineland Palatinate</a>, <a>Germany</a>, named after the printer <a>Johannes Gutenberg</a>.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%With approximately 35,000 students (2007) in about 150 schools and clinics, it is among the top ten largest universities in Germany.
established$$$@@@%%%Starting on 1 January 2005 the university was reorganized into 11 faculties of study.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first University of Mainz goes back to the <a>Archbishop of Mainz</a>, Prince-elector and Reichserzkanzler <a>Adolf II von Nassau</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time, establishing a university required papal approval and Adolf II initiated the approval process during his time in office.
established$$$@@@%%%The university, however, was first opened in 1477 by Adolf's successor to the bishopric, <a>Diether von Isenburg</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1784 the University was opened up for Protestants and Jews (curator Anselm Franz von Betzel).
type$$$@@@%%%It fast became one of the largest Catholic universities in Europe with ten chairs in theology alone.
established$$$@@@%%%In the confusion after the establishment of the <a>Mainz Republic</a> of 1792 and its subsequent <a>recapture</a> by the <a>Prussia</a>ns, academic activity came to a gradual standstill.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1798 the university became active again under French governance, and lectures in the department of medicine took place until 1823.
established$$$@@@%%%Only the faculty of theology continued teaching during the 19th century, albeit as a theological Seminary (since 1877 &quot;College of Philosophy and Theology&quot;).

established$$$@@@%%%The current Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz was founded in 1946 by the <a>French occupying power</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In a decree on 1 March the French military government implied that the University of Mainz would continue to exist: the University shall be &quot;enabled to resume its function&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The remains of <a>anti-aircraft warfare</a> barracks erected in 1938 after the <a>remilitarization of the Rhineland</a> during the <a>Third Reich</a> served as the university's first buildings and are still in use today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The continuation of academic activity between the old university and Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, in spite of an interruption spanning over 100 years, is contested.
established$$$@@@%%%During the time up to its reopening only a <a>seminary</a> and <a>midwifery</a> college survived.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1972, the effect of the <a>1968 student protests</a> began to take a toll on the University's structure.
established$$$@@@%%%The departments (Fakultaeten) were dismantled and the University was organized into broad fields of study (Fachbereiche).
established$$$@@@%%%Finally in 1974 Peter Schneider was elected as the first president of what was now a &quot;constituted group-university&quot; institute of higher education.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1990 <a>J&#x00fc;rgen Z&#x00f6;llner</a> became University President yet spent only a year in the position after he was appointed Minister for &quot;Science and Advanced Education&quot; for the State of Rhineland-Palatinate.
established$$$@@@%%%As the coordinator for the SPD's higher education policy, this furloughed professor from the Institute for Physiological Chemistry played a decisive role in the SPD's higher education policy and in the development of Study Accounts.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Today</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Today the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz has approximately 35,000 students () and consists of over 150 institutions and clinics.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The range of studies is comprehensive; the university lacks some technical studies, <a>veterinary medicine</a> and <a>nutrition</a> science.
established$$$@@@%%%One can nonetheless study History of books, <a>athletics</a>, <a>music</a>, <a>visual arts</a>, <a>theatre</a>, and <a>film</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Mainz does not currently levy fees or tuition (<em>Studiengeb&#x00fc;hren</em>) for a regular course of study.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Senior citizen students, auditing students, and certain postgraduate students may be subject to fees.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The Ministry for Science and Advanced Education introduced &quot;study accounts&quot; (<em>Studienkonten</em>) that were developed jointly with Prof. Zoellner.
established$$$@@@%%%During the transition period, overdrafts on the account would incur a flat-rate charge of 650 Euro for every overdrawn semester.
established$$$@@@%%%The Study Accounts allow for a free-of-charge initial course of study as long as it does not exceed 1.75 times the standard period of study.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In a second step the accounts will soon be charged according to time actually used.
established$$$@@@%%%It is still contested as to whether the enormous administrative burden will lead to an actual improvement of academic conditions.
established$$$@@@%%%**Measurable success is similar by the introduction of long-term tuition in other federal states and its effect on the decline of nominally enrolled students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Since 2008 the JGU is home of the editorial office of <a>Management International Review</a>.</p>
