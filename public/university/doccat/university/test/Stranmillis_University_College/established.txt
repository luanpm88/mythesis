<p><strong>Stranmillis University College</strong> () is a <a>university college</a> of <a>Queen's University Belfast</a>.
The institution is located on the Stranmillis Road in <a>Belfast</a>, and has approximately 700 students today and offers the <a>BEd</a>, <a>PGCE</a> and <a>TESOL</a>, as well as other courses.
The university's main building was designed by <a>Charles Lanyon</a> in 1858.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was established in 1922 to provide state-funded teacher training by the then newly created <a>Government</a> of <a>Northern Ireland</a> to ensure that there would be a <a>non-denominational</a> teacher training college within the new country after the <a>partition of Ireland</a>.
This status was undermined early in its existence, after a statement by <a>Roman Catholic</a> bishops to the effect that a graduate of the institution would not be allowed to teach in a <a>Catholic</a> <a>school</a> soon ensured that the institution became identified as a <a>Protestant</a>-only institution.
<p>The university college was associated with the university since 1968 when it became a college of the university and commenced offering the university's degrees.
The university college is financially and organisationally independent of the university.</p>
