established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was established in 1922 to provide state-funded teacher training by the then newly created <a>Government</a> of <a>Northern Ireland</a> to ensure that there would be a <a>non-denominational</a> teacher training college within the new country after the <a>partition of Ireland</a>.
