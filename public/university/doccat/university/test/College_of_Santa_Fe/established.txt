<p>   The <strong> Santa Fe University of Art and Design</strong> is an institution of Creative Arts  based in <a>Santa Fe</a>, <a>New Mexico</a>.
At its Santa&nbsp;Fe campus, the college offers a traditional full-time <a>undergraduate</a> program, as well as an evening and weekend program for local working adults.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The oldest chartered college in the State of New Mexico, Santa Fe University was founded in the <a>Lasallian</a> tradition of education, a <a>Roman Catholic</a> teaching order in which the schools are run by <a>laymen</a>.
The institution's first incarnation opened in 1859, as <strong>St.
It was run by four <a>Christian Brothers</a> as a preparatory school for boys, and it operated out of an <a>adobe</a> hut.
It was granted a charter for higher education in 1874, as the <strong>College of the Christian Brothers of New Mexico</strong>.
The college was heavily represented at the first constitutional convention of New Mexico, in 1910.
However, after World War I, the higher education program was dropped, and it was a dedicated preparatory school until after World War II.</p>
<p>The school reintroduced the college program, and assumed its modern form, in 1947.
In 1966, Saint Michael's College changed its name to the College of Santa Fe, and enrolled its first female students in that year.</p>
<p>The university has continued expanding since it became <a>co-educational</a>.
In 1980 it opened the evening-weekend program, with the intent of offering degree programs to adults who work every weekday.
In 1985 it was <a>accredited</a> to award the <a>Master of Business Administration</a>.
In 1986, after the closing of the <a>University of Albuquerque</a>, it opened its Albuquerque branch.</p>
It also began offering many new degrees, including a masters in education, and bachelor of arts in environmental science and conservation.
It also opened the <a>Contemporary Music</a> Program.</p>
<h2>Santa Fe University today</h2>
<p>The university is known for its diverse student body, tolerant values and the eclectic interests of its students, as well as it's recent bankruptcy, which put it in the state-wide spotlight.
The liberal values of the college are reflected in the selection of programs that the college itself, in its course catalog, names as its best: <a>performing arts</a>, <a>visual arts</a>, <a>moving image arts</a>, music, and <a>creative writing</a>.
Students from nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia enroll at Santa Fe University of Art and Design, with approximately 80% coming from outside of the state of New Mexico.</p>
The Visual Arts Center, completed in 1999, was designed by the internationally renowned architect Ricardo Legorreta.
The Visual Arts Center (VAC) is one of the most photographed buildings in Santa Fe.</p>
In fact, Santa Fe was the first (and now, one of two colleges) in the nation with a professional film studio on its campus (Garson Studios) which are attached to the collegiate program.
Several major motion pictures have been filmed in the college's sound stages, including <em><a>North Country</a></em>, <em><a>All the Pretty Horses</a></em>, <em><a>Employee of the Month</a></em>, <em><a>Young Guns</a></em>, <em><a>The Missing</a></em>, <em><a>No Country for Old Men</a></em>, <em><a>Brothers</a></em>, <em><a>Legion</a></em> and <em><a>True Grit</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Contemporary Music Program includes traditional training in <a>music history</a>, <a>music theory</a>, <a>singing</a>, keyboard, and the student's individual instrument, but also involves training in <a>music technology</a> and <a>recording</a>, <a>world music</a>, and auditory theory.
The world music opportunities at the college are excellent for its size, having instruction in the African drum the <a>djembe</a>, the <a>Java</a>nese <a>Gamelan</a>, and <a>Balkan</a> and <a>Middle Eastern music</a>.
The department has a strong guitarist presence, in the students and <a>faculty</a>, and offers instruction in guitar styles such as <a>flamenco</a>, jazz, rock, <a>blues</a>, and <a>classical</a>.
<h2>CSF Era to the Beginning of SFUAD</h2>
<p>In 2008, the <a>Chronicle of Higher Education</a> reported that the institution nearly declared a financial exigency, allowing the school to fire tenured professors to save the institution from bankruptcy.
During the summer of 2008, the College of Santa Fe announced a possible partnership with Laureate Education Inc.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2008 the President of the College of Santa Fe announced that, unable to assume the debt of the college, Laureate pulled out of possible partnership with CSF.
The college began working with <a>New Mexico Highlands University</a>, whose regents approved taking over the private College of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>As of January 13, 2009, the deal needed to be approved by the Commission on Higher Learning and the New Mexico State Legislature, which must agree to additional funds.
On January 12, 2009, the Highlands University regents approved a letter of intent that outlines the process for taking over the financially strapped Santa Fe school.
The College of Santa Fe's trustees had already approved the letter.</p>
<p>After much student and local cooperation and efforts for over a year to save the College of Santa Fe as an institution of higher learning and liberal arts, the private college was slated to close at the end of the 2009 semester.
The bill was to be considered before the New Mexico State Senate Finance Committee.
After the end of session there was no concrete plan for the State of New Mexico to acquire the College of Santa Fe.
A press release on March 24, 2009 by the President of the College of Santa Fe, Stuart C. Kirk mentions the demise of college and that all operations will cease.
The college put together a teach-out plan with several other comparable institutions, so that students would have the option to finish their degree on time and to still receive a diploma from CSF.</p>
<p><strong>Governor Bill Richardson lends his support for CSF</strong> The Governor of the State of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, signed an executive order creating the College of Santa Fe Task Force during a visit to the campus.
The Task Force explored all options to save the financially troubled private college and report back to Governor Richardson by April 30, 2009.
&#x201c;The college is too important to the City of Santa Fe and the State of New Mexico for us to allow it to close its doors and this Task Force will look at all ways to prevent that from happening.&#x201d;
Governor Richardson selected his Deputy Chief of Staff and education adviser Dr. Bruce Perlman to chair the Task Force which is composed of education, state, community, and business leaders as well staff and students at the College of Santa Fe.
Task Force members held their first meeting immediately following the signing of the executive order.</p>
<p>On May 7, 2009 the college announced that it was in renewed talks with <a>Laureate Education</a>, discussing the possibility of an acquisition.
In July 2009, the College of Santa Fe's future was secured in a three party agreement between the City of Santa Fe, The New Mexico State Governor's Office and Laureate Education.
<p>It was announced on July 1, 2010 that <strong>College of Santa Fe</strong> would become <strong>Santa Fe University of Art and Design</strong> as of Aug. 30, the first day of classes for the fall semester.
Men's sports offered were <a>baseball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>soccer</a>, and <a>tennis</a>, while women's sports offered were <a>softball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>soccer</a>, and <a>tennis</a>.</p>
The center opened in November 2002 and was awarded the <a>USTA</a> Outstanding Tennis Facility Award in 2003.
With six indoor <a>Rebound Ace</a> courts, one stadium court (also Rebound Ace), seven outdoor courts, and a state-of-the-art lighting system, the Tennis Center is the premier tennis facility of Santa Fe.
<p>The College of Santa Fe competed as the Knights until the mid 1980's when the programs were discontinued.</p>
