country$$$@@@%%%&#x201c;While I am disappointed that the bill that would have allowed one of our state&#x2019;s universities to acquire the College of Santa Fe did not make it through the legislative session, I want to assure students, faculty and the community we are not giving up,&#x201d; Governor Bill Richardson said.
established$$$@@@%%%&#x201c;The college is too important to the City of Santa Fe and the State of New Mexico for us to allow it to close its doors and this Task Force will look at all ways to prevent that from happening.&#x201d;
