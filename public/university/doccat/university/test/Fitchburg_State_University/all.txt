established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|The State Normal School in Fitchburg</a>Fitchburg State University was founded as the <strong>State Normal School in Fitchburg</strong> in 1894 by the <a>state legislature</a>.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Its first President was John G. Thompson (President 1895&#x2013;1920).
established$$$@@@%%%Initially a secondary education school for women (coeducation arrived in 1911), the Normal School was not authorized to grant Bachelor degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920&#x2013;1927), and during Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's (1927&#x2013;1945) tenure.
mascot$$$@@@%%%In 1932, that authorization was extended to all academic disciplines in Education.
established$$$@@@%%%At the same time, the name was changed to <strong>State Teachers College at Fitchburg</strong>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's died while in office and was followed by Dr. William J. Sanders (1945&#x2013;1950) and  Ellis F. White (1950&#x2013;1953).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During Ralph H. Weston's (1953&#x2013;1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus.
established$$$@@@%%%That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to <strong>State College at Fitchburg</strong> and added degree programs outside of Education.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1965, the College's name evolved into <strong>Fitchburg State College</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%James J. Hammond (1963&#x2013;1975) and Dr. Vincent J. Mara (1975&#x2013;2003) were the next two presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.
established$$$@@@%%%More recently, a new west wing was added to the Mara compound.</p>
