<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The State Normal School in Fitchburg</a>Fitchburg State University was founded as the <strong>State Normal School in Fitchburg</strong> in 1894 by the <a>state legislature</a>.
Initially a secondary education school for women (coeducation arrived in 1911), the Normal School was not authorized to grant Bachelor degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920&#x2013;1927), and during Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's (1927&#x2013;1945) tenure.
At the same time, the name was changed to <strong>State Teachers College at Fitchburg</strong>.
<p>During Ralph H. Weston's (1953&#x2013;1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus.
That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to <strong>State College at Fitchburg</strong> and added degree programs outside of Education.
In 1965, the College's name evolved into <strong>Fitchburg State College</strong>.
James J. Hammond (1963&#x2013;1975) and Dr. Vincent J. Mara (1975&#x2013;2003) were the next two presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.
More recently, a new west wing was added to the Mara compound.</p>
<p>In the past five years, since Robert V. Antonucci (2003&#x2013;present) became president, the college has focused on enhancing its buildings and grounds as well as its programs.
The school has focused on renovations and rehabilitation of underused buildings and areas as opposed to extensive building, even though there has been some.
A new science building and renovation of the Condike Science building is in the works with construction slated to begin in 2011.</p>
Twenty years later, its first graduate programs were established.
In July 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to grant Fitchburg state university status and change its name to <strong>Fitchburg State University</strong>.
The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.</p>
<li><strong>Thompson Hall</strong>, built in 1896, was the college's original building.
It is now primarily a classroom building.
It is home to the Nursing Department and its laboratories, including a 10-bed mock hospital.
When the Hammond Campus Center was built, a tunnel that ran to the former Palmer House dormitory was made into a thoroughfare between the second level of the new building and the basement of Thompson Hall.</li>
<li><strong>Edgerly Hall</strong>, when built, was used as &#x201c;an eighth-grade model and practice school,&#x201d; which made it one of the first <a>junior high schools</a> in America.
It is now home to the <a>computer science</a> department.</li>
<li><strong>Percival Hall</strong> is directly across the Quad from Edgerly and is the home of the behavioral science department and classrooms.
<li>The <strong>Condike Science Building</strong> houses science classrooms, laboratories and departmental offices, as well as a 135-seat lecture hall.</li>
<li>The <strong>Conlon Arts Building</strong> is actually two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway.
One building is home to the large <a>communications</a>/media and <a>industrial technology</a> departments and home to the school's <a>Information Technology</a> office.
The other part contains a 280-seat lecture hall, the offices of the fine arts faculty, as well as art studios and classrooms.</li>

<li><strong>Sanders Administration Building</strong> is the administrative office building on campus.
It presents <a>music</a>, <a>dance</a>, and <a>theatrical performances</a>, writer series and talks, <a>film</a>s, workshops, and various lecture series.
<li><strong><a>Wallace Civic Center</a></strong> is made up of two ice rinks (the Gaetz Arena and the Landry Arena) and a <a>planetarium</a>.
Fitchburg State University acquired the Civic Center in August 2007 from the city of Fitchburg.
The planetarium fell into disrepair while owned by the city and the school is working on making it usable again.</li>
