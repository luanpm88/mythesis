<p>It used to be a two-year normal college, but it was elevated to a four-year comprehensive college or university in 2004 with the permission of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Hengshui Normal College was known as an example of mid-1980s medium densityarchitecture.
However, developments since mid-2003, including the construction of modern library facilities have had a significant impact on the layout and aesthetic impact of the original dormitory blocks.</p>
<p>The same 2003 development included the removal of the original retail facilities in the garden in front of the rear dining block, leading to impairment of chilled snack availability, and in particular a lack of pay-per-shot photographic services.</p>
<p>The entrance of the university is colonnade and includes a fountain.</p>
