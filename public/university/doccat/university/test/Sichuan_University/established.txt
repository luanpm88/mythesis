<h2>History</h2>
In 1994, the original Sichuan University merged with the Chengdu University of Science and Technology (CUST), a national university under <a>the Ministry of Education</a>.
The merged university was shortly known by the name of Sichuan Union University.
In 2000, Sichuan University merged with West China University of Medical Science (WCUMS), a university under the State <a>Ministry of Health</a>, and became &quot;Sichuan University&quot;.
<p>The original Sichuan University was one of the earliest institutions of <a>higher education in China</a>, with a history dating back to <em>Sichuan Zhong-Xi Xuetang</em> (Sichuan Chinese and Western School), established in 1896.
The Xuetang was in a direct line of succession with <em>Jinjiang Shuyuan</em> and <em>Zunjing Shuyuan</em>, institutions of <a>Chinese classic</a>al learning, established in 1704 and 1875, respectively.
By 1949, Sichuan University had developed into the biggest national multidisciplinary university with branches in: <a>literature</a>, <a>science</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, <a>law</a>, and <a>teacher training</a>.
<p><a>right|thumb|400px|The Old Gate at SCU</a> In 1949, upon the nationwide adjustment of universities and colleges, spurred by the <a>Chinese revolution</a>, Sichuan University added courses on literature, <a>historiography</a>, <a>religion</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>physics</a>, <a>biology</a>, and other subjects.
In 1958, it was the only university outside <a>Beijing</a> directly administerd by the <a>Central Government</a>.</p>
<p>The former Chengdu University of Science and Technology was established as the Chengdu Engineering College in 1954 as the result of the nation-wide college and department adjustment.
It specialized in  <a>chemical engineering</a>, <a>hydroelectricity</a>, <a>mechanics</a>, <a>textiles</a>, and <a>light industry</a>.
<p>The former West China University of Medical Science was originally built as a private medical school, once known as Huaxi Xiehe College (West China Union College).
It was established in 1910 by five Christian missionary groups from the <a>U.S.</a>, <a>UK</a> and <a>Canada</a>, with offered courses in stomatology, biomedicine, basic medicine and clinical medicine.
<p><a>Zhang Lan</a>, <a>social activist</a>, educationist, and former Vice-Chairman of the <a>Chinese Central Government</a>, and <a>Wu Yuzhang</a>, revolutionary and educationist, were once the President of the university.
Other notable people who studied at SCU include Marshal <a>Zhu De</a>, one of the founding fathers of the <a>People's Republic of China</a> and the <a>People's Liberation Army</a>, <a>Guo Moruo</a>, a literary expert and previous president of <a>Chinese Academy of Science</a>, and <a>Ba Jin</a>, a well-known Chinese author.</p>
<p>Sichuan University has a current total staff of 11,357, among which 1,323 are <a>professor</a>s, 2,345 <a>associate professors</a>, 10 academicians of <a>Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> and <a>Chinese Academy of Engineering</a>, 434 tutors of doctoral students, and 17 members of the Academic Degrees Committee and the Discipline Appraisal Group under the <a>State Council</a>.
<p>In 2002, the university's state and central government funding ranked fifth among Chinese universities; it was ranked seventh for the number of publications and eleventh for publications included in SCI.
<p>The University has four libraries containing, in total, about 5.5 million volumes.
The National University Scientific and Technological Projects and Achievements Consulting Center, and Center for Medical Literature Retrieval in Southwest China are served by the SCU library as well.
The University Museum is the only one of its kind in China with a comprehensive collection of over 40,000 cultural relics, and over 600,000 animal and plant specimens, ranking first in its holdings among the others in China.
The older <em>Wangjiang</em> campus (&#x671b;&#x6c5f;) is in central Chendu, adjacent to the Jinjiang River and its <a>tributary</a> the Jiang'an River.
The nearby <em>Huaxi</em> (&#x534e;&#x897f;) Campus is the site of the medical school.
The <em>Jiang'an</em> (&#x6c5f;&#x5b89;) Campus was built in 2003  in <a>Shuangliu County</a> about 12.5&nbsp;km away from the older campuses; it covers an area of about 4.7&nbsp;km&#x00b2; and has total floorage of more than 2.7 million m&#x00b2;.</p>
<li><a>College of Physical Science and Technology</a></li>
<p>The College of Physical Science and Technology is located in Wangjiang Campus, which is one of the most biggest and eldest college in the university.
The Department of Physics was established in the year 1928, which means have a history more than 80 years.
Physics is studied in the western part of Wangjiang Campus, and the Nuclear Technology is carried out in the eastern part, in NO.1 Science Building.
There're also professor focus on the study of Optics, Condense Matter, Theory.
Condense Matter physics was famous for its research on mesoscopic electron transportation lab.
And the leader of the laboratory, academician of Chinese Engineering Academy Prof. Jie Gao, now focus on the transportation of single electron with the aim of finding novelty ways to measure tiny electrical current.

In 1928 the college of Medicine and dentistry formed the joint college of medicine and dentistry of WCUU.
It was renamed as Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan Medical College in 1953.
In 1985, it was granted a name as the College of Stomatology, West China University of Medical Sciences and was changed into West China College of Stomatology, Sichuan University in 2000.</li>
