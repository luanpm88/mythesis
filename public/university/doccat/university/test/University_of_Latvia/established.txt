<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Latvia named at that time &quot;The Latvia Higher School&quot; was founded on September 28, 1919 on the basis of the former Riga Polytechnic (founded in 1862).
In 1923, this school received its now resumed name - the University of Latvia (Universitas Latviensis).</p>

<p>In the pre-war years, it was possible to gain higher academic education not only at the University of Latvia but also at the <a>Conservatoire of Latvia</a> and <a>Academy of Arts</a>.
