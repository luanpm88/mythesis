<p>The <strong>Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama</strong> (<strong>RSAMD</strong>) is a <a>conservatoire</a> of <a>music</a>, <a>drama</a>, and <a>dance</a> in the centre of <a>Glasgow</a>, <a>Scotland</a>.
Founded in 1845 as the <strong>Glasgow Educational Association</strong>, today it is a leading cultural institution in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, and the busiest performing arts venue in <a>Scotland</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>RSAMD has occupied its current purpose-built building on Renfrew Street in <a>Glasgow</a> since 1988.
Primarily, it began with the establishment of the <strong>Glasgow Educational Association</strong> in 1845, which formed to provide courses in competition with the <a>University of Glasgow</a>.
The Association later became the <strong>Glasgow Commercial College</strong>, and this in turn became part of the <strong>Glasgow Athenaeum</strong> in 1847.
The Glasgow Athenaeum provided training in commercial skills, literature, languages, sciences, mathematics and music.
<a>Charles Dickens</a> gave its inaugural speech, in which he stated that he regarded the Glasgow Athenaeum as &quot;...an educational example and encouragement to the rest of Scotland&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1888, the commercial teaching of the Glasgow Athenaeum separated to form the <strong>Athenaeum Commercial College</strong>, which, after several rebrandings and a merger, became the <a>University of Strathclyde</a> in 1964.
In 1890 the non-commercial teaching side of the Glasgow Athenaeum became the <strong>Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music</strong>, which in turn became the <strong>Scottish National Academy of Music</strong> in 1929, which, in 1944, became the <strong>Royal Scottish Academy of Music</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1950 the Royal Scottish Academy of Music established a <a>drama</a> department called the <strong>Glasgow College of Dramatic Art</strong>.
It became the first <a>UK</a> <a>drama school</a> to contain a full, broadcast-specification <a>television studio</a> in 1962.
In 1968 the Royal Scottish Academy of Music changed its name to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and introduced its first degree courses, which were validated by the <a>University of Glasgow</a>.
In 1993 RSAMD became the first conservatoire in the United Kingdom to be granted its own degree-awarding powers.</p>
RSAMD is a member of the <a>Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music</a>.</p>
<p>RSAMD has a range of facilities, including several performance spaces: the Guinness Room, the Academy Concert Hall, the Chandler Studio Theatre, the New Athenaeum Theatre, and the Alexander Gibson Opera Studio (built in 1998).
<p>In 2008 the RSAMD fitted part of its main performing space, the New Athenaeum Theatre, with a <a>Stage Technologies</a> automated flying system.
RSAMD became the first educational establishment in the UK to offer Stage Automation Training as part of the curriculum.</p>
