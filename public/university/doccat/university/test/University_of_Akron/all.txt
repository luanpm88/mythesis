principal$$$@@@%%%<h3>Buchtel College</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1867, at the annual Convention of the <a>Universalist Church</a> of the state of Ohio, the Committee on Education expressed an interest in founding a college compatible with Universalist religious principles.
established$$$@@@%%%It was announced that the location would be given to those who could find an appropriate location and also supply $60,000 for the college.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>John R. Buchtel</a>, a prominent Akron businessman and Universalist, promptly contributed $25,000 to the endowment fund and $6,000 to the building fund.
established$$$@@@%%%This led other Akronites to donate, setting the goal and securing Akron as the location for Buchtel College, named after its greatest supporter.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%John R. Buchtel would continue to be the college's most significant contributor, giving $500,000 over his lifetime, approximately equivalent to $9 million today.
established$$$@@@%%%When the university opened for business in 1872 it was a single building campus, housed in what is now known as &quot;Old Buchtel.&quot;
type$$$@@@%%%<a>George Washington Crouse</a> donated $10,000 of the $20,000 needed to build a new gymnasium, completed in 1888.
