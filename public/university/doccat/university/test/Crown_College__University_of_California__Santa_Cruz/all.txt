established$$$@@@%%%  <li><a>Kenneth V.

established$$$@@@%%%Use of this chemical prevents the premature falling of fruit and stimulates cut stems to grow abundant roots.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Because high concentrations of auxins are toxic to most plants, synthetic auxins are effective weed killers.
established$$$@@@%%%This research was used in the subsequent development of the Vietnam-era herbicide <a>Agent Orange</a>.</li>
