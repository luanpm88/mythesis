<p> <strong>Crown College</strong> is one of the <a>residential college</a>s that makes up the <a>University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, <a>USA</a>.</p>
Crown has a favorable reputation for academically-focused students, possibly due to both its reputation as a science college and its secluded location on the Santa Cruz campus.
Because of its strong academic roots, Crown College is regarded as one of the quieter colleges on the campus.
It is very close to Upper Campus, frequented by hikers and mountain bikers, and near where drum circles take place during full moons.</p>
<h2>History and campus</h2>
<p>Crown was founded in 1967 when the Chancellor <a>Dean E. McHenry</a> invited chemist <a>Kenneth V. Thimann</a> to come to <a>Santa Cruz</a> and head what would become Crown College and to build the science faculty at <a>UCSC</a>.
<p>Located on the upper northern side of campus by <a>Merrill College</a>, Crown also borders the newly constructed Colleges <a>Nine</a> and <a>Ten</a>.
<p>Because of its strong science-related roots and continuing tradition, all of the student residence buildings have science-related themes and names: <a>Gauss</a> House, <a>Galen</a> House, <a>Rutherford</a> House, <a>Harvey</a> and <a>Maxwell</a> Houses, <a>Leonardo</a> House, <a>Galileo</a> House, and <a>Descartes</a> House.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Crown College started the popular College game of <a>Humans vs Zombies</a> attracting up to one hundred students when they meet, this is also the location where the USSC zombie defense council will be formed.</p>
The average gender representation during the 2005-06 academic year was 42% female and 58% male.
Crown was the only college at UCSC with a predominantly male enrollment, with the whole campus having a 54% to 46% female majority.</p>

<li><a>Kenneth V. Thimann</a> &#x2013; Founding Provost notable for his research in biology; in 1934, obtained and isolated pure <a>auxin</a>, an important plant-growth hormone and, with several coworkers, proved that auxin promotes cell elongation, formation of roots, and growth of buds, discoveries that led to the development of a widely used synthetic auxin, <a>2,4-D</a>.
Use of this chemical prevents the premature falling of fruit and stimulates cut stems to grow abundant roots.
This research was used in the subsequent development of the Vietnam-era herbicide <a>Agent Orange</a>.</li>
