established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Viadrina European University</strong> (, hence its frequent appearance as &quot;<em>European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)</em>&quot; in English) is a <a>university</a> located at <a>Frankfurt (Oder)</a> in <a>Brandenburg</a>, <a>Germany</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It is also known as the <strong>University of Frankfurt (Oder)</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%The city is on the <a>Oder</a> River, which marks the border between Germany and <a>Poland</a>.
students$$$@@@%%%With 5,200 students &mdash; around 1,000 of whom come from Poland &mdash; and some 160 teaching staff, the Viadrina is one of Germany's smallest universities (only the <a>University of Erfurt</a> and <a>Jacobs University Bremen</a> have fewer students).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The word &quot;Viadrina,&quot; from <a>Latin</a>, means &quot;belonging to, or situated at, the Oder River&quot;:  it derives from <em>Viadra</em>, the Latin name for the Oder (the city of Frankfurt was known in Latin as Francofortum ad Viadrum).

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Historical Viadrina</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>Alma Mater Viadrina</strong> was founded in 1506 by <a>Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg</a>, as the principal university of Brandenburg.
established$$$@@@%%%It was organized into four faculties: law, theology, philosophy, and medicine.
established$$$@@@%%%The university enjoyed an excellent reputation in Brandenburg and the surrounding regions, and its graduates had high positions in administration, politics, law and the church.
established$$$@@@%%%One of its earliest chancellors, Bishop <a>Georg von Blumenthal</a> (1490-1550) was a vigorous opponent of the <a>Protestant Reformation</a> and did his utmost to expel <a>Lutherans</a> such as <a>Jodocus Willich</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In <a>1736</a> the eminent jurist <a>Johann Jakob Moser</a> was called to head the Faculty of Law at the university, but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by then King <a>Frederick William I of Prussia</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1811 the university of Frankfurt was moved to <a>Breslau (Wroc&#x0142;aw)</a> and merged with the <a>University of Breslau</a>, the <em>Leopoldina</em>, in order to be competitive with the newly founded <a>University of Berlin</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Some of the Viadrina professors did, however, accept positions in Berlin.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The old university building in Frankfurt was damaged in <a>World War II</a> and controversially demolished in the early 1960s.
