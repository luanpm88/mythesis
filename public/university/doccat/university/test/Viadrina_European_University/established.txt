<p><strong>Viadrina European University</strong> (, hence its frequent appearance as &quot;<em>European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)</em>&quot; in English) is a <a>university</a> located at <a>Frankfurt (Oder)</a> in <a>Brandenburg</a>, <a>Germany</a>.
It is also known as the <strong>University of Frankfurt (Oder)</strong>.
The city is on the <a>Oder</a> River, which marks the border between Germany and <a>Poland</a>.
<p>The word &quot;Viadrina,&quot; from <a>Latin</a>, means &quot;belonging to, or situated at, the Oder River&quot;:  it derives from <em>Viadra</em>, the Latin name for the Oder (the city of Frankfurt was known in Latin as Francofortum ad Viadrum).
<p>The <strong>Alma Mater Viadrina</strong> was founded in 1506 by <a>Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg</a>, as the principal university of Brandenburg.
It was organized into four faculties: law, theology, philosophy, and medicine.
The university enjoyed an excellent reputation in Brandenburg and the surrounding regions, and its graduates had high positions in administration, politics, law and the church.
One of its earliest chancellors, Bishop <a>Georg von Blumenthal</a> (1490-1550) was a vigorous opponent of the <a>Protestant Reformation</a> and did his utmost to expel <a>Lutherans</a> such as <a>Jodocus Willich</a>.</p>
<p>In <a>1736</a> the eminent jurist <a>Johann Jakob Moser</a> was called to head the Faculty of Law at the university, but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by then King <a>Frederick William I of Prussia</a>.
<p>In 1811 the university of Frankfurt was moved to <a>Breslau (Wroc&#x0142;aw)</a> and merged with the <a>University of Breslau</a>, the <em>Leopoldina</em>, in order to be competitive with the newly founded <a>University of Berlin</a>.
Some of the Viadrina professors did, however, accept positions in Berlin.</p>
<p>The old university building in Frankfurt was damaged in <a>World War II</a> and controversially demolished in the early 1960s.
<p>Famous students at the historical Viadrina included the brothers <a>Alexander</a> and <a>Wilhelm von Humboldt</a>, the philosopher <a>Ulrich von Hutten</a>, the musician <a>Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach</a>, the theologian and political leader <a>Thomas M&#x00fc;ntzer</a>, and the poet <a>Heinrich von Kleist</a>.</p>
<p>In 1991 the university was re-established as Viadrina European University.
A prime focus of the educational program is to attract students from throughout Europe in order to create a multi-national student body.
<p>Viadrina European University maintains close cooperation with <a>Adam Mickiewicz University</a> in <a>Pozna&#x0144;</a>, Poland.
The Institute is a substantial contributor to research on economies in transition.</p>
<p>The former president of the university, Professor <a>Gesine Schwan</a>, ran for <a>President of Germany</a> both in 2004 and 2009, being narrowly defeated by <a>Horst K&#x00f6;hler</a> twice.
Since 1 October 2008 the title of president of the university is held by former diplomat <a>Gunter Pleuger</a>.</p>
