image_name$$$@@@%%%<p></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Established in 1874 as the Department of Agriculture, the department became a college in 1888.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1904, eminent <a>botanist</a> and <a>horticulturist</a> <a>Liberty Hyde Bailey</a>, along with <a>New York State</a> farmers, convinced the <a>New York Legislature</a> to financially support the agriculture college at Cornell, a private <a>university</a> that had been established in 1865 as New York's <a>land-grant</a> institution.
established$$$@@@%%%Thus, it became a <a>statutory college</a>, and changed its name from the New York State College of Agriculture in 1904 to the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1971.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1898, the State Legislature established a separate <a>New York State College of Forestry at Cornell</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%However, the school ran into political controversy, and the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation in 1903.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1910, <a>Liberty Hyde Bailey</a>, the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.
established$$$@@@%%%At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named <a>Fernow Hall</a>.
free$$$@@@%%%That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources.
website$$$@@@%%%In 1927, Cornell established a  research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1900, the college began offering a reading course for farm women.
former_names$$$@@@%%%In 1907, the Department of Home Economics was created within college.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1919, the Department of Home Economics became a school within the Agriculture College.
established$$$@@@%%%Finally, in 1925, the Home Economics department became a separate college, although both colleges continued to work together to provide cooperative extension services.</p>
