<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumbnail|right|450px|Hartwell Hall</a> The College at Brockport opened as the Brockport Collegiate Institute in 1841, and later became the Brockport State Normal School in 1866.</p>
<p>The last Normal School class graduated in 1942 after which the school officially became a college, meaning it could grant the <a>bachelor's degree</a>.
(Normal School graduates received only a certificate of study when they finished, which entitled them to teach in the <a>New York</a> State schools.)
This enhancement of status was due in good part to the efforts of President Ernest Hartwell, who, like Malcolm MacVicar and many other <a>Brockport</a> figures, played a leading role in the education movements of the time.
Starting as Brockport State Teachers College, the new school was automatically included in the new SUNY system which was established in 1948.</p>
<p>The years after <a>World War II</a> were a time of tremendous growth for <a>higher education</a>, as thousands of veterans went to college on the <a>G.I.
Brockport began a period of expansion in that time that was unprecedented in the school's history.</p>
<p>When Donald Tower became president of the school in 1944, the entire campus was what's now called Hartwell Hall.
The sole purpose of the school was to train elementary school teachers.
The campus had expanded greatly, adding residence halls and a college union, and expanding across Kenyon Street and down Holley Street.
The purpose and organization of the College had also grown, as it evolved into a liberal arts college with a number of master's degree programs.
The first graduate degree was awarded in January 1950.
<p>In the early years of President Albert Brown (1965&#x2013;1981), the school's growth rate built to a height of activity, seeing the high-rise residence halls, library and other buildings rise up to make the campus that one sees today.
The school continued to evolve in the last years of the 20th century under the leadership of President John Van De Wetering (1981&#x2013;1997), who launched the MetroCenter, SUNY Brockport's classroom complex in downtown Rochester.
<p>From 1997 to 2004, under the leadership of <a>Paul Yu</a>&#x2014;working closely with faculty, staff and students&#x2014;SUNY Brockport achieved new levels of excellence and recognition, from acquiring the latest information technologies to improving campus communications to increasing admissions standards.
Noteworthy achievements included: an increase in average <a>SAT</a> scores from 1002 in 1998 to 1071 in 2004, increase in first-year retention rate from 71 percent in 1998 to 83 percent in 2004, and an increase in funded faculty research grants from $3.5 million in 1999 to $5.7 million in 2004.</p>
Dr. Halstead brings a range of leadership experience to SUNY Brockport including a seven-year term as president of <a>Mansfield University of Pennsylvania</a>, several vice president positions and post-doctoral work at <a>Harvard University</a>'s Institute of Educational Management.
In 1978, Dr. Albert W. Brown presented Soviet artist <a>Zurab Tsereteli</a> with an honorary certificate in recognition of his efforts to foster peace and understanding between people of the Soviet Union and the United States.
After accepting the invitation, Tsereteli learned about the Fifth International Summer Special Olympics Games, to be held here at SUNY Brockport in August 1979.
Drawing inspiration from his interest in young people, his concern for Special Olympics and the realization that the United Nations had proclaimed 1979 as the International Year of the Child, Tsereteli began his work.
Within a year, Tsereteli constructed two sculptures for the Soviet Government, which were then donated to SUNY Brockport in honor of the International Year of the Child and the International Special Olympics.
One of the pieces is located in front of the Allen Administration Building, and is titled &quot;<a>Prometheus</a>&quot; (The Greek god who gave fire to man).
The five pillars represent the five continents that would be represented at the Special Olympics Games in 1979.
The two bronze pieces, whose total weight is nearly 30 tons, were shipped overseas to the United States and then loaded into five trucks to be brought to SUNY Brockport.</p>

<p>BSG consists of the three traditional branches of government: legislative, judicial, and executive.
A 12-member student elected board of directors oversees the legislative operations of the government.
<p>The Judicial Branch consists of a 5-member student court of which a Chief Justice is elected from the membership.

<p>In 1988, SUNY Brockport held the first simulation of the European Union, <a>EuroSim</a>, which today has become a transatlantic organization with participants from around the globe.
<p>This group was started in the spring 2004 and created for the sole purpose of providing a place for students to gather together to play music.
Amber DeFazio, one of the club's members went on to win the title of Brockport Idol in 2007.</p>
While the effort to create the group was undertaken by brothers Allen and Jeff (insert correct name), it was later developed by Pete Burke, Josh Brusso, Nick Brusso, and Ricky Smith.</p>
Founded in 1991 as a response to the AIDS crisis and the fact that the college students affected by the crisis were being largely ignored, SOUL has been an active member of the Brockport community.
<p>In 2007, while producing their 8th Annual Drag Show, a documentary was created titled &quot;Drag Show: In The Making&quot; which focused on the process of producing a large scale event and included interviews with SOUL leadership about the organization.</p>
<p>The Allen Building was built in 1973 and named after <a>Gordon F. Allen</a> who was an education professor, dean and then acting president from 1964-65.</p>
<p>Allen Hall is affectionately referred to as the <em>&quot;power tower&quot;</em> and is used for both administrative and academic purposes.
It is home to the Office of the President, central administration, as well as some instructional classrooms.</p>
<p>Albert W. Brown (1965&#x2013;1981) presided over SUNY Brockport during a period of rapid change and expansion, as the college grew from 3,000 students to a record of 11,000 students.
The Faculty Office Building was one of the major construction projects completed during Brown&#x2019;s tenure.
Campus growth at that time included the addition of new library, office, academic, athletic and high-rise residence hall buildings.</p>
<p>The Albert W. Brown Building is connected by pedestrian bridge to the Drake Memorial Library and the Allen Administration building.
It houses offices for the deans and associate deans of the School of Letters and Sciences, School of Professions and School of Arts and Performance, as well as faculty offices for 15 academic departments.
The Albert W. Brown Building is home to an extensive art collection of paintings, sculpture and photographs on display throughout the building within its .</p>
<p>This Victorian era home was built in the 1860s and bought by the state in 1898 for use as a residence by the principal.
Before the house was bought, the principals had lived in an apartment in the school building.
David Smith was the first principal to live in the house, and the last was Donald Tower who retired in 1964.
In a collection of reminisences of the house published in the AlumNews in 1985 the following memories were shared.
Mrs. Clyde Walters, class of 1918, recalled her friendship with Principal Thompson's daughter Miriam and attending Miriam's wedding which was held in the house.
Mrs. Fletcher Garlock, granddaughter of Thompson, mentioned that she was born in the house and remembered roller-skating in the kitchen!
Both Wilbur McCormick '37 and Bruce Schlageter '47 recalled as undergraduates visiting with Dr. Hartwell in the house to chat about school affairs.
After 1964 the building was used for office space and other purposes until in 1976 the Alumni Association acquired the building.
<p>Benedict Hall was built in 1965 and named after Edgar Benedict (1905&#x2013;1990) who was a longtime member of the Board of Trustees (1945&#x2013;1962).
Benedict Hall, along with Gordon, Dobson, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students.
This three-story dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents.
<p>Bramley Hall was built in 1968 and named after Herbert Bramley (1867&#x2013;1945), a longtime member of the Board of Trustees from 1935&#x2013;1945, and a prominent local business person.
Bramley Hall, considered one of the high-rise dormitories along with Briggs, Perry, and Mortimer Halls, is home to upperclass students.
This dorm was designed to have four suites of six students on each floor.
The six students share three bedrooms, a living area, and a bathroom.</p>
<p>Briggs Hall was built in 1968 and named after Elizabeth Briggs (1885&#x2013;1965) who was a Campus School history teacher at Brockport from 1910-1943.

<p>Brockway Hall was built in 1966 and named after <a>Hiel Brockway</a>, a co-founder of <a>Brockport, New York</a> who in 1836 donated the land on which Hartwell Hall now stands.</p>
<p>Today, the Brockway building serves as a dining hall for student who live in the traditional style dormitories.
<p>Cooper Hall was built in 1965 and named after Charles Cooper, the head of the &quot;training&quot; school at Brockport from 1911-1936.</p>
<p>Cooper's background included Millersville State Normal in <a>Pennsylvania</a> and a bachelor's degree from <a>Bucknell University</a>, eventually supplemented by a master's from the Teacher's College at <a>Columbia University</a>.
Cooper was intensely interested in the Training School and the athletic program of the Normal School.</p>
<p>Cooper Hall was the home to the Campus School, and was designed with elementary students in mind.
However, the Campus School closed in 1981, and today the building serves many functions.
<p>Dailey Hall was built in 1967 and named after Vincent Dailey, a Brockport native and the Chairman of the <a>New York State Democratic Party</a> who played a decisive role in obtaining funds for the construction of Hartwell Hall.</p>
<p>Dailey Hall was constructed as one of three dining halls during the building boom of the late 1960s.
Its centralized location on campus made the building the logical choice for the primary computer facility, and smaller computer labs.
Staff in Cooper and Drake Library were consolidated into the new Dailey Hall facility.</p>
<p>Dobson Hall was built in 1965 and named after Thomas Dobson (1852&#x2013;1930) who served on the Board of Trustees from the 1890s until 1930.
Dobson was appointed Secretary for the Board of Trustees in 1892, as the successor to Daniel Holmes.
He was a druggist by occupation, served as Mayor of the Village and was extremely active in church affairs of St. Luke's and the Masons.
<p>Dobson Hall, along with Gordon, Benedict, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students.
This three story tall dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents.
<p>In the beginning the library was a little collection of books housed in a room open only a few hours per week, and was largely used by faculty for reference purposes.
It also included a textbook collection and the school's laboratory equipment.
As teacher training education became more sophisticated, so did the library.</p>
<p>In the last years of the 1890s, Jeanette Reynolds, who had been a secretary at the school, became the librarian.
In 1899 she cataloged the collection according to the then new Dewey Decimal system.
Affectionately remembered by alumni as &quot;Jenny Wren,&quot; she laid the foundations of a modern library.
The library she presided over was in the central part of the old Normal School building, and included such things as a &quot;pen writing room,&quot; for writing with the fountain pens of that era - only pencils were allowed in the library proper!</p>
<p>In Fall 1939 construction began on the building we know as Hartwell Hall, replacing the old Normal School building.
The library in Hartwell was on the second floor, in the center of the building.
From the 1940s on the school began to expand, beginning with the winning of teacher's college status in 1942, which called for the expansion of library collections and staff.
Hours were extended, and the tradition of library instruction which dated back to the era of &quot;Jenny Wren&quot; continued.</p>
<p>With the postwar expansion of the college, the library became terribly crowded and staff schedules actually had to be planned around the small number of available work areas.</p>
<p>In 1961 the college opened the first building dedicated exclusively as a library, Drake Memorial Library.
It was named after two unrelated college staff members, Bernard Drake and Ruth Drake.
Bernard Drake was an administrator, Education professor and the dean of students from 1936-1957.
He graduated from the Normal School at Fredonia and received his master's degree from Columbia.
Prior to his arrival at Brockport, he had been working toward his doctorate at Columbia.
Drake initiated a study on the existing structured curriculum of the college in 1948, which resulted in the offering of a greater selection of courses to students.</p>
<p>The name also pays homage to Ruth Drake, who was a member of the faculty for 31 years.
Ms. Drake was born in Evanston, Illinois and graduated from Wellesley College in 1926.
She entered Brockport as a Kindergarten instructor in 1928, and later earned her master's degree from Columbia in 1946, and a degree in Library Science from Western Reserve University.
After several years as the campus Kindergarten Critic, Ms. Drake became the Campus School Librarian until her retirement in 1959.</p>
<p>This new building would serve as the home of the library until 1974, when the library moved to its current location on the south side of campus next to Allen.
The old building, now named Rakov, serves as home to many of the school's enrollment and business offices.</p>
<p>Edwards Hall was built in 1968 and named after Aletta Edwards and William Edwards, no relation.
Aletta Edwards (?-1939) was an English professor and chair of the department from 1908-1934.
She graduated from the former State Normal School at Brockport and received her Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Syracuse University.
She received her master's degree at the University of Rochester and did advanced work toward her doctorate at the University of Wisconsin, and at Cambridge University, England.</p>
<p>William Edwards (1902&#x2013;1959) was chair of the Social Sciences Department from 1941-1959.
He was born in Court House, Ohio and attended both the University of Chicago and Ohio State, where he received his bachelor's and master's of history in the same year.
After doing graduate work at the University of Minnesota and Brookings Institute of Washington, DC, he returned to Ohio State for his Ph.D.
During his term at Brockport, Edwards did an exchange professorship with the University of Madras in India, where he taught politics.</p>
<p>Gordon Hall was built in 1966 and named after Ida and Luther Gordon.
The Gordon family was prominent locally and Ida Gordon (1854&#x2013;1946) was one of two women appointed to the Board of Trustees in 1917.
Luther Gordon (1822&#x2013;1881) was a successful business person who supported the school at a crucial financial point just after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Luther Gordon was a lumber dealer in the village, and a political force in the Republican Party.
Mr. Gordon, along with other town members, refused to pay the Normal School taxes, and he instituted a suit in the Supreme Court against the village for seizing lumber.
The court declared the village actions legal, and the tax was paid.
Yet afterwards, Mr. Gordon bought half the bonds issued to construct the new Normal building.</p>
<p>Gordon Hall, along with Benedict, Dobson, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students.
This three story tall dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents.
Gordon Hall currently offers a substance-free floor, 24 hour quiet floors, and a returning scholars' floor.</p>
<p>Harmon Hall was built in 1966 and named after George Harmon Jr. (1880-?), a local business person who, as leader of the &quot;Committee on One Hundred,&quot; headed the fight of the later 1930s to get a new building for Brockport.</p>
<p>George Harmon Jr. was in the marble business prior to becoming a local insurance agent.
He served as Mayor, Secretary of the Agricultural Society, was an honorary member of the Board of Managers, and Secretary of the NYS Association of Town Fairs.</p>

He served as President of the Local Board of Managers for 44 years.
From 1896-1898, he represented the 45th district in the State Senate and later was Collector of Customs in Rochester.
Harrison also served as the chairperson of the Monroe County Draft Board during World War I, and was active in the Red Cross, University Club, and the Chamber of Commerce in Rochester.</p>
<p>Harrison Hall serves as a dining center for the high-rise dorms and suite dorms.
On the first floor there is a fast food eatery called Trax, a <a>Hershey's Ice Cream</a>, and a small convenience store called Snax.</p>
<p>In October 2007, Harrison re-opened after receiving a multi-million dollar renovation.</p>
<p>Construction on Hartwell Hall was initiated in 1938, and completed in 1941.
This building is named after Ernest Hartwell (1884&#x2013;1965).
It is the oldest building on campus after the Alumni House.
As Hartwell Hall was being erected the old building was torn down in stages.
At one point students in the old buildings training school wing reached the new building via a wooden gangplank one story up!
During 1938-39, Ora Van Slyke's 4th grade class in the training school organized a &quot;Sidewalk Superintendent's Club&quot; which put together a book documenting the construction in word and picture.
The book's depiction of stonemasons laying granite steps, roofers putting down copper sheeting and the like is a vivid reminder that the building really is something of which it can be said, &quot;They don't make them like that anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>Hartwell Hall and the surrounding area were recently restored to provide more modern facilities, but it still retains its aesthetically historical feel.
Aside from housing ghosts, Hartwell currently provides space for the English, Dance, Philosophy, and Recreation and Leisure departments.</p>
<p>Hazen Health Center was built in 1967 and named after Dr. John Hazen (?-1946), a local physician who served the college for many years up until 1946.
<p>Holmes Hall was built in 1967 and named for Daniel and Mary Jane Holmes.
Daniel Holmes (1828-?) was on the Board of Trustees from 1854 to 1919, and wrote the Quarter Centennial in celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Brockport State Normal School.
His wife Mary Jane was a very popular fiction writer who catered to her female readers by writing wholesome stories dwelling on domestic life in exotic surroundings.
These backgrounds were inspired by the extensive world traveling done by Mary Jane and her husband.
As Brockport's solitary literary celebrity and because of her own forceful personality, Mrs. Holmes held a very special niche in the heart of the village.</p>
<p>Lathrop Hall was built in 1951 and served as the college union for eighteen years.
By the late sixties, the new Seymour Union facility was built to meet the growing enrollment of the student body.
<p>Lathrop Hall was named after Henry Lathrop, a professor of mathematics at the college from 1912-1935.
He came to Brockport as a Mathematics teacher, and eventually rose to the Head of that department, a position he occupied until his retirement in 1935.
Mr. Lathrop was also advisor to the yearbook Saga staff, was active in civic affairs, and was a charter member of the Brockport Kiwanis club.
Lathrop was fondly referred to as &quot;Daddy Lathrop&quot; by his students, and it is in his memory that Lathrop Hall stands.</p>

He became Vice-President of the college upon his arrival in Brockport in 1858.
Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1856, he found his true interest to be in education rather than preaching.
<p>MacVicar became Principal of the Collegiate Institute in the spring of 1863, the last principal of the Collegiate Institute in 1866 and the first President of the successor Normal School.
MacVicar lead the Brockport Collegiate Institute to victory in the fierce competition to become one of the four new state normal schools.
The Normal Schools Act which established four Normal Schools was petitioned to the Legislature by Brockport under the activities of MacVicar.
The Institute merged with the Normal School in 1866 because of the financial crisis that was threatening the institution's survival.
The borrowing of money to upgrade the school to win state acceptance was a source of some local controversy, and he moved on to the Principalship of Potsdam Normal School and other posts of academia.</p>

In 1869, he became principal of the Normal School, a position he held for the next thirty years.
In spite of his short stature and slight build, President McLean was an athlete and hero to most of the student athletes at the school.
He was both a rigid disciplinarian and a skillful teacher, especially in Mathematics and Pedagogy.
Admired by his faculty and respected by his students, McLean was the dominant figure to the academic life of the school during his tenure as principal.</p>
