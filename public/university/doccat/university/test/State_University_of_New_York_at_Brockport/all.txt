established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumbnail|right|450px|Hartwell Hall</a> The College at Brockport opened as the Brockport Collegiate Institute in 1841, and later became the Brockport State Normal School in 1866.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The last Normal School class graduated in 1942 after which the school officially became a college, meaning it could grant the <a>bachelor's degree</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%(Normal School graduates received only a certificate of study when they finished, which entitled them to teach in the <a>New York</a> State schools.)
established$$$@@@%%%This enhancement of status was due in good part to the efforts of President Ernest Hartwell, who, like Malcolm MacVicar and many other <a>Brockport</a> figures, played a leading role in the education movements of the time.
established$$$@@@%%%Starting as Brockport State Teachers College, the new school was automatically included in the new SUNY system which was established in 1948.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The years after <a>World War II</a> were a time of tremendous growth for <a>higher education</a>, as thousands of veterans went to college on the <a>G.I.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Bill</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Brockport began a period of expansion in that time that was unprecedented in the school's history.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When Donald Tower became president of the school in 1944, the entire campus was what's now called Hartwell Hall.
staff$$$@@@%%%There were a few hundred students and the faculty and staff numbered under 50 people.
established$$$@@@%%%The sole purpose of the school was to train elementary school teachers.
staff$$$@@@%%%By the time he (Tower) retired in 1964 there were several thousand students and several hundred faculty and staff members.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus had expanded greatly, adding residence halls and a college union, and expanding across Kenyon Street and down Holley Street.
established$$$@@@%%%The purpose and organization of the College had also grown, as it evolved into a liberal arts college with a number of master's degree programs.
established$$$@@@%%%The first graduate degree was awarded in January 1950.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%By 1981, there were 1,185 graduate students enrolled in 11 different programs.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Today, SUNY Brockport has more than 1,800 graduate students enrolled in 26 programs.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early years of President Albert Brown (1965&#x2013;1981), the school's growth rate built to a height of activity, seeing the high-rise residence halls, library and other buildings rise up to make the campus that one sees today.
established$$$@@@%%%The school continued to evolve in the last years of the 20th century under the leadership of President John Van De Wetering (1981&#x2013;1997), who launched the MetroCenter, SUNY Brockport's classroom complex in downtown Rochester.
country$$$@@@%%%During his tenure, Brockport's international education program greatly expanded to become the largest in the SUNY system and among the 10 largest in the U.S.</p>
