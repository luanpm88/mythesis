<p><strong>Olivet Nazarene University</strong> (<strong>ONU</strong>) is a Christian institution of <a>higher education</a> located in the village of <a>Bourbonnais</a>, <a>Illinois</a>.
Named for <a>Olivet, Illinois</a>, ONU was first chartered as Illinois Holiness University in 1909 and was originally established as a <a>grammar school</a> in east-central Illinois in 1907.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Olivet Nazarene University traces its roots to 1907, when the Eastern Illinois Holiness Association started Miss Mary Nesbitt's [[grammar school]] in a house in [[Georgetown, Illinois]].
In 1908, the school's founders acquired 14 [[acre]]s in the village of [[Olivet, Illinois|Olivet]], and moved the grammar school to the proposed campus.
<p>In 1909, the <a>liberal arts college</a> was chartered and named Illinois Holiness University, with A. M. Hills from <a>Texas Holiness University</a> as its first president.
and again in 1921 to Olivet College.</p>
<p>The economic solvency of the school became a problem in the 1920s, and the trustees were forced to declare <a>bankruptcy</a> in 1926.
The school's treasurer, T. W. Willingham, purchased the school back at an <a>auction</a> and was elected president.
With the move, the school's name was changed to Olivet Nazarene College (ONC).
<p>ONU is one of eight regional U.S. <a>liberal arts college</a>s affiliated with the <a>Church of the Nazarene</a>.
In terms of the Church of the Nazarene, the &quot;Central Region&quot; comprises the Wisconsin, Northwestern Illinois, Illinois, Chicago Central, Northern Michigan, Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Northwest Indiana, Northeastern Indiana, Indianapolis, and Southwest Indiana districts, which include <a>Wisconsin</a>, <a>Michigan</a>, <a>Illinois</a>, and <a>Indiana</a>.
Each college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches on its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school.
Each college or university is also bound by a <a>gentlemen's agreement</a> not to actively recruit outside its respective &quot;educational region.&quot;</pre>
<p>ONU has been accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> since 1956 The School of Graduate and Continuing Studies offers <a>master's degree</a>s, nontraditional adult degree-completion programs, and a <a>doctor of education</a> degree only offered at Rolling Meadows as well as a master of &quot;professional counseling&quot; degree offered at a site in Hong Kong and <a>distance education</a> for a <a>master in education</a> degree.</pre>
<p>A report released in April 2008 found that, of the institutions surveyed throughout the U.S. based on data provided under the 1990 Student Right-to-Know Act, ONU had the seventh-largest gap between the average <a>graduation</a> rate for <a>white students</a> and the average graduation rate for <a>black students</a>.
<p>In 2007, President <a>John C. Bowling</a> prohibited ONU <a>alumnus</a> and <a>faculty</a> member <a>Richard G. Colling</a> from teaching the general education <a>biology</a> course and banned Colling's 2004 book: <em>Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with Creator</em> (Browning Press: ISBN 0975390406) from being required reading in the classroom.
A Newsweek article claimed that this was because he was teaching against the denomination's views on creation.
However, the university asserted that this was not the case, and that multiple biology professors continue to teach theistic evolution openly, without fear of repercussions.
Olivet&#x2019;s department of theology and department of biology issued a joint statement which read, in part, &#x201c;We recognize that great emotion and misunderstanding surround the use of the term evolution.
We acknowledge that this is intensified by extreme voices from both science and faith communities.
It is important for us to strive together in Christ-honoring ways as we explore evolution.
We affirm the value of science as a way of exploring the revelation of the Creator God in nature.
We think that the theory of evolution can be seen as a scientific explanation of the diversity of life on earth, rather than as a godless religion that denies God&#x2019;s hand in the processes of creation.&#x201d;
In 2009, the conclusion of an <a>American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) investigation found problems with shared governance at ONU and that Colling's rights had been violated when Bowling placed the concerns of many in the denomination's constituency in the <a>Church of the Nazarene</a> higher than ONU's principles of academic freedom.
Olivet officials maintained that the report was lacking in thoroughness and credibility, and continued to seek a positive outcome for both Dr. Colling and the university.
In 2009, Dr. Colling told Inside Higher Ed that as far as he was concerned the outcome is &quot;a successful and positive resolution of the academic freedom concerns originally raised.&quot;
