<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|West Ham Technical Institute (November 1898)</a></p>
<p>The institution was formed in 1970 as merger of <a>higher education</a> colleges, including the <strong>West Ham Technical Institute</strong> in Stratford, and the <strong>South East Essex Technical College</strong> in <a>Barking</a>.
It was initially known as the <strong>North East London Polytechnic</strong>, and changed its name to the <strong>Polytechnic of East London</strong> in 1989.</em></p>
<p>West Ham Technical Institute opened in 1898 and taught art, engineering, and science.
It provided <a>apprenticeship</a> classes and its science and engineering courses were accepted by the <a>University of London</a> for internal degrees.
In 1921, it was renamed the <em>municipal college</em> and became known as the <strong>West Ham College of Technology</strong>. </p>
The <a>Stratford Campus</a> is in the centre of <a>Stratford</a>, close to the 2012 Olympic Park.
It is centred around University House, a 19th century listed building.
The campus is home to the School of Distance and E-Learning, the Sir John Cass School of Education (which moved into its new centre in 2009), and the Schools of Health &amp; Bioscience and Psychology.
The School of Law is based at nearby Duncan House.
In January 2008 the Centre for Clinical Education in Podiatry, Physiotherapy and Sports Science was opened by <a>Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall</a>.
Operating in partnership with the <a>NHS</a>, the centre is London's only provider of podiatric education.

<p>The <a>Docklands Campus</a> is in London's redeveloped <a>Docklands</a> area.
It is located on the <a>Royal Albert Dock</a> waterfront, overlooking the <a>London City Airport</a> runway.
It is connected directly to Cyprus <a>DLR</a> station.
Docklands was London's first new university campus to be built in over half a century and was opened by the then <a>Mayor of London</a>, Ken Livingstone.
UEL's new Business School and Knowledge Dock centre were opened by HM <a>The Queen</a> in February 2007.
The Business School will incorporate the Petchey Centre for Entrepreneurship, named in honour of its benefactor, entrepreneur <a>Jack Petchey</a>.</p>
<p>UEL also delivers a range of programmes and short courses at the <a>Barking Learning Centre</a> in the <a>London Borough of Barking and Dagenham</a>.</p>
<p>A &#x00a3;21 million sports and leisure complex is scheduled to open at the Docklands Campus early 2012, provisionally named the Sports Dock.
<p>The university is also in talks to establish a specialist sports faculty at the Olympic Stadium after 2012.
<p>Planning permission has been granted to a collaborative project in Stratford between the University of East London and Birkbeck, University of London.
The proposed new education building will provide shared teaching facilities for both higher education institutions and their partners, which will include Newham Sixth Form College.</p>
<p>The Stratford Island University Centre (a working title for the building) will house a range of departments from each university and incorporate a range of flexible teaching and administrative spaces, alongside dedicated spaces for subjects including Law, Performing Arts, Dance, Music and Information Technology.
Work on site is likely to commence in August 2011 with the building completed and operational for the start of the academic term in autumn 2013.</p>

<p>On 21 November 2006, the UEL/<a>Birkbeck, University of London</a> Partnership at Stratford was launched when a memorandum of understanding between the two institutions was signed by the Master of Birkbeck, Professor David Latchman, and the then Vice-Chancellor of UEL, Professor Mike Thorne.
The partnership aims to improve participation in higher education in east London by attracting new students who would not otherwise participate through the provision of new opportunities and progression pathways.</p>
<p>Birkbeck was awarded nearly &#x00a3;5m in April 2006 by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE) to take its flexible, evening teaching provision to east London, which has the lowest higher education participation levels in the London region.
Birkbeck courses have been offered at the Stratford campus of UEL since September 2007 as part of the Birkbeck strand of the new partnership, now called Birkbeck Stratford.</p>
