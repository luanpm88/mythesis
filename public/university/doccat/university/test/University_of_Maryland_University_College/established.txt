<p>The <strong>University of Maryland University College (UMUC)</strong> is located in the unincorporated community of <a>Adelphi</a> in <a>Prince George's County</a>, <a>Maryland</a> in the <a>United States</a>.
The University of Maryland University College is not a division of the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a> (UMD).
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Inn &amp; Conference Center</a> UMUC is an outgrowth of the <a>University of Maryland</a>'s evening program for adults that began in the 1920s.
In 1947, the College of Special and Continuation Studies (CSCS) was established.
In 1959, The CSCS became the University of Maryland University College (UMUC).
<p>UMUC formerly had an international campus in <a>Schw&#x00e4;bisch Gm&#x00fc;nd</a>, <a>Germany</a> (near <a>Stuttgart</a>) until 2001.
It also ran a 2-year <a>residential campus</a> in <a>Munich</a>, Germany from 1950 to 1992, which then moved to <a>Augsburg</a>, Germany from 1993 to 1994, and then to <a>Mannheim</a>, Germany in 1995 until it finally closed in 2005.
The residential campus offered a two-year Associates degree and served mainly high school graduate children of U.S. military and government personnel stationed in <a>Europe</a>.</p>
<p>UMUC offers courses on over 130 military installations at locations throughout Europe, and the Middle East, as well as in Asia.
In 2004, UMUC shared the ICDE Prize of Excellence from the International Council for Open and Distance Education.
In FY 2007, UMUC's overseas divisions offered on-site classes in 22 countries throughout the world, enrolling 16,908 and 21,554 individual students, respectively through its Asia and Europe divisions, including the Middle East.
<p>UMUC is a <a>college</a> in the traditional American sense of the word, albeit one associated with a <a>university</a>.
The &quot;University of Maryland&quot; prefix indicates the historical entity to which the college originally belonged.
In the university's name, &quot;University College&quot; represents &quot;the specialized concentration on profession development&quot;, while &quot;University of Maryland&quot; represents the affiliation of the university with the <a>University System of Maryland</a>.
To American ears, the words &quot;university&quot; and &quot;college&quot; may sound synonymous, and &quot;University College&quot; would be redundant in its name.
Among the collegiate universities of Europe, however, the practice of giving one college in the university the name &quot;University College&quot; is not uncommon.
In England, for example, one of the 39 colleges of the <a>University of Oxford</a> is called <a>University College</a>.
<p>When UMUC first opened in 1947, the school was named College of Special and Continuation Studies to distinguish it as an institution independent from the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a>., which are awarded in business management, computers/information technology, communications, criminal justice/legal studies, and social sciences.
The Undergraduate program serves as a continuation of the Community Colleges of Maryland and elsewhere.
The Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs offer an escalated degree option for education and training completed in the workplace or military.
<p>The Graduate School of Management &amp; Technology offers 18 <a>master's degree</a> programs, 38 graduate certificates, and a <a>Doctor of Management</a>.
UMUC has accompanied the war-fighters in downrange locations since the Army gave them clearance in 2005.</p>
Classroom space is limited in Afghanistan, and faculty members teach their classes anywhere they can, to include hangars, unit conference rooms, dining facilities, even chapels and picnic benches.
Field Reps Stacey Tate and Danny Powers and Faculty have traveled from Germany to Baghdad and Balad to offer classes to servicemembers stationed in and around Baghdad.
<p>The headquarters for UMUC is located in <a>Adelphi</a>, <a>Maryland</a> near the campus of the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a>.
Until late 2000, UMUC's headquarters was listed in <a>College Park</a>, Maryland.
In an attempt to establish its own identity as an independent university and move away from the common notion of serving as the &quot;Night School&quot; for non-traditional students, UMUC changed its postal address to <a>Adelphi</a>, Maryland, an unincorporated community that borders College Park.
The marketing decision to change its postal address was one of many undertaken by UMUC to distinguish the university as one of the largest distance-education centers, with over 80,000 students enrolled worldwide.</p>
<p>UMUC purchased for $38&nbsp;million its new headquarters building in Largo, Maryland, which was once the headquarters site for <a>Hechinger</a> and corporate offices of <a>Raytheon</a>.
UMUC retrofitted its new headquarters to meet <a>&quot;green&quot; building</a> requirements for <a>LEEDS</a> certification.</p>
<p>During September 2009, UMUC began relocating most of its academic departments and offices to its new Academic Center at Largo, with the Office of Career Services and Office of Student Accounts remaining at the Student &amp; Faculty Services Center in Adelphi, Maryland.
UMUC plans to offer on campus classes at its new Academic Center beginning with its Spring 2010 semester.
In partnership with Maryland community colleges and other <a>University System of Maryland</a> institutions, UMUC offers courses and degree programs at several higher education centers throughout the state.
In conjunction with the <a>College of Southern Maryland</a>, it operates the Waldorf Center for Higher Education in <a>Waldorf</a>, Maryland.
A consortium of universities led by <a>Anne Arundel Community College</a>, including UMUC, operates a higher education center adjacent to Arundel Mills mall in <a>Hanover, Maryland</a>.
In addition, the University offers courses at the <a>Universities at Shady Grove</a> and <a>University System of Maryland at Hagerstown</a>, which are part of the <a>University System of Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>In <a>Europe</a>, the <a>Middle East</a>, and <a>Asia</a>, UMUC offers courses on military bases for service members, contractors, Federal employees, and their families.
In addition to <a>distance learning</a> via the Web, the university offers on-site, instructor-led classes at 130 overseas <a>US military</a> bases in 22 countries throughout the world.
Overseas instruction is coordinated through its <a>European</a>, which covers <a>USCENTCOM</a> installations in the <a>Middle East</a>, and <a>Asian</a> Divisions.
<p>UMUC specializes in <a>distance learning</a> for adult, <a>non-traditional student</a>s in Maryland, across the country, and around the world by operating <a>satellite campus</a>es and offering online instruction.
Over a third of UMUC's stateside students were African-American, and this minority group earned over a third of the degrees awarded by the university.&lt;ref
