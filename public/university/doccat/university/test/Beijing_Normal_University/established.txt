<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>180px|thumb|left|National Peking Normal University</a> The University grew out of the Faculty of Education, Capital Metropolitan University that was established in 1902 on the initiative of the emperor of <a>Qing Dynasty</a> after the <a>Hundred Days Reform</a> in 1898.
In 1908 the Faculty of Education was named as the Capital Metropolitan School of Supreme Teacher Training, and was separated from the Capital Metropolitan University which then developed to <a>Peking University</a>, also a prominent university in China.</p>
<p>After <a>Republic of China</a> was established, the Capital Metropolitan School of Supreme Teacher Training was named as Peking Normal College in 1912.
The college had its first graduate programs in 1920 and began to recruit female students in 1921.
In the year 1923 it was named as Peking Normal University, and became the first <a>normal university</a> in Chinese modern history.
The Peking Women&#x2019;s College of Education merged into Peking Normal University in 1931.

<p>When the communists established <a>People's Republic of China</a> in 1949, the capital of Peking was renamed Beijing and the university was therefore renamed as Beijing Normal University.
In 1954, it moved from He Ping Men to the newly established campus at Bei Tai Ping Zhuang and remains there since.</p>
<p>Historically, students in Beijing Normal University played a significant role in patriotic and democratic movements, particularly in the <a>May Fourth Movement</a> in 1919 and the <a>Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>.
In a <a>New York Times</a> article, it was described as &quot;one of the most progressive institutions&quot; in China .</p>
<p>The university was chosen as a <a>Project 211</a> institution in 1996.
In 2002 it signed an agreement with Ministry of Education and Beijing Municipal Government, and became the 10th university on the list of <a>Project 985</a> to get special support from the Chinese Government, aiming to be a world prestigious university .
<p>During its centennial celebration in 2002, an asteroid discovered in 1996 was named after the university as <a>8050 Beishida</a>.</p>
<p>On May 4 of 2006, Premier  <a>Wen Jiabao</a> took a special visit to Beijing Normal University.
After his visit, the Chinese government implemented the Fee-Waiver Policy for teacher training programs in six normal universities which are supervised by the Ministry of Education, including Beijing Normal University.</p>
Furthermore, the university has an institute for Proteomics which is the only one established in universities by Ministry of Education.
Besides, the university has established a Science Park which covers an area of 6&nbsp;hectares.
In 2010, 150 projects were funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, with a record high amount of RMB 62&nbsp;millions (compared with 44.7&nbsp;millions in 2009 and 37&nbsp;millions in 2007).
The research funding in humanities and social sciences has increased rapidly in the recent five years with RMB 150&nbsp;Million in total, which tops the third place nationally.
Since 2002 the annual increase has been over RMB 30&nbsp;Million and equals to RMB 40,000 per capita.
