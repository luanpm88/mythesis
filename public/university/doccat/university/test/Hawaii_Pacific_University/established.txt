<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wanting a private <a>liberal arts</a> college in Honolulu, four prominent and public-spirited citizens&#x2014;Eureka Forbes, Paul C.T. Loo, Elizabeth W. Kellerman, and The Reverend Edmond Walker &mdash; applied for a charter of incorporation for a not-for-profit corporation to be called Hawai<img>i Pacific College.
The state of Hawai<img>i granted a charter of incorporation to Hawai<img>i Pacific on September 17, 1965.
<p>In September 1966, Honolulu Christian College established in 1949 merged into Hawai<img>i Pacific College, and a new charter was granted by the state of Hawai<img>i.
<p>In 1967, James L. Meader became Hawai<img>i Pacific College's first President.
President Meader, in consultation with community leaders, developed a comprehensive educational program.
<p>When President Meader retired on June 30, 1968, the Board of Trustees elected the Reverend George A. Warmer as Hawai<img>i Pacific's second President.
Under President Warmer's leadership, the College implemented academic programs in the liberal arts and cooperative education.
<p>In 1972, Hawai<img>i Pacific College graduated seven students in its first commencement class and in the same year established a School of Business Administration.
