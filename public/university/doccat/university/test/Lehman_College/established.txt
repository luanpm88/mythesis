<p> <a>thumb|Plaza and Music Building</a> <strong>Lehman College</strong> is one of the constituent <a>college</a>s of the <a>City University of New York</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Founded in 1931 as the <a>Bronx</a> campus of <a>Hunter College</a>, the school became an independent college within the City University in 1968.
The college is named after <a>Herbert Lehman</a>, a former <a>New York</a> governor, <a>United States</a> senator, and philanthropist.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus).
During the <a>Second World War</a>, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the <a>United States Navy</a> who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as <a>WAVES</a> and <a>SPARS</a>.
The last of its graduates Sgt.
When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent <a>United Nations</a>, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.</p>

<p>Lehman has a 37-acre (15 hectare) campus with a combination of <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> and <a>modern architecture</a>.
<p>It was also the interim headquarters for the newly formed <a>United Nations</a> for six months in 1946.
<p>In the mid-1990s, a new postmodern-style gymnasium was opened, the Apex, standing in contrast to the Gothic revival buildings that define the campus.</p>
<p>The highly selective <strong><a>Macaulay Honors College</a> at Lehman</strong> provides a full tuition scholarship, $3000 yearly stipend, Apple laptop computer, as well as an opportunities fund of $7,500 that can be used for various activities such as study abroad, reimbursements for internships or research, and service learning.
<p>The Lehman Scholars Program (L.S.P.) is designed for capable and highly motivated students who have the desire and ability to pursue a somewhat more independent liberal arts course of study.
The program offers the advantages of a small, intimate college, including special courses, seminars, and individual counseling.</p>
<p>The Lehman Scholars Program has its own requirements, which students must fulfill: a one-semester honors course in English composition and stylistics; two years of a foreign language at the college level or its equivalent; four honors seminars from any of four different academic areas: Fine and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Science; and a senior honors essay.</p>
<p>Students who enter the program with more than 30 credits may be considered for exemption from one seminar after consultation with the Program Director, Professor Gary Schwartz.</p>
The mentor will advise the student in the areas of program planning and academic and career goals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Freshman Year Initiative</strong> is a program involving &quot;blocks&quot; of classes, similar to many high schools, which allows for new and first year students to get to know each other and become familiar with the college environment.
