<p>The <strong>University of Gloucestershire</strong> is a <a>university</a> primarily based in <a>Gloucestershire</a>, <a>England</a>, spread over four campuses, three in <a>Cheltenham</a> and one in <a>Gloucester</a>.
A campus in London has been sold .
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university is the recent successor of a large number of merged and name-changed institutions of further and higher education.
Its history began with the Mechanics' Institute founded in 1834.
From 1992, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education (CGCHE) was permitted to award first and postgraduate degrees and 1998 it achieved Research degree awarding powers.
However, it was only in 2001 that the University of Gloucestershire was awarded university status.
Its history spans nearly two centuries.</p>
<p><a>Dame Janet Trotter</a> was the founding Vice-chancellor and Principal, retiring in 2006.</p>
<p>The University of Gloucestershire has pursued an environmental sustainability strategy since 1993, and was the first UK university to meet the <a>ISO 14001</a> environmental management standard.
In 2008 it was declared the greenest University in the UK.
The University of Gloucestershire is also an active participant of the <a>ERASMUS programme</a> and the only UK university to be part of the <a>BCA</a> Programme offering semester abroad, most notably with the USA.</p>
<p>In October 2008, the University was subject to a journalistic investigation on student initiation rites, after the <a>BBC</a> obtained a copy of a secretly-filmed video featuring students with bags over their heads drinking and vomiting, overlooked by another student dressed in what the press described as a &quot;Nazi officer uniform&quot;.
A further incident resulted in a Rugby club member vomiting on board a bus, following what a local newspaper called a &quot;booze-fuelled initiation ceremony&quot;.</p>
<p><a>Simon Pegg</a>, the comic actor and director who plays <a>Scotty</a> in the 2009 revamp of <a>Star Trek</a>, received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Gloucestershire on the 4th of December 2008, for his contribution to the arts.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Paul Bowler, the deputy vice-chancellor of the University resigned shortly after being suspended from his post only seven months after joining the institution.
Paul Bowler, a former investment banker who joined Gloucestershire in May 2009, was on a week's leave when he was told not return to work.
On 7 December, a university spokesperson said, &quot;The deputy vice-chancellor Paul Bowler, has resigned.
<p>In September 2010 Paul Bowler was a witness in an employment tribunal case brought by a member of staff of the University under the  &#x2018;whistleblowing&#x2019; legislation - the <a>Public Interest Disclosure Act</a>.
The tribunal found for the complainant and outcome was reported in the higher education press.</p>
A campus in London was sold in April 2010.
Each campus is equipped with IT and library resources.
The four faculties in the university were restructred to three from September 2010 being renamed as: Faculty of Media, Arts and Technology; Faculty of Business, Education and Professional Studies; Faculty of Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>Decisions taken by the University to close the Pittville Campus and the London Campus (see below) have been condemned by the <a>University and College Union</a> (UCU) as resulting from bad management </p>
Founded as <em>Cheltenham School of Art</em> over 150 years ago <a>thumb|150px|Chapel at Francis Close Hall Campus.</a></p>
<p>FCH is based in the restored historic buildings at Francis Close Hall, nearest to Cheltenham's town centre, being just a short walk away from Cheltenham's lively bars, clubs, friendly terraced streets, department stores, specialist shops, community cafes, diners and restaurants.
The campus has a mix of Humanities, Education and Natural &amp; Social Science subjects.
Halls of Residence is available in Shaftsbury hall (on campus), Hardwick Halls and Regency Halls, all featuring ensuite single study bedrooms.
<p>A partnership with the <a>Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> was launched in April 2009, and the Park Campus grounds became designated as a public nature reserve.
<p>The Faculty of Sport, Health and Social Care is located at Oxstalls campus.
<p>The London Campus was established thirty years ago as the <a>Urban Learning Foundation</a> (ULF) with the aim of enhancing the quality of initial teacher training.
In September 2003, the ULF became part of the University of Gloucestershire.
The London Campus offered a one year Postgraduate Certificate in Primary Education and was the base for the North East London Graduate Teacher Programme (Primary).
The university arranged and supervised Teaching Placements in urban schools for students from other colleges around the country.
<p>The university announced the closure of the London Campus in September 2009.
This, as with Pittville Studios was another casualty of issues related to the funding cap on recruitment by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the 'financial difficulties' of the University of Gloucestershire.</p>
The LHA  was founded in 1940 to help people made homeless by the Blitz.
Today with 12 sites across the city they provide affordable accommodation for more than 1450 students, young professionals and those new to London, providing quality accommodation.</p>
