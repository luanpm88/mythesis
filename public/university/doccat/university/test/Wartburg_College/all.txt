established$$$@@@%%%Grossmann was sent by Pastor <a>Wilhelm L&#x00f6;he</a> to establish a teacher training school for German <a>immigrants</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The location of the college moved many times between <a>Illinois</a> and Iowa until permanently settling in Waverly in 1935.
established$$$@@@%%%Also in 1935 St. Paul (Phalen) Luther College of Saint Paul, Minnesota merge into Wartburg College.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The longstanding rivalry between <a>Luther College</a> in <a>Decorah, Iowa</a> and Wartburg College has produced colorful moments over several years.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The origins of the rivalry are vague.
established$$$@@@%%%Stories of pranks date back to the 1940s.
image_size$$$@@@%%%The rivalry has, for the most part, been characterized by fun and good sportsmanship.
established$$$@@@%%%The rivalry rose to new heights in October 1996, when two clever Wartburg cross-country runners rented a <a>light plane</a>, flew to Decorah, and dropped leaflets on the Luther campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The incident was reported in every major newspaper in Iowa, got national mention on the <a>Fox</a> network and made <a>Rolling Stone</a> magazine's list of the most memorable college pranks of the 1996-1997 year.
established$$$@@@%%%The creativity in the rivalry continued when student staff members of the college radio station, <a>KWAR</a>, secretly entered a float in the Luther College Homecoming Parade.
established$$$@@@%%%The staff members decorated the float as an environmental club - the Organization of Nature Enthusiasts - from Luther College.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In front of judges stand, the float quickly changed colors from blue and white to orange and black.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college is named after <a>Wartburg Castle</a> in <a>Eisenach</a>, <a>Germany</a>, where <a>Martin Luther</a> was protected during the stormy days of the <a>Reformation</a>.
