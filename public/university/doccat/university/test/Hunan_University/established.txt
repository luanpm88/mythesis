<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hunan University traces its history back to the <strong><a>Yuelu Shuyuan</a></strong> (<a>Yuelu Academy</a>) founded in the <a>Song Dynasty</a>, originally in 976, over 1000 years ago (&#x5343;&#x5e74;&#x5b78;&#x5e9c;).
<a>Shuyuan</a> (academy) were once two main forms of higher learning school in China, and another form was government-sponsored schools including imperial central school <a>Taixue</a> or <a>Guozijian</a> and regional schools.
Yuelu Academy had no degree-granting mechanism, and no some other features of a Western university.
The Yuelu Academy was a venue for Chinese scholars and their students to meet and study deep issues in broad areas of <a>Confucian Studies</a>.
In 1903 it was changed to be a modern school with the incorporation of the school which was founded in 1897, initially called Shiwu Xuetang and once in 1902 called Hunan Daxuetang (&#x6e56;&#x5357;&#x5927;&#x5b78;&#x5802;) .
The school name Hunan University (&#x6e56;&#x5357;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) was proposed in 1912, and in 1926 <strong>Hunan University</strong> was formed with the merger of three specialized public schools of Hunan.
The name <strong>Hunan University</strong> was again adopted in 1959.</p>
<p>The Chinese calligraph of &quot;Yuelu Academy&quot; was written by <a>Emperor Zhenzong of Song</a> in 1015, and the Chinese calligraph of &quot;Hunan University&quot; was written by <a>Mao Zedong</a> in 1950 as soon as the People's Republic of China was founded.
In the course of its development from <a>Yuelu Academy</a> to Hunan University, this time-honored institution has committed itself to fostering people of great talent for society and has produced large numbers of figures of outstanding scholarship.
Among its prominent students are <a>Wang Fuzhi</a>, a celebrated philosopher in Chinese history; Wei Yuan, a reformist who first advocated the idea of learning from the West; <a>Zeng Guofan</a>, the first Chinese to initiate the Modernization Movement (at the time called Yangwu Yundong, movement of emulate of oversea scitech and industry) and to make arrangements for a modern factory in China; <a>Zuo Zongtang</a>, a national hero who arranged to build China&#x2019;s first navy and took great pains to defend and develop <a>Xinjiang</a>; <a>Guo Songtao</a>, China&#x2019;s first ambassador to a foreign country; <a>Cai E</a>, a major leader in defending the <a>Republic of China</a>; the first Chinese to set foot on the continent of Antarctica; and <a>Ci Yungui</a>, the chief designer of China's first super computer.</p>
