established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Instituto de Ci&#x00ea;ncias Sociais</a> (ICS), an associated state laboratory, is a university institution devoted to research and advanced training in the social sciences.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The mission of the ICS is to study contemporary societies, with a special emphasis on Portugal and the societies and cultures with which Portugal has a historical relationship, either in Europe or in other regions of the world.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Bringing together researchers from several different disciplines, the ICS focuses its research on five main subject areas: the formation of the contemporary world; the study of citizenship and democratic institutions; the problems of sustainability, linking the environment, risk and space; social changes and individual action in the context of the family, lifestyles and schooling; and issues concerning identity, migration and religion.
country$$$@@@%%%The main subjects represented at the institute are: social and cultural anthropology, political science, economics, human geography, history, social psychology and sociology.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Researchers and the ideas they propose are the driving force of the ICS.
established$$$@@@%%%The high number of postgraduates engaged in research in a wide range of disciplines and the vitality acquired over the years make the ICS a key institution in this field of knowledge in both Portugal and Europe.
established$$$@@@%%%In terms of methodology, ICS research involves a broad range of procedures, ranging from the study of documents, ethnographic methods, qualitative studies, studies involving representative samples and experimental methods.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Having originated in 1962 as the independent Social Science Research Group (GIS), founded by Ad&#x00e9;rito Sedas Nunes, the ICS became an autonomous institute of the University of Lisbon in 1982 and acquired the status of associated state laboratory in 2002, an achievement that puts it on a par with other Portuguese institutions of excellence.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The central activities of the ICS include: publishing research in book form and in articles in Portuguese and international journals of reference; advanced education to the level of masters' degrees and doctorates; maintaining a dialogue with the international scientific community; and spreading knowledge in the wider community&#x2014;an increasingly important activity to ensure the necessary interaction between science and citizenship.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p><a>An&#x00e1;lise Social</a> (Social Analysis), Portugal's oldest and most prestigious peer-reviewed social science journal, together with the ICS's own publishing house, Imprensa de Ci&#x00ea;ncias Sociais (Social Science Press) are the most visible manifestations of the institute's activities.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The ICS is located at the University of Lisbon campus in a central area of the city next to the national library (<a>Biblioteca Nacional</a>).
country$$$@@@%%%Its new offices, opened in 2003, were especially designed for the institute's research activities and postgraduate courses.
established$$$@@@%%%The Library, which has 40,000 books and subscribes to 313 periodicals, is also home to the fast-growing Social History Archive (AHS).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In an open and informal atmosphere, the ICS has succeeded in creating an attractive environment for intellectual activity, and has developed strong ties with the academic world in Portugal and internationally.
established$$$@@@%%%Over time, the institute has established an internal culture of independence and creativity, but also of exacting standards and responsibility.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>Currently (2008), the institute has about 70 researchers and 100 postgraduate students and is engaged in about 200 research projects.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Nearly 70 per cent of its activities are financed from its own funds, which are obtained competitively.</p>
