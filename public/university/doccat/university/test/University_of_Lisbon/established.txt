<p>The <strong>University of Lisbon</strong> (<strong>UL</strong>) (, ; <a>Latin</a> <em>Universitas Olisiponensis</em>) is a <a>public university</a> in <a>Lisbon</a>, <a>Portugal</a>.
It is composed by eight <a>faculties</a>.
It was founded in 1911 after the fall of the <a>Portuguese monarchy</a> regime, but the history of a university in Lisbon goes back to the 13th century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Portuguese university school was founded in 1290 by <a>King Dinis</a> in Lisbon, and was called <a>Studium Generale</a> (<em>Estudo Geral</em>).
In the following 247 years, this first university school was moved several times between Lisbon and <a>Coimbra</a>.
In 1537, during the reign of <a>Jo&#x00e3;o III</a>, the university moved definitively to Coimbra.
The entire university institution, including the teaching staff and all the books from its library, were moved to <a>Coimbra</a> where the <a>University of Coimbra</a> was definitively installed.
Lisbon became a university city again in 1911 when the current University of Lisbon was founded, through the union of newly created and older schools, like the 19th century Polytechnic School (<em>Escola Polit&#x00e9;cnica</em>), the Royal Medical School of Lisbon (<em>Real Escola M&#x00e9;dico-Cir&#x00fa;rgica de Lisboa</em>) and the Letters Higher Studies (<em>Curso Superior de Letras</em>).</p>
<h3>Faculty of Law</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Law (Portuguese: <em>Faculdade de Direito</em>) [<a>http://www.fd.ul.pt/</a>] was officially created by a Decree of March 22, 1911 as <em>Faculdade de Ci&#x00ea;ncias Econ&#x00f3;micas e Pol&#x00ed;ticas</em>, but was only installed in 1913, and was given its current designation later in 1918.
It was transferred to its current campus at the University City (<em>Cidade Universit&#x00e1;ria</em>) in 1957-1958.
A new building, housing the Faculty's library, was built in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Among the many distinguished graduates from the faculty of law are the former <a>Presidents of Portugal</a> <a>Jorge Sampaio</a> and <a>M&#x00e1;rio Soares</a>, Prime Minister <a>Marcelo Caetano</a>, the <a>President of the European Commission</a> <a>Jos&#x00e9; Manuel Dur&#x00e3;o Barroso</a>, Portuguese statesman, deputy, and professor <a>Adriano Moreira</a> and businessman and former <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Francisco Pinto Balsem&#x00e3;o</a>. <a>First Republic</a> political leader and several times Prime Minister <a>Afonso Costa</a> was a teacher at the faculty and its founder and first director.

From that date until 1985 (when it moved to its current grounds, at Campo Grande) it was established on the former Politechnic School (<em>Escola Polit&#x00e9;cnica</em>) building.
<p>Its current grounds comprise a built area of 75662 square meters, corresponding to 8 buildings (labeled C1 through C8, where <em>C</em> stands for <em>Ci&#x00ea;ncias</em> &#x2014; Sciences) which host the classrooms, offices, cafeterias, libraries, book shop and leisure areas.

<p>Researchers of <a>LaSIGE</a>, a research laboratory for large-scale information systems (integrated into the Department of Computer Science), have received several honors, namely an IBM Scientific Award, an <a>Order of Engineers</a> distinction and a place among the eight finalists of the <a>Descartes Prize</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Instituto de Ci&#x00ea;ncias Sociais</a> (ICS), an associated state laboratory, is a university institution devoted to research and advanced training in the social sciences.</p>
<p>The mission of the ICS is to study contemporary societies, with a special emphasis on Portugal and the societies and cultures with which Portugal has a historical relationship, either in Europe or in other regions of the world.
<p>Bringing together researchers from several different disciplines, the ICS focuses its research on five main subject areas: the formation of the contemporary world; the study of citizenship and democratic institutions; the problems of sustainability, linking the environment, risk and space; social changes and individual action in the context of the family, lifestyles and schooling; and issues concerning identity, migration and religion.
The high number of postgraduates engaged in research in a wide range of disciplines and the vitality acquired over the years make the ICS a key institution in this field of knowledge in both Portugal and Europe.
In terms of methodology, ICS research involves a broad range of procedures, ranging from the study of documents, ethnographic methods, qualitative studies, studies involving representative samples and experimental methods.</p>
<p>Having originated in 1962 as the independent Social Science Research Group (GIS), founded by Ad&#x00e9;rito Sedas Nunes, the ICS became an autonomous institute of the University of Lisbon in 1982 and acquired the status of associated state laboratory in 2002, an achievement that puts it on a par with other Portuguese institutions of excellence.</p>
<p>The central activities of the ICS include: publishing research in book form and in articles in Portuguese and international journals of reference; advanced education to the level of masters' degrees and doctorates; maintaining a dialogue with the international scientific community; and spreading knowledge in the wider community&#x2014;an increasingly important activity to ensure the necessary interaction between science and citizenship.</p>
<p>The ICS is located at the University of Lisbon campus in a central area of the city next to the national library (<a>Biblioteca Nacional</a>).
The Library, which has 40,000 books and subscribes to 313 periodicals, is also home to the fast-growing Social History Archive (AHS).</p>
<p>In an open and informal atmosphere, the ICS has succeeded in creating an attractive environment for intellectual activity, and has developed strong ties with the academic world in Portugal and internationally.
Over time, the institute has established an internal culture of independence and creativity, but also of exacting standards and responsibility.</p>
