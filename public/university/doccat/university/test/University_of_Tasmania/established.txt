<p> Until 2008, there were two separate student unions the <a>Tasmania University Union</a> (TUU) in <a>Hobart</a> and the Student Association (SA) in <a>Launceston</a>.
Due to the abolition of <a>compulsory student unionism</a> in 2007, the SA and the TUU amalgamated into one Statewide Organisation representing all UTAS students.</p>
Both the TUU State President and TUU State Postgraduate sit on University Council, which is the governing body of the University of Tasmania.
<p>The university maintains a strong residential college system.
The colleges also maintain their respective student clubs, key in the passing of traditions from one cohort to the next.
