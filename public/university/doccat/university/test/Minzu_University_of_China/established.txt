It is colloquially known as <em>M&#x00ed;nd&#x00e0;</em> in <a>Putonghua</a>.
It was formerly known in <a>English</a> as the <em>Central University for Nationalities</em> (<em>CUN</em>).</p>
The old English name translated the ethnic term as &quot;nationalities&quot;, based on the term used in <a>German</a> and <a>Russian</a> language <a>Marxist</a> texts.
On 20 November 2008, the university changed its official English name,.
apparently citing concerns that &quot;central&quot;  might imply a location in the geographical centre of China (as it does in <a>South-Central University for Nationalities</a>), and the old name did not sound good.
The name change of <a>Renmin University</a> has been cited as a precedent.
<p>The university awards <a>undergraduate</a>-level degrees in 55 academic subjects, usually after four years of study.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Communist Party of China</a> first established a Nationalities Institute in its <a>Civil War</a> stronghold of <a>Yan'an</a>, in central China, in October <a>1941</a>.
In <a>1950</a>-<a>1952</a>, this was merged with other ethnolinguistic and sociological departments, including elements of <a>Peking University</a> and <a>Tsinghua University</a>.
The result was the Central Institute for Nationalities, which officially opened on 11 June 1952.
The Institute was assigned a large area of parkland on the outskirts of <a>Beijing</a> as its campus.</p>
<p>Both the Yan'an and Central institutes were intended to train cadres (officials) for ethnic minority areas, as well as providing a <a>liberal arts</a> education for promising students from the minorities.
Their research was and is intended to support the policies of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission.
In its early years, the Institute was caught up in the sensitive issue of classifying China's vast population into official ethnic groups, until the <a>Cultural Revolution</a> made conventional education almost impossible.</p>
<p>With the advent of <a>Deng Xiaoping</a>'s reform and opening up policy (c.<a>1978</a>), the Institute went through considerable changes.
On the down side, it lost most of its campus to a variety of development projects and it is now in a heavily built-up area.
<p>On the other hand, the Institute expanded into science subjects during the 1980s and achieved university status on 30 November 1993.
In 1999 it was granted &quot;key university&quot; status as part of &quot;<a>Project 211</a>&quot;, which was supposed to identify one hundred Chinese universities which would play leading roles in the 21st century.
Since 2004 the university has been a participant in <a>Project 985</a>, a major national programme to raise 39 universities to world-class status.
In 2006 a large site was acquired in Beijing's <a>Fengtai</a> district, and it is likely that a second campus will be constructed there.</p>
<p>Minzu University of China dominates one side of the Weigongcun () area, also home to <a>Beijing Foreign Studies University</a> and <a>Beijing Institute of Technology</a>.
It has restaurants from a wide variety of ethnic minorities.
According to Minzu University anthropology professor Zhuang Kongshao, the area has been the <a>Uyghur</a> ghetto in Beijing since the <a>Yuan Dynasty</a>, when it was known as Weiwucun (&quot;Uyghur village&quot;, presumably ) and was a local shopping area.
The <a>Qing</a> scholar Qiao Songnian claimed in 1834 that the Uyghurs had been brought there by <a>Yuan Taizu</a>.
The name Weigongcun is first recorded only in 1915, and removes any reference to Uyghurs.
Most of the Uyghur district was razed around 2001.
Baranovitch notes that &quot;the Xinjiang Village of Weigongcun became according to many people a centre of criminal activity&quot;, including &quot;drug dealing&quot;.</p>
