<p>The Chinese name has the meaning &quot;central ethnic university&quot;, suggesting a national-level university focused on serving minority ethnic groups.
The new name obscures the university's ethnic character, although student opinion has focused more on the fact that it makes obsolete the university's nickname, &quot;the village&quot;.
The Chinese word for village () has a <a>Hanyu pinyin</a> spelling similar to the English abbreviation &quot;CUN&quot;.
<p>The university is the pinnacle of a national network of institutions maintained by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, although academic standards are also monitored by the <a>State Education Commission</a>, which means some students end up sitting for two sets of exams.</p>
Others attribute the ethnic variety solely to the presence of CUN.
