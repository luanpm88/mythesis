<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>American Baptist Home Mission Society</a> founded the school in 1865 shortly after Union troops took control of <a>Richmond, Virginia</a> at the end of the <a>American Civil War</a>.
Southern states were in upheaval after the war.
Both planters and freedmen were trying to figure out what a free labor market would entail.
Soon, the proposed mission was expanded to offer courses and programs at college, high school and even preparatory levels, to both men and women.
This effort was the beginning of Virginia Union University.
<p>Separate branches of the National Theological Institute were set up in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> and <a>Richmond, Virginia</a>, with classes beginning in 1867.
In Washington, the school became known as <a>Wayland Seminary</a>, named in commemoration of Dr. <a>Francis Wayland</a>, former president of <a>Brown University</a> and a leader in the anti-slavery struggle.
The first and only president was Dr. <a>George Mellen Prentiss King</a>, who administered Wayland for thirty years (1867&#x2013;97).
Famous students there included Dr. <a>Booker T. Washington</a> and Dr. <a>Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.</a>  established in Richmond, Virginia in 1883, became a part of Virginia Union University.
<a>Storer College</a>, an historically black <a>Baptist</a> college in <a>West Virginia</a> (founded in 1867), merged its endowment with Virginia Union in 1964.</p>
<p>Virginia Union University's Theological training program is called &quot;The Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University&quot;.
The school of theology is known for producing preachers such as <a>James Harris</a>.
This school shares some resources with the nearby <a>Union Theological Seminary &amp; Presbyterian School of Christian Education</a> and <a>Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond</a> as the <a>Richmond Theological Consortium</a>.
The School is also a member of the <a>Washington Theological Consortium</a>.</p>
VUU won, and the Pavilion moved to Richmond in 1941 as VUU's Belgian Friendship Building.
Through 1997, the University's library was also located in the Belgian Friendship Building.</p>
This was first built in 1939 as the Belgium Building for the New York World&#x2019;s Fair.
The Belgium Building, with its stone reliefs of the Belgian Congo on the walls, was awarded to VUU after a competition among the nation&#x2019;s 23 historically black colleges in 1941.
Relocation of the building to its current location on the VUU campus was completed in 1943, and the VUU men&#x2019;s basketball team played its first game in January, 1947.</p>
The team was the 2006 National runner-up with a record of 30-4.
<p>The school plays in an annual exhibition game with the Division I cross - town rival Virginia Commonwealth University.
