<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1455, <a>Pope Nicholas V</a> granted the archbishop of Trier, <a>Jakob von Sierck</a>, to establish a university in his town.
The <em>University of Trier</em> was founded March 16, 1473.
Battling with financial problems for decades, the university was acquired by the <a>Jesuits</a> in 1560.
They emphasized the <a>philosophical</a> and <a>theological</a> faculties, at the expense of <a>medicine</a> and <a>law</a>.
In the 1580s <a>Peter Binsfeld</a> was president of the university.
In the 1730s <a>Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim</a> also was a faculty member.
After the <a>french occupation of the Rhineland</a>, the French administration ordered the Universities of <a>Cologne</a>, <a>Mainz</a> and <a>Bonn</a> closed.
The historical University of Trier was closed on April 6, 1798.</p>
<p>In 1970 the university was refounded as part of the twin-University Trier / <a>Kaiserslautern</a>.
It graduated 360 students on October 15, 1970.
In 1977 the new university campus in <a>Tarforst</a> was opened.
During the 1990s a former hospital complex was added, and dubbed <em>Campus II</em>.</p>

<p>The university is subdivided into 6 faculties (&quot;Fachbereiche&quot;).</p>

This effect is supported by the introduction of <a>Tuition</a> fees in all German  states except for Rhineland-Palatine.
<p>The <a>AStA</a><img> proposed changing the name of the University to <em><a>Karl-Marx</a>-Universit&#x00e4;t Trier</em>, honoring the city's most famous son.
Although the proposal was finally rejected, the AStA still refers to the university as &quot;Karl-Marx-Universit&#x00e4;t Trier&quot;.</p>
