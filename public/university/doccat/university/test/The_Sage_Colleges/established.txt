<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first of the colleges to be established was Russell Sage College, which was founded in 1916 by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage as a &quot;School of Practical Arts.&quot;
It has consistently been ranked in the top ten comprehensive colleges in the Northeast by U.S. News and World Report.
A &quot;Men's Division&quot; was established during World War II, and the first graduate degree was conferred by the college in 1942.
In 1949 the &quot;Albany Division&quot; was founded as a second, coeducational campus, offering associate, bachelor's and master's degrees.
In 1957 the two-year program, under the name &quot;Sage Junior College of Albany&quot;, was granted authority to offer its own degrees.
In 1995, the Sage Graduate School was given permission to grant degrees independently, the Sage Evening College was recognized as a separate educational entity, and the four elements of Sage were rechartered together as The Sage Colleges.
In the year 2002 the two-year college and the evening college were subsumed in a new four-year college of professional studies, Sage College of Albany.
The three colleges, all part of the corporate institution The Sage Colleges, are governed by a common president, Dr. Susan Scrimshaw, and a common Board of Trustees; each college has its own academic dean.</p>
