<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:GreatCourtyard.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Courtyard of Vilnius University and the Church of St. John., [[Jan Kazimierz Wilczy&#x0144;ski]], drawing, circa 1850]] In 1568, the <a>Lithuanian nobility</a> asked the <a>Jesuits</a> to create an institution of higher learning either in <a>Vilnius</a> or <a>Kaunas</a>.
The following year <a>Walerian Protasewicz</a>, the <a>bishop of Vilnius</a>, purchased several buildings in the city center and established the Vilnian Academy (<em>Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu</em>).
Initially, the Academy had three divisions: <a>humanities</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, and <a>theology</a>.
The curriculum at the College and later at the Academy was taught in <a>Latin</a>.
The first students were enrolled into the Academy in 1570.
A library at the college was established in the same year, and <a>Sigismund II Augustus</a> donated 2500 books to the new college.</p>
The University was closed on December 15, 1939 by the authorities of the Republic of Lithuania.
All the University staff and its approximately 3,000 students dismissed.. Soon after the <a>annexation of Lithuania</a> by the Soviet Union, while some Polish professors were allowed to resume teaching, many others (along with some Lithuanian professors) who were deemed <em><a>reactionary</a></em> were arrested and sent to prisons and <a>gulag</a>s in Russia and <a>Kazakhstan</a>.
Between September 1939, and July 1941, the Soviets arrested and deported nineteen Polish faculty and ex-faculty of the University of Stefan Batory, of which nine perished: Professors <a>Stanis&#x0142;aw Cywinski</a>, <a>Wladyslaw Jakowicki</a>, <a>Jan Kempisty</a>, <a>J&#x00f3;zef Marcinkiewicz</a>, <a>Tadeusz Kolaczynski</a>, <a>Piotr Oficjalski</a>, <a>Wlodzimierz Godlowski</a>, <a>Konstanty Pietkiewicz</a>, and <a>Konstanty Sokol-Sokolowski</a>, the last five victims of the <a>Katyn massacre</a>.</p>
<p>The city was occupied by Germany in 1941, and all institutions of higher education for Poles were closed.
However, the remaining Polish professors organized a <a>system of secret education</a> with lectures and exams held in private flats.
The diplomas of the underground Universities were accepted by many <a>Polish</a> Universities after the <a>War</a>.
In 1944, many of the students took part in <a>Operation Ostra Brama</a>.
The majority of the them were later arrested by the <a>NKVD</a> and deported to the Soviet Union.
From 1940 until September 1944, under Lithuanian professor and activist <a>Mykolas Bir&#x017e;i&#x0161;ka</a>, the <em>University of Vilnius</em> was open for Lithuanian students under supervision of the German occupation authorities .</p>
<p>Educated Poles were transferred to <a>People's Republic of Poland</a> after World War II under the guidance of <a>State Repatriation Office</a>.
After 1945, most of the mathematicians, humanists and biologists joined the <a>Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru&#x0144;</a>, while a number of the medical faculty formed the core of the newly-founded <a>Medical University of Gda&#x0144;sk</a>.
The <a>Toru&#x0144;</a> university is often considered to be the successor to the Polish traditions of the Stefan Batory University.</p>
<p>In 1955 the University was named after <a>Vincas Kapsukas</a>.
After it had been awarded the <a>Order of the Red Banner of Labour</a> in 1971 and the <a>Order of Friendship of Peoples</a> in 1979, its full name until 1990 was <strong>Vilnius Order of the Red Banner of Labour and Order of Friendship of Peoples V. Kapsukas State University</strong>..</p>
<p>The current University Rector is Professor <a>Benediktas Juodka</a> of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics.</p>
