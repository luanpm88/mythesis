<p><strong>University of Guadalajara</strong> is a public university in <a>Guadalajara, Jalisco</a>, <a>Mexico</a>.
It is the second oldest university in <a>Mexico</a>, the fifth oldest in <a>North America</a> and the fourteenth oldest in <a>Latin America</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Guadalajara has changed its structure, governing boards and goals throughout its 200 year history.
Due to this consistent focus and motivation, this institution is considered to have its origins during the Spanish colonial period instead of at some point during later reforms which resulted from numerous political and social changes throughout Mexican history.</p>
<p>The creation of the university was a slow process that took approximately 100 years.
The first person to request the creation of a university in Guadalajara was Father Felipe Galindo Ch&#x00e1;vez y Pineda, who asked King <a>Charles II of Spain</a> to elevate the Royal Council Seminary of San Jos&#x00e9; to the rank of Royal University on July 12, 1696.</p>
<p>The second person to take up the cause of the university was Mat&#x00ed;as Angel de la Mota Padilla, who in 1750 forced the city council to make the founding of a university one of its priorities.
Nevertheless it was not until the expulsion of <a>Society of Jesus</a> (Jesuits) from Spanish territories in 1767 that the necessity of a university in the region of the <a>Nueva Galicia</a> became urgent, because the Jesuits had administered the two most important schools in the city:  the Colleges of Saint Thomas and Saint John the Baptist.</p>

In 1775, he responded to a royal certificate from King Carlos III of Spain, in which the king asked for commentary on the placement of a university in the city of Guadalajara.
The king received a positive response and noted Fr.
Due to these positive events, in 1791 the king issued a royal certificate pronouncing the foundation of the University of Guadalajara.</p>

<p>Between 1821 and 1924, the university experienced numerous changes, including temporary closings, fractures, refinancing and changes of denomination, caused on more than one occasion by political reasons.
On  June 14, 1821, the director <a>Diego Aranda y Carpinteiro</a> swore obedience in name from the university to the representative of the independentists of the <a>Plan of Equals</a>, general <a>Pedro Celestino Negrete</a> .
With this recognition, the university lost the title of &quot;Royal and Literary Academy of New Galicia&quot; and became the National University of Guadalajara, leaving the shield granted by the Spanish monarchy and taking the one from the independentists.
In spite of such declaration of loyalty, the first temporary closing of the establishment decreed to <a>Prisciliano Sanchez</a> to it, the first governor of the state of Jalisco, in 1826, due to the turbulent state of the economy and the policy of the country after independence.
The institution reopened its doors in 1834.
