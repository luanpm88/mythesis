<p><strong>Central Michigan University</strong> (also known as <strong>CMU</strong>) is a <a>coeducational</a> <a>state university</a> located in <a>Mount Pleasant</a> in the <a>U.S.</a> <a>state</a> of <a>Michigan</a>.
Established in 1892, Central Michigan University is one of the nation&#x2019;s 100 largest public universities and the fourth largest in Michigan (behind <a>Michigan &#x2013; Ann Arbor</a>, <a>Michigan State</a>, and <a>Wayne State</a>) with more than 20,000 students on its Mount Pleasant campus and another 7,000 enrolled online and at more than 60 locations worldwide.
CMU has also established a College of Medicine, scheduled to open in 2012.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Central opened its doors in 1892 as the <strong>Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute</strong>.
At that time, few of the state's teachers received any formal training in teaching.
School founders made teacher training their mission in founding the state's second <a>normal school</a>.
The seal was transcribed in 1892 to read: Sapientia, Virtus, Amicitia &#x2013; Wisdom, Virtue, and Friendship.</p>
<p>Thirty-one students attended classes in second-floor rooms over an office on the corner of Main and Michigan streets in downtown Mount Pleasant.
Most students at the time were eighth-grade graduates, attending the &quot;Normal&quot; for a few weeks or months prior to beginning their careers as teachers.
Within the first two years, land was acquired and a $10,000 Normal School Building was constructed where Warriner Hall now stands.
The Center focuses on the moral development of CMU students.
To that end, students working with the Center have created an academic integrity handbook known by the CMU community as the <em>CMU Redbook;</em> have focused on voter education and help to educate their peers about how Michigan election law affects student voters; and produce a weekly internet radio show &quot;ethics-talk&quot; which is focused on issues that are of particular interest to students.
<p>The Central Michigan University College of Graduate Studies provides over 70 graduate degree programs at the Master's, Specialist, or Doctoral levels.</p>

The university was placed on the <a>NCAA</a>'s list of schools with &quot;hostile and abusive&quot; nicknames in August 2005, but appealed the decision, with the support of the <a>Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe</a>.
On September 2, 2005 the university announced that their appeal of the decision had been upheld.</p>
Within the university this logo is often referred to as the &quot;flying C&quot; or the &quot;running C&quot;, although it is actually called the &quot;action C&quot;.
The current version of the athletic trademark was first used in 1997.
The &quot;flying C&quot; logo was designed by IET Department undergraduate student, Jason Prout, in 1995.</p>
In 1958 the men's swimming and diving team was runner-up to <a>North Central College</a> at the second annual <a>NAIA</a> national meet, which was held in Muncie, Ind.  Central's baseball team was <a>NCAA</a> Division II runner-up in 1971, having lost to <a>Florida Southern College</a> 4 to 0 in the championship game.
In 2006 against <a>Ohio</a> and then defeated <a>Middle Tennessee State</a> in the <a>Motor City Bowl</a>.
Their final record of 12&#x2013;2 tied a school record for victories.
Frequently defeating both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in dual meets, CMU's wrestling team won its 10th straight MAC championship and seventh straight conference tournament title in 2008.
<p>CMU was a member of the <a>Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1950&#x2013;1970.</p>
In 2006, the 21st and 22nd residence halls on campus opened in what was currently the East complex.</p>
The original section of Barnes Hall is also the only part of any residence hall on campus that has community bathrooms.</p>
Since the Fall 2005 semester, Calkins Hall, home of the Education <a>residential college</a>, is co-educational, after a long history of being females only.
In the fall of 2007, Beddow and Thorpe Halls became co-ed due to a decline in students requesting to live in single-gender residence halls.
In the fall of 2008, Merrill Hall was added as a co-ed residence hall, leaving Sweeney Hall to be the only same gender hall on campus.</p>
<p>Construction began on two more buildings, Celani and Fabiano, near the East Quad in the spring of 2005.
On December 1, 2005, one of the buildings was named The Ben and Marion Celani Residence hall to recognize the generosity of Detroit area businessman Thomas Celani and his wife Vicki.
On April 20, 2006, the remaining building was named the Fabiano Family Residence Hall, recognizing their contribution to the school.
John S. Fabiano served on the board of trustees 1999&#x2013;2004, and also owns the Fabiano Brothers Inc, an alcohol distribution company.
These two new halls opened for the fall semester of 2006, along with a new Residential Restaurant to serve the residents of the six East Area halls.</p>
It won more than 50 collegiate journalism awards in the 2007&#x2013;2008 school year.
In 2005, a student-operated music label called <a>Moore Media Records</a> (MMR) was established.</p>
<p>In addition, the university owns and operates <a>WCMU-TV</a>, the region's <a>PBS</a> station, and <a>WCMU-FM</a>, the <a>NPR</a> affiliate.
Both stations serve most of Northern Michigan, including the eastern <a>Upper Peninsula</a>, through a network of repeater stations.</p>
Currently updated weekly, the magazine is run through CMU's Department of Journalism and features magazine style features from the world of sports, entertainment, style, technology and travel.</p>
