<p>The <strong>University of Ballarat</strong> is a dual-sector <a>university</a> in <a>Ballarat</a>, <a>Victoria</a>, <a>Australia</a>.
It was formed by the passage of an Act of the <a>Victorian Parliament</a> in 1994, from the <strong>Ballarat College of Advanced Education</strong>.
It subsequently merged with the <em>Ballarat School of Mines and Industries</em> (1870) and the Horsham based <em>Wimmera Institute of TAFE</em> in 1998 to create a larger University.</p>
<p>According to the university's records as of 2008, there were 25,810 students consisting of 13,820 higher education students and 11,990 <a>Technical and Further Education</a> students.
<h2>History</h2>
buildings and [[former Ballarat Gaol]] at the School of Mines and Industry.
<p>The University of Ballarat has a long history that goes back to the famous gold rush era of the 1850s.
Tertiary education at Ballarat began with the establishment of the School of Mines and Industries in 1870 making it Australia's third oldest tertiary institution.
It is for this reason that the 1870 Founders Hall at the University of Ballarat came into existence.
<p>People such as <a>Redmond Barry</a> who also founded the State Library of Victoria were involved in the original establishment to create an institution of equivalent standing to a university to offer degree level courses at Ballarat.</p>
<p>The School of Mines had two divisions - a tertiary division and a technical division.
The School of Mines remained intact offering technical and secondary level programs, while the tertiary division became Ballarat Institute of Advanced Education.
<p>In the late 1980s the <a>Dawkins Revolution</a> had arrived and Ballarat CAE was in trouble in terms of losing its long historical identity.
In an era where larger metropolitan colleges were opting for mergers with existing universities, such as <a>Chisholm Institute of Technology</a> with <a>Monash University</a>, <a>Melbourne College of Advanced Education</a> with <a>Melbourne University</a>, <a>Philip Institute of Technology</a> with <a>RMIT University</a>, <a>Lincoln Institute of Health Science</a> and <a>Bendigo College of Advanced Education</a> with <a>La Trobe University</a>, and <a>Victoria College</a> and <a>Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education</a> with Geelong's <a>Deakin University</a>, Ballarat was faced with the prospects of merging with Deakin University, an option the board of Ballarat CAE did not want to accept arguing in the words of the then director Professor John Sharpham who publicly declared that &quot;Deakin is not strong&quot; and who attempted to arrange a merger of &quot;equal sides&quot; where Ballarat CAE, Warrnambool IAE, and Deakin would merge to become the <a>University of Western Victoria</a>.
<p>The proposal was rejected by Deakin, which left Ballarat alone as the remaining college in Victoria not to become a university.
Then along came the University of Melbourne which allowed Ballarat CAE to become an affiliated college of the University.
The name of Ballarat CAE was changed to &quot;<em>Ballarat University College, an affiliated College of the University of Melbourne</em>&quot; which are the actual words put on graduates' testamurs.
At this point it seemed that BUC was heading to become the Ballarat campus of Melbourne University which would have given it a sizable rural campus in Western Victoria.
<p>Ballarat University College then pursued the push to become a fully-fledged university in its own right.
This began when Professor John Sharpham asked the board of BUC, that if <a>Southern Cross University</a> is allowed to divorce the <a>University of New England</a> by becoming a university in its own right, then Ballarat should be allowed to do the same.
This led to lobbying efforts to the Federal Government which responded by sending three Vice-Chancellors (incidentally one from University of New England) from Australian Universities to Ballarat to consider whether Ballarat could become a university in its own right.
The result was favorable and the university college became a university in 1994 without any links to Melbourne University except that Melbourne would observe the academic standards at the new university for a five-year period.
<p>For a young and small higher education institution, University of Ballarat did well in the 2007 edition of the Good Universities Guide scoring a total of 10 stars out of 20 in the status and standing section for the university.
This puts the University of Ballarat on par with <a>LaTrobe University</a>'s 10/20, and ahead of <a>Victoria University</a>'s 8/20.
<p>In terms of its research intensivity score of 4/5, Ballarat equalled <a>Monash University</a> and <a>Swinburne University of Technology</a>, and outscored <a>RMIT University</a> 3/5, <a>Deakin University</a> 2/5, <a>LaTrobe University</a> 2/5, and <a>Victoria University</a> 1/5.
<p>The University of Ballarat's teaching performance was ranked in the top ten of Australian universities according to data released by the Federal Department of Education, Science and Training in 2005.
<p>The university has a technology park with the mission to facilitate the development of technology based companies or companies that benefit from the technological resources of the university.</p>
Recently <a>IBM</a> decided to expand its workforce with the construction of a new $10 million building on the park.
It is Australia's leading regional technology park.</p>
For example the Graduate School of Information Technology and Mathematical Sciences is engaged in research that looks at optimising space in buildings.
<p>Beyond the formal research program, the University of Ballarat has a strong history of scholarly activity and research that pre-dates its accreditation as a University in 1994..</p>
The Institute is a research organisation that focuses on rural and regional issues.</p>
<p>The University has six campuses: two in Ballarat, one each in Ararat, Horsham and Stawell and one in Mount Helen.</p>
<p>Located in central Ballarat and incorporates the original School of Mines Ballarat and old Ballaraat Gaol.
The <a><strong>SMB Campus</strong></a> offers courses from Certificate level through to Applied Bachelor Degrees.
