established$$$@@@%%%<p>, abbreviated to , is a <a>municipal university</a> in <a>Japan</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It is located in <a>Sumiyoshi-ku</a>, <a>Osaka City</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Its root was founded in 1880, as Osaka Commercial Training Institute () with the donations by the local merchants.
established$$$@@@%%%It developed into Osaka Commercial School in 1885, then was municipalized in 1889.
established$$$@@@%%%Osaka City was defeated in a battle to draw the Second National Commercial College (the winner was <a>Kobe</a> City), so the city authorities decided to establish a municipal commercial college without any aid from the national budget.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the beginning of the School's hard history.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1901 the school was reorganized into Osaka Municipal Commercial College (), later authorized under Specialized School Order in 1904.
established$$$@@@%%%The college had grand brick buildings around <a>Taish&#x014d; period</a> - the most prosperous days both of the school and of the city.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1928 the college developed into Osaka University of Commerce (), the first municipal university in Japan.
established$$$@@@%%%The city mayor, Dr. Hajime Seki (, 1873&#x2013;1935) declared the spirit of the municipal university, that <em>it should not simply copy the national universities</em> and that it should become a place for research with a background of urban activities in Osaka.
established$$$@@@%%%But, contrary to his words, the University was removed to the most rural part of the city by 1935.
established$$$@@@%%%The first president of the University was a liberalist, so the campus gradually became what was thought to be &quot;a den of the Reds (Marxists)&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%During <a>World War II</a>, the Marxists and the socialists in the University were arrested (about 50 to 80 members) soon after the liberal president died.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus was evacuated and used by the Japanese Navy.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>After the war, the campus was wholly occupied by U.S. Army (Camp Sakai), so a number of students became anti-American fighters and &quot;worshipers&quot; of the <a>Soviet Union</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus was given back to the University, partly in 1952, and thoroughly in 1955.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1949, during the occupation, the University was merged (with other 2 municipal colleges) into <strong>Osaka City University</strong>, under Japan's new educational systems.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>At first OCU had five faculties (Business / Economics / Law and Literature / Science and Engineering / Home Economics).&lt;br /&gt; In 1953, the Faculty of Law and Literature was divided into two faculties.&lt;br
established$$$@@@%%%/&gt; In 1955, Osaka City Medical University was merged and became Medical School.&lt;br
established$$$@@@%%%/&gt; In 1959, the Faculty of Science and Engineering was divided into two faculties.&lt;br
established$$$@@@%%%/&gt; In 1975, the Faculty of Home Economics was reorganized into the Faculty of Human Life Science.&lt;br
established$$$@@@%%%/&gt; In 2003, the faculty members of the Institute for Economic Research (established in 1928) were transferred to establish the Graduate School of Creative Cities.&lt;br
country$$$@@@%%%/&gt; In 2006, the Institute for Economic Research was reorganized into the Urban Research Plaza.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In September 1950, Osaka City was attacked by Typhoon Jane and the city budget was heavily injured.
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, a taxation reform (advised by Carl Sumner Shoup) deprived the city of large income from eating houses.
established$$$@@@%%%So OCU gradually became a mere burden to the city.</p>
