<p>From time to time TWU has garnered publicity due to the University's policy known as the &quot;Responsibilities of Membership.&quot;
As a <a>private university</a>, Trinity has made the decision to enact certain &#x201c;responsibilities&quot; which the University believes accompanies an atmosphere more conducive to learning and community.
Beginning in the 2009-10 school year, TWU introduced a &quot;Community Covenant&quot; to replace the &quot;Responsibilities of Membership.&quot;</p>
<p>Notably more restrictive than standards imposed by Canadian law and public universities, members of the TWU community agree not to be involved in:</p>
<li>communication that is destructive to TWU community life and inter&#x2013;personal relationships, including gossip, slander, vulgar/obscene language, and prejudice</li>
<li>sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman</li>
<p> In 1995, TWU launched a teaching certification program, but the <a>British Columbia College of Teachers</a> denied accreditation of TWU's program, arguing that the agreement students must sign is discriminatory and that those graduating from Trinity Western's program will discriminate against gay students.
The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the Supreme Court of Canada, ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating that there was no basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that &quot;the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the classroom is not supported by any evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>The final analysis of the case, as reported by the Factum of the Intervener, the <a>B.C.
Civil Liberties Association</a>, was that <em>&quot;In the circumstances of this case the Council of the B.C. College of Teachers failed to conduct such an enquiry and erroneously concluded that equality of rights on the basis of sexual orientation trump freedom of religion and association.
