established$$$@@@%%%The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the Supreme Court of Canada, ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating that there was no basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that &quot;the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the classroom is not supported by any evidence.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The final analysis of the case, as reported by the Factum of the Intervener, the <a>B.C.
established$$$@@@%%%Civil Liberties Association</a>, was that <em>&quot;In the circumstances of this case the Council of the B.C. College of Teachers failed to conduct such an enquiry and erroneously concluded that equality of rights on the basis of sexual orientation trump freedom of religion and association.
