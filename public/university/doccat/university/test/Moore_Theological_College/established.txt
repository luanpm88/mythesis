<p><strong>Moore Theological College</strong>, otherwise known simply as <strong>Moore College</strong>, is the theological training <a>seminary</a> of the  <a>Diocese of Sydney</a> in the <a>Anglican Church of Australia</a>.
The college has a strong tradition of <a>conservative</a>, <a>Calvinist</a> and <a>evangelical</a> theology.</p>
<p>The college is one of the largest Anglican seminaries in the world, with full-time enrolments numbering in the hundreds and a first year enrolment of 136 in 2006.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Moore College was opened by the Anglican Bishop of Sydney, <a>Frederic Barker</a>, in <a>Liverpool, New South Wales</a> on 1 March 1856 (making 2006 the 150th anniversary of foundation) in the former home of  <a>Thomas Moore</a>.
When Thomas Moore died in 1840 he left his substantial estate to the Church of England with specific provision for the founding of a college to train young men in the principles of the United Church of England and Ireland.
In 1891 the college was moved to <a>Newtown</a> to be near the <a>University of Sydney</a>.
The college has numerous buildings in the surrounding area, the latest building opened was the Broughton Knox Teaching Centre in 1994.
<p>The Moore College Library is the biggest theological library in Australia, with close to 300,000 works in its collection.
It also houses numerous manuscripts and other items of significance to Anglican, Australian and Evangelical history.</p>
Through the influence of Moore College, <a>Sydney Anglicanism</a> has maintained its unique Evangelical perspective within worldwide Anglicanism.</p>
<p>Moore College teaches subjects in the areas of biblical studies, ministry and Christian thought and history.
There is an emphasis on study of the Bible in the original languages, and practical experience for students in Christian ministry.
Most of the college's students are also employed in Christian ministry at churches throughout <a>Sydney</a> and alumni include the likes of <a>Phillip Jensen</a>, as well as an increasing Asian Australian outreach with the likes of <a>Gordon Cheng</a> and Steve Chong.</p>
<p>The college also runs a bookstore, <em>Moore Books</em>, which provides low cost Christian books to students and the public.</p>
<p>Since the 1940s the college's Department of External Studies has  trained lay preachers within the Diocese of Sydney.
These students initially attended evening lectures but the course was gradually offered by correspondence.</p>
<p>The department still runs evening lectures as well as a more fully developed correspondence course offered at three levels: the Preliminary Theological Certificate, the Certificate in Theology and the Diploma in Biblical Studies.
Translation is underway into Chinese, Tamil, Hindi and Hausa.</p>
<p>Accreditation is by the NSW Department of Education and Training.</p>
<p>The college offers a number of degrees and diplomas, including a <a>Bachelor of Divinity</a>, <a>Bachelor of Theology</a> and various masters degrees.
The <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree is offered both in association with the <a>University of Sydney</a> and with the <a>University of Western Sydney</a>.</p>
