<h2>History</h2>
Cloud State University opened its doors to students in 1869, under the name Third State Normal School.
The school consisted of one building, the Stearns House, a renovated hotel purchased by the state Legislature for $46,000.
Classrooms were on the first floor, the &quot;model school&quot; was on second floor and a women's dormitory was housed on the third floor.
The five-member faculty was headed by Principal Ira Moore.
Of the 53 original students, 43 were women.
In 1898, the school began offering a junior college curriculum.</p>
<p>In 1914, the school dropped its secondary education program entirely.
The legislature authorized a name change in 1921, allowing the school to adopt the name St. Cloud State Teachers College (the word &quot;teachers&quot; was deleted in 1957).
St. Cloud State now confers degrees from its colleges of Business, Education, Fine Arts and Humanities, Science and Engineering, Social Sciences, and the School of Graduate Studies.

<p>After an extensive restoration project in 2002 and 2003, St. Cloud State reopened the doors to historic Lawrence Hall to host a cultural melting pot of international and American Students studying foreign languages.
The hall was first built in 1895 housing women students and later housing men for a few years.
After originally being touted as fireproof, the building burned beyond repair and a new Lawrence Hall was built in 1905.
It once again served as housing until it was retired in 1974 with exception to the basement floor which was used to facilitate a Math Skills Center.
The Math Skills Center was forced out of the hall in 1999 after the structure was deemed unfit.
After being distinguished as a campus eyesore efforts began to start a restoration campaign of the hall with funding for the project coming from the state's Legislation's bonding bill in 2000.</p>
