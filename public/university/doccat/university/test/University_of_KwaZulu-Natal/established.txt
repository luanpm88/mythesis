and the constitution of the  university is specified in the Statute of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, as approved by the <a>South African Minister of Education</a> and the <a>Parliament of South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of the statute, the university consists of:</p>
<li>the chancellor (the titular head).
The first chancellor of the merged university was Dr <a>Frene Ginwala</a>.
<li>the council (responsible for governance of the institution as a whole)</li>
<li>the institutional forum (responsible for advising the council on matters of human rights and equality)</li>
<h3>Freedom of expression</h3>
<p>In 2007 the Freedom of Expression Institute was concerned about the university's  suspension of professor <a>Evan Mantzaris</a> for criticising management, &quot;part of a larger process in which the space for free expression and academic freedom at that university is being narrowed&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2008 the <a>London Review of Books</a> stated that the University &quot;is in vertiginous decline&quot;</p>
<p>In 2008 Education Minister <a>Naledi Pandor</a> wanted to meet vice-chancellor <a>Malegapuru Makgoba</a> and discuss resignations of staff over expression concerns, and the condemnation from <a>Cosatu</a> and the Freedom of Expression Institute for the punishment of academics.</p>
<p>UKZN academics Fazel Khan and Sally Giles directed a documentary film about <a>Abahlali baseMjondolo</a>, a shack-dwellers' movement.
When Kahn was excised from both the photo and text in an article about the documentary in the university newsletter <em>UKZNdaba</em>, he was charged with dishonest conduct because he told newspapers that he believed that he had been excised from the photograph and text by the university management due to his role in the staff strike of 2006.
Khan was found guilty of bringing the university into disrepute and fired.
The Mercury had previously reported that vice-chancellor Makgoba had publicly declared that, following a request from Mayor <a>Obed Mlaba</a>, he would charge Khan and 2 other academics working with Abahlali baseMjondolo for 'incitement'.
<p>As the university has only existed since 2004, very few of its graduates have had the opportunity to attain great fame.
