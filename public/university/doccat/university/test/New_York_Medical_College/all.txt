established$$$@@@%%%York Medical College celebrates its sesquicentennial in 2010.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>New York Medical College owes its founding in 1860 to a group of civic leaders who believed that medical studies should be practiced with a better understanding of what the <a>patient</a> needs.
established$$$@@@%%%This group of civic leaders was led by the noted poet <a>William Cullen Bryant</a> who was an editor of the <em><a>New York Evening Post</a></em>.
established$$$@@@%%%Bryant was concerned about the condition of hospitals and medical education in New York City.
established$$$@@@%%%His main concern was with some of the medical practices being used to treat disease, which at the time included bleedings, purges, and the administration of strong drugs in too large doses.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Interest in the medical field rapidly grew over the next few years due to the <a>United States Civil War</a>, which generated a major need for health related occupations.
established$$$@@@%%%As a result, the college was founded and opened as the Homeopathic Medical College of the State of New York on the corner of 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street and <a>Third Avenue</a>, near <a>Union Square</a> in <a>Manhattan</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%In the first semester there were 59 students and 8 professors.
established$$$@@@%%%The college adopted the name New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1869 and, in 1887, New York Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>A separate institution known as the New York Medical College for Women was founded a few years later in 1863.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1867, it graduated <a>Emily Stowe</a>, the first female physician to practice in Canada.
established$$$@@@%%%Three years later in 1870, <a>Susan McKinney Stewart</a> graduated as the first African-American female physician in New York State.
city$$$@@@%%%When the Women's College closed in 1918, its students transferred to New York Medical College.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1875, <a>Metropolitan Hospital Center</a> opened as a municipal facility on Ward&#x2019;s Island, staffed largely by the faculty of New York Medical College.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Built by New York Medical College in 1889, The Flower Free Surgical Hospital, was the first teaching hospital in the United States to be owned by a medical college.
established$$$@@@%%%It was constructed at York Avenue and 63rd Street with funds given largely by Congressman Roswell P. Flower, later governor of New York.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1908 the College changed its name to New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1928 the College was the first medical school in the nation to establish a minority scholarship program.

established$$$@@@%%%The College became affiliated with the <a>Archdiocese of New York</a> in 1978, which helped provide financial stability and also established a shared commitment for the public good in the area of health care and the health sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%The College now recognizes itself as in the <a>Catholic</a> tradition, and remains affiliated with several Catholic hospitals.
city$$$@@@%%%Cuts in reimbursement forced the closure of Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital in 1979, and the main operations of New York Medical College were transferred to the Valhalla campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The college shortened its name to its current form, New York Medical College, in 1982.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1984, the New York State Department of Education recognized the status of New York Medical College as a university.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In December 2009, it was announced that <a>Touro College</a> had reached an agreement to assume the sponsorship role for New York Medical College from the Archdiocese.
established$$$@@@%%%The Archdiocese would receive $60 million in payment, half to be invested in New York Medical College and half committed to supporting the remaining healthcare operations of the Archdiocese.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This transfer was to occur in the summer of 2010, but has not taken place as of September 2010.</p>
