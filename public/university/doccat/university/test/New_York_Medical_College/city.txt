<h2>History of New York Medical College</h2>
When the Women's College closed in 1918, its students transferred to New York Medical College.
Cuts in reimbursement forced the closure of Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital in 1979, and the main operations of New York Medical College were transferred to the Valhalla campus.
