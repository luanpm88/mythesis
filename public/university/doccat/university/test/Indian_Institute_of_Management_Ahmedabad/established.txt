<h2>History</h2>
<a>Vikram Sarabhai</a> and a few other public-spirited industrialists realized that agriculture, education, health, transportation, population control, energy and public administration were all vital elements in a growing society and that it was necessary to link these meaningfully with industry.
The result was the creation of IIMA in 1961 as an autonomous body with the active collaboration of the Government of India, the Government of Gujarat as well as industry.</p>
<p>IIMA was conceived not purely as a business school, but as a school of management.
Its mission is to professionalize Indian management through teaching, research, training, institution building and consulting.</p>
<p>In its formative years, IIMA collaborated with <a>Harvard Business School</a>.
IIMA pioneered the <a>case method</a> of research and teaching in India.
This attracted an increasing number of applicants, a trend which accelerated after the <a>liberalisation of the economy in the early 1990s</a> and its subsequent globalisation.
