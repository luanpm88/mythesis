type$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Previous Sacramento State seal</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The efforts to get a four-year university in Sacramento date back to the 1920s, however Bay Area politics prevented the founding until 1947 (most likely because of competition, with Sacramento being in such close proximity to the Bay Area).
free_label$$$@@@%%%The University's colors green and gold symbolize the green of the foothills and trees, and gold for discovery.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was founded as <strong>Sacramento State College</strong> in 1947 during a time of intense demand for higher education after <a>World War II</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%At the time of its founding, Sac State shared space at <a>Sacramento Junior College</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By 1953, the school had moved to its permanent location on the banks of the <a>American River</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Jackrabbits</a> were a problem in the early years and landscapers were permitted to shoot them on sight.
established$$$@@@%%%Sacramento State became part of the <a>California State University</a> system in 1960, and in 1972, the university changed its name to <strong>California State University, Sacramento</strong>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university underwent a major expansion in the <a>Korean War</a> years, with the 'heart' of the campus residing in what was then Douglass Hall, Shasta Hall, and buildings housing the Math, Science, and History departments.
