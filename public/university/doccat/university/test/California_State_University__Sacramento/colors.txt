<p><em>All Hail to Sacramento</em>&lt;br /&gt; <em>Your colors green and gold;</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>We'll Hail our Alma Mater,</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>As on the years do roll;</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>She stood by us through trials,</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>A beacon to our way;</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>With hearts both proud and grateful</em> &lt;br /&gt; <em>We sing of thee this day.</em>
