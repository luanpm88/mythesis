It is part of the <a>California State University</a> system.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The efforts to get a four-year university in Sacramento date back to the 1920s, however Bay Area politics prevented the founding until 1947 (most likely because of competition, with Sacramento being in such close proximity to the Bay Area).
<p>The university was founded as <strong>Sacramento State College</strong> in 1947 during a time of intense demand for higher education after <a>World War II</a>.
At the time of its founding, Sac State shared space at <a>Sacramento Junior College</a>.</p>
<p>By 1953, the school had moved to its permanent location on the banks of the <a>American River</a>.
<a>Jackrabbits</a> were a problem in the early years and landscapers were permitted to shoot them on sight.
Sacramento State became part of the <a>California State University</a> system in 1960, and in 1972, the university changed its name to <strong>California State University, Sacramento</strong>.</p>
<p>The university underwent a major expansion in the <a>Korean War</a> years, with the 'heart' of the campus residing in what was then Douglass Hall, Shasta Hall, and buildings housing the Math, Science, and History departments.
<p>Sac State came within hours of being deliberately flooded in 1986, as officials contemplated blowing floodgates to avoid a massive levee failure in <a>Sacramento</a>.</p>
<p>The period between 1984 and 2003 marked unprecedented growth and budget stability for the University.
During this period, the campus nearly doubled in size with the construction of over nearly a dozen academic and service buildings.

<p>After the construction of Placer Hall, many of the remaining buildings were renamed for California counties and/or other local landmarks of significance (i.e.
The administration building was aptly renamed &quot;Sacramento Hall&quot;.</p>
Events were held at <a>Hornet Stadium</a> in the <a>Alex Spanos</a> Sports Complex.</p>
<p>Recently built were the Alumni Center, a continuing education building, a facility for University-licensed public radio stations, the Academic and Information Resource Center (AIRC), and a third parking garage.</p>
<p>In 2004, the school decided to re-brand itself and is now known as <strong>Sacramento State</strong> (<strong>Sac State</strong> for short); though students had been referring to the school by this name for years.
The University also adopted a new logo and seal.
These replaced the previous design based on the <a>Seal of California</a>.</p>
The North end of campus is dominated by the <a>Goethe Arboretum</a> and residence halls.</p>
