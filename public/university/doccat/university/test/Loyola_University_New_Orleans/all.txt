established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Loyola College, circa 1904</a>In the early 18th century Jesuits first arrived among the earliest settlers in New Orleans and Louisiana.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Loyola University New Orleans was founded by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in 1904 as Loyola College on a section of the Foucher Plantation bought by the Jesuits in 1886.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%A young Jesuit, Fr.
established$$$@@@%%%Albert Biever, was given a <a>nickel</a> for <a>street car</a> fare and told by his <a>Jesuit</a> superiors to travel <a>Uptown</a> on the <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Charles Streetcar</a> and found a university.
type$$$@@@%%%As with many Jesuit schools, it contained both a college and preparatory academy.
established$$$@@@%%%The first classes of Loyola College were held in a residence behind <a>Most Holy Name of Jesus Church</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Fr.
established$$$@@@%%%Biever was the first president.
established$$$@@@%%%The first of Loyola's permanent buildings was undertaken in 1907, with Marquette Hall completed in 1910.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1911, the <a>Jesuit</a> schools in <a>New Orleans</a> were reorganized.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>College of the Immaculate Conception</a>, founded in 1847 in downtown <a>New Orleans</a>, split its high school and college divisions and became solely a secondary institution, now known as <a>Jesuit High School</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Loyola was designated as the collegiate institution and was chartered as Loyola University on July 10, 1912.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Growth</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:Loyarchdoor.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Entrance to the Memorial Library (1950), dedicated to Loyolans killed in [[World War II]]]]Loyola grew steadily over the years on its uptown campus.
established$$$@@@%%%By the end of its first decade, the university not only included the College of Arts and Sciences, but also a School of Law (1914), a School of Dentistry (1914), and a College of Pharmacy (1919).
nickname$$$@@@%%%Several years later, a School of Music was added to the growing curriculum.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With the discontinuance of the football program in the 1930s, more space became available for construction of new facilities.
established$$$@@@%%%Stallings Hall, built as a dedicated building for the College Of Business Administration, and the Memorial Library (now known as the &quot;Old Library&quot;) were constructed in the post <a>World War II</a> years, accommodating the growth of the student population.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Norman Francis</a> entered the Law School in 1952, becoming the first <a>African-American</a> admitted to the university.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>More expansion continued in 1964, with the addition of the Joseph A. Danna <a>Student Center</a>; Albert Biever Hall, a <a>student residence</a> hall named after the first <a>university president</a>; and a central heating/cooling plant.
established$$$@@@%%%Built soon after in 1967 was Henrietta Buddig Hall, a student residence that is Loyola's tallest building at twelve stories.
established$$$@@@%%%The last building to be added in the 1960s was the J. Edgar Monroe Science Building (now known as Monroe Hall), the largest academic building erected to date.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1970s, Loyola began to make many changes, especially regarding Jesuit governance and in the academic curriculum, reflective of many universities during the same period.
established$$$@@@%%%Reflecting the precedent for reform established by <a>Vatican II</a>, governance of the university shifted from a Jesuit regulated Board of Regents to a combined lay and clerical Board of Trustees.
established$$$@@@%%%During this period, the Common Curriculum was developed to give students a wide breadth of knowledge in certain core areas, including <a>Science</a>, <a>Math</a>, <a>History</a>, and <a>English</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A broader trend was seen in the growth of the university during this period, seeing it gradually transform from a regional, largely commuter college to a higher national profile school that attracted students from across the <a>United States</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1984 Loyola purchased the facilities of <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Mary&#x2019;s Dominican College</a>, a nearby Catholic women's college which was closing down, and transformed it into the Broadway campus (after the name of its street location).
established$$$@@@%%%Today, the Broadway campus includes Loyola's School of Law, Cabra Residence Hall, and a Department of Visual Arts.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Expansion in recent years has seen the addition of Mercy Hall, purchased in 1993, a former girl's preparatory academy; construction of Carrollton Hall, an upperclassman residence; and the J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library, the latter two completed in 1999.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1996, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities granted exclusive branding rights to <a>Loyola University Chicago</a> to call itself <em>Loyola University</em>.
city$$$@@@%%%This resulted in Loyola New Orleans' current trademark, <em>Loyola University New Orleans</em>.</p>
campus$$$@@@%%%<h3>Hurricane Katrina and Aftermath</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In August 2005, Loyola closed its campus and evacuated its students in anticipation of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The campus sustained minimal wind damage including broken windows but floodwaters did not breach any buildings.
established$$$@@@%%%Following cleanup, classes resumed on Monday, January 9, 2006.
students$$$@@@%%%Despite the displacement of the entire student body during the fall 2005 semester, 91 percent of Loyola&#x2019;s undergraduate students returned for the spring 2006 semester.
established$$$@@@%%%Loyola held commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2006 on April 28&#x2013;29, becoming the first New Orleans college to do so post-Katrina.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>On April 10, 2006, President <a>Kevin Wm.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Wildes</a>, S.J. unveiled <em>PATHWAYS - Toward Our Second Century</em>, Loyola's strategic post-Katrina plan.
established$$$@@@%%%The plan restructured the University's colleges and eliminated several academic programs and faculty positions to reduce operating costs and revitalize the University.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;PATHWAYS&quot; was widely criticized by students and staff who felt uninvolved in the decision-making process.
established$$$@@@%%%The Board of Trustees, however, unanimously approved and passed the plan on May 19, 2006.
established$$$@@@%%%In response, the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences produced a <a>vote of no-confidence</a> in both President Wildes and Provost Walter Harris.
students$$$@@@%%%In fall 2006, Loyola welcomed the class of 2010, the first post-Katrina freshman class, with 555 new students.
established$$$@@@%%%Since the storm, Loyola has completed all physical repairs that were caused by the hurricane, and its enrollment is on a steady rise to pre-Katrina numbers.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Loyola is located in the historic <a>Audubon Park District</a> on <a>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Charles Avenue</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Its original campus, now called the Main Campus, was founded on a tract of land purchased by the New Orleans Jesuits in 1889.
established$$$@@@%%%The purchased portion of land was much larger than the current day campus; in fact, the original land purchase contained the land now occupied by both Loyola and <a>Tulane</a> universities and Audubon Place.
established$$$@@@%%%Through the next twenty years, portions of the original land purchase were sold to different entities to raise money for the new university, resulting in the current Main Campus area of 19 <a>acre</a>s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the 1950s, most of the original campus had been developed and the university looked around for areas where it could expand.
established$$$@@@%%%In the 1960s, J. Edgar Monroe, a major benefactor of the university, donated to Loyola a large undeveloped tract of land in <a>Metairie</a> where the university could either expand or move its entire location.
established$$$@@@%%%After reviewing its options, including the sale of the original campus to <a>Tulane University</a>, the university decided to remain on <a>St.
established$$$@@@%%%Charles Avenue</a>, subsequently selling off its property in Metairie in ten years as a condition of the donation.</p>
