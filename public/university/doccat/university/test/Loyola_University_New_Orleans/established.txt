Originally established as Loyola College in 1904, the institution was chartered as a university in 1912.
It bears the name of the Jesuit patron, <a>Saint Ignatius of Loyola</a>.
Loyola University New Orleans is ranked fifth best institution among Southern regional universities offering masters and undergraduate degrees in the 2008 issue of the annual America's Best Colleges issue and guidebook published by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.
''[[The Princeton Review]]'' also features Loyola New Orleans in the most recent editions of its annual book, ''The Best 371 Colleges.''
In the past, the school has been called ''Loyola of the South'', ''Loyola New Orleans'', ''Loyola University, New Orleans'', and ''Loyola University of New Orleans''.</pre>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Loyola College, circa 1904</a>In the early 18th century Jesuits first arrived among the earliest settlers in New Orleans and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Loyola University New Orleans was founded by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in 1904 as Loyola College on a section of the Foucher Plantation bought by the Jesuits in 1886.
Albert Biever, was given a <a>nickel</a> for <a>street car</a> fare and told by his <a>Jesuit</a> superiors to travel <a>Uptown</a> on the <a>St.
Charles Streetcar</a> and found a university.
The first classes of Loyola College were held in a residence behind <a>Most Holy Name of Jesus Church</a>.
Biever was the first president.
The first of Loyola's permanent buildings was undertaken in 1907, with Marquette Hall completed in 1910.</p>
<p>In 1911, the <a>Jesuit</a> schools in <a>New Orleans</a> were reorganized.
The <a>College of the Immaculate Conception</a>, founded in 1847 in downtown <a>New Orleans</a>, split its high school and college divisions and became solely a secondary institution, now known as <a>Jesuit High School</a>.
Loyola was designated as the collegiate institution and was chartered as Loyola University on July 10, 1912.</p>
<p>[[Image:Loyarchdoor.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Entrance to the Memorial Library (1950), dedicated to Loyolans killed in [[World War II]]]]Loyola grew steadily over the years on its uptown campus.
By the end of its first decade, the university not only included the College of Arts and Sciences, but also a School of Law (1914), a School of Dentistry (1914), and a College of Pharmacy (1919).
<p>With the discontinuance of the football program in the 1930s, more space became available for construction of new facilities.
Stallings Hall, built as a dedicated building for the College Of Business Administration, and the Memorial Library (now known as the &quot;Old Library&quot;) were constructed in the post <a>World War II</a> years, accommodating the growth of the student population.</p>
<p><a>Norman Francis</a> entered the Law School in 1952, becoming the first <a>African-American</a> admitted to the university.</p>
<p>More expansion continued in 1964, with the addition of the Joseph A. Danna <a>Student Center</a>; Albert Biever Hall, a <a>student residence</a> hall named after the first <a>university president</a>; and a central heating/cooling plant.
Built soon after in 1967 was Henrietta Buddig Hall, a student residence that is Loyola's tallest building at twelve stories.
The last building to be added in the 1960s was the J. Edgar Monroe Science Building (now known as Monroe Hall), the largest academic building erected to date.</p>
Reflecting the precedent for reform established by <a>Vatican II</a>, governance of the university shifted from a Jesuit regulated Board of Regents to a combined lay and clerical Board of Trustees.
During this period, the Common Curriculum was developed to give students a wide breadth of knowledge in certain core areas, including <a>Science</a>, <a>Math</a>, <a>History</a>, and <a>English</a>.
A broader trend was seen in the growth of the university during this period, seeing it gradually transform from a regional, largely commuter college to a higher national profile school that attracted students from across the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>In 1984 Loyola purchased the facilities of <a>St.
Mary&#x2019;s Dominican College</a>, a nearby Catholic women's college which was closing down, and transformed it into the Broadway campus (after the name of its street location).
Today, the Broadway campus includes Loyola's School of Law, Cabra Residence Hall, and a Department of Visual Arts.</p>
<p>Expansion in recent years has seen the addition of Mercy Hall, purchased in 1993, a former girl's preparatory academy; construction of Carrollton Hall, an upperclassman residence; and the J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library, the latter two completed in 1999.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities granted exclusive branding rights to <a>Loyola University Chicago</a> to call itself <em>Loyola University</em>.
<p>In August 2005, Loyola closed its campus and evacuated its students in anticipation of <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>.
Following cleanup, classes resumed on Monday, January 9, 2006.
Loyola held commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2006 on April 28&#x2013;29, becoming the first New Orleans college to do so post-Katrina.</p>
The plan restructured the University's colleges and eliminated several academic programs and faculty positions to reduce operating costs and revitalize the University.
&quot;PATHWAYS&quot; was widely criticized by students and staff who felt uninvolved in the decision-making process.
The Board of Trustees, however, unanimously approved and passed the plan on May 19, 2006.
In response, the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences produced a <a>vote of no-confidence</a> in both President Wildes and Provost Walter Harris.
Since the storm, Loyola has completed all physical repairs that were caused by the hurricane, and its enrollment is on a steady rise to pre-Katrina numbers.</p>
<h3>University Presidents</h3>
<p>There have been seventeen presidents since the establishment of Loyola College in 1904.
<h2>University Seal</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Seal of Loyola University New Orleans</a>The seal, which was adopted by the university in 1929, features the <a>coat of arms</a> of the house of Loyola with the emblem of the Society of Jesus at the top.
Ignatius Loyola</a>'s <a>family crest</a> and symbolize generosity (having enough to give to the wolves).
Above the figures of the wolves appears the <a>fleur-de-lis</a>, which represents the French origin of New Orleans and Louisiana.
Beneath it is a <a>pelican</a> feeding its young with her own blood; this ancient symbol of Christianity (Christ feeding the Church with his body and blood through the <a>Eucharist</a>) depicts Loyola as an institution of the state of Louisiana.</p>

The student to faculty ratio is 11 to 1. <a>The Princeton Review</a> features Loyola New Orleans in the 2010 edition of its annual book, <em>The Best 371 Colleges.</em></p>
Loyola professors have been recognized nationally and internationally by the <a>Pulitzer Committee</a>, the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, the <a>National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, and by numerous other associations.</p>
<li>College of Law</li>
<p>The College of Humanities and Natural Sciences focuses on areas concerning the natural sciences and liberal arts programs.
It contains the departments of English, history, languages, philosophy, religious studies, psychology, biology, liberal studies, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.
Also under the college's supervision is the Loyola Institute for Ministry (LIM).[<a>http://loyno.edu/strategicplan/documents/pathways051906finaledited.pdf</a>]
<p>The College of Social Sciences specializes in areas that deal with <a>the human condition</a>.
The College of Social Sciences contains the departments of counseling, criminal justice, human and organizational development, sociology, and political science.
The School of Mass Communication houses award winning programs in public relations, journalism and advertising.
<p>The College of Business began as an outgrowth of the College of Arts and Sciences and became a full fledged college in 1947.
In 1983, the College of Business was renamed in honor of Joseph A. Butt, S.J., a longtime Jesuit professor in the business college.
The College of Business is accredited by the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a> (AACSB), a prestigious honor awarded to only 450 business schools worldwide.
The college offers programs in the fields of economics, finance, international business, management, marketing, accounting and the business of music.</p>
<p>The College of Music was established when the <a>New Orleans</a> Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art was incorporated into the university in 1932.
It is the only <a>Jesuit</a> college of music in the <a>United States</a>.
In April 2007, the <a>Thelonious Monk</a> Institute of Jazz Performance announced its relocation to the College of Music and Fine Arts from the campus of the <a>University of Southern California</a>.
The Music Industry program was one of the first in the country, and combines both the performing and technical aspects of the music business.
<em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> called it the &quot;second best program in the nation&quot; for music business.</p>
<h4>College of Law</h4>
<p> Loyola's <a>law school</a> opened in 1914.
<a>Co-located</a> for many years on the main campus of Loyola, the Law School moved to the new Broadway campus in 1986, after Loyola purchased the closed campus of <a>St.
Mary&#x2019;s Dominican College</a> in 1984.
The School of Law was renamed the College of Law with the passage of the PATHWAYS Plan on May 19, 2006.</p>
<p>The University houses institutes in many different disciplines:</p>
<p>Loyola is located in the historic <a>Audubon Park District</a> on <a>St.
Its original campus, now called the Main Campus, was founded on a tract of land purchased by the New Orleans Jesuits in 1889.
The purchased portion of land was much larger than the current day campus; in fact, the original land purchase contained the land now occupied by both Loyola and <a>Tulane</a> universities and Audubon Place.
Through the next twenty years, portions of the original land purchase were sold to different entities to raise money for the new university, resulting in the current Main Campus area of 19 <a>acre</a>s.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, most of the original campus had been developed and the university looked around for areas where it could expand.
In the 1960s, J. Edgar Monroe, a major benefactor of the university, donated to Loyola a large undeveloped tract of land in <a>Metairie</a> where the university could either expand or move its entire location.
After reviewing its options, including the sale of the original campus to <a>Tulane University</a>, the university decided to remain on <a>St.
Charles Avenue</a>, subsequently selling off its property in Metairie in ten years as a condition of the donation.</p>
Mary's Dominican College</a> in 1984 provided an opportunity for Loyola to expand its campus.
After renovation of the closed college and some new construction, the Broadway Campus was opened in 1986, with several university offices and programs, the school of law most significantly, moving to the new campus.</p>
<p>Loyola's first campus, the Main Campus is located on <a>St.
Charles Avenue</a> across from <a>Audubon Park</a> and adjacent to <a>Tulane University</a>, which also fronts St. Charles.
According to <a>The Princeton Review</a> Loyola students get along well with members of the local community.
It is ranked #11 out of 371 Best Colleges for Great Town-Gown Relations.</p>
<p>The Main Campus contains the majority of the undergraduate academic divisions on campus, as well as serves as the hub of campus activities.
Fronting St. Charles is Marquette Hall, the oldest campus building, which serves as the iconic image of the university.
Several <a>quadrangles</a> organize the campus proceeding from the front of campus to its northern border at Freret Street, including the Academic quad, the Plaza De Los Martires De La Paz, or Peace Quad, named after the Salvadoran martyrs of 1989, and the Residential Quad.
Begun in 1907, it was finished in 1910.
After its completion, most of the classes of the college and later, the university were conducted in the building until the construction of Bobet Hall in the late 1920s.
The university's first library, the Bobet Library, was located on the third floor of Marquette Hall until the Memorial Library was constructed in the 1950s.
When the dentistry school began its operations, the fourth floor of Marquette was used partly as a <a>cadaver</a> dissection area, and an external <a>winch</a> was used to hoist the cadavers up the four floors.
Its music collection includes over 20,000 scores and recordings, and the special collections and archives include material concerning <a>Jesuits</a> in <a>New Orleans</a> and the <a>U.S. South</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Greenville Hall, built 1889, faces St. Charles Ave on the Broadway Campus</a>The former campus of <a>St.
Mary's Dominican College</a>, the  site was purchased by Loyola in 1984.
Greenville Hall, a <a>Registered Historic Place</a> built in 1889, forms the focus of the small campus, along with the College of Law building.</p>
<p>Loyola University New Orleans' Law Library is located in the College of Law building on the Broadway Campus.
It contains over 286,000 volumes and microfilm for the support of the students and faculty of the College of Law.
Due to the unique tradition of civil law in <a>Louisiana</a>, the library has substantial collections from civil law jurisdictions from around the world, including <a>France</a>, <a>Scotland</a>, and <a>Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>Loyola's Statement on Environmental Responsibility details the ways in which campus operations strives to maintain its facilities in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner.
<p>The student-run group Loyola University Community Action Program organizes the Environmental Action Program, which works to educate &amp; advocate for environmental justice on campus and in the Gulf Coast region.
<p>The epicenter of Loyola's on-campus life is the Dr.
Joseph A. Danna Center, built in 1964.
The Orleans Room, or as the students call it the O.R., Loyola's main cafeteria, is also housed in the building.
In 2008, the university completed a <a>US$</a>3 million renovation of the Danna Student Center under the guidance of Henry R. Mu&#x00f1;oz III, improving the organization and services of the building.</p>
<p>The university requires all students from outside the metropolitan New Orleans area to live on campus their first two years.
The Department of Residential Life manages the Residence Halls, and provides programming aimed at building community within the residence halls.
It was constructed in 1987 and paid for in full by <a>Freeport-McMoRan</a>.
The complex is situated on the fifth and sixth floors of the Freret Street <a>parking garage</a>.</p>
Okay to mention ACTUAL stuff that it has done which is not ordinary----&gt; The student body of Loyola is governed by a <a>Student Government Association (SGA)</a>.
<p>The Executive branch is headed by the President, which consists of the Executive Staff: Chief of Staff, Director of Public Relations, Director of Finance, etc.
The Chief of Staff organizes and maintains the hired staff and reports to the President.
The Director of Finance (in lieu with the Vice President) helps run the Budget Allocations process for chartered student organizations.
<p>The Legislative branch is run and maintained by the Vice President, who oversees all members of Senate: The Senior Senator at Large, Junior Senators at Large, College Presidents, Senators, and First-year (new student) Student Senators.
Members of Senate are divided up by the four (4) colleges: College of Business, College of Humanities and Natural Sciences, College of Music and Fine Arts, College of Social Sciences.</p>
<p>The Judicial Branch is headed by the Chief Justice, which consists of the Court of Review: Clerk of Court and Justices of the Court.
<p>The Loyola University Community Action Program, commonly referred to as LUCAP, was founded in 1975 by a student group led by Loyola students Robert Guasco and Mary Baudouin as an organization connecting students with <a>community service</a>, social justice, and advocacy work in New Orleans and abroad.
LUCAP partners with local <a>non-profit organization</a>s including <a>Habitat for Humanity</a>, <a>Green Light New Orleans</a>, and the <a>Gulf Restoration Network</a> to provide students with opportunities to serve in their community.
The organization cited Freeport's history of lack of regard for environmental quality and its history of <a>human rights violations</a> in the developing world.
Many students took a lead in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina through these service organizations.</p>
The last Greek organization to own a house was <a>Alpha Delta Gamma</a>, whose house burned in January 2006.
Since the burning of the ADG house on Freret Street, it has been demolished, just two blocks from Loyola's Main Campus.
<p>1540, a purported secret society, has been subjected to criticism for existing in violation of rules banning unchartered organizations.
<p>The student-run weekly newspaper, <em>The Maroon</em>, was established in 1923.
The Maroon has been nominated for the <a>Associated Collegiate Press</a>' <a>National Pacemaker Award</a> six times and won the award in 1983, 1986, 1998, 1999, and 2006.
Each semester, a small group of students intern for <em>The New Orleans Review</em>, an international journal of contemporary poetry, fiction, nonfiction, art, photography, film and book reviews, founded in 1968 and published by Loyola University.</p>
They currently participate in the <a>Southern States Athletic Conference</a>.
However, in 1991, the athletics program was reinstituted, amid student appeals for its reinstatement, including the aforementioned referendum.
<a>Spring Hill College</a> is also another rival in conference play.
The Pack Pride Committee was founded in 2007 to promote athletics and to encourage community members to be &quot;Proud to be Part of the 'Pack'&quot;.</p>
These include current and former members of the <a>United States House of Representatives</a>, members of the <a>Louisiana House of Representatives</a> and <a>Louisiana State Senate</a>, high ranking Presidential <a>United States Cabinet</a> officials, a former <a>Head of State</a>, a recipient of the <a>Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, and numerous music celebrities, including opera star <a>Norman Treigle</a>.
The university is also home to a number of high profile professors, including <a>Walter Block</a>, the <a>free market</a> economist and <a>anarcho-capitalist</a> associated with the <a>Austrian School</a>.</p>
Francis</a></strong>, president of <a>Xavier University of Louisiana</a>, receives <a>Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, 2006.
<p><img> The College of Pharmacy was closed in 1965, while the School of Dentistry closed in 1970.
