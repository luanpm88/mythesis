<p>At its founding, the school was affiliated with the conservative General Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America.
<p>Chartered by the state of Ohio and accredited by the Ohio Board of Regents, Cedarville University is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cedarville University was chartered in 1887 by the Presbyterian church; at the time, the surrounding township was largely Presbyterian.
The first classes were held in 1892, though the college did not officially open until 1894.
<p>Elements of the school's heritage remain on today's campus in the form of two original buildings: Founder's Hall (Old Main) and Collins Hall (Science Building).</p>
<p>In 1953, the Baptist Bible Institute of Cleveland relocated and transitioned into management of Cedarville College through a merger arrangement with the college's Presbyterian board of trustees, who each resigned in turn.
The Baptists were affiliated with the <a>General Association of Regular Baptist Churches</a>, a fundamentalist group which later dissociated itself from the college.</p>
<p>The university's seal has remained essentially unchanged from the Presbyterians' original design and still contains the Latin phrase 'Pro Corona et Foedere Christi,' which is translated, 'For the crown and covenant of Christ.'
The original seal is surrounded with a slogan adopted by the former Baptist Bible Institute, 'For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ.'</p>
It also offers 40 minors, including a Bible minor, which is required for all students.
The university also awards a limited number of graduate degrees in the areas of education and pharmacy (pending accreditation by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education).
In November 2009, the university announced the addition of a <a>Master of Science in Nursing</a> (M.S.N.) degree beginning in the fall of 2010, pending accreditation and approval by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the Ohio Board of Regents.
A full list of programs offered is <a>here.</a></p>
<p>Cedarville's teaching body is composed of 197 full-time faculty members who profess to be Christians and support the University's <a>doctrinal statement</a>.
The university integrates a Biblical worldview into each discipline.
The university is organized into five schools:  the School of Biblical and Theological Studies, the School of Humanities, the School of Natural and Applied Sciences, the School of Pharmacy, and the School of Social Science and Human Performance.</p>
<p>According to its mission statement, the University is, &quot;a Christ-centered learning community equipping students for lifelong leadership and service through an education marked by excellence and grounded in biblical truth.&quot;</p>
<p>With a stated goal of &quot;helping [the student] increasingly reflect the character of God in [his or her] life,&quot; Cedarville University is a religious university.
<p><a>thumb|right|Dixon Ministry Center</a> The university's original campus and facilities are in the Village of Cedarville.
Since about 1970, the school has purchased and consolidated surrounding farm lands which now total approximately 400 acres to the north and west of the village.</p>
Among the few turn-of-the-century structures are Founders Hall, which houses the president's office and administrative functions, and  Collins Hall&#x2014;which houses the Department of History and Government, Travel Study Office, and today contains but one classroom.</p>
The university has nine residences for men and seven for women.
All of these dormitories have coed lounges, except for the cluster of male dorms know as &quot;The Hill&quot;.
Some students live in a <a>suite</a>-like setting, with three to four bedrooms sharing a comparatively small lounge in each unit.
Others live in a single-room, hall-style format with a communal lounge on each floor.</p>

B. Eye</em>, the only known archives of which are in the Cedarville University library and in the Louisiana Serials list.
