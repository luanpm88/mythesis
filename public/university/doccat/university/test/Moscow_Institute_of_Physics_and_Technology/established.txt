<p>   <strong>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)</strong> (), <a>abbreviated</a> <strong>MIPT</strong>, <strong>MIPT (SU)</strong> or informally <strong>Phystech</strong>  (alternative transliterations: MFTI, Fizteh; ) is a leading <a>Russia</a>n university, originally established in the <a>Soviet Union</a>.
It prepares specialists in theoretical and applied physics, applied mathematics, and related disciplines.
It is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Russian <a>MIT</a>.&quot;</p>
With its emphasis on practical research in the educational process, MIPT &quot;outsources&quot; education and research beyond the first two or three years to institutions of the <a>Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.
This effectively hides MIPT from the academic radar, an effect not unwelcome during the <a>Cold War</a> era when leading scientists and engineers of the Soviet arms and space programs studied there.</p>
<p>The word &quot;phystech,&quot; without the capital P, is also used in <a>Russian</a> to refer to Phystech students and graduates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|MIPT campus</a> In late 1945 and early 1946, a group of prominent Soviet scientists, including in particular the future Nobel Prize winner <a>Pyotr Kapitsa</a>, lobbied the government for the creation of a higher educational institution radically different from the type established in the Soviet system of higher education.
<p>In a letter to <a>Stalin</a> in February 1946, Kapitsa argued for the need for such a school, which he tentatively called the <em>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</em>, to better maintain and develop the country's defense potential.
The institute would follow the principles outlined above, and was supposed to be governed by a board of directors of the leading research institutes of the <a>USSR Academy of Sciences</a>.
On March 10, 1946, the government issued a decree mandating the establishment of a &quot;College of Physics and Technology&quot; ().</p>
<p>For unknown reasons, the initial plan came to a halt in the summer of 1946.
Instead, a new government decree was issued on November 25, 1946 establishing the new school as a Department of Physics and Technology within <a>Moscow State University</a>.
November 25 is celebrated as the date of MIPT's founding.</p>
Kapitsa foresaw that within a traditional educational institution, the new school would encounter bureaucratic obstacles, but even though Kapitsa's original plan to create the new school as an independent organization did not come to fruition exactly as envisioned, its most important principles survived intact.
Its facilities were in Dolgoprudny (the two buildings it occupied are still part of the present day campus), away from the MSU campus.
It had its own independent admissions and education system, different from the one centrally mandated for all other universities.
It was headed by the MSU &quot;vice rector for special issues&quot;--a position created specifically to shield the department from the University management.
<p>As Kapitsa expected, the special status of the new school with its different &quot;rules of engagement&quot; caused much consternation and resistance within the university.
The immediate cult status that Phystech gained among talented young people, drawn by the challenge and romanticism of working on the forefront of science and technology, and on projects of &quot;government importance,&quot; many of them classified, made it an untouchable rival of every other school in the country, including MSU's own Department of Physics.
At the same time, the increasing disfavor of Kapitsa with the government (in 1950 he was essentially under house arrest), and anti-semitic repressions of the late 40's made Phystech an easy target of intrigues and accusations of &quot;elitism&quot; and &quot;<a>rootless cosmopolitanism</a>.&quot;
In the summer of 1951, the Phystech department at MSU was shut down.</p>
<p>A group of academicians, backed by Air Force general Ivan Fedorovich Petrov, who was a Phystech supporter influential enough to secure Stalin's personal approval on the issue, succeeded in re-establishing Phystech as an independent institute.
On September 17, 1951, a government decree re-established Phystech as the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.</p>
<p>Apart from Kapitsa, other prominent scientists who taught at MIPT in the years that followed included Nobel prize winners <a>Nikolay Semyonov</a>, <a>Lev Landau</a>, <a>Alexandr Prokhorov</a>, <a>Vitaly Ginzburg</a>; and Academy of Sciences members <a>Sergey Khristianovich</a>, <a>Mikhail Lavrentiev</a>, <a>Mstislav Keldysh</a>, <a>Sergey Korolyov</a>, and <a>Boris Rauschenbach</a>.
MIPT alumni include <a>Andre Geim</a> and <a>Konstantin Novoselov</a>, the 2010 winners of the <a>Nobel Prize for Physics</a>.
<p>The following is a summary of the key principles of the Phystech System, as outlined by Kapitsa in his 1946 letter arguing for the founding of MIPT:</p>
<li>Rigorous selection of gifted and creative young individuals.</li>
<li>Involving leading scientists in student education, in close contact with them in their creative environment.</li>
<li>An individualized approach to encourage the cultivation of students' creative drive, and to avoid overloading them with unnecessary subjects and rote learning common in other schools and necessitated by mass education.</li>
<p>In its implementation, the Phystech System combines highly competitive admissions, extensive fundamental education in mathematics, as well as theoretical and experimental physics in the undergraduate years, and immersion in research work at leading research institutions of the <a>Russian Academy of Sciences</a> starting as early as the second or third year.</p>
<li><a>Radio Engineering and Cybernetics</a></li>
<li><a>General and Applied Physics</a></li>
<li><a>Molecular and Biological Physics</a></li>
<li><a>Physical and Quantum Electronics</a></li>
<li><a>Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering</a></li>
<li><a>Applied Mathematics and Management </a></li>
<li><a>Problems of Physics and Power Engineering</a></li>
<li><a>Innovation and High Technology</a></li>
<p>Most students apply to MIPT immediately after graduating from high school at the age of 17. Child prodigies are occasionally admitted at a younger age after skipping grades in school.
<p>Traditionally, applicants were required to take written and oral exams in both mathematics and physics, write an essay, and have an interview with the faculty.
<p>In accordance with the traditions of the <a>Soviet education system</a>, education at MIPT is free for most students.
Further, students receive small <a>scholarships</a> (as of <a>2009</a>, $75&#x2013;$90 per month, depending on the student's performance), and effectively free housing on campus, which allows them to study full time.</p>
<p><a>thumb|A student studying the class schedule</a> It normally takes six years for a student to graduate from MIPT.
The curriculum of the first three years consists exclusively of required courses, with emphasis on mathematics, physics, and English.
A typical course load during the first and second years can be over 48 hours a week, not including homework.
Each semester includes 15 weeks of instruction, two weeks of finals, and then three weeks of oral and written exams on the most important subjects covered in the preceding semester.</p>
In other words, a base organization is an extension of MIPT, specializing in each particular student's area of interests.
Defending the thesis is a requirement for graduation.</p>
<li>Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics of RAS</li>
<li>and a number of <a>OKB</a>s (experimental design bureaux)</li>
<p>In addition, a number of Russian and Western companies act as base organizations of MIPT.
Upon successful graduation, they were awarded a <a>specialist degree</a> in Applied Mathematics and Physics and, beginning in the early 90s, a <a>Master's degree</a> in Physics.
<p>Since 1998, students have been awarded a <a>Bachelor's degree</a> diploma after four years of study and the defense of a Bachelor's &quot;qualification work&quot; (effectively a smaller and less involved version of the Master's <a>thesis</a>).
<p>The complete course of education at MIPT takes six years to complete, just like an American <a>Bachelor's degree</a> followed by a <a>Master's degree</a>.
Most out-of-town students live in the dormitory on campus for at least the first 4 years.
Many senior students move to another dormitory in <a>Moscow</a>, while some either move to base institute dormitories or rent apartments.</p>
<p>The student population is almost exclusively male, with the female/male ratio in a department rarely exceeding 15% (seeing 2-3 women in a class of 80 is not uncommon).
Although in recent years this situation has changed and in 2009 more than 20% of first year students were females.</p>
In the past, some students were known to have been admitted into Ph.D. programs of American universities as early as after their 3rd year of education.
Many MIPT alumni hold faculty positions in the world's top Universities, including <a>Harvard</a>, <a>MIT</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Brown</a>, and <a>University of Chicago</a>.</p>
