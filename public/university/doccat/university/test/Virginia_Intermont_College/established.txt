<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reverend J.R. Harrison, a Baptist minister, envisioned bringing higher education opportunities to women in southwest Virginia and saw it come to fruition when the <strong>Southwest Virginia Institute</strong> in <a>Glade Spring, Virginia</a> opened on September 17, 1884.
Instructing both boarding and day students, the school steadily grew until it outgrew its facilities in less than ten years.</p>
<p>The college began moving to a new site in Bristol, Virginia in 1891, completing its relocation with the beginning of classes on September 14, 1893.
Shortly after the move, the name was changed to <strong>Virginia Institute</strong>.
A reorganization of the curriculum in 1910 brought the college in line with the <a>junior college</a> movement and the college became the first two-year institution to be accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
The school's name changed to its present name, <strong>Virginia Intermont College</strong>, in 1908.
&quot;Intermont&quot;, meaning &quot;among the mountains&quot;, is evocative of the college's location in the mountains.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw construction of five buildings on campus to accommodate the school's growth.
In May 1968, the college's Board of Trustees approved a plan for the development of a four-year institution.
1972 ushered in two major changes at Intermont, the awarding of the school's first baccalaureate degrees and the admission of men.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2007, it was announced by the college's administration that the financial situation at the college has declined to critical levels and the college lacked the funds to offer faculty members contracts for the 2007-08 academic year, prompting pleas for donations and talk of merger with another college.
On June 18, 2007, the college president announced that enough funding had been secured to extend faculty contracts for the 2007-08 school year.
<p>Virginia Intermont College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097: Telephone number 404-679-4500) to award the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Work, Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degrees.</p>
<p>In 2007, the college was denied reaffirmation and placed on probation by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
After being on probation for two years, the college was removed from probation on June 25, 2009.</p>
<p>Virginia Intermont's accreditation was last reaffirmed in 1997 and the institution will next go through the reaffirmation process in 2011..</p>
