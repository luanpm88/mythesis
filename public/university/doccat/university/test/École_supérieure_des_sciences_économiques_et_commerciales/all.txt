established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|200px|right|First ESSEC Graduates, class of 1909.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>ESSEC's flagship postgraduate programme is its Master of Science in Management, designed for students with no professional experience (instead of managers with 3&#x2013;5 years of experience like US or UK <a>MBA</a> programs).
established$$$@@@%%%The diploma is only delivered upon completion of a required amount of time spent in internships.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Admission process</h4>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Along with HEC Paris, ESSEC is one of the two top schools among the Business <em><a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em>, and as such it requires passing a selective entrance examination, the &quot;Concours Grandes Ecoles&quot;.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It takes place between May and June.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%Every year, ESSEC recruits about 360 students through this examination process.
established$$$@@@%%%Most of the students who sit for the entrance examination come from the French &#x201c;<a>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a>&#x201d;, also called &#x201c;classes pr&#x00e9;pa&#x201d;.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The &#x201c;classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires&#x201d; last two years and their only purpose is to prepare students for the French Business Schools&#x2019; selective entrance examination.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>ESSEC, along with many other business schools, tests the candidates on their knowledge in mathematics, economics, history, philosophy, general culture and languages.
established$$$@@@%%%The candidates must also pass a series of oral exams in order to enter the school.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p> Many students in &quot;classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires&quot; choose not to pass the ESSEC exam because they consider it is too difficult.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%There are approximately 16,000 undergraduate students who follow this academic training known as &quot;pr&#x00e9;pa &#x00e9;conomiques et commerciales&quot;.</p>
