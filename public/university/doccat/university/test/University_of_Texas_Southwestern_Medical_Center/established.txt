<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|265px|Southwestern Medical College as it appeared at its founding in the 1940s.
Under the leadership of Dr. Edward H. Cary and Karl Hoblitzelle, a group of prominent Dallas citizens organized <a>Southwestern Medical Foundation</a> in 1939 to promote medical education and research in Dallas and the region.
When <a>Baylor University</a> elected to move its school of medicine from Dallas to Houston in 1943, the foundation formally established Southwestern Medical College as the 68th medical school in the United States.
Founded during <a>World War II</a>, the medical school was initially housed in a handful of abandoned barracks.</p>
<p>When a new state medical school was proposed after World War II, leaders of Southwestern Medical Foundation offered the college's equipment, library and certain restricted funds to <a>The University of Texas System</a>, provided the university would locate its new medical branch in Dallas.
The Board of Regents accepted this offer from the foundation, and in 1949 the college became Southwestern Medical School of The University of Texas.
In 1954 the name was changed to The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School.
The present campus site on <a>Harry Hines Boulevard</a> was occupied in 1955 upon the completion of the Edward H. Cary Building.
This placed the medical school faculty next to the newly built <a>Parkland Memorial Hospital</a>.
The school's tuition is just over $13,000 per year for in-state residents, being subsidized by the state.
By mandate of the state legislature, 90 percent of students are from the state of <a>Texas</a>, in order to assure the state a consistent source of high-quality physicians.
For out-of-state residents, the school offers institution grants and alumni scholarships to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Graduates of UT Southwestern have amongst the lowest amounts of student loan debt at the time of matriculation (average debt of grads from Southwestern is $75,400 according to the 2008 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>).
<p>UT Southwestern medical students manage <a>The Monday Clinic</a>, a free weekly clinic in East Dallas, under the supervision of Dallas-area physicians.
UTSW students also have the opportunity to volunteer at the <a>Agape Clinic</a>, a free weekly dermatology clinic in Dallas, and <a>Camp Sweeney</a>, a summer camp in North Texas for children with diabetes.</p>
Notably, Thomson <a>ScienceWatch</a>, which quantifies citations-per-paper for work published between 2005&#x2013;2009, ranked UTSW 1st in the world for published research in Clinical Medicine, 1st in Biology &amp; Biochemistry, 2nd in Neurobiology/Behavior, and 3rd in Molecular Biology/Genetics.
<p>The <a>Center for Measuring University Performance</a> which ranks American Universities using a system of 9 measures put UT Southwestern in the top 26-50 category.</p>
<p>UTSW's research faculty includes 18 members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>, 13 members of the <a>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>, and three active <a>Nobel Laureates</a>.
Dr. Alfred Gilman retired from UTSW in 2009 to become the Chief Scientific Officer of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.</p>
<p>UT Southwestern runs a competitive <a>MD/PhD program</a>, part of the NIH <a>Medical Scientist Training Program</a>.
Dr. Brown is involved with the administration of the program, and attends the weekly &quot;Works-in-Progress&quot; talks given by research faculty.
The low <a>cost of living</a> in Dallas  may be an attraction for students.</p>
