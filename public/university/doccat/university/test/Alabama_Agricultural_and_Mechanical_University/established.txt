A&amp;M was originally established by an act of the Alabama State Legislature in 1873 as the State Normal School and University for the Education of the Colored Teachers and Students.
Peyton Finley introduced twin bills in the State Board of Education for the establishment of four &quot;normal&quot; schools for whites and four for blacks in 1875.
In that same year, William Hooper Councill became founder of Alabama A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>By 1878, the state appropriation increased to $2,000 and the school changed its name to the State Normal and Industrial School.
Industrial training began in 1883.
In 1885, the name was changed to State Normal and Industrial School of Huntsville.</p>
<p>By 1890, the students numbered 300, with 11 teachers, the school site became known as Normal, Alabama, and a post office was established.
In 1891, the school was designated as a land-grant college through legislative enactment February 13 and received funds as a land-grant college under the terms of the <a>Morrill Act of 1890</a>.
The name was changed to the State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes.

On May 1, 1875, the school opened with a state appropriation of $1,000, 61 pupils, and two teachers at its first location on Clinton Street in <a>Huntsville</a>.

In 1947, the library was enlarged 5,000 square feet (460 m&#x00b2;), which reflected the college's growth.
So rapid was the college's student growth that they even outgrew the nearly 10,000 square foot (930 m&#x00b2;) library, and in 1962, a new Reference Annex was added.
