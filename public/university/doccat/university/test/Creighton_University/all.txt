established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was founded as Creighton College on September 2, 1878 through a gift from <a>Mary Lucretia Creighton</a>, who stipulated in her will that a school be established in memory of her husband, prominent Omaha businessman <a>Edward Creighton</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Edward's brother, <a>John A. Creighton</a>, is credited with fostering and sustaining the university's early growth and endowment.
established$$$@@@%%%The Creighton brothers came to Omaha in 1854.
established$$$@@@%%%Edward surveyed the route for the transcontinental telegraph and supervised its construction west from Julesburg, Colorado.
nickname$$$@@@%%%His subsequent business ventures in freighting, ranching, railroading and banking became a major force in the economic development of Omaha.
established$$$@@@%%%Edward died in 1874 and his widow, Mary Lucretia Creighton, who inherited his fortune, included $100,000 in her will for the purpose of establishing a school in memory of her husband.
established$$$@@@%%%She specifically directed that the school be &quot;in the city of Omaha,&quot; &quot;of the class and grade of a college.&#x201d;
established$$$@@@%%%She died in 1876 and her executors, who included her brother-in-law, John Creighton, purchased  of land at the northwest corner of 24th and California Streets.
established$$$@@@%%%On that site they erected a school building and then transferred the land, the building, and additional securities to the Right Rev. James O'Connor, D.D., Bishop of Omaha, on July 1, 1878.
staff$$$@@@%%%That land and that building are still part of Creighton University.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Bishop O'Connor asked the Jesuits to operate the college that same year and the University's first president, Rev. Romanus A. Shaffel, S.J., arrived in Omaha in July and the school was opened on September 2, 1878.
established$$$@@@%%%One priest, three scholastics, a layman and woman formed the faculty when classes began.
established$$$@@@%%%On August 14, 1879, Bishop O'Connor surrendered his trust to the Missouri Province of Jesuits that incorporated &quot;The Creighton University&quot; under Nebraska law.
established$$$@@@%%%Because at the time of its opening there were few institutions in Omaha that prepared their students for college level work, much of the initial teaching in the college was at a secondary school level.
established$$$@@@%%%It was not until 13 years later, in 1891, that the first baccalaureate degree was awarded.
