<p><strong>DigiPen Institute of Technology</strong> is a a <a>for-profit</a> <a>college</a> located in <a>Redmond, Washington</a> which has a focus on computer science, computer engineering, and art with emphasis in creating <a>video game</a>s.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>DigiPen Institute of Technology was founded in 1988 by Claude Comair in Vancouver, B.C., Canada as  DigiPen Corporation, a computer simulation and animation company.</p>
<p>In 1990, Digipen began offering a 3D animation program and collaborates with Nintendo of America to create a post-secondary program for video game programming.
<p>In May 1996 the Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board granted DigiPen the ability to award an Associate and Bachelor of Science Degrees in <a>Real-Time Interactive Simulation</a> and an Associate of Applied Arts Degree in <a>3D Computer Animation</a>.
This made DigiPen the first university in the world dedicated to computer and video game development.
<p>The school offered its first Associate of Applied Arts in 3D Computer Animation degrees in 1999.</p>
The BS.c in Real-Time Interactive Simulation program than proceeded to be DigiPen Flagship course, renowned for the highly skill game programmer the intensive program creates.</p>
<p>The school added BS.c in Computer Engineering, BF.a in Production Animation and MS.c in Computer Science programs in 2004.
In 2008, the BS.c in Game Design and BF.a in Game Design programs were added.</p>
<p>A sister campus in Singapore started in 2008 and since 2010 in <a>Bilbao (Spain)</a></p>
<p>DigiPen consisted of two campuses, the Main Campus and the Art Campus.</p>
<p>The Main Campus was part of a rented building from <a>Nintendo of America</a>.
The top floor was mostly DigiPen, with <a>Nintendo Software Technology</a> on the north-east quarter.
In 2002, DigiPen expanded its hold on the second floor by acquiring approximately another quarter, adding four new classrooms and a new place for the library.
<p>The newer addition to DigiPen was the Art Campus, located about two miles (3&nbsp;km) away from the Main Campus near Redmond Town Center.
This new campus has over , allowing the school to increase the size of the student body by up to 300 students.
<p>Digipen Singapore is recognized by the Singapore Ministry of Education as a foreign specialized institution.
<p>As of 2010, Digipen Singapore started a collaboration with the <a>Singapore Institute of Technology</a> with the Digipen Bachelor of the Arts &amp; Science program.
The school received the first batch of joint students in Fall 2010.</p>
Compared to a standard computer science curriculum, students start  a very rigorous course with <a>C</a>, advance to object oriented programming with <a>C++</a>, and all take 2D Windows GUI, 3D graphics and <a>sockets networking</a>.
Starting in the fall of 2008, DigiPen began offering a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Game Design.
DigiPen also offers a <a>master's degree</a> in computer science, and Comair plans to add a <a>Ph.D.</a> program as well.</p>
Additionally, DigiPen students have placed the largest number of student projects in the <a>Independent Games Festival</a> student showcase every year since it began, with a seven-year total of 24 awards given to 23 winning game projects.
The next three closest institutions have placed five, four and three games in the showcase over six years.</p>
Each term is 15 weeks long, including a mid-term exam week and a final term exam week.
Term 1 generally runs from late August to early December, while Term 2 begins in January and ends in April.
Term 3 begins in May and end in July.
The Professors and Lecturers have no problems having the students calling them by name.
<p>It has also been noted by students in DigiPen about the high number or retain and drop-out rate as grades are distributed on a absolute scale and no bell-curve was used.
It is possible for an entire under performing class to collectively fail a module together.
Starting in 2004, Freshman year DigiPen students work with an in-house <a>integrated development environment</a> (IDE) called the FUNEditor to develop a 2D graphical game.
Second semester developing a <a>text-based game</a> over the course of the semester.
Junior year requires that games feature <a>3D Rendering</a>, and often serve as the first real experimentation with physics, artificial intelligence, and networking.

<li>Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation</li>
<p>Different departments in DigiPen focus in different aspect of game development.
A wide range of courses is offered to covered for a wholesome education.
Each department in DigiPen is normally chaired by a Professor or one who have been in long history in the related topic.</p>
<h4>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</h4>
<h4>Department of Game Design and Production</h4>
<h4>Department of Humanities and Social Sciences</h4>
<li>HIS: History</li>
<li>LAW: Law</li>
These classes focus on hands-on teaching philosophies.
The junior level covers two tiers of game design and one tier of animation, which are designed to prepare students for the major classes intended for grades 8 and above by introducing children to less of the technical studies and more of the concepts and ideas behind these courses.</p>
<p>The Robotics Lv. 2 &amp; Game Design class has been added since in the 2010 Summer Workshop.</p>
<li>DigiPen was ranked 3736th out of around 20000 world colleges and universities by <a>Webometrics</a> in July 2010.</li>
