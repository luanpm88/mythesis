However, it was uncertain how this division will impact cooperation between the RTIS and BFA students during future student projects.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
Though there are liberal arts classes also in the curriculum, all required courses are pertinent to game development.
The CEC handles tournaments, movies, and other activities.</p>
The relative small size of each class also ensures that the Professors and Lecturers knows the student names by heart.
It is noted that there are no sports team or clubs hosted by the school as its unofficially known by all students that time not spent studying is either to be used playing games or developing their own pet game projects.</p>
Senior year students are significantly less restricted to allow for more artistic control, essentially allowing the students to focus on their specialization or the game's design.</p>
These same courses are available to everyone to take during the summer for a fee.</p>
