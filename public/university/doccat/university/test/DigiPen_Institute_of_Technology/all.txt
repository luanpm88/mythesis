established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>DigiPen Institute of Technology</strong> is a a <a>for-profit</a> <a>college</a> located in <a>Redmond, Washington</a> which has a focus on computer science, computer engineering, and art with emphasis in creating <a>video game</a>s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>DigiPen Institute of Technology was founded in 1988 by Claude Comair in Vancouver, B.C., Canada as  DigiPen Corporation, a computer simulation and animation company.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1990, Digipen began offering a 3D animation program and collaborates with Nintendo of America to create a post-secondary program for video game programming.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%With Nintendo's support in 1994, DigiPen Applied Computer Graphics School accepts its first class of video game programming students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In May 1996 the Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board granted DigiPen the ability to award an Associate and Bachelor of Science Degrees in <a>Real-Time Interactive Simulation</a> and an Associate of Applied Arts Degree in <a>3D Computer Animation</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This made DigiPen the first university in the world dedicated to computer and video game development.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The Real-Time Interactive Simulation program then proceeded to be Digipen's Flagship course, renowned for the highly skilled game programmers the intensive program creates.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The school relocated to Redmond, Washington, U.S. in January 1998.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school offered its first Associate of Applied Arts in 3D Computer Animation degrees in 1999.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2000, DigiPen awarded the first class of R.T.I.S graduates.
established$$$@@@%%%The BS.c in Real-Time Interactive Simulation program than proceeded to be DigiPen Flagship course, renowned for the highly skill game programmer the intensive program creates.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school added BS.c in Computer Engineering, BF.a in Production Animation and MS.c in Computer Science programs in 2004.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2008, the BS.c in Game Design and BF.a in Game Design programs were added.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A sister campus in Singapore started in 2008 and since 2010 in <a>Bilbao (Spain)</a></p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Campus</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Main Campus</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>DigiPen consisted of two campuses, the Main Campus and the Art Campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Main Campus was part of a rented building from <a>Nintendo of America</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The bottom floor is Nintendo of America's warehouse where games and game systems are shipped out.
established$$$@@@%%%The top floor was mostly DigiPen, with <a>Nintendo Software Technology</a> on the north-east quarter.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2002, DigiPen expanded its hold on the second floor by acquiring approximately another quarter, adding four new classrooms and a new place for the library.
type$$$@@@%%%Two-thirds of the rooms were filled with computers for student use &#x2014; only one-third were lecture halls without computers.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The newer addition to DigiPen was the Art Campus, located about two miles (3&nbsp;km) away from the Main Campus near Redmond Town Center.
nickname$$$@@@%%%DigiPen opened this new campus at the beginning of the Fall 2007 semester to provide classrooms for all the BFA students, and to accommodate the growing student body.
mascot$$$@@@%%%However, it was uncertain how this division will impact cooperation between the RTIS and BFA students during future student projects.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>As of August 2010, DigiPen has moved both computer science and art students to a new, integrated campus in North Redmond, at 9931 Willows Rd.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%NE.
established$$$@@@%%%This new campus has over , allowing the school to increase the size of the student body by up to 300 students.
type$$$@@@%%%It features many amenities, such as art and computer labs, a cafeteria with a professional kitchen, and a general store.</p>

mascot$$$@@@%%%<h2>Education</h2>
website$$$@@@%%%<p>DigiPen has three primary educational paths: Real Time Interactive Simulation (Game/Software Development &amp; Programming), Computer Engineering, and Applied/Fine Arts.
established$$$@@@%%%Compared to a standard computer science curriculum, students start  a very rigorous course with <a>C</a>, advance to object oriented programming with <a>C++</a>, and all take 2D Windows GUI, 3D graphics and <a>sockets networking</a>.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Many students build robotic vehicles as projects.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The art programs are taught from a computer-oriented perspective, though many art students do not intend to work in the game industry and attend DigiPen for its unique curriculum and businesslike atmosphere.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%RTIS students are taught aspects of development including programming, design, and marketing.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Though there are liberal arts classes also in the curriculum, all required courses are pertinent to game development.
established$$$@@@%%%Starting in the fall of 2008, DigiPen began offering a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Game Design.
established$$$@@@%%%DigiPen also offers a <a>master's degree</a> in computer science, and Comair plans to add a <a>Ph.D.</a> program as well.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Students</h2>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>DigiPen is the only educational institution whose students have been nominated in the professional category at the <a>Independent Games Festival</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Additionally, DigiPen students have placed the largest number of student projects in the <a>Independent Games Festival</a> student showcase every year since it began, with a seven-year total of 24 awards given to 23 winning game projects.
established$$$@@@%%%The next three closest institutions have placed five, four and three games in the showcase over six years.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%Peer support in campus is extensive, student gladly help each other and there is even an unofficial DigiPen Survival Guide written by the senior students.
mascot$$$@@@%%%It is noted that there are no sports team or clubs hosted by the school as its unofficially known by all students that time not spent studying is either to be used playing games or developing their own pet game projects.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<h2>Student work (games)</h2>
doctoral$$$@@@%%%<p>Each year RTIS students are formed into teams ranging from 4-8 developers.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Art students are not required to work on the game projects but are awarded credit for participating in Junior level or higher projects.
established$$$@@@%%%Starting in 2004, Freshman year DigiPen students work with an in-house <a>integrated development environment</a> (IDE) called the FUNEditor to develop a 2D graphical game.
established$$$@@@%%%Second semester developing a <a>text-based game</a> over the course of the semester.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%Sophomore year, students game teams develop <a>graphical games</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Junior year requires that games feature <a>3D Rendering</a>, and often serve as the first real experimentation with physics, artificial intelligence, and networking.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Senior year students are significantly less restricted to allow for more artistic control, essentially allowing the students to focus on their specialization or the game's design.</p>
