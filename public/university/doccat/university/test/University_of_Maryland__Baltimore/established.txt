<h2>Name of the Institution</h2>
<p>The professional schools housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore may also simply use the name &quot;University of Maryland&quot; when describing themselves even though the <a>University of Maryland, College Park</a> also refers to itself simply as the University of Maryland.
There is relatively little confusion resulting from the shared name because the University of Maryland, College Park offers largely research-oriented graduate programs and houses fewer professional schools.
By law and tradition each school is entitled to use the &quot;University of Maryland&quot; name in recognition of their shared history.
<p>The University of Maryland, Baltimore is also often mistaken for the <a>University of Maryland, Baltimore County</a> (UMBC), which is a separate University System of Maryland institution located in the town of <a>Catonsville</a>, outside the City of Baltimore.</p>
