<h2>History</h2>
<p>Created by legislation signed by Governor <a>Oran M. Roberts</a> on April 21, 1879, <strong>Sam Houston Normal Institute</strong><em>'s dedicated goal was to train teachers for the public schools of Texas&mdash;the first of its kind in the <a>southwestern United States</a>.
On October 10 of the same year, the first class of 110 students and four faculty commenced instruction on the site of what had once been the campus of <a>Austin College</a>.</em></p>
<p>When the university first opened, students received a certification to teach in the state's elementary and secondary schools, but after 1919, the university began to award bachelor's degrees.
In 1936, the school awarded its first post-baccalaureate degree.
<p>The university celebrated its 125th year in 2004.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of its history, Sam has undergone several name changes.</p>
<li>April 21, 1879, founded as <strong>Sam Houston Normal Institute</strong></li>
<li>1923: <strong>Sam Houston State Teachers College</strong></li>
<li>1965: <strong>Sam Houston State College</strong></li>
<li>1969: Sam Houston State University</li>
<p>In 2007, a proposal was briefly considered to change the school's name to <strong>Texas State University - Sam Houston</strong> (intending to associate the campus more with the <a>Texas State University System</a> of which it is a member).
However, In April, 2007, Texas House Bill 1418 passed without objection in the Texas Legislature; the bill prevents the Texas State University System&#x2019;s board of regents from changing the university's name.</p>
<p>Sam Houston State University sits on  in the central area of Huntsville, Texas.
Recent construction of an expanded mall area of campus includes benches, tables, wireless internet, and more greenspace in the heart of campus.
<p>The campus stood in for the fictional Austin University in the motion picture <em><a>The Life of David Gale</a></em>.</p>
<p>The College of Criminal Justice includes the headquarters of the <a>Texas Forensic Science Commission</a>.</p>
<li><a>College of Business Administration</a></li>
<li><a>College of Criminal Justice</a></li>
<li><a>College of Humanities and Social Sciences</a></li>
<p>Sam's programs in <a>criminal justice</a> are frequently mentioned given the school's long relationship with the <a>Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a>, which is headquartered in Huntsville, also housing the state's execution chamber (<a>death row</a> is located at the <a>Allan B. Polunsky Unit</a> in <a>Livingston</a> to the east of Huntsville).
Recently, the Department of <a>History</a> and School of Music are experiencing growth, the latter attracting performers to its music education program.
Additionally, many students choose to go to Sam because of its <a>education</a> program.</p>
<p>The university boasts one of the oldest speech and debate programs in the nation.
<p>Recently, the university has embraced technology offering both bachelor's and master's degrees via the web in several areas, including <a>history</a> and <a>criminal justice</a>.
<p>Sam Houston State University is the host institution for the <a>Online Picasso Project</a>, under the directorship of Dr. Enrique Mallen.</p>
SHSU's primary rival is <a>Stephen F. Austin State University</a> and tensions between the two schools can run high before major sporting events that pit one against the other.
<a>Texas State University&#x2013;San Marcos</a> is also another rival in the <a>Southland Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Alcalde</em> is the university's annual yearbook, published from 1910&#x2013;1998 and 2003&#x2013;present; it was named in honor of Texas Governor <a>Oran Roberts</a> whose nickname was &quot;The Old <a>Alcalde</a>.&quot;</p>
