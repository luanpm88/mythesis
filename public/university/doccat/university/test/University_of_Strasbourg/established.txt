<p>The <strong>University of Strasbourg</strong> in <a>Strasbourg</a>, <a>Alsace</a>, <a>France</a>, is the largest university in France, with about 43,000 students and over 4,000 researchers.
<p>The present-day French university traces its history to the earlier German language <em>Universit&#x00e4;t Stra&#x00df;burg</em>, which was founded in 1631, and was divided in the 1970s into three separate institutions: <a>Louis Pasteur University</a>, <a>Marc Bloch University</a>, and <a>Robert Schuman University</a>.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university emerged from a <a>Lutheran</a> <a>humanist</a> German <a>Gymnasium</a>, founded in 1538 by <a>Johannes Sturm</a> in the <a>Free Imperial City</a> of Strassburg.
It was transformed to a university in 1621 and elevated to the ranks of a royal university in 1631.
<p>The German university still persisted even after the annexation of the City by <a>King Louis XIV</a> in 1681, but mainly turned into a French university during the <a>French Revolution</a>.
<p>The university was refounded as the German <em>Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universit&#x00e4;t</em> in 1872, after the <a>Franco-Prussian war</a> and the return of <a>Alsace-Lorraine</a> to Germany provoked a westwards exodus of Francophone teachers.
In 1918 Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, so a reverse exodus of Germanophone teachers took place.</p>
<p>During <a>World War II</a>, when France was occupied, personnel and equipment of the University of Strasbourg was transferred to <a>Clermont-Ferrand</a>.
In its place, the short-lived German <a>Reichsuniversit&#x00e4;t Stra&#x00df;burg</a> was created.</p>
<p>In <a>1970</a>, the university was subdivided into three separate institutions:</p>
<li><a>Louis Pasteur University</a> (Strasbourg I)</li>
<li><a>Marc Bloch University</a> (Strasbourg II)</li>
<li><a>Robert Schuman University</a> (Strasbourg III)</li>
<p>These were however reunited in <a>2009</a>, a process that should finish in <a>2012</a>, and were able to be among the first twenty French universities to gain greater autonomy.</p>
<p>The university campus covers a vast part near the center of the city, located between the &quot;Cit&#x00e9; Administrative&quot;, &quot;Esplanade&quot; and &quot;Gallia&quot; bus-tram stations.</p>
<p>Modern architectural buildings include: Escarpe, the Doctoral College of Strasbourg, Atrium, Pangloss and others.
