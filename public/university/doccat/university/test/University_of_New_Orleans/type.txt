In 1966, the graduate division became the Graduate School.</p>
By this time it had developed into a large academic complex embracing multiple colleges, schools, and institutes, offering graduate work in many different fields and awarding both masters and the Ph.D. degrees.
It is also the location for a planned Teleplex Building that will house both of New Orleans&#x2019; public television stations, a public radio station, and video broadcast training space for UNO students.
Registered organizations are separated into categories of either religious, honorary, political, professional, social, service, organizations, or special interests.</p>
