Participants include university students and community members both young and old.
The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats.
<p>The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University.
Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class.
<a>Buckminster Fuller</a>, then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of &quot;doing the most with the least,&quot; and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes.
Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 20 years later, it is still happening.
