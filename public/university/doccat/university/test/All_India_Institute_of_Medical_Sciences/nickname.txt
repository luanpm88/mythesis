<p>The teaching exercises include lectures, seminars, demonstrations and postings in operation theatres, mobile eye camps and various investigative labs.
<p>This course is of 3 years duration.
<p>As per the AIIMS Citizen's Charter, doctors &amp; staff at AIIMS strive to provide comprehensive, high quality tertiary care services including specialty and super-specialty services to all without consideration of caste, creed, religion, sex, economic status or disability.
However, there may be some deficiencies due to extreme patient load and finite resources.
This is in contrast to the situation with most other medical colleges, where women are represented in larger numbers.
As calculated above, the acceptance rate for the MBBS course at AIIMS works out to be about 0.08%.
Hence the graduates of AIIMS have the eligibility to compete only in national level entrance exams and the All India pre-PG test.
The fallout of this verdict is that more AIIMS graduates than before are migrating to the US for their higher education.</p>
The doctors decided to go on strike following the controversial sacking of P. Venugopal, the former director of AIIMS.
On 25 July, the government offered to withdraw its order sacking Venugopal but would raise charges against him before a single-bench court.
