It was established as an institute of national importance by an act of the Indian parliament with the objective of developing a strong curriculum and teaching guidelines for undergraduate and post-graduate education in all branches of medicine in India.
AIIMS seeks to achieve a high standard of medical education in India and to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order so as to attain self-sufficiency in good quality post-graduate medical education.
Because of low cost facilities and highly efficient practitioners AIIMS has been for many years registering patients far above its capacity.
For this prime reason, in 2004, the then prime minister of India; Mr. Atal Bihari Bajpayee announced the establishment of six new AIIMS to be built at Jodhpur, Rishikesh, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Raipur and Patna.

It is adjacent to the South Extension-II market, and lies on the south-eastern quadrant of Aurbindo Marg and Inner Ring Road crossing.
Across AIIMS is <a>Safdarjung Hospital</a> and associated <a>Vardhman Mahavir Medical College</a> (of <a>Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University</a>).
Also, adjacently lies the headquarters of <a>Indian Council of Medical Research</a> (<a>ICMR</a>), the body that coordinates and funds medical research in India.
In vicinity, also lies <a>National Medical Library</a>, run by the Directorate-General of Health Services (DGHS) of the Government of India.
It has a vast collection of scientific and medical journals that can be accessed by researchers.
Farthest along the stretch is the NAMS house, the official building of the <a>National Academy of Medical Sciences</a>, which is a prestigious body of eminent doctors from across India.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>upright|thumb|The Foundation Stone at AIIMS commemorates the gift from New Zealand</a> <a>upright|thumb|Foundation stone at the Academic Building of AIIMS, placed by Queen Elizabeth II</a> AIIMS was inaugurated in 1956, and was built with a grant from the <a>Government of New Zealand</a>.
AIIMS was established in New Delhi after former Indian Prime Minister <a>Jawaharlal Nehru</a>'s intitial proposal to set up the institute in Calcutta was turned down by the then Chief Minister of West Bengal Dr <a>Bidhan Chandra Roy</a>.
It was the vision of <a>Rajkumari Amrit Kaur</a>, the first Health Minister of India, to establish an institute of such nature in India.
<p>AIIMS has been consistently ranked the top medical college in India to pursue an MBBS degree by <a>India Today</a> in annual surveys starting in 1997.
<p>AIIMS' excellence has to do with several factors - small class size, excellent library facilities, liberal clinically oriented teaching, research exposure and the ability to set its own curriculum.
<p>The hospital has been able to maintain high standards of quality while seeing large numbers of patients (3.5 million in 2006) at very low cost to patients (10 Indian Rupees for outpatient doctor consultation equivalent to approx US $0.25), many of whom live in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>However, AIIMS is plagued by bureaucracy, corruption, and emigration of talent pool and it has begun losing its sheen to several private medical centres and hospitals mushrooming across <a>Delhi</a>.
<li><a>B.Sc.</a> (Hons.) in <a>Optometry</a>/<a>Radio-diagnosis</a> (Annual intake of 14 and 9 students in each discipline respectively)</li>
<li><a>B.Sc.</a> (Hons.) in <a>Nursing</a> (Annual intake of 70 students in BSc Nursing)</li>
<li><a>M.Sc.</a> in <a>Anatomy</a>, <a>Biochemistry</a>, <a>Biophysics</a>, <a>Pharmacology</a> and <a>Physiology</a></li>
<li><a>M.Sc.</a> in Urology Technology, Perfusion Technology &amp; <a>Nuclear Medicine</a></li>
<p>Every year AIIMS accepts 72 Indian students, of which 37 belong to General Category and 16 belong to the reserved category (SC/ST), 19 Seats for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 3% orthopedic physically handicapped, based on the results of an all-India entrance examination for its undergraduate M.B.B.S program.The number of students who take the entrance exam every year varies from 80,000 to 100,000.
<p>Five international students (nominated by Government of India from SAARC nations) complete the class size of 77.
AIIMS also specializes in paramedical and basic science training for its undergraduates.
<p>This course is of 3+1 years duration, and is aimed at enabling the students to achieve general understanding of <a>Human Biology</a> and in-depth knowledge of <a>medical science</a> related to basic <a>Ophthalmology</a>, viz., Ocular Anatomy, Ocular Physiology, Ocular Biochemistry, Ocular Pathology, Ocular Microbiology and Ocular Pharmacology, as well as clinical <a>Ophthalmology</a>, viz., <a>Physiological Optics</a>, <a>Orthoptics</a>, Investigative Ophthalmology, <a>Low Vision Aids</a>, <a>Contact Lenses</a>.
<li>To enable candidates to work in hospitals, clinics and community, in order to help in the execution of integrated approach of promotive, preventive, diagnostic, curative and rehabilitative aspects of ophthalmic care,</li>
<li>To carry out refraction of normal as well as <a>low vision</a> patients and prescribe glasses of appropriate power and other parameters (coatings, tints, <a>refractive index</a>, <a>asphericity</a>, design, etc.),</li>
<li>To be able to assess disorders of ocular motility and monocular and binocular visual functions, give orthoptic and pleoptic exercises.
<li>To provide basic knowledge of <a>Human Anatomy</a> and <a>Physiology</a> for understanding <a>Human Biology</a>,</li>
<li>To provide basic understanding of the beneficial and harmful effects of <a>X-ray</a> radiation and protective measures while working with it,</li>
<p>AIIMS was originally built as a Superspeciality tertiary care (refers to India's three-tier health system with Primary clinics, which refer cases to secondary district level hospitals, which in turn refer cases to regional tertiary hospitals) centre with primary emphasis on research and specialized training facilities.
This is followed by specialization, which is the term for postgrad training in General Surgery, General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics and other fields.
Having clinical superspecialities in the same campus as its major research facilities makes AIIMS optimally suited for nurturing best quality translational research, which can translate into clinically useful end products, in India.
Acquiring newer equipment for investigation, research and patient care is expedited as it is not constrained by funds.</p>
<p>There is a separate cardiothoracic and neurosciences centre (CNC) offering superspeciality level patient care, training and research in the respective fields.
It specializes in medical, radiation and surgical oncology.</em></p>
<p>MBBS life in AIIMS has a distinctive laid-back character.
<p>The limitation of class size to just 50 per year ensures a close-knit student community of just over 250 people.
<p>AIIMS has a cosmopolitan student body, owing to its location in the national capital, as well as its countrywide reputation.
<p>Students of AIIMS involve themselves in extra-academic movements, including <a>Pulse</a>, the annual, inter-college festival hosted by AIIMS.
Prayatna is a student organization that arranges <a>blood donation</a> camps for the fulfillment of perpetual shortage of blood at the AIIMS blood bank.</p>

<h3>Controversy regarding its Director</h3>
<p>The Director of AIIMS has been sacked in 2006, after a certain amount of controversy which also included filing a case before the Delhi High Court.This happened as a result of a resolution which was passed by the 17 member governing body of the institute.
Many people have touted this to be an extension of the Ramadoss (The Union Health Minister &amp; The President of AIIMS) and P Venugopal rivalry.
On 8 May 2008,Venugopal was re-instated as AIIMS director by a Supreme Court judgement.</p>
<p>Prior to Supreme court judgment of 25 August 2001 and changes in institutional quota, AIIMS was criticised for the way 33% of Post Graduation Seats were reserved for those who complete their MBBS in AIIMS.
There is now a curtain on the controversy for the present, since the Supreme Court judgment has in effect clearly defined the administrative intricacies and application of rules.</p>
<p>The honourable <a>Supreme Court of India</a>, stated that reserving 33 per cent seats for institutional candidates was in effect 100 per cent reservation for subjects, which was declared ultra vires the Constitution, and, hence, was struck down.
The quota has been quashed by the Supreme Court as per its Judgment in the year 2001.
Once students join AIIMS, they lose their domicile rights to write the post-graduate entrances to other state-level PG entrance tests (as most states require people to do MBBS from the same state to be eligible to apply).
The result is that the AIIMS graduate is, in fact, left with fewer opportunities for competing for a PG seat.
<p> AIIMS students joined in the nation-wide protests which took place in May, 2006.
During the strike all the medical services were shut but parallel OPDs were started after the strike had been carried out for a long time.
The strike continued till 31 May when the doctors called off their strike after the <a>Supreme Court of India</a> orders.</p>
<p>There is also a minuscule section of AIIMS students and doctors under the banner Progressive Medicos and scientists Forum (PMSF) who have traditionally taken a pro-reservation stance on the basis of social justice.
Eventually the Supreme Court found sanctity in the voice raised by RDA-AIIMS and the NGO YouthForEquality  [<a>http://www.youthforequality.com</a>]
The hon'ble SC stayed the OBC reservation bill on ground of being politically mooted and its judgment is awaited.</p>
<p>AIIMS doctors again went on a flash strike in June&#x2013;July 2006 over the issue of increasing political interference in the institution by the Union Health Minister <a>Anbumani Ramadoss</a>.
Venugopal challenged his sacking in the court of law, and the strike ended following the Delhi High Court's decision staying Venugopal's sacking on 7 July 2006.
However, Ramadoss filed an appeal in the <a>Supreme Court of India</a> against the stay on the removal of AIIMS Director on the same day.
Apart from being one of the longest-serving doctors at the institute, he is also credited with being the first Indian to perform a heart transplant.</li>
