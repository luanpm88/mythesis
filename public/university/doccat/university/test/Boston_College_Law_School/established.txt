<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although provisions for a law school were included in the original charter for Boston College, ratified by the General Court of the <a>Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> in 1863, Boston College Law School was formally organized in the 1920s and opened its doors on September 26, 1929.
It was accredited by the <a>American Bar Association</a> in 1932 and the <a>Association of American Law Schools</a> in 1937.
Originally located in the <a>Lawyer's Building</a> opposite the <a>Massachusetts State House</a> in central <a>Boston</a>, it moved to the main Boston College campus in 1954 and to its present  campus, the home of the former <a>Newton College of the Sacred Heart</a>, in 1975.</p>
<p>Due to Boston College student placement in the top law firms in the country, the 2010 <a>Princeton Review</a> rankings place Boston College in the number 7 position for &quot;Best Career Prospects.&quot;
<p>The U.S. News and World Report 2011 Law School Rankings placed Boston College Law School 28th in the country.
In addition, BC Law's legal writing program ranks 9th in the nation and its tax program 23rd.</p>
<p>Regarding recruiting at the top law firms in the country, the <a>National Law Journal</a> ranked BC Law in the top 15 law schools because of the large number of graduates the school places in the top American law firms.
Harvard was the only other Boston school that placed in the top 20 for recruiting.
Past speakers have included supreme court justices, federal appellate court judges and famous scholars of law.</p>
