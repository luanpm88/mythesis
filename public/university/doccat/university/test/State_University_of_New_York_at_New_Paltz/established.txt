It was founded in 1828 as the School for teaching of classics.
In 1885, the New Paltz Normal and Training School was established as a school to prepare teachers for the public schools of New York State.
In the 1980s, it was called <strong>State University of New York College of Arts and Science New Paltz</strong>.
<h2>History</h2>
Today it houses the School of Education.</a>
In 1885, the academy offered their building if the State of New York would start a <a>normal school</a>.
It was granted the ability to award <a>baccalaureate</a> degrees in 1942, when it was renamed the State Teachers College at New Paltz.
A few years later, in 1947, a <a>graduate program</a> was established.
When the <a>State University of New York</a> was established by legislative act in 1948, the Teachers College at New Paltz was one of 30 colleges associated under SUNY's umbrella.
The school is well-known for many programs, including The Legislative Gazette, a journalism and political science internship in which students live/work in the state capitol and produce a weekly newspaper about state politics.
The program launched in 1978&#x2014;and was almost kicked out of Albany&#x2014;but somehow survived and grew into an influential newspaper read by nearly everyone involved in New York state government.</p>
In the spring of 1967, a sit in protesting against army recruiting on campus blocked the entrance to the Student Union for two days.
While there were scores of demonstrators the first day, all but 13 dispersed before State Troopers arrived and bodily carried the demonstrators to a waiting school bus for a trip to court.
<p>In the Fall of 1968, students rallied in support of Craig Pastor (now Craig DeYong) who had been arrested by New Paltz Village Police for desecration of the American flag which he was wearing as a super-hero cape in a student film directed by <a>Edward Falco</a>.
Pastor was released and charges were dropped.
In the spring of 1970 there was a protest leading to the takeover of the Administration Building.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1991, the campus was the scene of a widely-reported <a>PCB</a> and <a>dioxin</a> incident that contaminated four dormitories (Bliss, Gage, Capen and Scudder residence halls), as well as the Coykendall Science Building and the <a>Parker Theatre</a>.
Under the direction of the county and state health departments, the university began a massive, thorough clean-up effort in the five buildings: Bliss, Gage and Scudder residence halls, <a>Parker Theatre</a> and Coykendall Science Building.
Concerns about this incident have been covered in <a>New York Times</a> articles by <a>Michael Winerip</a>, as well as investigative reporting in <a>Woodstock Times</a> and <a>Sierra magazine</a> by <a>Eric Francis</a>.</p>
The first, a <a>feminist</a> conference on sex and sexuality sponsored by the <a>women's studies</a> department entitled &quot;Revolting Behavior: The Challenges of Women's Sexual Freedom&quot;, featured instructional workshops on <a>sex toys</a> and <a>sadomasochism</a>.
The second, &quot;Subject to Desire: Refiguring the Body&quot;, was sponsored by the Fine and Performing Arts Department.
One presenter, <a>performance art</a>ist <a>Carolee Schneemann</a>, had been known for a piece where she slowly unrolled a scroll from her <a>vagina</a> and read it to the audience.</p>
The controversy escalated when the Theatre Arts Department staged <em><a>The Vagina Monologues</a></em> shortly afterwards.
The college's then-president, Roger Bowen, defended <a>freedom of expression</a> on campus and refused to apologize, doing little to allay conservative ire.
<p>In 2006, New Paltz became embroiled in a controversy involving three <a>Student Government</a> officers, who were suspended from the University for a year after an altercation with the Residence Life Director, although a video showed some claims may have been erroneous.</p>
<p>Federal Judge <a>Lawrence Kahn</a> ordered Poskanzer and Rooney to reinstate Holmes and Partington on January 4, 2007, but in February, 2008, Judge Kahn concluded dismissed their due process and retaliation claims.</p>
<p>Out of all the schools in the State University of New York system, New Paltz is one of the most selective, recently accepting 34% of all applicants.</p>
