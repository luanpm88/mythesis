<p>The <strong>University of Fribourg</strong> (; ) is a <a>university</a> in the city of <a>Fribourg</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>.</p>
<p>The roots of the University can be traced back to 1582, when the notable Jesuit <a>Peter Canisius</a> founded the <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Saint-Michel</a> in the City of <a>Fribourg</a>.
In 1763, an Academy of law was founded by the state of Frobourg which formed the nucleus of the present Law Faculty.
The University of Fribourg was finally created in 1889 by an Act of the parliament of the Swiss <a>Canton of Fribourg</a>.
<p>Located directly at the language border between the French and German speaking parts of Switzerland, the University of Fribourg is Switzerland&#x2019;s only bilingual university and offers full curricula in those two Swiss national languages.
Traditionally, the university also attracts a strong contingent of students from Italian-speaking part of Switzerland as well as many students from abroad.
The Misericorde Campus, constructed between 1939&#x2013;42, was designed by the architects Honegger and Dumas, students of the famous Swiss architect Le Corbusier and as such is deemed to be of major architectural importance.
A second Campus for the sciences departments and laboratories was gradually developed in the &#x201c;P&#x00e9;rolles&#x201d; part of Fribourg during the 20th century.
To accommodate a doubling of student numbers since 1980, the new, additional Campus complex &#x201c;P&#x00e9;rolles 2&#x201d;, designed by B&#x00fc;ro B Architects, was inaugurated in 2005.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|University of Fribourg, main building.</a></p>
<p>The University owes its origin to the foundation of the Jesuit <a>College St. Michel</a> on Belze Hill by <a>St.
Pierre Canisius</a> in 1580 at the invitation of the government of Fribourg.
The question of Catholic higher education came to the fore with the development of the Protestant academies at Geneva, Lausanne and Basle.
In 1763, an Academy of Law was founded, housed in the Albertinium(now a Dominican residence).
In 1834, the cantonal library was formed from works brought to Fribourg (from Catholic monasteries) for safekeeping.
The College St. Michel was closed following the expulsion of the <a>Jesuits</a> from Fribourg after the canton's defeat in the Sonderbund war.</p>
He raised funds through a lottery and was granted some 2,500,000 CHF by the canton.
One of the conditions was that he should delay the construction of the university buildings and lectures took place in the buildings of St. Michel.
The cantonal library became integrated with that of the university and the Academy became the Faculty of Law.
<a>Benito Mussolini</a> worked as a stone mason on the Biblioth&#x00e8;que Cantonale et universitaire (BCU) centrale, the central library of the university.
The Dominicans managed the theological faculty, due to an agreement with the canton of Fribourg.
The buildings of St. Michel eventually became too crowded and in 1939 the university moved to a new campus constructed on the former cemetery of Misericorde, ceding St. Michel to one of Fribourg's gymnasia, which took the name College St. Michel.
During the Second World War, the University set up &quot;university camps&quot; along with the University of Z&#x00fc;rich to educate Polish prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The Perolles campus was constructed on the site of a former wagon factory.</p>
<p>Although many lectures were originally in Latin, Fribourg is now the only French/German bilingual university in the world (40% French and 60% German).The town itself is 70% French and 30% German.
This fact, coupled with the traditional dominance of French as the language of the city aristocracy explains why French has remained so dominant in university administration and in the AGEF (Association Generale des Etudiants Fribourgois), the Student's Union.
To commemorate the centerary of the University La Poste issued a stamp depicting the figures Science and Sagesse.</p>
<p>In 2005, the University inaugrated its Perolles 2 campus, to which the Faculty of Economics and Social Science relocated.
The University has the third largest collection of Biblical antiquities in the world after the British Museum and the Cairo Museum.
Fribourg has also developed FriMat, a centre of excellence in nanotechnology.
The <a>academic degrees</a> were the Demi-Licence, Licence, <a>DEA</a> / DESS, <a>Doctorate</a>.
The University now follows the requirements of the <a>Bologna process</a>.
The University of Fribourg recently launched for the 2009-2010 academic year a new Postgraduate law programme, the &quot;<a>Master of Laws in Cross-Cultural Business Practice</a>&quot; (MLCBP), an <a>LL.M</a> taught entirely in English.</p>
Festivities begin with Mass in the Chapel of the Coll&#x00e8;ge St. Michel.
The members of the University then proceed to the Aula Magna (Great Hall) in solemn procession.
The student guilds attend in ceremonial dress including swords.</li>
One of them is still engaged in dueling, while the other guilds in Fribourg already rejected this tradition at the time they were founded, amongst others for religious reasons.
<li>The Day of Welcomes (Jour D'Accueil) - Similar to Fresher's Week in Anglophonic Universities.
A minority of students live in foyers often run by religious organisations (though the University aids with some of the construction costs), but most rent places of their own, a common practice in Switzerland.
<p>Primary degrees used to last for five or five and a half years, culminating in a Lizenziat (equivalent to a Master's degree), although with the introduction of the Bologna reforms, the University awards a BA after three years and an MA after a further two years.
<p>The University Seal depicts a Cross and Bishop's ring representing the University's Catholic ethos on a shield of black and white, representing the canton of Fribourg.
The logo of the Universit&#x00e9; is a blue stylized &quot;F&quot; (with triangles echoing the facade structure of the Mis&#x00e9;ricorde Building and simbolizing the Alps) and the name of the University in Latin.</p>
