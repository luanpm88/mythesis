<li>Student Guilds - These are similar to the student guilds in Germany and Austria, but there is no de facto constraint to participate as it is in the <a>student nations</a> at the universities of <a>Uppsala</a>, <a>Lund</a> and <a>Helsinki</a>.
Membership has often been considered advantageous for those wishing to pursue a career in business, politics or law.
New students are invited to the Aula Magna, where they are welcomed to Fribourg by the Rector and the Syndic (Mayor of the City of Fribourg).
<p>The main sports at the University are skiing, fencing, ice hockey, football, and basketball.
