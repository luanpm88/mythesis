<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded by Virginia <a>Baptists</a> in 1830 as a <a>seminary</a> for men, with instruction begun by the Rev. Edward Baptist, the school was incorporated ten years later as <strong>Richmond College</strong>.
During the <a>American Civil War</a>, Richmond College was used as a hospital for <a>Confederate</a> troops and later as a <a>Union</a> <a>barracks</a>.
By the end of the war, the college was bankrupt and unable to continue functioning.
He is most remembered for his decision to move the college in 1914 from its original location in what is now the <a>Fan district</a> to its current location in the <a>Westhampton</a> area of Richmond.
The university's main library, Boatwright Memorial Library, is named in Boatwright's honor.</p>

In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, followed by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962.
In 1969, E. Claiborne Robins, a <a>trustee</a> and <a>alumnus</a>, donated $50 million to the university, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time.
The school, which opened in 1992, was the first of its kind in the U.S.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1992, candidates <a>George H. W. Bush</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, and <a>Ross Perot</a> came to campus for the first-ever &quot;town hall&quot; televised presidential debate, viewed by 200 million people worldwide.</p>
<p><a>Edward L. Ayers</a>, former dean of the <a>College of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, is the current president of the University of Richmond.
Dr. Ayers was named the ninth president of the University of Richmond on November 10, 2006.

<p> Chartered in 1840, Richmond College was only 30 years old when it added a Law Department.
The initial years were very successful for the new Law Department but during the difficult financial times that followed the Civil War, legal education was intermittent at Richmond College until 1890.
In that year, the family of the late T.C. Williams, Sr., endowed a Professorship of Law, thus assuring the continuous teaching of law at Richmond College.
The Law School was granted membership in the Association of American Law Schools in 1930 and now enrolls approximately 500 full-time students and has 4,300 active alumni.</p>
A variety of evening programs with credit and non-credit courses make it possible for those with busy schedules to further their education or explore new interests.</p>

These requirements include the Core Course, a two-semester course heavily focused on international writings and philosophy that first-year students must complete.

<p> The University of Richmond's campus consists of  in a suburban setting on the western edge of the city.
The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus &mdash; red brick buildings in a <a>collegiate gothic</a> style set around shared open lawns.
Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a> in 1910.
<a>Warren H. Manning</a>, a former apprentice to <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, designed the original landscape plan.
The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil.
In 2000, the campus was recognized by <a>The Princeton Review</a> as the most beautiful in the United States.</p>

Much of the movie <em><a>Cry_Wolf</a></em> was filmed on the Westhampton side of campus, with several dormitories, including South Court, North Court, and Keller Hall, serving as locations.
Several episodes of the television show <em><a>Dawson's Creek</a></em> were also filmed on campus, referring to Richmond only as a nameless &quot;beautiful Ivy League campus.&quot;
The filming itself took place in Stern Quad and inside the Jepson Alumni Center.</p>
<p>The University of Richmond also owns the former <a>Reynolds Metals Executive Office Building</a>, purchased from <a>Alcoa</a> in 2001.
Located a few miles from campus, the  building was designed by architect <a>Gordon Bunshaft</a> and opened in 1958.
The building, which incorporates nearly 1.4 million pounds of <a>aluminum</a>, is listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
It currently serves as the headquarters of <a>Altria Group</a> and its subsidiary, <a>Philip Morris USA</a>, which are leasing it from the university.
In early 2001, the university also finalized the purchase of  of land in eastern <a>Goochland County</a>, a few miles from the main campus.
