The campus is situated around an area to the southwest of downtown Arlington, and is located roughly in the middle of <a>Dallas&#x2013;Fort Worth metropolitan area</a>.
The university was founded in 1895 and was primarily a <a>military academy</a> during the early 1900s.
After spending several decades in the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>, the university joined <a>The University of Texas System</a> in 1965.
A 1963 reorganization of the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a> focused on the <a>College Station</a> campus, even though the enrollment at Arlington State College exceeded enrollment at the College Station campus at the time.
The decision by the Texas A&amp;M University governing board to focus on the College Station campus led officials of Arlington State College and a number of Arlington citizens to enlist the support of Governor <a>John Connally</a> and key members of the Texas Legislature to separate Arlington State College from the Texas A&amp;M University System and to join <a>The University of Texas System</a>.
On April 23, 1965, Arlington State College officially became a part of The University of Texas System.
Its name changed in 1967 to The University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
Enrollment in the fall of 1998 was 18,662 students.
Natural gas drilling on the campus began in 2008.

The women's basketball team played in the 2005 and 2007 NCAA tournaments; the men's basketball team made its first appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing in the first round against #1 seed <a>Memphis</a>, who was later forced to vacate this and all other wins from the 2007-2008 season.</p>

In 2005, the University administration proposed a new <a>Special Events Center</a>, including a state of the art arena better designed for basketball and volleyball as well as other university activities.
This proposal has been approved, and ground was broken on the Special Events Center on March 5, 2010.
<p>UT Arlington fielded a <a>football</a> program, playing out of <a>Maverick Stadium</a>, until 1985 when it disbanded football after the season.
The school administration blamed its decision on major losses, nearly $1 million a year, as well as low average attendance (5,600, the student body at the time was 23,100).
In April 2004, UT Arlington students voted by a 2-to-1 margin to increase their student athletic fees by $2 per semester-credit hour should the university reinstate football and begin women's golf and women's soccer teams; however, after review, President James D. Spaniolo dismissed the idea as too costly in terms of time and resources.</p>
