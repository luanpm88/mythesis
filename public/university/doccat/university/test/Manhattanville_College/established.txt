<p>The architectural and administrative centerpiece of the Manhattanville campus, Reid Hall (1864) is named after Whitelaw Reid, owner of the New York Tribune.
On either side of Reid Hall stand academic buildings on one side and on the other residence halls around a central Quad designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the designer of Central Park.
The Manhattanville community regards the central Quad and buildings as representing the academic vision of the College&#x2019;s commitment to integrated learning and centered strengths.
Other historic buildings include Lady Chapel, the President&#x2019;s Cottage known as the Barbara Debs House, the old Stables, and Water Tower.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1837 the Academy of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic boarding school for girls, was founded in a three-story house on <a>Houston Street</a> on <a>Manhattan</a>'s <a>Lower East Side</a>.
The Academy relocated in 1841 to an area in the northwestern part of Manhattan Island on a hill overlooking the village of <a>Manhattanville</a>.
Destroyed by a fire in 1888, the Academy was rebuilt on the same foundation and continued to grow both in curriculum and physical size.
In March 1919, 76 years after its founding as an academy, Manhattanville was chartered as a college by the New York State Board of Regents, empowering it to grant both undergraduate and graduate degrees.
During the Depression and World War II, President Grace Cowardin Dammann, <a>RSCJ</a>, instilled in Manhattanville's students a keen awareness of social problems by encouraging them to spend one day a week working with children at the Barat Settlement in the Bowery and at Casita Maria in East Harlem.
This speech and Mother Dammann&#x2019;s commitment to racial integration were frequently applauded by other leaders, including Sargent Shriver who in a speech he gave at a Baptist Church in Winnetka, Illinois, praised Mother Dammann for her visionary leadership.
<p>In 1952 under president Mother Eleanor O'Byrne, the college moved from its campus in Harlem [<a>http://www.citycollegefund.org/c1955.htm</a>] to suburban <a>Purchase</a> to the former estate of <a>Whitelaw Reid</a>, &quot;Ophir Hall.&quot;
After becoming co-ed and secular in the late 1960s and early 70's the college faced a crisis of identity and some of its real-estate assets were liquidated.
Under the leadership of presidents Barbara Knowles Debs, Marcia Savage, and Richard Berman, Manhattanville underwent a strengthening of assets.
Co-educational since 1969 and non-denominational in its governance since 1971, Manhattanville's original vision lives on in the tradition of service begun by the <a>Society of the Sacred Heart</a>, extending from the students to the global community through Manhattanville's mission to educate ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community.
RSCJs continue to serve on the College&#x2019;s Board and a few reside on campus.
In 2010, as part of Inauguration ceremonies for President Smith, the College hosted an evening of Gregorian Chants, in honor of its Pius X School of Liturgical Music, which closed in 1969.</p>

The college originally purchased a larger tract of land, but sold segments to the <a>Keio Academy</a> and <a>Mastercard</a> in the 70's and 80's.
The centerpiece of the campus is a quadrangle designed in part by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, who was hired by Reid to landscape his estate.
The quad is bordered on its north end by <a>Reid Hall</a>, which occupies the footprint of Ben Holladay's Ophir Hall, which burnt down and was rebuilt by Whitelaw Reid as a massive granite <a>crenellated</a> mansion, built in 1895 to designs by <a>McKim, Mead &amp; White</a> and now known simply as &quot;the Castle.&quot;
Reid Hall was at one time a potential site for the United Nations, and its grounds were listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1974.
On the northwest side of the quad is the Manhattanville library, with a full-time cafe.
There is also a graveyard on campus which contains the remains of nearly 50 nuns, a relic of the days of when it was a Catholic school known as Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart.
The historic Lady Chapel, with an unused crypt in its basement, and biology classroom in the Ohnell Environmental Park were designed by <a>Maya Lin</a>, who designed the <a>Vietnam War Memorial</a>.
Stones from the dismantled Japan Pavilion at the New York World Fair, a gift from the Japanese government to the College, can be found around the President&#x2019;s Cottage.</p>

<p>The Pius X School of Liturgical Music was opened in 1916 as part of the College.
It was founded by Justine Ward, who had developed teaching methods for Gregorian chant emulating the techniques of the monks in <a>Solesmes</a>, and by Mother Georgia Stevens, RSCJ, a musician and <a>Roman Catholic</a> nun.
Faculty over the years included Ward, <a>Achille Bragers</a> and <a>Andre Mocquereau</a>.
The school's namesake was <a>Pope Pius X</a>, a devotee of sacred music who initiated reform of the <a>liturgy</a> in the 20th century.
The institute closed in 1969.
In 2010, a Gregorian Chant, held in Pius X Hall, as part of Inauguration festivities for the current President, saw a packed auditorium of alumni, students, and faculty.
A renewed focus on history at the College by President Smith has resulted in the revival of several signature traditions and a renewed focus on the community&#x2019;s shared commitment to ceremonial events, historic commemorations, and rich history of accomplishments in the field of music.

<p><strong>The Touchstone</strong> is the oldest newspaper serving the Manhattanville community.
<p>Manhattanville is a member of NCAA Division III, competing primarily in the <a>Freedom Conference</a> within the <a>Middle Atlantic Corporation</a> as well as in the ECAC West Conference (men's hockey) and ECAC East Conference (women's hockey).
<p>The origin of the unique nickname is traced back to the winter of 1974 and Tim Cohane, Sr., the sports editor of Look Magazine for more than 20 years and the father of then men&#x2019;s basketball coach Tim Cohane.
When thinking of a school nickname for the former all-girl's school, Cohane, Sr. came up with a 16th century quote from Jeanne d&#x2019;Albret, the mother of Henry of Navarre (Henry IV): &#x201c;A vaillant coeur, rien impossible,&#x201d; translated into English as &#x201c;To the valiant of heart, nothing is impossible.&#x201d;
Attempting to capitalize on that inspiration, the Manhattanville programs adopted the distinctive slogan and have been known as the Valiants ever since.</p>
The men's team has made four NCAA Tournament appearances, including a Frozen Four berth in 2007, and has spent 103 of the last 115 weeks in the Top 15 of the USCHO.com
The Valiants first were ranked #1 in Division III on Jan. 17, 2005 and spent 11 straight weeks (Dec.
III Player of the Year Andrew Gallant.</p>
III National poll on November 23, 2009, becoming the fifth Valiant program overall to earn a national ranking and the first non-hockey team at the school since the field hockey team was nationally ranked for five weeks in 2004.</p>
