<p>BUAA was founded on October 25, 1952 with an area of over 100 hectares, BUAA is one of China's leading universities on research and education.
It is regarded as one of the best engineering universities in China and has a great influence on China's <a>aeronautical</a> and <a>astronautical</a> industry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>BUAA was formed in 1952 from a merger of the aeronautical departments of <a>Tsinghua University</a>, <a>Peiyang University</a>, <a>Xiamen University</a>, <a>Sichuan University</a>, <a>Yunnan University</a>, <a>Northwestern Engineering College</a>, <a>North China University</a>, and <a>Southwest Aeronautical Institute</a>.
<p>The meeting announcing the founding of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics (BIA) was held in the auditorium of Beijing Institute of Technology on October 25, 1952.
In the early days of the university, most of the faculty and students lived on campuses of <a>Tsinghua University</a> and <a>Beijing Institute of Technology</a> before they moved on to their own new campus, which was chosen in May, 1953 and located at the BaiYanZhuang Village, <a>Haidian District</a>, in the western suburb of Beijing.
Construction of campus buildings started on June 1, 1953.
More than 60,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of buildings were completed within 6 months.
By October, 1953, all students and some of the faculty moved to the new campus and started their daily work and study.
Initially, there were two departments with 4 majors: Aeroplane Design and Aeroplane Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engineering, and Engine Design, Engine Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engine Engineering.
<p>BUAA was among China's first 16 key universities back in the 1950s, and among the top 15 for priority development during China's <a>7th Five-Year Plan</a> period (1986&#x2013;1990).
During the <a>8th Five-Year plan</a> it was listed among the top 14 for priority development, and at the start of the <a>9th Five-Year Plan</a> BUAA was among the first batch of 15 universities in &#x201c;<a>project 211 for Higher Education</a>.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Since 1952, this university was named the &quot;Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics&quot;.
Since May 1988, it has been known as the &quot;Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics&quot;.
In 2002, the university board decided to change the English name of the university to <strong>Beihang University</strong> and keep the abbreviation <strong>BUAA</strong>.</p>
The university library, with an area of over 24,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has a collection of over 1.2 million.</p>
<p>October 25 is the anniversary and the following weekend is homecoming weekend.</p>
<p>As one of the top-ranked research university, BUAA has had more than 40 projects that were ranked first in China, since it was established in 1952.
Nowadays, it has evolved into a university of engineering science and technology with an emphasis on aeronautical and astronautical engineering, covering such diverse fields as science, technology, liberal arts, law, economics, management, philosophy, foreign languages and education.
It has established cooperation with 152 universities and research institutions from 40 countries, including the Canada, UK, France, Germany, Russia, United States, and 122 scholars have been invited as honorary professors to Beihang University.
Every year, on average, about 1000 foreign experts and scholars come to BUAA to give lectures, to visit, and to take part in international conferences, and discussions for scientific cooperation; and every year over 600 BUAA faculties go abroad to give lectures, participate in academic conferences or conduct cooperative scientific research.</p>
<p>Since its founding BUAA has been one of the key universities given priority for development.
In the new century and millennium, BUAA was officially listed in China's Action Plan for the Revitalization of Education in the 21st Century.
Over the past 50 years BUAA has provided about 80000 professionals of high caliber in various disciplines for China.
The library, with an area of over 24,000 m2, has a collection of over 1.2 million books.
BUAA has become one of the China's important bases for scientific and technological innovation and quality education of high-level personnel.</p>
Of several prestigious defense-related institutes administered by the <a>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>, BUAA has better opportunities.</p>
But for such a young engineering university, it's endeavoring to make improvements to produce leaders of its fields for the community.</p>
<p>In BUAA, undergraduate education is focused on training creative specialized graduates with solid basic knowledge and can also study and work independently in the science field with necessary skills.
Centering on this aim, BUAA has a <a>credit</a>-based education plan, which is flexible for students to plan their college life.
With the distinct feature of diverse talents cultivating plan, students can gradually concrete an individualized cultivating mode on top of the perfection of the former general education.
BUAA is now trying to establish a leading system of undergraduate education as a research-oriented university.</p>
On the training of graduate students, BUAA keeps reforming deeply, developing positively, guiding diversely, enhancing construction, stressing innovation, improving the quality of teaching, emphasizing creativity, constructing a proper environment for the cultivation of specialized personnel and creating highly qualified graduates.</p>
As it entered the new century and millennium, the university was again listed in China' s Action Plan for the Revitalization of Education in the 21st Century.
Thanks to the tireless efforts of several generations of people BUAA has grown into an open, multi-disciplined, research-oriented university of engineering science and technology with an emphasis on aeronautical and astronautical engineering.
BUAA, as a center of both higher education and scientific research, has become one of the important bases for quality personnel education and scientific research in China.</p>
&quot;Yangtze River Scholar Award Program&quot; is a trans-century creative talent program funded by <a>Ministry of Education</a> and Hongkong <a>Li Ka-Shing</a> Foundation in 1998.
Since its foundation, the university has had more than 40 projects that were ranked first in the country and has received more than 900 awards for achievements, which have made BUAA one of the top-ranked universities in the field of high tech.
In addition, BUAA has filled scientific and technological gaps nationwide by making and launching spacecrafts of different models, such as, &#x201c;Beijing -1&#x201d; , the first <a>light aircraft</a> in China; &#x201c;Beijing -2&#x201d; , the first <a>sounding rocket</a> in <a>Asia</a>; &#x201c;Beijing -5&#x201d; , the first <a>unmanned aircraft</a> in China; &#x201c;BEE&#x201d; series; <a>coaxial rotors</a> <a>helicopter</a>.
BUAA has also invented a flight simulator in automation, a <a>silicon compiler</a> in computer science, a <a>Phase Change Disk</a> in material and information storage, a robot of multi-degree freedom in <a>artificial intelligence</a> and assisted in the successful launch of the <a>Shenzhou spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>The university has worked hard to gain partners in research through technological development, transfer of research findings, manufacture of products and education of personnel.
It has also spared no effort to promote collaboration in production, learning and scientific research, and to expand the application of its scientific research by strengthening the cooperation between the government and university, undertaking large-scale construction programs, and building joint R&amp;D centers and laboratories with enterprises.
Students often publish papers and file patent applications during the training program.</p>
It is like <a>Senior Project</a> in the <a>United States</a>.
All first prize winners can continue their graduate studies exempt from <a>entrance examination</a> in BUAA.</p>
In some serious engineering departments like the School of Jet Propulsion, School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Astronautics, female students are so rare that the ratio of male to female students in an undergraduate class can be as low as 7:1.</p>
