<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early twentieth century as a <a>women's college</a>.
The Young Women's Industrial Club, formed in 1903 by <a>Lucy Ann Skidmore</a> (1853&#x2013;1931) with inheritance money from her husband who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821&#x2013;1882), a former coal merchant.
In 1911, the club was chartered under the name &quot;Skidmore School of Arts&quot; as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women.</p>
<p><a>Charles Henry Keyes</a> became the first president of the school in 1912, and in 1919 Skidmore conferred its first baccalaureate degrees under the authority of the State University of New York.
By 1922 the school had been chartered independently as a four-year, degree-granting college.</p>
<p>Skidmore College was first located in downtown <a>Saratoga Springs</a>, but on October 28, 1961, the college began to move to the Jonsson Campus,  of land on the outer edges of Saratoga Springs.
The Jonsson Campus was named for the Skidmore trustee <a>Erik Jonsson</a>, the founder and president of <a>Texas Instruments</a> and a former mayor of <a>Dallas, Texas</a> (1964&#x2013;71).</p>
<p>Trustee Josephine Young Case delivered a challenge on the development of the new campus, a speech which to this day guides Skidmore's development.
For example, on Scribner Library she wrote, &quot;And at the heart of the beating center, you must set the library where every book wanted is immediately at hand, and a thousand others wait beside them to be discovered.&quot;</p>
For the first time, the college began admitting men to its regular undergraduate program (a few dozen male <a>World War II</a> veterans had been admitted in 1946 - 49).
Skidmore also launched an innovative program called the &quot;University Without Walls&quot; (UWW), which allows nonresident students over the age of 25 to earn bachelors degrees.
Skidmore began granting masters degrees in 1991 through its Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) program.
The Skidmore Honors Forum was founded in 1998.</p>
<p>2006 marked the start of the largest campaign in Skidmore's history, named: <em>Creative Thought.
The goal is to raise $200 million, and as of November 15, 2009 $194 million had been raised.</p>

<p>Most of the buildings on Skidmore's  campus were constructed after 1960.
Consequently, the grounds have a contemporary ambience that is enhanced by the numerous sculptures and murals that decorate the quads and other common areas.</p>

--&gt; The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery is the college's most prominent arts facility.
The Saisselin Art Building houses studios for animation, ceramics, communication design, drawing, fibers, metals, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture.
Skidmore has a well-known music program and is currently building a large concert hall with state-of-the art facilities to replace its current music building.</p>
Harder Hall houses math and computer science; geology, chemistry, physics, and biology operate out of Dana Science Center.
The average class size is 16 (generally smaller in lab courses) and the typical student-to-teacher ratio is 11:1.</p>
--&gt; The Lucy Scribner Library, which houses approximately half a million volumes, is notable for both its function and beauty.
A substantial collection of rare books is kept in the third floor Pohndorff Room.
The third floor is home to a children's library which is used by Saratoga residents.
A helpful service offered by the library is the inter-library loan; students can put in a request for a book found at another college and have it sent to Skidmore free of charge.</p>
The exception to this is Wiecking Hall which is Skidmore's only corridor-style building.
<p>Much of Skidmore's property is taken up by North Woods, a  forest that adjoins the academic campus and reaches up to the bottom of the Adirondack mountains.

--&gt; &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|The Malloy Wing.</a> --&gt; The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery was opened in 2000, and was designed by the  architect <a>Antoine Predock</a>.
The Tang is nationally known for both its architecture and its holdings, and its excellence has been recognized by the <em><a>New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>Art in America</a></em>, and <em><a>Architectural Digest</a></em>, among other publications.</p>
<p>The Tang has a private collection of over 5,000 works, including pieces by <a>Rembrandt van Rijn</a>, <a>Albrecht D&#x00fc;rer</a>, <a>Francisco de Goya</a>, <a>William Hogarth</a>, <a>Roy Lichtenstein</a>, <a>Andy Warhol</a>, <a>Garry Winogrand</a>, <a>W.
The museum also maintains extensive collections of art from Africa, South Asia, China, and the Americas.</p>
Artists who have shown at the Tang include <a>Kara Walker</a>, Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, <a>Trisha Brown</a>, and Richard Pettibone.
Skidmore classes regularly meet in the galleries and classrooms, and groups from other schools visit to view exhibits, hear lectures, watch powerpoint presentations, and participate in workshops.
<p>Because of a record-breaking donation made by the estate of Arthur Zankel, Skidmore received $46 million, a portion of which was used as a lead gift to make the state of the art Arthur Zankel Music Center.[<a>http://cms.skidmore.edu/zankel/arthurzankel.cfm</a>] Designed by Ewing Cole, the building has won awards even before it was built.
<p>Janet Kinghorn Bernhard '26, while a senior at Skidmore, became the first editor of the Skidmore News.
In the 1960s, she and her husband, Arnold, (a Skidmore trustee) committed themselves to building a theater on the new campus.
They were both present in 1987 to see their long-awaited dream come true, at the dedication of the Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater.
The main theater is also the home of the annual National College Comedy Festival.[<a>http://www.skidmore.edu/map/bernhard.htm</a>] the Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater was named the  #17 Best College Theater by princeton review.</p>
<p>A new dining hall was opened in Fall 2006 with futuristic architecture and a new kitchen which has greatly improved food quality.
The new dining hall offers a variety of food selections including 7 food sections; The Global Caf&#x00e9; (foods from around the world), Semolina (pasta), Emily's Garden (salad bar and Vegan options),  The Diner (more typical college foods), The Corner Deli (custom made sandwiches and wraps), Dessert, and Supremo's (pizza).
The Pizza section has a brand new wood burning oven that is warm and earthy, contrasting with the rest of the dining hall's modern design.
The expansion of the campus will provide Skidmore with the growth needed to continue as a top academic institution in the years to come.</p>
In addition to being the official liaison between students and the administration, the Skidmore SGA advocates for college policies that benefit the short- and long-term interests of the student body.
