image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Ottoman Empire</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Considered as the world's second institution of higher learning specifically dedicated to engineering education, Istanbul Technical University (ITU) has a long and distinguished history which began in 1773.
established$$$@@@%%%ITU was founded by Sultan <a>Mustafa III</a> as the <a>&quot;Imperial Naval Engineers' School&quot;</a> () (), and it was originally dedicated to the training of ship builders and cartographers.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1795 the scope of the school was broadened to train technical military staff for the modernization of the <a>Ottoman</a> army.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1845 the engineering function of the school was further widened with the addition of a program devoted to the training of architects.
established$$$@@@%%%The scope and name of the school were extended and changed again in 1883 and in 1909 the school became a public engineering school which was aimed at training civil <a>engineers</a> who could provide the infrastructure for the rapidly developing country.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Modern Turkey</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By 1928 the institution had gained formal recognition as a university of engineering which provided education in both engineering and architecture.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1944 the name of the institution was changed to Istanbul Technical University and in 1946 the institution became an autonomous university with <a>architecture</a>, civil, mechanical, and electrical <a>engineering</a> faculties.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|250px|Ma&#x00e7;ka Campus in the district of Sisli</a> With its long history of 234 years, its modern teaching environment, and well-qualified teaching staff, Istanbul Technical University today is the personification of the <a>engineering</a> and architectural education in Turkey.
established$$$@@@%%%Istanbul Technical University not only played a leading role in the modernization movement of the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, but has also maintained its leadership position in the changes and innovations taking place in the construction, industrialization, and technological realms during the modern days of the Turkish Republic.
established$$$@@@%%%Engineers and architects trained at Istanbul Technical University have played significant roles in the construction of Turkey's <a>highways</a>, <a>bridge</a>s, <a>dams</a>, <a>factories</a>, buildings, energy production plants, communication networks, and in the development of its villages, towns, and cities.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Alumni also played a significant role in Turkish politics.
