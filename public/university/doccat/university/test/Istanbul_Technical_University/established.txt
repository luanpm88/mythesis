It is the world's third oldest  <a>technical university</a> dedicated to engineering sciences as well as social sciences recently, and is one of the most prominent educational institutions in Turkey.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Considered as the world's second institution of higher learning specifically dedicated to engineering education, Istanbul Technical University (ITU) has a long and distinguished history which began in 1773.
ITU was founded by Sultan <a>Mustafa III</a> as the <a>&quot;Imperial Naval Engineers' School&quot;</a> () (), and it was originally dedicated to the training of ship builders and cartographers.
In 1795 the scope of the school was broadened to train technical military staff for the modernization of the <a>Ottoman</a> army.
In 1845 the engineering function of the school was further widened with the addition of a program devoted to the training of architects.
The scope and name of the school were extended and changed again in 1883 and in 1909 the school became a public engineering school which was aimed at training civil <a>engineers</a> who could provide the infrastructure for the rapidly developing country.</p>
<p>By 1928 the institution had gained formal recognition as a university of engineering which provided education in both engineering and architecture.
In 1944 the name of the institution was changed to Istanbul Technical University and in 1946 the institution became an autonomous university with <a>architecture</a>, civil, mechanical, and electrical <a>engineering</a> faculties.
<a>thumb|250px|Ma&#x00e7;ka Campus in the district of Sisli</a> With its long history of 234 years, its modern teaching environment, and well-qualified teaching staff, Istanbul Technical University today is the personification of the <a>engineering</a> and architectural education in Turkey.
Istanbul Technical University not only played a leading role in the modernization movement of the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, but has also maintained its leadership position in the changes and innovations taking place in the construction, industrialization, and technological realms during the modern days of the Turkish Republic.
Engineers and architects trained at Istanbul Technical University have played significant roles in the construction of Turkey's <a>highways</a>, <a>bridge</a>s, <a>dams</a>, <a>factories</a>, buildings, energy production plants, communication networks, and in the development of its villages, towns, and cities.
Since its establishment in 1773, Istanbul Technical University has managed to keep itself up-to-date by following the technological developments which have occurred worldwide.
The university offers its students an educational environment which is rooted in tradition and yet open to the very latest in modern education techniques and settings.

<p>And also <a>Dual Diplom Programs between ITU and State University of New York &amp; Montana State University</a>.</p>
Also ITU's faculty of architecture is accredited by <a>NAAB</a> and faculty of maritime is accredited by IMO.
<p>Another suburban campus of ITU is the Tuzla Campus.
It is located in the Tuzla district of <a>Istanbul</a>, which is a dockyard area.</p>
It was a <a>military barracks</a> in the <a>Ottoman</a> era.
<li><a>Mustafa Inan Library</a> has approximately 533,000 books, 500,000 volumes of book periodicals and 6000 rare Ottoman/Latin books.
It is Turkey&#x2019;s contemporary and technically richest library.
ITU Mustafa Inan Library is the central library of the six libraries and coordination center of the library services of the <a>Technical University</a>.
ITU Library Services' history goes back to 1795, the printing house of the M&#x00fc;hendishane-i Berri-i H&#x00fc;mayun of Ottoman Empire.</li>
<p>ITU's <a>nuclear reactor</a> of Triga Mark-2 is in the Maslak campus.
<p>Since the foundation in 2003 <a>Ar&#x0131; Technopolis</a>, where is located at the Ayaza&#x011f;a Campus, provides companies with researching, technology development and production opportunities at the university, in cooperation with the researchers and academicians.
The super computer of this center was one of the world's top 500 list super computers (240th).</p>
<p>Having a suburban campus like Maslak has created the opportunity of building many sports areas.
Ayaza&#x011f;a Gymnasium also has a stadium with a seating capacity of 3500 for basketball and volleyball matches.
Also ITU has an option for those who like to organise events and socialise with people from various European countries in the Local <a>Board of European Students of Technology</a> Group which had 40 members in 2007.
Despite all these, it can still be a little quiet in the campus from time to time because students can choose the city of <a>Istanbul</a> over the campus life.</p>
<p>ITU has a capacity of 3000 studeng housings:Lakeside Housings, IMKB Dormitory, Verda Urundul, Ayazaga Dormitory and Gumussuyu dormitory.
