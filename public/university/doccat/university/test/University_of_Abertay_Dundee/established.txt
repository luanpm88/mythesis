<p>The <strong>University of Abertay Dundee</strong>, usually known simply as <strong>Abertay University</strong>, is a <a>Modern University</a> in <a>Dundee</a>, Scotland.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>The University of Abertay Dundee</a> was created in 1994, under government legislation granting the title University to the <strong>Dundee Institute of Technology</strong>.
This organisation - focussed on broadening educational access to the working classes of Dundee - was founded in 1888 as Dundee College of Technology.
It was recognised as an &quot;industrial university&quot; by the <a>Scottish Office</a> as early as 1902 and gained independent degree-giving authority in the 1970s.</p>
The University prepares graduates with real skills for employment, and has moved beyond offering traditional academic subjects.
As the first University in the world to offer a &quot;computer games&quot; degree, The University of Abertay is at the forefront of providing talented technical graduates with advanced skills in digital design, computer programming, maths and physics - all of which are crucial to effective games creation.
Teams of students from around the world each summer compete to create a new game in just ten weeks.
<p>Particularly exciting areas of research currently under way at Abertay include using soil science to understand the threats of climate change, combining environmental management and 3D modelling to plan sustainable cities, solving crimes by finding fingerprints on fabrics, and training police firearms officers using digital simulations of crime situations.</p>
These range from games programming at the science and technology end, to narrative-based animation at the arts end.</p>
<h3>School of Computing and Engineering Systems</h3>
The university's Rankin House - a fully furnished flat for recreating crime scenes - was named after and opened by internationally renowned crime writer Ian Rankin.</p>
<p>As well as being Tayside's leading provider of business and management education, the <a>Dundee Business School</a> offers students many opportunities, both inside and outside the classroom, to explore the challenges of business in the 21st century.</p>
