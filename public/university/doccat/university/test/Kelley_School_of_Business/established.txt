<h2>History</h2>
<p>The School was established as &quot;School of Commerce and Finance&quot; of Indiana University in 1920.
It was subsequently renamed &quot;School of Business Administration&quot; in 1933 and &quot;School of Business&quot; in 1938.
In 1997 it was named &quot;Kelley School of Business&quot; after its alumnus, <a>E.W. Kelley</a>, Chairman of The <a>Steak n Shake</a> Company, gave a substantial donation of $23 million.</p>
<p>Initially it resided in the Commerce Building constructed in 1923 (William A. Rawles Hall since 1971), moving to the Business and Economics Building in 1940 (called Woodburn Hall since 1971) and finally to today's Business School building in 1966.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2005 interim Dean Dan Smith was <a>appointed</a> to be the new dean of the school, replacing Dean Dan Dalton who stepped down in 2004.</p>
<p>In a ceremony on October 21, 2005, the Kelley School renamed its Graduate and Executive Education Center in honor of William J. Godfrey, an alumnus and successful businessman who has bequeathed land valued at $25 million.
It is the single largest gift in the Kelley School's history.
