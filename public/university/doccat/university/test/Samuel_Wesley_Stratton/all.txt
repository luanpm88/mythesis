nickname$$$@@@%%%The Bureau worked hand in glove with industry to undertake research that the private sector required but could not finance itself.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%In his inaugural address he said: &quot;The terms pure and applied science have not the same distinction as formerly.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The same men, methods and equipment are involved in getting at the facts, whether they are needed in solving problems in industry or in extending our knowledge of principals.
nickname$$$@@@%%%There are few cases of the latter that do not find immediate application.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%Tying education to industry, he said that industry that had once been slow to seize upon scientific advances was now demanding them.
former_names$$$@@@%%%As recounted by <em>Time</em> magazine, &quot;he demonstrated the economic wisdom of generous support for research in pure science.
established$$$@@@%%%He said that the automotive industry must find a substitute for gasoline, on which the elder Edison commented that the electric storage battery has already filled the bill.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Edison looks for all transportation and industry to be electrified.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1927, he served as one of three members as an Advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor <a>Alvan T. Fuller</a>, along with President <a>Abbott Lawrence Lowell</a> of Harvard and Probate Judge <a>Robert Grant</a>.
