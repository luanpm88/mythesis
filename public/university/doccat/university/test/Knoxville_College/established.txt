<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1862, the Reverend O.S. McKee, under the auspices of the Freedmen's Mission of the <a>United Presbyterian Church</a>, founded the <a>McKee School</a> in <a>Nashville</a>, the first organized school for Negroes in Tennessee.
The church soon established similar <a>missionary schools</a> for <a>blacks</a> in <a>Mississippi</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, <a>Alabama</a>, and <a>Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1872, the <a>General Assembly</a> of the church resolved to discontinue support of the schools in order to establish a college where blacks might prepare for ministerial and teaching careers.
Two years later, the church selected Knoxville to be the site of the college as the black residents of the city expressed interest in education and the city was strategically located between existent centers of black education, Nashville and <a>Atlanta</a>.</p>
<p>In 1875, Knoxville College began operation in a former freedmen's elementary school.
The following year, the college moved to a permanent location on a hill northwest of and overlooking downtown Knoxville.
<p>During the 1880s, black legislators obtained state scholarships for military cadets at the college.
During 1890&#x2013;1909, the college served as the Industrial Department for black students of the <a>University of Tennessee</a> in order to acquire funds for the scientific and industrial education of blacks, authorized by the <a>Second Morrill Act</a>.</p>
From 1920 to 1950, the <a>normal school</a> was emphasized giving to the school the distinction of being the leading supplier of teachers to black schools in <a>East Tennessee</a>.
Since 1950, the College of Arts and Sciences has been emphasized including the implementation of community service programs and dramatic productions.</p>
<p>In 1954, the college charter was amended in order to allow formally the admission of white students, although the children of some white faculty members had previously attended the college.
In 1957, the college was one of the first group of predominantly black institutions admitted to full membership in the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS).
In 1979, the church deeded the title for the college property to the <a>Board of Trustees</a> of the college.</p>
<p>In 1997, the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> withdrew Knoxville College's <a>accreditation</a>.
Judson served as president of Plattsburgh State University of New York from 1994 to 2003 and as president of Grambling State University, a historically black college in Louisiana, from 2004 until fall 2009.</p>
<p>The July 6, 2006 edition of <em><a>The Tennessean</a></em> newspaper, based in <a>Nashville, Tennessee</a>, reported a reversal of fortune.
The article outlined that a year earlier, the college was down to about 130 students, couldn't pay its faculty or electric bills and was drowning in debt.
However, according to the report, enrollment was rebounding with more than 400 students accepted for the 2006 Fall semester from more than 700 applicants.
The faculty was being paid, the lights are back on, and the college's debts had been cut by about two-thirds, down more than $2 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, let me tell you it's the best problem in the world&quot;, Will Minter, an <a>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> official helping as a development strategist and fundraiser for the college, said of enrollment growth.
&quot;We've had outstanding success in getting assistance from a number of people to get us to this point.
<p>The Knoxville College Alumni Association, according to the article, was reportedly in the middle of a $1 million fundraising effort, while the college was engaged in a $2.5 million &quot;Road to Success&quot; campaign.
Administrators said the college had paid down $2 million in debt, but still was $1 million behind.
As a result of the fire two rooms were destroyed with smoke damage throughout the building.
Knoxville Fire Department investigators determined that the fire was accidental and was not due to an electrical problem.</p>
<p> The campus of Knoxville College is located on , situated north of downtown Knoxville, in the city's Mechanicsville community.
Its 17-building campus continues to be the primary institution for minority students in <a>East Tennessee</a>.
<p>In 1989, the school acquired the two-year <a>Morristown College</a> in <a>Morristown, Tennessee</a>, which became Knoxville College-Morristown.
The two-year school closed in 1994.</p>
<p>Knoxville College in partnership with the <a>Pilot Gas</a> station located adjacent to the campus (at the corner of Western Avenue and Middlebrook Pike), is revitalizing the Knoxville College Historic District.</p>
