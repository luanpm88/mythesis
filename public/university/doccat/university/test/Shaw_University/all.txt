mascot$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding to the 1960s</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Shaw University was founded by the <a>American Baptist Home Mission Society</a> of the Baptist Church.
established$$$@@@%%%Shaw was the first college established for <a>African Americans</a> in the <a>Southern United States</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Later Tupper and his Bible study students constructed a two-story church, with one story being dedicated to the church, and the other to what is known as the Raleigh Institute, where he taught freedmen.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1915, still supported by the American Baptist Home Mission, the school had an enrollment of 291 students, about evenly divided between men and women.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was renamed Shaw Collegiate Institute after Elijah Shaw, benefactor of Shaw Hall, the first building constructed for the college.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1875, it became Shaw University.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1873, <a>Estey Hall</a> was erected for female students, making it the first such dormitory in the U.S. on a coeducational campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The <a>Leonard Medical School</a> was founded in 1881 as the first four-year medical school in the South to train black doctors and pharmacists.
established$$$@@@%%%It was also the first medical school in North Carolina to offer a four-year curriculum and operated until 1918.
established$$$@@@%%%Given their importance in the education of African Americans, both Estey Hall and Leonard Hall have been listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>

chancellor$$$@@@%%%Martin Tupper]], first president of Shaw University]]</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Education was seen by freedmen as among their most critical needs.
established$$$@@@%%%In many 19th century communities, the roles of minister and teacher were closely allied, and Shaw's teaching had a strong spiritual base.
established$$$@@@%%%Shaw University trained many of the new teachers who taught African Americans in the South after the Civil War.
established$$$@@@%%%They worked for a profound cause, the advancement of their race.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Northern white teachers also came to the area to teach.
established$$$@@@%%%Newly free adults and children eagerly sought to learn to read and write.
established$$$@@@%%%Most southern states imposed <a>segregated</a> schools by the late 1870s.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>African-American teachers nurtured their students and were part of their communities, acting as role models to encourage children to seek an education.
country$$$@@@%%%By 1900, more than 30,000 black teachers had been trained and put to work in the Southern United States, and the majority of African Americans had become literate.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Shaw University has been called the mother of African-American colleges in North Carolina, as <a>North Carolina Central University</a>, <a>Elizabeth City State University</a>, and <a>Fayetteville State University</a> all had founding presidents who were Shaw alumni.

city$$$@@@%%%<h3>1980s to present</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By the mid-1980s, Shaw University's student body had declined and the university was deeply in debt.
established$$$@@@%%%With the presidency of Dr. Talbert O. Shaw (1988-2003) (not related to the namesake), Shaw University was revived and the student body grew markedly, from 1,600 to 2,700.
