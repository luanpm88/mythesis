<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shaw University was founded by the <a>American Baptist Home Mission Society</a> of the Baptist Church.
Shaw was the first college established for <a>African Americans</a> in the <a>Southern United States</a>.
Later Tupper and his Bible study students constructed a two-story church, with one story being dedicated to the church, and the other to what is known as the Raleigh Institute, where he taught freedmen.
By 1915, still supported by the American Baptist Home Mission, the school had an enrollment of 291 students, about evenly divided between men and women.
<p>It was renamed Shaw Collegiate Institute after Elijah Shaw, benefactor of Shaw Hall, the first building constructed for the college.
In 1873, <a>Estey Hall</a> was erected for female students, making it the first such dormitory in the U.S. on a coeducational campus.
The <a>Leonard Medical School</a> was founded in 1881 as the first four-year medical school in the South to train black doctors and pharmacists.
It was also the first medical school in North Carolina to offer a four-year curriculum and operated until 1918.
Given their importance in the education of African Americans, both Estey Hall and Leonard Hall have been listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
In many 19th century communities, the roles of minister and teacher were closely allied, and Shaw's teaching had a strong spiritual base.
Shaw University trained many of the new teachers who taught African Americans in the South after the Civil War.
They worked for a profound cause, the advancement of their race.
Newly free adults and children eagerly sought to learn to read and write.
Most southern states imposed <a>segregated</a> schools by the late 1870s.</p>
<p>African-American teachers nurtured their students and were part of their communities, acting as role models to encourage children to seek an education.
<p>Shaw University has been called the mother of African-American colleges in North Carolina, as <a>North Carolina Central University</a>, <a>Elizabeth City State University</a>, and <a>Fayetteville State University</a> all had founding presidents who were Shaw alumni.
The founder of <a>Livingstone College</a> spent his first two college years at Shaw before transferring to <a>Lincoln University</a>.
What became <a>North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University</a> was located on Shaw's campus during its first year.</p>

The <a>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC) began at a conference held at Shaw University and led by <a>Ella Baker</a> in 1960.
SNCC played a strong role in <a>Freedom Summer</a> and the voter registration drives in Mississippi during 1964 and 1965.
<p>By the mid-1980s, Shaw University's student body had declined and the university was deeply in debt.
With the presidency of Dr. Talbert O. Shaw (1988-2003) (not related to the namesake), Shaw University was revived and the student body grew markedly, from 1,600 to 2,700.
The university also succeeded in raising its standards.
He joined civic groups to highlight the status of the university.
His efforts helped to create opportunities for students to take advantage of the university's unique location.
He worked to redefine the advantages a small liberal arts university could offer African-American students and to create new strengths in the departments.
<a>Raleigh City Council</a> recently approved the university's request to buy four lots on the northwest corner of Person and Lenoir Streets, formerly known as the Shaw Villa.
Office space has been increased with the completion of renovations in Estey Hall.
The university now owns the historic <a>Rogers-Bagley-Daniels-Pegues House</a> and the adjacent <a>Frazier House</a>.</p>
The university grew into a thirty-three building campus in the heart of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina (not including the ten satellite campuses).
A dual-degree programs in Engineering, Pharmocology, and Dentistry with <a>North Carolina State University</a> and <a>North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University</a> was created in 2007.
The university also approved the creation of the pre-med program, which was accredited by the <a>American Medical Association</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, SUDS received a 10-year accreditation from the Association for Theological Schools.
In that same year, Shaw University partnered with the State of North Carolina and <a>Johns Hopkins University</a> for an institute for research on the impact of current health legislation on the elderly.
In 2006, the university partnered with the City of Raleigh to create a Citizens' Participation and Leadership Institute, to encourage civic engagement and cultivate leadership throughout the city.</p>
<p>Another example of new directions is that the university is collaborating with the <a>University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill</a> on a Partnership for the Elimination of Health Disparities Center.
As noted by Dr. Daniel Howard, center co-director at Shaw University, establishing the research resources at Shaw, meant that &quot;more African American college students can become health researchers, which is a definite plus when trying to eliminate disparities.&quot;
<p>Shaw University is also a member of the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges (CRC) Program.
<p>Shaw University led a research study to investigate why no black veterans of WWII had been awarded the <a>Medal of Honor</a>.
The study concluded that racial discrimination had contributed to the military's overlooking the contributions of black soldiers.
<p>In January 1995, the team&#x2019;s findings were sent to the <a>U.S.
Department of Defense</a>.
In April 1996, the department agreed that seven of the ten soldiers should be awarded the Medal of Honor.
President <a>Bill Clinton</a> awarded the Medals of Honor on January 13, 1997.
Those who were awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously were: <a>1st Lt. Charles L. Thomas</a> of <a>Detroit, Michigan</a>; <a>Pvt.
George Watson</a> of <a>Birmingham, Alabama</a>; <a>Staff Sgt.
Ruben Rivers</a> of <a>Tecumseh, Oklahoma</a>.</p>
The University also has jazz, pep, and concert bands as well as the COGs (Children of God) which represents a wide range of student activities that exist at Shaw University.
The university's radio station, 88.9 FM or WSHA, is one of the popular jazz stations in the triangle.
These pre-professional organizations provide ways to enhance classroom activities while enjoying the camaraderie of fellow students.</p>
<p>Shaw's marching band better known as the &quot;platinum sound&quot; was reestablished in the Fall of 2002 along with the reestablishment of the football team.
Shaw's marching band has participated in the Honda Battle of the Bands at the <a>Georgia Dome</a> in <a>Atlanta, Georgia</a>.
<p>Shaw University consists of 32 buildings and nine additional campuses across the state of <a>North Carolina</a>.
The Campus has a memorial garden in the heart of the campus which is also the location of the tombs of the founder of Shaw University, <a>Dr.
Henry Martin Tupper</a> and his wife Sarah and the University Belltower, that was erected in honor of those who came and left the institution, from its founding to its present.
The Campus has Three Libraries, The James E. Cheek Library, The TOS Education Library, and the Divinity School Library, that houses over 25000 volumes, 10,000 ebooks, and many other sources of scholarly and cultural literature as well as microforms, located throughout Shaw University(including cape sites).
The Campus has four dorms, the Flemming-Kee Men's Dorm, the Dimple Newsome Dorm, Talbert O. Shaw Men's Dorm and the Talbert O. Shaw Women's Dorm.
