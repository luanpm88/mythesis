<p> <img>  <a>thumb|right|HKIEd Campus View</a> The <strong>Hong Kong Institute of Education</strong> (Abbreviated: HKIEd, ) is one of the eight subsidised tertiary institutes under the <a>University Grants Committee of Hong Kong</a> and is the only one dedicated to teacher education.</p>
<p>The history of Hong Kong Institute of Education can be traced back to 1853.
St. Paul&#x2019;s College introduced the first formalised program of in-service teacher training.
This was described in its Annual Report for 1994/95.
On 25 April 1994, under the recommendation made by the Education Commission Report No 5, it was formally established by the merger of:</p>
<li>The Northcote College of Education (&#x7f85;&#x5bcc;&#x570b;&#x6559;&#x80b2;&#x5b78;&#x9662;)</li>
<li>The Grantham College of Education (&#x845b;&#x91cf;&#x6d2a;&#x6559;&#x80b2;&#x5b78;&#x9662;)</li>
<li>The Sir Robert Black College of Education (&#x67cf;&#x7acb;&#x57fa;&#x6559;&#x80b2;&#x5b78;&#x9662;)</li>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Established in 1994 upon the foundation of 70 years of teacher training by the former Colleges of Education, the Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) is the only <a>University Grants Committee</a> funded institution dedicated professional teacher education in Hong Kong.
<p>In October 1997, the institute moved to its new campus in <a>Tai Po</a> near the <a>Tai Po Industrial Estate</a>.
<p>In 2001, the HKIEd HSBC Early Childhood Learning Centre was established on the campus.
The HKIEd Jockey Club Primary School was founded on the campus in the following year.</p>
<p>With effect from 1 May 2004, the government granted the institute <a>self-accrediting</a> status in respect of its own teacher education programs at degree-level and above.</p>
Most of its first batch of students, which graduated in 2005, already had job offers earlier than other BEd graduates at HKIEd or other universities.</p>
<p>In January 2010, the University Grants Committee endorsed the HKIEd's plans for Research Postgraduate programmes and undergraduate programs in three disciplines: &quot;Humanities&quot; (mainly Language), &quot;Social Sciences&quot;, and &quot;Creative Arts &amp; Culture&quot;.</p>
<p>The approval is seen as a step closer for the institute to gaining its university title by becoming a fully-fledged university of education with a range of disciplines and strong research capacity.</p>
<p>HKIEd will launch its first batch of non-education programs, namely the Bachelor of Arts in Language Studies and Bachelor of Social Sciences in Global and Environmental Studies in September 2010.
<h2>History of each college</h2>
<h3>The Northcote College of Education</h3>
<p>The Northcote College of Education was established in 1939.</p>
<h3>The Grantham College of Education</h3>
<p>The Grantham College of Education was established in 1951.</li>
<p>In January 2007, a public row broke out between the management and the government over the future of the institute.
Battle lines were drawn between the Vice-Chancellor <a>Paul Morris</a> and former <a>Secretary for Education and Manpower</a>, <a>Prof.
The dispute had apparently been brewing for some time, as far back as June 2002, when the new Education Secretary Arthur Li was appointed.
Apparently, Li favored a merger of the institute with another higher education institution, namely the <a>Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> (CUHK).
Morris maintained he had been warned by the Chairman of the Council, Dr. Thomas Leung Kwok-fai, as far back as June 2006, that his tenure would end unless he agreed to the amalgamation of the institute with the CUHK.</pre>
<li>19 July 2002 - Morris was allegedly told by Simon Ip Sik-on, a former chairman of the institute's council, during a lunch he shared with Li and two other senior institute officials that Li threatened to render the institute unviable if a merger could not be achieved.</pre>
<li>25 January 2007 - The governing council of the institute decided in a vote of 10 to 3, with three abstentions, not to renew Vice Chancellor Morris' contract.
Leung denied Morris' assertion about the threats to the security of his tenure, instead accusing Morris of misinterpreting him.
Leung insisted that there was no connection between the two.
<li>26 January 2007 - Deputy Vice Chancellor Professor <a>Bernard Luk Hung-kay</a> (&#x9678;&#x9d3b;&#x57fa;) alleged on <a>RTHK</a> Radio 1's Openline Openview phone-in program that during the summer of 2003, after results of the <a>Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers</a> were released, the media reported (falsely) that most of 330 teachers who had failed in the test were from the Hong Kong Institute of Education.
<li>5 February 2007 - Luk alleged both in his open letter and on RTHK Radio 1's Openline Openview program that Li had made veiled threats both against him and Morris in the past.
(The quote was said in English).
Luk suggests in his letter that the time is up for his &quot;[[Shylock|pound of flesh]].&quot;
&lt;br&gt;Luk also alleged that during January 2004, Li had phoned Morris to once again urge Morris to take the lead in amalgamating with CUHK.
pointed out that there had been numerous newspaper articles written by IEd staff members in the past few years criticizing the EMB education reform and policies.
Luk maintained this resulted in a number of phone calls from a certain high-ranking official in the EMB, demanding the immediate dismissals of those four staff members, which they refused to entertain.</pre>
<li>6 February 2007 - Staff members Leung Yan-wing (&#x6881;&#x6069;&#x69ae;) and Yip Kin-yuen (&#x8449;&#x5efa;&#x6e90;) asked <a>Legco</a> to investigate further or set up an open hearing into the allegations.
Legco member <a>Cheung Man Kwong</a> told RTHK Radio 1's Openline Openview phone-in program that he along with eight other Democratic camp members had already written to <a>Legco</a>'s Education Committee chairman <a>Tsang Yok-sing</a>, urging him to convene an emergency meeting to investigate these allegations of government interference in the running of IEd.
Students overwhelmingly passed vote of no-confidence in Governing Board Chairman Thomas Leung Kwok-fai: of 680 the voters, only 36 students backed Leung.
<li>7 February 2007 - It was announced that Legco's Education Committee would convene on 12 February 2007 to discuss any further action and that it would invite both IEd representatives and Arthur Li himself if necessary.</li>
<li>9 March 2007 - Pro-government legislators blocked an attempt to set up a Legco inquiry to investigate allegations over meddling with the academic freedom and autonomy of educational institutions.
<li><a>Chief Executive</a> <a>Donald Tsang</a> set up a commission headed by Justice Woo Kwok-hing.</li>
<li>20 June 2007 -  The commission dismissed allegations that Li had interfered with the institutional autonomy, but pinned the blame on Fanny Law.
Law resigned immediately from her post of <a>Commissioner</a> of the <a>Independent Commission Against Corruption</a>.</pre>
