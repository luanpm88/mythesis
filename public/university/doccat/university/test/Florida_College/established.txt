<p> <strong>Florida College</strong> is a small, regionally accredited, coeducational <a>Christian</a> <a>college</a> located in the City of <a>Temple Terrace, Florida</a>, eight miles (13 km) northeast of the City of <a>Tampa</a>, Florida.
<p>Since its founding as a <a>junior college</a> in 1946, Florida College has drawn its staff, faculty, and the majority of its students from <a>non-institutional</a> <a>Churches of Christ</a> (<a>Restoration Movement</a>); it is also recognized among these churches as an important training center for ministers.
The college maintains no official connection with any religious body, however, for doctrinal reasons.
This gives it some unusual characteristics as religious colleges go &#x2013; Florida College accepts no direct contributions from any organized religious body, and the members of its board serve as individuals rather than as official representatives of any religious body.</p>
<p>The high emphasis Florida College places on its Christian heritage is expressed in its tradition of daily chapel services.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The campus is located in the heart of the historic City of <a>Temple Terrace</a> and sits astride the banks of the beautiful <a>Hillsborough River</a> (to the east) and is surrounded by the private golf course land of the <a>Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club</a>, circa 1922.
Two of the oldest buildings in the city are an integral part of the campus fabric and are Sutton Hall, circa 1922, which was originally the clubhouse for the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club, and the Student Center, which was originally the Club Morocco Nightclub and Casino, circa 1926.

Noted Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott was the architect for both buildings which were part of the original Temple Terrace Estates, one of the first Mediterranean Revival golf course planned communities in the United States (1921).
After the Florida economic collapse of 1926, in the late 1930s, the property and its buildings were acquired by the <a>Florida Bible Institute</a> from the City of Temple Terrace before being sold to the founders of today's Florida College.</p>
<p><a>Billy Graham</a> attended Florida Bible Institute, which owned the property now occupied by Florida College, in the late 1930s.
In his autobiography he writes he received his calling &quot;on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club&quot;.
A Billy Graham Memorial Park is on the east side of the 18th green on the river.</p>
<p>Known as Florida Christian College, the school's charter was drafted in 1944.
The school opened in fall 1946 with 100&nbsp;students.
The college charter stipulates the Board of Directors be active in a local, generally <a>non-institutional</a>, Church of Christ.
In 1954 the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted Florida College full <a>accreditation</a> for the Associate of Arts degree.
<p>In the 1960s the school's recruitment policies changed, and students outside the Churches of Christ were pursued.
A vote by the students and staff resulted in dropping the word &quot;Christian&quot; from the school name in 1963.
By the 1970s the bulk of the student body were again members of Churches of Christ, although the students were younger and more traditional than those of the 1950s.

Approximately 90% of students live on campus, in one of 4 residence halls.
<p>Athletic teams participate in <a>basketball</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>soccer</a>,and <a>cross country</a>.
