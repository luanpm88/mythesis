<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1836, Emory &amp; Henry College is named after <a>John Emory</a>, a <a>Methodist</a> <a>bishop</a>, and <a>Patrick Henry</a>, an American <a>Patriot</a> and <a>Virginia</a>&#x2019;s first governor.
The college was founded upon the union of faith and learning and the ideals of freedom and civic virtue by Creed Fulton, a Methodist minister, Colonel William Byars, Tobias Smyth, a Methodist farmer, and Alexander Findlay, a Methodist businessman.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry has been affiliated with The Holston Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church since its inception, and Emory &amp; Henry is still affiliated with the conference to this day.
The foundation for Wiley Hall was laid on 30 September 1836.
The board of trustees then hired Charles Collins (1838-1852) as the institution's first president with classes beginning in the spring of 1838 with only 60 students enrolled.
<p>As the oldest college in <a>Southwest Virginia</a>, Emory &amp; Henry College&#x2019;s entire campus is listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
<p>According to college's web-site, the official mission of the college is stated as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;'Increase in Excellence,' the historic motto of Emory &amp; Henry College, expresses the college&#x2019;s intention to be a learning community that moves toward fulfilling every student's potential.
Bishop John Emory, along with the founders of Methodism, symbolizes the college&#x2019;s belief in the union of faith and learning, while Governor Patrick Henry symbolizes the college&#x2019;s commitment to freedom and civic virtue.</p>
<p>E&amp;H affirms the Christian faith as its spiritual and moral heritage and encourages all of the college&#x2019;s members to grow in faith as they grow in knowledge.
E&amp;H believes in the worth of each person's religious and cultural heritage, inasmuch as that heritage leads to service to others in our region and the larger world.</p>
<p>E&amp;H affirms the liberal arts as its intellectual foundation and believes that excellence results when everyone actively participates in the educational process.
<p>Such traditions provide the context for the college&#x2019;s pursuit of excellence, as it engages a diverse group of well-qualified men and women in educational experiences that lead to lives of service, productive careers, and global citizenship.&quot;</p>
<p>Located in the Virginia Highlands, the Emory &amp; Henry central campus encompasses  and is surrounded by an additional 167 undeveloped acreage in the village of Emory.
The entire central campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Register of Historic Landmarks.</p>
<p>E&amp;H was honored with the Corporation for National and Community Service Presidential Award March 2010, making it the first Virginia institution for higher learning to receive the award.</p>
Emory &amp; Henry was one of five Virginia institutions to make the top 100 and the only regional college or university among the 569 (or the top 15 percent) selected for the ranking out of the 3,798 institutions nationwide.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry is ranked as the 25th safest school in the nation.</p>
<p>It is also featured in Loren Pope's book, <em>Colleges That Change Lives</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Emory &amp; Henry doubles the talents of most of the kids it gets, and contributes to their moral development as well.
I didn't meet anyone who wished he'd gotten into some other school, which is unusual, because at nearly every college, except maybe Harvard, there is a sullen cohort of rejected suitors of another institution.&quot;
<p>In the last 20 years, six E&amp;H professors have been named Virginia or U.S. Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation and the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education&#x2014;a feat unmatched by any college or university in the state.</p>
While it is primarily used today as a <a>trick play</a>, it was revived in 2007 as an integral part of the <a>A-11 offense</a>, a high school football offensive scheme that was eventually banned due to the exploitation of loopholes in the high school rulebooks.
The offense inspired <a>Steve Spurrier</a> to use variations of it as a trickplay formation at Florida and South Carolina named &quot;Emory &amp; Henry&quot;, as Spurrier attended Wasps games as a child growing up in nearby <a>Johnson City, TN</a>.
<p>The Emory and Henry football team has a long storied history claiming 10 ODAC Conference Championships (more than any other member of the ODAC) since the league's inception in 1976,  and appearing in the Tangerine Bowl (currently called the <a>Capital One Bowl</a>) during the 1949 and 1950 seasons.
They have also managed to make it to the 1987 NCAA DIII Semifinal game under coach Lou Wacker before losing to now Division I <a>Wagner College</a>, and well as making it to the DIII tournament numerous times.
and have won games against other Division I programs such as <a>Tennessee</a>, <a>Appalachian State</a>, <a>Marshall</a>, <a>The University of Central Florida</a>, and <a>Middle Tennessee State</a>.
The Wasps oldest current football rival is <a>Hampden-Sydney College</a> who first played the Wasps in 1922.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry College has had three players drafted to the NFL over the years.
The most notable being <a>Sonny Wade</a>(class if '69) who went on to play several years in the CFL.</p>
Union College</a> (Class of 1977), and helped the Purple Raiders win seven DIII National Championships.</p>
While there are many rumored origins of the nickname, the most commonly accepted story is that Emory &amp; Henry was first called the Wasps after the football team played the first ever game in Tennessee's <a>Neyland Stadium</a> by a local Knoxville newspaper.
Though Emory &amp; Henry was beaten 27-0, legend has it that the local paper declared &quot;that those Virginia boys stung like wasps,&quot; and the nickname has stuck ever since.</p>
Pete is a reference to the late Emory &amp; Henry basketball coach Bob Johnson's <a>Labrador retriever</a> (which was also named Pete).
Pete (the dog) was often seen sitting beside Coach Johnson during games at the King Center.</p>

<p>Service Plunge - the college's annual &quot;Service Plunge&quot; is a tradition and a requirement of all incoming freshman in which they must go out and perform community service for a day during the first month of school (usually a Saturday).</p>
The event, although short, is often attended by large portions of the student population due to its somewhat humorous nature.</p>
Coach Self was a long time assistant coach for the Emory &amp; Henry football team who died of cancer and whose saying &quot;Trust in your teammates, trust in yourself&quot; is painted in the football locker room.
This is due to the fact that the pond is naturally heated due to a spring (which can be see in the corner closest to Wiley Hall in the foundations of the old well house).</p>
This is due the fact that lage numbers of Emory &amp; Henry students live on campus and since they do not have to drive to school, the college often feels little need to cancel class.</p>
