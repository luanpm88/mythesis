<p> The <strong>University of Denver</strong> (<strong>DU</strong>), founded in 1864, is the oldest <a>private</a> <a>university</a> in the <a>Rocky Mountain Region</a> of the <a>United States</a>.
The University of Denver is a <a>coeducation</a>al, four-year <a>university</a> in <a>Denver</a>, <a>Colorado</a>.
The  main campus is a designated <a>arboretum</a> and is located primarily in the <a>University Neighborhood</a>,&lt;!--- DU is NOT in University Park.
<p>The university was founded in 1864 as the Colorado Seminary by <a>John Evans</a>, the former <a>Governor</a> of <a>Colorado Territory</a>, who had been appointed by <a>President</a> <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>.
John Evans, who also founded <a>Northwestern University</a> prior to founding DU, is the namesake of the town in <a>Illinois</a> named <a>Evanston</a> (the site of the Northwestern campus) as well as <a>Mount Evans</a>, a 14,264 foot mountain visible from the DU campus.
<a>275px|right|thumb|Mary Reed Hall</a> Evans founded the school to help civilize the newly-created (1858) City of <a>Denver</a>, which was little more than a mining camp at that time.</p>
<p>As a co-educational institution, according to College Board, under a competitive standard, the average admitted applicant is at his or her top 25% of their graduating class.</p>
<p>The reverse initials &quot;DU&quot; are used as the university's shorthand moniker (rather than the more intuitive &quot;UD&quot;) as part of a Rocky Mountain and midwestern tradition of initial reversal, similar to the University of Colorado's &quot;CU&quot;, the University of Tulsa's &quot;TU&quot;, the University of Oklahoma's &quot;OU&quot;, the University of Nebraska's &quot;NU&quot;, and the University of Kansas' &quot;KU.&quot;</p>
<p>The 'Colorado Seminary' was founded as a <a>Methodist</a> institution and struggled in the early years of its existence.
By 1880, the Colorado Seminary had been renamed the University of Denver.
Although doing business as the University of Denver, DU is still legally named Colorado Seminary.
The first buildings of the university were located in downtown <a>Denver</a> in the 1860s and 1870s, but concerns that Denver's rough-and-tumble frontier town atmosphere was not conducive to education prompted a new campus (today's campus) to be built on the donated land of potato farmer Rufus Clark, some seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of the downtown core.
The university grew and prospered alongside the city's growth, appealing primarily to a regional student body prior to <a>World War II</a>.
After the war, the large surge in <a>GI bill</a> students pushed DU's enrollment to over 13,000 students, the largest the university has ever been, and helped to spread the university's reputation to a national audience.</p>
<p>The University of Denver has 11,644 students in 2009.
Around 50 percent of the student body is from outside the state of Colorado.
For 2009 the average accepted high school student obtained a 3.7 GPA, SAT combined of 1220 and, an ACT of 27.</p>
The school is currently ranked the 48th best private university by the same publication.</p>
<p>The undergraduate business program, The <a>Daniels College of Business</a>, was ranked 67th best in 2008 by <a>BusinessWeek</a>, and it was ranked the 71st best program by U.S. News in a 2008 ranking.
It was ranked 74th in 2010 by Bloomberg Businessweek.
The University of Denver's Daniels College of Business also ranked 3rd in the nation for its ethics programs among 111 undergraduate business schools in 2010 according to Bloomberg Businessweek.</p>
<p>The <a>Sturm College of Law</a> is currently ranked the 77th best Graduate Law School by U.S News in a 2010 ranking.</p>
<p>In a 2006/2007 survey performed by the College of William and Mary and published by Foreign Policy magazine, the <a>Josef Korbel School of International Studies</a> ranked 9th in the nation for graduate programs, ahead of such schools as Syracuse, University of Chicago, Yale, Stanford, University of California-Berkeley, and MIT.</p>
<p>In 2006, <em>Men's Fitness</em> magazine ranked DU in the top-25 fittest colleges in America because the University actively promotes a healthy lifestyle for its students.

<p>Aside from the Sturm College of Law, the university operates on a quarter system, sometimes known as trimester academic calendar, in which an academic year is divided into three academic quarters lasting 10 weeks per each quarter.
This academic system allows students to take more classes each year than students in a more traditional 15-week semester system.</p>
<p>Offering students a learning experience abroad, the Cherrington Global Scholars program offers every undergraduate the chance to study abroad at no cost above the normal university tuition, room and board.
<p>The art and music scene of DU is currently on the rise due to the recent construction of the <a>Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts</a>.
This building houses the Lamont School of Music, the DU Theatre Department, and the University's <em>Newman Center Presents</em> performing arts series.
The Lamont School of Music is a structured conservatory setting which allows students to focus on their talents in a competitive manner.
Recently, their show &quot;Henry the VI part iii&quot; was selected as one of the best in the region was considered for national recognition.
<p>With the recent addition of more faculty members and renovation beginning on Margery Reed Hall, the Theatre Department has become a magnet for theatre students in the region.
<p>The university was the first in the country to establish what has continued to be an innovative and internationally recognized Digital Media Studies program, organized as a joint venture between the departments of Mass Communications and Journalism Studies, Art, and Computer Science.

In 2003, the University of Denver <a>ATLA</a> trial team won the national championship in New Orleans, taking <a>Harvard</a>'s title from the previous year.</p>
<a>Richard Lamm</a> was joined in January 2007 by <a>Bill Owens</a>.</p>
<p>Denver is one of the few schools in the US that personally interviews every undergraduate applicant (with interviews in more than 25 cities per year), demonstrating that the university is very interested in the person, not just the applicant's credentials.
<p>The Ricks Center For Gifted Children is a private school on the campus of DU that teaches preschool through eighth grade.
Since April 1997, the school has been accredited by The North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCACASI).
It was founded and is currently directed by Norma Hafenstien.</p>
The longest-standing building is University Hall, which has served DU since 1890.
Just a few blocks off campus also hosts the historic Chamberlin Observatory, built in 1894.
It is still a fully operational observatory and is open to the public twice a week as well as one Saturday a month.

<p>Evans Chapel, an 1870s-vintage small church which was once located in downtown Denver, was relocated to the DU campus in the 1960s, and Buchtel Tower (1913), which is all that remains of the former Buchtel Chapel, which burned in 1983.
<p>Under the leadership of former Chancellor Daniel Ritchie (now Chairman of the <a>Denver Center for Performing Arts</a>), about $500 million in capital improvements have taken place in the last decade and the learning inside these new buildings has improved in the same period, as admissions selectivity and rankings have improved dramatically.</p>
<p>In autumn 2003, DU opened a new $63.5 million facility for its College of Law, what was later named the &quot;Sturm College of Law.&quot;
The building includes a three-<a>story</a> <a>library</a> with <a>personal computer</a>s accessible to students.
Donald and Susan Sturm, owners of Denver-based American National Bank, had given $20 million to the University of Denver College of Law.
<p>The Daniels College of Business was completed in September 1999 at the cost of $25 million dollars.
<p>Additionally, the university also recently opened the $75 million <a>Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts</a>, which houses the acclaimed Lamont School of Music.
The Center includes June Swaner Gates Concert Hall, a 1,000 seat, four-level opera house, the Frederic C. Hamilton Family Recital Hall, a 250-seat recital hall with the largest (3,000 pipes) &quot;tracker&quot; organ in the region, and the Elizabeth Ericksen Byron Theatre, a 300-seat flexible theatre space.
The Newman Center serves as home to many professional performing arts groups from the Denver region as well as the University's <em>Newman Center Presents</em> multi-disciplinary performing arts series.</p>
<p>In the last two years, DU has also built and opened a new building for the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management (Fritz Knoebel School of Hospitality Management).
The program had its first graduating class in 1946.</p>
<p>The university has the second highest telescope in the world located at 14,148 feet near the summit of <a>Mount Evans</a> called the <a>Meyer-Womble Observatory</a>.
This telescope is most commonly used by the university's Natural Science and Mathematics Department, and more specifically the Department of Physics and Astronomy at DU.</p>
<p>Nagel Residence Hall was completed in the Fall of 2008 to house upperclassman and is one of the most unique buildings on campus, offering a wide collection of art throughout the building donated by the Nagel family.
The building is certified Gold in LEED standards to be environmentally friendly and more sustainable.
As well as Nagel, Nelson Hall is another LEED residence hall that was built in the last eight years.</p>
<p>In reference to campus improvements to help DU athletics, as well as the Ritchie Center that was completed in 2000, DU completed the first ever lacrosse stadium that is specifically designed for the sport.
<p>The environmentally friendly $25 million dollar Morgridge College of Education was opened in June 2010.</p>
Ice hockey is DU's flagship spectator sport, with seven NCAA titles including back to back crowns in 2004 and 2005, and regularly selling out the new 6,000 seat <a>Magness Arena</a> on campus, the showpiece of the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness.
<p><a>140px|left|thumb|Ritchie Center Tower</a> <a>Skiing</a> is another strong sport at Denver, with 21 NCAA titles (more than any other school) with the Pioneers dominating the current decade.
The Pioneers &quot;three-peated&quot; with NCAA titles in 2010, 2009 and 2008, won it in 2005 and as well as three consecutive titles from 2001 to 2003.</p>
<p>The fight song for the University of Denver is <em>Fairest of Colleges,</em> written in 1916.
<li><a>Denver Boone</a>/Boone the Pioneer (1968 to 1998)</li>
<p>Although the DU community indulged the Department of Athletics and Recreation's 1998 efforts to rebrand itself by creating a more marketable image, replacing &quot;<a>Denver Boone</a>&quot; with &quot;Ruckus&quot; was met with a lukewarm response and never gained much traction.
By 2006, a movement to bring back the Walt Disney creation had begun to gain momentum.
In 2008, a survey of the DU community showed an overwhelming 87% supported reclaiming Boone.
Nonetheless, on October 20, 2008, Chancellor Robert Coombe opposed the will of the overwhelming majority via an email to students, citing that Boone &quot;does not reflect the broad diversity of the DU community&quot;.
The issue has been covered by the <em>Denver Post</em>, NBC affiliate KUSA , and ABC affiliate KMGH.
Editorials by Valerie Richardson in the <em>Washington Times</em> and <a>Mike Rosen</a> in the <em>Rocky Mountain News</em>, Boone's departure was far from final.
Chancellor Coombe had acknowledged Boone's place in DU's history and stated that &quot;it seems reasonable that students and alumni be allowed to use the image as a celebration of that past, to the extent that they may choose.&quot;</p>
A costume was privately procured and the initiative was funded entirely by independent alumni contributions.</p>
<p>The new mascot was unveiled by students and alumni at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, as part of the 2009 Frozen Four festivities.</p>
