established$$$@@@%%%<p> The <strong>University of Denver</strong> (<strong>DU</strong>), founded in 1864, is the oldest <a>private</a> <a>university</a> in the <a>Rocky Mountain Region</a> of the <a>United States</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The University of Denver is a <a>coeducation</a>al, four-year <a>university</a> in <a>Denver</a>, <a>Colorado</a>.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%DU currently enrolls approximately 11,400 <a>student</a>s, divided between graduate and undergraduate programs.
established$$$@@@%%%The  main campus is a designated <a>arboretum</a> and is located primarily in the <a>University Neighborhood</a>,&lt;!--- DU is NOT in University Park.
campus$$$@@@%%%Please see the reference and the talk page ---&gt; about seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of downtown Denver.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Background</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university was founded in 1864 as the Colorado Seminary by <a>John Evans</a>, the former <a>Governor</a> of <a>Colorado Territory</a>, who had been appointed by <a>President</a> <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%John Evans, who also founded <a>Northwestern University</a> prior to founding DU, is the namesake of the town in <a>Illinois</a> named <a>Evanston</a> (the site of the Northwestern campus) as well as <a>Mount Evans</a>, a 14,264 foot mountain visible from the DU campus.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>275px|right|thumb|Mary Reed Hall</a> Evans founded the school to help civilize the newly-created (1858) City of <a>Denver</a>, which was little more than a mining camp at that time.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As a co-educational institution, according to College Board, under a competitive standard, the average admitted applicant is at his or her top 25% of their graduating class.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The reverse initials &quot;DU&quot; are used as the university's shorthand moniker (rather than the more intuitive &quot;UD&quot;) as part of a Rocky Mountain and midwestern tradition of initial reversal, similar to the University of Colorado's &quot;CU&quot;, the University of Tulsa's &quot;TU&quot;, the University of Oklahoma's &quot;OU&quot;, the University of Nebraska's &quot;NU&quot;, and the University of Kansas' &quot;KU.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The 'Colorado Seminary' was founded as a <a>Methodist</a> institution and struggled in the early years of its existence.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1880, the Colorado Seminary had been renamed the University of Denver.
established$$$@@@%%%Although doing business as the University of Denver, DU is still legally named Colorado Seminary.
established$$$@@@%%%The first buildings of the university were located in downtown <a>Denver</a> in the 1860s and 1870s, but concerns that Denver's rough-and-tumble frontier town atmosphere was not conducive to education prompted a new campus (today's campus) to be built on the donated land of potato farmer Rufus Clark, some seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of the downtown core.
established$$$@@@%%%The university grew and prospered alongside the city's growth, appealing primarily to a regional student body prior to <a>World War II</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%After the war, the large surge in <a>GI bill</a> students pushed DU's enrollment to over 13,000 students, the largest the university has ever been, and helped to spread the university's reputation to a national audience.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Although the DU community indulged the Department of Athletics and Recreation's 1998 efforts to rebrand itself by creating a more marketable image, replacing &quot;<a>Denver Boone</a>&quot; with &quot;Ruckus&quot; was met with a lukewarm response and never gained much traction.
established$$$@@@%%%By 2006, a movement to bring back the Walt Disney creation had begun to gain momentum.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2008, a survey of the DU community showed an overwhelming 87% supported reclaiming Boone.
established$$$@@@%%%Nonetheless, on October 20, 2008, Chancellor Robert Coombe opposed the will of the overwhelming majority via an email to students, citing that Boone &quot;does not reflect the broad diversity of the DU community&quot;.
campus$$$@@@%%%Princeton Review indicates that minorities compose just 7% of the student body.
established$$$@@@%%%The issue has been covered by the <em>Denver Post</em>, NBC affiliate KUSA , and ABC affiliate KMGH.
established$$$@@@%%%Editorials by Valerie Richardson in the <em>Washington Times</em> and <a>Mike Rosen</a> in the <em>Rocky Mountain News</em>, Boone's departure was far from final.
established$$$@@@%%%Chancellor Coombe had acknowledged Boone's place in DU's history and stated that &quot;it seems reasonable that students and alumni be allowed to use the image as a celebration of that past, to the extent that they may choose.&quot;</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Thus, an independent group of alumni resurrected &quot;<a>Denver Boone</a>&quot; on their own as the unofficial mascot of the DU students and alumni community.
established$$$@@@%%%A costume was privately procured and the initiative was funded entirely by independent alumni contributions.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The new mascot was unveiled by students and alumni at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, as part of the 2009 Frozen Four festivities.</p>
