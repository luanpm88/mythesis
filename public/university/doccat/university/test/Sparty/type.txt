<strong>Sparty</strong> is the <a>mascot</a> of <a>Michigan State University</a>.
While MSU students and <a>alumni</a> often refer to the <em>Spartan</em> statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility is that of a <a>costume</a>d <a>mascot</a> who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions.
He also appeared in ESPN ads with background cameos, such as eating in a <a>diner</a> booth or browsing the shelves of a bookstore.
In the summer of 2006, <a>Alltel Wireless</a> aired a commercial featuring ESPN's <a>Lee Corso</a> and Sparty.</p>
