Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular male <a>Sparta</a>n warrior/athlete dressed in stylized <a>Greek</a> costume.
After changing the team name from &quot;<a>Aggies</a>&quot; to &quot;Spartans&quot; in 1925, various incarnations of a Spartan warrior with a prominent chin appeared at university events and in university literature.
In 1943, MSU art professor <a>Leonard D. Jungwirth</a> designed a statue for the university, which had to be cast in <a>terra cotta</a> because of <a>World War II</a> rationing.
In 2005, the university replaced Jungwirth's original statue with a bronze replica, moving the original indoors to protect it from the elements.</p>
In printed literature, the university uses a copyrighted <a>cartoon</a> Spartan, usually drawn with a grimace and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of &quot;Gruff&quot; Sparty.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though MSU is now a large university, in the 19th century it was a small <a>agricultural</a> college known as the State Agricultural College of Michigan.
Thus, when the college fielded its first intercollegiate sports teams in the 1880s, the teams were appropriately named the <a>Aggies</a>.
By 1925, the school had expanded beyond agriculture, becoming Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science.
The chosen entry was the &quot;Michigan Staters.&quot;
Alderton and Stafford began using the name in their game accounts, and it soon caught on as the <em><a>de facto</a></em> team name.

The costume, with a <a>cartoon</a>ishly oversized <a>head</a>, bulging <a>muscle</a>s, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 <a>football</a> season.
Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts and vinyl breastplate have a freedom of movement that allow the <a>anonymous</a> student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume's fixed stare.
Sparty came to national prominence in the mid-1990s with his appearance in <a>a series of television ads</a> promoting <a>ESPN</a>'s <em><a>Sports Center</a></em>.
One advertisement depicted Sparty carrying gymnast <a>Kerri Strug</a> in the manner of <em><a>Beauty and the Beast</a></em>&mdash;or, more to the point, <a>B&#x00e9;la K&#x00e1;rolyi</a>, who carried the injured Strug to the medal platform to accept <a>her team gold medal</a> at the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a>.
He won Best Mascot for the second year in a row after securing the honor again the following year.
In addition to his title of &quot;best mascot,&quot; Sparty was voted the &quot;Buffest Mascot&quot; by <em><a>Muscle and Fitness</a></em> magazine.
Sparty was even found in the refrigerators of local stores and many alumni when Sparty was featured on a series of <a>Jones Soda</a> bottles in late 2004, and he appeared again in 2005.
Sparty was one of six college mascots nominated for the <a>Mascot Hall of Fame</a> in July 2006.
It was Sparty's third title in just four years.
His skit, &quot;Sparty's Spectacular,&quot; featured music from many different genres, including <a>rock</a>, <a>country</a>, and <a>Riverdance</a>.
<p>Sparty appears on the cover of the <a>Wii</a> version of <em><a>NCAA Football 09</a></em>, the first time a non-athlete has graced the cover.
<p> When <a>John Hannah</a> became president of Michigan State College in 1941, he commissioned <a>assistant professor</a> of <a>art</a> Leonard D. Jungwirth to design a statue of an athletic Spartan warrior.
Though Jungwirth originally designed <em>The Spartan</em> as a <a>bronze</a> statue, it had to be cast in <a>terra cotta</a> due to <a>World War II</a> <a>rationing</a> of bronze.
These pieces were joined by <a>mortar</a> joints, with a poured <a>concrete</a> core over a <a>steel</a> frame.
The statue stands 9&#x2019;&nbsp;7&quot; high and weighs approximately 3,000&nbsp;pounds.
When the statue was erected, popular media claimed that it was the tallest free-standing ceramic sculpture in the world, While annual repair work helped stem the damage done by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.</p>
New molds were made in 2004, because the 1989 molds had deteriorated, to cast an identical <a>bronze</a> replica that will better stand up to bad weather and vandalism.</p>
<p>The terra cotta <em>Spartan</em> was removed from its base on May 12, 2005.
During MSU's 2005 summer <a>semester</a>, the intersection at which the statue stood was completely redesigned to allow for safer <a>traffic</a> interaction with <a>pedestrians</a>.
On Thursday, August 25, 2005, an unveiling of the new bronze <em>Spartan</em> took place.
In addition, a <a>Sesquicentennial</a> parade on Saturday, October 8, 2005, concluded with a dedication ceremony at the statue.
Meanwhile, the original terra cotta <em>Spartan</em> was moved to a new <a>Spartan Stadium</a> annex where it could be displayed safely indoors.
Though most members of the MSU community agree that the original statue needs to be sheltered, some alumni and faculty have criticized the inaccessibility of the original statue.</p>
