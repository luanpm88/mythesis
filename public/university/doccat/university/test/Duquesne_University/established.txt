Founded by members of the <a>Congregation of the Holy Spirit</a>, Duquesne (, locally  ) first opened its doors as the Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost in October 1878 with an enrollment of 40 students and a faculty of six.
In 1911, the college became a university, the first Catholic institution of higher learning in Pennsylvania to achieve such a distinction.
It is the only Spiritan institution of higher education in the world.
<p>Duquesne has since expanded to over 10,000 graduate and undergraduate students within a self-contained  hilltop campus in Pittsburgh's <a>Bluff</a> neighborhood.
The school maintains associate campuses in <a>Harrisburg</a> and Rome and encompasses ten schools of study.
Duquesne's <a>MBA</a> program is ranked 8th in the world by the Aspen Institute.</p>
<p>Duquesne University can count more than 79,000 living alumni When the college was founded, it had six faculty members and 40 students.
The college obtained its state charter in 1882.
Duquesne University continues to expand with its completion of the Power Center, a mixed-use development project on Forbes Avenue, and a new residence hall, to be completed in 2011.</p>
<p>The <a>Catholic Charismatic Renewal</a> as it exists today is the outgrowth from a retreat held in February 1967 of several faculty members and students from Duquesne University.</p>

<h3>Seal and coat of arms</h3>
<p>The Duquesne University <a>coat of arms</a> was adapted from that of the family of the Marquis du Quesne.
However, a red book was added to adapt the arms of a French governor to that of a university.
They were then examined and partly revised by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, a prominent <a>ecclesiastical heraldic artist</a> at the time.
The design was adopted early in 1923 and used for the first time carved in <a>high relief</a> above Canevin Hall, then under construction.
The first time the arms were incorporated into the seal of the university was for the commencement program of 1926.</p>
<p>The formal <a>heraldic</a> <a>blazon</a> of the arms is as follows: <em>Argent, a lion Sable armed and langued Gules holding a book of the same edged Or; on a chief party per pale Azure and of the third, a dove displayed of the first, areoled of the fourth; motto, &quot;Spiritus est qui vivificat.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Alumnus <a>Joseph Carl Breil</a>, class of 1888, notable as being the first person to compose a score specifically for a motion picture, also composed the music for Duquesne University's <a>alma mater</a>.
The first performance of the song was in October 1920.</p>
:<em>The hours we spent at thy Mother knee and drank of wisdom's store</em> :<em>Shall e'er in mem'ry treasured be, tho' we roam the whole world o'er.</em>
<p>The Duquesne University <a>class ring</a> was first adopted in the 1920s, the same decade as the seal and alma mater.
The first incarnation was approved by a 1925 student committee, and was an &quot;octagonal deep blue stone held in place by four corner prongs.&quot;
The ring's design continued to evolve until 1936, as the prongs were replaced with a continuous metal <a>bezel</a>.
The words &quot;Duquesne&quot;, &quot;University&quot;, and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, accompanied the graduation year around the four sides of the bezel, and the shank on both sides was decorated with a motif adapted from the university's coat of arms.
Originally an option, the embossed gold <a>Gothic</a> initial &quot;D&quot; became standard in the late 1930s.
The Duquesne alumni website notes, &quot;The golden initial, oversized stone and octagonal shape make the Duquesne ring stand out from those of other colleges and universities.&quot;

In October of 2010 the university announced the purchase of the eight story,  building at 600 Fifth Avenue from Robert Morris University which had been RMU's Pittsburgh Center.
