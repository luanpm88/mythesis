Founded in 1974 by <a>Tibetan Buddhist</a> teacher and <a>Oxford University</a> scholar <a>Ch&#x00f6;gyam Trungpa</a>, it is named for the eleventh-century Indian Buddhist sage <a>Naropa</a>, an abbot of <a>Nalanda</a>.</p>
<p>Naropa was accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1988, making it the first Buddhist, or Buddhist-inspired, academic institution to receive United States <a>regional accreditation</a>.
<p>Besides spirituality, Naropa is noteworthy for having hosted a number of <a>Beat poets</a> under the auspices of its &quot;<a>Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

Naropa University was founded by <a>Ch&#x00f6;gyam Trungpa</a>, an exiled Tibetan <a>tulku</a> who was a <a>Karma Kagyu</a> and <a>Nyingma</a> lineage holder, and scholar of comparative religion at <a>Oxford University</a> in <a>England</a>.
Trungpa entered the USA in 1970, established the <a>Vajradhatu</a> organization in 1973, and then in 1974, established Naropa Institute under the Nalanda Foundation.
Initially, the Nalanda Foundation and Vajradhatu were closely linked, having nearly identical boards of directors.
<p>Trungpa asked poets <a>Allen Ginsberg</a>, <a>Anne Waldman</a>, <a>John Cage</a> and <a>Diane di Prima</a> to found a poetics department at Naropa during the first summer session.
Ginsberg and Waldman, who roomed together that first summer, came up with the name for the <a>Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics</a>.</p>
These included a BA in Buddhist studies and visual art, MA in psychology, MFA in visual art, and expressive arts certificates in dance, theater and poetics.</p>
<p>The MA in psychology was originally designed as an extension of Trungpa's Maitri program&#x2014;a 16-week meditation course held in Connecticut, and based on <a>Vajrayana</a> teachings on esoteric energy patterns within the mind and body.
Initially for the degree, students were required to attend three of the institute&#x2019;s summer sessions, take two Maitri programs in Connecticut and complete a six-month independent project.</p>
Evaluation visits continued through 1986 and, in 1988, Naropa Institute received accreditation from the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
One of Wulsin's first acts was to formally separate Naropa from Vajradhatu.
Ties with Vajradhatu were further weakened with the physical relocation of Vajradhatu's main center to <a>Halifax</a>, and then by Trungpa's death in 1987.</p>
<p>Naropa promotes contemplative education&#x2014;a term used primarily by teachers associated with Naropa University or <a>Shambhala Buddhist</a> organizations&#x2014;including activities such as <a>meditation</a>, the <a>Japanese tea ceremony</a>, <a>taijiquan</a>, <a>Christian labyrinth</a>, <a>ikebana</a>, and <a>neo-pagan</a> ritual.
<p>:Geoffrey Samuel, Reginald Ray, and Judith Simmer-Brown have traced the Shambhala lineage [Trungpa's teaching] back to the nineteenth-century <a>Rimed movement</a> in Eastern Tibet...
Nonsectarian does not, however, mean 'secular' as it is commonly used in higher education.
Nonsectarian is perhaps understood as ecumenical openness to contemplative practices and arts of the world religious traditions that foster precision, gentleness, and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Goss goes on to note that as with many U.S. Protestant and Catholic colleges and universities, Naropa has faced pressure to establish independence from its associated religious organization, <a>Shambhala International</a>; but unlike many such institutions, it has avoided relegating religion to the periphery of university life.</p>
For example, its catalogue speaks of &quot;students wholeheartedly engag[ing] in mindfulness awareness practices in order to cultivate being present in the moment&quot;...&quot;the development of openness, self-awareness and insight&quot;...and &quot;interior work&quot; as &quot;preparation for compassionate and transformative work in the world.&quot;</p>
On this day members of the Naropa community&#x2014;students, faculty, staff, and others&#x2014;are invited to participate in group sitting <a>meditation</a> practice during the morning.
The stated object of the day is to cultivate togetherness in the Naropa community and to emphasize the importance of leading a mindful, aware life rather than a high-speed, cluttered one.</p>
<p>In 1979 student editor Tom Clark published &#x2018;&#x2019;The Great Naropa Poetry Wars&#x201d;, revealing that during a 1975 <a>Halloween</a> party, Trungpa had ordered the poet <a>W.S. Merwin</a> and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, (present for a three-month seminary program) to take off their clothes.
(This was during the 3rd Vajradhatu Seminary held in <a>Snowmass, Colorado</a>.)
Merwin and Naone resisted, whereupon members of Trungpa&#x2019;s &#x201c;Vajra Guard&#x201d; (security) stripped them naked, despite their protests and calls for the police.
The school later asked <a>Ed Sanders</a> and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.</p>
<p><a>Eliot Weinberger</a> commented on the incident, in a critique aimed at Trungpa and <a>Allen Ginsberg</a> published in <a>The Nation</a> on April 19, 1980.
He complained that Trungpa had successfully captured some of the best minds of his generation, yet he believed their fascination with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism in literature.</p>
