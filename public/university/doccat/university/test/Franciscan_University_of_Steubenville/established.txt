The school (originally named the &quot;College of Steubenville&quot;) was founded in 1946 by the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular.
Michael Scanlan, TOR</a>, became president and began a series of major reforms to restore the school to its Catholic heritage.
In 1985, the University changed its name from &quot;College of Steubenville&quot; to &quot;University of Steubenville,&quot; and in 1985 to &quot;Franciscan University of Steubenville.&quot;</p>
The University operates on the American <a>semester</a> system.

Hundreds of students make a weekly commitment to <a>Eucharistic adoration</a>, and most Masses have standing room only, even on weekdays.
The Works of Mercy Program places students shoulder-to-shoulder with the poor and marginalized in inner city and rural communities.
