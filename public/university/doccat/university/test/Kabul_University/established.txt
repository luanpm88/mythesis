<p>&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSSION BEFORE CHANGING THE UNIVERSITY NAME TO PASHTO!!!!! --&gt;  The <strong>Kabul University</strong> (<strong>KU</strong>) is located in <a>Kabul</a>, capital of <a>Afghanistan</a>.
It was founded in 1931 but officially opened for classes in 1932.
The university is still recovering from the long period of war and chaos in the country.
<p>Kabul University consists of 14 faculties in fields of <a>Agriculture</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Pharmacy</a>, <a>Islamic Studies</a>, <a>Law</a>, Language and <a>Literature</a>, <a>Science</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Journalism</a>, <a>Veterinary medicine</a>, <a>Social Science</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Geoscience</a> and <a>Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>There is some debate on the name of the university.
Officially, the university is known by the <a>Pashto</a> name <em>Da K&#x0101;bul Pohant&#x016b;n</em> (<strong>&#x062f;&#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644; &#x067e;&#x0648;&#x0647;&#x0646;&#x062a;&#x0648;&#x0646;</strong>).
Recently, it has been suggested to use three different official names in Pashto, Persian (<strong>&#x062f;&#x0627;&#x0646;&#x0634;&#x06af;&#x0627;&#x0647; &#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644;</strong> - <em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e K&#x0101;bul</em>), and English (<em>University of Kabul</em>); most of all, because Persian-speaking students feel discriminated by the governmental ban of the Persian word for university.
This lead to a clash between students and the police in November 2008, as mostly Persian-speaking students demanded to lift the ban on Persian words.</p>
<p>Previously, the <em>Minister of Culture, Information, Tourism and Youth Affairs</em>, <a>Karim Khoram</a>, had officially banned the use of Persian expressions in government institutions and in state-controlled media, As a result, that university's name was officially changed from Pashto (<em>Pohant&#x016b;n-e Balkh</em>) to Persian (<em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e Balkh</em>).</p>
