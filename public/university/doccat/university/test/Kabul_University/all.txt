established$$$@@@%%%<p>&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSSION BEFORE CHANGING THE UNIVERSITY NAME TO PASHTO!!!!! --&gt;  The <strong>Kabul University</strong> (<strong>KU</strong>) is located in <a>Kabul</a>, capital of <a>Afghanistan</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was founded in 1931 but officially opened for classes in 1932.
president$$$@@@%%%Kabul University is currently attended by approximately 7,000 students, of which 1,700 are women.
established$$$@@@%%%The university is still recovering from the long period of war and chaos in the country.
staff$$$@@@%%%The main building was rebuilt about 500 meters from the old one, which has almost the same design.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Name</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>There is some debate on the name of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%Officially, the university is known by the <a>Pashto</a> name <em>Da K&#x0101;bul Pohant&#x016b;n</em> (<strong>&#x062f;&#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644; &#x067e;&#x0648;&#x0647;&#x0646;&#x062a;&#x0648;&#x0646;</strong>).
established$$$@@@%%%Recently, it has been suggested to use three different official names in Pashto, Persian (<strong>&#x062f;&#x0627;&#x0646;&#x0634;&#x06af;&#x0627;&#x0647; &#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644;</strong> - <em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e K&#x0101;bul</em>), and English (<em>University of Kabul</em>); most of all, because Persian-speaking students feel discriminated by the governmental ban of the Persian word for university.
established$$$@@@%%%This lead to a clash between students and the police in November 2008, as mostly Persian-speaking students demanded to lift the ban on Persian words.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Previously, the <em>Minister of Culture, Information, Tourism and Youth Affairs</em>, <a>Karim Khoram</a>, had officially banned the use of Persian expressions in government institutions and in state-controlled media, As a result, that university's name was officially changed from Pashto (<em>Pohant&#x016b;n-e Balkh</em>) to Persian (<em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e Balkh</em>).</p>
