<h2>History</h2>
<p>  The University of Calcutta is the oldest of the modern universities in India.
It has so far produced 4 Nobelists, more than any other Indian university: <a>Ronald Ross</a>, <a>Rabindra Nath Tagore</a>, <a>C.
It was founded in 1857 during the administration of <a>Lord Canning</a>, the <a>Governor General of India</a>.
Dr <a>Fredrick John</a>, the education secretary to the then British Government in India, first tendered a proposal to the British Government in London for the establishment of a university in Calcutta, similar to London University, to create an educated class that would help them rule India; at that time the plan failed to obtain the necessary approval.
However, a proposal to establish two universities, one in Calcutta and the other in Bombay was later accepted in 1854 and the necessary authority was given.
The <a>Calcutta University Act</a> came into force on 24 January 1857 and a 41-member Senate was formed as the policy making body of the university.
When the university was first established it had a <a>catchment area</a> covering the area from <a>Lahore</a> to <a>Rangoon</a> (now in <a>Myanmar</a>) , and <a>Ceylon</a>, the largest of any Indian university.
