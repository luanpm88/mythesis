<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Central Oklahoma was founded on December 24, 1890, when the Territorial Legislature voted to establish the Territorial Normal School, making UCO the oldest institution of higher education in Oklahoma.
Classes were first held in November 1891, whereas Oklahoma A&amp;M College held its first classes in December 1891 and the University of Oklahoma began in fall 1892.</p>
<p>The Territorial Legislature located the new school in Edmond, provided certain conditions were met.
First, <a>Oklahoma County</a> had to donate $5,000 in bonds, and Edmond had to donate  of land within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the town; the land was eventually donated by Anton Classen.
Ten of those acres had to be set aside for the new school.
The remaining land had to be divided into lots which would be sold to raise money for the new school.
On Oct. 1, 1891 Richard Thatcher was elected the 1st President of Territorial Normal School of Oklahoma.</strong></p>
<p>The conditions all were met, with the city of Edmond donating an additional $2,000 in bonds.
The first class, a group of 23 students, met for the first time Nov. 1, 1891, in the Epworth League Room, located in the unfurnished First Methodist Church.
A marker of Oklahoma granite was placed in 1915 near the original site by the Central Oklahoma Normal School Historical Society.
It can be seen at Boulevard and Second Street.</p>
<p>Old North Tower was the first building constructed in the summer of 1892 on the campus of what was then Territorial Normal School.
The school first operated as a <a>normal school</a> with two years of college work and a complete preparatory school.
In 1897, the first graduating class&mdash;two men and three women&mdash;received their Normal School <a>diplomas</a>.</p>
<p>In 1904, Territorial Normal became Central State Normal School.
On Dec. 29, 1919, the State Board of Education passed a resolution making Central a four-year teachers&#x2019; college conferring bachelor's degrees.
From 1901 until 1961, UCO housed a laboratory school in which local elementary schoolchildren were schooled by UCO faculty and soon-to-be teaching graduates.</p>
<p>Two years later, the Class of 1921 had nine members, the first graduates to receive the four-year degrees.
Two decades later, Central State Teacher's College became Central State College.
In 1939, the <a>Oklahoma Legislature</a> authorized the institution to grant both <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1941, Central State became part of a coordinated state system of post-secondary education overseen by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education, and joined institutions with similar missions as a regional institution.</p>
In 1971, the college was authorized to grant the <a>Master of Arts</a> in English and the <a>Master of Business Administration</a> degrees.</p>
<p>On April 13, 1971, the state legislature officially changed the institution's name to Central State University.
Old North Tower was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
On May 18, 1990, during the university's Centennial Year, legislation was passed changing the name to the University of Central Oklahoma, though many of the students still refer to the University as &quot;Central&quot; or &quot;Central State.&quot;
