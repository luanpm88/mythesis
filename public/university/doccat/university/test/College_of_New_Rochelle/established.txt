The College of St. Angela was founded by the Order of the <a>Ursulines</a> as the first Catholic <a>women's college</a> in New York state in 1904, a time when women were generally excluded from higher education.
The name was changed to the College of New Rochelle in 1910.
Building on its original commitment to women, the college reaches out to those who have not previously had access to higher education.
It places particular emphasis on the concept of life long learning.
<p><a>left|300px</a> Following the university model, the College of New Rochelle is composed of four separate schools: </p>
<li>School of New Resources (for adult learners)  </li>
<p>Its oldest school, the School of Arts &amp; Sciences was established in 1904 as a <a>women's college</a> and still enrolls only women students.
It offers courses in the <a>liberal arts</a>, pre-medicine, pre-law, communication arts and business.
Both men and women may enroll in the School of Nursing, the School of New Resources (for adult learners) and the Graduate School.
<p>The College of New Rochelle is chartered by the <a>Regents</a> of the State of <a>New York</a> and is accredited by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools</a>.
The School of Nursing is accredited by the <a>National League for Nursing</a>.
<p>The School's current President is Stephen Sweeny, Ph.D., who is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors for <a>La Salle Academy</a>.</p>
In 1896, the college's founder, Mother Irene Gill, traveled to New Rochelle to explore the possibility of establishing a seminary there for young women.
It was during this trip that she came across <a>Leland Castle</a>, an 1850s <a>gothic revival</a> structure and former vacation home of wealthy New York hotelier Simeon Leland.
The castle was purchased in 1897 and became the first structure of the College.
The castle is part of the campus quadrangle and currently houses the &quot;Castle Gallery&quot;.
<p>With competitions offered in Basketball, Volleyball, Softball, Tennis, Swimming, and Cross Country, the College offers a varied and competitive program.
Cheerleading is offered as a year-round program administered by the Athletic Department.
<p>The Mission of the Intercollegiate Athletics Department is to support and realize the Shared Vision of the College and in particular, the Student Services Philosophy and Statement of Mission and Goals by:</p>
<li>Developing a clear sense of abilities and promoting a sense of worth as individuals and as members of a team;</li>
<li>Developing the capacity for ethical decision making; </li>
<li>Carrying the name of the College to the general public and our positive image, winning attitudes, thus participating in advancing and enriching the community of the campus.
<li>As an integral component of the total learning experience it will lead to the student-athletes overall enrichment, growth, and development; and </li>
<li>Intercollegiate competition promotes a positive atmosphere and contributes to the physical, social, mental, and emotional advancement of the student-athlete.</li>
<h5>History</h5>
<p>The first mention of sports at CNR is in the St. Angela&#x2019;s Quarterly in 1905.
A coach was hired to organize a basketball team.
By 1908, annual inter-class athletic meets began between the &#x201c;odds&#x201d; and &#x201c;evens&#x201d; (year of graduation).
The meets became a focus of inter-class spirit and competition&#x2014;often reaching a fevered pitch.
Each class had its own colors, banners, and songs which were brought out for the meet.
Ingenious ways and places of getting the class banner to the highest point on campus put lives in peril as students scaled trees, sneaked up to the Castle towers, or climbed onto roofs to place the class banner.
Later, track and field competitions were held and awards were given.
<p>In less than 30 years, the growing College needed a much larger and more modern gymnasium than the gym in Chidwick.
In 1932, at the height of the Depression, the ultra-modern Art Deco Sports Building was completed&#x2014;with a pool, gymnasium, social rooms, equipment, and exercise rooms.
In later years, a full CNR scholarship was offered every four years, fundraised by the Athletic Association through sponsored games and dances.</p>
<p>Sports lost some of their appeal during the politically-turbulent late 1960s-1970s, but the annual Swimphony/Landphony water and land ballet competition begun when the pool was opened continued to spark class spirit and inter-class competition into the 1990s.
Exercise equipment was added in the 1970s, and the pool was often opened in the summer to day camps and residents of Residence Park.</p>
<p>The College of New Rochelle joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association during the mid 1980s.
CNR&#x2019;s basketball team took the name &#x201c;Blue Angels&#x201d; and won a number of local championships, a state championship and a NCAA Tournament bid, losing in the Championship Game.</p>
They have continued to place in the top echelon of the HVWAC, with the Volleyball Team winning the Championship.</p>
<p><strong><a>Hudson Valley Women's Athletic Conference (HVWAC)</a></strong>&lt;br /&gt; This is the local conference consisting of colleges in the Greater New York area.
<p><strong><a>Association of Division III Independents (AD3I)</a></strong>&lt;br /&gt; The Association of Division III Independents has evolved from an association where the purpose was to provide a unified voice to issues of common concern for independent institutions, to operating more like a conference in terms of offering exempted postseason championship opportunities, and enhanced recognition and stats programs for outstanding independent student-athletes.
<p>The mission is to continue to create a sense of belonging for member institutions and participating student-athletes, and establish a more tangible presence for the association on member campuses.</p>
<p>Participating in student clubs and organizations provides students with the opportunity to discover new talents, make new friends, and gain exposure to various professions.</p>
