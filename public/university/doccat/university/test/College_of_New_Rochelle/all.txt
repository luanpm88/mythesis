established$$$@@@%%%<h5>History</h5>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The first mention of sports at CNR is in the St. Angela&#x2019;s Quarterly in 1905.
established$$$@@@%%%A coach was hired to organize a basketball team.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1908, annual inter-class athletic meets began between the &#x201c;odds&#x201d; and &#x201c;evens&#x201d; (year of graduation).
established$$$@@@%%%The meets became a focus of inter-class spirit and competition&#x2014;often reaching a fevered pitch.
established$$$@@@%%%Each class had its own colors, banners, and songs which were brought out for the meet.
established$$$@@@%%%Ingenious ways and places of getting the class banner to the highest point on campus put lives in peril as students scaled trees, sneaked up to the Castle towers, or climbed onto roofs to place the class banner.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Held in the fall and spring, the meets initially involved gymnastic drills as well as basketball.
established$$$@@@%%%Later, track and field competitions were held and awards were given.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The meets continued until the early 1940s.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Intramural sports were popular--basketball, volleyball, golf, hockey, tennis, and riding.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1916, CNR began playing basketball with other college teams.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In less than 30 years, the growing College needed a much larger and more modern gymnasium than the gym in Chidwick.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1932, at the height of the Depression, the ultra-modern Art Deco Sports Building was completed&#x2014;with a pool, gymnasium, social rooms, equipment, and exercise rooms.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Athletic Association was open to anyone interested in sports, as a team member or supporter.
closed$$$@@@%%%Dues paid for some new equipment, parties, prizes, and speakers.
established$$$@@@%%%In later years, a full CNR scholarship was offered every four years, fundraised by the Athletic Association through sponsored games and dances.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Sports lost some of their appeal during the politically-turbulent late 1960s-1970s, but the annual Swimphony/Landphony water and land ballet competition begun when the pool was opened continued to spark class spirit and inter-class competition into the 1990s.
established$$$@@@%%%Exercise equipment was added in the 1970s, and the pool was often opened in the summer to day camps and residents of Residence Park.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College of New Rochelle joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association during the mid 1980s.
established$$$@@@%%%CNR&#x2019;s basketball team took the name &#x201c;Blue Angels&#x201d; and won a number of local championships, a state championship and a NCAA Tournament bid, losing in the Championship Game.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>The College also elevated the sports of volleyball, swimming, tennis, and softball to NCAA status.
free_label$$$@@@%%%CNR athletic teams have produced many successful team and individual records during their NCAA tenure.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Today, the &#x201c;Blue Angels&#x201d; remain an NCAA Division III Member and compete locally in the Hudson Valley Women&#x2019;s Athletic Conference and the New York State Women&#x2019;s Collegiate Athletic Association.
