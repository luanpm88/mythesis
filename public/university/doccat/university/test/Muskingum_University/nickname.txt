The school's motto is <em>&quot;Omni, Trinum, Perfectum&quot;</em>, Latin for <em>&quot;all perfect things are three-sided&quot;</em> a reference to both the <a>Christian</a> <a>Trinity</a> and Muskingum's mission to develop their students' minds, bodies and souls.
This 21st century instructional space features multi-media classrooms, computer-aided design laboratory, lecture hall, seminar rooms, exhibit hall, radio and television studios, a 250-seat theatre, recital hall and cinema, costume &amp; set design laboratories, tech support areas and an experimental theatre/rehearsal hall.</li>
In more recent years, the Muskingum women's softball teams have achieved considerable success, winning every OAC regular season championship since 1998 and the NCAA Division III national championship in 2001.
