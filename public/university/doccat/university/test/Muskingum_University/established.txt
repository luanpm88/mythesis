Founded in 1837, Muskingum University is affiliated with the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>, although since the 1960s the school's religious nature has significantly diminished.
<a>New Concord, Ohio</a> is located in far eastern <a>Muskingum County, OH</a>, which derives its name from the <a>Muskingum River</a>.
Hence the often misspelled and mispronounced Delaware Indian word <em>Muskingum</em> (translation- <em>&quot;village on the river bank&quot;</em> and/or <em>&quot;glare of an elk's eye&quot;</em>- there's a dispute) was used in naming the school.
In June 2009, the institution's name was changed from &quot;Muskingum College&quot; to &quot;Muskingum University&quot;.
New programs have recently been launched in digital media design, criminal justice, engineering, and a new Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) program is coming soon.
Muskingum is nationally known for its innovative PLUS program, a service which assists students with learning disabilities cope, adjust, and ultimately succeed in a higher learning environment.</p>
The beauty of the campus was recently captured in <em>&quot;A Song of the Seasons: Paintings by Jianmin Dou&quot;</em> by Donna Edsall and Yan Sun (2003).
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|left|John Knox Montgomery, Sr., President of Muskingum College 1904-1931 &amp; &quot;Father of Muskingum College&quot;</a> In 1827, the <a>National Road</a> (now <a>U.S. 40</a>) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as <a>Zane's Trace</a>.
A year later, the village of <a>New Concord, Ohio</a> was established by Scotch-Irish <a>Presbyterians</a>. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the <em>&quot;Friends of Education&quot;</em> in New Concord, led by New Concord residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held.
A year later, the <a>Ohio General Assembly</a> authorized the creation of a college in <a>New Concord, OH</a> after being petitioned by the <em>&quot;Friends of Education&quot;</em> committee.
On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened.
Miskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854.
In 1958, the <a>United Presbyterian Church of North America</a> (UPCNA) and the <a>Presbyterian Church in the United States of America</a> (PCUSA) merge together by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel.
<em>&quot;The school up on the hills&quot;</em>, as it is sometimes called by locals, offers <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level <a>Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology</a>,  <a>Master of Arts in Education</a>, and <a>Master of Arts in Teaching</a> graduate degrees.
The school offers 44 academic <a>majors</a> along with a large number of <a>minors</a>, 9 pre-professional programs (including <a>pre-law</a> and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure, all of which must be pursued within a strong <a>liberal arts</a> curriculum, known at Muskingum as the <em>&quot;Liberal Arts Essentials&quot;</em> (LAEs) (see below).

In front of the building is a large rock that was inscribed when the school first began with the statement <em>&quot;In God We Trust/Muskingum College/1837&quot;</em></a> Most of Muskingum's academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus.
Brown Chapel sits on the southeastern corner of the quad.</p>
<li><strong>Paul Hall</strong> (1873) is the oldest building on Muskingum's campus.
Two previous versions of this building burnt down early in the school's history.
The building, which currently houses the music department, is registered as a National Historic Site.</li>
Renovated in 1977, it contains art studios, the Louis Palmer Gallery and a 160 seat proscenium thrust theater.
<li><strong>The Little Theater</strong> (1900) was constructed for physical education purposes and remodeled in 1943 for theatrical use, and was used as classroom space primarily in theatre until it was torn down in 2009.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Chapel</strong> (1912) is a multi-purpose building which serves the College as a church, chapel, auditorium and classroom.
The Chapel was named for J.M. Brown, a benefactor of the College and long-time member of the school's board of trustees.</li>
<li><strong>Montgomery Hall</strong> (1921) is the administrative hub of the campus, containing administrative and faculty offices and classrooms.
The building is named for Dr. John Knox Montgomery Sr., president of Muskingum from 1904 until 1931, and the unofficial <em>&quot;Father of Muskingum College&quot;</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Cambridge Hall</strong> (1929) was built largely with funds contributed by citizens of nearby Cambridge, OH.
Along with classrooms, the business, English, political science, psychology, sociology, history departments.</li>

<p>Muskingum competes athletically in the <a>NCAA</a> as a Division III school and as one of the first and longest affiliated members of the <a>Ohio Athletic Conference</a> (OAC).
The school's main athletic rival is fellow OAC competitor the <a>Marietta College</a> Pioneers (which ironically was originally called the &quot;Muskingum Academy&quot; when established in 1797).
Muskingum fields teams in <a>American football</a>, women's <a>volleyball</a>, <a>baseball</a>, women's <a>softball</a>, <a>wrestling</a> and men's and women's indoor <a>track</a>, outdoor track, <a>soccer</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>cross country</a> and <a>golf</a>.
Muskingum has won 79 <a>Ohio Athletic Conference</a> (OAC) Championships, since the school joined the conference in 1923:</p>

<p>During the period between 1925- 1970 Muskingum was known as a football powerhouse in the OAC, led by college football Hall of Famer <a>Edgar Sherman</a>, first as a player and then as head coach.
Muskingum College's favorite son is former <a>astronaut</a> and U.S. senator <a>John Glenn</a>, who graduated with a <a>bachelor of science</a> in 1962, the same year he became the first American to orbit the Earth (Glenn also has an honorary degree from Muskingum from 1961, but the B.S. he earned in 1962 is an earned degree).
In 1983, John Glenn launched his <a>White House</a> bid from the Muskingum College quad in the heart of the campus.
Glenn also announced his retirement from the <a>United States Senate</a> in Brown Chapel on live national television in 1997.
Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the <a>Ohio State University</a>, with special conditions that Muskingum students would benefit from the collection at any time.
Muskingum received national media attention once again in 1998, when a 77 year old Glenn returned to space aboard the <a>Space Shuttle Discovery</a>, becoming the oldest person ever in space.</p>
