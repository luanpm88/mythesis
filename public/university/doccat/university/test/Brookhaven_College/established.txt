Brookhaven opened in 1978 and (excluding satellite campuses of the other DCCCD branches) is the newest DCCCD college.</p>
The Core Curriculum is guaranteed to transfer to public universities in Texas..  Career and technical education programs help prepare students for immediate entrance into the workforce.
<p>Continuing education classes offer personal or professional development in a variety of subjects including art, business, computers, health care careers, education, English for Speakers of Other Languages, music, nonprofit management, real estate and more.
These buildings include the  Ellison Miles Geotechnology Institute, one of three similar facilities nationwide to offer continuing professional development to professionals in the oil and gas industries, and the Brookhaven College School of the Arts (BCSA) expanded facility, with a  gallery, a renovated ceramics/kiln yard, Macintosh computer lab and a 680-seat performance hall.</p>
<p>In 2006, Brookhaven College began a partnership with the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District to offer an Early College High School program, which admits a limited number of <a>ninth-grade</a> students to an on-site high school program that allows them to begin their college studies during their <a>eleventh-grade</a> year and earn an associate's degree along with their high school diplomas.
This program is in addition to the existing <a>dual-credit</a> program that allows select secondary-school students to enroll in college courses at no cost while continuing at their original high-school campuses.</p>
<p>The college also houses the Head Start Center, which provides child care services for low-income families.
The Center also serves as a learning tool for students in the Child Development program.</p>
<p>The Students 55+ program offers non-credit, enrichment courses for adults 55 and older.</p>
<p>Senior adults, those 65 and older, who live in or own property in Dallas Country, can enroll in up to six hours of credit courses each semester or summer session at no cost, based on availability.</p>
