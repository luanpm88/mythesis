Originally called the Iowa Conference Seminary, the school was founded in 1853 by Reverend Samuel M. Fellows.
Four years later, in 1857, the name was changed to Cornell College, in honor of iron tycoon William Wesley Cornell, who was a distant relative of <a>Ezra Cornell</a> (founder of <a>Cornell University</a> in <a>Ithaca, New York</a>).
Cornell College also has the top 16th theater program in the country.</p>
Since 1978, school years have been divided into nine &quot;blocks&quot; of three-and-a-half weeks each (usually followed by a four-day &quot;block break&quot; to round out to four weeks), during which students are enrolled in a single class; what would normally be covered in a full semester's worth of class at a typical university is covered in just seventeen-and-one-half Cornell class days.
<a>Colorado College</a> in <a>Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>; <a>Quest University</a> in Squamish, British Columbia; <a>Tusculum College</a> in <a>Tusculum, Tennessee</a>;and <a>The University of Montana - Western</a> are the only other colleges operating under this academic calendar.</p>
In 1858, Cornell was host to Iowa's first female recipient of a baccalaureate degree,  Mary Fellows, a member of the first graduating class from Cornell College.
She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics.
In 1871, Harriette J. Cooke became the first female college professor in the United States to become a full professor with a salary equal to that of her male colleagues.</p>
