<p><strong>Jared Sparks</strong> (May 10, 1789 &ndash; March 14, 1866) was an <a>American</a> <a>historian</a>, educator, and <a>Unitarian</a> minister.
He served as <a>President</a> of <a>Harvard University</a> from 1849 to 1853.</p>
<p>Born in <a>Willington, Connecticut</a>, Sparks studied in the <a>common school</a>s, worked for a time at the carpenter's trade, and then became a schoolteacher.
He graduated from <a>Harvard University</a> (<a>A.B.</a>, 1815 and <a>A.M.</a>, 1818); in 1812 served as a tutor to the children of a family in Havre de Grace, Maryland, taught in a private school at <a>Lancaster, Massachusetts</a>, in 1815&#x2013;1817; and studied <a>theology</a> and was college tutor in <a>mathematics</a> and <a>natural philosophy</a> at Harvard in 1817&#x2013;1819.
In 1817&#x2013;1818 he was acting editor of the <em><a>North American Review</a></em>.
[[File:Jared Sparks Thomas Sully.jpeg|thumb|left|<em> Jared Sparks</em>, [[Thomas Sully]], 1831]] He was pastor of the First Independent Church (Unitarian) of <a>Baltimore, Maryland</a>, from 1819 to 1823, Dr <a>William Ellery Channing</a> delivering at his ordination his famous discourse on Unitarian Christianity.
During this period Sparks founded the <em>Unitarian Miscellany</em> and <em>Christian Monitor</em> (1821), a monthly, and edited its first three volumes; he was chaplain of the <a>United States House of Representatives</a> from 1821 to 1823; and he contributed to the <em>National Intelligencer</em> and other periodicals.</p>
<p>In 1823 his health failed and he withdrew from the ministry.
He founded and edited, in 1830 the <em>American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge</em>, which was continued by others and long remained a popular annual.</p>
<p>After extensive researches at home and (1828-1829) in <a>London</a> and <a>Paris</a>, he published the <em>Life and Writings of <a>George Washington</a></em> (12 vols., 1834-1837; redated 1842), his most important work; and in 1839 he published separately the <em>Life of George Washington</em> (abridged, 2 vols., 1842).
The work was for the most part favorably received, but Sparks was severely criticized by <a>Lord Mahon</a> (in the sixth volume of his <em>History of England</em>) and others for altering the text of some of Washington's writings.
Sparks defended his methods in <em>A Reply to the Strictures of Lord Mahon and Others</em> (1852).
In the history of the <a>American War of Independence</a>, Sparks discovered in the French archives the red-line map, which, in 1842, came into international prominence in connection with the dispute over the <a>north-eastern boundary</a> of the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>Sparks was one of the American intellectuals who received <a>Alexis de Tocqueville</a> during his 1831&#x2013;32 visit to the United States.
<p>In 1842, Sparks delivered twelve lectures on American history before the <a>Lowell Institute</a> in Boston.
In 1839-1849 he was McLean professor of ancient and modern history at Harvard.
His appointment to this position, says his biographer, was the first academic encouragement of American history, and of original historical research in the American field.
In 1849, he succeeded <a>Edward Everett</a> as president of Harvard.
He retired in 1853 on account of failing health, and devoted the rest of his life to his private studies.
For several years he was a member of the Massachusetts board of education.

His valuable collection of manuscripts and papers went to Harvard; and his private library and his maps were bought by <a>Cornell University</a>.
He was a pioneer in collecting, on a large scale, documentary material on American history, and in this and in other ways rendered valuable services to historical scholarship in the United States.</p>
