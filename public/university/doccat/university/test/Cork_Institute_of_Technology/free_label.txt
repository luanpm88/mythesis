<p>The main Institute research activity is primarily, though not exclusively, organised around three Strategic Research Clusters that reflect the CIT current dominant strategic research strengths and critical mass.
NIMBUS is CIT&#x2019;s first dedicated research centre and is intended not only to be a showcase for CIT&#x2019;s research but also to demonstrate CIT&#x2019;s ability to translate innovative research into economic benefit.
While it is not an official requirement, teams comprising members from differing disciplinary backgrounds are encouraged.</p>
<p>CIT&#x2019;s excellently prepared sports grounds play host to numerous competitions throughout the year, including schools matches in gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby.

<p>Other sports offered by the college include martial arts such as aikido, judo, karate, kickboxing and taekwondo.
