<p> <strong>Cork Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>CIT</strong>), formerly the Regional Technical College, Cork, is an Institute of Technology in Ireland, located in <a>Cork</a>, <a>Ireland</a> opened in 1973.
<p>The institute has been named as Institute of Technology of the Year in The Sunday Times University Guide for Ireland on numerous occasions, an accolade which it currently holds.</p>
<p>In 2007 the title of the head of the institute changed from &quot;Director&quot; to &quot;President&quot;.
In March 2008 it was announced that the Institute was applying for university status.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cork Institute of Technology, and its predecessor Cork RTC developed from earlier institutions such as the <a>Royal Cork Institution</a> which existed from 1807 until 1861, and the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute which was founded in 1912, which trained students in Science and Engineering.
Cork Regional Technical College was established in 1973 and the Crawford Institute was merged with the new Cork RTC in 1976.</p>
<p>Following enactment of the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, it incorporated the Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design on 1 January 1993.</p>
It is comprehensively equipped with theatres, lecture rooms, laboratories, drawing studios, a library, computer suites, open access computing centre and research units.
This is underlined by the fact that, after <a>Dublin Institute of Technology</a>, CIT has the most extensive delegated authority to award PhDs.
The CIT Research mission is to continue to build on niche strengths and to develop sustainable and productive research, innovation, technology transfer and postgraduate education across all its faculties.</p>
<p>On 17 January 2010, CIT formally took possession of the new NIMBUS Centre for Embedded Systems Research and, on 16 March, 65 researchers and students relocated from diverse locations in CIT to the NIMBUS building.</p>
<p>Funded through the HEA Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) in 2007, NIMBUS is the first building nationally to be completed in the 4th cycle of PRTLI funding and reflects very successful collaboration and project management by the CIT Development Office, the architects RKD, building contractors Walls and the team of researchers for whom the building was designed.
In a time of financial constraint, it also reflects well on the team that the project was completed on time and within budget.</p>
The integration of the Technologies for Embedded Computing (TEC) Centre (funded by Enterprise Ireland under the Applied Research Enhancement (ARE) programme) with NIMBUS further reflects this determination.
This strategy aligns closely with the recommendations of the recently published report from the Task Force on Innovation which call for a much greater emphasis on ensuring that research feeds through to tangible benefits to industry and on producing graduates who can contribute directly to Ireland&#x2019;s fast-growing knowledge economy.
In this context, NIMBUS is currently training 32 postgraduate researchers and NIMBUS staff is actively involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching in the Department of Electronic Engineering in CIT.</p>
<p>NIMBUS is among the most heavily networked buildings in the country with high data rate wired and wireless network points throughout the building and a suite of communications antennae on the roof of the centre facilitate long distance wireless networking.
A large area of the ground floor is given over to an open-plan laboratory space which will contain facilities for electronics prototyping and testing, RF/microwave testing and reliability testing.
<p>The <a>Collaborative European Research Conference</a> (CERC) is a prestigious annual event that invites postgraduate students to submit papers and participate in a peer-reviewed event.
CIT will host the 2011 CERC, scheduled to take place on the 14th and 15 January.</p>
<p>CIT holds a partnership with the <a>Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences</a> (h_da), Germany, one of Europe's most respected institutes in the fields of computer science and engineering.
CIT's BA in Multimedia offers a joint accreditation from CIT and h_da.</p>
<p>CIT offer a number of degree courses in conjunction with <a>University College Cork</a>, including their BSc in Architecture and BSc in Biomedical Science.</p>
<p>The CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory runs a programme in partnership with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California.
<p>CIT has also established various industrial alliances, particularly with the <a>EMC Corporation</a> and <a>VMware</a>, both of which have a business presence in Cork.
The college also maintains close ties with to <a>Cisco Systems</a> and the <a>Cisco Networking Academy</a>.
In 2007 a second incubation facility was opened to accommodate the demand for on-campus incubation space.
An extension to the existing building is currently taking place &amp; it is hoped this will be fully operation by June 2010, increasing total incubation space to 2,100 square metres.
<p>Since opening its doors in January 2006, the Rubicon Centre has quickly positioned itself as a catalyst, assisting entrepreneurs to take their projects to the next stage.
The Centre aims to stimulate an environment of creativity and innovation with a continual focus of nurturing the growth of knowledge based business and commercial research in the South West Region.
The Centre has attracted interest from both Irish and Overseas Companies operating in the Technology market.</p>
It has been in operation since 1998.
The focus of the Genesis Programme is to provide a package of supports to entrepreneurs in the South West Region in accelerating the development of their business.</p>
<p>Businesses from diverse sectors have participated on the programme in the past including Food, Information Technology, Biotech, Telecommunications, Renewable Energy, Medical Device and Automotive.
By developing the entrepreneurial skills of the participants and helping them realise the full potential of their businesses, the risk involved in setting up a business is reduced and the focus is on the development of scalable, high growth businesses.</p>
2010 also saw the presentation of an award for Best Innovation in an Emerging Space, the first time that this accolade was on offer at the event.</p>
In 2010, a total prize fund of &#x20ac;10,000 was allocated by the Cork Enterprise Board.
The Cork Enterprise Board endeavors to foster an entrepreneurial environment whereby more and more people will consider self employment as a career option.
<p>CIT boasts state of the art sporting facilities.
The college's primary <a>hurling</a> and <a>Gaelic football</a> pitch, located on campus, offers its own stadium.
CIT's athletics track is now one of the finest in the country, and also enjoys its own purpose-built stadium.
CIT offers students free membership to its small, but fully equipped, gym and weights room.
LeisureWorld, one of Cork's premier fitness and health facilities, is adjacent the campus, and offers special membership rates to CIT students and staff.
<p>In 2009 CIT won the <a>Sigerson Cup</a>, the premier Gaelic football competition in Ireland for the first time, beating <a>Dublin Institute of Technology</a> by 5 points in the final.
CIT enjoys a local rivalry with <a>University College Cork</a>.</p>
<p>To underline its commitment to sport, CIT annually awards sports bursaries to a wide range of sports for both senior and first-year students.
It is expected that those awarded the bursaries will have high levels of achievement in their chosen sport and a full involvement and participation in this sport in the Institute.</p>
The Office facilitates students and their clubs and is responsible for the management and upkeep of all sports facilities in the Institute.
CIT also has a dedicated GAA Development Officer, a position that is currently held by Keith Ricken.</p>
<p>CIT has a number of constituent colleges and facilities located off of its main campus, such as the CIT Cork School of Music, CIT Crawford College of Art and Design, National Maritime College of Ireland and CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.</p>
The college was founded in 1878 and  became a school of Cork Institute of Technology in 1993.
The school currently operates from a five-floor music centre designed by Murray O&#x2019;Laoire and <a>Buro Happold</a>.
The building was opened in 2007.
<p>Cork School of Music currently operates from a state-of-the-art building on Union Quay in Cork, hosting a large number of Steinway pianos.
While the building hosts a full recording suite, it also contains six lecture theaters, the full Fleischmann Library, 2 audio labs, an I.T. lab, over 50 tutoring suites, 5 medium sized classrooms, 5 full sized classrooms each acoustically isolated to also act as practice rooms.
Each room in the building is equipped with at least one Apple iMac, projector and a speaker system, Sennheiser Evolution radio microphone, Rane rack mixer and dual 15 band graphic EQ, and a Lab Gruppen stereo power amplifer.
The school is equipped with audio technology that makes it easy for tutors to teach students, with at least one <a>Steinway</a> piano in every room, if not two (to facilitate one on one tutoring and preventing the need to use one piano for two).
The school also hosts two harpsichords constructed in 2007 by the harpsichord-maker Michael Johnson, as well as housing the 1999 Michael Johnson instrument owned by Cork County Council.
<p>The old CSM building, on Union Quay, was demolished in September 2005.</p>
<h3>CIT Crawford College of Art and Design</h3>
<p>The CIT Crawford College of Art &amp; Design is a constituent college of Cork Institute of Technology, providing education in the arts for over 200 years.
The CIT Crawford College offers full-time courses to Bachelors Degree, Masters and Higher Diploma levels, all validated by CIT and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC).
The college enjoys an excellent reputation for creative education, both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>The college is sited in its own campus in Sharman Crawford Street, approximately four miles from the main CIT campus in Bishopstown.
The Crawford College of Art &amp; Design is conveniently located near the primary art centres and schools in Cork, giving students access to the artistic and cultural stimulus they require.
CIT's Department of Media Communications became part of the Crawford College in January 2010.
The library houses over 12,000 volumes, 45 periodicals and newspapers, and over 30,000 slides.</p>
<p>The CIT Crawford College of Art and Design has its origins in the Cork School of Design of 1850, which was associated with the <a>Royal Cork Institution</a>.
The building that originally housed the college was built in 1724 as Cork&#x2019;s Custom House.
In 1979 the college was transferred to its current location on Sharman Crawford Street, near Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral.
The Crawford College of Art and Design has close ties to the Crawford Art Gallery, which is located in the college's former building.
The Crawford Art Gallery today possesses famous Canova Casts, and also houses John Butt's View of Cork, which was painted circa 1755, and shows the influence of Dutch trade on the early architecture of Cork.</p>
<p>Irish landscape painter James Brennan (RHA) was headmaster of the school from 1860 to 1889.
It was he who influenced William Horatio Crawford, from the famous brewing family, to invest in the School, leading to the 1884 extension and subsequent renaming of the school to the Crawford Municipal School of Art.
Under the Institutes of Technology Act 2006, the Crawford College of Art and Design became a designated school of the Cork Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI) is a joint project between the Cork Institute of Technology and the <a>Irish Naval Service</a>.
<p>The college cost approximately &#x20ac;50 million when opened in October 2004 and is one of the first <a>public private partnership</a> type projects in <a>education in the Republic of Ireland</a>, and will result in a 25 year contract held by Focus Education Ltd.</p>
Engine department trainees avail of a fully functional engine room, which includes diesel engines, oil purifiers, air compressors, sewage treatment plant, fresh water generators and other equipment found on board ocean going vessels.
An engine room simulator is used to train personnel in watchkeeping, teamwork and process management.
Common facilities include the survival training pool, helicopter dunker, lifeboats and firefighting training facility.
<p>In September 2006, <a>King Harald</a> and <a>Queen Sonja of Norway</a> visited the NMCI, while on a state visit to Ireland, to promote maritime links between <a>Cork</a> and <a>Oslo</a>.</p>
<p>Blackrock Castle was originally built on the <a>River Lee</a> in 1582 by the citizens of Cork as a watch tower and fort, assuring trade ships of a safe haven, the Elizabethan government of the era ordering a round tower constructed to protect against marauding pirates and other invaders.
Following a charter by James I in 1608, Blackrock Castle was handed over to the City of Cork.
In 1722 the old tower was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt with an octagonal room topped with a cupola.
The castle was used at this time as the Corporation banquet hall.
In 1827 the castle was again destroyed by fire, before being rebuilt a year later, three additional storeys and out-buildings being added at that time.
In 2002 the castle underwent an extensive refurbishment programme, and in August 2007, Blackrock Castle was re-opened to the public as the state-of-the-art CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.</p>
<p><em>Cosmos at the Castle</em> is an award-winning interactive astronomy exhibit that takes place at the observatory, featuring four cinema sized screens that share information with visitors on the Big Bang, the evolution of life on Earth, and the existence of extraterrestrial life in the Universe.</p>
<p>The observatory also houses a team of astronomical researchers and scientists from CIT, most of which are engaged in the development of new technologies designed for searching for planets around distant stars, a project known as the Planet Search Programme.
Most the researchers come from the Astronomy and Instrumentation Group, based within the Department of Applied Physics and Instrumentation at CIT. </p>
A monthly remote astronomy schools project is run at the observatory.
The project is entitled Web of Stars, and is run in conjunction with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California.
<p>CIT is the Irish partner in the Comenius funded European Union Hands on Universe project.
<p>The castle hosted the 2011 <a>Collaborative European Research Conference</a>.</p>
