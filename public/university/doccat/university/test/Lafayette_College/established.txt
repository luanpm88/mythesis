The school, founded in 1826 by citizens of Easton, first began holding classes in 1832.
The founders voted to name the school after <a>General Lafayette</a>, who <a>famously toured the country in 1824-25</a>, as &quot;a testimony of respect for [his] talents, virtues, and signal services...the great cause of freedom&quot;.
In its 2010 edition, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked Lafayette 35th out of all liberal arts colleges in the nation, while <em><a>Barron's</a></em> ranked it among the top 65 &quot;Most Competitive&quot; colleges and universities.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A group of Easton citizens led by <a>James Madison Porter</a> met on December 27, 1824 at White's Tavern to explore the possibility of opening a college.
<p>In 1857, <a>Francis March</a> became the first professor of <a>English</a> at an American college when Lafayette became the first college to implement the program of study.
It is available in both print and online form.</p>
<p>In 1970, the college increased total enrollment after changing from an all-male school to a coeducational institution.
Major festivities were held on September 6, 2007, Lafayette's birthday, and were kicked off the night before with a lecture by renowned historian <a>David McCullough</a>.</p>

For the class of 2012, the acceptance rate was 37%, with 75% of those accepted ranking in the top 10% of their high school classes.
The middle 50% of accepted students have <a>SAT</a> scores ranging from 600-700 Critical Reading and 640-730 Math, and <a>ACT</a> scores ranging from 27-32.
including the most <a>Goldwater Scholarship</a>s obtained by a liberal arts college over the past six years.
For the class of 2012, Lafayette gave financial aid to 66% of the students, with the average package amounting to $26,850 for all students.
The college also offers a merit-based academic scholarship - the Marquis Scholarship, which provides $16,000 per year.
<p>The College offers 45 different Majors across four academic divisions: natural sciences, humanities, engineering, and social sciences.
<p>The Policy Studies program, established in 2006, is an interdisciplinary major that allows students to better understand the design, management, and evaluation of policies and institutions.
Also new to the College is a Chinese language program which will offer classes on Chinese language and culture.
Lafayette's Strategic Planning Initiative is also considering the possibility of introducing additional non-European language programs over time, including Arabic, Hindi, and Swahili.</p>
<p>Starting in the 2006-2007 academic year, President Daniel Weiss agreed to boycott the controversial Peer Assessment in the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> rankings, which accounts for 25% of a school's overall ranking.
Lafayette and eleven other colleges, working with Lloyd Thacker of the <a>Education Conservancy</a>, created a petition calling for a boycott of the reputational survey as well as a refusal to use the rankings to promote a college or to indicate its quality.
63 college and university presidents have signed the letter.
Predictably, Lafayette College's ranking fell from #30 in 2007 to #34 in 2008.</p>
Pardee Hall, the largest academic building on campus, was devastated by fire twice in the 19th century.
One fire began when a science experiment was carelessly left in a lab drawer.
The other fire was arson, deliberately set by a professor of moral philosophy and ethics, who reportedly enjoyed watching the building burn from across the <a>Delaware River</a> in <a>Phillipsburg, New Jersey</a>.
Although Pardee Hall is truly oriented southward, with the gently sloping hill leading to its front entrance, the students refer to this as the &quot;back&quot; of Pardee because the other side (the true back) faces the Quad.
<p>Kirby Hall of Civil Rights, the interior of which is constructed of <a>travertine</a> marble, was rumored to have been the most expensive collegiate building, per square foot, built at its time.
The building was designed by the same architectural firm that designed <a>New York City</a>'s <a>Grand Central Terminal</a>.</p>
<p>Farinon College Center, the student union, was architecturally inspired by the McKelvy House, a college-owned mansion just off campus.
It is located in the original location of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and the fireplace in the lobby is the original fireplace from the fraternity.
While the top floor of Farinon is an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; style buffet paid for in blocks from a meal plan, the downstairs is a station-based food court in which students pay itemized fees for food.
<p>Markle Hall, now the main administrative building, housing the Offices of Admissions and Financial Aid, originally was designated the Hall of Mining Engineering.
An online historical survey of campus buildings is maintained by the College's Special Collections.</p>
<p>Gilbert's Cafe, a coffeehouse located on the ground floor of Kirby House, was opened in 1999 to provide a late-night hangout for students.
Its name was the subject of a contest, and the winning student selected one of General Lafayette's middle names: Gilbert.
In the fall of 2006, a sinkhole was discovered underneath Kirby House, and the much-beloved coffeehouse had to be closed during the spring semester.
<p>Also in the fall of 2006, Lafayette signed a deal with <a>MTV</a> to designate the campus as an MTVu campus.
As a result, Lafayette hosted an <a>MTVu</a> concert in the spring of 2006, as opposed to the regular concert chosen by the student government.
In the spring of 2007, <a>Third Eye Blind</a> was selected to perform in Kirby Gymnasium, followed by the musical artist <a>Ben Folds</a> in the spring of 2008 and a triple feature with headliner Girl Talk in 2009.
The men's basketball program also has a long history, peaking in the late nineties under the leadership of Fran O'Hanlon, who led the Leopards to back-to-back Patriot League championships and NCAA Tournament appearances in 1999 and 2000.
These seasons were documented by <a>John Feinstein</a> in his book, <em><a>The Last Amateurs</a></em>.</p>

<p>Lafayette College's athletic program is notable for <a>The Rivalry</a> with nearby <a>Lehigh University</a>.
Since 1884, the two football teams have met 146 times, making it the most played rivalry in the history of college football.
It is also the longest running rivalry in college football, with the teams playing at least once every year since 1897.
Members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year.</p>
<p><a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> National Service Fraternity was founded in 1925 at Lafayette College by <a>Frank Reed Horton</a> in Hogg Hall (formerly Brainerd Hall) still exists and continue what Frank Reed Horton was started.</p>
<p>The Rho Chapter of the <a>Delta Kappa Epsilon</a> fraternity is the oldest fraternity and the oldest student organization at Lafayette College, having been chartered on October 15, 1855.
<p>The <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a> fraternity house was in <em><a>Guinness World Records</a></em> for a number of years as the largest free standing structure to undergo transportation.
<p>The club was founded in 2003 and is a member of EWB-USA.
The club is linked with rural villages in the <a>Yoro</a> region of <a>Honduras</a>.
EWB's mission is to design and implement projects in these villages that help promote better life.
The club has focused its efforts on water treatment systems.</p>
<p>El Convento, which is located in the Yoro district of central Honduras, will be the third sustainable water project EWB-LC students have worked on in the country since 2003 when the club was founded.
The group has implemented gravity-fed water systems in neighboring Lagunitas and La Fortuna.
In La Fortuna, the group utilized a <a>slow sand filter</a> in its system.
<p>The campus radio station, <a>WJRH</a> 104.9FM, first established licensure with the <a>Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) in 1946, broadcasting under a Class D educational license on 90.5 FM.
As <a>FM</a> frequencies grew in demand, the FCC mandated that stations operating in the frequency range currently provided to WJRH increase their power to serve larger audiences.
Since WJRH was only to serve the Lafayette community, it was decided to give the frequency to another facility and relocate to its current home frequency, 104.9.</p>
Several additions have included the relaunch of WJRH Broadband (a live <a>Windows Media Player</a> stream available to Lafayette students) and <em>WJRH PC</em> (an online database of MP3 <a>Podcasts</a> of select shows as part of an overall website renovation).
<p> <a>right|thumb|William E. Simon, class of 1952, served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1974-1977.</a>
Lafayette has produced many prominent businessmen, engineers, politicians, and other notable individuals including <a>James McKeen Cattell</a>, the first psychology professor, Vineyard Vines founder Ian Murray, and Secretary of the Treasury <a>William E. Simon</a>.
David K. McDonogh, of the Class of 1844, is argued by the College to be the first &quot;legalized&quot; slave ever to receive a college degree.
In addition, the founders of the 1960s <a>pop</a> group <a>The Cyrkle</a>, guitarists Don Danneman and Tom Dawes, were graduates of Lafayette.
<a>Leonard Jeffries</a>, a professor at CCNY, was president of a traditionally Jewish fraternity while he was a student at Lafayette College.
