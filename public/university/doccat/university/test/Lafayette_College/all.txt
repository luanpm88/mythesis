established$$$@@@%%%Pardee Hall, the largest academic building on campus, was devastated by fire twice in the 19th century.
established$$$@@@%%%One fire began when a science experiment was carelessly left in a lab drawer.
established$$$@@@%%%The other fire was arson, deliberately set by a professor of moral philosophy and ethics, who reportedly enjoyed watching the building burn from across the <a>Delaware River</a> in <a>Phillipsburg, New Jersey</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Although Pardee Hall is truly oriented southward, with the gently sloping hill leading to its front entrance, the students refer to this as the &quot;back&quot; of Pardee because the other side (the true back) faces the Quad.
image_size$$$@@@%%%During the winter, or after a drenching spring rain, sledding is popular on the hill &quot;behind&quot; Pardee Hall.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Kirby Hall of Civil Rights, the interior of which is constructed of <a>travertine</a> marble, was rumored to have been the most expensive collegiate building, per square foot, built at its time.
