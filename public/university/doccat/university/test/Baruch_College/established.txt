<p><strong>Bernard M. Baruch College</strong>, known more commonly as <strong>Baruch College</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> and one of the constituent colleges of the <a>City University of New York</a> (CUNY) system.
The college is situated on <a>Lexington Avenue</a> near the <a>Flatiron</a>/<a>Gramercy Park</a> district of <a>Manhattan</a>, <a>New York City</a>.
Baruch is one of CUNY's flagship and senior colleges, and traces its roots back to the founding of the Free Academy, the first institution of free public higher education in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>The school has a diverse student body; its students hail from more than 160 countries.
Baruch is particularly noted for its <a>Zicklin School of Business</a>, the largest collegiate school of business in the United States, named after financier <a>Larry Zicklin</a> and his wife.
<p>The <a>New York State</a> Literature Fund was created to serve students who could not afford to enroll in New York City&#x2019;s private colleges.
The Literature Fund led to the creation of the Committee of the Board of Education of the City of New York, led by <a>Townsend Harris</a>, J.S. Bosworth, and John L. Mason.
<p>The Free Academy became the College of the City of New York, now <a>The City College of New York</a>.
In 1919, what would become Baruch College was established as City College School of Business and Civic Administration.
On December 15, 1928, the cornerstone was laid on the new building which would house the newly founded school.
At the time it opened it was considered the biggest such school for the teaching of business education in the United States.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, women were allowed into the School of Business.
The total enrollment at The City College of New York reached an all-time high of 40,000 students in 1935, and the School of Business had an enrollment of more than 1,700 students in the day session alone.
The School of Business was renamed the Baruch School in 1958 in honor of alumnus <a>Bernard Baruch</a>, a statesman and financier.
In 1961, the New York State Education Law established the City University of New York (CUNY) system and, in 1968, Baruch College became a senior college in the City University system.</p>
<p>In the CUNY years, Baruch grew drastically and for a time, CUNY considered relocating the college to <a>Harlem</a> to allow for expansion.
The idea was later dropped, and the college acquired property on East 24th Street in Manhattan to expand its campus.
The first president of the new college (1969&#x2013;1970) was the previous federal <a>Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</a> <a>Robert C. Weaver</a>.
He was succeeded by economist Joel Edwin Segall in 1977.
Current CUNY <a>Chancellor</a> <a>Matthew Goldstein</a> was president of the school from 1991 to 1998.
He was responsible for raising admissions requirements and creating the School of Public Affairs in 1994.
<a>Edward Regan</a>, former <a>comptroller</a> of New York state, served as president from 2000 to 2004.
In 2001, the Vertical Campus opened and Baruch accepted its first students from the CUNY Honors College, now known as the <a>Macaulay Honors College</a>.
<p><a>Kathleen Waldron</a> was appointed president in 2004.
Under her leadership, the quality of students continued to rise and faculty hiring accelerated.
Baruch also received an unprecedented number of donations from alumni and the Vertical Campus, 23rd Street building, and Performing Arts complex were renamed in honor of the three largest donors, respectively.
Alumni giving has increased under &quot;Baruch Means Business&quot;, a $150 million capital campaign.
<p>On February 22, 2010, Dr. <a>Mitchel Wallerstein</a>, Dean of the <a>Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a> at <a>Syracuse University</a>, was appointed as the next President of Baruch College.
<h3>Presidents of Baruch College</h3>
Bernard Baruch made his fortune in the stock market in his 30s but incidentally changed his course when he made his first million.</p>
<p>He stated, &quot;I could not forget my father&#x2019;s look the day I proudly informed him I was worth a million dollars.
The kindly, quizzical expression told me, more clearly than words, that in his opinion, money making was a secondary matter&#x2026; Of what use to a man are millions of dollars unless he does something worthwhile with them&#x201d;</p>
He coined the term &quot;<a>Cold War</a>&quot; in 1947 to describe relations between the United States and the Soviet Union from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&#x201c;During my eighty-seven years, I have witnessed a whole succession of technological revolutions.

<p>The landmarked Free Academy building (17 Lexington Avenue) is still in use by the college today.
The building is now named the Lawrence and Eris Field Building and is often referred to as the &#x201c;23rd Street Building,&#x201d; because of its location on East 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue.
In 1998, after decades of renting space for classrooms, Baruch began construction of what would later be called the Newman Vertical Campus (the VC), named after businessman William Newman.
East 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues was renamed &#x201c;Bernard Baruch Way,&#x201d; and the college now uses the Vertical Campus (One Bernard Baruch Way) as its official address.</p>
<p>In 2004, a proposal was made to integrate the Vertical Campus with the 23rd Street Building.
<p>The Information and Technology Building, opened in 1994, is located across East 25th Street from Newman Vertical Campus.
A 320 seat computer lab, known as the Baruch Computing and Technology Center (BCTC) can be found on the sixth floor.
The building also contains the offices of the <a>Registrar</a>, Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid and the International Student Center.</p>
<p>In 2009, the East 25th Street entrance of the William and Anita Newman Vertical Campus served as the entrance fa&#x00e7;ade of the hospital at which Nurse Jackie and her colleagues worked in the Showtime drama <a>Nurse Jackie</a>.</p>
