<h4>Music Education</h4>
Vocal Music Education students are required to teach in the elementary classroom of the University's Magnet School and to run rehearsals with a high school choir under the direction of Dr. Stuart Younse at nearby Simsbury High School.
Music Education at Hartt boasts 100% job placement every year and has the student in a real classroom starting in their first year of study.</p>
The senior Actor Training majors are cast in Hartford Stage Company's annual production of A Christmas Carol and the senior Music Theatre majors are cast in Goodspeed's annual New Works Festival.</p>
Occasionally, the Camerata combines with other choirs to perform major choral works.</p>
<p>The Hartt Touring Choir SATB with 40 to 45 voices has performed several international tours, traveling to Spain, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany.</p>
<h4>Alfred C Fuller Music Center</h4>
The Fuller Building is the primary home to classes and administrative offices as well as the Hartt Community Division (excluding dance).
The Fuller Music Center has two major performance spaces: Millard Auditorium and Berkman Recital Hall.
In the summer of 2008, Berkman Recital Hall, in the Fuller Music Center, underwent a complete renovation, turning a former recital hall/black box theater/dance rehearsal space into a dedicated 80-seat recital hall (although the hall is used for meetings, rehearsals, and other miscellaneous events).
The Handel Performing Arts Center (HPAC) is located off campus at the corner of Albany Avenue and Westbourne Parkway in Hartford.</p>
