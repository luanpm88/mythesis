Known primarily as a school for <a>jazz</a> and popular music, it also offers college-level courses in a wide range of contemporary and historic styles, including <a>hip hop</a>, <a>reggae</a>, <a>salsa</a>, <a>rock</a>, <a>heavy metal</a>, and <a>bluegrass</a>, in addition to its traditional jazz courses.
<p>As a college, Berklee College of Music is fully accredited by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> (NEASC).
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1945, pianist-composer-arranger and MIT graduate <a>Lawrence Berk</a>, founded Schillinger House, the precursor to the Berklee College of Music.
Located at 284 Newbury St. in Boston&#x2019;s Back Bay, the school specialized in the Schillinger System of harmony and composition.
Instrumental lessons and a few classes in traditional theory, harmony, and arranging were also offered.
In 1954, when the school&#x2019;s curriculum had expanded to include music education classes and more traditional music theory, Berk changed the name to Berklee School of Music, after his son <a>Lee Eliot Berk</a>, to reflect the broader scope of instruction.</p>
<p>Lawrence Berk placed great emphasis on learning from practitioners, as opposed to academics, and generally hired working musicians as faculty members.
Drummer <a>Alan Dawson</a> and saxophonist <a>Charlie Mariano</a> became faculty members in 1957.
Reed player <a>John LaPorta</a> began teaching in 1962.
<p>Another trend in the school&#x2019;s history also began the mid-&#x2019;50s.
For example, Japanese pianist <a>Toshiko Akiyoshi</a>, arrived in 1956.
Multiple Grammy-winning producer <a>Arif Mardin</a> came from Turkey to study at the school in 1958.
<p>In 1957, Berklee initiated the first of many innovative applications of technology to music education with Jazz in the Classroom, a series of LP recordings of student work, accompanied by scores.
These albums contain early examples of composing, arranging, and performing by students who went on to prominent jazz careers such as <a>Gary Burton</a>, <a>John Abercrombie</a>, <a>John Scofield</a>, <a>Ernie Watts</a>, <a>Alan Broadbent</a>, <a>Sadao Watanabe</a>, and many others.
<p>Berklee awarded its first bachelor of music degrees in 1966.
During the 1960s, the Berklee curriculum began to reflect new developments in popular music, such the rise of rock and roll, soul and funk, and jazz-rock fusion.
<p>The school became Berklee College of Music in 1970 and bestowed its first honorary doctorate on <a>Duke Ellington</a> in 1971.
Vibraphonist <a>Gary Burton</a> joined faculty in 1971, helping to solidify the place of jazz-rock fusion in the curriculum.
As Dean of Curriculum from 1985 to 1996, Burton led the development of several new majors, including music synthesis and songwriting, and facilitated the school&#x2019;s transition to technology-based education.
Curriculum innovations during the 1970s included the first college-level instrumental major in electric bass guitar in 1973., and the first jazz-rock ensemble class in 1974.
The board of trustees elected his son, <a>Lee Eliot Berk</a>, to replace him.
<p>Under the leadership of <a>Lee Eliot Berk</a>, the school underwent further growth and diversification of its curriculum.
In 1986, the world&#x2019;s first college-level major in music synthesis was offered, followed by the world&#x2019;s first college songwriting major in 1987.
<p>Berklee expanded its community outreach efforts in 1991 with the launch of City Music, a program designed to make music instruction available to underserved youth in the Boston area.
On a more global scale, Berklee partnered with selected music schools around the world to form the Berklee International Network in 1993.
In 2002, the school began offering classes online through Berkleemusic.com.
Other curriculum developments included the incorporation of a hip-hop course in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2004, <a>Lee Eliot Berk</a> stepped down as president of the school his father had founded and <a>Roger H. Brown</a> was installed as the college&#x2019;s third president.
Under Brown&#x2019;s leadership the college's enrollment has grown and diversified while further expansion of the school&#x2019;s academic offerings have continued.
In 2006, mandolin and banjo were accepted as principal instruments for the first time.
Beginning in 1972 an era of more rapid expansion began with the purchase of the Fenway Theater and the adjoining Sherry Biltmore Hotel at 150 Massachusetts Avenue.
The theater was renovated and opened as the 1,227-seat <a>Berklee Performance Center</a> in 1976.
It also houses the library, which was renamed the Stan Getz Library and Media Center in 1998.
The 150 Massachusetts Avenue building is also the site of the Berklee Learning Center, which when it opened in 1993, was the world&#x2019;s largest networked computer learning facility for music education.
<p>The Genko Uchida Center at 921 Boylston Street opened in 1997 and houses the offices for enrollment, admissions, scholarships and student employment, the registrar, financial aid, bursar, rehearsal and classroom space, and the 200-seat David Friend Recital Hall.
<p>As of 2010, Berklee occupies 21 buildings primarily in the Back Bay area of Boston, near the intersection of Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue.
A new Liberal Arts building at 7 Haviland Street was dedicated in 2010.
Students may combine many of Berklee's 12 majors, depending on the nature of the program, in order to broaden their course of study, pursue diverse interests, and prepare for a career.
The dual major program requires a five-year course of study and is available to both degree and diploma candidates.
<p>The first recording facility at Berklee was a two-track studio in the basement of Berklee&#x2019;s main building, 1140 Boylston Street.
Joe Hostetter offered the first elective course in Audio Recording in 1972.
With the encouragement of producer Arif Mardin, the college built its first 8-track studio in 1974.
In 1977 the Department of Audio Recording was formed, with Hostetter as its first Chair.
The program has continued to expand its facilities, with 13 studios in operation in 2009.
<p>In 1985, the Society of Professional Audio Recording Services (SPARS) voted the Department best in the category of Outstanding Institutional Achievement in a Recording Program.
<em>Mix</em> magazine presented MP&amp;E with a TEC (Technical Excellence and Creativity) award in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1992.
<p>Alumni of the Berklee MP&amp;E Department garnered more than 40 Grammies (including 20 Latin Grammies), three Oscars, and four Emmy Awards between 1992 and 2009.</p>
<p>The student majoring in jazz composition will develop the creative application of the basic musical elements of melody, harmony, and rhythm in the contexts and practices associated with jazz music.
<p>Through the study of acknowledged masters of jazz composition, as well as by attendance at clinics and concerts, the student will develop aesthetic vision and the critical ability to recognize and discuss quality elements in jazz composition.
<p>The jazz composition major will develop sufficient skills to pursue a professional career as a jazz writer, working among colleagues in one of the many cooperative groups dedicated to the production and performance of new music, contributing to the repertoire of established jazz artists as composer and/or arranger, or to gain entry to graduate programs in jazz studies in preparation for a career as an instructor and scholar in the field of jazz theory, composition, and improvisation.</p>
It has the highest percentage of graduates of the college working full time in the music industry.</p>
They were the first college-level courses to emphasize mainstream and popular music applications of the technology, as opposed to art music.
The college&#x2019;s first electronic music facility included ARP and <a>ARP Odyssey</a> monophonic synthesizers, and early student projects were realized on tape, using two-track recorders to capture music created from electronically manipulated basic waveforms.
As interest in electronic music grew and technology steadily improved, an Electronic Music Major was offered in 1980.
Once sampling technology began to appear and all synthesizer manufacturers adopted the <a>MIDI</a> standard in 1983, course expansion in these areas increased.
The curriculum today emphasizes the technology, collaborative, and business skills that composers need in scoring for visual media, including film, video, and video games.
The first course in the principles of dramatic program music, which covered radio in addition to film, was offered at Berklee in 1959.
Between 1969 and 1972, Kendall Capps directed an expansion of the curriculum.
His successor, Steven Gould, established the school&#x2019;s first dedicated film-scoring lab.
Beginning in 1975, under the leadership of Don Wilkins, the department continued to upgrade its technology and offered a wider range of courses.
Department Chair Wilkins, along with assistant chair Michael Rendich, oversaw the curriculum transition into the use of new synthesizer and MIDI technologies.
Under his leadership, the college offered its first video game scoring course in 2008.
The Video Game Scoring minor was first offered in 2010.</p>
The student will demonstrate mastery of these skills and concepts as well as the development of an individual compositional personality and voice, by completing a portfolio of scores that will include (but not be limited to) a number of pieces in smaller forms, a tonal four-part fugue, a composition for solo voice or mixed chorus, a sonata in three movements, and a composition for full orchestra.</p>
<p>The study of acknowledged masterpieces from different historical periods will develop in the student an individual aesthetic vision and the critical ability to recognize and discuss music of quality.
<p>The composition major will develop sufficient skills and knowledge to function as a composer of concert music and to gain entry to a graduate program in music theory or composition in order to pursue a career as a teacher, scholar, and practitioner of music theory and composition.</p>
<p>The student majoring in songwriting will develop skills in melody, harmony, and arranging as well as creative approaches to musical composition, lyric writing, and an individual writing style.
Students interested in becoming singer/songwriters will choose a curriculum that focuses on both songwriting and performance, culminating in a portfolio of their original songs.
The portfolio will include lead sheets, lyric sheets, and demonstration recordings of each of the songs, equivalent in production quality to those typically presented to music publishers, record producers, and record companies by professional songwriters.</p>
<p>Through the study of acknowledged masterpieces of the songwriter's art, the student will develop the critical skills necessary to recognize and discuss quality elements in musical and lyrical structure.
Interpersonal and situational skills will develop through the many collaborative situations that exist in the professional environment, cowriting songs both as composer and as lyricist, working with vocalists and instrumentalists in the production of demo recordings, and working with engineers, artists, and producers in the studio environment.</p>
<p>The student majoring in contemporary writing and production will study composition, arranging, scoring, and production techniques and approaches, and will be able to apply those skills and concepts by writing for and overseeing the production of a wide variety of instrumental, vocal, acoustic, and electronic combinations, ranging from small workshop groups to a studio orchestra in live performance situations and recording studio environments.
The student will explore contemporary concepts and techniques of arranging and sound production in both the analog and digital domains and will gain valuable experience by being able to create, arrange, and produce projects using MIDI workstations and the Berklee recording studios.
A final project, either an industry internship, participation in one of the college&#x2019;s ongoing model music industry projects, or both, is also required.
A joint MBA is offered through the Suffolk University Accelerated MBA program.</p>
<p>MBM majors have a choice of several model music industry projects to participate in.
They help manage all aspects of Heavy Rotation Records, a student-run enterprise established by the college in 1995, and Jazz Revelations Records, founded in 2004.
Students enrolled in MBM courses also play leadership rolls in the Berklee International Radio Network, a four channel online radio network that began broadcasting in 2007.
These courses laid the groundwork for the creation of a full-fledged major in 1992 under founding department chair Don Gorder.&lt;ref
<p>The student majoring in music education will develop skills, concepts, and methodologies in the following areas: music, including music theory and composition, musicianship, history, arranging, orchestration, improvisation, and conducting; teaching with technology; solo performance techniques acquired through private instrumental or vocal study; vocal and instrumental techniques, pedagogy, and literature related to solo and ensemble performance; and the relationship of music to other fields of knowledge.
<p>The field of music education is a constantly changing one, and the student will develop sufficient content, and theoretical and pedagogical skills, to cope with and readily adapt to changes in the field due to discoveries of ongoing research in learning as well as social, economic, and cultural changes.</p>
These include a foundation in music theory, history, composition, arranging, keyboard, guitar, voice, improvisation, and conducting, as well as clinical skills including principles of therapy, exceptionality, and the therapeutic relationship.
