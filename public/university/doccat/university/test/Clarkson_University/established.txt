It was founded in 1896 and has an enrollment of about 3,000 students studying towards <a>bachelor</a>'s, <a>master</a>'s, and <a>doctoral</a> <a>degrees</a> in each of its three schools: the School of <a>Business</a>, School of <a>Arts</a> &amp; <a>Science</a>s, and the <a>Wallace H.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local entrepreneur who was accidentally killed while working in his <a>sandstone</a> <a>quarry</a> not far from Potsdam.
When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life.
Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sunstaining severe internal injuries.
The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of <a>townhouses</a> in <a>New York City</a> and elsewhere.
The school was called the <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology</em>.<a>thumb|300px|Old
<p>In 1913 the name was changed to <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology</em>, which was used in a shortened version as <em>Clarkson College of Technology</em> or <em>CCT</em>.
During the first half of the 20th century the majority of the campus was located &quot;downtown&quot;.
As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell, and Old Main for administrative functions.</p>
<p>On 24 February 1984 the school officially became <em>Clarkson University</em>, although the pep band's rallying cry at hockey games is still &quot;Let's Go Tech!&quot;.
The school and its hockey team have carried the nickname &quot;Tech&quot; since the 1896 founding.
&quot;CCT&quot; is still printed on older school property and equipment.</p>
<p>Much to the dismay of many alumni, the <a>State University of New York at Canton</a> (SUNY Canton) in neighboring <a>Canton</a> has informally adopted the moniker Canton College of Technology.</p>
<p><a>The Clarkson School</a>, a special division of Clarkson University, was founded in 1978 as a unique educational opportunity.
The School offers students an early entrance opportunity into college, replacing the typical senior year of high school with a year of college.
It is one of few college early admission programs in the country that provides a real community living/learning experience on a university campus.</p>
<p>The Clarkson School's Bridging Year is a &quot;<a>bridging year</a>&quot; between high school and college for students who are ready to enter college early.
They take classes with other University students and usually carry a course load of 15 to 18 credits per semester for two semesters.
Cross-registration at neighboring area colleges and universities can provide additional college credits, particularly in art, music and languages.
During the last 20 years Clarkson has developed almost exclusively on the hill campus.
The Department of Physical Therapy is located in the downtown campus.

<a>Wes Craven</a>, creator of the <a>A Nightmare on Elm Street</a> franchise, was a professor at Clarkson University in 1968, as well as faculty adviser to the Clarkson Drama Club (the predecessor of the current Clarkson Theatre Company).
As part of one of Professor Craven's classes, Humanities IV, several <a>Theta Chi</a> members wanted to make a spoof of traditional horror movies, about the strange occurrences in their fraternity's house at 18 Elm Street.
While none of those involved had very much film experience, they made the film for about $300 and it was shown twice on campus.
Much of Craven's inspiration for <em><a>A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></em> came from this first filmmaking experience; the house in the movie, while not the house used in the first version, resembles this house and also resides on Elm Street.
The town in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> is named Madstop, which is Potsdam backwards.</p>
