established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school was founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local entrepreneur who was accidentally killed while working in his <a>sandstone</a> <a>quarry</a> not far from Potsdam.
established$$$@@@%%%When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life.
established$$$@@@%%%Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sunstaining severe internal injuries.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%He died five days later.
established$$$@@@%%%The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of <a>townhouses</a> in <a>New York City</a> and elsewhere.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area.
established$$$@@@%%%The school was called the <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology</em>.<a>thumb|300px|Old
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Main, 2009</a> <a>thumb|300px|Old Snell Hall, 2009</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1913 the name was changed to <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology</em>, which was used in a shortened version as <em>Clarkson College of Technology</em> or <em>CCT</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%During the first half of the 20th century the majority of the campus was located &quot;downtown&quot;.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The campus slowly expanded to an area known as the &quot;Hill&quot;, located on the south-western edge of the village.
established$$$@@@%%%As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell, and Old Main for administrative functions.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 24 February 1984 the school officially became <em>Clarkson University</em>, although the pep band's rallying cry at hockey games is still &quot;Let's Go Tech!&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The school and its hockey team have carried the nickname &quot;Tech&quot; since the 1896 founding.
established$$$@@@%%%&quot;CCT&quot; is still printed on older school property and equipment.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Much to the dismay of many alumni, the <a>State University of New York at Canton</a> (SUNY Canton) in neighboring <a>Canton</a> has informally adopted the moniker Canton College of Technology.</p>
