<p>  <strong>Minneapolis College of Art and Design</strong> (MCAD) is a private, nonprofit four-year and postgraduate <a>college</a> specializing in the <a>visual arts</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>MCAD was founded in 1886 by the trustees of the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> and originally named the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts.
Its first class was held in a rented apartment in downtown <a>Minneapolis</a> and had an enrollment of 28 students, 26 of whom were women.</p>
By the turn of the century, the school had two instructors and had instituted a summer term, in addition to night classes for people in the community.
In 1910, the School of Fine Arts changed its name to the Minneapolis School of Art to reflect the new emphasis on applied arts.
<p>In 1914, the school moved to its present location one mile south of downtown <a>Minneapolis</a>, and set up its classrooms and studios within the newly constructed <a>Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>.
The 10-acre site for the museum and school was donated to the <a>City of Minneapolis</a> in 1911 by prominent local banker and businessman Clinton Morrison (1842-1913).
It was formerly occupied by Villa Rosa, the home and estate of Morrison's parents <a>Dorilus Morrison</a> (1814-1897), the first mayor of Minneapolis, and Harriet Whitmore Morrison (died 1880).
<p>In 1916, the school moved into its own nearby facilities in the new Julia Morrison Memorial Building, which was built with funds provided to the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> by Dr. Angus Washburn Morrison (1883-?) and his sister, Ethel Morrison Van Derlip (1876-1921), as a memorial to their mother, Julia Kellogg Washburn Morrison (died 1883), the wife of Clinton Morrison.
Designed by Edwin H. Hewitt, a former <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> president, the Morrison Building featured three large painting studios with skylights, administrative offices, workshops and an auditorium.
<p>In 1970, the School was renamed the Minneapolis College of Art and Design to reflect the broadening of its fine arts and liberal arts curricula.
By this time, with enrollment of nearly 600 students, the college had outgrown its facilities, and in 1974 expanded into a building designed by the renowned Japanese modernist architect <a>Kenzo Tange</a> (1913-2005) as part of the new &quot;arts complex&quot; that included the <a>Children's Theatre Company</a> and a major addition to the <a>Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>.
<p>On July 1, 1988, MCAD became a wholly independent institution, no longer governed by the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a>.

MCAD Continuing Studies department will host a workshop of anime and manga art called Schoolgirls and Mobilesuits September 25-27.
