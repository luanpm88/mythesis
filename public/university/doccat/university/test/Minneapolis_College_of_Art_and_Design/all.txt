established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>MCAD was founded in 1886 by the trustees of the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> and originally named the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts.
established$$$@@@%%%Its first class was held in a rented apartment in downtown <a>Minneapolis</a> and had an enrollment of 28 students, 26 of whom were women.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<pre></pre>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In December 1889, the School found a more permanent home on the top floor of the just-finished <a>Minneapolis Public Library</a> at 10th Street and Hennepin Avenue.
established$$$@@@%%%By the turn of the century, the school had two instructors and had instituted a summer term, in addition to night classes for people in the community.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1910, the School of Fine Arts changed its name to the Minneapolis School of Art to reflect the new emphasis on applied arts.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1914, the school moved to its present location one mile south of downtown <a>Minneapolis</a>, and set up its classrooms and studios within the newly constructed <a>Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The 10-acre site for the museum and school was donated to the <a>City of Minneapolis</a> in 1911 by prominent local banker and businessman Clinton Morrison (1842-1913).
established$$$@@@%%%It was formerly occupied by Villa Rosa, the home and estate of Morrison's parents <a>Dorilus Morrison</a> (1814-1897), the first mayor of Minneapolis, and Harriet Whitmore Morrison (died 1880).
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1916, the school moved into its own nearby facilities in the new Julia Morrison Memorial Building, which was built with funds provided to the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> by Dr. Angus Washburn Morrison (1883-?) and his sister, Ethel Morrison Van Derlip (1876-1921), as a memorial to their mother, Julia Kellogg Washburn Morrison (died 1883), the wife of Clinton Morrison.
established$$$@@@%%%Designed by Edwin H. Hewitt, a former <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a> president, the Morrison Building featured three large painting studios with skylights, administrative offices, workshops and an auditorium.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1970, the School was renamed the Minneapolis College of Art and Design to reflect the broadening of its fine arts and liberal arts curricula.
established$$$@@@%%%By this time, with enrollment of nearly 600 students, the college had outgrown its facilities, and in 1974 expanded into a building designed by the renowned Japanese modernist architect <a>Kenzo Tange</a> (1913-2005) as part of the new &quot;arts complex&quot; that included the <a>Children's Theatre Company</a> and a major addition to the <a>Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>On July 1, 1988, MCAD became a wholly independent institution, no longer governed by the <a>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts</a>.
