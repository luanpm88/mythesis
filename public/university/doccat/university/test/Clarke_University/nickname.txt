The next day, students hung a large banner reading &quot;<em>Clarke Lives!</em>&quot; on the campus to show solidarity following the disaster.
The grounds are bounded by West Locust Street on the south, Clarke Crest Court on the north, Clarke Crest Drive on the east, and North Grandview Avenue on the west.
Many faculty offices are located in this hall, including a number of those faculty teaching in the fields of mathematics, sciences, and business.
In addition to a number of classrooms, there are a number of rooms designated for laboratory teaching in the physics, chemistry, and biology fields.
In addition to student dormitories, there is a recreational center in the basement (known as the &quot;Lions Den&quot;), and apartments for visitors on the ground floor of the building.
The first and second floors are reserved for female students, with the third floor reserved for male students.
The configuration of the next three stories has varied from year to year based upon enrollment and students electing to live on campus, but generally the majority of residents in Mary Josita Hall are male.</p>
While straight theater productions are staged in TDH, musical theater productions are generally staged in Jansen Music Hall (located in the Wahlert Atrium) because there are no available pianos or orchestra space available in the hall.</p>
