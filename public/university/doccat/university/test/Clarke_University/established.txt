<h2>History</h2>
<p>What is now known as Clarke University was founded in 1843 by <a>Mother Mary Frances Clarke</a> as a boarding school for local girls, and was known as Saint Mary's Academy.
It was one of the first such schools built west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>, and operated out of several different locations in its early years.</p>
<p>In 1881, St. Mary's moved to its present location atop Dubuque's Seminary Hill (Clarke Drive) and was renamed Mount St.
Joseph Academy and College.
The college became a liberal arts school in 1901, and the first <a>bachelor's degree</a> was awarded in 1904.
Joseph was chartered by the state of <a>Iowa</a>, becoming a four-year college by 1913.
The academy portion of the school closed in 1928, and the college was given its current name of Clarke College, in honor of Mother Mary Frances Clarke.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Clarke College History&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>In 1964, Clarke began a graduate program, with the first <a>master's degree</a>s awarded in 1967.
The school was one of the first in <a>Iowa</a> to offer a program in <a>Computer Science</a>.
Although Clarke College had been an all-female school since its founding, it became a <a>coeducational</a> institution in the spring of 1979.</p>
<p>On May 17, 1984, the school experienced a disastrous fire that destroyed four of its main buildings, including the Sacred Heart Chapel.
Soon after, the school launched a major reconstruction project to replace the destroyed buildings.
By 1986, a new library, music performance hall, chapel, bookstore, administrative offices, and central atrium were dedicated.
The massive, glass-enclosed Wahlert Atrium built following the fire has since become the main symbol of the school.&lt;ref

--&gt; Clarke sits on a  campus located atop a prominent hill in Dubuque.
The campus is surrounded by residential neighborhoods on the north and east, <a>Dubuque Senior High School</a> on the south, and Bunker Hill Golf Course on the west.
<p>The Wahlert Atrium is the main building of the campus and is depicted in much of the graphic art associated with the college.
It was built in 1986, following the fire which destroyed four main buildings on the south end of the campus.
It is made of glass and steel, with inner rooms framed by brick walls.
From the Atrium, one can access any of the other buildings on the south side of the campus.
The Atrium holds classrooms for art and music, as well as the Jansen Music Hall (recital hall on campus), the library, Sacred Heart Chapel, administrative offices, and the switchboard.</p>
There is a cadaver laboratory in the basement, as well as a planetarium on the top floor.
Catherine Byrne Hall is generally regarded as only one of two major halls that is colloquially mentioned by its initials.</p>
<p>Eliza Kelly Hall (or EKH) is one of the three remaining buildings on the campus that have survived from the origination of the college to the present day.
It houses offices of faculty that teach in the music, art, drama&#x2013;speech, and communication departments.
Colloquially, students refer to the hall as &quot;Eliza Kelly&quot;.
In Dubuque, Clarke is known as the &quot;College for the Arts&quot;, and the faculty of the Art Department is quite impressive.
The faculty consists of Al Grivetti (graphic design), Louise Kames (printmaking), Jessica Rebik (painting), Doug Schlesier (sculpture/drawing) Carmelle Zserdin, BVM (ceramics) and Bryan Zygmont, Ph.D (art history).</p>
A number of upperclass women also live here, at their discretion.
It is a five-floor building with a basement that holds a hallway linking it to the rest of the southern side of campus.
Most of the students refer to the building colloquially as &quot;Mary Ben.&quot;</p>
It is reserved for juniors and seniors who maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.5 or better.
It is one of two buildings in the college where students may possess alcohol, and then only students over 21 may have it legally in their rooms.
It is one of the three &quot;original&quot; buildings still remaining from the origination of the college.
It is a four-story building with a central complex extending into western and eastern wings.
The legend that floats about campus is of a nun hanging herself in her room with the blood oozing onto the floor, which reappears each time the floor has been cleaned.
Also, there had been an etching on the window that is sometimes visible from the outside which reads, &quot;Help Me&quot;.
It is four stories tall, with a basement hallway linking it to Mary Benedict Hall.
The first floor is reserved for offices of faculty that teach in the humanities, philosophy, social sciences, political sciences, and history departments.
The arena area of the Kehl Center includes an indoor track, a competition basketball court (with three intramural basketball courts overlapping the main court), two racquetball courts (one filled with cardio equipment), one newly designed weight room, and locker room facilities.
In the Student Activity Center, there is a game room, the Whitlow Bookstore, the Crusader Cafe (an alternative to the main dining hall set up in the fashion of a fast-food grill), the Mail Center, and a stage for entertainment.
The Kehl Center Arena was constructed in 1997, with the SAC being added on to the main building in 2000.</p>
Terence Donaghoe Hall is the third &quot;original&quot; building to have survived to present day.
