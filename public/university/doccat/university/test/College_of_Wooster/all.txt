established$$$@@@%%%Founded in 1866 by the <a>Presbyterian</a> church as the University of Wooster, it was from its creation a <a>co-educational</a> institution.

established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|200px|left|Kauke Hall is the main academic building on campus</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Founded as The University of Wooster in 1866 by <a>Presbyterians</a> who wanted to do their part in the education of young people, the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women.
established$$$@@@%%%Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first , a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town.
established$$$@@@%%%After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university's first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie Irish, in 1882.
established$$$@@@%%%The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the pre-dawn hours of December 11, 1901, a fire destroyed the five-story 'Old Main' building, the centerpiece of the campus.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Within two years, it was replaced by several new buildings which (after substantial renovations within the last 30 years) remain the primary structures for the classes, labs, and faculty offices.
image_size$$$@@@%%%These include Kauke Hall (the iconic center of campus), Scovel Hall and Severance Hall (which together form a large courtyard in front of Kauke Hall), and Taylor Hall.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A decade after the fire and rebuilding, there were eight divisions, including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences.
established$$$@@@%%%However, the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and, in 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees, chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts.
established$$$@@@%%%The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small, around 1800 students, to allow for close interaction between faculty and students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College's  campus boasts of an unusual tree endowment, established in 1987, which supports a tree conservation, maintenance and replacement program.
established$$$@@@%%%Near the center of campus lies the Oak Grove, a pleasant green space which is the site for the commencement ceremony each May.
established$$$@@@%%%Several of its trees are older than the college itself, including a  <a>black oak</a> near Galpin Hall that dates to 1681, as well as a 1766 <a>white oak</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Each senior class plants a class tree in the Oak Grove on the day before graduation.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Academics</h2>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>Students entering Wooster are provided with a liberal arts education, a learning approach that encourages students to experience different fields of study and once majors are chosen, to bring those varied experiences to their selected fields of study.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Upon completion of at least 32 courses, students may earn a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Music Education degree.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to the programs listed below, students may design their own major with approval from the <a>registrar</a> and the Provost.
type$$$@@@%%%Some of the pre-professional programs listed below are cooperative programs, in which students spend a certain period of time at the College of Wooster before transferring to accelerated courses at other colleges and universities.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<h3>Independent Study program</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The College of Wooster is especially noteworthy for its Independent Study program, in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written <a>thesis</a> or other significant project during the course of the senior year.
faculty$$$@@@%%%The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee.
established$$$@@@%%%The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the College's 7th President), has received considerable attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only <a>Princeton University</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This unique approach to education has long kept Wooster competitive against better-known colleges.
type$$$@@@%%%As evidence of this fact, Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D.'s between 1920 and 1995 (according to the <a>Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients,1998</a>). </p>
head_label$$$@@@%%%<p>Special traditions have been developed surrounding Independent Study.
country$$$@@@%%%Upon completion, a student will receive a yellow button that says 'I did it!'
established$$$@@@%%%as well as the highly coveted <a>Tootsie Roll</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The tradition developed when the registrar at the time, Lee Culp (also a graduate of the College of Wooster), decided to give out candy along with the buttons one year; the Tootsie Roll itself was chosen simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk.
established$$$@@@%%%The 'due date,' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project, is the first Monday after spring break.
established$$$@@@%%%On I.S. Monday, the <a>pipe band</a> begins a drone and, with the Provost leading the way, the seniors travel through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade ending at Kittredge dining hall, where a celebratory dinner with their advisors and college administrators follows.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>International presence</h3>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>Wooster has long emphasized international education.
established$$$@@@%%%An unusually high percentage of its early graduates went overseas as missionaries (Wooster has its own unique collection of artifacts sent back from those alumni, including among other things an Egyptian mummy), and soon not only their sons and daughters, but also the students from their schools, were enrolling at Wooster as students.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. Elias Compton, former dean of the College, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with <a>Ewing Christian College</a> in <a>Allahabad, India</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This international presence affected the entire campus, establishing a tradition which continues to influence the College.
established$$$@@@%%%Today, approximately six percent of the student body is international in origin, representing more than 30 different countries.
established$$$@@@%%%Babcock Hall offers cross-cultural programming that includes regular hall meetings with student speakers and cultural activities; celebrations of holidays from around the world; and discussions of international issues led by faculty and invited speakers.

established$$$@@@%%%In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the <a>Ohio Five</a>) broke away from the OAC to form the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a> (NCAC).
established$$$@@@%%%The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship <a>Division III</a> level of the <a>NCAA</a>, was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.

nickname$$$@@@%%%Early Wooster teams were known as the Presbyterians, or unofficially as the 'Presbyterian Steamroller,' due to the football team's success.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black <a>MacLeod</a> tartan, which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Scottish</a> culture eventually became an important part of the school's heritage; today, the <a>football</a> games feature a Scottish <a>pipe band</a> with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan.
