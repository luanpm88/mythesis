<p> <strong>The College of Wooster</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> primarily known for its <a>'Independent Study' program</a>.
It has roughly 2,000 students and is located in <a>Wooster</a>, <a>Wayne County</a>, <a>Ohio</a> (approximately  south of <a>Cleveland</a>).
Founded in 1866 by the <a>Presbyterian</a> church as the University of Wooster, it was from its creation a <a>co-educational</a> institution.
The school is a member of The <a>Five Colleges of Ohio</a> and the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded as The University of Wooster in 1866 by <a>Presbyterians</a> who wanted to do their part in the education of young people, the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women.
Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first , a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town.
After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university's first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie Irish, in 1882.
The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.</p>
<p>In the pre-dawn hours of December 11, 1901, a fire destroyed the five-story 'Old Main' building, the centerpiece of the campus.
<p>A decade after the fire and rebuilding, there were eight divisions, including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences.
However, the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and, in 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees, chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts.
The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small, around 1800 students, to allow for close interaction between faculty and students.</p>
<p>The College's  campus boasts of an unusual tree endowment, established in 1987, which supports a tree conservation, maintenance and replacement program.
Near the center of campus lies the Oak Grove, a pleasant green space which is the site for the commencement ceremony each May.
Several of its trees are older than the college itself, including a  <a>black oak</a> near Galpin Hall that dates to 1681, as well as a 1766 <a>white oak</a>.
Each senior class plants a class tree in the Oak Grove on the day before graduation.</p>
<p>The College of Wooster is especially noteworthy for its Independent Study program, in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written <a>thesis</a> or other significant project during the course of the senior year.
The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the College's 7th President), has received considerable attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it.
In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only <a>Princeton University</a>.
as well as the highly coveted <a>Tootsie Roll</a>.
The tradition developed when the registrar at the time, Lee Culp (also a graduate of the College of Wooster), decided to give out candy along with the buttons one year; the Tootsie Roll itself was chosen simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk.
The 'due date,' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project, is the first Monday after spring break.
On I.S. Monday, the <a>pipe band</a> begins a drone and, with the Provost leading the way, the seniors travel through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade ending at Kittredge dining hall, where a celebratory dinner with their advisors and college administrators follows.</p>
<p>The College of Wooster Libraries consists of three branches (Andrews Library, The Flo K. Gault Library, and The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall) and a music library located at the Scheide Music Center.
Andrews Library, the largest library in the system, houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers.
The Flo K. Gault Library, built as an addition to Andrews Library in 1995, primarily serves as a place for class seniors to work on their Independent Study projects.
The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall (1900, 1998), which is the oldest branch in the system, served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962.
The building reopened in 1998, with substantial funding from the Timken Foundation of Canton, Ohio, and now primarily serves students in the math and sciences departments.
The library provides Independent Study carrels for math and science seniors.</p>
<li><strong>CONSORT:</strong> The College of Wooster became a founding member of the Five Colleges of Ohio Consortium in 1996.
The College of Wooster merged its library catalogue with <a>Denison University</a>, <a>Kenyon College</a>, and <a>Ohio Wesleyan University</a> to form the <a>CONSORT</a> library system.
The CONSORT library system provides its patrons access to the combined holdings of all four colleges.</li>
<li><strong>OhioLINK:</strong> CONSORT is a member of <a>OhioLINK</a>, a statewide consortium of academic libraries as well as the State Library of Ohio, which agreed to make their collections available to library patrons within this network.
CONSORT's membership into OhioLink gives its patrons immediate access to a collection of books, online journals, and databases that rivals the largest academic libraries in the country.
The OhioLINK catalogue represents 89 libraries in the state and lists nearly 11.5 million unique titles from total holdings of 48 million items.</li>
<p>The College of Wooster Art Museum was established in the 1930s as a small gallery to facilitate the teaching of art and art research at the college.
The current museum was established at the Ebert Art Center in 1997.
The museum houses two small galleries, the Charlene Derge Sussel Art Gallery and the Burton D. Morgan Gallery, as well as storage for the college's permanent art collection.
The museum's encyclopedic collection spans from ancient to contemporary art.
Permanent collections include the John Taylor Arms Print Collection - which represents works by <a>Edward Hopper</a>, <a>Winslow Homer</a>, <a>Isabel Bishop</a>, <a>Martin Lewis</a>, <a>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</a>, <a>Albrecht D&#x00fc;rer</a>, <a>K&#x00e4;the Kollwitz</a>, and <a>F&#x00e9;lix Bracquemond</a> - the William C. Mithoefer Collection of African Art, Middle Eastern pottery, and Chinese decorative art.</p>
An unusually high percentage of its early graduates went overseas as missionaries (Wooster has its own unique collection of artifacts sent back from those alumni, including among other things an Egyptian mummy), and soon not only their sons and daughters, but also the students from their schools, were enrolling at Wooster as students.
Dr. Elias Compton, former dean of the College, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with <a>Ewing Christian College</a> in <a>Allahabad, India</a>.
Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall.
The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures.
Today, approximately six percent of the student body is international in origin, representing more than 30 different countries.
Babcock Hall offers cross-cultural programming that includes regular hall meetings with student speakers and cultural activities; celebrations of holidays from around the world; and discussions of international issues led by faculty and invited speakers.
<li><strong>History:</strong> Wooster's athletic history dates back to its first baseball team, in 1880, which played only one game, losing 12-2 to <a>Kenyon College</a>.
The football program was established in 1889; over its first two seasons, the team won all seven games it played, by a total score of 306-4.
Included was a 64-0 victory at <a>Ohio State</a> on November 1, 1890, in the Buckeyes' first-ever home football game.
Shortly thereafter, intercollegiate sports were banned by the College President.
In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the <a>Ohio Five</a>) broke away from the OAC to form the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a> (NCAC).
The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship <a>Division III</a> level of the <a>NCAA</a>, was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.
In its first season of competition, 1984&#x2013;85, the NCAC sponsored 21 sports, eleven for men and ten for women.
Women's softball was added in 1998, and women's golf in 2010, giving the NCAC its current 23 sports.
In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black <a>MacLeod</a> tartan, which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors.
<a>Scottish</a> culture eventually became an important part of the school's heritage; today, the <a>football</a> games feature a Scottish <a>pipe band</a> with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan.
Prior to Pettorini's tenure, Bob Morgan led the Scots to the NCAA tournament in each of his final five seasons, giving Wooster a total of 25 appearances since the event began in 1976.
During the first decade of the 21st century, the Scots had a record of 372-98, winning more games than any other team in Division III, and were second in winning percentage over that span, trailing only  <a>St.
Following his graduation, Johnson signed with the <a>Toronto Blue Jays</a> organization, and is currently playing in their minor-league system.</li>
<li><strong>Basketball:</strong> In 23 seasons at Wooster, head men's <a>basketball</a> coach Steve Moore has won over 500 games, and he is among the all-time winningest coaches in D-III basketball.
Since 1991, the Scots have made 18 appearances in the <a>NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship</a>, more than any other school during that span, failing to earn a berth only in 1994 and 2002.
The 2003 team set a school record for victories, with a record of 30-3, and Wooster center Bryan Nelson was named D-III Men's Basketball Player of the Year.
Since 2000, the Scots have been in the top ten in D-III basketball attendance every year, ranking 4th in 2008-09 with nearly 1,700 fans per home game.</li>
The 1934 title would be the Scots' last outright conference championship for 70 years, with only a pair of shared conference titles (1959 OAC and 1997 NCAC) during that time.
The 2008 Scots had a record of 8-2, placing second in the NCAC and narrowly missing an NCAA playoff berth.
The first-ever nighttime football game at Wooster was played on October 10, 2009, against <a>Case Western Reserve University</a>, with Case retaining the <a>Baird Brothers Trophy</a> by virtue of a 53-32 victory over the Scots.</li>
This was the sixth conference title of the decade for the women's lacrosse team.
<li><strong>Academic All-Americans:</strong> Three Scots were named Academic All-Americans in 2009-10 by ESPN The Magazine, in the College division, which includes NCAA Division II and Division III institutions, as well as NAIA schools, a total of over 1000 colleges.
Chantal Koechli, carrying a 3.97 GPA in biochemistry and molecular biology, was twice a member of the Academic All-American first team in women's soccer.
Jay Keener, a chemistry major with a 3.94 GPA, was named a first-team Academic All-American in men's soccer.
following a year working in industry.</li>
<p>Besides having a well-respected music department, Wooster is the home of the <a>Ohio Light Opera</a>, an endeavor founded within the college in 1979, but is not a part of the college curriculum.
<p>The college is also one of a few colleges in America to have an active on-campus pipe band.
Wooster was the only American band competing.</p>
<p>In 2007, Wooster's theatre production of 'Nocturne' was invited to perform at the Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Wooster's production was one of four shows chosen from a field of approximately 400 entries.</p>
<p>The College of Wooster has over one hundred student organizations, from the Jenny Investment Club, which allows students to invest real money for the College as they learn about the stock market, to Common Grounds, a student-run coffee shop and house program offering 'an alternative atmosphere to the partying scene' for the College community.</p>
<em>The Wooster Voice</em> is the weekly student newspaper with a newly launched website, and has been published continuously since 1886 (see <a>list of college newspapers</a>), while <a>WCWS</a> (WOO 91) is the college radio station.
Additionally, the English Department has classes every two years on journalism and magazine writing; these students create and publish a newspaper and a magazine respectively.</p>
