<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a result of efforts undertaken together by the Synod of Virginia and the Synod of North Carolina, Union Theological Seminary was founded in 1812 as the theological department of <a>Hampden-Sydney College</a>, located near <a>Farmville, Virginia</a>.
In 1898, the school was relocated to its current campus location on the north side of Richmond, Virginia.
The General Assembly&#x2019;s Training School (ATS) for Lay Workers was founded in Richmond in 1914 as a complementary institution intended to train &#x201c;workers outside of the regular ordained ministry.&#x201d;
In 1959 ATS was renamed the Presbyterian School of Christian Education (PSCE).
PSCE offered a Masters Degree in Christian Education, and operated across the street from Union Seminary until 1997, when Union and PSCE were joined in federation, becoming Union-PSCE.
In 2002, a commuter campus in Charlotte, North Carolina, began on the campus of <a>Queens University of Charlotte</a>, offering both M.Div.
<p>In 2009, Union's Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the institution to Union Presbyterian Seminary.
It was sold to commercial interests in 1988.</p>
<p>Union has a faculty of scholars in the fields of <a>Bible</a>, <a>Christian education</a>, <a>theology</a>, <a>ethics</a>, <a>preaching</a>, <a>worship</a>, <a>church history</a>, and <a>pastoral care</a>.
While the Union curriculum teaches in the Reformed theological tradition, faculty come from a range of denominational backgrounds, including Baptist, Lutheran and Methodist.
These scholars have written hundreds of books and articles in their respective fields of study.</p>
The majority of Union's students come from the Presbyterian tradition, but the seminary draws students from more than 20 Christian denominations, including Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian and Reformed.
The seminary is a member of the <a>Richmond Theological Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>Students at Union take part in a number of student activities and seminary initiatives, such as intramural sports (including hosting an annual <a>Ultimate Frisbee</a> tournament for seminaries), mission and service activities in the city of Richmond, and Project Burning Bush, the seminary's youth leadership initiative supported by the Lily Foundation.</p>
<p>Union's Richmond Campus includes two chapels: the historic Watts Chapel, located in Watts Hall, which also serves as a classroom and administration building, and the state of the art Lake Chapel, located in the campus's new Early Center, a classroom and office building completed in 2008.
Union's William Smith Morton Library was completed in 1996, and includes over 900,000 volumes and grows at a rate of about 5,500 volumes per year.
Union shares its library resources with the <a>Baptist Theological Seminary of Richmond</a>, located across Brook Road.</p>
