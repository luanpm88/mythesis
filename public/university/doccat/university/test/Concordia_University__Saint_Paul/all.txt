established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
website$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early history</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Concordia University was founded in 1893 to provide a Christian learning environment for high school students preparing to enter the professional ministries of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.
established$$$@@@%%%The first students were welcomed to class on September 13, 1893, in temporary quarters next to Zion Lutheran Church in St. Paul.
established$$$@@@%%%The following year, Concordia spent $22,000 to purchase  and several buildings previously owned by the state training school for boys in its current location midway between downtown <a>Minneapolis</a> and St. Paul.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the next decade, Concordia continued to grow, adding a fourth year of high school, and then freshman and sophomore college years.
established$$$@@@%%%Concordia's early success fueled new construction projects on campus, including the Gymnasium (converted in the 1950s to Graebner Memorial Chapel) and Recitation Hall (now the Classroom Building).
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Dr. Theodore Buenger served as Concordia St. Paul's professor and first director.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Concordia earned accreditation as a two-year college in 1921.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The change made it possible for Concordia High School students to remain at their high school alma mater to complete their first two years of college work before transferring to a Concordia senior college where they would finish their studies in the church professions or teaching.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Rev. Martin A.H. Graebner was installed in 1927 as Concordia's second president, serving until 1946.</p>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<h3>Through the Depression</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college continued to thrive until 1931 when the effects of the financial panic of 1929 and the Great Depression caused enrollments to drop precipitously from 282 to 131.
established$$$@@@%%%There were far fewer pulpits available than pastors to fill them, and The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod considered closing the college for a year or two to wait out the financial slump.
established$$$@@@%%%Budgets were slashed, three residence halls stood empty, students worked around campus without pay, and food donations from congregations helped supplement the school's food service.
established$$$@@@%%%It was, perhaps, the most difficult era in the history of Concordia, but the college survived.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>As the <a>United States</a> entered <a>World War II</a>, Concordia St. Paul's fortunes once again shifted in a more positive direction.
established$$$@@@%%%Enrollment was on the upswing and Concordia was poised to help respond to a growing shortage of pastors in the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1943, Concordia St. Paul celebrated half a century as an institution.
established$$$@@@%%%During this time, planning and fundraising for a new library began in earnest, but the project stalled for nearly a decade in the wake of post-war inflation and growing enthusiasm for another new construction on campus - the Lutheran Memorial Center, a gymnasium/auditorium and memorial to those who served in the war.

established$$$@@@%%%Concordia entered a decade of intense expansion and growth.
established$$$@@@%%%The college began granting Associate in Arts degrees in 1951 and began seeking North Central Association accreditation for the junior college in earnest.
