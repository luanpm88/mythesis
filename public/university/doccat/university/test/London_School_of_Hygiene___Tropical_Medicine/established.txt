<p><a>thumb|Main entrance</a> The <strong>London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</strong> (LSHTM or the &quot;London School&quot;) is a constituent college of the <a>University of London</a>, specialising in <a>public health</a> and <a>tropical medicine</a>.
Founded by <a>Sir Patrick Manson</a> in 1899, London School is a research-led postgraduate centre of excellence in public health, international health and tropical medicine.
The School's mission is to contribute to the improvement of health worldwide through the pursuit of excellence in research, postgraduate teaching and advanced training in national and international public health and tropical medicine, and through informing policy and practice in these areas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Malet Street</a> The School was founded in 1899 by Sir <a>Patrick Manson</a> as the London School of Tropical Medicine and located at the <a>Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital</a> in the <a>London Docklands</a>.&lt;!--  --&gt;  Prior to this, courses in tropical medicine were conducted at the Extramural School at Edinburgh, and <a>Livingstone College</a> founded in London in 1893 by Charles F. Harford-Battersby (1865&#x2013;1925).
Manson's early career was as a physician in the Far East where he deduced the correct aetiology of filariasis, a parasitic vector based disease, transmitted through the bite of a mosquito.
On his return to London, and after financial difficulties, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the Colonial Office.
He strongly believed that doctors should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain's tropical empire.
He also encouraged and mentored Ross during this period to uncover the correct aetiology of malaria, which Ross subsequently discovered in 1898, winning the Nobel Prize for his efforts.
The original School was established as part of the <a>Seamen's Hospital Society</a>, it has its origins in the hospital ships which were docked on the Thames at <a>Greenwich</a>.</p>
<p>In 1920 the School moved, with the <a>Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a>, to Endsleigh Gardens in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War.&lt;!--</p>
<p>In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine.
This enlarged School, now named the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1924.</p>
<p>The main School building is in Keppel Street in <a>Bloomsbury</a>.
This building was opened in 1929 by HRH the Prince of Wales.
The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.
A competition to design the new School building was held involving five architects, all experienced in laboratory design and construction.
<p>The School is part of the University of London and is the University's major resource for postgraduate teaching and research in public health and tropical medicine.
On successful completion of their studies, students gain a University of London degree.</p>
The School has been ranked one of the top three research institutions in the country in the Times Higher Education Table of Excellence, which is based on the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise.
In Epidemiology and Public Health, 35% of the School's research activity was assessed as 4 (world leading), with a further 35% rated as 3 (internationally excellent).
This result is particularly impressive in light of the fact that the School entered by far the highest number of staff of any UK institution (135.37),
more than double the number entered by any other institution.
In Health Services Research, 30% of its research activity received a 4* rating, and a further 35% was rated as 3.
<p>LSHTM offers a range of <a>taught Masters degrees</a> as well as research degrees leading to the University of London degree of DrPH, MPhil and PhD.</p>
<li>Analysis of routinely collected statistics</li>
<li>Conduct and analysis of observational studies</li>
<li>Design and evaluation of interventions</li>
To describe epidemiological differences between and within countries, and to contribute to the reduction of inequalities and inequity in health.
To evaluate and improve interventions:  To generate and evaluate strategies which will reduce the excess burden of disease, suffered by the poor and the vulnerable.
To assess hazards and threats to health in order to inform policy, in response to widespread public concern.
<p><a>The Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Disease</a> s (ITD) was formed in August 1997 and encompasses all of the laboratory-based research in the School as well as that on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infectious and tropical diseases.
The range of disciplines represented in the aculty is very broad and inter-disciplinary research is a feature of much of our activity.
The Faculty has strong overseas links which provide a basis for field studies and international collaborations in developed and developing countries.
Major funders of research include the Department for International Development, Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, BBSRC, GlaxoSmithKline and the Commission of European Communities.
<p><a>The Faculty of Public Health and Policy</a> aims to improve global health through research, teaching and the provision of advice in the areas of health policy, health systems and services, and individual, social and environmental influences on health.
Interests and activities embrace the health needs of people living in countries at all levels of development.
The Faculty's research programmes, with an annual spend of over &#x00a3;7m, focus on public health problems of importance both globally and in the UK, and build on an extensive network of collaborations.</p>
<li>Improving the quality, organisation and management of health services</li>
<li>Assessing the effect of environmental factors on health, especially climate change, air pollution, housing and transport, and evaluating public health policies in these areas </li>
<li>Understanding global influences on health and health systems including the role of transnational companies such as the tobacco industry, and the spread of pandemic diseases.</li>
<p>In keeping with its focus on the interface between scientific research, policy and practice, faculty staff are engaged in a very wide range of policy-influencing roles, including membership of key government advisory groups, leadership of professional bodies, membership of research funding bodies, and provision of expert advice to global health institutions.
