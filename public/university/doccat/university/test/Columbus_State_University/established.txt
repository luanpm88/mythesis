<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was first called Columbus College when it opened as a <a>junior college</a> in a hosiery mill in 1958.
<p>Columbus College relocated to the midtown area in 1963, building a campus defined by modern architecture on what was previously a dairy farm.
The school was granted four-year status in 1965 with offerings of <a>bachelor's</a> and <a>master's degree</a>s.
The first four-year class graduated in 1970.</p>
<p>In 1996 the school was renamed Columbus State University as part of a program to restructure four-year institutions within the state's university system.
The school now offers <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> programs in more than ninety academic disciplines.
In early 2007, the art and theatre departments moved to the university's newly built RiverPark Campus in downtown Columbus.
The complex was designed to provide students of the <a>fine arts</a> with a tightly-knit living community and larger studios, laboratories, and galleries.

<p>CSU's RiverPark campus, located near the banks of the <a>Chattahoochee River</a>, provides an expansion for the university's fine arts programs.
The university is continuing to expand this campus with the acquisition of older buildings, some of which have been remodeled as student housing and additional classrooms.</p>
