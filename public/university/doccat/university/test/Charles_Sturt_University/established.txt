<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|CD Blake Auditorium, Bathurst campus, CSU</a> The University was established on 1 July 1989 from the merger of several existing separately-administered <a>Colleges of Advanced Education</a> including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga and the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga, through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989).
It is named in honour of explorer <a>Charles Sturt</a>.</p>
<p>The Mitchell College of Advanced Education had been formed on 1 January 1971, and the Riverina-Murray Institute in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1985.
The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College.
<p>In 1998, CSU established the first Study Centre in Sydney  and then in Melbourne  in 2007.
<p>On 1 January 2005, CSU formalised moves to assume control of the <a>University of Sydney</a>'s <a>Orange</a> campus, which came into force on 1 January 2005.
<p>On 10 July 2007, fire destroyed a chemistry laboratory at the University's Wagga Wagga campus </p>
<p>In 2008 CSU opened a new Veterinary Clinical Centre on Wagga Wagga Campus and 2011 sees the opening of a publicly available Dental and Oral Health Clinic.</p>
Charles Sturt University's graduates with the highest public profile tend to come from the degree courses in <a>communication</a> and <a>media</a> offered on the Bathurst campus.
It also specialises in the areas of <a>pharmacy</a>, <a>visual and performing arts</a>, <a>viticulture</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, <a>dentistry</a>, <a>veterinary science</a>, <a>nursing</a>, <a>radiography</a>, <a>teaching</a>, <a>theology</a>, <a>accountancy</a> and  <a>library and information studies</a>.
For over 30 years, the University's winery has been the producer of acclaimed table wines.
The University&#x2019;s cheese factory has also achieved many awards for its specialist range, 'Bidgee Cheese', sold at the Cellar Door, and commercially throughout NSW and overseas.</p>

<p>Initially, CSU was one of a handful of Australian universities not to increase tuition fees by 25%, one of the reforms introduced by federal education minister <a>Brendan Nelson</a> in 2004, but it later voted to increase fees by the full 25% allowable starting from 2006.</p>
<p>On its Bathurst campus, CSU operates a radio station, <a>2MCE</a>, which also acts as the originating studio for <em><a>National Radio News</a></em>, a popular community radio news service.</p>
<p>After Voluntary Student Unionism was passed by the Howard government, the student unions on all campuses of CSU were dissolved and became Student Representative Committees under the university structure.</p>
The Distance Education program is designed for students who may be unable to attend the university campus in person, using printed or electronic media to facilitate communication between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Through <a>Distance Education</a>, students undertake courses supported by online forums, <a>wikis</a>, <a>blogs</a>, <a>podcasts</a>, access to library resources and assignment submission.
These subjects can provide an entry point for people who may be looking to engage in further formal study.</p>
<p>NSW HSC Online, an abbreviation of New South Wales <a>Higher School Certificate</a> Online, is a collaborative partnership between the <a>NSW Department of Education and Training</a> and Charles Sturt University.
NSW HSC Online is supported by the <a>Board of Studies</a> NSW and the <a>Professional Teachers Council</a> NSW (PTC).</p>
Students and their teachers can contact curriculum experts and participate in discussion forums for specific HSC subjects.</p>
