UTMB maintains an excellent faculty-to-student ratio, with 341 graduate students enrolled.
Every year approximately 50 graduate students enroll, and as of August 2006, there are 1,255 GSBS alumni who have gone on to diverse successful careers.&lt;br
Most of the programs and their facilities are closely allied with their medical school departments and also interact in interdisciplinary and clinical pursuits.
Tuition and fees for first-year BBSC students will be paid by the GSBS and the mentor will fund tuition fees in years thereafter.
