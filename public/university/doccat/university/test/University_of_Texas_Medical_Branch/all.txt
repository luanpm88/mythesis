established$$$@@@%%%It is a health care complex spanning 85 acres (344,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with seven hospitals, 13,000 employees and an assortment of specialized clinics, centers and institutes, including a medical school.
established$$$@@@%%%The medical school is the oldest one west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>It was established in 1891 with one building and fewer than 50 students.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%Today UTMB's campus has grown to more than 70 buildings and an enrollment of more than 2,500 students.
website$$$@@@%%%The  campus includes four schools, three institutes for advanced study, a major medical library, seven hospitals (including an affiliated <a>Shriners Burns Hospital</a>), a network of clinics that provide a full range of primary and specialized medical care, and numerous research facilities.</p>
faculty$$$@@@%%%<p>Since its founding, UTMB has served indigent or poor populaces, such as prisoners, the homeless, and single mothers, including patients with ailments that are very expensive to treat (such as burns).
established$$$@@@%%%It is one of only a handful of hospitals in southeastern Texas that does so.
established$$$@@@%%%Currently, UTMB is certified as a <a>Level I Trauma Center</a> and serves as a trauma facility for the nine-county region in southeast Texas, including the <a>Greater Houston</a> area.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<a>thumb|right|&quot;John Sealy Hospital&quot;</a> <a>thumb|right|UTMB Campus</a> The location of the Medical Department of the University of Texas was decided between Galveston and <a>Houston</a> in a popular vote in 1881, but its opening was delayed due to the construction of the main university campus in <a>Austin, Texas</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The need for medical training in Texas was great: in 1891, 80% of doctors in the state had under a year of formal training in medicine, and so the &quot;Texas Medical College&quot; was formed in Galveston with the idea that it would become the medical department once state funding began.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The original building, now called Old Red, was begun on 1890 under the supervision of the Galveston architect <a>Nicholas J. Clayton</a>.
country$$$@@@%%%Clayton toured several medical colleges in the North and East before drawing up his plans for the building.
established$$$@@@%%%The medical school campus also included the <a>John Sealy Hospital</a>, which provided charity care for any who claimed Galveston residence.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Upon opening, the Red Building had been starkly underfurnished, a problem which was not fully remedied until after the <a>Hurricane of 1900</a>, when the state rallied around the ravaged city.
established$$$@@@%%%Dr. Thompson, professor of surgery, said that &quot;the regents were so generous in repairing the damage to the building and restoring the equipment, that we were actually in better shape at the end of the year 1901 than we had been before.&quot;
nickname$$$@@@%%%In addition, the damage to the roof of Old Red allowed for the addition of sky lights, which had always been wanted for the dissection room.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Ewing Hall is named for <a>Maurice Ewing</a>, a notable alum.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>From its modest beginnings in the 1890s as the first state medical school in Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) has developed into a sophisticated health science complex for the state of Texas.
