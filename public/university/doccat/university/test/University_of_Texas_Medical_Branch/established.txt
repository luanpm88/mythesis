It is a health care complex spanning 85 acres (344,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with seven hospitals, 13,000 employees and an assortment of specialized clinics, centers and institutes, including a medical school.
The medical school is the oldest one west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>It was established in 1891 with one building and fewer than 50 students.
It is one of only a handful of hospitals in southeastern Texas that does so.
Currently, UTMB is certified as a <a>Level I Trauma Center</a> and serves as a trauma facility for the nine-county region in southeast Texas, including the <a>Greater Houston</a> area.</p>
<p>The UTMB campus includes a <a>Shriners Hospitals for Children</a> and a <a>prison</a> hospital that serves 80% of the Texas prison inmate population [<a>http://www.utmb.edu/cmc/</a>].
<p>In 2003 UTMB received funding to construct a $150 million <a>Galveston National Biocontainment Laboratory</a> on its campus, one of only two in the United States and the only one on a university campus.
It houses several <a>Biosafety Level 4</a> research laboratories, where studies on highly infectious materials can be carried out safely.</p>
<p>It has schools of <a>medicine</a>, <a>nursing</a>, allied health professions, and a <a>graduate school</a> of biomedical sciences, as well as an institute for medical humanities.</p>
<p>UTMB is currently in the process of recovering from the effects of <a>Hurricane Ike</a>.
Employees returned to work in early October, 2008.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<a>thumb|right|&quot;John Sealy Hospital&quot;</a> <a>thumb|right|UTMB Campus</a> The location of the Medical Department of the University of Texas was decided between Galveston and <a>Houston</a> in a popular vote in 1881, but its opening was delayed due to the construction of the main university campus in <a>Austin, Texas</a>.
The need for medical training in Texas was great: in 1891, 80% of doctors in the state had under a year of formal training in medicine, and so the &quot;Texas Medical College&quot; was formed in Galveston with the idea that it would become the medical department once state funding began.
<p>The original building, now called Old Red, was begun on 1890 under the supervision of the Galveston architect <a>Nicholas J. Clayton</a>.
The medical school campus also included the <a>John Sealy Hospital</a>, which provided charity care for any who claimed Galveston residence.</p>
<p>Upon opening, the Red Building had been starkly underfurnished, a problem which was not fully remedied until after the <a>Hurricane of 1900</a>, when the state rallied around the ravaged city.
Dr. Thompson, professor of surgery, said that &quot;the regents were so generous in repairing the damage to the building and restoring the equipment, that we were actually in better shape at the end of the year 1901 than we had been before.&quot;
<p>Ewing Hall is named for <a>Maurice Ewing</a>, a notable alum.</p>
<p>From its modest beginnings in the 1890s as the first state medical school in Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) has developed into a sophisticated health science complex for the state of Texas.
UTMB is a large health sciences center, with the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Medicine, the School of Nursing,the School of Health Professions, the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, the Institute for the Medical Humanities, an affiliated Shriners Burns Hospital, the Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, the Sealy Center for Structural Biology, the Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Center for Addiction Research, the Educational Cancer Center, the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women&#x2019;s Health, the Insyitute for Translational Sciences [<a>http://www.its.utmb.edu/ctsalinks.htm</a>],
<p>UTMB occupies  at the eastern end of Galveston Island.
The research facilities include the only full-sized biosafety level 4 laboratory associated with a medical school in the U.S., completed in 2003.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) selected UTMB as the site of a $150 million national biocontainment lab, one of two large-scale national research facilities focusing on new and emerging disease threats, which opened in August 2008.
<p>UTMB&#x2019;s annual budget of approximately $1.4 billion includes grants, awards, and contracts from federal and private sources totaling more than $150 million, in addition to institutional allocations for research.</p>
Mary's Hospital</a>, the first catholic hospital in Texas.
The building was converted into the Rebecca Sealy Psychiatric Hospital.</p>
<p>The UTMB became a member of the Houston-based <a>Texas Medical Center</a> in 2010.</p>
at UTMB has provided medical school or residency training to one in six Texas physicians.
With 20 departments, three institutes and a unique partnership with the University of Texas at Austin and Seton Healthcare in Austin, UTMB&#x2019;s School of Medicine is a leader in medical school education, translational research and clinical care.
The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) is a major academic health center in the fields of health sciences education, clinical care and biomedical research.
<li><strong>Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</strong> - The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) is one of four degree-granting schools at UTMB and plays a major role in research and scholarship at the university [<a>http://gsbs.utmb.edu</a>].
Biomedical graduate programs were started in 1952, and a separate graduate school was established in 1969, becoming the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in 1972.
/&gt;The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences provides a basic science background for its students.&lt;br
have created a concurrent enrollment program by which graduate students at UTMB can pursue both a Ph.D. and an M.B.A. in preparation for careers in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry, among other career opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;For
Students may qualify for predoctoral fellowships from the graduate school with an initial stipend of at least $27,000 (2010&#x2013;2011), and paid health insurance for those pursuing a Ph.D. degree.
<p>Hurricane Ike caused significant flood damage to nearly every building on campus, including the John Sealy Hospital.
Much of the money was approved by the 81st Texas Legislative session, $450 million comes from FEMA, $130 million from insurance, $200 million from the <a>Sealy and Smith Foundation</a>, and $50 million from the Social Service Block Grant Funds.
It should be noted that UTMB restored its educational programs within weeks after the Hurricane Ike and the research endeavor came back steadily thereafter.</p>
