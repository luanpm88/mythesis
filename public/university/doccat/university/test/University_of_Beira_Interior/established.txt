<h2>History</h2>
<p>In August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a <a>polytechnic</a>al institution in Covilh&#x00e3;, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilh&#x00e3; (<em>IPC - Instituto Polit&#x00e9;cnico da Covilh&#x00e3;</em>), which was the first higher education institution in the city.
Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow.
This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, <a>university institute</a>.
Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full <a>university</a> status and renamed University of Beira Interior (<em>Universidade da Beira Interior</em>).</p>
<li>The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics; Physics; and Chemistry.
<li>The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics; Department of Sociology; Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences.
<li>The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters </li>
<p>In order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development.</p>
<p>The <a>Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira</a> (Cova da Beira Hospital Center), with facilities in <a>Covilh&#x00e3;</a> and <a>Fund&#x00e3;o</a>, is the <a>teaching hospital</a> of the University of Beira Interior.</p>

<p>The university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilh&#x00e3; industrial roots.
The city was an important textile centre, once known as the &quot;Portuguese Manchester&quot;.
Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, are started the 21st century serving the noble purpose of educating the Portuguese society.</p>
The university campus is divided into several spaces, called <em>P&#x00f3;los</em>, which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution.</p>
<p>The synopsis below provides information about the <em>P&#x00f3;los</em> of UBI and its libraries:</p>
<li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo I</strong> - The main building is a 17th century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices.
New buildings near have been erected over the years to keep up the continuous growth of the UBI.
<li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo II</strong> - On a hill, less than 1&nbsp;km from P&#x00f3;lo I, and meeting the UBI need for constant expansion, an area was created where several central infrastructures, as the emblematic 16th century convent that nowadays houses the <a>Rectory</a>, the administration services and the international relations office.
It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the <a>Central Hospital</a> in a distance of 1&nbsp;km far from P&#x00f3;lo I.</li>
<li><strong>P&#x00f3;lo IV</strong> - This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university.
It houses the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, the Cyber Centre [<a>http://www.cybercentro-covilha.pt/</a>] and a residence hall with Snack Bar.</li>
Once the Library Card is issued, students can use it to borrow books from any library.
The Main Library offers a wide range of services spread among 3 different floors.
One of the residence halls is located in <em>P&#x00f3;lo II</em>, 5 minutes of walking distance from the university's main buildings (<em>P&#x00f3;lo I</em>) and the other (<em>Resid&#x00ea;ncia Pedro &#x00c1;lvares Cabral</em>) is located near the <em>P&#x00f3;lo IV</em>.
The Students' Social Affairs Centre manages all the university housing offers.</p>
The union also has its office in <em>P&#x00f3;lo I</em>, two floors upstairs from the bank.</p>
<p>The students' union (AAUBI) offers a wide range of activities concerning sports, culture and leisure.

<p><a>thumb|right|220px|Wool museum entrance, to the right, which is delimited by two pedestrian bridges that connect two of the UBI's buildings</a> The UBI adapted the buildings of the former <em>Real F&#x00e1;brica de Panos</em> (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by <a>Marqu&#x00ea;s de Pombal</a> in 1764.
This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the Regimento de Infantaria 21 (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the Batalh&#x00e3;o de Ca&#x00e7;adores 2 (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion).</p>
<p>In 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered.
The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored.
The museum is open on weekdays except Monday from 9:30h to midday and from 14:30h to 18h.</p>
