<h2>History</h2>

<h2>The University of Lethbridge Art Gallery</h2>
<p>The University of Lethbridge Art Gallery has one of the largest collections in Canada of 19th and 20th century Canadian, American and European art, with over 13,000 pieces including drawing, print making, painting, photography, sculpture and installation.
Josephine Mills was appointed Director/Curator of the Art Gallery in 2001 and maintains a strong exhibition, publication and research program.</p>
<p>The collection quickly outgrew available archiving and storage space, so a new building was completed in 1999 to house large works.
Additional renovations were made in 2000 and 2003 to update a study area for the collection and an incoming/outgoing art handling area.</p>
<p>In 2006, a comprehensive registration database was made available online of the University of Lethbridge collections.</p>
