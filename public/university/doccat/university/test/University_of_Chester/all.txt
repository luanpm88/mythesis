established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <strong>University of Chester</strong> is a <a>university</a> based in the city of <a>Chester</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The University, based on a main <a>campus</a> in Chester and a smaller campus in <a>Warrington</a>, offers a range of <a>foundation</a>, <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> courses, as well as undertaking <a>academic research</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University was founded as Chester Diocesan Training College in 1839 by a distinguished group of local leading figures in the <a>Church of England</a>, including future <a>Prime Ministers</a> <a>William Ewart Gladstone</a> and the <a>14th Earl of Derby</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the UK's first purpose-built <a>teacher training college</a>, which makes it one of the longest established <a>higher education</a> institutions in the country.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1842, Gladstone opened the College's original buildings for its first intake of ten male student teachers on the Parkgate Road site, just outside the City Walls, that the University occupies today.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1921, Chester formally became an affiliated college of the <a>University of Liverpool</a> From then on, the College continued to grow steadily.
established$$$@@@%%%By the 1960s,  as the UK was massively expanding its higher education capacity in reaction to the <a>Robbins Report</a>, the College was considered as a possible candidate for university status.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%These proposals, however, weren't followed through.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>The College continued to expand.
established$$$@@@%%%Women were first admitted in 1961.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1963, the government renamed teacher training colleges to colleges of education, so Chester's name became Chester College of Education in 1963.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1974, the number of courses was expanded beyond teacher education to include <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees.
former_names$$$@@@%%%To reflect its wider remit, the College was renamed Chester College of Higher Education.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 1990s, The School of Nursing and Midwifery (now the Faculty of Health and Social Care) was established.
established$$$@@@%%%This was followed by the right to award its own research degrees in 2007 and, following the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, a significant proportion of the University&#x2019;s research was declared to be of international quality, with a proportion of 'World Leading' research in History (15%), English, Sports Studies, and Drama (each 5%).</p>
