<p>The <strong>University of Chester</strong> is a <a>university</a> based in the city of <a>Chester</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>.
The University, based on a main <a>campus</a> in Chester and a smaller campus in <a>Warrington</a>, offers a range of <a>foundation</a>, <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> courses, as well as undertaking <a>academic research</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University was founded as Chester Diocesan Training College in 1839 by a distinguished group of local leading figures in the <a>Church of England</a>, including future <a>Prime Ministers</a> <a>William Ewart Gladstone</a> and the <a>14th Earl of Derby</a>.
It was the UK's first purpose-built <a>teacher training college</a>, which makes it one of the longest established <a>higher education</a> institutions in the country.
In 1842, Gladstone opened the College's original buildings for its first intake of ten male student teachers on the Parkgate Road site, just outside the City Walls, that the University occupies today.</p>
<p>In 1921, Chester formally became an affiliated college of the <a>University of Liverpool</a> From then on, the College continued to grow steadily.
By the 1960s,  as the UK was massively expanding its higher education capacity in reaction to the <a>Robbins Report</a>, the College was considered as a possible candidate for university status.
Women were first admitted in 1961.
In 1963, the government renamed teacher training colleges to colleges of education, so Chester's name became Chester College of Education in 1963.
In 1974, the number of courses was expanded beyond teacher education to include <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees.
<p>In the early 1990s, The School of Nursing and Midwifery (now the Faculty of Health and Social Care) was established.
This was followed by the right to award its own research degrees in 2007 and, following the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, a significant proportion of the University&#x2019;s research was declared to be of international quality, with a proportion of 'World Leading' research in History (15%), English, Sports Studies, and Drama (each 5%).</p>
