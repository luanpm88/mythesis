<p><strong>Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology</strong> (Formerly known as the College of Aeronautics, previously the Academy of Aeronautics and originally founded as the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics) is a specialized college located adjacent to <a>LaGuardia Airport</a> in <a>Elmhurst</a>, <a>Queens County, New York</a>.
It was founded in <a>Newark, New Jersey</a> in 1932, and moved to New York in 1940.
The Aviation Training Institute at Vaughn offers the <a>Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) Airframe and Powerplant <a>maintenance certificate</a>.
The institution is also designated by the FAA as a Collegiate Training Institute and offers a non-degree <a>air traffic control</a> program for those wishing to pursue a career in this field.</p>
<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p>In 1932, Charles S. &#x201c;Casey&#x201d; Jones, a pioneer aviator and aviation company executive, foresaw the need for highly trained technicians to design, build and service aircraft and engines.
George A. Vaughn Jr. and Lee D. Warrender joined with Casey Jones in founding the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics, the predecessor of the Academy of Aeronautics, and as of September 1986, the College of Aeronautics.
Effective September 1, 2004, the Board of Regents of the state of New York approved the institution changing its name from the College of Aeronautics to Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology.</p>
<p>Mayor <a>Fiorello Henry La Guardia</a> laid the cornerstone of the Academy building in 1940, shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport.
Mayor LaGuardia wanted an aviation school to teach and train young people in the aviation technologies at his new airport.
At the time, his friend and flying comrade of <a>World War I</a>, Charles (&#x201c;Casey&#x201d;) S.
Jones, was operating the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics near Newark Airport.
In early 1940, the mayor convinced Casey to establish a school near LaGuardia airport, across the Grand Central Parkway.
It was founded by Jones, a well known racing pilot of the 1920s, <a>George Augustus Vaughn, Jr.</a>, second ranking ace of WW I, and Lee D. Warrender, an aeronautical engineer.
Following WW II, the Casey Jones school was consolidated with the Academy of Aeronautics, and returned to the civilian aviation industry.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1964, the Academy of Aeronautics conferred associate in applied science degrees for the first time.
In 1996, the College completely revised its curricula offering, resulting in nine new academic programs, including for the first time, the bachelor of science and an associate degree in flight.On May 5, 1998, a state-of-the-art  addition to the building complex was completed.
<p>In 2010 a  mural depicting early aviation that had been painted by <a>Aline Rhonie Hofheimer</a> in hangar F at <a>Roosevelt Field</a> was transferred to Vaughn and will be displayed following renovations.</p>
Vaughn was ranked in the first tier among such institutions as <a>Cooper Union</a> in Manhattan and the <a>United States Coast Guard Academy</a> in New London, Connecticut, both of which focus on undergraduate education but grant fewer than half of their degrees in liberal arts disciplines.
Vaughn was relisted in the <em>US News &amp; World Report</em> ranking for 2010.</p>
<h4>One of 31 Aviation Colleges Selected by the FAA to Recommend Graduates</h4>
<p>The Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program is a partnership between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology to provide the academic preparation necessary for students interested in air traffic control careers.&lt;ref
name=&quot;faa&quot;/&gt; Vaughn's air traffic control college is one of 31 aviation colleges in the country selected by the FAA to participate in this program that allows the air traffic control college to recommend its graduates to the FAA for hire as air traffic controllers.&lt;ref
<h4>Vaughn College and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</h4>
<p>Vaughn College and The <a>Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a> have a long association of mutual interest in the aviation industry&#x2014; an industry that is a vital economic driver for the New York metropolitan region.
The Port supports Vaughn in a myriad of ways, from providing funding for the annual Women in Aviation Day to employing interns.
The college offers a master degree in Airport Management.
<p>The current library, like the old building to which it is attached, both have a 1940&#x2019;s appearance.
The library has the latest in computer technology, modern management, flight training and engineering materials.
Vaughn will begin work on the new library in the summer of 2010 with an expected completion date of late 2011.
A large new classroom &amp; administration building was completed in 1998, and the college&#x2019;s first residence hall with a capacity of 200 beds, was completed in 2007.
Tuition and fees average between $32,000 and $65,000 for a four year degree.</p>
<p>Prior to obtaining a four-year degree at Vaughn College in some degree programs, one has to complete an internship performing the role for which the student has studied.
Vaughn has close ties to many airports and airlines due in part to its close proximity to the local airports such as JFK and LGA in Queens, Westchester and Farmingdale in New York, Teterboro and Newark in New Jersey, and several nearby airports in Connecticut.</p>
<p>The management programs at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology includes general management, airline management and airport management.
The field of airport management is a unique discipline with its roots in general business, but driven by the high-tech world of aviation and transportation.
Students of the airport management degree program concentrate on subjects as diverse as wildlife hazards, eco-system management, airfield safety, and emergency planning and control.
The Bachelor of Science airport management degree was developed to provide students proficiency in all areas of airport operations.
The location of the College, adjacent to LaGuardia Airport, provides a learning environment unsurpassed with regard to activities, resources and personnel.
<p>Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology offers bachelor and associate degree programs in the field of technology including electronic engineering technology with an avionics concentration and electronic technology with a concentration in general electronics.
The mechanical engineering technology program offers concentrations in computer-aided design and aeronautical options, as well as the associate in applied science degrees in computerized design and animated graphics and pre-engineering.</p>
<p>Vaughn College has designed degree programs for aviation school students interested in becoming professional pilots and other entry-level operations careers in the aviation industry, as well as related government agencies.
All aircraft operations (flight) degree programs offered by Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology include the academic liberal arts and sciences, as well as specific courses in flight that also count as the &quot;ground school&quot; portion of flight instruction.
