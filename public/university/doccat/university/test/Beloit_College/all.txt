type$$$@@@%%%<p> <strong>Beloit College</strong> is a private coeducational <a>liberal arts</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Beloit, Wisconsin</a>, <a>USA</a>.
image_size$$$@@@%%%It is a member of the <a>Associated Colleges of the Midwest</a>, and has an enrollment of roughly 1,300 <a>undergraduate</a> students.
established$$$@@@%%%Beloit is the oldest continuously operated college in Wisconsin, and has the oldest building of any college northwest of <a>Chicago</a> in continuous academic use.
established$$$@@@%%%Beloit has gained national attention after its inclusion in Loren Pope's book, <em>40 Colleges That Change Lives</em>, which identifies schools having two essential elements: &quot;A familial sense of communal enterprise that gets students heavily involved in cooperative rather than competitive learning, and a faculty of scholars devoted to helping young people develop their powers, mentors who often become their valued friends&quot;.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Founding</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Beloit College was founded by the group Friends for Education, which was started by seven pioneers from <a>New England</a> who, soon after their arrival in <a>Wisconsin Territory</a>, agreed that a college needed to be established.
established$$$@@@%%%The group raised funds for a college in their new town and convinced the territorial <a>legislature</a> to enact the charter for Beloit College on February 2, 1846.
established$$$@@@%%%The first building (then called Middle College) was built in 1847, and it remains in operation today.
established$$$@@@%%%Classes began in the fall of 1847, with the first degrees awarded in 1851.</p>
