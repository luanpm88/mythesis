Beloit is the oldest continuously operated college in Wisconsin, and has the oldest building of any college northwest of <a>Chicago</a> in continuous academic use.
Beloit has gained national attention after its inclusion in Loren Pope's book, <em>40 Colleges That Change Lives</em>, which identifies schools having two essential elements: &quot;A familial sense of communal enterprise that gets students heavily involved in cooperative rather than competitive learning, and a faculty of scholars devoted to helping young people develop their powers, mentors who often become their valued friends&quot;.</p>
<p>Beloit College was founded by the group Friends for Education, which was started by seven pioneers from <a>New England</a> who, soon after their arrival in <a>Wisconsin Territory</a>, agreed that a college needed to be established.
The group raised funds for a college in their new town and convinced the territorial <a>legislature</a> to enact the charter for Beloit College on February 2, 1846.
The first building (then called Middle College) was built in 1847, and it remains in operation today.
Classes began in the fall of 1847, with the first degrees awarded in 1851.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first president of Beloit was a <a>Yale University</a> graduate, Aaron Lucius Chapin, who served as president from December, 1849 until 1886.</p>
<p>Although independent today, Beloit College was historically, though unofficially,  associated with the <a>Congregationalist</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The college remained very small for almost its entire first century with enrollment topping 1,000 students only with the influx of <a>World War II</a> veterans in 1945-1946.
The &quot;Beloit Plan&quot;, a year-round curriculum introduced in 1964, comprising three full terms and a &quot;field term&quot; of off-campus study, brought the college national attention.
<p>One of the campus Indian effigy mounds, in the shape of a <a>turtle</a>, inspired Beloit's symbol (and unofficial mascot).</p>
<p>Beloit College's curriculum retains many aspects of the &quot;Beloit Plan&quot; from the 1960s.
The college's reputation in geology is largely based on Roy Chapman Andrews' expeditions, as well several pioneering geologists of the nineteenth century, including <a>T.
In the <a>Association for Computing Machinery</a> annual programming competition in 1990, Beloit students placed 11th and in 1991, 19th.
<p>In 2011, Beloit was ranked both 55 overall and a &quot;Best Value&quot; in the category of National Liberal Arts Colleges by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>, and it ranked 125 of the top 600 schools by <em><a>Forbes</a></em> in 2010.
<p>  In the 2006 college rankings by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', Beloit was shortlisted for &quot;Study Abroad&quot; (56% of students participate) and &quot;First-Year Initiative&quot;.
In 1985 the complementary <em>Beloit Fiction Journal</em> began, publishing an annual collection of short contemporary fiction every year since.
The establishment of the Mackey Chair in Creative Writing has brought a new nationally-known author to campus annually for several years, including <a>Billy Collins</a>, <a>Bei Dao</a>, <a>Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, <a>Amy Hempel</a>, <a>Denise Levertov</a>, and <a>Robert Stone</a>.
Beloit biology faculty member, John Jungck, along with Nils S. Peterson, CEO of From the Heart Software, co-founded and run the BioQUEST, and Brock Spencer maintains ChemLinks.
Beloit has had a faculty and student exchange program with <a>Fudan University</a> in <a>China</a> since the 1980s.</p>
The Psychology Department started with Guy Allen Tawney, a student of <a>Wilhelm Wundt</a>, who taught from 1897 to 1906.
<p>The Beloit College Geology Department continues a tradition in geology that began with T. C. Chamberlin more than a century ago.
Today the department combines a course load with mandatory field methods and research.
The department is a member of the <a>Keck Geology Consortium</a>, a research collaboration of several similar colleges across the United States, including <a>Amherst College</a>, <a>Pomona College</a>, and <a>Washington and Lee University</a>.
The <a>Logan Museum of Anthropology</a> and the <a>Wright Museum of Art</a> were both founded in the late nineteenth century.
The Logan Museum, accredited by the <a>American Association of Museums</a>, curates over 300,000 ethnographic and archaeological objects from 122 countries and over 450 cultural groups.
The Wright Museum's holdings of over 8,000 objects include a large collection of original prints and Asian art.
The Beloit College campus also houses two sculptures by artist <a>Siah Armajani</a>, his &quot;Gazebo for One Anarchist: <a>Emma Goldman</a> 1991&quot; and &quot;The Beloit College Poetry Garden.&quot;
<p>Since 1998, the college has produced the annual &quot;<a>Mindset List</a>,&quot; written by Professor Tom McBride, summarizing pop culture references that are allegedly meaningless to incoming college <a>freshmen</a>.</p>
<p>Beloit College completed a  Center for the Sciences in the fall of 2008.
The building was designed to achieve a minimum Silver Level LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building certification and was ultimately awarded platinum level certification.
It also won a Design Excellence Honor Award in Interior Architecture from the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) on October 30, 2009.</p>
Resident Assistants, employed by the Residential Life office, help to maintain campus safety and encourage responsible behavior.
<p>Beloit College has a <a>frisbee</a> golf course contained almost entirely within the grounds of the college.
<p>In April 2006, Beloit College students broke the world record for the longest game of Ultimate  Frisbee by playing for over 72 hours.</p>
