<p>  <strong>Bethune-Cookman University</strong> or <strong>B-CU</strong> (as it is called as of Feb. 14, 2007) is a private <a>historically black university</a> in <a>Daytona Beach, Florida</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>Mary McLeod Bethune</a> founded the Bethune Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in 1904.
The school underwent several stages of growth and development through the years and in 1923, it merged with the Cookman Institute of Jacksonville, Florida and became a co-ed high school.
A year later in 1924, it became affiliated with the Methodist Church.
By 1931, the school had become a junior college.</p>
<p>The school became a four-year college in 1941 when the <a>Florida Board of Education</a> approved a 4-year baccalaureate program in Liberal Arts and Teacher Education.
The name was changed to Bethune-Cookman College.</p>
<p>On February 14, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved the name Bethune-Cookman University after the institution established its first graduate program.</p>
<p>In October 2010 the <a>American Association of University Professors</a> accused the university administration of improperly dismissing tenured members of the faculty -- some for alleged sexual harassment (but, in the opinion of the AAUP, without due process), others for &quot;budgetary reasons&quot; but without a declaration of &quot;financial exigency&quot;.
The university responded saying that the AAUP report contained errors and a one-sided view.</p>
Bethune retired in 1942 at which time James E. Colston became president until 1946 when Mrs. Bethune resumed the presidency for a year.</p>
Under his tenure the college was accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1970, joined the <a>United Negro College Fund</a> and other academic and professional organizations.
Major fields of study increased from 12 in 1974 to 37 by 2003.
In addition, seven continuing education centers for students began operating throughout the state.
<p>Trudie Kibbe Reed, Ed.D., was appointed to the presidency in August 2004 by the Board of Trustees.
Since beginning her tenure, the university has a number of campus improvements including construction of the Center for Civic Engagement, the L. Gale Lemerand School of Nursing, the creation of the Alexis Pugh and Eugene Zimmerman Scholarship houses, and the provision of a university-owned house as an alumni center.
Dr. Reed also established the university's first graduate program under the School of Graduate &amp; Professional Studies.
The new program is a Master of Science in Transformative Leadership.</p>
<p> Bethune-Cookman University is a small, private, co-educational, and residential institution.
The university meets its commitment to excellence through expanding and modifying academic programs and innovative curricular offerings by preparing students to meet the demands of the future.
<p> Bethune-Cookman University is a member of the <a>Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference</a> and participates in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division 1-AA</a>.
The Wildcats have 29 MEAC titles; 13 in baseball, 1 in bowling, 1 in men's cross country, 2 in women's cross country, 3 in football, 2 in women's indoor track and field, 5 in softball and 2 in women's tennis.</p>
<p>B-CU has an intense in-state rivalry with Florida A&amp;M University.
Today, they meet annually in the <a>Florida Classic</a>, a regular-season, neutral-Bethune-Cookman's first win came a year later, 12-0 in 1926.
In 2000, Mervyl S. Melendez, (B-CU alumnus) was named as the head coach for the Wildcats' baseball program.
In 2007, the Wildcats finished the regular season with a record of 33-25, with notable wins against both University of Tennessee and Stetson University, as well as ranking #1 in the 2007 Black College Baseball poll.</p>
<p>Brian Jenkins (Native Floridian) was named the tenth head football coach at Bethune-Cookman University on December 21, 2009.
He comes to B-CU from Rutgers where he served as an Assistant Coach.
