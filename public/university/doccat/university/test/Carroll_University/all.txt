established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Carroll University claims to be the oldest college in Wisconsin, however this claim is also held by <a>Beloit College</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prairieville Academy, which eventually became Carroll College (and subsequently Carroll University), was founded in 1841 by <a>Increase Lapham</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Three years later, in summer of 1844, the genesis for Beloit College came in the form of a group of New Englanders calling themselves &quot;Friends of Education,&quot; who gathered to discuss the formation of a &quot;frontier college.&quot;</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The charter for Carroll &#x2013; named for <a>Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, Maryland, a signer of the <a>United States Declaration of Independence</a> &#x2013; was passed into law by the Wisconsin Territorial Legislation on January 31, 1846.
established$$$@@@%%%Beloit's charter followed shortly on February 2, giving rise to Carroll's claim to be the oldest four-year institution in Wisconsin.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Beloit's claim is often phrased &quot;the oldest college in the state in continuous operation,&quot; with a particular emphasis on the &quot;continuous operation&quot; aspect.
established$$$@@@%%%During the 1860s, the <a>American Civil War</a> and financial difficulty caused Carroll to temporarily suspend operations, while Beloit has offered classes continuously since 1847.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2009, Carroll was ranked 175th out of 600 by <a>Forbes</a> on their list of America's Best Colleges.</p>
