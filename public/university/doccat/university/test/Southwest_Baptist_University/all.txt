established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Abner S. Ingman and James R. Maupin founded Southwest Baptist College in 1878 in Lebanon, Missouri.
students$$$@@@%%%The Lebanon campus originally had an enrollment of 60 students and six faculty.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The college lasted one year before the city decided they no longer wanted it.
established$$$@@@%%%When news got out that the college would be moving, the communities of Aurora, Monett, and Bolivar in southwest Missouri attempted to attract the college.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1879, the state of Missouri chartered the school and it moved to Bolivar, Missouri.
established$$$@@@%%%The college went through many financial difficulties in the early part of the Twentieth Century.
established$$$@@@%%%The college remained closed from 1910-1913 due to a fire that destroyed the entire campus, until Missouri Baptists and area supporters helped it open again as a two-year junior college.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On June 1, 1910, at 11:00 am., the fire that would destroy the campus started.
established$$$@@@%%%The fire broke out under suspect circumstances, leading some to believe arson was the cause.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Bolivar citizen firefighters tried to put out the fire, but the water supply ran dry and at 2:00 pm the fire engulfed the whole campus.
doctoral$$$@@@%%%Losses were estimated at $20,000.
established$$$@@@%%%The college was rebuilt, and reopened in 1913.</p>
website$$$@@@%%%<h4>Campus history</h4>

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Wayne and Betty Gott Educational Center was renovated in 1998 to accommodate classroom needs.
