<h2>History</h2>
<p>Abner S. Ingman and James R. Maupin founded Southwest Baptist College in 1878 in Lebanon, Missouri.
When news got out that the college would be moving, the communities of Aurora, Monett, and Bolivar in southwest Missouri attempted to attract the college.
In 1879, the state of Missouri chartered the school and it moved to Bolivar, Missouri.
The college went through many financial difficulties in the early part of the Twentieth Century.
The college remained closed from 1910-1913 due to a fire that destroyed the entire campus, until Missouri Baptists and area supporters helped it open again as a two-year junior college.</p>
<p>On June 1, 1910, at 11:00 am., the fire that would destroy the campus started.
The fire broke out under suspect circumstances, leading some to believe arson was the cause.
The college was rebuilt, and reopened in 1913.</p>
<p>When it reopened in 1913 as a junior college, Southwest Baptist College consisted of four buildings, three of which still stand on the Stufflebaum campus.
<p>On March 26, 1962 A fire destroyed Pike Auditorium.
Students and townspeople saved eight pianos and almost all of the sports equipment from the locker rooms of the multipurpose building at that time.
Pike Auditorium was the only building destroyed by the fire.
The fire became a turning point in the history of Southwest Baptist.
This farmland expanded into the Shoffner Campus on which Southwest Baptist University resides today.</p>
<p>The Shoffner campus, located approximately a quarter-mile south of Stufflebaum campus, was started in 1962 with the opening of Beasley Hall.
<p>In 1981, the Gene Taylor National Free Enterprise Center was opened to facilitate the College of Business and Computer Science.
This was the same year in which Southwest Baptist College became Southwest Baptist University.
In 1989, the Sells Administrative Building was completed to accommodate the growing administrative department of Southwest Baptist University.</p>
<p>In 1992, the Wheeler Science Center opened, giving the science department a facility capable of housing hundreds of students.
<p>In 1995, SBU agreed with St. John's School of Nursing, a traditionally <a>Catholic</a> institution, to form St. John's School of Nursing of Southwest Baptist University located in <a>Springfield, Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>The Wayne and Betty Gott Educational Center was renovated in 1998 to accommodate classroom needs.
The campus library moved to what is now the Jester Learning and Performance Center, and was renamed the Harriet K. Hutchens Library, which opened in 1996.
The rest of the Jester Learning and Performance Center was completed in 2001.
It currently houses the Davis-Newport theatre and the Bob R. Derryberry School of Communication Arts.</p>
