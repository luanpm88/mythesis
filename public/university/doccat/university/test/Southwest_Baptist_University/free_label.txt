These changes are as minor from changing light bulbs, to fixing heating and cooling units, to complete renovations of buildings.</p>
<p>In the 2008 spring semester, Southwest Baptist University will begin renovating three Bolivar campus buildings.
The three main sites to be renovated are Hutchens Library, Pike Auditorium, and the swimming pool inside the Meyer Wellness and Sports Center.
The Hutchens Library renovations will be made towards using the existing floor space on the second floor.
