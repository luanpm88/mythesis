<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The University building in 1890</a> The University of Belgrade was established in 1808 as the <em>Belgrade Higher School</em> () by <a>Dositej Obradovi&#x0107;</a>, Serbian key figure in the <a>Age of Enlightenment</a>.
It was the highest ranking educational institution in <a>Serbia</a> between 1808 and 1905, as  the first Higher School (1808-1813), The Belgrade Lyceum (1838-1863), and the second Higher School (1863-1905).
It was initially located at the <a>Countess Ljubica's Residence</a> building and then moved to another significant site in Belgrade, the <a>Captain Mi&#x0161;a&#x2019;s Mansion</a>, today's seat of the university.</p>
<p>The Higher School (also known as the <em>Great School</em> or <em>Great Academy</em> of Belgrade) was established as the successor of the Lyceum and was a combination of a <a>classical gymnasium</a> and a <a>college</a>, and as such developed into the University of Belgrade.
Under the law, it was defined as a &#x201c;scientific institute for higher and professional education&#x201d;.
The <a>Minister of Education</a> had control over this institution and it was managed by the <a>Rector</a> (elected by the monarch) and Academic Council.
<p>During its early history it had three departments: <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Engineering</a> and <a>Law</a>.
The Higher School formally became the University of Belgrade through the Law on the University from February 27, 1905.
In addition to the Philosophy, Law and Electrical Engineering departments, this Law introduced the <a>Orthodox</a> <a>Theology</a> and <a>Medical</a> schools.</p>
<p>In the early 19th century, the studies of law lasted three years and, in addition to general subjects, the curriculum included comparative and state (constitutional) law, international law, criminal law and judicial procedure.
Since 1853, the legal education became independent from the studies of philosophy and from 1863 the legal education in Serbia lasted four years.</p>
The lectures were held by well-known professors, who have earned their diplomas in <a>Austria</a>, <a>Germany</a> and <a>France</a> (<a>Jovan Sterija Popovi&#x0107;</a>, <a>Josif Pan&#x010d;i&#x0107;</a>, <a>&#x0110;ura Dani&#x010d;i&#x0107;</a>, and others).
During the 1850&#x2019;s, the Philosophy (General) Department developed into a particular college.
The University of Belgrade's <a>Faculty of Philosophy</a> is the today's continuation of this department.</p>
<p>The first academic lecture on <a>electrical engineering</a> in <a>Serbia</a> was held in 1894.
Professor <a>Stevan Markovi&#x0107;</a> was the first lecturer and founder of the Engineering Department at the Higher School.
Only four years later, Professor Markovi&#x0107; also established the first Serbian electrical engineering laboratory.
Since then, this academic discipline has been studied at the Higher School and the University of Belgrade.
The first diplomas in this field were given in 1922.</p>
Maksimovi&#x0107;]] graduated from the Belgrade University in 1923]] The University of Belgrade witnessed a massive growth and expansion in the years before the <a>Second World War</a> and especially after the founding of the <a>second Yugoslavia</a>.
The first woman graduated from the University of Belgrade's <a>Law School</a> in 1914.</p>
In the socialist Yugoslavia, the University was expanded, but was also exposed to state and ideological influence.
It has also been the driving force for the establishment of almost all other universities in today's <a>Serbia</a>, <a>Montenegro</a>, <a>Republic of Macedonia</a> and several universities in <a>Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the quality of university programs deteriorated as a consequence of the political instability in the country and the subsequent wars of Yugoslavia.
There was a lack of financial resources and the quality dropped significantly.
During the <a>Milosevic</a> government in Serbia, the University had to face external political pressure and the lack of academic and administrative autonomy.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the University of Belgrade became an internationally recognized center of the political opposition in Serbia.
Massive anti-government protests were staged by the Belgrade students and professors.
<p>Since 2000, the University of Belgrade has taken important steps and has revitalized and improved the facilities and its teaching quality.
There have been many reforms in higher education of the country.
The University has made great efforts since then to improve the internal structure and has become a signatory of the <a>Bologna declaration</a>.
