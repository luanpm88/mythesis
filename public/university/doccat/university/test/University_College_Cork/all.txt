established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|The &quot;long hall&quot; and clock tower of the UCC quadrangle</a> Queen's College, Cork was founded by the provisions of an act which enabled <a>Queen Victoria</a> to endow new colleges for the &quot;Advancement of Learning in Ireland&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%Under the powers of this act, the three colleges of <a>Belfast</a>, Cork and <a>Galway</a> were incorporated on 30 December 1845.
established$$$@@@%%%The college opened in 1849 with 23 professors and 181 students and a year later became part of the <a>Queen's University of Ireland</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The original site chosen for the College was particularly appropriate in that it is believed to have had a connection with the <a>patron saint</a> of Cork, <a>Saint Finbarr</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%His monastery and school of learning were close by at Gill Abbey Rock and the mill attached to the monastery is thought to have stood on the bank of the south channel of the <a>River Lee</a>, which runs through the College lower grounds.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%This association is also reflected in the College motto &quot;Where Finbarr Taught, Let <a>Munster</a> Learn&quot; which is also the current university motto.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On this site (on a hill overlooking the valley of the Lee), the Tudor Gothic quadrangle and early campus buildings were built by <a>Deane</a> and Woodward.
established$$$@@@%%%Over the coming years the College gained a standing for excellence in various fields, including mathematics, medicine and the humanities.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The medical buildings were built in stages between 1860 and 1880, and the faculty quickly gained a reputation for the quality of its graduates.
established$$$@@@%%%The first two women to graduate in medicine in Ireland did so in 1898 (this was notable as it was more than 20 years before women were permitted to sit for medicine at the <a>University of Oxford</a>).</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the following century, the Irish Universities Act (1908) formed the <a>National University of Ireland</a>, consisting of the three constituent colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the college was given the status of a <a>university college</a> as <em>University College, Cork</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Universities Act, 1997, made the university college a constituent university of the National University and made the constituent university a full university for all purposes except the awarding of degrees and diplomas which remains the sole remit of the National University.</p>
