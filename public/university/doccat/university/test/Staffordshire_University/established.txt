<p> <strong>Staffordshire University</strong> is a <a>university</a> with its main <a>campus</a> based in the <a>city</a> of <a>Stoke-on-Trent</a>, and with other campuses in <a>Stafford</a> and <a>Lichfield</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1901 industrialist Alfred Bolton acquired a  site on what is now College Road and in 1906 mining classes began there.
In 1914 the building now known as the Cadman Building was officially opened as the Central School of Science and Technology by Rt.
Hon <a>J A Pease</a> MP, President of the Board of Education.
A frieze over the entrance depicts potters and miners.</p>
<p>In 1915 a department was established for the commercial production of <a>Seger cone</a>s (used to measure and control the temperatures of ceramic furnaces) based upon research completed by the principal, Dr <a>Joseph Mellor</a>.
Grants from the <a>Carnegie UK Trust</a>, the second in 1924, were used to develop the ceramics library and in 1926 the name of the institution was changed to North Staffordshire Technical College.
By 1931 extensions to the Cadman Building ran along Station Road and housed the Mining Department.
A grant was awarded from the Miners&#x2019; Welfare Fund to fund the building work.
<p>In 1939 new engineering workshops were occupied for the first time and the land opposite the Cadman Building was purchased.
By 1950 Victoria Road changed its name to College Road and the site now extended over .
The Mellor Building and &#x2018;Experimental Production Block&#x2019; (now Dwight Building) were constructed giving the North Staffordshire College of Technology by 1960.</p>
<p>Various faculty movements and further building work resulted in <strong>North Staffordshire <a>Polytechnic</a></strong> being formed in 1971 with the merger of <a>Stoke-on-Trent College of Art</a>, <a>North Staffordshire College of Technology</a> (both based in Stoke-on-Trent), and  Staffordshire College of Technology in <a>Stafford</a>.
The Polytechnic later (in 1977) absorbed a teacher training facility in <a>Madeley</a>.</p>
<p>The Polytechnic was able to develop traditional strengths of the component institutions, e.g.
<a>ceramics</a> (Stoke-on-Trent), <a>computing</a> (Stafford) and <a>sports education</a> (Madeley).
However, the mining department closed as result of the decline of <a>coal mining</a> in the 1980s.
New subjects were developed, for example, in the 1970s North Staffordshire Polytechnic was amongst only a handful of third-level institutions in the UK to offer International Relations as a dedicated degree.
The 1992 UK government <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> placed the International Relations Department as the highest-rated in the institution.</p>
In 1992 it became Staffordshire University, one of the <a>New Universities</a>.</p>
The building shown is the former technical college, opened 1914</a></p>
<p>The Two main campuses (Stoke-on Trent and Stafford) and the Lichfield campus all have purpose built Business Villages; which consist of fully furnished small office spaces with full internet access included.</p>
<p>The main campus is in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, and primarily offers law, business, sciences, applied computing, arts, design, journalism and media production courses.
A new Science and Technology facility is under construction as part of a major redevelopment adjacent to <a>Stoke-on-Trent railway station</a>.
A large section of the campus is supported by AirNet, the university's free wireless connection.</p>
<p>A public film theatre is situated on the side of the Flaxman building on College Road, and shows mainstream and independent films on a regular basis to an audience of up to 180 people, as well as being used for large lectures.
In 2006, a new TV studio facility was opened by former BBC Director General <a>Greg Dyke</a> in the Arts, Media and Design faculty building on College Road, Stoke.</p>
<p>Nursing courses are taught just around the corner from Beaconside on Blackheath Lane following the integration into the University in 1995 of the Shropshire and Staffordshire College of Nursing and Midwifery, which also has bases in <a>Shrewsbury</a>, <a>Telford</a> and <a>Oswestry</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, in partnership with Tamworth and Lichfield College, the University opened a newly built campus in Lichfield quite near <a>Lichfield City railway station</a>.</p>
<p>The University has around 5000 students studying overseas on Staffordshire University awards in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Greece, Spain, Nigeria, France and Macedonia.</p>
<p>The University is seeking to develop in partnership with <a>Stoke-on-Trent College</a> and <a>Stoke-on-Trent 6th Form College</a> and with the co-operation of the local education authority and the city council, a &quot;University Quarter&quot; in the urban area to the  north-east of <a>Stoke-on-Trent railway station</a> that is already home to the University and the two colleges.
The vision is that the University Quarter (located between College Road and Leek Road) will attract both students and developers and become a gateway to the city and to the region.
<h3>Halls of Residence</h3>
<p>The University offers guaranteed accommodation for all first year students, provided the University is their firm UCAS choice.
<p>The Stafford campus has its own halls of residence, Stafford Court, comprising over 264 en-suite single study bedrooms and 290 single study bedrooms with shared facilities.
The various houses take their names from villages in Staffordshire: <a>Brocton</a>, <a>Derrington</a>, <a>Eccleshall</a>, <strong><a>Gnosall</a></strong>, <a>Haughton</a>, <a>Knightley</a>, <a>Levedale</a>, <a>Milwich</a>, <a>Norbury</a>, <a>Ranton</a>, <a>Shugborough</a> and <a>Weston</a>.
A separate block of larger flats, named after the village of <a>Yarlet</a> (previously Beckett Hall), is also on the same site.
All accommodation on the Stafford Campus has 24/7 Security with Stafford Court benefitting from secure access to the accommodation via a two-way intercom system and students can book the &quot;Aston Common Room&quot; for social events at no cost to them.
<p>Students in Stafford On-Campus accommodation have free access to the Internet, via &quot;ResNet&quot;, which also allows access to the university network.
A handset is provided in every room.
Beaconside contains 54 semi-detached houses arranged around a communal green area, and provides 161 reasonably sized bedrooms.
The shared-bathroom accommodation was sponsored by various local potteries, and halls are therefore named after them, for example Royal Doulton, Coalport, Minton, Spode, <a>Aynsley</a> and <a>Wedgwood Halls</a>.
<p>The on campus en-suite accommodation is contained within Clarice Cliff Court, comprising of 7 halls of about 30 students over three floors, each named after female ceramicists: Rachel Bishop, Eve Midwinter, Jessie Van Hallen, Charlotte Rhead, Jessie Tait, Millicent Taplin and Star Wedgwood.
Along with the halls and en-suite, Staffordshire University also offers 32 houses known as the Leek Road Houses which inhabit up to 6 people each.
<p>Each of the halls has a large car park, free for students to use.</p>
<p>Private sector housing in Stoke-on-Trent is very affordable with prices ranging from &#x00a3;38-&#x00a3;55 a week (exclusive of bills) for rooms in shared basic terraced houses.</p>
<p>Although the area may appear slightly run down and shabby most of the private accommodation is very good and provides students with good access to the University facilities.
The proximity of Shelton to the University and the large quantity of student accommodation has effectively turned it into a mini-student village.</p>
The cost of College Court is higher than that of houses in Shelton, but as all bills are included it is actually cheaper than Clarice Cliffe and the majority of Shelton terraces.</p>
<p>The University is noted for its science departments; in 2002 <a>Psychology</a> was among the top ten in the country, while Molecular Biochemistry and Organismal Biosciences were rated as 'excellent' by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.
The Science Faculty together with most of the University also does consistently well in the <a>National Student Survey</a> and measures of graduate level employment after graduation.</p>
<p>The School of Computing was originally situated at Blackheath Lane on the edge of Stafford in <a>GEC</a>'s former Nelson Research Laboratory.
It offered one of the first <a>BSc</a> courses in computing in the <a>United Kingdom</a> and its first major computer was a second hand <a>DEUCE</a>.
The School of Computing has now moved to a purpose-built building on the Beaconside campus and the newly refurbished Brindley Building in Stoke, and continues to offer one of the best respected computing degrees in the UK.
The Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Technology (FCET) is a <a>Cisco Networking Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The University was the first institution to introduce a single honours degree in Film, Television and Radio Studies in 1990.
A new Media Centre was opened by <a>Greg Dyke</a> in 2005, comprising radio studios, television news desk and broadcast journalist suite.
The Forensic theme is continued with a specialist Forensic Biology degree and on the Stafford Campus the Faculty of Computing Engineering and Technology was one of the first university faculties in the UK to offer undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the new field of Forensic Computing.</p>
<p>The university's world ranking is 1354 in 2010, according to webometrics.info.</p>
<p> Staffordshire University Students Union aims to represent students at the University.
Constitutionally it is governed by the student body via referendums, who annually elect a union council which is responsible for the organisation of the Union.
