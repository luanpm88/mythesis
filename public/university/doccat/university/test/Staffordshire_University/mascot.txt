The new extension also housed the library, which by now had 35,000 volumes.
These are split into two areas, one on College Road, and the other on Leek Road.
Calls within Halls are free.
The area has many houses which are used by students - each fairly big in size.
<p>Alternatively there are also the popular <a>College Court Halls</a> - which are privately run and operate in a similar way to halls.
The Halls are situated opposite to Hanley Park and are within close range to the University.
The Halls are also newer than most accommodation in the area ; they also provides students with a large common room with access to SKY television.
The day to day operation of the union is handled by five Sabbatical Officers and four non-portfolio Executive Officers, who are held to account by the Council.
