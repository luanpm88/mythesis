country$$$@@@%%%<p>[[Image:6 - Library.JPG|thumb|left|270px|[[Ned R. McWherter]] Library]]In 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted the General Education Bill.
established$$$@@@%%%This bill stated that three colleges be established within each <a>grand division</a> of the state and one additional school for African-American students.
established$$$@@@%%%After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for <a>West Tennessee</a>: <a>Jackson, Tennessee</a> and <a>Memphis, Tennessee</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for <a>West Tennessee</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives.
established$$$@@@%%%The other three schools established through the General Education Act are modern-day <a>East Tennessee State University</a>, <a>Middle Tennessee State University</a> and <a>Tennessee State University</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to the establishment of the West Tennessee Normal School pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the <em>University of Memphis.</em>
established$$$@@@%%%This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On September 10, 1912, West Tennessee Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1913 all departments of the earlier <em>University of Memphis,</em> except the <a>law school</a>, had been taken over by the State University.
established$$$@@@%%%After Mynders' death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%After Brister's resignation in 1918, Andrew A. Kincannon became president.
president$$$@@@%%%In 1924, Brister returned to his post as president of the school.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The name changed in 1925 to West Tennessee State Teachers College.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1931, the campus' first newspaper, <em>The Tiger Rag</em>, was established.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1959, five years after <a>Brown v. Board of Education</a> the University admitted its first black students.
established$$$@@@%%%Because <a>racial segregation</a> was the norm throughout the South at the time the Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University, their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny, but severe criticism from much of the local public.
established$$$@@@%%%Therefore, for their safety, and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, University administrators placed certain restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus.
nickname$$$@@@%%%They were to go only to their classes, not to any of the public places on campus, such as the cafeteria; and they were to leave the campus immediately after they had finished their last class.
established$$$@@@%%%These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public&#x2019;s focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the University.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Today, black students make up more than one-third of the campus student body and they participate fully in all campus activities.</p>

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Colors</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The University of Memphis' official school colors of blue and gray were selected by students in the first classes in the early 1900s.
established$$$@@@%%%Tradition holds that the colors, those of the opposing armies during the <a>American Civil War</a>, were chosen in commemoration of the reuniting of the country after that divisive conflict.
established$$$@@@%%%The student body thought that by picking the colors of the North and the South, the school would show a togetherness and unity among all students.</p>

nickname$$$@@@%%%Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors.</p>

former_names$$$@@@%%%During this event, several University students shouted, &quot;We fight like Tigers!&quot;

nickname$$$@@@%%%As time passed, the nickname &quot;Tigers&quot; was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown.
established$$$@@@%%%They continued to use &quot;the Blue and Gray&quot; when referring to the University.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Under Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis's football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers.
established$$$@@@%%%The team adopted a motto - &quot;Every Man a Tiger&quot; - and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points.
