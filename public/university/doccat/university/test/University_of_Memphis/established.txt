<h2>History</h2>
This bill stated that three colleges be established within each <a>grand division</a> of the state and one additional school for African-American students.
After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for <a>West Tennessee</a>: <a>Jackson, Tennessee</a> and <a>Memphis, Tennessee</a>.
Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for <a>West Tennessee</a>.
The other three schools established through the General Education Act are modern-day <a>East Tennessee State University</a>, <a>Middle Tennessee State University</a> and <a>Tennessee State University</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the establishment of the West Tennessee Normal School pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the <em>University of Memphis.</em>
This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law.
<p>On September 10, 1912, West Tennessee Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders.
By 1913 all departments of the earlier <em>University of Memphis,</em> except the <a>law school</a>, had been taken over by the State University.
After Mynders' death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place.
<p>The name changed in 1925 to West Tennessee State Teachers College.
In 1931, the campus' first newspaper, <em>The Tiger Rag</em>, was established.
In 1941, the school was changed to Memphis State College, when the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum.
Three years later, the first alumnus to become president, J. Millard (Jack) Smith, was appointed.
In 1957 the school received full <a>University</a> status, and changed its name accordingly.
<p>In 1959, five years after <a>Brown v. Board of Education</a> the University admitted its first black students.
Because <a>racial segregation</a> was the norm throughout the South at the time the Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University, their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny, but severe criticism from much of the local public.
Therefore, for their safety, and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, University administrators placed certain restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus.
These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public&#x2019;s focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the University.
In 1966, the school began awarding doctoral degrees.
Humphreys resigned as MSU president to become the first chancellor of the newly formed State University and Community College System, later renamed the Tennessee Board of Regents.
Also that year, the Memphis State Tiger men's <a>basketball</a> team reached the finals of the <a>NCAA</a> tournament, only to fall at the hands of a <a>UCLA</a> team led by future <a>NBA</a> star <a>Bill Walton</a> in the championship game in <a>St.
On July 1, 1994, after years of research and surveys, Memphis State University changed its name again, to the University of Memphis - a name change inspired by Ms. Christina Trinh, wife of former president Carpenter.</p>
Rawlins served for slightly over a decade; Dr. Ralph Faudree filled in as interim president for one year after Rawlins' retirement.

The University of Memphis campus is located approximately  east of downtown in the University District neighborhood of east Memphis.
It has an area of , although this figure does not include the law school in the former United States federal customshouse in downtown Memphis, which opened in January 2010.
The University of Memphis is located geographically at .
<p>Proponents of a more pedestrian-friendly campus have significantly increased the amount of green space and the number of walkways over the past several years, while maintaining a focus on the original historic architecture of the campus.</p>
<p>The University of Memphis campus is set out in a rectilinear format, planned as a geometric design similar to the <a>Jeffersonian</a> style of the <a>University of Virginia</a>.
According to the most recent master plan, the University is projected to expand and redevelop additional areas one block west of the main campus' current western boundary of Patterson St., making Highland Avenue the &quot;de facto&quot; entrance to the University.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Students walking in front of Manning Hall</a> <a>thumb|right|The FedEx Institute of Technology is a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, robotics, and intelligent systems.</a>
The first college buildings, including Scates Hall, Manning Hall, and the Administration Building, were erected in the early 1900s.
The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments, as well as those of the Physics and Astronomy departments of the College of Arts and Science, are located in the original areas of campus.
<a>thumb|left|The Administration Building at the University of Memphis</a> <a>thumb|left|Scates Hall, the oldest building on campus</a></p>
<p>Flanking the original area of campus to the east are the areas of major research for the life sciences and Engineering departments, including J.R. Smith Hall, the Life Sciences building and the Herff College of Engineering complex, as well as the Education department, residing in E.C. Ball Hall.
The <a>Ned R. McWherter</a> Library, a state-of-the art library facility and one of the premier research libraries of the Mid-South United States, takes up the eastern part of the campus adjacent to Dunavant Plaza and Emeriti Grove.</p>
Originally, in the north end of the campus, Norriswood Avenue was the northern boundary and was an actual street that ran through the campus.
The campus expanded into this area in the late 1960s &amp; early 1970s.</p>
<p>The western edge and southwest corner include Johnson Hall (comprising the Geography and Geology departments), Patterson Hall (housing the English department), Wilder Tower, Greek Row and the bulk of the University of Memphis residence halls.
As the University presses ahead with its planned expansion, many more facilities, pedestrian access and green space will also be created with the renovation and development of the currently-residential block east of Patterson Street in the University District neighborhood.</p>
The <a>Defense Contract Audit Agency</a> also operates its main training facility on the Park Avenue Campus.</p>
<p>In 2007, President Shirley Raines signed the American College and University President&#x2019;s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), which requires that the University become carbon neutral in the coming years.</p>

<p>Memphis received a grade of &quot;C&quot; on the 2009 Campus Sustainability Report Card published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.
<p>The publication is part of a tradition which began in 1931 as <em>The Tiger Rag</em>, a protest newspaper.
Since that time, the newspaper has been continuously published by University of Memphis students.
Even during World War II when paper and other resources were scarce, the newspaper published as a newsletter posted on bulletin boards around campus.</p>
<p>The name of the newspaper was changed to <em>The Helmsman</em> in 1972, and became <em>The Daily Helmsman</em> in 1981, when the newspaper began publishing four days a week.</p>
<p><em>The Helmsman</em> has won many honors over the years for reporting, photography and design, including awards given by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, Columbia University and the Southeastern Journalism Conference.
<p>The University of Memphis has accumulated numerous traditions over its long history as the flagship public research university within the Tennessee Board of Regents system.</p>
<p>The University of Memphis' official school colors of blue and gray were selected by students in the first classes in the early 1900s.
Tradition holds that the colors, those of the opposing armies during the <a>American Civil War</a>, were chosen in commemoration of the reuniting of the country after that divisive conflict.
The student body thought that by picking the colors of the North and the South, the school would show a togetherness and unity among all students.</p>
<p>The Mighty Sound of the South Band is the University's band.
The band performs at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band.
As one of the oldest institutions at the University, the Band partakes in many of the game day traditions.
The MSS is featured at nearly every campus-wide event, ranging from Freshman Convocation to the Homecoming Parade and Pep Rally.
The band has been featured on the nationally syndicated &quot;Mike &amp; Mandy&quot; Radio Show, and is a star attraction at the Bandmaster's Championship, a high school marching band contest administered by The University of Memphis Band Alumni Chapter.
TOM II has spent his life housed and cared for in private facilities provided and maintained by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard, an alumni booster organization.
With a price tag of over $300,000, raised entirely by the Tiger Guard, the habitat was widely regarded as the finest private facility in the nation, surpassing that of many zoos.
As one of only two Universities in America with a live Tiger mascot, The University of Memphis is unique in its Tiger Tradition.
<p>After being diagnosed with mouth cancer, TOM II was euthanized on October 15, 2008, at the age of 17.
<p>After the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade.
They continued to use &quot;the Blue and Gray&quot; when referring to the University.</p>
The team adopted a motto - &quot;Every Man a Tiger&quot; - and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points.
Go!&#x201d; the University of Memphis Tigers&#x2019; fight song.
The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1970s.</p>
