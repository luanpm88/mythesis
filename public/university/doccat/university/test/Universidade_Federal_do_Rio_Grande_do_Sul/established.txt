<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|UFRGS Entrance|200px</a> The university originated from <em>Escola de Farm&#x00e1;cia e Qu&#x00ed;mica</em> (<a>Pharmacy</a> and <a>Chemistry</a> School) in 1895, which expanded with the creation of <em>Escola de Engenharia</em> (College of <a>Engineering</a>) in 1896.
This was the flourishing of <a>higher education</a> in <a>Rio Grande do Sul</a>, and still at the end of the 19th century, the <a>Medicine</a> and <a>Law</a> schools were founded, the latter being the first <a>humanities</a> <a>tertiary education</a> school in the state.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned institutions were scattered about Porto Alegre until 1934, when <em>Universidade de Porto Alegre</em> (Porto Alegre University) was founded, initially composed by the following units:</p>
<li>Engineering School, with its <a>Astronomy</a>, <a>Electronics</a> and Industrial <a>Chemistry</a> institutes;</li>
<li>Medical College, with its <a>Dentistry</a> and <a>Pharmacy</a> institutes;</li>
<li>Law College, with the <a>Commerce</a> School;</li>
<li><a>Philosophy</a>, Science and <a>Linguistics</a> Colleges; and</li>
<p>The third transformation took place in 1947, when it became <em>Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul</em> (University of Rio Grande do Sul) - URGS -, merging with the Law and Dentistry Colleges from <a>Pelotas</a> and with the Pharmacy College from <a>Santa Maria</a>.
These units, however, separated from URGS upon foundation of the federal universities of <a>Pelotas</a> and <a>Santa Maria</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1950, control of the university passed to the <a>Federal Government</a>, after which the name included the word <em>Federal</em>.</p>
