affiliation$$$@@@%%%<em>Politechnika Gda&#x0144;ska</em>) - is a <a>technical university</a> located in <a>Gda&#x0144;sk</a>-<a>Wrzeszcz</a>, <a>Poland</a>.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Current rector of the university is <a>Henryk Krawczyk</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1995 <a>Wirtualna Polska</a> was founded here and the office of the company is still located in one of the former campus canteens.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History== The university was founded in 1904 as <strong>K&#x00f6;nigliche Technische Hochschule zu Danzig</strong>, at which time Gdansk, then known as Danzig, was part of the <a>German Empire</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The history of Gdansk is complex and the city itself belonged, at different times, to <a>Germany</a>, Poland and was a <a>&quot;free city&quot;</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The names of the city's educational institutions were affected by the changes in the city status.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was known by different names: 1918-1921 - Technische Hochschule in Danzig; 1921&#x2013;1939 - Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig; 1939&#x2013;1941 &#x2013; Technische Hochschule Danzig; and 1941&#x2013;1945 &#x2013; Reichshochschule Danzig.
established$$$@@@%%%In the late 1930s, Polish students were subject to discrimination by German teachers, many of whom had previously joined the <a>NSDAP Nazi Party</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Following the outbreak of <a>World War II</a>, Polish students were expelled from the university.
established$$$@@@%%%Towards the end of the war, the university was turned into a German army hospital.
established$$$@@@%%%When <a>Soviet</a> <a>Red Army</a> captured the university/hospital, Russian soldiers shot dead some of the Germans and then closed all exits to the main building and burned alive the remaining wounded German soldiers.
established$$$@@@%%%The Russians arranged stables and barracks in other buildings.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1945, all Germans were expelled from the city of Gdansk and the burned ruins were turned into a Polish university (24.05.1945).
established$$$@@@%%%In light of tragic history of the university under <a>Nazi</a> rule, today's Polish university officially does not continue traditions of pre-war schools and its history starts in 1945.</p>
