<p>The <strong>New England Conservatory of Music</strong> (<strong>NEC</strong>) in <a>Boston, Massachusetts</a>, is the oldest independent <a>school of music</a> in the <a>United States</a>.&lt;ref name=necold/&gt;</p>
<p>The conservatory is home each year to 750 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate studies along with 1400 more in its <em>Preparatory School</em> as well as the <em>School of Continuing Education</em>.
At the collegiate level, NEC offers the <a>Bachelor of Music</a>, <a>Master of Music</a>, and <a>Doctor of Musical Arts</a>, as well as the Undergraduate Diploma, Graduate Diploma, and Artist Diploma.
Its primary concert hall, <a>Jordan Hall</a>, plays an important role in the cultural scene of the entire <a>New England</a> region, hosting over 600 concerts each year and receiving frequent praise for its <a>acoustical</a> <a>qualities</a>.&lt;ref
<h2>History</h2>
<p>NEC was founded in 1867 by Eben Tourjee, who modelled it after the European conservatories of that time.
Initially, it was located in the <a>Boston Music Hall</a> just off Tremont Street in downtown Boston.
In 1870 it moved to the former St. James Hotel in Franklin Square in the South End.
It moved to its present location in the Symphony/Prudential Neighborhood on Huntington Avenue in 1903.</p>
<p>In 1881, when <a>Henry Lee Higginson</a> established the <a>Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>, he drew heavily on school's faculty to serve as section leaders.
Today, the school and the orchestra continue to share a close association - nearly half of the BSO is composed of conservatory faculty and alumni.&lt;ref
name=partners/&gt; When Boston established its first full-scale <a>opera</a> company in 1908, the manager, conductors, soloists, orchestra, chorus, library, and rehearsal rooms were all provided by the conservatory.
After that company's demise, <a>Boris Goldovsky</a>'s Opera Theater gave local audiences their first fully staged performances in more than a decade.
In 1958, Goldovsky's prot&#x00e9;g&#x00e9; <a>Sarah Caldwell</a> founded the <a>Opera Company of Boston</a>, which gained international acclaim for its innovative programming.</p>
Opened in 1903, Jordan Hall was the gift of New England Conservatory trustee Eben D. Jordan the 2nd, a member of the family that founded the <a>Jordan Marsh</a> retail stores and himself an amateur musician.
In 1901, Jordan donated land for NEC's main building, while also offering to fund a concert hall with a gift of $120,000.</p>
<p>The dedication concert of Jordan Hall, performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, took place on October 20, 1903, and created quite a stir.
Effusive newspaper accounts deemed the hall &quot;unequaled the world over,&quot; and The Boston Globe reported that it was &quot;a place of entertainment that European musicians who were present that evening say excels in beauty anything of the kind they ever saw.&quot; &lt;ref name=hh/&gt;</p>
<p>A major renovation project was completed in 1995, and since then Jordan Hall has won numerous awards including the 1996 Massachusetts Historical Commission Preservation Award, the Victorian Society in America's Preservation Commendation, the 1996 Boston Preservation Alliance Award, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Award of Merit, and the Illuminating Engineering Society 1996 Lumen Award.</p>
<p>The NEC campus consists of three buildings on both sides of Gainsborough Street between St. Botolph Street and <a>Huntington Avenue</a>, one block from <a>Symphony Hall</a>.
The St. Botolph Building, at 241 St. Botolph street, contains Pierce Hall, a computer laboratory, the electronic music studio, and the majority of the school's classrooms and administrative offices.</p>
In 2005, 292 students were admitted out of a total of 968 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 30%.&lt;ref
name=ct/&gt; NEC is renowned for its <a>strings</a>, jazz, brass, and chamber music departments.
<p>New England Conservatory's Preparatory School is an open enrollment institution for pre-college students that offers music classes and private instruction for young musicians, and fosters over 20 small and large ensembles.
Students enrolled in New England Conservatory's Preparatory School may participate in the Certificate Program, allowing students to achieve their optimum performance skills, competence in music theory, and a knowledge of the literature that includes choral, orchestral, and chamber music, as well as solo repertoire.
NEC Prep is home to one of the world's leading youth orchestras, the highly selective Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (YPO), headed by <a>Benjamin Zander</a>.
In June 2007, the orchestra embarked on a highly publicized three-week tour of China.
The Preparatory School also houses the Massachusetts Youth Wind Ensemble (MYWE), a highly selective touring wind ensemble open to advanced high school woodwind, brass, and percussion players directed by Michael Mucci.
The Preparatory School routinely sends students to the finest conservatories and universities in the world.</p>
<p>New England Conservatory's School of Continuing Education allows members of the surrounding community to experience the benefits of New England Conservatory's world class instruction, offering classes, lessons, and ensemble opportunities to musicians of any background.
In addition, NEC's School of Continuing Education offers classes in several fields including music history, music theory, and Alexander technique, many of which are instructed by members of the New England Conservatory college faculty.</p>
<p>The <a>composition department</a> at NEC first started gaining international relevance in the contemporary classical music world under the tenure of <a>Gunther Schuller</a>, who was president of the conservatory from 1967 to 1977 and one of the most significant figures in 20th century music.
The current chair of the department is <a>Michael Gandolfi</a>.
The music produced at NEC frequently <a>fuses</a> multiple genres, such as <a>jazz</a> and - to a lesser extent - various <a>rock</a> and <a>folk music</a>, in addition to the more conventional academic classical music.</p>
<h2>Also of note</h2>
<p>NEC is co-founder and educational partner of <em><a>From the Top</a></em>, a weekly radio program that celebrates outstanding young classical musicians from the entire country.
<p>The conservatory offers five-year joint double-degree programs with <a>Harvard University</a> and <a>Tufts University</a> and cross-registration with Tufts, <a>Northeastern University</a>, and <a>Simmons College</a>.&lt;ref
<p>NEC is the founding institution of <a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity</a> and <a>Kappa Gamma Psi</a> Performing Arts Fraternity.</p>
<a>Jacqueline Piatigorsky</a> (<em>nee</em> Rothschild), a patron of the arts and wife of the great cellist <a>Gregor Piatigorsky</a>, created an endowment for the New England Conservatory of Music in 1985 to provide a cash prize and a series of concert engagements for the recipient.</p>
