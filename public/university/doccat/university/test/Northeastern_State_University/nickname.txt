NSU announced on May 23, 2006 that they would be dropping &quot;Redmen&quot; in favor of a new mascot to represent the school.
Although the &quot;Redmen&quot; name was not deemed to be hostile or abusive towards Native Americans by the <a>NCAA</a>, restrictions connected to the use of American Indian nicknames could have affected future NSU athletic competitions had NSU not taken the initiative to comply before the Redmen name became an issue.
<p>There are several restaurants on, or just off NSU's campus some of which include the <em>Iguana Cafe</em>, <em>El Zarape</em>, <em>Sam &amp; Ella's Chicken Palace (Pizza)</em>, <em>The Town Branch Eatery &amp; Pub</em>, <em>Flo's Cafe</em> (located on campus in the Florence Willson Hall), and <em>Vidalia's</em>.
<p>There are several campus organizations such as RHA (Residence Halls Association), NAB (Northeastern Activities Board), and NSGA (Northeastern Student Government Association) that provide alternate activities, usually free of charge for students to enjoy on campus.
The purpose of the NSGA is to establish a representative student government and to provide a forum for student's views and ideas for the purpose of promoting and representing the students of NSU.
The campus offers upper-level and graduate courses in education, business, general studies, nursing, industrial management.
