<h2>History and development</h2>
<p>The university descends from two <a>Anglican</a> teacher training colleges, which were founded in York in 1841 (for men) and 1846 (for women).
In 1862, the women's college relocated to <a>Ripon</a>.
Over the next century, the colleges gradually diversified their education programmes.
The colleges merged in 1974 to form the <strong>College of Ripon and York St John</strong>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Quad West entrance</a> In 1990 the combined institution formally became a college of the <a>University of Leeds</a>; this arrangement allowed it to award degrees in the name of the latter, while remaining in practice largely autonomous.
Between 1999 and 2001, all activities were transferred to York and the college received the name  <strong>York St John College</strong>.</p>
<p>In February 2006, the College was granted the right to award degrees in its own name and the right to call itself a University College.
On 10 July 2006 the <a>Privy Council</a> approved a request from the college to become a fully-fledged University; the name became <strong>York St John University</strong> on 1 October 2006, and the first Chancellor (installed at a ceremony in York Minster on 7 March 2007) is the <a>Archbishop of York</a> <a>John Sentamu</a>.</p>
<p>Students can study a range of subjects at foundation and undergraduate level, including film and television production (see <a>filmmaking</a>), <a>physiotherapy</a>, <a>occupational therapy</a>, <a>literature</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>psychology</a>, <a>counselling</a>, business management, marketing, tourism, history, music, art, design, theatre, dance, sport related programmes, psychology, <a>theology</a> and primary <a>education</a>.
<p>At postgraduate and post-experience level, York St John Business School offers a suite of Masters programmes including a new MBA programme.
Other subject areas offered at postgraduate level include theology, education, theatre, fine art, film production, music composition, counselling, health, linguistics and TESOL.</p>
<p>The University was ranked third from bottom (113th of 115) in the United Kingdom Research Assessment Exercise in 2010.
In 2005, the university was included amongst 74 other academic institutions which were permitted to use the wording &quot;centre of excellence&quot; in its publicity and other material.
<p>Currently, almost half (49%) of the University's graduates will remain unemployed one year after graduation.</p>
In the last Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 the growing research excellence was rewarded with a 518% increase in funding (against an 8% sector average).</p>
For comparison, students at <a>Huddersfield University</a> face an average debt of &#x00a3;8,309  while <a>Hull University</a> students face an even higher &#x00a3;21,290.
Overall, student debt at York St John was second highest in the region.</p>
<p>In 2010, the University's Student Union began a programme of action designed to combat the growing antisocial behaviour amongst its own students.
Private security staff paid by the Union were reported to be on patrol until 3am in areas where record numbers of complaints had arisen.
In 2002, a campaign entitled &quot;SSHH - Silent Students Happy Homes&quot; was initiated to combat local residents' fears of <a>studentification</a>.
This campaign was designed to reduce litter levels on campus and in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>In October 2009 the Student Union was awarded a Bronze <a>Students' Union Evaluation Initiative</a> award, one of 16 institutions to receive this accolade.
Currently <a>Sheffield University</a> shares the gold award with the nearby <a>Leeds University</a>.</p>
The oldest of which is the Rowing Club, founded 11 years after the college in 1852 catering for all levels of experience from competent rowers to complete beginners.
The <a>Rowing Club</a> was founded in 1852 and is the longest standing club of the university.</p>
