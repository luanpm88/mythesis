<h2>History, formation and campus developments</h2>
<p>NMMU was formed through the merger of the following institutions: The <strong>PE Technikon</strong>, which had its roots in the Port Elizabeth Art School founded in 1882 (the oldest art school in South Africa).
The institution later became the <strong>College for Advanced Technical Education</strong> (CATE).
The college moved from Central to the coastal suburb of <a>Summerstrand</a> in 1974 and became the PE Technikon in 1979.
The PE Technikon expanded to the Western Cape in 1985 when it took over the College for Forestry, <a>Saasveld</a>, from the Department of Forestry.
The Teachers&#x2019; Training College, located opposite The Boardwalk Waterfront Complex [<a>http://www.suninternational.com/DESTINATIONS/CASINOS/BOARDWALK/Pages/default.aspx</a>] in Summerstrand, was taken over by the Technikon in 1994.</p>
