<p>The Jerusalem campus is the only seminary in Israel for training <a>Reform Jewish</a> clergy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>HUC was founded in 1875 under the leadership of Rabbi <a>Isaac Mayer Wise</a> in <a>Cincinnati, Ohio</a>.
The first rabbinical class graduated in 1883.
The graduation banquet for this class included food that was not <a>kosher</a>, such as <a>clams</a>, <a>soft-shell crabs</a>, <a>shrimp</a>, <a>frogs' legs</a> and dairy products served immediately after meat.
At the time, Reform <a>rabbis</a> were split over the question of whether the Jewish dietary restrictions were still applicable.
Some of the more traditionalist Reform rabbis thought the banquet menu went too far, and were compelled to find an alternative between Reform Judaism and <a>Orthodox Judaism</a>.
In addition to its Rabbinical School, the College-Institute includes Schools of Graduate Studies, Education, Jewish Communal Service, <a>sacred music</a>, <a>Biblical archaeology</a> and an <a>Israel</a>i rabbinical program.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles campus operates many of its programs and degrees in cooperation with the neighboring <a>University of Southern California</a>, a partnership that has lasted over 35 years.
Their productive relationship includes the creation of The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement which is a inter-faith think tank through the partnership of HUC, USC and Omar Foundation.
<p>Rabbi <a>Alfred Gottschalk</a> was appointed as HUC's sixth president, following the death of <a>Nelson Glueck</a>.
As president, Gottschalk oversaw the growth and expansion of the HUC campuses, the ordination of <a>Sally Priesand</a> as the first woman Rabbi in the United States, as well as the investiture of reform Judaism's first woman <a>hazzan</a> and the ordination of <a>Naamah Kelman</a> as the first woman rabbi in <a>Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Notable faculty members have included <a>Judah Magnes</a>, who was also the founding chancellor and president of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, <a>Abraham Joshua Heschel</a>, <a>Nelson Glueck</a>, <a>Moses Buttenweiser</a>, <a>Eugene Borowitz</a>, <a>Jacob Z. Lauterbach</a>, <a>Lawrence A. Hoffman</a>, <a>Steven M. Cohen</a> and <a>Debbie Friedman</a>.</p>

<p>The School of Sacred Music of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion was founded in 1947.
The SSM is located on the New York campus of HUC-JIR at One West Fourth Street.
The SSM offers a five-year graduate program, conferring the degree of Master of Sacred Music in the fourth year and investiture as cantor in the fifth year.</p>
<p>Cantorial School at HUC-JIR begins in Jerusalem and continues for the next four years in New York.
While in Israel, students study   Hebrew,  and Jewish music, and get  to know Israel.
In New York, the program includes professional learning opportunities as a student-cantor, in which students serve congregations within and outside of the NY area .</p>
<p>The Curriculum includes liturgical music classes covering traditional Shabbat, High Holiday and Festival nusach, Chorus, Musicology, Reform Liturgy and Composition; Judaica and text classes such as Bible, Midrash and History; and professional development.
Each student is assigned practica (mini-recitals) during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year of school culminating with a Senior Recital (based on a thesis) during the 5th year.</p>
<p>In keeping with the tradition of gender equality in Reform Judaism, HUC has both male and female students in all its programs, including rabbinic and cantorial studies.
Since its founding, the College-Institute has ordained over 2,800 rabbis and over 400 cantors.
(<em>See</em> <a>Women and the rabbinical credential</a>).
The first female rabbi to be ordained by HUC was Sally Priesand, ordained in 1972 [<a>http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/priesand-sally-jane</a>].
The first female cantor to be invested by HUC was Barbara Ostfeld-Horowitz in 1975 [<a>http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/cantors-american-jewish-women</a>].</p>
<p>The HUC <a>library</a> system contains one of the most extensive Jewish collections in the world  with close to a million volumes on the four campuses.
The collection includes 150 incunabula (the earliest printed books), more than 2,000 manuscript codices, and many thousands of pages of archival documents.
<p>The HUC-JIR Museum at the New York campus presents exhibitions highlighting <a>Jewish history</a>, culture, and contemporary creativity.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1983 as the Joseph Gallery, the HUC-JIR Museum has grown physically to encompass  of exhibition space, expanding to include the Petrie Great Hall, Klingenstein Gallery, Heller Gallery and Backman Gallery.
Amongst the exhibitions presented to date, the Museum has mounted seminal shows for emerging artists, surveys of leading mid-career and elder artists; cutting-edge exhibitions illuminating Jewish issues, including contemporary artistic responses to the Holocaust, the history of African-American and Jewish relations since 1654 to the present, the impact of family violence on the works of contemporary Israeli and American women artists, and the current situation in Israel and contemporary Israeli identity; landmark exhibitions establishing new directions for contemporary Jewish ceremonial art; group exhibitions reflecting new interpretations of Biblical text; and exhibitions of significant private collections, reflecting Jewish identity and consciousness, which have advanced the definition of Jewish art in the 20th century.
