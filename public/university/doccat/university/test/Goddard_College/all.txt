affiliation$$$@@@%%%<strong>Goddard College</strong> is a private college located in <a>Plainfield</a>, <a>Vermont</a>, that grants bachelor degrees (<a>BA</a> and <a>BFA</a>) and master degrees (<a>MA</a> and <a>MFA</a>).
established$$$@@@%%%The original antecedent of the college was founded as Green Mountain Central Institute in 1863.
established$$$@@@%%%The college currently uses a self-directed, mentored system of intensive residencies in Plainfield or <a>Port Townsend, Washington</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Residencies require the student's attendance every six months for approximately eight days, during which time the student engages in a variety of activities and lectures from the early morning until quite late in the evening.
country$$$@@@%%%After the residency, students return home and study independently, sending in &quot;packets&quot; to their faculty mentor every three weeks.
established$$$@@@%%%The content of the &quot;packets&quot; varies with each individual.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Goddard College was founded by Royce Stanley &quot;Tim&quot; Pitkin, a progressive educator and follower of <a>John Dewey</a> and other, similar proponents of <em>educational democracy</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%Pitkin conceived of the college as a place for &quot;plain living and hard thinking.&quot;

established$$$@@@%%%<p>Having narrative transcripts instead of traditional letter grades, as well as learner-designed curricula, Goddard was one of the <a>Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities</a>, which also included <a>Franconia</a>, <a>Nasson</a>, <a>Antioch</a>, and several other educational institutions.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Goddard College advocates innovation in higher education as its expressed objective; in 1963, Goddard introduced the first Adult Degree Program for working adults.
head_label$$$@@@%%%This program has been copied around the world [<a>http://www.eckerd.edu/pel/about/index.php</a>] and since that date, over twenty million adults have been educated using this innovative, intensive, student-centered model.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2002, after fifty-four years, the college terminated its traditional age on-site experimental bachelor degree program.
established$$$@@@%%%Today its more than six hundred adult students attend residencies in either Plainfield, VT or Port Townsend, WA.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Only two programs are available at the Port Townsend site: the MFA in Creative Writing and the MFA in Interdisciplinary Arts, which was new to Port Townsend in the fall of 2007.
established$$$@@@%%%Also new for the fall of 2007 was the first low-residency Bachelor of Fine Arts program in creative writing.

affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Governance of the college always has been <a>communitarian</a>, but Barbara Vacarr has been its president since 2010.[<a>http://www.goddard.edu/stuff/contentmgr/files/59036f939b05852b9c0a3c825e4cefd5/misc/dr._barbara_vacarr_named_new_goddard_college_president.pdf</a>]
established$$$@@@%%%The history of Goddard has been tumultuous, similar to many <a>Free Schools</a> practicing the <a>pedagogical</a> theories of educators such as <a>John Dewey</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Although many free schools have ceased to exist, Goddard remains alive, well, and atypical, still promoting education as a process of self-discovery in which the learner is firmly in charge.
established$$$@@@%%%Accordingly, while Goddard is not for everyone, it has been, and continues to be, a home for creative, persistent, and self-directed students.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Goddard also is home to a community <a>radio station</a> that serves central Vermont, broadcasting as, <a>WGDR</a>, 91.1 FM, which is part of the <a>Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a>.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Campus</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The campus in Plainfield was initially formed into a school in 1938 from the various shingle style buildings on a late 19th century model farm: the Greatwood Estate.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Eleven new dormitory buildings were constructed adjacent to the ensemble of renovated farm buildings in 1963 to accommodate an increasing student population.
established$$$@@@%%%The Pratt Learning Center, sited to be at the heart of a larger campus, was constructed in 1968.
campus$$$@@@%%%No other significant new construction has been added to the campus since that time.</p>
