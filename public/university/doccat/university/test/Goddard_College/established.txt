The original antecedent of the college was founded as Green Mountain Central Institute in 1863.
The college currently uses a self-directed, mentored system of intensive residencies in Plainfield or <a>Port Townsend, Washington</a>.
<p>Residencies require the student's attendance every six months for approximately eight days, during which time the student engages in a variety of activities and lectures from the early morning until quite late in the evening.

<p>Goddard College was founded by Royce Stanley &quot;Tim&quot; Pitkin, a progressive educator and follower of <a>John Dewey</a> and other, similar proponents of <em>educational democracy</em>.
Pitkin conceived of the college as a place for &quot;plain living and hard thinking.&quot;
<p>Having narrative transcripts instead of traditional letter grades, as well as learner-designed curricula, Goddard was one of the <a>Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities</a>, which also included <a>Franconia</a>, <a>Nasson</a>, <a>Antioch</a>, and several other educational institutions.</p>
<p>Goddard College advocates innovation in higher education as its expressed objective; in 1963, Goddard introduced the first Adult Degree Program for working adults.
<p>In 2002, after fifty-four years, the college terminated its traditional age on-site experimental bachelor degree program.
Today its more than six hundred adult students attend residencies in either Plainfield, VT or Port Townsend, WA.
Also new for the fall of 2007 was the first low-residency Bachelor of Fine Arts program in creative writing.
The history of Goddard has been tumultuous, similar to many <a>Free Schools</a> practicing the <a>pedagogical</a> theories of educators such as <a>John Dewey</a>.
Although many free schools have ceased to exist, Goddard remains alive, well, and atypical, still promoting education as a process of self-discovery in which the learner is firmly in charge.
Accordingly, while Goddard is not for everyone, it has been, and continues to be, a home for creative, persistent, and self-directed students.</p>
<p>The campus in Plainfield was initially formed into a school in 1938 from the various shingle style buildings on a late 19th century model farm: the Greatwood Estate.
The Pratt Learning Center, sited to be at the heart of a larger campus, was constructed in 1968.
<li>Year founded: 1863, as Green Mountain Central Institute; in 1870 became Goddard Seminary and opened for business</li>
<li>Goddard College was host to the <a>Bread and Puppet Theater</a> in 1970-1971</li>
