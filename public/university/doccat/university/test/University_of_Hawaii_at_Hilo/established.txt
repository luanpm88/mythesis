<h2>College of Pharmacy</h2>
<p>The College of Pharmacy or <strong>CoP</strong> opened its doors for to an inaugural class of 90 students in August 2007.
<p>The founding Dean of the College of Pharmacy, Dr. John M. Pezzuto, Ph.D., is an author of over 400 publications, co-inventor of several patents, the editor of three books, member of eleven editorial boards of international journals, and the current Editor-in-Chief of the <a>academic journal</a> <a>Pharmaceutical Biology</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education</a> (ACPE) accredits all pharmacy programs in the U.S. through a three-step process: Pre-Candidate status for programs that haven&#x2019;t enrolled students; Candidate Status, awarded to a program with students enrolled pending graduating its first class; and Full Accreditation.</p>
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> achieved the first step in the Pharmacy School Accreditation Process from the <a>ACPE</a> when it was granted Pre-Candidate Status in June 2007.
The <strong>CoP</strong> became the first school in the State of Hawai<img>i recognized by the ACPE to offer the Doctor of Pharmacy (<a>Pharm.D.</a>) degree, and will graduate its first class in 2011.</p>
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> was awarded Candidate Accreditation Status during the June 2008 Executive Board Meeting of the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE), which was again reconfirmed in 2009.
UH Hilo is on track and eligible in May 2011 to receive Full Accreditation when the first group of <a>Pharm.D.</a> students will graduate.
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> was recently accredited by the <a>ACPE</a> as a provider of <a>continuing pharmacy education (CPE)</a> credits in July 2009.
<a>ACPE</a> is also in charge of accrediting providers of continuing pharmacy education in addition to <a>pharmacy school</a>s.
The accreditation by the ACPE was granted after the <strong>CoP</strong> was approved to offer <a>continuing medical education</a> (CME) by the Hawai<img>i Medical Association in May 2009.
CPE programs sponsored by the <strong>CoP</strong> will cover the same broad range of topics in medicine and patient care, according to Dr. Karen Pellegrin, Chair of the Continuing Education Executive Committee and Director of Strategic Planning for the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>A temporary modular compound of three buildings with one lecture auditorium, laboratories, and offices have allowed the <strong>CoP</strong> to have a presence on the main UH Hilo campus since 2009.
The <strong>CoP</strong> is on track to move forward with the building of additional teaching and research facilities, thanks to a newly announced $1 million gift from the J.M. Long Foundation.
In recognition of this contribution from the J.M. Long Foundation; two lecture halls, a student center, and lanais will be named the Joseph M. Long Pavilion.
Additionally, Hawai<img>i Governor <a>Linda Lingle</a> released $5.5 million for planning and design of a permanent building for the College of Pharmacy in October 2009.
The state legislature had approved the funding earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo is planning to be the first school in the country to offer a dual degree with a Family Nurse Practitioner Specialty and Doctorate in Pharmacy (<a>FNP</a>/<a>Pharm.D.</a>), thanks to a congressionally directed $951,000 grant from the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The new program has been created and jointly offered by the <strong>College of Pharmacy</strong> and from the <strong>College of Arts and Sciences</strong>, Department of Nursing.
This program is expected to begin in fall 2010 and will require a six-and-a-half-year commitment from the student, said Dr. Edward Fisher, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>CoP</strong> Dean John Pezzuto said the FNP/Pharm.D. degree would broaden the scope of practice of pharmacists through education and training in the diagnosis and hands-on management of common acute and chronic medical conditions.
Additionally, a <a>FNP</a>/<a>Pharm.D.</a> dual degree would provide nurse practitioners detailed skills relating to medications and potential food and drug interactions.</p>
<li>Create a general practice <a>pharmacy residency</a> program, as well as a drug information and medication therapy management center and <a>distance learning</a> program</li>
<li>Develop a <a>clinical pharmacist</a> training model for rural and underserved areas in Hawai<img>i.
<li>Begin the planning phase for a <a>Doctor of Physical Therapy</a> (DPT) program</li>
<p>A consortium led by the College of Pharmacy to use health information technology to provide better health care to Big Island residents has been awarded $16,091,390.
<a>U.S. Vice President</a> <a>Joe Biden</a> and <a>U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> <a>Kathleen Sebelius</a> announced the award at a May 4, 2010 press conference in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The UH Hilo College of Pharmacy is the lead applicant organization for the grant from the Hawai<img>i County Beacon Community Consortium, a group of educators, health care providers, insurers and other community members.
The group was formed to strengthen and use health information technology to continuously improve healthcare quality, cost-efficiency, and population health in Hawai<img>i County.</p>
The funds were awarded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is funded by the <a>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>.</p>
<p>APPE for the fourth-year students begins in the summer after their third year of pharmacy school and includes a minimum of 1,440 hours of pharmacy experiences as required by ACPE, the national accreditation board that oversees pharmacy schools.
<p>The College of Continuing Education and Community Service or <strong>CCECS</strong> is the arm of the University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo responsible for a number of important endeavors, including:</p>
Using resources from within the community as well as bringing in knowledgeable professionals who can enhance instructional experiences for the better of the students is the goal of <strong>CCECS</strong>.</p>
<p>Students come from over 40 countries and territories to take classes at UH Hilo.
The campus has the highest percentage of international students of any of the ten campuses in the <a>UH</a> <a>system</a>.
The ELI&#x2019;s primary purpose is to provide English instruction to international and immigrant students whose native language is not English and to prepare them for university study.</p>
<p>The <strong>ELI</strong> offers rigorous academic preparation courses for students who would like to study in a degree program at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.  <strong>ELI</strong> courses carry administrative credit, but do not count towards graduation from UH Hilo.</p>
<p>Distance learning, or e-Learning, provides students across the Big Island and the state of Hawaii with the opportunity to take classes offered by the University of Hawaii at Hilo.
The UH Hilo Distance Learning Coordinator provides referrals to statewide e-Learning as a member of the UH system.

Consumption of alcohol is NOT permitted anywhere in these halls.</p>
Additionally, the Research Corporation of the University of Hawai<img>i or <strong>RCUH</strong> helps to administrate the research activities across the <a>University of Hawaii system</a>.</p>
The University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo Office of Intercollegiate Athletics has thirteen varsity teams as a member of the <a>NCAA Division II</a>, <a>Pacific West Conference</a>.
UH Hilo has been a member of the <a>PacWest Conference</a> since 2004.
The team name for the school is the Vulcans.</p>
<p>In 1965, a process was begun to adapt an individual identity for the University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.
Previously known as the &quot;Little Rainbows&quot;, the committee members focused on what would best represent the Island of Hawai<img>i.
Active volcanoes were immediately thought of and one of the first considerations was &quot;Pele&quot;, the Hawaiian Volcano Goddess.
<p><a>Vulcan</a> is the Roman god of Fire and Volcanoes.
He was an important member of the pantheon of the Romans.
<a>Vulcan</a> is the patron god of artisans and blacksmiths.
He was the son of <a>Jupiter</a> and <a>Juno</a> and his home was in the heart of <a>Mount Etna</a>.
His forge was thought to be the source of volcanic activity.</p>
<p><a>Vulcan's</a> Greek counterpart is <a>Hephaestus</a>, the God of Destructive Terrestrial Fire and Volcanic Fire.
He was the divine inventor and builder of magical things.
From Vulcan, we receive the term <a>Vulcanization</a>.
This is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities, such as strength, elasticity, resistance to solvents, and rendering it impervious to moderate heat and cold.</p>
<h2>&quot;Hawai<img>i State University?&quot;</h2>
<p>There has been a sentiment among some in the community to separate the Hilo campus from the University of Hawai<img>i system, questioning the creation of a &quot;Hawai<img>i State University&quot;.
Supporters of the separation argued that the growing Hilo campus is &quot;shortchanged&quot; by its sister campus in M&#x0101;noa and that being independent of the system would allow the college to grow faster and draw in more money from independent sources, thus better serving the community.
The notion of making it administratively independent by establishing something like (a) Hawai<img>i State University doesn't make much sense... it won't become an economic salvation for Hilo.&quot;
<p>A bill was introduced in the 2005 session of the House of Representatives of the Hawai<img>i State Legislature to draft legislation to spin off the Hilo campus as the independent Hawai<img>i State University.
The bill was approved by the House Higher Education Committee but no hearing on the bill was planned by the House Finance Committee, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>UH Hilo in 2009 brought in over $20 million of grant and research money, more than any other in the UH system, prompting many to finally concede the fact that UH Hilo has reached the status of &quot;research university&quot;.
The addition of the College of Pharmacy was a pinnacle achievement for UH Hilo and with the new development of permanent buildings on the horizon, UH Hilo will look more like a full-fledged research facility.</p>
<p>A recent discussion with an unnamed professor about any immediate future possibility of a Hawai<img>i State University was quoted stating &quot;the recent grant money received solidified the connection between UH M&#x0101;noa and UH Hilo, strengthening the relationship of the two campuses to new levels and there is no chance of a breakaway from the UH system in the foreseen future.&quot;</p>
