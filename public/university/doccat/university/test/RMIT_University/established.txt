<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:ConstructionWorkingMensCollegeMelbourne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Construction of the [[Working Men's College of Melbourne|Working Men's College]], circa 1880s]] The <a>Working Men's College of Melbourne</a> was founded in 1887 by a prominent <a>grazier</a> and <a>philanthropist</a>, <a>The Hon.</a> <a>Francis Ormond</a> <a>MLC</a>, who donated &#x00a3;5000 toward the establishment of the college.
The Council of the <a>Melbourne Trades Hall</a> then matched Ormond's initial donation through rallying its members.</p>

<p>RMIT is also ranked as the top <a>entrepreneurial</a> university in Australia, and 12th in the World, according to the GSEA annual Top Entrepreneurial Universities List.
<p>The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is a <a>public university</a> created under the <em>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act of 1992</em> by the <a>Government of Victoria</a>.
Before its creation as a public university, RMIT was a private institution for 105 years.
Each school is grouped into one of three academically-contextual colleges, which are known as &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Design and Social Context&quot; and &quot;Science, Engineering and Health&quot;.

<p>The parade is welcomed at Federation Square by the <a>Lord Mayor of Melbourne</a>, on behalf of the city and its citizens.
The Lord Mayor then grants RMIT's <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> a &quot;<a>writ</a> of passage&quot; to proceed with the graduation ceremony, which takes place at the <a>Docklands Stadium</a>, and is the largest university graduation ceremony in Australia.</p>
