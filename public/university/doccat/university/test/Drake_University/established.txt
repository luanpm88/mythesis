<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Francis Marion Drake</a> <a>thumb|Old Main</a> The institution was founded in 1881, when most of the staff of <a>Oskaloosa College</a> left that college to establish what would become Drake University, founded by <a>Francis Marion Drake</a>, a resident of <a>Centerville</a>, <a>Iowa</a> and <a>Governor of Iowa</a> (1896&#x2013;1898).
From its founding in 1881, Drake University maintained affiliation with the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a> although no religious affiliation is officially recognized today.</p>
<p>The university's <a>law school</a>, the oldest law school in the country west of the Mississippi River, was established in 1865 by Chester C. Cole [<a>http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/about/history/justices/CCCole.asp</a>], who served on the <a>Iowa Supreme Court</a> from 1864 to 1876.
In 1969 Drake's basketball team went to the Final Four under coach Maurice John, but were defeated by the <a>UCLA</a> Bruins by three points.
<p>On September 17, 1969 the Drake student newspaper, <em>The <a>Times-Delphic</a>[<a>http://www.timesdelphic.com</a>],</em>
published what appears to be the first documented account of the famous <a>Paul is dead</a> hoax, written by Tim Harper.
A practical education is that which gives the mind the most power and adaptability.
The credentials that your young and hopeful alma mater will soon confer upon each of you can only give you an introduction to the world of letters and of actual life.
In whatever of the varied vocations of life you may engage, as well as in general society, you must work out your own destiny.&quot;

<h3>School of Law</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|Opperman Hall - Home to the Law School</a> Drake's law school is one of the twenty-five oldest law schools in the nation, tracing its history to 1865.
It is a charter member of the American Association of Law Schools, has been accredited since 1923 when accreditation first began, and is one of only seventy-five ABA-approved law schools to have a Chapter of Order of the Coif.
Drake University Law School is home to the American Judicature Society, the archives of the National Bar Association, the nation's oldest and largest national association of predominately African-American lawyers and judges, and the Drake Constitutional Law Center, which is one of only four constitutional law programs established by the U.S. Congress and funded by the federal government.
The Center's mission is to foster in-depth study of the <a>United States Constitution</a>.
A significant aspect of the Center's activities is the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture series, an annual event of national importance in constitutional law.
Numerous current and former United States Supreme Court Justices have delivered the Opperman Lecture, including Justice <a>Clarence Thomas</a>, Justice <a>Antonin Scalia</a>, Justice <a>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, Justice <a>Stephen Breyer</a>, Justice <a>Sandra Day O'Connor</a>, Justice <a>Anthony M. Kennedy</a>, Justice <a>Samuel Alito</a>, Chief Justice <a>John G. Roberts</a>, and late Justices <a>Harry A. Blackmun</a>, <a>Lewis F. Powell</a> and <a>William H. Rehnquist</a>.

It was built in 1992, and is the home of the Drake Bulldogs.

The first Drake basketball game in the Knapp Center was played on December 5, 1992.</p>
<p> Drake University also hosts the <a>Drake Relays</a> during April.
<p>Students kick-off the Relays in the annual tradition of <em>Street Painting</em>, in which student organizations colorfully decorate areas of Carpenter Avenue near the center of campus under a common theme.
The theme in 2007 was &quot;The Legacy Lives On&quot;&#x2014;referencing the $15 million renovation of Drake Stadium.
Other themes have included 2009's &quot;Running Strong a Century Long&quot;, in honor of the 100th running of the Relays, and 2010's &quot;History to you, Tradition to us&quot;.
<a>Streaking</a> the street painting was an annual occurrence for a period in the mid-1990s and has occasionally occurred in a few years following.</p>
<p>The fight song for Drake University is <em>The &quot;D&quot; Song</em>.
<p>Here's to the one who's brave and bold,&lt;br&gt; Ready to battle like days of old,&lt;br&gt; Fights like a Bulldog for victory,&lt;br&gt; Oh, here's to the one who wears the &quot;D&quot;.</p>
<p>Drake University advanced to seventh in the &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; rankings and gained sole possession of fourth place in the overall rankings of 142 Midwest Universities - Master's category published by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> magazine in the 2007 edition of &quot;America's Best Colleges.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year Drake ranked eighth in the &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; category.
The rankings are based on a formula that relates a school's academic quality, as indicated by its <em>U.S. News</em> ranking, to the net cost of attendance for a student who receives the average level of need-based financial aid.
&quot;The higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost, the better the deal,&quot; according to the magazine.</p>
It has the highest ranking in its category of any Iowa college or university.
Drake improved in several areas this year, including student/faculty ratio, average freshmen retention rate and freshmen in the top 25 percent of their high school class.</p>
