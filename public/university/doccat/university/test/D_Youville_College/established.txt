<h2>History</h2>
<p>D'Youville College was founded by the <a>Grey Nuns</a> of the Sacred Heart (GNSH), and named for their patron Saint <a>Marie-Marguerite d'Youville</a>.
The New York State Legislature granted D'Youville a charter to become a college on April 8, 1908.
The college was accredited by the <a>University of the State of New York</a> in 1908, and has maintained their accreditation ever since.</p>
<p>It was the first college to admit women in western New York State, and remained a women's college until the 1970s.
It also started the area's first four-year undergraduate nursing program in 1942.</p>
<p>Upon a voted directive of the Board of Directors, the process of change in status from <a>college</a> to <a>university</a> started in June 2007, with plans to present a formal request to the State Education Department once it finishes reviewing and modifying its requirements.</p>
<p>Also in June 2004, an agreement was made with Balassi B&#x00e1;lint Institute in Budapest, Hungary to exchange students, and later on in June 2007 at Trinity College in Crete, Greece to exchange students.</p>
<p>D'Youville College competes at the <a>NCAA</a> Division III level, and is a member of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC).
<a>Golf</a> is offered as a mixed (co-ed) program.</p>
<p>The Students in Free Enterprise Teams (SIFE), sponsored by the business department, was a national Top 20 finalist for its community service project, assisting those in need and helping high school students become involved in service projects.&lt;ref
<p>Other examples of community outreach include: Back On Track, January 2007 - May 2007; Free tax preparation; the Community Outreach Program which provides shelters and homes to the homeless; Clean the Park, which happens twice a year when students clean up the local park adjacent to the campus.
