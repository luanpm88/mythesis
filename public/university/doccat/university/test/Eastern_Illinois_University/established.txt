Established in 1895 as the <strong>Eastern Illinois State Normal School</strong>, a teacher's college offering a two-year degree, Eastern Illinois University gradually expanded into a comprehensive university with a broad curriculum, including <a>Baccalaureate</a> and <a>Master's degree</a>s in business, arts, sciences, and humanities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
The first building was finished in 1899 [<a>http://www.eiu.edu/~localite/coles/charleston/eiu/oldmain/beginning.htm</a>] and is called Old Main, though it is formally named the <a>Livingston C. Lord</a> Administration Building in honor of EIU's first president, who served from 1899 to 1933.
Built of Indiana limestone in a heavy <a>Gothic revival</a> style with turrets, towers, and battlements, its distinctive outline is the official symbol of the school.
Old Main is one of &quot;<a>Altgeld's castles</a>&quot;, five buildings built in the 1890s at the major Illinois state colleges.
Governor <a>John Peter Altgeld</a> was instrumental in funding the Illinois university system, and he was especially fond of the Gothic style.
Other original <a>Gothic Revival</a> buildings include <a>Booth Library</a> and Blair Hall.
Blair Hall was restored after a disastrous fire in 2004.
In fall 2008, the university opened the newly constructed Doudna Fine Arts Center,  designed by international architect <a>Antoine Predock</a>.
The  complex houses the music, theatre, and visual arts departments.</p>

<p>In the <em><a>US News &amp; World Report</a></em> college rankings, EIU is classified as a Masters university, meaning one that grants no doctoral degrees and draws students primarily from the surrounding area, rather than nationally.
The university also includes the Center for Academic Support and Achievement, the Office of Minority Affairs, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, and the Office of Study Abroad.
The university's Booth Library hosts yearly exhibits, the Ballenger Teachers Center, and numerous digital collections.
The main university art museum, the Tarble Arts Center, maintains a one-thousand piece permanent collection, including a 500 piece collection of late 20th century Illinois folk arts and related archival information.
A majority of the holdings are concentrated on art from the state of Illinois and the Midwest region.
The school's daily newspaper is <a>The Daily Eastern News</a>.</p>
Throughout the year the residence halls participate in competitions and various community service activities.</p>
<p>Eastern Illinois University features 4 residence hall dining centers, the University Food Court with five fast food locations, Java Beanery &amp; Bakery (Java B &amp; B), and two Marketplace Convenience Centers.
They also operate a restaurant style option (Reservation-Only Dining) on the weekends.</p>
The men's soccer program competes in the <a>Missouri Valley Conference</a> and the swim team competes in <a>The Summit League</a>.
