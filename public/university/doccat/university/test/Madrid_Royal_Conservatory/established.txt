<p>The <strong>Madrid Royal Conservatory</strong> () is a <a>music college</a> in <a>Madrid</a>, <a>Spain</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Royal Conservatory of Music was founded on July 15, 1830, by royal decree, and was originally located in Mostenses Square, Madrid.
In 1852 it was moved to the <a>Royal Opera</a>, where it remained until the building was condemned by royal order and classes ordered to halt in 1925.
For the next sixty-five years, the school had no fixed home, operating in a variety of locations.
Since 1990, the Conservatory has officially resided in a restored 18th century building&#x2014;previously the home of the Hospital Clinic of San Carlos&#x2014;in front of the Queen Sofia National Art Museum.
