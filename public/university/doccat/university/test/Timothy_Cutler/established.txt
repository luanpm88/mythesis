<p> <strong>Timothy Cutler</strong> (May 31, 1684 &#x2013; August 17, 1765) was an American <a>Episcopal</a> clergyman and <a>rector</a> of <a>Yale College</a>.</p>
<p>Cutler was born in <a>Charlestown, Massachusetts</a>, a descendant of Robert Cutler who settled there prior to October 28, 1636.
His father was Major John Cutler, an <a>anchor</a>smith, and his mother, Martha Wiswall.
Both his father and grandfather opposed the government formed after the overthrow of <a>Edmund Andros</a>, an early colonial <a>governor</a> in North America, and head of the short-lived <a>Dominion of New England</a> in 1689.
Although severely penalized, they refused to subscribe to the government until it had received royal sanction.
His ancestors' tendency to conform to the established order suggests a reason for Timothy's subsequent conversion to the <a>Church of England</a>.</p>
<p>When seventeen years old, Cutler graduated from <a>Harvard College</a>, and on January 11, 1709/10, having come from Massachusetts to <a>Connecticut</a> with the recommendation of being &quot;one of the best preachers both colonies afforded&quot;, he was ordained pastor of the <a>Congregational Church</a> in <a>Stratford</a>.</p>
<p>On March 21, 1710/11, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. <a>Samuel Andrew</a> of <a>Milford, Connecticut</a>, then acting rector of Yale College.
Cutler served his parish acceptably until March 1718/19 when, conditions at Yale College calling imperatively for a resident rector, he undertook that office at the request of the trustees, his appointment being formally approved in September.
Although his father-in-law was doubtless instrumental in securing his appointment, Cutler was in general well-fitted for the position, being &quot;an excellent <a>Linguist</a>&quot;, a &quot;good Logician, Geographer, and <a>Rhetoric</a>ian&quot;, while &quot;in the <a>Philosophy</a> &amp; <a>Metaphysics</a> &amp; Ethics of his Day or juvenile Education he was great. . . .
He was of an high, lofty, &amp; despotic mien.
He made a grand figure as the Head of a College&quot;.</p>
<p>The new rectorship opened auspiciously and an era of prosperity seemed at hand when, on September 13, 1722, the rector, with Tutor Daniel Browne and several Congregational clergymen, met with the trustees, declared themselves doubtful of the validity of their ordination, and asked advice with regard to entering the Church of England.
In the meantime <a>Governor Saltonstall</a> arranged a public debate on the matter, held October 16, as a result of which, on the following day, at a special meeting of the trustees, it was voted to &quot;excuse the Rev.
Mr. Cutler from all further services as Rector of Yale College&quot;, and it was provided that all future rectors and tutors should declare to the trustees their assent to the <a>Saybrook Confession of Faith</a>, and give satisfaction as to their opposition to &quot;<a>Arminian</a> and prelatical corruptions.&quot;</p>
<p>Contemporary evidence indicates that Cutler was never wholeheartedly a <a>Dissenter</a>, that he had been converted to <a>Episcopalianism</a> when at Stratford by <a>John Checkley</a>, and that in spite of this fact had accepted the rectorship of a Congregational college, publicly declaring what he had privately believed only when a desirable place in the Established Church was assured him.</p>
<p>After a visit to <a>London</a>, where he was ordained by the <a>Bishop of Norwich</a> in March 1723, and received the degree of <a>D.D.</a> from both <a>Oxford University</a> and <a>Cambridge University</a>, Cutler became rector of the newly formed <a>Christ Church</a>, <a>Boston</a>.
Here he remained until his death, one of the leading Episcopal clergymen of <a>New England</a>, full of polemic spirit, venerated for his learning, but too haughty in manner to be popular.
He founded the church at <a>Dedham</a> and took care of Christ Church, <a>Braintree</a>.
He was a high <a>Tory</a>, intolerant of Dissenters, and a militant defender of the rights of his fellow believers.
With Rev. <a>Samuel Myles</a> of King's Chapel he laid claim to a seat on the Board of Overseers of Harvard, as a minister of the Episcopal Church in Boston, maintaining that he was a &quot;teaching elder&quot; as required by the college charter.
He never ceased to urge the appointment of a <a>bishop</a> for the American colonies.
<p>His daughter, Elizabeth Hilton Cutler, was married to <a>Roger Sherman</a>'s father William on July 15, 1714, by Rev. Simon Bradstreet; and Cutler then married Roger's mother Mehitabel (Sweetman) Wellington on September 13, 1715 in Watertown, <a>Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>; their marriage was performed by Jonas Bond, a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p>Cutler is honored together with <a>Samuel Johnson</a> and <a>Thomas Bradbury Chandler</a> with a <a>feast day</a> on the <a>liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)</a> on August 17.</p>
