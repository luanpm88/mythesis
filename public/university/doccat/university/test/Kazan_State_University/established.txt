It was founded in 1804.
The famous Russian <a>mathematician</a> <a>Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky</a> was its <a>rector</a> from 1827 until 1846.
In 1925, the university was renamed in honour of its most famous alumnus, <a>Vladimir Ilyich Ylyanov-Lenin</a>.
<p>On October 21, 2009, Russian President <a>Dmitry Medvedev</a> signed an executive order that would establish a new <a>Volga Federal University</a> on the basis of Kazan State University.</p>
<p>Kazan University is known as &quot;the birthplace of organic chemistry&quot; due to works of <a>Aleksandr Butlerov</a>, <a>Vladimir Markovnikov</a>, <a>Aleksandr Arbuzov</a>, and the birthplace of <a>Electron Spin Resonance</a> due to work of <a>Evgeny Zavoisky</a>.</p>
<p>Kazan's oldest part of the university building contains three classical portals along its white facade from the original 1822 construction.
Included with this building is the First Boys' Gymnasium and the private residence of <a>Prince Tenichev</a> that was given to the university at the time of its founding.
Korinfsky</a> constructed the rest of the buildings.
These included the Anatomy Theatre, the Library, the Chemistry and Physics Laboratories and the Observatory, completed the University complex and gave it its neo-classical look.
The building of the Chemistry Faculty was constructed in 1954 by the students themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kazan State University is one of the oldest universities in Russia.
It was founded the 5th (New Style 17) of November 1804, when the Emperor Alexander I signed the Charter about the creation of the Kazan Imperial University.</p>
<p>Already during the first decades of its existence, it became one of the major centers of education and science.
It is subject of special pride: the creation of non-Euclidean geometry (Lobachevsky), the discovery of the chemical element ruthenium (KK Claus), the theory about the structure of organic compounds (AM Butlerov), the discovery of the electron paramagnetic resonance (Zavoiskii) and acoustic paramagnetic resonance (SA Altshuler) and many others.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the university has trained more than 70 thousand professionals.
<p>In 1925 the Kazan State University was renamed to the <a>V.
I. Ulyanov-Lenin</a> Kazan State University, by decision of Presidium of the <a>All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK)</a> dated by 25 June, 1925.
Opened in 1809, it first contained Count <a>G.
Potemkin</a>'s books that were brought to Kazan in 1799 mixed with collections of the earliest bibliophiles <a>V.
Polyansky</a> and <a>N.
Subsequently, the <a>Solovetsky Monastery</a> collections were added to the library.
In this special collection are Arabic manuscripts of philosophers and scholars <a>Mansur Al-Hallaj</a> and <a>Avicenna</a> (11-th century) and <a>Ashshakhrestani</a> (12-th century), a manuscript copy of the <a>Pentateuch</a>, the first Russian printed book &quot;<a>The Apostle</a>&quot; (1564), the &quot;<a>Books of Kingdoms</a>&quot; by <a>Francisco Skorin</a> (1518) and the &quot;<a>Code of Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich</a>&quot; (1649).
The Library has first editions of the 18th-century books by <a>Pushkin</a>, <a>Griboyedov</a>, <a>Gogol</a>, <a>Nas&#x00ed;ri</a> and <a>Tuqay</a>.
<p>The library contains many 19th century periodicals, and literature about Kazan and the surrounding region.
The library boasts itself as &quot;the pride of the University and an invaluable source of information for any researcher.&quot;
The original library building was built between 1825 and 1833 by Rector N. Lobachevsky, who was at the same time the Chief Librarian of the University.
The Library, which now bears his name, is still growing, and even its new building cannot house all the collections.
