In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Morison, who moved the college from its Boylston Street address in Boston to its current day location in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973.
In the late 1990s, Bentley College became a pioneer of incorporating information technology into its core business curriculum.

The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005.
A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school&#x2019;s logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building.
