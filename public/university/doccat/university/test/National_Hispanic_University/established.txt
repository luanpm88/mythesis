<h2>History</h2>
<p>NHU was founded in 1981 in <a>Oakland, California</a>, to address the needs of Hispanic men and women.
Founder Dr. Roberto Cruz had studied the disproportionately large impact <a>historically black colleges and universities</a> had in generating both undergraduate and <a>professional degree</a> graduates within the <a>Black community</a>.
Dr. Cruz's vision was to have similarly positive impact on the Hispanic community in the United States.
In 1990, the university opened a San Jose campus and moved to a larger facility in Oakland.
<p>In 2001, the school sponsored the <a>Latino College Preparatory Academy</a> (LCPA), a charter high school adjacent to the NHU campus.
A large majority of (LCPA) students matriculate at NHU.</p>
<p>In 2010, NHU became a member of the <a>Laureate International Universities</a> network.
<p>: A.A. in Business Administration : B.A. in Business Administration</p>
<p>: A.S. in Mathematics and Science (with/without Engineering Emphasis)</p>
<p>: A.A. in Early Childhood Education</p>
<p>The university has a cross-enrollment agreement with <a>San Jos&#x00e9; State University (SJSU)</a>.
Additionally students can transfer between institutions with up to 60 credits.
<p>The university is accredited by <a>WASC</a> and is rated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a &quot;Baccalaureate College&quot;, with an academic breadth rated as &quot;Diverse Fields&quot; </p>
<p>NHU hosts the San Francisco Bay Area <a>Science Olympiad</a>.</p>
