<h2>History</h2>
<p><strong>UT Martin</strong> began in 1900 as <strong>Hall-Moody Institute</strong> in <a>Martin, Tennessee</a>, a Baptist junior college.
In 1927 the school was in danger of closing, and area civic and political leaders asked the state of <a>Tennessee</a> to step in and operate the school under the auspices of the University of Tennessee, which it did, renaming the institution the <strong>University of Tennessee Junior College</strong>.
It operated under this name until 1951, when, with the addition of four-year fields of study leading to a <a>bachelor</a>'s degree, it was redesignated the <strong>University of Tennessee Martin Branch</strong>.
In 1967 it was designated as a primary campus of the UT system and given its current name.
The school grew greatly from the post-<a>World War II</a> era, largely under the influence of the <a>G.
I. Bill of Rights</a>, through the 1960s under the leadership of dean (later chancellor) Paul Meek.
It was noted that the school had almost as many entering freshmen in 1969 as it had overall students in 1961.
In 1961, it was the first campus in the University of Tennessee system to begin racial <a>desegregation</a>.
A large <a>experiment</a>al <a>farm</a> is operated, and there are several satellite campuses in West Tennessee (and one in <a>Middle Tennessee</a>).</p>
The school is among the top providers of candidates to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis.
Recent years have seen the demolition of old double-occupancy dormitory halls in favor of construction of apartment-style housing.</p>
<p>The university mascot was changed from &quot;Pacers&quot; to &quot;Skyhawks&quot; in 1995.
The reasoning behind the &quot;Skyhawks&quot; moniker was described thus:</p>
<li>The first educational institution on the site of UT Martin was Hall-Moody Bible Institute.
The school's athletic teams were called &quot;sky pilots&quot;, a frontier term for preachers in that day, but perhaps the students were thinking of the glamorous flying aces of World War I.</li>
<li>During World War II, UT Junior College contracted with the Naval War Training Service to help train pilots, who completed their flight training at an airport located on the current site of Westview High School.</li>
The name was changed in 1971, largely due to fact that, on account of the former junior college status of the school, the teams were often referred to as the &quot;Baby Vols.&quot;</p>
<p>Founded in 1928, <em>The Pacer</em> is the name of the <a>student newspaper</a>.
As of 2006, the newspaper has a <a>circulation</a> of 3,000 copies.
In the spring of 2006, the publication was won the distinction of being named &quot;Best in the South&quot; at the Southeastern Journalism Conference, beating out such schools as Vanderbilt and Mississippi State.
Throughout its history, the newspaper has also been named <em><a>The Checkerboard</a></em> and <em><a>The Volette</a></em>.</p>
