established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>UT Martin</strong> began in 1900 as <strong>Hall-Moody Institute</strong> in <a>Martin, Tennessee</a>, a Baptist junior college.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1927 the school was in danger of closing, and area civic and political leaders asked the state of <a>Tennessee</a> to step in and operate the school under the auspices of the University of Tennessee, which it did, renaming the institution the <strong>University of Tennessee Junior College</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%It operated under this name until 1951, when, with the addition of four-year fields of study leading to a <a>bachelor</a>'s degree, it was redesignated the <strong>University of Tennessee Martin Branch</strong>.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1967 it was designated as a primary campus of the UT system and given its current name.
established$$$@@@%%%The school grew greatly from the post-<a>World War II</a> era, largely under the influence of the <a>G.
established$$$@@@%%%I. Bill of Rights</a>, through the 1960s under the leadership of dean (later chancellor) Paul Meek.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university mascot was changed from &quot;Pacers&quot; to &quot;Skyhawks&quot; in 1995.
established$$$@@@%%%The reasoning behind the &quot;Skyhawks&quot; moniker was described thus:</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ul>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>The first educational institution on the site of UT Martin was Hall-Moody Bible Institute.
established$$$@@@%%%The school's athletic teams were called &quot;sky pilots&quot;, a frontier term for preachers in that day, but perhaps the students were thinking of the glamorous flying aces of World War I.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>During World War II, UT Junior College contracted with the Naval War Training Service to help train pilots, who completed their flight training at an airport located on the current site of Westview High School.</li>
mascot$$$@@@%%%<li>Red-tail hawks are indigenous to the West Tennessee region.</li>
image_name$$$@@@%%%</ul>
free$$$@@@%%%<p>Prior to being known as &quot;Pacers&quot; the university's teams were called &quot;Volunteers.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The name was changed in 1971, largely due to fact that, on account of the former junior college status of the school, the teams were often referred to as the &quot;Baby Vols.&quot;</p>
