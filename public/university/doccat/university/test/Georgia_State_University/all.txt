image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Campus expansion</h3>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>1913&#x2013;1975</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Over its 90-plus year history, Georgia State's growth has required the acquisition and construction of more space to suit its needs.
free_label$$$@@@%%%During the late 1960s/early 1970s, numerous buildings were constructed as part of a major urban renewal project, such as the Pullen Library (1966), Classroom South (1968), the expansion of the Pullen Library in 1968, the Arts and Humanities Building (1970), the ten-story General Classroom Building (1971), the <a>Sports Arena</a> (1973), and the twelve-story Urban Life Building (1974).
established$$$@@@%%%In addition, a raised plaza and walkway system was constructed to connect these buildings with each other over Decatur Street and parking structures.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>1980&#x2013;1989</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 1980s, another round of expansion took place with the acquisition of the former Atlanta Municipal Auditorium in 1979, which was subsequently converted into Alumni Hall in 1982, and currently houses Georgia State's administrative offices.
established$$$@@@%%%That same year, the <a>College of Law</a> was founded in the Urban Life Building, and the Title Building on Decatur Street was acquired and converted into the College of Education's headquarters and classroom space.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1988, the nine-story Library South was constructed on the south side of Decatur Street, which was connected to the Pullen Library via a three-story high foot bridge (officially referred to as a &quot;link&quot;) and effectively doubled the library's space.
established$$$@@@%%%The University Center was expanded in 1989 to include the University Bookstore Building, which also houses the Auxiliary Services Department.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>1990&#x2013;2004</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Georgia State continued this growth into the 1990s, with the expansion of Alumni Hall in 1991, the opening of the Natural Science Center in 1992, and the acquisition of the former <a>C&amp;S Bank</a> Building on Marietta Street in 1993, which is now the home of the Robinson College of Business.
established$$$@@@%%%Georgia State's first move into the <a>Fairlie-Poplar</a> district was the acquisition of the Rialto Theater in 1996.
free_label$$$@@@%%%In 1998, the Student Center was expanded toward Gilmer Street and provided a new 400-seat auditorium and space for exhibitions and offices for student clubs.
established$$$@@@%%%A new Student Recreation Center opened on the corner of Piedmont Avenue and Gilmer Street in 2001.
established$$$@@@%%%In 2002, the five-story high Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center opened on Luckie Street amid controversy over the demolition of historical buildings on its block.
established$$$@@@%%%Most recently, in 2004, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies was moved to the former Wachovia Bank Building at Five Points.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>2005&#x2013;today</h4>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>In 2006, the University announced a $1 billion campus expansion that will add over a dozen new buildings, including a new convocation center, science research park, new buildings for the schools of business and law, a new humanities building, and an expanded student recreation center.
mascot$$$@@@%%%Streetscape improvements are also included, such as improvements to Decatur Street and Piedmont Avenue, and dropping raised walkways to street level.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Sparks and Kell Halls will be torn down, with Sparks being torn down first to make way for the new humanities building.
faculty$$$@@@%%%Many projects are already underway, with a $20 million refurbishment to the Pullen Library complex completed during the 2006-07 school year.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The university has announced an expansion of their <a>Alpharetta</a> campus to include more classrooms and collaboration spaces, with work beginning heavily in 2010.
established$$$@@@%%%The university will add more than a dozen major new structures as it tries to accommodate an extra 10,000 full-time students projected to flow onto campus by 2015.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Several of those buildings, such as new on-campus student and Greek housing, a new convocation hall and an expanded athletic center, were included in GSU's new 10-year master plan with undergraduates in mind.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>By 2015, the university is expected to need about 1 million additional square feet of classroom, laboratory and other academic space for a total of 50,000 students, 36,000 of whom will attend full time.
established$$$@@@%%%Even the massive expansion will probably only meet about half that need, Patton said, although it should reduce GSU's dependence on leased space.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Two existing buildings in the heart of the campus will be razed and replaced with larger structures, including a new humanities center, which will join an updated library to form the university's new central hub.
established$$$@@@%%%GSU's buildout &mdash; which calls for nearly twice the dollar amount of new projects it completed over the previous decade &mdash; means the university is finally poised for a wave of new construction like that seen at The <a>University of Georgia</a> and <a>Georgia Tech</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The university is hemmed in by the Downtown Connector to the east, the Fairlie-Poplar district to the west and the government district to the south, so many of the new buildings will be built in the area immediately north, which includes part of the Sweet Auburn district.
established$$$@@@%%%A key component of this expansion will be the new building for GSU's business school, set to open in 2015.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h3>Housing</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>For much of its history, Georgia State was a commuter school with no on-campus or university-owned housing.
established$$$@@@%%%After the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a> were held in Atlanta, Georgia State acquired the 2,000-bed Olympic Village housing complex located at the southeast corner of Centennial Olympic Park Drive (formerly Techwood Drive) and <a>North Avenue</a> that was used to board Olympic athletes during the Games.
established$$$@@@%%%In August 2002, the 450-bed University Lofts opened at the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Courtland Street on the northeast side of campus as housing for graduate students, undergraduates over the age of twenty-one, and honors students.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On August 10, 2007, Georgia State opened the University Commons, a <a>$</a>165 million complex housing 1,992 students, occupying a city block bounded by Ellis Street, Piedmont Avenue, John Wesley Dobbs Avenue and Jesse Hill Jr. Drive.
established$$$@@@%%%A GSU economics professor estimated the new dorm could have an economic impact of $10&#x2013;12 million on <a>downtown Atlanta</a>.</p>
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%<p>In the fall of 2009, Georgia State opened a 350-bed residence hall exclusively for freshman students.
established$$$@@@%%%Located on the corner of Piedmont and Edgewood Avenues, Freshman Hall (as it is called) is conveniently located in close proximity to the heart of the GSU campus.
established$$$@@@%%%One notable feature in the Freshman Hall is Georgia State's first cafeteria-style dining facility.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This dining hall is open to all GSU students who have purchased the meal plan and features a wide assortment of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>For the 2010 academic year, Georgia State opened its Greek Housing facility, located adjacent to Freshman Hall on Edgewood Avenue.
established$$$@@@%%%Each townhome in the complex features a chapter room and kitchen, as well as a varying amount of beds.
established$$$@@@%%%Also included in the complex is a community laundry facility.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Most recently, following its plan for expansion, Georgia State acquired two hotels in downtown Atlanta, the Wyndham Garden Hotel and Baymont Inn and Suites on Piedmont Avenue, which will be renovated and changed into dorms, contributing to the university's transformation into a 24/7 community in the heart of the city.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%The complex will, upon completion, include living and study space for nearly 1,000 students, as well as greenspace and recreational areas and a brand new dining hall.
established$$$@@@%%%To cope with changes in its student population, the fastest growing one in the University System of Georgia, Georgia State is pursuing increased expansion through the potential acquisition or construction of buildings in the downtown Atlanta area.
