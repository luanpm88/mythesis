established$$$@@@%%%Normal and Training School, early-[[1910s]]]]At a meeting held on June 28, 1889, it was decided that the location of the new normal school would be on land known as &quot;the former athletic grounds&quot;, bounded on the north by Court Street, on the east by Wells Street, on the south by Brinkerhoff Street, and on the west by Beekman Street.
established$$$@@@%%%However these original plans were dropped in favor of a larger plot created by combining land on each side of Court Street west of Beekman Street, so that &quot;Court Street, one of the finest residence streets in the village, leads directly to the main entrance&quot;.
nickname$$$@@@%%%This is the same location where Hawkins Hall now rests on the current campus of SUNY Plattsburgh.&lt;sup&gt;<a>modern

established$$$@@@%%%<p>The impressive structure, known as &quot;Normal Hall&quot;, was constructed by Brown Brothers of <a>Mohawk, New York</a>, who also built the Court House in downtown Plattsburgh.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School officially opened with its first day of classes on the morning of September 3, 1890.
established$$$@@@%%%The school's first principal was Fox Holden, former Superintendent of the Plattsburgh Union Graded Schools.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With an extensive shuffling of city services, classes were able to resume the following Wednesday at City Hall in downtown.
established$$$@@@%%%The longer term solution was to share facilities with a number of the city's <a>K-12</a> public schools.
established$$$@@@%%%These half-day schooling arrangements were necessary for the survival of Plattsburgh Normal School but proved to be too disruptive to public school students, and the practice was discontinued in September 1930.</p>
former_names$$$@@@%%%<p>By that time initial plans were finally being approved for a new structure to replace Normal Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%Plans were formally approved on October 10.
established$$$@@@%%%The new building would be located in the same location and be twice as large as the old Normal Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%The new structure was completed in 1932 and was named <a>Hawkins Hall</a> in honor of George K. Hawkins, the principal of Plattsburgh Normal School from 1898 to 1933.

established$$$@@@%%%In 1998, Oswego <a>goaltender</a> Carl Antifonario  <a>shutout</a> the Cardinals in Plattsburgh, denying fans the opportunity to throw any tennis balls.

established$$$@@@%%%The SUNY Plattsburgh tradition of throwing tennis balls at home games against Oswego lasted for 18 years but, following Oswego's lead two years earlier, it was finally ended by school administrators on January 25, 2008.
