<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Main Entrance, Center for Business &amp; Graduate Studies</a> Bowie State's history began in 1865 when the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People established the Baltimore Normal School in <a>Baltimore</a>, <a>Maryland</a> to train African American teachers.
In 1908 the school was renamed Normal School No. 3 after the state Board of Education provided funding for and assumed control of the institution.</p>
<p>By 1914 the school had moved to <a>Prince George's County</a>, <a>Maryland</a> and become known as the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie.
From 1911 until 1921, <a>Don Speed Smith Goodloe</a> served as principal and in 1914-15 built the <a>Don S. S. Goodloe House</a>, which was added in 1988 to the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
It became the Maryland State Teachers College at Bowie in 1935 and Bowie State College in 1963.
Leonidas S. James</strong>, a two-year professional curriculum in teacher education was created and was later expanded to a three-year program.
A four-year program was created in 1935 for the training of elementary school teachers.
With approval from the State Board of Education, the program was expanded in 1951 to include training for junior high school teachers.
Ten years later, a teacher-training program for secondary education was established.
In 1963, a liberal arts program was started..</p>
<p>Bowie State College was authorized to grant its first graduate degree, a Master of Education, in 1970.
The school's first doctoral program was also in the field of education, with a Doctorate of Educational Leadership, earned by 16 students during the May 2005 commencement.
Other recent additions to the campus include the Christa McAuliffe Residential Community (CMRC) apartments, the Computer Science Building, a state-of-the-art facility serving the computer science and computer technology programs, and the $6.5 million Center for Learning Technology (CLT), serving the College of Professional Studies.</p>

<p>In September 2007, the University began negotiations with Prince George's County for the transfer of  of land to the school.
According to county documents, the land, valued at $1.3 million, would cost the University nothing if used &quot;for educational uses including facilities that benefit the welfare of students and faculty in their educational experience at the University.&quot;
The addition of this land would increase the size of the university by 63%.
<p>The Department of Public Safety (BSUDPS, BSUPD or Campus Police) is the primary law enforcement agency for the university and is charged with the protection of life and property in its 338.5-acre (1.37-km&#x00b2;) jurisdiction.
<p>The BSUPD started its tenure as a security force at the university's conception on April 8, 1908 at the &quot;Maryland Normal and Industrial School in Bowie&quot; with an initial endowment of  of campus property.</p>
