<p>The area around the old University building (the <a>University Square</a>), adjacent to the <a>C.
A. Rosetti</a>, Roman, <a>Kog&#x0103;lniceanu</a>, and Union Squares was the scene of many riots, protests and clashes with the <a>security forces</a> during the <a>Romanian Revolution of 1989</a>.
During the months of April-June 1990, the University of Bucharest was the centre of <a>anti-communist</a> protests.

The University of Bucharest was one of the first universities in the country that highlighted the importance of lifelong learning programmes.
An important part in the rapid development of continuing-education (life-long learning) programmes is played by the CREDIS department, which offered methodology and infrastructure for the functioning of those programmes, or at least supported certain faculties during the first years when those programmes came into force.
By means of its continuing-education (life-long learning) programmes, the University of Bucharest proves its capacity of adjustment to the dynamic requirements on the labor market, answering important social needs and ensuring increasingly bigger self-financing.</p>

<h3>The University Museum</h3>
<p>For the Greeks, the museum signified the place dedicated to the inspiring muses of the arts and letters...
In times to come, the museums that had been founded&#x2014;as some sort of sanctuaries of history, art and culture that wanted to be preserved&#x2014;had structured their themes on several categories: archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, folklore, history, cultural, military, natural history, as well as the history of art, technology and science.</p>
This is what the Museum of the University of Bucharest has set out to be ever since September 1967, the year of its foundation, when Academy member Gheorghe Mihoc, Rector of the University at that time, ordered &#x201c;the foundation of a public collection comprising documentary material, original pieces or significant copies, in view of a scientific reconstitution of the history of this University, with the Rector&#x2019;s Office at the University of Bucharest and within its budget.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Located on the ground floor of the left pavilion in the Palace of the Faculty of Law, the Museum has reached a valuable collection made up of 2486 pieces, most of them out of donations of its own teaching staff, former graduates: prints, documents, rare books, pictures, paintings, furniture, medals, plaques, and various thematic accessories.</p>
<p>The visitor has the opportunity to go through the complicated itinerary of the evolution of Romanian education, with the aid of original documents which mark the evolution of the University of Bucharest from its very foundation.
<p>Students have free access to the offices and main buildings of the &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; Central University Library (Biblioteca Central&#x0103; Universitar&#x0103; &#x201e;Carol I&#x201d;), which is the first large university library in Romania to have introduced an integrated computerized system.
<p>Offering a permanent dynamics of cultural and educational traditions, which has defined it since the beginning, BCU &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; was inaugurated, on March 14, 1865, as Royal Foundation.</p>
<p>BCU is an integrated library structure, be comprissed of the Central Unit, with an encyclopaedic profile, and 14 libraries organised as specialized branches, which function within the faculties of the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>Consequently, the current publication fund has a similar encyclopaedic structure, the library owning a total fund of over 1,900,000 volumes from different domains: literature, philosophy, law, psychology, history, geography-geology, management, economics, mathematics, etc.</p>
Moreover, one can read here the Chemical Abstracts, one of the centralizing catalogues, with summaries in the field of Chemistry.
<p>Through the INTERNET services, the BCU &#x201c;Carol I&#x201d; network is integrated into the dynamics of the world circuit of information.
14 libraries function within the faculties of the University of Bucharest, its branches specializing in different domains: literature, philosophy, law, psychology, history, geography-geology, management, economics, and mathematics; the current publication fund consists of over 1,000,000 volumes.</p>
<p>One of the main objectives the University pays great attention to is international academic cooperation.
<p>Its intense international activity makes the University of Bucharest makes the University of Bucharest increasingly more notorious in Europe and worldwide.
Another ERASMUS objective is encouraging the cooperation between universities in Europe in the field of higher-education.
The development of the European dimension of graduate and post-graduate studies is supported through ERASMUS, since the programme covers all disciplines and study areas within the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ERASMUS programme is to facilitate the creation of European unity and identity by means of study travel from one country to another.
Travel favors direct contact between people and cultures.
They offer you the opportunity of speaking another language, of tasting unknown dishes, of seeing new landscapes, of observing how the trade you train for is learned in another country, with a different history, with other customs, with a different social structure.
The University is also a member in several European and international academic organizations &#x2013; the European Universities Association (EUA), the University Agency for Francophony (AUF), the Association of Universities from European Capital Cities (UNICA), and the Black Sea University Network (BSUN).
