<p><strong>Tongji University</strong> (<a>Simplified Chinese</a>: &#x540c;&#x6d4e;&#x5927;&#x5b66;; <a>Traditional Chinese</a>: &#x540c;&#x6fdf;&#x5927;&#x5b78;; <a>Pinyin</a>: T&#x00f3;ngj&#x00ec; D&#x00e0;xu&#x00e9;),  colloquially known as <strong><a>Tongji</a></strong> (<strong>&#x540c;&#x6d4e;</strong>, T&#x00f3;ngj&#x00ec;), located in the northeast part of the <a>Shanghai</a> city, has more than 70,000 students and 8,008 staff members (1 September 2007).
As one of the oldest modern universities in China, Tongji was established in 1907 by the German government together with German physicians in Shanghai.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of Tongji University can be traced back to 1907 when the German Medical School for the Chinese in Shanghai was founded by the German government together with the German physicians Erich Paulun, Oscar von Schab and Paul Krieg.
The school was affiliated with the Tongji-Hospital the German physicians had established in Shanghai on the initiative of Paulun.
The name Tongji suggests cooperating by riding the same boat.
The school was expanded to include engineering in its programs and got its new name as German Medical and Engineering School for the Chinese in Shanghai in 1912.
It was formally established as a Chinese university under the name of Tongji University in 1923/1924 and was renamed as National Tongji University in 1927.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937&#x2013;1945), the university campus was moved from <a>Shanghai</a> first to <a>Zhejiang</a> Province, then to <a>Jiangxi</a> Province and <a>Yunnan</a> Province and later to <a>Sichuan</a> Province.
It was eventually moved back to <a>Shanghai</a> in 1946.
It then grew to be a comprehensive university which offered programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, and law.
Following a nationwide campaign of reorganizing schools and departments between universities in 1952, Tongji University became a university with strength in engineering, particularly in Civil Engineering.
<p>As a university which had established a reputation for its research, Tongji became one of the first batch of universities which were authorized by the China State Council to establish its Graduate School.
As one of the leading universities, it was successful in its application for the 211 Program which provided universities with substantial government fund.
In 1995, the university became one to be jointly supported by the State Education Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government.
The merger was acknowledged by the State Council as &quot;Tongji Model&quot; in the system renovation of higher institutions in China.
Now Tongji University has become a comprehensive university which offers a wide range of programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, law, economics and management.</p>
