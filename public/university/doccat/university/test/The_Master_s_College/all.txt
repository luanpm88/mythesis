established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Master's College was founded as Los Angeles Baptist Theological Seminary on May 25, 1927 to meet the need for a fundamentalist Baptist school on the West Coast.
established$$$@@@%%%The intention was to provide a biblical and Christ-centered education consistent with those doctrines of the historic <a>Christian</a> faith.</p>
affiliations$$$@@@%%%<p>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%William A. Matthews, pastor of Memorial Baptist Church of Los Angeles, became the founder and first president.
established$$$@@@%%%The seminary was extended an invitation to be temporarily housed at Calvary Baptist Church in the Los Angeles area.
