<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Master's College was founded as Los Angeles Baptist Theological Seminary on May 25, 1927 to meet the need for a fundamentalist Baptist school on the West Coast.
The intention was to provide a biblical and Christ-centered education consistent with those doctrines of the historic <a>Christian</a> faith.</p>
William A. Matthews, pastor of Memorial Baptist Church of Los Angeles, became the founder and first president.
The seminary was extended an invitation to be temporarily housed at Calvary Baptist Church in the Los Angeles area.
Several more moves followed until the seminary moved onto its own property in <a>Los Angeles</a> in 1942.</p>
<p><a>left|480px|thumb|TMC campus</a> Almost a year later, the school   acquired the Happy Jack Dude Ranch in the town of <a>Newhall</a>, approximately forty miles north of <a>Los Angeles</a>.
It comprised twenty-seven acres with a tree-shaded nucleus of seven buildings, some of which could be remodeled for college use.
By May 1961, the school occupied the main portion of the new campus.
The foreman&#x2019;s house became King Hall, which now houses the Student Life and Campus Activities offices.
H. Vider Hall, which now includes offices for several departments, was once used as a <a>dorm</a> for students, and before that a <a>barracks</a> for the &#x201c;dudes&#x201d; of the ranch.</p>
<p>The R. L. Powell Library, named after a faithful trustee of the school, became the first new building, dedicated in 1961.
Henry Vider supervised the construction of Rutherford Hall, what was then both the dining hall and administration building.
In February 1965, Hotchkiss Hall, named after faculty member Dr. Herbert V. Hotchkiss, became the first new student <a>dormitory</a>.</p>
<p>Under Dr. Dunkin&#x2019;s leadership, the college pursued accreditation by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.
Expansion of the college, including construction of Reese Academic Center, a new <a>science</a> and lecture hall, helped pave the way.
To facilitate accreditation of the undergraduate program, the seminary moved to <a>Tacoma</a>, <a>Washington</a> in 1974, resulting in the founding of <a>Northwest Baptist Seminary</a>.
Accreditation was granted in 1975.
<p>After twenty-five years of service Dr. Dunkin stepped down as president to become chancellor, and was appointed   President Emeritus in 1989.
The John R. Dunkin Student Center, a two-story complex overlooking Placerita Canyon, serves as a reminder of his   dedication..</p>
<p>In May 1985, <a>John MacArthur</a> became the next president of the college, in addition to his responsibilities as pastor-teacher at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California and Bible expositor on the <a>&#x201c;Grace to You&#x201d;</a> radio broadcast.
The name of the school was changed to The Master&#x2019;s College.
With the exposure of the college through MacArthur&#x2019;s radio ministry, the school became one of the fastest growing Christian colleges in America.</p>
<p>Initial planning for additional graduate programs for students at the College began soon after MacArthur became president.
<a>The Master's Seminary</a> started in 1986 with the specific goal of producing Bible expositors.
Richard L. Mayhue, the seminary has over three hundred students enrolled and is located  away on the grounds of <a>Grace Community Church</a>.
The seminary is steeped in the tradition of conservative, premillennial <a>Dispensationalism</a>.</p>
A number of cooperative study programs provide students with opportunities for off-campus learning experiences.
<p>The Master's College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation and the <a>U.S.
<p>Membership is maintained in:</p>

<p>The Master's College has developed one of the strongest Biblical Studies programs anywhere in the United States.
The Department of Biblical Studies stresses the understanding, interpretation, and application of biblical literature.
The biblical material is studied in light of its original historical environment so that an authentically biblical understanding can be applied to the theological and cultural issues of the modern age.
The department attempts to assist all students in developing a biblical worldview in which the principles and norms derived from the Word of God are applied to the whole of life.
<p>The Department of Biblical Studies provides guidance for the effective preparation for ministries of teachers, missionaries, church leaders, and other ministering personnel.
<p>The Master's Institute is a one-year, intensive Bible training program designed to aid the church in &quot;equipping the saints&quot; by providing students with a solid foundation in the Word of God.
The program consists of 32 units of Bible courses and upon completion a diploma in Biblical Studies will be awarded.
In addition, the Institute provides the opportunity to transfer into the baccalaureate program at The Master's College and still complete a bachelor's degree in four years.</p>
<h4>Certificate in <a>TESOL</a> (Tom Halstead)</h4>
<p>The purpose of the TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) Certificate program is to provide students with the theory, skills, and experience needed to competently instruct adult students in the skills of the English language.
<p>The Bible Exposition emphasis is a study of the Word of God in its entirety, and is specifically designed for those who desire to serve in Christian ministry or for those who plan to go on for graduate work or seminary.
The course of study trains students to counsel people in the local church.
It emphasizes the proper interpretation and specific application of Scripture in ministering to people.</p>
<p>The Biblical Languages emphasis consists of three years of Biblical Greek and one year of Hebrew, and is designed primarily for those desiring graduate work, either in seminary or in languages and Bible translation.</p>
It is designed for those students who desire to enter the educational program of the local church, including junior high, high school, or college.
It is also valuable for that student who desires the mission field, Christian school, or the teaching ministry.
Students will be required to study language, church planting, cultural anthropology, and missionary life while living on the mission field for one semester.
It is designed for those students who desire to further their education in seminary, and eventually serve in a pastoral or teaching capacity.
The department is composed of highly qualified faculty hailing from institutions such as Baylor College of Medicine, University of Southern California, University of Texas at Austin, Wayne State University, and Cal Poly.
The Master's College biology program is unique from most (even within Christian colleges) in that it adheres to a young-earth creation model as opposed to an old-earth evolution model.
