<p> <strong>London College of Fashion</strong> (<strong>LCF</strong>) is a constituent college of the <a>University of the Arts London</a>, offering <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>postgraduate</a>, short courses and business-training in <a>fashion</a>, make-up, beauty-therapy and lifestyle industries.
It is the only college in <a>Britain</a> to specialise in fashion education, research and consultancy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was originally founded by the former <a>London County Council</a> in 1906 as the <strong>Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls School</strong> and the <strong>Bartlett St and Clapham Trade School</strong>, which were opened to train young girls in the art of <a>dressmaking</a>, <a>millinery</a>, <a>embroidery</a> and <a>hairdressing</a>.
The London County Council was later abolished and replaced with the <a>Inner London Education Authority</a> until 1986.
The two institutions later amalgamated to form one college for the garment trades: London College of Fashion.
<strong>Cordwainers College</strong> is an integral school of the London College of Fashion.
The former head of college, Sandra Holtby, was awarded the <a>OBE</a> in the 2006 New Year's Honours.
The main college building at John Prince's Street is situated next to <a>Oxford Street</a>, just north of <a>Oxford Circus</a> which is primarily administrative aside from the Rootstein Hopkins Space, which is used to house various fashion shows and other fashion events.
Davies Street site was recently obtained by the council and demolished to make way for the Olympics crossrail.
The site at Lime Grove in west <a>London</a> houses specialist facilities for <a>photography</a>, <a>knitwear</a>, <a>embroidery</a> and <a>pattern cutting</a>.
<p>The London College of Fashion is a constituent college of the <a>University of the Arts London</a>, with <a>Camberwell College of Arts</a>, <a>Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design</a>, <a>Chelsea College of Art and Design</a>, <a>London College of Communication</a> and <a>Wimbledon College of Art</a>.</p>
<p>The short course department at LCF offers the greatest number of fashion short courses in London.
