website$$$@@@%%%<h3>University of Moral and Political Sciences</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Thammasat University began in 1934 as an open university called the <strong>University of Moral Science and Politics</strong> (UMPS; ); this was two years after <a>Siamese revolution of 1932</a> and eighteen years after <a>Chulalongkorn University</a> had been founded.
established$$$@@@%%%Thammasat University was the idea of <a>Pridi Banomyong</a>, architect of the 1932 coup and the then <a>Minister of Interior</a>, who drafted the <em>Act of University of Moral and Political Science 1934</em>.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was inaugurated on 27 June 1934, and Pridi served as the university's first rector.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The university is a result of the sixth principle of the Khana Ratsadon.
staff$$$@@@%%%The first announcement of Khana Ratsadon stated they &quot;must provide the people with full education&quot; because people &quot;lack education, which is reserved for royals&quot;.
established$$$@@@%%%The desire of students at the School of Law to see their institution upgraded to a university rather than simply a department at Chulalongkorn University also helped Thammasat University become the successor of the Law School.
established$$$@@@%%%The property and faculty of the Law School were transferred to University of Moral and Political Science, and the building of the old Law School was the first Thammasat site.
established$$$@@@%%%The university moved to Tha Phrachan campus the following year.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When the university opened, 7094 people applied for admission.
affiliation$$$@@@%%%At that time Chulalongkorn University was graduating only 68 students a year.
established$$$@@@%%%Thammasat initially offered a <a>bachelor's degree</a> with an emphasis on legal studies and previously banned <a>economics</a> and <a>political science</a>, plus a bachelor's degree equivalent diploma in accountancy.
students$$$@@@%%%<a>Master's degree</a> courses soon followed in <a>law</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>economics</a>, and <a>doctoral degree</a> courses in law, political science, economics, and diplomacy.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During its early years, the university did not rely on government funding, but instead relied on its low tuition fees and interest paid by the <a>Bank of Asia for Industry and Commerce</a>, in which the university owned 80 percent of the shares.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Under Pridi's leadership, the University became the clandestine headquarter of the <a>Free Thai</a> anti-Japanese underground during <a>the Second World War</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Ironically, the University campus also functioned as an interment camp for Allied civilians, with Thai guards more or less protecting them from abuses by the occupying Japanese.

established$$$@@@%%%The original Thammasat degree was replaced by specialised departments in 1949, when the Faculties of Law, Political Science, Commerce and Accountancy, and Economics were founded.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was forced to sell its bank shares, thus becoming dependent on government funding.
established$$$@@@%%%The words <em>and political</em> were removed from its name, and Thammasat was no longer an open university.
established$$$@@@%%%A new <em>Thammasat University Act</em> was passed in 1952.

mottoeng$$$@@@%%%This led to peaceful protests by  labor groups, students, and other activists demanding the expulsion of Thanom.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On 4 October, students staged a play on the Thammasat campus to dramatize the hanging of the protesters in Nakhon Pathom.
established$$$@@@%%%Several newspapers printed photographs of the mock hanging, however with one of the students retouched to resemble Crown Prince <a>Vajiralongkorn</a>, implying that the students had committed <a>l&#x00e8;se-majest&#x00e9;</a>.
