established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Gakush&#x016b;in University (Gakush&#x016b;in University Central Lecture Room).</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> is an elite higher educational institution in Mejiro, <a>Toshima</a>, <a>Tokyo</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It was re-established after <a>World War II</a> as an affiliate of the <a>Gakush&#x016b;in</a> School Corporation, the privatized successor to the original Gakush&#x016b;in University or &quot;Peers School&quot; set up during the <a>Meiji era</a> to educate the children of the <a>Japanese nobility</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Gakush&#x016b;in University is still one of the most prestigious universities in Japan, having most of the members of the present <a>Imperial Family</a> as former, present, or future students.
students$$$@@@%%%The average number of students has been kept low so that each one can receive personal attention from the staff.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The level of the academic staff (professors, lecturers, etc.) is considered to be equal to that of the staff of the famous <a>University of Tokyo</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Although the outlook of Gakush&#x016b;in is traditional, the education given there is extremely liberal, and the prevailing atmosphere is one of comradeship, toleration and broad-mindedness.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>This freedom of thought, combined with a lack of competition between students, has resulted in the fact that there are many well-known literary figures, artists, and diplomats among the alumni.
image_size$$$@@@%%%However, despite the high academic level, research work conducted at the University has not received much public attention, so that it is not well known outside of Japan.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As virtually all the instruction is conducted in Japanese, there are relatively few foreigners at Gakush&#x016b;in.
