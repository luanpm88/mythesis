<p>The <strong>University of Bamberg</strong> () in <a>Bamberg</a>, <a>Germany</a>, is simultaneously one of the oldest and one of the newest <a>universities</a> in <a>Bavaria</a>.
It specializes in the Humanities, Cultural Studies, Social Sciences, Economics and Applied Computer Science.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Bamberg was founded in 1647 under the name <em>Academia Bambergensis</em> by Prince-Bishop Melchior Otto Voit von Salzburg and was enlarged in the following century, particularly through the work of Prince-Bishop Friedrich Carl von Sch&#x00f6;nborn, to attain the status of a full university, including departments of <a>theology</a>, <a>philosophy</a>, <a>law</a> and <a>medicine</a>.</p>
<p>In 1803 the university was closed during the course of the <a>secularization</a> of the <a>diocese</a>.
However, Catholic theology could still be studied, thus, the traditional role as university was never actually interrupted.</p>
<p>In 1972 the College for Philosophy and Theology, which was founded in 1923 and was modeled on the tradition of the old university, was combined with the Teachers Training College (established in 1958) to become the Gesamthochschule of Bamberg (i.e. a University and a University of Applied Sciences combined in one institution).
In 1979 it was re-designated, having earned the title of University.
<p>The name Otto-Friedrich University was chosen in reference to the founder, Melchior Otto Veit von Salzburg, and to the important patron Friedrich Carl von Sch&#x00f6;nborn, both bishops of Bamberg.
Rectors and Presidents since the re-founding of the university:</p>
<li><a>Social Sciences</a>, <a>Business Administration</a> and <a>Economics</a></li>
<p>In light of the most recent agreements between the Free State of Bavaria and the Vatican, the faculty of Catholic Theology was to cease existence as a faculty and was instead restructured as an institute which will place a greater emphasis on teacher training.
In accordance with a decision made by a Bavarian parliamentary committee on June 2nd, 2005, the course Social Work has been transferred to the University of Applied Sciences in Coburg.</p>
<p>The Social Sciences and Economics department and the Business Information Technology and Applied Computer Science department, which accommodate a large proportion of the students, are to be found in the Feldkirchenstrasse buildings, which are not in the city center.</p>
