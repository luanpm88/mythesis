<h2>History</h2>
<p>Camosun College enrolled its first students in September 1971 when it opened as a two-year institution offering university transfer, vocational and upgrading courses to the residents of southern <a>Vancouver Island</a>.
The roots of the  College reach back as far as 1914 when the Young Building was built as Victoria's first Normal School on part of a seven and a half acre plot belonging to the <a>Hudson's Bay Company</a>.
The school's enrolment at the time was about 275.</p>
<p>During the second world war, the Young Building was converted into a military hospital.
It was not until 1946 that the  building was returned to its original function.
This time, however, it was shared by the Normal School and by Victoria College, which became united in 1955.</p>
<p>In 1967 the Normal School and Victoria College moved to the site of the Gordon Head Campus of the <a>University of Victoria</a> and the Institute of Adult Studies was established by the Greater Victoria School Board.
The Institute of Adult Studies made its home in the Ewing Building and became the first centre in Canada to offer daytime courses for adults wishing to upgrade to high school graduation.
From the inception of the Institute, local interest in a community college grew.
On October 9, 1970 Victoria residents voted in favour of establishing a college, and soon plans for &#x201c;<a>Juan de Fuca</a>&#x201d; College were underway.
The provincial government formally approved the college on October 27, 1970.</p>
<p>In 1971 the college councilors voted on a name change, and &#x201c;Camosun&#x201d; (pronounced Cam-O-sun) was chosen, as it was an early name for Victoria.
By September 1971 the final steps toward the realization of a college were taken when Camosun (Lansdowne campus) and the BC Vocational School (Interurban campus) merged to become BC&#x2019;s ninth community college.</p>
<p>The trade-mark with the words <code>Camosun College</code> was filed with the <a>Canadian Intellectual Property Office</a> Canadian Trade-marks database on 2008-02-22.</p>
