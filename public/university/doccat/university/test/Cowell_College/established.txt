College with the [[Monterey Bay]] in the background]] The first of the ten <a>residential college</a>s of the <a>University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, established in 1965, <strong>Cowell College</strong> sits on the edge of a redwood forest with a remarkable view of <a>Monterey Bay</a>.
The college is named for <a>Henry Cowell</a> and the Cowell family, who donated the land that UCSC is built upon, previously known as the <a>Cowell Ranch</a>.</p>
<p>Cowell College features seven <a>dormitory</a> buildings which are named after American historians, and architecturally reminiscent of English schools.
Each building houses between 45 and 95 students in two clusters known as Upper Quad and Lower Quad.
Three buildings of apartments opened in 2004.
Each apartment houses six or seven students in several bedrooms that share a living room, kitchen, and bathrooms.
<p>These residence halls and apartments have <a>resident assistant</a>s that live in the buildings in order to offer some counseling, programming, and guidance to the students living in Cowell.
<p>In the past, another building known as La Maison Francophone housed approximately 15 students who met weekly to speak French, study French culture, and put on events for the college.
This building, located behind the Humanities and Social Sciences complex, now houses mostly teachers and graduate students, in addition to the Soviet Apartment, a communal living experiment occupied by students of the Russian language course.</p>
<p>Topped by a glass <a>cupola</a>, Cowell's dining hall is one of Cowell's best known visible features and has become one of the College's icons.
The dining hall serves as the primary eatery for Cowell and <a>Stevenson College</a>.
<h2>The Company of Friends</h2>
<p>Cowell College's motto is: <em>The Pursuit of Truth in the Company of Friends.</em>
This concept is embraced throughout the college, most in its efforts to foster smaller communities within the larger, to encourage personal development, and fostering interaction between students of all disciplines.
As the collegiate system was brought to UC Santa Cruz in order to help create a small college feel at a major university, so too was Cowell designed with two quads of small buildings to further break up the College into clusters of students.
<p>Cowell College has had a long history of promoting diversity on campus.
Prominent in the center of the college, overlooking the fountain, is a mural commissioned by the Multicultural Advisory Board, a group that sponsored and encouraged multicultural awareness on campus for many years.
<p>Parrington House, one of the residence halls at Cowell, has also been dubbed the Diversity Awareness House, and encourages Cowell residents to come together to promote diversity in the University.
<p>In the 2005-06 academic year, a new group, the Diversity Encouragement Council (DEC), was founded with the aim of hosting events with the intent of engaging student dialogues on pressing issues around diversity.</p>
<p>Cowell is home to a wide variety of events, including College Night, a Cowell tradition since the first Thursday night dinner of UCSC in September 1965.
Themes range from Japanese cuisine with Japanese <a>taiko</a> drums to <a>Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a> performances, to student talent shows.
Free to sign up for students living at Cowell, this program offers an ever growing number of DVDs for residents to check out for a week.
The group recently put on a large free show at Cowell called Acquirefest featuring all three on campus a cappella groups and some other guest groups.
<p>As the first of the colleges to be built, Cowell is placed very strategically on the campus to have one of the best views of the Monterey Bay Area.
The view from the Cowell Breezeway and courtyard extends to <a>Monterey</a> and <a>Carmel</a> to the south on a clear day.
This open patio is home to several College Nights a year, and in 2002, was voted the Best Place to Study on campus by City on a Hill Press.</p>
<p>It is also home to the <a>Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery</a>[<a>http://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith_gallery/</a>],
named in honor of the wife of Cowell's first Provost, <a>Page Smith</a>.
Cowell's library, housing a small private collection of books, and another popular study spot, is named in his honor.
In addition, Cowell owns many sculptures displayed around its campus, including the Cowell fountain and a statue dedicated to students who died in the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
<p>Dating from the days of the old ranch, Cowell houses a <a>Printing Press</a>.
It also serves bagels and cream cheese from Santa Cruz's own Bagelry, and has some of the best muffins on campus.
