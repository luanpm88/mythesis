established$$$@@@%%%College with the [[Monterey Bay]] in the background]] The first of the ten <a>residential college</a>s of the <a>University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, established in 1965, <strong>Cowell College</strong> sits on the edge of a redwood forest with a remarkable view of <a>Monterey Bay</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The college is named for <a>Henry Cowell</a> and the Cowell family, who donated the land that UCSC is built upon, previously known as the <a>Cowell Ranch</a>.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>Living at Cowell</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cowell College features seven <a>dormitory</a> buildings which are named after American historians, and architecturally reminiscent of English schools.
established$$$@@@%%%Each building houses between 45 and 95 students in two clusters known as Upper Quad and Lower Quad.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The buildings are named as follows: Adams, Prescott, Parkman (upper quad); Beard, Parrington, Turner (lower quad); and Morison (though Morison's front entrance opens onto the lower quad, whether the dorm is upper or lower quad is a source of debate.)
established$$$@@@%%%Three buildings of apartments opened in 2004.
established$$$@@@%%%Each apartment houses six or seven students in several bedrooms that share a living room, kitchen, and bathrooms.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>These residence halls and apartments have <a>resident assistant</a>s that live in the buildings in order to offer some counseling, programming, and guidance to the students living in Cowell.
mascot$$$@@@%%%There are two resident assistants for each dormitory and five resident assistants for the apartments.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the past, another building known as La Maison Francophone housed approximately 15 students who met weekly to speak French, study French culture, and put on events for the college.
established$$$@@@%%%This building, located behind the Humanities and Social Sciences complex, now houses mostly teachers and graduate students, in addition to the Soviet Apartment, a communal living experiment occupied by students of the Russian language course.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Topped by a glass <a>cupola</a>, Cowell's dining hall is one of Cowell's best known visible features and has become one of the College's icons.
established$$$@@@%%%The dining hall serves as the primary eatery for Cowell and <a>Stevenson College</a>.
head_label$$$@@@%%%This building has reopened following retrofitting during the 2008 school year.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h2>The Company of Friends</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Cowell College's motto is: <em>The Pursuit of Truth in the Company of Friends.</em>
established$$$@@@%%%This concept is embraced throughout the college, most in its efforts to foster smaller communities within the larger, to encourage personal development, and fostering interaction between students of all disciplines.
established$$$@@@%%%As the collegiate system was brought to UC Santa Cruz in order to help create a small college feel at a major university, so too was Cowell designed with two quads of small buildings to further break up the College into clusters of students.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Thus, Cowell works to create a feeling of &quot;home&quot; while living here.</p>
