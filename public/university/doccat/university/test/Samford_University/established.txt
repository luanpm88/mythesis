<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|450px|thumb|Bird's-eye view of the campus</a>Samford was founded as <strong>Howard College</strong> in 1841 and opened its doors to students on January 3, 1842, in <a>Marion, Alabama</a>.
In 1887 the school relocated to the East Lake community of Birmingham.
Howard College was named for <a>Christian</a> prison reformer, <a>John Howard</a>.</p>
<p>Women were first admitted to Howard College in 1895, and the college officially became coeducational in 1913.
One year later the school established its Teacher Education Division.
<p>In 1961, the school acquired the <a>Cumberland School of Law</a> from <a>Cumberland University</a> in <a>Lebanon</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>.</p>
On June 11, 1953 Howard College broke ground on its third campus in the Shades Valley just south of Birmingham.
The school occupied its new campus in 1957.</p>
The school was renamed in honor of Frank Park Samford, chairman of the Board of Trustees and up to that time, the institution's most generous individual benefactor.
(In addition, there was also a <a>Howard University</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>.)</p>
<p>The Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing, owned by the Baptist Medical Center of Birmingham, was added to the University in 1973.
In 1988, the <a>Beeson Divinity School</a> was established through donations from Ralph W. Beeson.</p>
<p>The University consists of the Howard College of Arts and Sciences, Brock School of Business, Orlean Bullard Beeson School of Education and Professional Studies, School of Performing Arts, Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing, McWhorter School of Pharmacy, Beeson School of Divinity, and <a>Cumberland School of Law</a>.</p>
<p>On January 29, 2004, in his Founder's Day Address, then-President Thomas E. Corts announced a multi-year improvement plan called, &quot;The Promise.&quot;
According to Dr. Corts, &quot;Samford University will be an academically vigorous Christian university that coordinates a strong, effective educational program and encouragement of Christian belief and service, within a community that respects its individual members and encourages each to highest and best levels of performance and conduct -- academically, socially, spiritually, physically.&quot;</p>

<p>The plan calls for Samford to invest some $200 million to &quot;enrich and enhance the educational experience of its students.&quot;
Since June 1, 2003 more than $37 million has been contributed in philanthropic gifts toward the campaign.</p>
<p>As a private, <a>segregated</a> institution, Samford University was to some degree insulated from the activities of leaders and protesters of the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1950s and early 1960s.
Birmingham was the site of demonstrations led by the <a>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) and Dr. <a>Martin Luther King</a> to end segregation of public facilities and open city jobs to minorities.
The era was marked by nationally covered protests and the deaths of four young African-American girls in the bombing of a Birmingham church.</p>
<p>A growing core of Samford faculty and students opposed segregation, and at one point the officers of the Samford Student Government Association challenged a segregated concert held on campus by the Alabama Symphony by inviting as their guests the student government officers of nearby <a>Miles College</a>, a black school.
Eventually, maintenance of segregation by private universities was ended by the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by the <a>US Congress</a>.
<a>Cumberland School of Law</a> faced the greatest immediate risk of losing accreditation.
It admitted Samford's first black student, <a>Audrey Lattimore Gaston</a>, in 1967.

He served as president of the <a>Kmart</a> pharmacy operations for 17 years.</p>
