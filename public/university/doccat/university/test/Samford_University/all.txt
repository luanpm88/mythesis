faculty$$$@@@%%%<h2>Civil rights</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>As a private, <a>segregated</a> institution, Samford University was to some degree insulated from the activities of leaders and protesters of the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1950s and early 1960s.
established$$$@@@%%%Birmingham was the site of demonstrations led by the <a>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) and Dr. <a>Martin Luther King</a> to end segregation of public facilities and open city jobs to minorities.
established$$$@@@%%%The era was marked by nationally covered protests and the deaths of four young African-American girls in the bombing of a Birmingham church.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A growing core of Samford faculty and students opposed segregation, and at one point the officers of the Samford Student Government Association challenged a segregated concert held on campus by the Alabama Symphony by inviting as their guests the student government officers of nearby <a>Miles College</a>, a black school.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The combined delegation was turned away by university officials.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>University president Leslie Stephen Wright resisted integration, but Samford's &quot;whites-only&quot; policy threatened Federal student aid and institutional accreditation.
established$$$@@@%%%Eventually, maintenance of segregation by private universities was ended by the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by the <a>US Congress</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Cumberland School of Law</a> faced the greatest immediate risk of losing accreditation.
established$$$@@@%%%It admitted Samford's first black student, <a>Audrey Lattimore Gaston</a>, in 1967.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%The entire university proceeded to become integrated.</p>
