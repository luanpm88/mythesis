Francis Xavier College was a Roman Catholic institution founded at Arichat, NS, in 1853.
The university was moved in 1855 from Arichat, NS to its present location in <a>Antigonish, Nova Scotia</a>.</p>

<p>In 1894, the academy affiliated with St Francis Xavier University as Mount St Bernard College.
<p>In 1897 the school became the first co-educational Catholic university in North America to grant degrees to women.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.</p>

Francis Xavier University is known for its distinctive X-Ring, awarded to students on December 3 of each year before their graduation.
December 3 marks the feast day of the University's patron saint and namesake, Saint <a>Francis Xavier</a>.
On average, more than 95% of the graduating class opt for the ring.</p>
<p>The X-Ring is presented to students in a ceremony during the afternoon, which only recipients may attend.
Traditionally, this ceremony was held in the University Chapel; however, in recent years it has been hosted in the <a>Charles V. Keating Millennium Centre</a>.
There is typically a live video link of the ceremony available for family and friends to watch from across the world or from a large screen set up in the Oland Centre on campus.</p>
This ensures that if an X-Ring is ever lost, the finder can send it back to the University and the original owner can be traced.
