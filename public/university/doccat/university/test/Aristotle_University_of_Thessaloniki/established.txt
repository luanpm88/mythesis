<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was founded in 1925 during the premiership of <a>Alexandros Papanastassiou</a>.
It was the second Greek university at that time, following the <a>University of Athens</a>, and its establishment was legislated under Law 3341/14-6-25.</p>
<p>According to <a>Eleftherios Venizelos'</a> plans right after the end of the First World War, <a>Smyrni</a> was intended to be the seat of the second Greek university, while the third university was to be established in <a>Thessaloniki</a>.
However, Smyrni was not part of Greece at that time and these plans fell through after the outcome of the <a>Greco-Turkish War</a> in <a>Asia Minor</a>.
Nevertheless, in 1924 Alexandros Papanastassiou decided to found a university in Northern Greece in order to boost the local economy and culture .</p>
<p>The chronological development of the University, which was renamed the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1954, can be divided into three stages, each covering a period of approximately twenty-five years.</p>
<p>During the first stage of its operation (1926&#x2013;1950), the development focused on those Schools which were generally accepted as constituting one educational Institute, namely the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Law and Economics, the School of Theology and the <a>Medical School</a>.
The first stage of development ended with the foundation of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1950, which was the only faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Greece for many years.
After this period, some of the aforementioned faculties were extended by integrating more departments.
In more detail, the Departments of <a>Pharmacy</a> and <a>Dentistry</a> were founded in 1955 and 1959 respectively and they were incorporated into the Medical School.
Moreover, the Faculty of Philosophy was expanded by integrating the Institutes of Foreign Languages (English, French, German and Italian).</p>
<p>During the second stage (1951&#x2013;1975) the focal point of development was the Faculty of Engineering, also known as the <a>Polytechnic</a> Faculty.
Therefore, for the first fifty years of its operation the Aristotle University consisted of two distinct institutes which operated independently.
The various Schools within the Faculty of Engineering were founded in the following order: School of Civil Engineering (1955&#x2013;56), School of Architecture (1956&#x2013;57), School of Rural and Surveying Engineering (1962&#x2013;63), School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (1972&#x2013;73), School of Chemical Engineering (1972&#x2013;73), School of Mathematics, Physics and Computational Sciences (1982&#x2013;83) and School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering (2004).
The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was split in two independent schools (School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 1976.</p>
<p>Finally, during the third stage of its development (1975-today), new Schools and Departments were founded along with the aforementioned Engineering Schools.
<p>The Aristotle University is one of Greece's <a>public Universities</a> and therefore it is a legal entity with full <a>self governance</a>.
It is primarily state-funded and functions under the supervision of the Greek <a>Ministry</a> of National Education and Religious Affairs.
Main objective of the administration's efforts is to ensure the proper function of the university and pursuit the benefit of the academic community as a whole.</p>
A school covers a basic scientific area and thus is considered to be the basic academic unit.
<h4>University Senate</h4>
<p>The highest administrative authority is the <strong>University Senate</strong>.

<li>Representatives of the <a>associate professor</a>s, <a>assistant professor</a>s and <a>lecturer</a>s.</li>
<li>Representatives of the Special Laboratory Teaching Staff and the Administrative Staff.</li>
Moreover, he/she is responsible for developing an overall strategy for the development of the university and for implementing the decisions taken by the Senate and the Rector's Council.
<p>Every <a>faculty</a>, school and <a>department</a> has its own administrative body, the members of which are democratically elected on the basis of collective processes .
The decision making process often involves the creation of ad hoc committees.</p>
