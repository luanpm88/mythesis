established$$$@@@%%%building of the LDS Church's [[Laie Hawaii Temple]] was a key predecessor to the establishment of BYU&#x2013;Hawaii.]]
established$$$@@@%%%The LDS Church was established in the islands in 1850 following the <a>Edict of Toleration</a> promulgated by <a>Kamehameha III</a>, giving the underground <a>Hawai&#x2018;i Catholic Church</a> the right to worship while at the same time allowing other faith traditions to begin establishing themselves.
established$$$@@@%%%By 1919, the Church was prominent enough in the area for the church to build a <a>temple</a> in <a>Laie</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Two years after the temple was dedicated then-<a>apostle</a> for the LDS Church <a>David O. McKay</a> stated that the Church would build a school in the area in the future.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1951, McKay, now <a>President of the Church</a>, began preliminary plans on the school, and in 1954 ground was broken for the new university.
established$$$@@@%%%BYU-H was founded in September 1955 as <strong>Church College of Hawaii</strong> to accommodate the burgeoning LDS population in the <a>Territory of Hawai&#x2018;i</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%This was largely a result of McKay's views on both education and strengthening the Church outside of its longtime inter-Mountain West U.S. base.
established$$$@@@%%%The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old <a>World War II</a> buildings, with <a>Reuben D. Law</a> as the school's first president.

country$$$@@@%%%<p> [[Image:BYUH mahalo.jpg|thumb|right|A
undergrad$$$@@@%%%sign reminds students of [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|BYU-H Honor Code]] standards]] All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an <a>honor code</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the <a>Brigham Young Academy</a> and educator <a>Karl G. Maeser</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization,&quot; which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and <a>academic dishonesty</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>Ernest L. Wilkinson</a> expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards.
free$$$@@@%%%(At this time, Wilkinson, as President of BYU, had some authority over BYU&#x2013;Hawaii as well.)
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%This led to the Honor Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol.
established$$$@@@%%%A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council.
faculty$$$@@@%%%In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.
established$$$@@@%%%One significant difference between BYU's Honor Code and BYU&#x2013;Hawaii's is BYU-H's prohibition of the drinking of <a>kava</a> by students and faculty.
vice_chancellor$$$@@@%%%Kava is a traditional Polynesian drink with some drug-like side-effects.</p>
