<p><strong>Brigham Young University&#x2013;Hawaii</strong> (BYU-H) is a private, undergraduate co-educational <a>university</a> in <a>Laie</a>, <a>City and County of Honolulu</a>, <a>Hawaii</a>, <a>United States</a>, thirty-five miles from the center of <a>Honolulu</a> on the windward coast of the island of <a>Oahu</a>.
The university educates approximately 2,400 students from Asia, the Pacific islands, the U.S., and other parts of the world, representing over 70 countries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
building of the LDS Church's [[Laie Hawaii Temple]] was a key predecessor to the establishment of BYU&#x2013;Hawaii.]]
The LDS Church was established in the islands in 1850 following the <a>Edict of Toleration</a> promulgated by <a>Kamehameha III</a>, giving the underground <a>Hawai&#x2018;i Catholic Church</a> the right to worship while at the same time allowing other faith traditions to begin establishing themselves.
By 1919, the Church was prominent enough in the area for the church to build a <a>temple</a> in <a>Laie</a>.
Two years after the temple was dedicated then-<a>apostle</a> for the LDS Church <a>David O. McKay</a> stated that the Church would build a school in the area in the future.
In 1951, McKay, now <a>President of the Church</a>, began preliminary plans on the school, and in 1954 ground was broken for the new university.
BYU-H was founded in September 1955 as <strong>Church College of Hawaii</strong> to accommodate the burgeoning LDS population in the <a>Territory of Hawai&#x2018;i</a>.
This was largely a result of McKay's views on both education and strengthening the Church outside of its longtime inter-Mountain West U.S. base.
The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old <a>World War II</a> buildings, with <a>Reuben D. Law</a> as the school's first president.
The school's first buildings were dedicated on December 17, 1958.
The college was at first a two-year college but was reorganized in 1959 to become a four-year college.
By 1961 the College had been granted four-year accreditation by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.
The school was also listed as the #1 &quot;best value&quot; in the region and was the only Hawaiian school to make a top-tier listing.
It was the eighth year BYU-H had been listed as among the top ten in its region.
The school also offers a few unique majors, including Hawaiian Studies, International Business Management, Pacific Islands Studies, and TESOL.</p>
<p>BYU-H is located in Laie on the north shore of Oahu, about 35 miles north of Honolulu.
The campus covers  between the mountains and the ocean shore.
Dormitories capable of providing room and board for over 1,200 students in the Hale buildings located on the south end of campus.
The school's library is the two-story <a>Joseph F. Smith</a> Library.</p>
<p>BYU-H competes in the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (<a>NCAA</a>) Division II as a member of the <a>Pacific West Conference</a>.
In its early days, BYU-H also won a National Rugby Championship in 1967, as declared by the <a>Los Angeles</a> Rugby Union.
<p> According to BYU-H's Mission Statement, the school &quot;exists to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and <a>eternal life</a> and in their efforts to influence the establishment of peace internationally.&quot;</p>
Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the <a>Brigham Young Academy</a> and educator <a>Karl G. Maeser</a>.
Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization,&quot; which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and <a>academic dishonesty</a>.
<a>Ernest L. Wilkinson</a> expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards.
A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff.
One significant difference between BYU's Honor Code and BYU&#x2013;Hawaii's is BYU-H's prohibition of the drinking of <a>kava</a> by students and faculty.
