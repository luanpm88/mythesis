NIFA consists of 80 college teams and only 3 of the colleges do not provide their teams with aircraft, Metro being one.
Regardless, these pilots are highly motivated and take pride in the team; not only do they dedicate many hours to the team by organizing and running fund raising events, attending practices every week, recruiting, and traveling to competitions but they also attend Metro and pay for addition training (Private, IFR, Comm, CFI ratings) required to graduate as Aviation Technology Majors.</p>
<p>Current majors offered at Metro State's aviation and aerospace department include professional pilot and aviation airport management studies.</p>
The executive branch includes the popularly-elected SGA President, Vice-President, Student Trustee, and two Representatives to a panel known as the Student Advisory Committee to the Auraria Board (&quot;SACAB&quot;).
Directors are appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the Senate, and they serve at the pleasure of the President.
The President, in turn, is responsible for implementation and for regularly reporting to the Senate on the affairs of the student government.
Justices are appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the SGA Senate to serve perpetual terms (until they fall out of qualification or cease to be students at Metro State).
The SGA Election Commission is an autonomous panel responsible for administering student government elections.
