<p>  <strong>The Metropolitan State College of Denver</strong> (also known as <strong>Metro State</strong>) is a four-year <a>college</a> located in <a>Denver, Colorado</a>, <a>United States</a>.
With 54 majors and 90 minors, the college is noted for a wide array of liberal arts and sciences programs as well as its teacher education, business, aviation, and criminal justice programs.
Metro State is located on the <a>Auraria Campus</a>, along with the <a>University of Colorado Denver</a> and the <a>Community College of Denver</a>, in downtown Denver, adjacent to Speer Boulevard and Colfax Avenue.
<h2>History and geography</h2>

The campus is located at the former townsite of <a>Auraria</a>, which was founded in November 1858.
Denver was founded three weeks later on the opposing side (east side) of <a>Cherry Creek</a>.
<p>Auraria had a mix of residential areas and industrial areas through the mid-20th century.
When the campus was built, many Aurarians, a majority of them Hispanic, were displaced and the school promised to serve the community.
The historic Tivoli Brewery was a beer brewery on this site that was preserved and the <a>&quot;Tivoli&quot;</a> now serves as a <a>Student Union</a> to all three schools on the campus; among other things it is noted for being the site of a stage of the now-defunct <a>Coors Classic</a> world-class bicycle race.
The Emmanuel Gallery, which is the oldest synagogue structure in Denver, is on the campus as well.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan State College of Denver was founded in 1965 as an opportunity school.
The concept was that people from all walks of life could have a chance at a college education.
By design, Metro State is required to be accessible to all, which is why it consistently has some of the lowest tuitions of four-year Colorado <a>colleges</a> and <a>universities</a>.
Before becoming centralized on the downtown campus, Metro's classes were spread across Denver.
Students would only have fifteen minutes to go from class to class and would often run across busy streets in Denver, dodging traffic, to make it to class on time.
Hence students were referred to as roadrunners and a mascot was born.</p>
<p>Metro State has an extensive aviation-related facility known as the &quot;Seventh Street Building&quot; (due to its location on Seventh Street).
A project is under way to integrate <a>air traffic control</a> services and training into flight simulation training.</p>
<p>In addition, the Metro State Precision Flight Team is a member of NIFA (<a>National Intercollegiate Flying Association</a>) which is an association allowing university flight teams the opportunity to compete nationally in various flying categories of piloting.
<p>Metropolitan State College of Denver has an award-winning journalism department offering classes for photojournalism, print and broadcast journalism, and public relations.
<p>The department was founded by former award-winning reporter and editor Greg Pearson in the early 1970s.
Most of his former students went on to work in the journalism field as reporters, editors, publications people and public relations professionals.</p>
These awards include College Photographer of the Year from the Atlanta Photojournalism Conference in 2005 won by Evan Semon who was a member of the National Association for Hispanic Journalists and used his accomplishments to obtain a full-time staff position at the <a>Rocky Mountain News</a>.
Both of these students worked under former chair of the department and current photojournalism instructor Kenn Bisio.
<p>The <a>student government</a> at Metro State operates under the name &quot;Student Government Assembly&quot; (more commonly referred to as &quot;SGA&quot;), and it is composed of legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
The legislative branch is called the SGA Senate, and it is composed of ten senators popularly elected each Spring semester to serve one-year terms of office that begin on June 1.
These five officers form the core of a group called the Executive Committee, which also includes the Speaker of the Senate and five additional executive officers known as directors.
The relationship between the SGA Senate and the SGA President resembles the relationship between a corporate board of directors and CEO: the Senate oversees, and may issue directives to, the SGA President.
Checks and balances do exist in the arrangement, however: the President may <a>veto</a> legislation coming out of the Senate, and the Senate may override a presidential veto with a 2/3 majority.
The judicial branch consists of a <a>student court</a> composed of a Chief Justice and four Associate Justices.
The Metro State Student Court concerns itself with matters of interpretation, <a>judicial review</a>, and conflict resolution.
It is composed of a Chairperson and four Commissioners appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the SGA Senate, and they also serve perpetual terms of office.
The current SGA Constitution was ratified by the student body in December 2004, and it has been amended a total of nine times (most recently, in April 2009).</p>
