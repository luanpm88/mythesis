established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History and geography</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|Metropolitan State College of Denver</a></p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Metro State is located in one of the older areas of Denver.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus is located at the former townsite of <a>Auraria</a>, which was founded in November 1858.
established$$$@@@%%%Denver was founded three weeks later on the opposing side (east side) of <a>Cherry Creek</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Denver would overtake Auraria, yet to the present day, there is still an Auraria neighborhood in Denver.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The boundaries of the neighborhood are <a>Colfax Avenue</a> on the south, the <a>South Platte River</a> on the northwest and Cherry Creek on the northeast.
mascot$$$@@@%%%The Auraria Campus now dominates this area.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Auraria had a mix of residential areas and industrial areas through the mid-20th century.
established$$$@@@%%%When the campus was built, many Aurarians, a majority of them Hispanic, were displaced and the school promised to serve the community.
established$$$@@@%%%The historic Tivoli Brewery was a beer brewery on this site that was preserved and the <a>&quot;Tivoli&quot;</a> now serves as a <a>Student Union</a> to all three schools on the campus; among other things it is noted for being the site of a stage of the now-defunct <a>Coors Classic</a> world-class bicycle race.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Two churches are still on the campus, St. Elizabeth's Church and <a>St.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%Cajetan</a>'s.
established$$$@@@%%%The Emmanuel Gallery, which is the oldest synagogue structure in Denver, is on the campus as well.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Metropolitan State College of Denver was founded in 1965 as an opportunity school.
established$$$@@@%%%The concept was that people from all walks of life could have a chance at a college education.
established$$$@@@%%%By design, Metro State is required to be accessible to all, which is why it consistently has some of the lowest tuitions of four-year Colorado <a>colleges</a> and <a>universities</a>.
faculty$$$@@@%%%The college also admits all students over the age of 20 that have a <a>GED</a> or high school diploma regardless of their prior academic record, according to the 2004&#x2013;2005 Metro State College Catalog.</p>
students$$$@@@%%%<p>The college mascot is the <a>Roadrunner</a>, which came into being because of the very nature of the campus.
established$$$@@@%%%Before becoming centralized on the downtown campus, Metro's classes were spread across Denver.
established$$$@@@%%%Students would only have fifteen minutes to go from class to class and would often run across busy streets in Denver, dodging traffic, to make it to class on time.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence students were referred to as roadrunners and a mascot was born.</p>

former_names$$$@@@%%%<h3>Department of Aviation and Aerospace Science</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Metro State has an extensive aviation-related facility known as the &quot;Seventh Street Building&quot; (due to its location on Seventh Street).
type$$$@@@%%%This facility contains the &quot;World Indoor Airport&quot;, an extensive array of flight <a>simulators</a> designed to train students in single-, multi- and <a>turboprop</a>-engine aircraft flight.
type$$$@@@%%%An ex-<a>United Airlines</a> <a>DC-10</a> non-moving simulator is also employed.
established$$$@@@%%%A project is under way to integrate <a>air traffic control</a> services and training into flight simulation training.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition, the Metro State Precision Flight Team is a member of NIFA (<a>National Intercollegiate Flying Association</a>) which is an association allowing university flight teams the opportunity to compete nationally in various flying categories of piloting.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The Metro State Flight Team traditionally does well against competitors, despite being handicapped by the fact that Metro State, unlike other college aviation programs, do not possess their own fleet of aircraft and must rent aircraft from various local flying clubs at the expense of the teams members.
nickname$$$@@@%%%NIFA consists of 80 college teams and only 3 of the colleges do not provide their teams with aircraft, Metro being one.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Regardless, these pilots are highly motivated and take pride in the team; not only do they dedicate many hours to the team by organizing and running fund raising events, attending practices every week, recruiting, and traveling to competitions but they also attend Metro and pay for addition training (Private, IFR, Comm, CFI ratings) required to graduate as Aviation Technology Majors.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Current majors offered at Metro State's aviation and aerospace department include professional pilot and aviation airport management studies.</p>

free$$$@@@%%%<h3>Metro State student government</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>student government</a> at Metro State operates under the name &quot;Student Government Assembly&quot; (more commonly referred to as &quot;SGA&quot;), and it is composed of legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
established$$$@@@%%%The legislative branch is called the SGA Senate, and it is composed of ten senators popularly elected each Spring semester to serve one-year terms of office that begin on June 1.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The executive branch includes the popularly-elected SGA President, Vice-President, Student Trustee, and two Representatives to a panel known as the Student Advisory Committee to the Auraria Board (&quot;SACAB&quot;).
established$$$@@@%%%These five officers form the core of a group called the Executive Committee, which also includes the Speaker of the Senate and five additional executive officers known as directors.
image_size$$$@@@%%%The President and Vice-President are elected jointly as a ticket, and each serves a one-year term of office that runs concurrently with the senators' terms of office; the Student Trustee and SACAB Representatives' terms of office (also one year in length) begin on July 1.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Directors are appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the Senate, and they serve at the pleasure of the President.
established$$$@@@%%%The relationship between the SGA Senate and the SGA President resembles the relationship between a corporate board of directors and CEO: the Senate oversees, and may issue directives to, the SGA President.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The President, in turn, is responsible for implementation and for regularly reporting to the Senate on the affairs of the student government.
established$$$@@@%%%Checks and balances do exist in the arrangement, however: the President may <a>veto</a> legislation coming out of the Senate, and the Senate may override a presidential veto with a 2/3 majority.
established$$$@@@%%%The judicial branch consists of a <a>student court</a> composed of a Chief Justice and four Associate Justices.
established$$$@@@%%%The Metro State Student Court concerns itself with matters of interpretation, <a>judicial review</a>, and conflict resolution.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Justices are appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the SGA Senate to serve perpetual terms (until they fall out of qualification or cease to be students at Metro State).
nickname$$$@@@%%%The SGA Election Commission is an autonomous panel responsible for administering student government elections.
established$$$@@@%%%It is composed of a Chairperson and four Commissioners appointed by the SGA President with the consent of the SGA Senate, and they also serve perpetual terms of office.
established$$$@@@%%%The current SGA Constitution was ratified by the student body in December 2004, and it has been amended a total of nine times (most recently, in April 2009).</p>
