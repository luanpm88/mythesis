<p>The <strong>University of Southern Maine</strong> (USM) is a multi-campus public urban comprehensive university and part of the <a>University of Maine System</a>.
Originally founded as two separate universities (Gorham Normal School, University of Maine at Portland), the two state universities were combined in 1970 to help streamline the public university system in Maine and eventually expanded by adding the Lewiston campus in 1988.
The Portland Campus is home to the <a>Edmund Muskie</a> School of Public Service along with the Bio Sciences Research Institute and the <a>University of Maine School of Law</a>, the <a>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute</a> and the Osher Map Library.
At Lewiston-Auburn, students experience a small, intimate campus, with a focus on interdisciplinary learning.
Each campus maintains its own &quot;atmosphere&quot;, and professionals from all campuses provide a world-class experience at this regional university.
<p>USM is among the &#x201c;Best Northeastern Colleges,&#x201d; according to The <a>Princeton Review</a>&#x2019;s 2007 listings, and was also included in its 2007 edition of &quot;America's Best Value Colleges.&quot;
The current president of USM is Dr. Selma Botman, who assumed the role on July&nbsp;1, 2008 after serving as the Chief Academic Officer for the <a>CUNY</a> system in New York.
Richard Pattenaude became chancellor of the <a>University of Maine System</a> on July&nbsp;1, 2007.</p>
<p>The mission statement of the university was amended by its Faculty Senate in November 2008, providing: :&quot;The University of Southern Maine, northern New England's outstanding public, regional, comprehensive university, is dedicated to providing students with a high quality, accessible, affordable education.
It supports sustainable development, environmental stewardship, and community involvement.
As a center for discovery, scholarship and creativity, USM provides resources for the state, the nation, and the world.&quot;</p>
