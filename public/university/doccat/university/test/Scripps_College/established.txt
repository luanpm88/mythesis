It is a member of the <a>Claremont Colleges</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Scripps was founded in 1926 by <a>Ellen Browning Scripps</a>, who believed that &quot;The paramount obligation of a college is to develop in its students the ability to think clearly and independently, and the ability to live confidently, courageously, and hopefully.&quot;
The motto of the college is &quot;Incipit Vita Nova&quot; (&quot;Here Begins New Life&quot;) from <a>Dante's</a> <em>New Life</em>.</p>

<p>The  campus, designed by the pioneering architect <a>Gordon Kaufmann</a> in the <a>Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture</a> he was known for, is on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
Scripps College is also known for its handsome landscaping designed by <a>Edward Huntsman-Trout</a>.
<p>In addition to the rigor of its academics, Scripps is noted for the beauty of its campus.
Fruit trees abound on the campus, and include orange (lining most paths near the residence halls), grapefruit (especially near the <a>Claremont McKenna College</a> campus), pomegranate (in the courtyards of Clark Hall and outside Dorsey Hall), kumquat (in Olive Court and outside the administration offices of Balch Hall), and loquat (in front of Toll Hall).
Scents of orange blossoms and wisteria perfume the campus in the early spring.
Elm Tree Lawn, located near Revelle House (once again the President's House, after containing the offices of the Alumnae Association for several years), has long been the site of Commencement ceremonies.</p>
Located in Seal Court near the mailroom and Malott Commons dining hall, the Motley is a socially- and environmentally-conscious business that provides students with a venue for events and concerts as well providing space to study, hang out, and drink <a>fair trade</a> espresso.
<p>Scripps College is also the home of the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery, which maintains Scripps College's permanent art collection of some 7500 objects spanning 3000 years of art history.
Among the holdings in the collection are works by American artists <a>Winslow Homer</a>, <a>Childe Hassam</a>, and <a>John James Audubon</a>, and an extensive collection of paintings by the California artist and Scripps Professor Emeritus <a>Millard Sheets</a>.</p>

The garden is laid out in two distinct sections: the western area contains the sculpture &quot;Eternal Primitive&quot;, a central pool and four walkways extending in the cardinal directions.
Arcades run along the north and south sides of the garden.</p>
The College commissioned Martinez in 1946 to paint a mural (entitled &quot;The Flower Vendors&quot; by Mart&#x00ed;nez) on the south wall of the Fowler garden.
Unexpectedly, he became ill and died on November 8, 1946 at the age of 72, leaving the mural unfinished.
<p>Scripps College has several sustainability initiatives underway, from energy conservation to green building practices.
On the conservation front, the college has seen monetary and energy savings through use of a new energy management system, and has designed water systems to cut down on waste.
Turning &quot;Alumnae Field&quot; into a natural surface also helped in efforts to conserve water.
<p>For its practices regarding sustainability, Scripps earned a D+ on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.
The college received positive recognition for their exploration of the possibility of investing in renewable energy, but fared particularly badly on evaluation categories of shareholder engagement and endowment transparency.</p>
Scripps College, <a>Claremont McKenna College</a>, <a>Pomona College</a>, <a>Pitzer College</a> and <a>Harvey Mudd College</a> not only interact socially, but also share dining halls, libraries, and other facilities spread throughout the bordering campuses.
<p>Scripps ranks 3rd in terms of the nation's top women's colleges, ahead of <a>Mount Holyoke</a> and <a>Bryn  Mawr College</a> at 23rd on the list for top liberal arts colleges in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2010.
General requirements include classes in fine arts, letters, natural sciences, social sciences, foreign language, women's/gender studies and race/ethnic studies.
<p>A key part of the Scripps experience is the Core curriculum, a sequence of three classes that encourage students to think critically and challenge ideas.
The concluding Core III classes encourage discussion and critical thinking for first-semester sophomores, culminating in individual projects.</p>
Among them, Scripps was named the &#x201c;Hottest Women&#x2019;s College&#x201d;.
Newsweek heralded Scripps&#x2019; academic strengths as well as its physical location and campus amenities.</p>
<li><strong><a>Eleanor Joy Toll Hall</a></strong> (&quot;Toll&quot;), 1927 - Toll Hall was the first building on campus and served not only as the student residence in the first few years of the College, but also housed the administration, faculty offices and classrooms.</li>
<li><strong><a>Ellen Browning Hall</a></strong> (&quot;Browning&quot;), 1929 - Named after the Founder of the College</li>
<li><strong><a>Mary Kimberly Hall</a></strong> (&quot;Kimberly&quot; or &quot;Kimbo&quot;), 1960, was built originally for female Harvey Mudd students and is thus architecturally different from all other halls.</li>
All of the residence halls have courtyards and fountains, as well as reading rooms, television rooms, kitchens, and living rooms.
Many of the rooms have balconies.</p>
<p>In 2006, <a>The Princeton Review</a> included Scripps in several of their rankings, such as &quot;Dorms Like Palaces&quot; (#4), &quot;Most Beautiful Campus&quot; (#17), and &quot;Best Campus Food&quot; (#19).
<li>Scripps has its own font (&quot;Goudy Scripps&quot; or &quot;Scripps College Old Style&quot;) and a printing press, as well as its own color (&quot;Scripps Green&quot;), a sage green that is used liberally across the campus, from doors in the residence halls, to the velvet seats in Boone Recital Hall, to the caps and gowns worn at Commencement.
The color was chosen to be reminiscent of the sagebrush originally covering the ground upon which the campus was built.
Goudy Scripps font is often seen in Denison Library, though is seldom used in college publications.</li>
<li>There are only two times a Scripps student may pass through the wooden front doors of Denison Library: during Matriculation, in which first-year students enter the doors and sign a handmade book, symbolically entering the college; and during Commencement, as graduating seniors exit the doors before the start of the Commencement ceremony.</li>
<li>In the late fifties and early sixties, following the founding of nearby Harvey Mudd College, first-year students were taken to the Mudd campus during orientation to sing to the incoming &quot;Mudders&quot;.
<li>Since the early days of the College, students have referred to one another as &quot;Scrippsies.&quot;
<li>Each graduating class may paint a section of Graffiti Wall, located in the Rose Garden.
