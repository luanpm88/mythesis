<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:RobertsonDavies.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robertson Davies]], the founding master of Massey College]] Massey College was conceived by <a>Vincent Massey</a>, the 18th <a>Governor General of Canada</a> who attended <a>University College</a> as an undergraduate.
Of the establishment of a new graduate college, Massey wrote, &quot;It is of great importance that it should, in its form, reflect the life which will go on inside it and should possess certain qualities&#x2014;dignity, grace, beauty, and warmth.&quot;
The <a>Massey Foundation</a>, for which Vincent Massey served as a trustee, provided the <a>financial endowment</a>.
<p>Opened in 1963, the college was designed by Canadian architect <a>Ron Thom</a>, who subsequently designed the master plan for <a>Trent University</a>.
<a>Alan Beddoe</a> designed the Massey College coats of arms.</p>
<p>The founding Master of Massey College (1963&#x2013;1981) was the celebrated Canadian journalist and author <a>Robertson Davies</a>, CC.
The fourth and current Master (1995&#x2013;  ) is the distinguished journalist <a>John Fraser</a>, CM.</p>
<p>Massey is home to an <a>ecumenical</a> worship space, St. Catherine's Chapel, the interior of which was originally designed by stage designer <a>Tanya Moiseiwitsch</a>.
The Chapel features an 18th-century Russian <a>iconostasis</a> and a baroque-style pipe organ.
The chapel was extensively redesigned in 2006 by the College architects, Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe and rededicated in June 2007.</p>
<p>During the 2006-2007 academic year, the College hosted the King and Queen of Sweden, held a special tribute in honour of its Founding Master, Robertson Davies, and was the host of the  <a>Man Booker International Prize</a> in April 2007.</p>
Each year, new prospective Junior Fellows apply to the college to be elected by the governing corporation.</p>
Journalism Fellows stay at the college for one academic year from September to May.
The college participates in the Canadian Journalism Fellowship Program (formerly known as the Southam Fellowship) and the Scholar-at-Risk program for international scholars caught in sectarian, political or religious intolerance.
Additionally, the college hosts a writer-in-residence chosen each year by the college and the University of Toronto's department of English.</p>
Senior fellows can serve as members of the governing corporation.
In addition, the chancellors of the <a>University of Cambridge</a> and the <a>University of Oxford</a> (currently <a>Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a> and <a>Lord Patten of Barnes</a>) both serve as Distinguished Honorary Fellows.
<p>As of 2010, notable Senior Fellows of the college include <a>John Polanyi</a>, <a>Ursula Franklin</a>, <a>Mikhail Baryshnikov</a>, <a>Margaret Atwood</a>,  Sir <a>Christopher Ondaatje</a>, <a>James Orbinski</a>, <a>Michael Valpy</a>, <a>Janice Stein</a>,  <a>Michael Bliss</a>, <a>Anthony Pawson</a>, Justice <a>Rosalie Abella</a> and <a>Bob Rae</a>.

<p><a>thumb|Exterior of the college</a> Massey College sponsors the annual <a>Massey Lectures</a> as well as the Walter Gordon Symposium on Public Policy.
In conjunction with the University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies, Massey fellows organise an annual symposium of interest to the broader community.
There is an annual newsletter to all its constituent members: Senior and Junior Fellows, alumni (which include former Senior Residents like <a>Preston Manning</a>), and  members of its Quadrangle Society (non-academic community members).</p>
<p>The college has a strong connection to the Canadian establishments and Canadian journalism.
The college also strives to preserve an <a>Oxbridge</a>-type atmosphere by mandating the wearing of gowns at dinner, and incorporating regular High Tables &mdash; complete with after-dinner snuff &mdash; into its schedule; and balances this with very active outreach programs .
The mandated goal of the college is to demonstrate through its corporate life the interconnectness between all learning.</p>
