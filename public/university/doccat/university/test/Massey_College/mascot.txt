Resident Junior Fellows generally live in the college for up to three years before becoming non-resident Junior Fellows for another two years.
The college also hosts visiting academics, generally on sabbatical leave, who are given the title of <em>Senior Residents</em>.
After long and meritorious service to the college, Senior Fellows may be elected as Continuing Senior Fellows, which are lifetime appointments.
