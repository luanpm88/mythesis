Middlebury is the first American institution of higher education to have granted a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating <a>Alexander Twilight</a> in the class of 1823.
Middlebury was also one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in <a>New England</a> to become a coeducational institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women.</p>
The Bread Loaf School of English is a summer graduate program in English literature, and the <a>Bread Loaf Writers' Conference</a> is one of the oldest writers' conferences in the country.
<p>The <a>Monterey Institute of International Studies</a> is a <em>Graduate School of Middlebury College</em>.
Middlebury is one of the &quot;<a>Little Ivies</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Middlebury received its founding charter on November 1, 1800, as an outgrowth of the <em>Addison County Grammar School</em>, which had been founded three years earlier in 1797.
The College's first president&#x2014;<a>Jeremiah Atwater</a>&#x2014;began classes a few days later, making Middlebury the first operating college or university in Vermont.
One student named Aaron Petty graduated at the first commencement held in August 1802.</p>
<p>The College's founding religious affiliation was loosely <a>Congregationalist</a>.
Yet the idea for a college was that of town fathers rather than clergymen, and Middlebury was clearly &quot;the Town's College&quot; rather than the Church's.
Chief among its founders were Seth Storrs and Gamaliel Painter, the former credited with the idea for a college  and the latter as its greatest early benefactor.
In addition to receiving a diploma upon graduation, Middlebury graduates also receive a replica of Gamaliel Painter's cane.
Painter bequeathed his original cane to the College and it is carried by the College President at official occasions including first-year convocation and graduation.</p>
<p><a>Alexander Twilight</a>, class of 1823, was the first black graduate of any college or university in the United States; he also became the first African American elected to public office, joining the <a>Vermont House of Representatives</a> in 1836.
<p>In 1883, the trustees voted to accept women as students in the college, making Middlebury one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution.
The first female graduate&#x2014;May Belle Chellis&#x2014;received her degree in 1886.</p>
<p>[[Image:KDRSign.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sign on Painter Hall commemorating the 1905 founding of national fraternity [[Kappa Delta Rho]]]] The national fraternity <a>Kappa Delta Rho</a> was founded in Painter Hall on May 17, 1905.
Middlebury College abolished fraternities in the early 1990s, but the organization continued on campus in the less ritualized form of a social house.
Due to a policy at the school against single-sex organizations, the house was forced to coeducate during the same period as well.</p>
<p>The German Language School, founded in 1915 under the supervision of then-President <a>John Martin Thomas</a>, began the tradition of the Middlebury Language Schools.
The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad, begun in 1949 with the school in Paris, host students at thirty-two sites in Argentina, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Paraguay, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and Uruguay.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|400px|Old Chapel with the Green Mountains in the distance</a> In May 2004, an anonymous benefactor made a $50 million donation to Middlebury.
It was the largest cash gift the school has ever received.
The donor asked only that Middlebury name its recently built science building, Bicentennial Hall, after outgoing President <a>John McCardell Jr</a>.
<p>In 2005, Middlebury signed an affiliation agreement with the <a>Monterey Institute of International Studies</a>, a <a>graduate school</a> in Monterey, California.
While the Monterey Institute initially remained a separate institution, the affiliation saved MIIS from financial difficulties.
It will allow Middlebury to offer additional programs in international studies and foreign languages.
On June 30, 2010, the Monterey Institute was officially designated as a &quot;graduate school of Middlebury College.&quot;</p>
<p>On October 6, 2007, President Ronald D. Liebowitz announced that the college is launching the Middlebury Initiative, a five-year campaign to raise $500 million.
The Initiative will extend and expand the range of opportunities available to students, focusing its efforts on financial aid and hiring more faculty.
It aims to make Middlebury the first truly global liberal arts college.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2008, the Board of Trustees approved renovations to the Proctor Dining Hall and the McCullough Student Center's social space, mail room, and convenience store.
This newest wave of renovations was completed in the spring of the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|375px|The spire of Mead Memorial Chapel, completed in 1916, rises on the highest elevation of the campus.
<p>Founded in 1800, the College enrolls approximately 2,350 undergraduates from all 50 states and 70 countries.
The College offers 40 undergraduate departments and programs.
Middlebury was the first institution of higher education in the United States to offer an <a>environmental studies</a> major, establishing the major in 1965.
Another 30 percent of students major in one of the College's interdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p>The academic year follows a 4&#x2013;1&#x2013;4 schedule of two four-course semesters plus a Winter Term session in January.
In 2009 the Language Schools opened a satellite location at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., for the teaching of languages in an immersion environment.
<p>All Language School students agree to abide by the Language Pledge, a formal commitment to speak, listen, read, and write the language of study as the only means of communication for the entire summer session.
The Pledge helps students to focus their energies on the acquisition of language skills and to internalize the patterns of communication and cultural perspective associated with the target language.
Each language school is allocated specific residence halls, where students, teaching assistants, and professors live to further aid in the immersion.
Students and faculty of specific languages eat lunch and dinner at separate times during the day to maintain the exclusivity of the target languages.</p>
<h4>The Monterey Institute of International Studies</h4>
<p>The <a>Monterey Institute of International Studies</a>, in <a>Monterey, California</a> became an affiliate of Middlebury following the signing of an affiliation agreement between the two in December 2005.
In Summer 2010, the Institute was formally designated as &#x201c;a graduate school of Middlebury College.&#x201d;
<p>The Institute is the only school in the Western Hemisphere offering graduate degrees in conference interpretation and in translation and interpretation between English-Chinese, English-Japanese and English-Korean.
English is required for non-native speakers and two years of university-level language classes in either <a>Spanish</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>German</a>, <a>Japanese</a>, <a>Chinese</a> (Mandarin), <a>Russian</a>, or <a>Arabic</a> for native English speakers.</p>
It is a flexible degree that encourages depth of research, but differs from the <a>Ph.D.</a> in the variety of subject matter studied as part of the doctoral <a>thesis</a>.</p>
<p>The Bread Loaf School of English is based at the college's <a>Bread Loaf Mountain</a> campus in Ripton, just outside Middlebury, in sight of the main ridge of the <a>Green Mountains</a>.
Frost &quot;first came to the School on the invitation of Dean <a>Wilfred Davison</a> in 1921.
Every summer since 1920, Bread Loaf has offered students from around the United States and the world intensive courses in literature, creative writing, the teaching of writing, and theater.
Prominent faculty and staff have included <a>George K. Anderson</a>, <a>William Carlos Williams</a>, <a>Herschel Brickell</a>, <a>Bernard DeVoto</a>, <a>Edward Weismiller</a>, <a>Theodore Roethke</a>, <a>John Crowe Ransom</a>, <a>Elizabeth Drew</a>, <a>A.
Bartlett Giamatti</a>, <a>Lawrence B. Holland</a>, <a>Nancy Martin</a>, <a>Perry Miller</a>, <a>Catherine Drinker Bowen</a>, <a>Carlos Baker</a>, <a>Harold Bloom</a>, <a>James Britton</a>, <a>Cleanth Brooks</a>, <a>Reuben Brower</a>, <a>Martin Price</a>, <a>Donald Stauffer</a>, <a>Charles Edward Eaton</a>, <a>Richard Ellman</a>, <a>Cedric Whitman</a>, <a>Paul Muldoon</a>, <a>William Sloane</a>, <a>John Ciardi</a>, <a>John P. Marquand</a>, <a>Wylie Sypher</a>, and Dixie Goswami.</p>
During the 2007&#x2013;2008 academic year, more than 400 Middlebury students studied abroad in more than 40 countries at more than 90 different programs and universities.
This accounts for nearly 60% of the junior class studying abroad.</p>
<p>The Rohatyn Center for International Affairs, was founded by <a>Felix Rohatyn</a> '49, investment banker, former <a>U.S. Ambassador to France</a>, and founder of Rohatyn Associates.
Located at the Robert A. Jones '59 House, the center combines Middlebury's strengths in political, linguistic, and cultural studies to offer internationally focused symposia, lectures, and presentations.
An internationally oriented resource and research center, the Rohatyn Center for International Affairs (RCFIA) supports the College's goal of advancing global understanding that radiates from a core linguistic and cultural competency.
<p>The Center for the Comparative Study of Race and Ethnicity, engages in interdisciplinary and comparative approaches for understanding formations of race and ethnicity and their effects on human relations.
It supports scholarship that considers race and ethnicity as intersecting with class, gender, sexuality, religion, age, disability, language, communication, migration and the environment.
Work supported by the Center situates these discussions in local, regional, global, and transnational contexts.
<p>In addition to the six-week summer program, Middlebury College's Bread Loaf campus is also the site of the <a>Bread Loaf Writers' Conference</a> for established authors, founded in <a>1926</a>.
It was called by <a>The New Yorker</a>, &quot;the oldest and most prestigious <a>writers' conference</a> in the country.&quot;
&quot;Two weeks of intensive workshops, lectures, classes and readings present writers with rigorous practical and theoretical approaches to their craft, and offer a model of literary instruction.&quot;</p>
<p>Noted authors who have been associated with the conference over the years include <a>James Brown</a>, <a>John Ciardi</a>, <a>Bernard DeVoto</a>, <a>Robert Frost</a>, <a>John Gardner</a>,  <a>Richard Gehman</a>,  <a>Donald Hall</a>, <a>John Irving</a>, <a>Shirley Jackson</a>, <a>Barry Lopez</a>, <a>Robie Macauley</a>, <a>Carson McCullers</a>, <a>Norman Mailer</a>, <a>Toni Morrison</a>, <a>Linda Pastan</a>, <a>May Sarton</a>, <a>Anne Sexton</a>, <a>Eudora Welty</a>, and <a>Richard Yates</a>.</p>
<p>Recent Fellows at the Conference have included <a>Christopher Castellani</a>, <a>Geri Doran</a>, <a>Thomas Sayers Ellis</a>, <a>Ilya Kaminsky</a>, <a>Suji Kwock Kim</a>, <a>Naeem Murr</a>, <a>Peter Orner</a>, <a>Eric Puchner</a>, <a>Richard Siken</a>, <a>Monique Truong</a>, <a>Vendela Vida</a>, and <a>C.
<p>In June 2010, Middlebury announced that it had a 40% stake in a joint-venture with <a>K12 Inc.</a> to build online language software.
The initial release will be of Spanish and French, level one, aimed at high school students.</p>
<p>Middlebury also offers summer language immersion programs in <a>Arabic</a>, <a>Chinese</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>German</a>, <a>Italian</a>, and <a>Spanish</a> to middle and high school students through the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy.
MMLA builds on the international expertise of both Middlebury College and the <a>Monterey Institute of International Studies</a> and adapts the Middlebury Language Schools immersion-based learning with a curriculum and activities developed specifically for students entering grades 7&#x2013;12.</p>
<p>The MMLA has sites at <a>Green Mountain College</a>, <a>Roger Williams University</a>, <a>Swarthmore College</a>, <a>Wofford College</a>, <a>Lewis University</a>, <a>Oberlin College</a>, <a>Pomona College</a>, and the <a>University of California-Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
For the class entering in 2010&#x2013;2011, there were a total of 7,984 applicants for the 580 September enrollment and 90 February enrollment spots.
A total of 1,529 students were admitted, resulting in an admit rate of about 19%.
For the class of 2014, the mid-50% range for the SAT I was 1970&#x2013;2200 and the mid-50% range for the ACT was 30&#x2013;33.</p>
<p>Middlebury is a <a>need-blind</a> institution, meaning it does not consider an applicant's financial situation when making an admission decision.
The college meets 100% of all admitted students' demonstrated financial need.
As a result of the financial crisis, Middlebury has altered its need-blind policy for international students.
Beginning with the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year, the College admits international students on a need-blind basis only to the extent that resources permit.
The College continues to meet the full demonstrated need of all admitted international students.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1994 the President and Board of Trustees of Middlebury College adopted a &#x201c;One Percent for Art&#x201d; policy.
With the adoption of this policy, which came within two years of the completion of the Center for the Arts and the Museum of Art, the Trustees formalized the existence of Committee on Art in Public Places (CAPP) and signaled that the arts would come to play an increasingly important role in Middlebury&#x2019;s institutional identity.</p>
The collection also includes works by <a>Tony Smith</a>, <a>Clement Meadmore</a>, <a>Jonathan Borofsky</a>, and <a>George Rickey</a>.</p>
<p>The 1,800 acre (7.3&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) <a>Bread Loaf Mountain</a> campus hosts the college's Bread Loaf School of English and the <a>Bread Loaf Writers' Conference</a> every summer.
The mountain campus is also the site of the <a>Middlebury College Snow Bowl</a>, the College-owned ski mountain, and the Carroll and Jane Rikert Ski Touring Center.</p>
<p>Middlebury also owns the <a>Robert Frost Farm</a>, where American poet <a>Robert Frost</a> lived and wrote in the summer and fall months from 1939 until his death in 1963.
newly renovated Hillcrest Environmental Center, a platinum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building]] Middlebury is committed to environmental sustainability and stewardship, both in its academic programs and in practice.
Middlebury recently incorporated environmental stewardship into its new mission statement.</pre>
<p>The college is a signatory to the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment and the <a>Talloires Declaration</a>.
Additionally, the college has committed to be carbon neutral by 2016.
Middlebury was one of only six universities to receive a grade of &#x201c;A-&#x201d; from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008, the highest grade awarded.</pre>
<p>In the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year, Middlebury College opened a new state-of-the-art <a>biomass</a> plant on campus that is estimated to cut the College's carbon dioxide output by 40 percent and reduce its use of fuel oil by 50 percent.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a>Rockefeller Brothers Fund</a> and Middlebury College announced the creation of the Sustainable Investments Initiative, a co-mingled fiscal vehicle seeking investments that generate long-term social, environmental, and economic value.
The Initiative will seek investments focused specifically on sustainability issues such as clean energy, water, climate science, and green building projects, in an effort to identify businesses positioned to become a part of the worldwide shift to improve energy efficiency, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate the effects of global climate change.</p>
<p>Also in 2010, Middlebury College and Integrated Energy Solutions, a Vermont developer of farm-based methane energy, agreed to explore a bio-methane gas collection and delivery system that could help Middlebury further reduce its use of fossil fuels.
Middlebury has agreed to purchase bio-methane gas from IES over a 10-year period, with the agreement contingent on the college raising money to build storage facilities for the gas on campus and retrofit its current heating plant to burn the new fuel.</p>
<p> The <a>New England Review</a> (<em>NER</em>) is a quarterly literary journal published by Middlebury College.
Founded in New Hampshire in 1978 by poet, novelist, editor and professor <a>Sydney Lea</a> and poet <a>Jay Parini</a>, it was published as <em>New England Review &amp; Bread Loaf Quarterly</em> from 1982 (when it moved to Middlebury College), until 1991 as a formal division of the <a>Bread Loaf Writers' Conference</a>.
In 1991, the magazine reverted to its original name, <em>New England Review</em>, and opted to have only informal ties with the Writers' Conference.</p>
