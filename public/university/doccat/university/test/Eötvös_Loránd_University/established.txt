<p>The <strong>E&#x00f6;tv&#x00f6;s Lor&#x00e1;nd University</strong> or <strong>ELTE</strong>, founded in 1635, is the largest university in <a>Hungary</a>, located in <a>Budapest</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded in 1635 in Nagyszombat (today <a>Trnava</a>, Slovakia) by the archbishop and theologian <a>P&#x00e9;ter P&#x00e1;zm&#x00e1;ny</a>. Leadership was given over to the <a>Jesuit</a>s.
The College of Law was added in 1667 and the College of Medicine was started in 1769.
After the dissolution of the Jesuit order, the university was moved to <a>Buda</a> (a part of Budapest today) in 1777 in accordance with the intention of the founder.
The university received its final location in <a>Pest</a> (the other side of today's Budapest) in 1784.
The language of education was <a>Latin</a> until 1844, when Hungarian was introduced as an official language.
<p>It was named <strong>University of Budapest</strong> (<em>Budapesti Tudom&#x00e1;nyegyetem</em>) until 1921, when it was renamed <strong>P&#x00e1;zm&#x00e1;ny P&#x00e9;ter University</strong> (not to be confused with <a>P&#x00e1;zm&#x00e1;ny P&#x00e9;ter Katolikus Egyetem</a>, a separate and more recent university).
The Faculty of Science started its separate life in 1949.
The university received its current name <em>E&#x00f6;tv&#x00f6;s Lor&#x00e1;nd University</em> after the physicist <a>Lor&#x00e1;nd E&#x00f6;tv&#x00f6;s</a> in 1950.</p>
According to the <em><a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a></em> by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> (2010), it was qualified as the best university in Hungary (301-400th in the complete list), with the <a>University of Szeged</a>.</p>
