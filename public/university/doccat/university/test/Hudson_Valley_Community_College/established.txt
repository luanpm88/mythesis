<h2>History</h2>
<p>Growing out of the Veteran&#x2019;s Vocational School in downtown Troy, New York, the college was founded in 1953 as the Hudson Valley Technical Institute.
Initially, the role of the college was to provide practical hands-on vocational training for veterans returning from World War II.
Dwight Marvin, editor of the Troy Record, was one of several community leaders who pressed to create a broader mission for the college, which in 1959 would be officially known as Hudson Valley Community College.
<p>The college initially was housed in the former Earl and Williams shirt collar factory building at Broadway and Seventh Avenue, but by 1955, the board of trustees was already looking for a larger location to site a campus.
The trustees surveyed likely sites for a new campus and in 1956 announced that the Williams farm, which straddled the Troy-North Greenbush border, would be the chosen site.
<p>The new campus was initially opposed by a group of Rensselaer County taxpayers, who argued that the county should not have to pay for half the cost of the campus construction if fewer than half the students were county residents.
What would became a landmark case for community colleges in New York State eventually was heard by the state&#x2019;s Court of Appeals.
On June 25, 1958, the court upheld the county&#x2019;s right to fund half of the cost of construction and paved the way for capital construction at community colleges around the state.
The new campus, with five Indiana limestone buildings, was completed in 1961 and the former factory building was abandoned and eventually torn down.</p>
<p><strong>Otto V. Guenther, 1953 - 1965</strong>  Otto Guenther was selected in 1953 to be the first president of the newly established Hudson Valley Technical Institute.
In 1957, President Guenther received approval from the Rensselaer County Board of Supervisors to begin construction of a new campus on the border of Troy and the town of North Greenbush.
That transition to a newly created suburban campus and the growth of the student body were Guenther&#x2019;s legacy as president.</p>
<p><strong>James J. Fitzgibbons, 1965 - 1979</strong>  James Fitzgibbons presided over impressive growth in the college&#x2019;s student body and in the number of academic programs offered.
During his tenure, Hudson Valley&#x2019;s curricula grew from 18 to 38 academic programs.
The Fitzgibbons Health Technologies Center was dedicated to the president in 1982.
<p><strong>Joseph J. Bulmer, 1979 - 1996</strong> The longest-tenured president of the college, Joseph J. Bulmer served Hudson Valley for 17 years.
A nuclear engineer with a distinguished career at General Electric, Dr. Bulmer was responsible for increasing the college&#x2019;s image in the Capital Region.
<p><strong>Stephen M. Curtis, 1996 - 1998</strong> Dr. Stephen Curtis came to Hudson Valley Community College after serving as interim president of Borough of Manhattan Community College.
While at Hudson Valley, Dr. Curtis led improvements to the college&#x2019;s distance learning program and helped link the college to several high schools around the region through interactive television.
<p><strong><a>John L. Buono</a>, 1998 - 2003</strong> The only alumnus to serve as president of Hudson Valley Community College, John Buono had a lengthy career in public service before accepting the offer to serve as interim president of his alma mater.
Buono served as <a>Rensselaer County</a> Executive from 1986 to 1995 and was then tapped by Governor George Pataki to head the New York State Dormitory Authority, where he served as director for three years.
Buono&#x2019;s tenure as president of the college saw the creation of the Viking Child Care Center, Guenther Enrollment Services Center and the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.
He also established the college&#x2019;s Workforce Development Institute, which provides non-credit, customized training for business and industry.
During Dr. Silvestri&#x2019;s tenure, the college received reaffirmation of its accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities.
Prior to arriving at Hudson Valley, he served as president of Northwest Iowa Community College in Sheldon, Iowa, for three years.
