established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Growing out of the Veteran&#x2019;s Vocational School in downtown Troy, New York, the college was founded in 1953 as the Hudson Valley Technical Institute.
established$$$@@@%%%Initially, the role of the college was to provide practical hands-on vocational training for veterans returning from World War II.
established$$$@@@%%%Dwight Marvin, editor of the Troy Record, was one of several community leaders who pressed to create a broader mission for the college, which in 1959 would be officially known as Hudson Valley Community College.
head_label$$$@@@%%%Marvin served as the first chairman of the college&#x2019;s Board of Trustees.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college initially was housed in the former Earl and Williams shirt collar factory building at Broadway and Seventh Avenue, but by 1955, the board of trustees was already looking for a larger location to site a campus.
