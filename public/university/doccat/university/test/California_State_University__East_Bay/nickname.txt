ASI currently has four departments: ASI Presents, ASI Business Office, Student Government, and the Early Childhood Education Center.
In 2008, the administration again did not allow ASI to hold a referendum on increasing student fees to fund athletic scholarship for a move to Division II sports.
At the inception of the athletic program in 1961 the student body chose a spacesuit clad Space Pioneer as the mascot.
In the 1980s the student body voted to change the mascot to the Vampires, but the decision was overturned by then-president Ellis McCune.
However, there was little student support for a mascot change; a majority of the students and faculty were in favor of keeping the Pioneer as the school mascot while supporting a redesign of the Pioneer image.
A final decision on whether or not to keep the Pioneer as the mascot of the university was to be reached before the 2006-2007 academic year but is still an open question in 2010.
The University is currently a &quot;scheduling partner&quot; in the <a>California Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (CCAA), competing against Division II teams across the state.
