nickname$$$@@@%%%At the inception of the athletic program in 1961 the student body chose a spacesuit clad Space Pioneer as the mascot.
established$$$@@@%%%In the years since the mascot was shortened to the Pioneers and took a more terrestrial image; first as a frontiersman with a coonskin cap and then as a forty-niner who is reminiscent of <a>Yosemite Sam</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%In the 1980s the student body voted to change the mascot to the Vampires, but the decision was overturned by then-president Ellis McCune.
former_names$$$@@@%%%In 2005 there was talk of changing the mascot along with the university's name change.
established$$$@@@%%%The original plan was to unveil the new mascot by the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%However, there was little student support for a mascot change; a majority of the students and faculty were in favor of keeping the Pioneer as the school mascot while supporting a redesign of the Pioneer image.
nickname$$$@@@%%%A final decision on whether or not to keep the Pioneer as the mascot of the university was to be reached before the 2006-2007 academic year but is still an open question in 2010.
