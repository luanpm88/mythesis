<p><strong>California State University, East Bay</strong> (informally referred to as <strong>Cal State East Bay</strong>, <strong>CSU East Bay</strong>, <strong>East Bay</strong>, and <strong>CSUEB</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> located in the <a>eastern region</a> of the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.
The university, as part of the 23-campus <a>California State University</a> system, offers over 100 areas of study.
Cal State East Bay has been designated as a &quot;top&#x2013;tier&quot; institution among master's&#x2013;granting universities in the west by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> and has been recognized as a &quot;Best in the West&quot; college for the past seven years by the <a>Princeton Review</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1957, Cal State East Bay has a student body of over 13,000.
The university's largest and oldest campus is located in the <a>Hayward Hills</a>, with additional campus-sites in the cities of <a>Oakland</a> and <a>Concord</a>.
Cal State East Bay is one of only a handful of universities in the California State University system to operate on the <a>quarter system</a>.</p>
<p>With multiple campuses across the region, the university adopted a new, broader mission to serve the eastern San Francisco Bay Area in 2005.
To reflect the university's more widespread objective, the school changed its name from California State University, Hayward to California State University, East Bay that same year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was established in 1957 as State College for Alameda County, with its primary mission to serve the higher education needs of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.
Its construction was part of the <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> as proposed by <a>Clark Kerr</a> and the original site for the school was <a>Pleasanton, California</a>.
The campus was moved to Hayward before plans were finalized due to the efforts of State Assembly member Carlos Bee and other boosters from the Hayward community.
At the time of its opening in 1959, classes were held on the campus of <a>Hayward High School</a>.
With the addition of the school, higher education in the San Francisco Bay Area became more accessible.
To the south was San Jose State College (now <a>San Jose State University</a>) serving the South Bay counties.
To the west was San Francisco State College (now <a>San Francisco State University</a>) serving San Francisco and San Mateo Counties.
<a>Chabot College</a>, a part of the <a>California Community College</a> system, opened nearby in Hayward in 1961.</p>
<p>The university has undergone numerous transitions in its history, making name changes accordingly.
In 1961, the school was moved to its present location in the Hayward Hills and renamed Alameda County State College.
The school was granted university status in 1972, changing its name to California State University, Hayward.
In 2005, the university implemented a new, broader mission to serve the eastern San Francisco Bay Area and adopted the name California State University, East Bay.
The proposal to rename the campus to California State University, East Bay  was approved by the California State University Board of Trustees on January 26, 2005.</p>
Warren Hall, its signature building on top of the Hayward hills, overlooks the scenic eastern portion of the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.
The building is visible from cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, serving as a landmark for Hayward and the surrounding Eastern San Francisco Bay Area.
Since its completion in 2004 the university has received recognition on a regional and national level for the project; those include:</p>
<li>A 2005 Exceptional Project Award from the Western Council of Construction Consumers.</li>
<p>On April 8, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a fuel cell project of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) allowing Cal State East Bay&#x2019;s Hayward campus to become one of the first college campuses in Northern California to have a fuel cell.
<p>Since 2004, the <a>Pioneer Amphitheatre</a> on campus has been home of the <a>KBLX</a> Stone Soul Picnic, a day long festival of <a>R&amp;B</a>, <a>soul</a> and <a>Urban Adult Contemporary</a> music, featured performers have included <a>Ronald Isley</a>, <a>The Whispers</a>, <a>Teena Marie</a>, the late <a>Rick James</a>, and <a>The O'Jays</a>.
<p>In 2005, Cal State East Bay launched an aggressive construction project with the building of three new facilities: the Wayne and Gladys Valley Business and Technology Center (VBT), the Pioneer Heights student housing expansion and the University Union annex.
The  VBT center was dedicated on February 28, 2007, making it the first new academic building on the Hayward Campus in more than 30 years.
An expansion to Pioneer Heights was dedicated in fall 2008.
Student housing was able to accommodate more than 450 new residents and offer a  dining commons.
An annex to the existing University  Union opened in January 2007.
<p>Construction workers removed the stadium&#x2019;s grass and replaced it with artificial turf, while widening the field to regulation size, said Jim Zavagno, director of planning design and construction for Cal State East Bay.</p>
<p>As part of the facility&#x2019;s overall renovation, which began in January, the width of the existing running track circling the playing field was narrowed to five lanes to accommodate the larger field.
&#x201c;In addition to the competition areas, improved sidewalks and fencing were added to the facility,&#x201d; said Zavagno, who reported that the construction costs came in under budget at $1.9 million, about $600,000 less than had originally been projected.
<p>Beginning in September, a parking structure is to be built that will add 1,100 additional parking spaces.
The project with a cost of $24.5 million, will be paid by the parking fees.
<p>On May 17, 2006 <a>Mohammad Qayoumi</a> succeeded Norma S. Rees as president of the university.
<p>The university is best known for its College of Business and Economics; a strong Education Department, where a large percentage of California teachers receive their certification; and the thriving Music Department where the California State University, East Bay Jazz Ensemble, directed by <a>Dave Eshelman</a>(retired June 2007), holds annual performances in <a>Yoshi's</a> at <a>Jack London Square</a> in Oakland and frequently tours <a>Europe</a> and parts of <a>South America</a>.
The Biotechnology Program developed at California State University, East Bay affords the university a status as the center of research and development in the <a>Life sciences</a>, <a>Bioinformatics</a> and <a>technologies</a> for the <a>Eastern San Francisco Bay Area</a>.</p>
<p>California State University, East Bay also participates in the <a>Internet2</a> project, a collaboration led by over 200 U.S. universities, private industries, and governments to develop advanced network technologies for research and higher education in the 21st century.</p>
<p>California State University, East Bay offers 52 undergraduate degree programs and 39 Masters degree programs in addition to its teacher education program.
The university also has a doctoral program in Educational Leadership (Ed.
D.) held in cooperation with the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, <a>San Francisco State University</a> and <a>San Jos&#x00e9; State University</a>.
<p>A 2010 report on the California State University system&#x2019;s statewide economic impact reveals that California State University, East Bay contributes $415 million annually to the regional economy: a return of more than $5 for every state dollar invested.
The report, &#x201c;Working for California: The Impact of the California State University System,&#x201d; also underscores the long-lasting value of a Cal State East Bay education, concluding that approximately $1.6 billion of earnings by alumni in the East Bay area is directly attributable to their college degrees and creates an additional $2.5 billion of industry activity throughout the state.</p>
<p>The university's Department of Communications publishes a weekly newspaper called <em>The Pioneer</em>, its name referring to the school <a>mascot</a>, Pioneer Pete.
The paper is staffed by faculty and students.
East Bay is a diverse state university as indicated by the annual headcount report.
Elected by the California State University, East Bay student body, the 15-member ASI Board of Directors is the governing body of Associated Students, Inc.
The Board makes policy and oversees the fiscal responsibility of ASI.
Additionally, the Board assists the University in planning, implementing, and evaluating campus programs, events, and curriculum.
In the years since the mascot was shortened to the Pioneers and took a more terrestrial image; first as a frontiersman with a coonskin cap and then as a forty-niner who is reminiscent of <a>Yosemite Sam</a>.
The original plan was to unveil the new mascot by the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.
A new athletics logo was unveiled on November 20, 2009 at a home opener basketball game.</p>
