<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|150px|left|Keimyung University</a> Keimyung University originated from Keimyung Christian College, which was founded in March 1954, by Reverend Edward Adams, an American missionary of the Northern Presbyterian Church of the U.S., and by Reverends Choi Jaehwa and Kang Ingu, two local Presbyterian Church leaders.
The founding principle guiding their concerted efforts was to provide Koreans with higher education firmly anchored in Christianity.
The opening of the university also reflected the perceived need for higher education as a vehicle with which to reconstruct the war-ravaged nation and a means of perpetuating the time-honored spirit of the Korean people.
1978, the year of Keimyung's elevation to the status of a university, marked the beginning of a new period of rapid development.
In October 1980, the university merged with the Dongsan Presbyterian Hospital, a prestigious local hospital with 81-year history of service, and re-opened it as Keimyung University Medical Center.
The development of Keimyung acquired a new dimension in the early 1980s when it added a new campus built on 550,000 pyeong (181,500 sq.
Offering an academic atmosphere which fosters genuine learning and nourishment of intellectual pursuits, Keimyung is to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2004.
When its ambitious plan for Seongseo Campus is brought to a fruition, Keimyung will be able to enjoy its second takeoff.</p>

<p><a>thumb|300px|right|Dongsan Library, Keimyung University</a> <a>The Dongsan Library</a>, originally known as the Library of Keimyung Christian College, was established in July 1958.
It was moved to its current site at the Seong Seo Campus in March 1993 to facilitate expansion into a much larger facility that meets the needs of the information age.
Equipped with sophisticated multi-media functions and an advanced information retrieval network, the Dongsan Library is now the focal point for research activities of faculty members as well as students.
It will also contribute greatly to the development of the community by offering useful information to local residents.</p>
<p>Keimyung University Medical Center consists of a medical school rated as one of the best institutes of medical education in Korea,a nursing school with 100%passing on national examination and employment of the graduates, Dongsan hospital, and Gyeongju Dongsan hospital.
The History of Dongsan Medical Center dates back to 1899 when Dr. Woodbridge O. Johnson, an American Missionary dispatched by the Korean Mission of the Northern Presbyterian Church of the United States, started the Salvation Hospital and became the founder of the medical center.
It was the beginning of the first medical activity in Daegu.
<p><a>thumb|300px|right|Museum, Keimyung University</a> Since it was established on May 20, 1978, the Museum has devoted its efforts to studying the historical and cultural heritage of the local region with a special focus on Kaya, an ancient civilization that once flourished in Korea, but which left few records.
Since then, the museum has accomplished much, including the excavation of the royal tombs of the Kaya Dynasty.Many Kaya artifacts uncovered through those efforts are on display in the Museum.
Currently, a plan is under way to construct a new museum on a 9,900 square-meter site with a total floor space of 5,940 square meters.
The opening is scheduled for May 2004, which will also mark the 50th anniversary of the university.
