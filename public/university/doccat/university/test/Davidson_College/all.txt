established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 1850s, Davidson overcame financial difficulty by instituting &quot;The Scholarship Plan,&quot; a program that allowed Davidson hopefuls to purchase a scholarship for $100, which could be redeemed in exchange for full tuition to Davidson until the 1870s.
established$$$@@@%%%The college's financial situation improved dramatically in 1856 with a $250,000 donation by Maxwell Chambers, making Davidson the wealthiest college south of Princeton.
established$$$@@@%%%The Chambers Building was built to commemorate this gift.
established$$$@@@%%%On November 28, 1921, the Chambers Building was destroyed in a fire but was rebuilt 8 years later with funds provided by a generous gift from the Rockefeller family.
established$$$@@@%%%The Chambers Building continues to be the primary academic building on campus.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1923, the Gamma chapter in North Carolina of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Davidson.
established$$$@@@%%%Over 1500 men and 500 women have been initiated into Davidson's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1924, James Duke formed the Duke Endowment, which has provided millions of dollars to the college, including a $15 million dollar pledge in 2007 to assist with the elimination of student loans.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On May 5, 1972 the trustees voted to allow women to enroll at Davidson as degree students for the first time.
established$$$@@@%%%(Women had attended classes as early as the 1860s but did not enjoy degree privileges.
established$$$@@@%%%The first women to attend classes at Davidson were then-President Kirkpatrick's five daughters, who attended classes to increase the size of the student body during the Civil War.)  Art major Marianna &quot;Missy&quot; Woodward &#x2018;73, the only woman in a class of 217, was the first woman to graduate from Davidson.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In early 2005, the College's Board of Trustees voted in a 31-5 decision to allow 20% of the board to be non-Christian.
established$$$@@@%%%<a>John Belk</a>, the former mayor of <a>Charlotte</a> and one of the heirs of <a>Belk Department Store</a>, was a casualty of this decision, resigning in protest after more than six decades of affiliation with the college.
