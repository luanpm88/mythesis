The college has graduated 23 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> and is consistently ranked in the top ten liberal arts colleges in the country by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> magazine.</p>
<p>Both the town and college were named after Brigadier General <a>William Lee Davidson</a>, a Revolutionary War commander.
The land for the college came from General Davidson's estate, a large portion of which was donated by his son.
The college was established by <a>Presbyterians</a> in 1837 and maintains a loose affiliation with that denomination.
According to its Statement of Purpose, &quot;the ties that bind the college to its Presbyterian heritage . . .
<em><a>Newsweek</a></em> named Davidson as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies.&quot;
On 19 March 2007, Davidson became the first liberal arts college in the country to eliminate the need for loans in financial aid packages.
<p>The school became co-educational in 1973 and today maintains a 50/50 ratio of men to women.
A high percentage of Davidson graduates enter the legal profession, medicine, or government service.</p>

<p>The Davidson College Office of Admission &amp; Financial Aid presents the college as one &quot;dedicated to intellectual and cultural growth in the broadest sense.&quot;
The selection process is composed of three major elements: 1) the evaluation of academic performance and potential; 2) the assessment of individual characteristics; and 3) the recognition of outstanding interests, achievements, and activities.
<p>Davidson offers majors in 20 subject areas, which include Anthropology, Art, Biology, Chemistry, Classics, Economics, English, French, German, History, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Religion, Sociology, Spanish, and Theater.
<p>In February 2002, the Royal Shakespeare Company opened the Duke Family Performance Hall, one of the premier performance spaces in the Southeast.
Begun by Professor George Labban in the 1960s, the program has survived the retirement of Labban and his successor Dirk French.
Presently, it is the most popular of the college&#x2019;s study abroad programs, along with the Semester in India program.
The Wildcats participate as a member of the <a>Southern Conference</a> in most sports.
Their last tournament victory was in <a>2008</a> over <a>Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball</a> in the third round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament.
The Wildcats' NCAA Tournament run came after finishing their regular season undefeated in conference play, at 20&ndash;0, and as the champions of the <a>Southern Conference Tournament</a>.
<p>Under the guidance of Coach <a>Bob McKillop</a>, the Wildcats have consistently posted winning seasons.
<a>Matt Doherty</a>, current head coach at <a>SMU</a> and former head coach of <a>Notre Dame</a>, <a>North Carolina</a> and <a>Florida Atlantic</a>, experienced his first coaching job as an assistant under McKillop, who, not coincidentally, was Doherty's high school coach on Long Island.
Former <a>Virginia</a> head coach and current <a>East Carolina</a> <a>athletic director</a> <a>Terry Holland</a> is a Davidson graduate (Class of 1964) and was Driesell's first recruit at Davidson, before advancing to assistant coaching, head coaching and athletic director duties at Davidson.
<a>Larry Brown</a>, who would go on to win an NCAA championship with Kansas in 1988 and NBA championship with Detroit in 2004, began his nomadic head coaching career at Davidson, managing to depart before the start of his first season.
<a>Jim Larranaga</a>, who took <a>George Mason</a> to the <a>2006 Final Four</a>, is a former Davidson assistant coach.
<a>Rick Barnes</a> of <a>Texas</a> was also a Davidson assistant.</p>
<p>The peak of the soccer program was in 1992 when the team made a run to the NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament Final Four.
Led by two-time All-American <a>Rob Ukrop</a>, Davidson finished the regular season 17&ndash;5&ndash;5, earning an at-large invitation to the NCAA Tournament.
Three electrifying wins &#x2014; two on penalty kicks and one in sudden death overtime &#x2014; propelled Davidson into the Final Four, which miraculously was being hosted by Davidson on the school's campus.
Head coach <a>Charlie Slagle</a> was awarded NCAA Division I Coach of the Year for men's soccer.
Remarkably, all of this was accomplished without the use of a single athletic scholarship on the 1992 team, leading the <em><a>New York Times</a></em> to herald the team as &#x201c;22 educated feet.&#x201d;</p>
The <em>Davidsonian</em> was founded in 1914 and has published a volume every year since then.
<p>Davidson is also known for its three <a>a cappella</a> groups: the Generals, the Delilahs, and Androgyny.
<p><a>The Davidson Generals</a>, an all-male group, took first place in the &quot;Rockin' the Forest&quot; intercollegiate a cappella competition at <a>Wake Forest University</a> in 2005.
<p><a>The Davidson Delilahs</a>, an all-female group, have produced four albums to date: &quot;Falling into Place&quot; (2001); &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (2004); &quot;Kickin' Off our Heels&quot; (2006); and a brand new self-titled album &quot;Davidson Delilahs&quot; (2008).
The Delilahs also frequently host other a cappella groups from across the country, including, most recently, the <a>Haverford S-Chords</a>.</p>
<p><a>Davidson Androgyny</a> was founded in 1998 as a response to the absence of a co-ed a cappella group on campus.
Androgyny has released two albums, &quot;Everything But The Piano&quot; (2001) and &quot;The A Capocalypse&quot; (2003), and released its most recent album, &quot;A Class Act,&quot; in Fall of 2008.
The group also sang &quot;I'm Yours&quot; with platinum recording artist <a>Jason Mraz</a> on his &quot;Music, Magic, and Make Peace Tour&quot; stop at Davidson College on April 19, 2008.</p>
<p>The fraternity and eating house system at Davidson is known as Patterson Court and is governed by the Patterson Court Council.
<p>Additionally, <a>Kappa Alpha Psi</a>, <a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a>, and <a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> maintain a presence on campus.
The <a>NPHC</a> sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha is the newest member of Davidson College's social community, receiving its charter in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a>Royal Shakespeare Company</a> performed <a>William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a>The Merchant of Venice</a></em> in residency at Davidson College, the RSC's second residency at a US college or university.
The performance inaugurated the Duke Family Performance Hall.
In March 2005, the RSC returned to Davidson and was in residency for most of the month, performing <em><a>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></em> and <em><a>Julius Caesar</a></em> by <a>William Shakespeare</a>, as well as numerous educational activities, many of which were open to the general public.
The productions <em>Infinite Variety</em> and <em>For Every Passion Something</em> were presented at the <a>Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a> in <a>Edinburgh</a>, <a>Scotland</a>.
In February 2007, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed Shakespeare's <em><a>Pericles</a></em> and <em><a>The Winter's Tale</a></em>, as well as <a>Roy Williams</a>'s <a>Days of Significance</a>, in the Duke Family Performance Hall.
<p>On 19 March 2007, Davidson College announced that all students would have their demonstrated financial need met by grants and student employment; loans would no longer be a component of any Davidson financial aid package.
On 7 June 2007, the <a>Duke Endowment</a> pledged $15,000,000 to support the initiative.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Davidson College was founded in 1837 by The Concord Presbytery after purchasing  of land from William Lee Davidson II.
The first students graduated from Davidson in 1840 and received diplomas with the newly created college seal designed by Peter Stuart Ney, who is believed by some to be Napoleon's <a>Marshal Ney</a>.
<p>In the 1850s, Davidson overcame financial difficulty by instituting &quot;The Scholarship Plan,&quot; a program that allowed Davidson hopefuls to purchase a scholarship for $100, which could be redeemed in exchange for full tuition to Davidson until the 1870s.
The college's financial situation improved dramatically in 1856 with a $250,000 donation by Maxwell Chambers, making Davidson the wealthiest college south of Princeton.
The Chambers Building was built to commemorate this gift.
On November 28, 1921, the Chambers Building was destroyed in a fire but was rebuilt 8 years later with funds provided by a generous gift from the Rockefeller family.
The Chambers Building continues to be the primary academic building on campus.</p>
<p>In 1923, the Gamma chapter in North Carolina of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Davidson.
Over 1500 men and 500 women have been initiated into Davidson's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>In 1924, James Duke formed the Duke Endowment, which has provided millions of dollars to the college, including a $15 million dollar pledge in 2007 to assist with the elimination of student loans.</p>
<p>On May 5, 1972 the trustees voted to allow women to enroll at Davidson as degree students for the first time.
(Women had attended classes as early as the 1860s but did not enjoy degree privileges.
The first women to attend classes at Davidson were then-President Kirkpatrick's five daughters, who attended classes to increase the size of the student body during the Civil War.)  Art major Marianna &quot;Missy&quot; Woodward &#x2018;73, the only woman in a class of 217, was the first woman to graduate from Davidson.</p>
<p>In early 2005, the College's Board of Trustees voted in a 31-5 decision to allow 20% of the board to be non-Christian.
<a>John Belk</a>, the former mayor of <a>Charlotte</a> and one of the heirs of <a>Belk Department Store</a>, was a casualty of this decision, resigning in protest after more than six decades of affiliation with the college.
Belk, however, continued his strong relationship with his alma mater and was honored in March 2006 at the Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the Belk Scholarship.</p>
<li>John Rennie Blake (1871&#x2013;1877) - served as Chief Administrative Official for 6 years after President McPhail died in 1871, during which period there was no official president of the college</li>
<li>Henry Louis Smith (1901&#x2013;1912) - Henry Smith and his students at Davidson are credited with producing one of the first (if not the first) X-ray photographs in the United States on January 12 and 13 1896</li>
