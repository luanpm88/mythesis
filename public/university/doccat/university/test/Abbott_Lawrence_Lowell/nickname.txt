He demonstrated outspoken support for academic freedom during World War I and played a prominent role in urging the public to support American participation in the League of Nations following the war.</p>
<p>From relatively early in his professional career, Lowell worried about the role of racial and ethnic minorities in American society.
Lowell dismantled the elective system and in its place established concentration (what is commonly call a &quot;major&quot;) and distribution requirements that would soon become the new American model.
Student living arrangements embodied and intensified the problem.
In 1920, Harvard purchased the private dormitories on Mt.
Typical were &quot;The War of 1812,&quot; &quot;The Development of Choral Music,&quot; &quot;The Migration of Birds,&quot; and &quot;American Orators and Oratory.&quot;
<p>When the schoolteachers asked why they were not entitled to the same bachelors degree as the Harvard College students, Lowell defended the distinction.
Harvard responded with a new Adjunct in Arts.</p>
Writing in private in 1916, Brandeis described men like Lowell &quot;who have been blinded by privilege, who have no evil purpose, and many of whom have a distinct public spirit, but whose environment&mdash;or innate narrowness&mdash;have obscured all vision and sympathy with the masses.&quot;</p>
Lowell and the League to Enforce Peace tried to hold the middle ground.
He cared little about Wilson&#x2019;s specific plan or the details of the reservations or amendments Lodge wanted to attach for the Senate to give its assent.
I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.</p>
If the League lost a referendum in that way, there would be no hope for its revival under the new administration.</p>
Lowell proved particularly opposed to readmission for those who had been expelled only for associating too closely with those more directly involved.
<p> African-American students had lived in Harvard&#x2019;s dormitories for decades, until Lowell changed the policy.
Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus and the father of an incoming freshman: &quot;We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together.&quot;
We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.&quot;
Some black freshmen lived in the dormitories but believed that not all the Freshman Halls were open to them.
He also suggested that Harvard would not be facing this issue if other universities and colleges would admit Jews in similar numbers: &quot;If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect we should go a long way toward eliminating race feeling among the students.&quot;</p>
Though some suspected this was nothing but a covert way to decrease Jewish enrollment, the policy had the opposite effect.
He even persuaded one doubtful Overseer that this would not support discrimination against Jews as a group, but merely &quot;careful discernment of differences among individuals.&quot;
