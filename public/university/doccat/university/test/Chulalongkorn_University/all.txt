established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The demands of officials specialized in various fields by the government in the late 19th century Siam was an aftermath of King Chulalongkorn&#x2019;s bureaucratic reforms, which aimed to transform the feudal Thai society into a modernized state.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1899, the king founded the <strong>Civil Service Training School</strong> () near the northern gate of the <a>Royal Palace</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Those who graduated from the school would became royal pages.
established$$$@@@%%%Being royal pages, he must learn how to administrate organization by working closely with the king, which is a traditional way of entrance to Siamese bureaucracy.
established$$$@@@%%%After being royal pages, he would then served in the <a>Mahattai Ministry</a> or other government ministries.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>On April 1, 1902 the king thought the name of the school should be renamed to increase dignity of students and graduates.
established$$$@@@%%%Hence the name <strong>Royal Pages School</strong> () was later used.
established$$$@@@%%%Later, on January 1, 1911, King Vajiravudh renamed the school again to <strong>Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn</strong> () as a memorial to his father and moved the school to Windsor Palace () in the Pathumwan district.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The academic demands, however, increased all over the country as a whole as Siam was modernized.
established$$$@@@%%%King Vajiravudh then took the remaining funds of Chulalongkorn&#x2019;s Royal Equestrian Statue construction, which was collected from people.
established$$$@@@%%%Then combined with his own funds to subsidize the construction of a university campus.
established$$$@@@%%%The king organized various schools around the city proper into the Chulalongkorn's College.
established$$$@@@%%%The college offered 8 majors taught by 5 schools including;</p>
