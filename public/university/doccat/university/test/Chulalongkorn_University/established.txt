<p> <strong>Chulalongkorn University</strong> () (usually abbreviated as &quot;Chula&quot;) is the oldest <a>university</a> in <a>Thailand</a> and has long been considered the country's most prestigious university.
It is named after King <a>Chulalongkorn</a> (Rama V), and was established by his son and successor King <a>Vajiravudh</a> (Rama VI) in 1917 by combining the <a>Royal Pages School</a> and the College of Medicine.</p>
<p>Its campus occupies a vast area in downtown <a>Bangkok</a>, close to the popular teenagers' hangout, <a>Siam Square</a>, and adjacent to the most prestigious and private sports club, The Royal Bangkok Sports Club.
The symbol of the University is the <a>Phra Kiao</a>, a royal insignia.
Diplomas were traditionally handed out at graduation by the King of Thailand, created and begun by King <a>Prajadhipok</a> (Rama VII).
But at present, King <a>Bhumibol Adulyadej</a> (Rama IX) delegates the role to one of his daughters, Princess <a>Maha Chakri Sirindhorn</a>.</p>
<p>During the years 1973-1977 Princess <a>Maha Chakri Sirindhorn</a> was a student at the University, becoming the first member of the <a>Thai Royal Family</a> to graduate from a Thai university.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The demands of officials specialized in various fields by the government in the late 19th century Siam was an aftermath of King Chulalongkorn&#x2019;s bureaucratic reforms, which aimed to transform the feudal Thai society into a modernized state.
In 1899, the king founded the <strong>Civil Service Training School</strong> () near the northern gate of the <a>Royal Palace</a>.
Those who graduated from the school would became royal pages.
Being royal pages, he must learn how to administrate organization by working closely with the king, which is a traditional way of entrance to Siamese bureaucracy.
After being royal pages, he would then served in the <a>Mahattai Ministry</a> or other government ministries.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1902 the king thought the name of the school should be renamed to increase dignity of students and graduates.
Hence the name <strong>Royal Pages School</strong> () was later used.
Later, on January 1, 1911, King Vajiravudh renamed the school again to <strong>Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn</strong> () as a memorial to his father and moved the school to Windsor Palace () in the Pathumwan district.</p>
<p>The academic demands, however, increased all over the country as a whole as Siam was modernized.
King Vajiravudh then took the remaining funds of Chulalongkorn&#x2019;s Royal Equestrian Statue construction, which was collected from people.
Then combined with his own funds to subsidize the construction of a university campus.
The king organized various schools around the city proper into the Chulalongkorn's College.
The college offered 8 majors taught by 5 schools including;</p>
<li>School of International Relations in the Royal Palace</li>
<li><a>Royal Medical College</a> at Siriraj Hospital</li>
On March 26, 1917, the college was upgraded to the <strong>Chulalongkorn University</strong> () and the schools were transformed into four faculties;</p>
<p><a>250px|thumb|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, Faculty of Arts</a> The university firstly granted certificates to its graduates.
The education for a degree was then prepared.
The <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> reorganized the curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine.
In 1923, the Faculty of Medicine became the first faculty to accept students from the secondary education (known as <a>Mattayom</a>).
After the <a>1932 Revolution</a>, the <a>Khana Ratsadon</a> wanted the legal and political studies to be independent from &quot;royalists'&quot; Chulalongkorn University so they took the Faculty of Law and Political Science into their new <a>Thammasat University</a> in 1933.</p>
<p>In 1938, the Chulalongkorn University&#x2019;s Preparatory School was founded to provide pre-collegiate education for its students.
Those who managed to enter the university had to spent two years in the <a>Preparatory School</a> before going on to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The Preparatory School, however, ceded to be a preparatory school in 1947 and became <a>Triam Udom Suksa School</a>.
<p>During the 1930s to the 1950s Chulalongkorn University expanded to various fields including Pharmacy (1934), Veterinary Science (1935), Architecture (1939), Dentistry (1940), Commerce and Accountancy (1943), and Education (1957).
In 1943, however, the regency government under General <a>Phibun</a> separated the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science to become the University of Medical Sciences (now <a>Mahidol University</a>).
<p>Chulalongkorn University managed to claim back some of its lost faculties.
In 1967, the Faculty of Veterinary Science was returned from <a>Kasetsart University</a> and the <a>Faculty of Medicine</a> at <a>Chulalongkorn Hospital</a> was moved from <a>University of Medical Sciences</a> to Chulalongkorn University.
In 1972, the Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Pharmacy were retrieved.</p>

Chulalongkorn also has a Morals Network, which actively campaigns to protect student activities from damaging the university's reputation.

Later, the uniform was changed into more modernized version but original one is reserved as a formal uniform.
Dark blue necktie with colored Phra Kiao in its front is required for first year students but optional for higher years.
However, black tie with silver Phra Kiao pin is usually used by higher year students in some faculties.

<p>Rain tree is very common on the university campus.
It was deeply associated to the university since the past.
Fresh green leaves in the beginning of the semester represent freshmen's enjoyment.
