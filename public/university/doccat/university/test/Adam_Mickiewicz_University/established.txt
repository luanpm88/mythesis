Polonicum in [[S&#x0142;ubice]]|thumb]] <strong>Adam Mickiewicz University</strong> (, <a>lat.</a>
It opened on May 7, 1919, and since 1955 has carried the name of the Polish poet <a>Adam Mickiewicz</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was ceremonially opened on May 7, 1919 (the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Pozna&#x0144;'s <a>Lubra&#x0144;ski Academy</a>).
It was originally called <em>Wszechnica Piastowska</em> (&quot;University of the <a>Piasts</a>&quot; &#x2013; <em>wszechnica</em> is a less common Polish word for &quot;university&quot;), and in 1920 was renamed <em>Uniwersytet Pozna&#x0144;ski</em> (&quot;Pozna&#x0144; University&quot;).
For the first 20 years it educated students in law, economy, medicine, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, agriculture and forestry.</p>
<p>Since the moment of its foundation many distinguished scholars from all over the world as well as many outstanding personalities from politics and the fine arts have received the Honorary Degree of <em>Doctor Honoris Causa</em> of the University including Marshall <a>J&#x00f3;zef Pi&#x0142;sudski</a>, Marshall <a>Ferdinand Foch</a>, <a>Maria Sk&#x0142;odowska-Curie</a>, <a>Ignacy Paderewski</a>, <a>Roman Dmowski</a>, and <a>Witold Hensel</a>.</p>
<p>In 1920 famous <a>sociologist</a> <a>Florian Znaniecki</a> founded the first Polish department of <a>sociology</a> at the university.
It was one of the first such departments in Europe.</p>
<p>After the <a>invasion of Poland</a>, Pozna&#x0144; was <a>annexed by Germany</a> and the University was closed by the <a>Nazis</a> in 1939.
It was reopened as <a>a German university</a> in 1941, which operated until 1944.
Staff and students of the Polish university, many of them <a>resettled by Germans</a> to Warsaw, opened an underground Polish &quot;University of the Western Territories&quot; (<em>Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich</em>), whose classes met in private apartments (see <a>underground education in Poland</a>).
The Polish university reopened, in much smaller form, after the end of <a>World War II</a>.
In 1950, the Medical Faculty including the Dentistry section and the Faculty of Pharmacy were split off to form a separate institution, now the <a>Pozna&#x0144; University of Medical Sciences</a>.
<p>Adam Mickiewicz University continues to use a number of buildings in the city centre and in southern and western districts of Pozna&#x0144;.
However it is strongly developing its site at <a>Morasko</a> in the north of the city.
As of 2006, the faculties of physics, mathematics and computer science, chemistry, and geographical and geological science had moved to the new location.
The university also has external branches in other towns of western Poland, including <a>Kalisz</a>, <a>Ostr&#x00f3;w Wielkopolski</a> and <a>S&#x0142;ubice</a>.</p>
