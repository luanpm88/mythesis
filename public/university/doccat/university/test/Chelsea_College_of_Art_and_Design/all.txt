established$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>Polytechnic</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Chelsea College of Art and Design was originally an integral school of the <strong>South-Western Polytechnic</strong>, which opened at Manresa Road, <a>Chelsea</a>, in 1895 to provide scientific and technical education to <a>London</a>ers.
established$$$@@@%%%Day and evening classes for men and women were held in <a>domestic</a> <a>economy</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>natural science</a>, <a>art</a> and <a>music</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Art was taught from the beginning of the <a>Polytechnic</a>, and included <a>design</a>, <a>weaving</a>, <a>embroidery</a> and <a>electrodeposition</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The South-Western Polytechnic became the <strong>Chelsea Polytechnic</strong> in 1922 and taught a growing number of registered students of the <a>University of London</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>At the beginning of the 1930s, the School of Art began to widen, including courses in <a>craft</a> training and <a>commercial</a> design from 1931.
established$$$@@@%%%H.S Williamson, the school's appointed headmaster from 1930 to 1958, introduced <a>sculpture</a> shortly after <a>World War II</a>.
type$$$@@@%%%Notable artists from this period were employed as teachers such as <a>Henry Moore</a> and <a>Graham Sutherland</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%Alumni from this period included <a>Elizabeth Frink</a>, <a>Edward Burra</a>, <a>Patrick Caulfield</a>, <a>Ethel Walker</a>, <a>Dirk Bogarde</a>, <a>Robert Clatworthy</a>, <a>John Latham</a> and <a>John Berger</a>.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The School of Science separated and became known as the <strong>Chelsea College of Science and Technology</strong> in 1957, and was later admitted as a constituent College of the <a>University of London</a> in 1966.
established$$$@@@%%%The Chelsea College of Science and Technology was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1971 and merged with <a>King's College London</a> and <a>Queen Elizabeth College</a> in 1985.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h4>Chelsea School of Art</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The School of Art merged with the <strong>Hammersmith School of Art</strong>, founded by Francis Hawke, to form the <strong>Chelsea School of Art</strong> in 1908.
established$$$@@@%%%The newly formed school was taken over by the <a>London County Council</a> and a new building erected at Lime Grove, which opened with an extended curriculum.
established$$$@@@%%%A trade school for girls was erected on the same site in 1914.
established$$$@@@%%%The school acquired premises at <a>Great Titchfield Street</a>, and was jointly accommodated with <a>Quintin Hogg</a>'s <a>Polytechnic</a> in <a>Regent Street</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The campus at Manresa Road introduced <a>painting</a> and <a>graphic design</a> in 1963, with both disciplines being particularly successful.
established$$$@@@%%%During this period, Chelsea had the highest enrollment of <a>fine art</a> students in any school of its kind in the country, producing many notable artists such as <a>Ossip Zadkine</a>, <a>Mark Gertler</a> and <a>Paul Nash</a>.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Chelsea College of Art and Design (South Block)</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Lawrence Gowing</a>, <a>painter</a> and <a>art historian</a>, was appointed as the first headmaster of the Chelsea School of Art.
established$$$@@@%%%He was responsible for the integration of history and theory with practice, employing artists rather than art <a>historians</a> to teach art history and theory.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%This approach remains intrinsic to Chelsea's teaching philosophy today.
established$$$@@@%%%Under Gowing, an option programme was introduced, which encompassed workshops in experimental <a>music</a>, <a>poetry</a>, <a>psychoanalysis</a>, <a>philosophy</a> and <a>anthropology</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A basic design course, pioneered by <a>Victor Pasmore</a> and <a>Richard Hamilton</a>, was also developed during the same period, becoming the basis of the college's current <a>foundation course</a> in art and design.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>William Callaway, Head of School from 1989 to 1992, Colin Cina, appointed <a>dean</a> of <a>art</a>, and Bridget Jackson, <a>dean</a> of <a>design</a>, reformed the school and ensured the redevelopment of the entire academic program, introducing courses at multiple levels from <a>HND</a> to accredited <a>degrees</a>, which were validated by the <a>University of London</a>.</p>
website$$$@@@%%%<h4>London Institute</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Chelsea School of Art became a constituent College of the <strong>London Institute</strong> in 1986, formed by the <a>Inner London Education Authority</a> to associate London's art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure.
established$$$@@@%%%The school was renamed <strong>Chelsea College of Art and Design</strong> in 1989.
established$$$@@@%%%The London Institute was granted University status and was renamed <a>University of the Arts London</a> in 2004.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Professor Roger Wilson, appointed as the <a>dean</a> until his retirement in 2006, led the relocation to the <a>listed</a> <strong>Royal Army Medical College</strong>, renovated as a purpose built art college by the architects <a>Allies and Morrison</a> in 2005.
established$$$@@@%%%With this move, the Chelsea College of Art and Design presently resides next to <a>Tate Britain</a> at <a>Millbank</a>, returning to one standalone campus.</p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Exhibition</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The college comprises three notable on-site exhibition spaces: </p>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<ol>
type$$$@@@%%%  <li><a>Chelsea Space</a> is an international and interdisciplinary platform for professional practitioners to exhibit experimental curatorial projects.
established$$$@@@%%%The gallery also releases regular publications from participating <a>authors</a>, <a>artists</a> and <a>designers</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li><a>The Parade Ground</a>, situated within the college, has been transformed into <a>London</a>'s largest open-air gallery hosting events from film screenings to large scale installations in spring 2008.
established$$$@@@%%%The exhibition ground had previously been used for students and professionals as an open area platform, notably artist <a>Chris Burden</a>'s 'A Flying Steamroller' in 2006.
established$$$@@@%%%Recent exhibitions include <a>Cildo Meireles</a>'s 'Occasion', held in association with his exhibition at <a>Tate Modern</a> in 2008.

image_name$$$@@@%%%<h2>Other</h2>
image_name$$$@@@%%%<h4>CLIP CETL</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Chelsea and the <a>London College of Fashion</a> share the 'Creative Learning in Practice Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning' (CLIP CETL).
established$$$@@@%%%The Centre is funded by the British government in recognition of the two college's excellent results in developing student learning.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Newsman</a> and <a>writer</a> <a>John Humphrys</a>, <a>TV</a> <a>personalities</a> <a>Ulrika Jonsson</a> and <a>Clarissa Dickson-Wright</a>, <a>comedian</a> <a>Keith Allen</a>, and <a>BBC Radio 1</a> <a>DJ</a> Nihal Arthanayake, underwent an intensive two-week course at Chelsea in the <a>BBC</a> series Art School in 2005.
established$$$@@@%%%Under the guidance of the college's tutors, the students explored all aspects of art - from the basics of <a>drawing</a>, to <a>installation</a> and <a>performance art</a> - which culminated in an end of course show.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h4>Allocation of Space</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Arguably, one of the more controversial aspects of the college was the decision to provide its administrative arm an entire building to itself (North Block), despite the overcrowding suffered by the students throughout the rest of the college site.
established$$$@@@%%%This was touched upon in the May 2008 issue of <a>Art Monthly</a>, which dissects the often fractious relationship between the administrative and educational roles of the modern art college, made tangibly real in the allocation of space at Chelsea.</p>
