<p> The <strong>State University of New York at Fredonia</strong> (also known as <strong>SUNY Fredonia</strong>, <strong>Fredonia State University</strong> and formerly <em>SUNY College at Fredonia</em>) is a four-year liberal arts college located in <a>Fredonia, New York</a>; it is a constituent college of the <a>State University of New York</a>.
<p>SUNY Fredonia was one of the state <a>teachers' colleges</a> traditionally specializing in music education, but now offers a large number of programs in many areas, including a growing graduate division.
<p>The SUNY Fredonia campus, located in <a>Chautauqua County</a> (southwest of <a>Buffalo</a>) was designed by prominent architects <a>I.M. Pei</a> and <a>Henry N. Cobb</a> in 1968.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally opened in 1826 as Fredonia Academy under its first principal Austin Smith, the Academy enrolled eight students.
The first classes began on October 4, 1826.
Within one year the Academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls.</p>
<p>The Academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students.
The school was plagued by financial shortages, and was forced to close its doors in 1867.</p>
<h3>Normal School (1867&#x2013;1948)</h3>
<p>In 1867, the college emerged in its second phase of existence as a New York State Normal School.
On December 2, 1867, the Normal (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls.
For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation.
<p>During its 82 years of existence, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence.
<p>Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded.
In 1930,  of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus.
New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed the Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges.</p>
<h3>State University System (1948&#x2013;present)</h3>
<p>With the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958 and in 1960 Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree.
Previously, Fredonia's curriculum was restricted for teacher training only.</p>
<p>In 1968, the master plan for the central avenue campus was drafted by the highly respected architectural firm of I.M. Pei &amp; Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford.
A complex came into being that consisted of Jewett Hall (science), Dods Hall (health and physical education), and Rockefeller Arts Center(building for fine arts), administration, library, and an infirmary.
