country$$$@@@%%%<h3>Fredonia Academy (1826&#x2013;1867)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Originally opened in 1826 as Fredonia Academy under its first principal Austin Smith, the Academy enrolled eight students.
established$$$@@@%%%The first classes began on October 4, 1826.
established$$$@@@%%%Within one year the Academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students.
established$$$@@@%%%The school was plagued by financial shortages, and was forced to close its doors in 1867.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>Normal School (1867&#x2013;1948)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1867, the college emerged in its second phase of existence as a New York State Normal School.
established$$$@@@%%%On December 2, 1867, the Normal (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls.
established$$$@@@%%%For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation.
campus$$$@@@%%%Those students not studying for the teaching profession paid tuition and provided their own textbooks.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During its 82 years of existence, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence.
undergrad$$$@@@%%%With a fluctuating student enrollment and threats of state funding reductions, the school seemed to be in constant jeopardy of closing.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1930,  of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus.
affiliations$$$@@@%%%In 1938 a music building was constructed on the Central Avenue site.
established$$$@@@%%%New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed the Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<h3>State University System (1948&#x2013;present)</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>With the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958 and in 1960 Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree.
established$$$@@@%%%Previously, Fredonia's curriculum was restricted for teacher training only.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1968, the master plan for the central avenue campus was drafted by the highly respected architectural firm of I.M. Pei &amp; Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford.
established$$$@@@%%%A complex came into being that consisted of Jewett Hall (science), Dods Hall (health and physical education), and Rockefeller Arts Center(building for fine arts), administration, library, and an infirmary.
city$$$@@@%%%In 1970, Pei and Cobb returned to the SUNY Fredonia campus to complete the Erie Dining Hall and the suite-style residence halls.</p>
