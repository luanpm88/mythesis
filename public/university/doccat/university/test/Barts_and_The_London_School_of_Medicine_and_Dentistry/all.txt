established$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry</strong> is the <a>medical school</a> of <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a> (Queen Mary and Westfield College, <a>University of London</a>) and has existed in this form since 1995.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 2008 government Research Assessment Exercise, the School was ranked the top medical school for quality of research in London and ranked fourth in the UK.
established$$$@@@%%%The Dental School was ranked first equal in the UK.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school was formed in 1995 by the merger of the <strong>London Hospital Medical College</strong> (the oldest medical school in England and Wales, founded in 1785), the <strong>Medical College of St Bartholomew's Hospital</strong> (the hospital having been founded in about 1123 and teaching <a>medicine</a> from that date, initially as an apprenticeship until it formally became  a medical college in 1843) and Queen Mary and Westfield College (which began teaching medicine in 1989).
state$$$@@@%%%St Bartholomew's Hospital is, notably, the oldest remaining hospital in England.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school exists on three main sites, having a presence at Queen Mary's main (<a>Mile End</a>) campus as well as at the site of both of the former colleges at and near their respective hospitals, <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> (in <a>Smithfield</a>, <a>City of London</a> and nearby in <a>Charterhouse Square</a>), and the <a>Royal London Hospital</a> in <a>Whitechapel</a>, <a>Tower Hamlets</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%A new building (<a>Blizard Building</a>), named after the founder of The London Hospital Medical College, Sir William Blizard, has recently been completed at the Royal London site, and houses both laboratories and the main site for medical undergraduate teaching.

country$$$@@@%%%<h2>Research Assessment Exercise 2008</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), published in December 2008, confirmed Barts and The London as one of the UK&#x2019;s top four medical schools for the quality of research.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>The RAE is one of the few ways in which the academic quality of UK medical and dental schools can be compared and ranks research by two principal measures: the proportion of work graded 4* and 3* (see note below) &#x2013; that is world-leading or internationally recognised; and the Grade Point Average across the whole profile of the submission.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The results showed Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry joining Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh in the top 4 research-active medical schools in England, ranked by 4* and 3*  outputs and 5th overall by Grade Point Average.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>According to the rankings published in the Times Higher Education, Barts and the London scored consistently in the top five nationally:</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Dentistry was ranked 1st equal with Manchester, based on 3* and 4* outputs, and 2nd overall on Grade Point Average out of 14 dental schools.

established$$$@@@%%%<p>St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry was formed in 1995 by a merger of St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College with Queen Mary and Westfield College, now known as <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a>.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Medical College at the <a>Royal London Hospital</a>, England's first medical school, opened in 1785, pioneering a new kind of medical education providing teaching in theory as well as clinical skills.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A purpose-built lecture theatre was constructed at <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> in 1791 and in 1822 the Governors approved the provision of medical education within the Hospital.
established$$$@@@%%%Later a residential college was established, which moved to premises at <a>Charterhouse Square</a> in the 1930s.
established$$$@@@%%%At The London, larger premises, still in use in the present School of Medicine and Dentistry, were built in Turner Street in 1854.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1900 both medical colleges became constituent colleges of <a>University of London</a> in the Faculty of Medicine.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The Dental School opened at The London in 1911, acquiring the new Dental Institute and expanding student numbers during the 1960s.
established$$$@@@%%%Dental education developed during the 1970s, increasing the collaboration between dentists and other professionals.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Between the Wars, students at The London needing to complete a First MB (in Biology, Chemistry and Physics) attended Queen Mary College for a year before proceeding to Second MB at The London.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<p>Women students were first admitted to both colleges following World War II.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>A close association between the two medical colleges was developed following the Royal Commission on Medical Education in 1968, and new links with the then Queen Mary College were established at the same time.
image_size$$$@@@%%%In 1989 the pre-clinical teaching at the two medical colleges was merged and sited at the Basic Medical Sciences Building at Queen Mary.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1992, Barts, The London and the <a>London Chest Hospital</a> joined to form the (now) <a>Barts and The London NHS Trust</a>, with a full merger of the medical colleges with Queen Mary taking place three years later.
image_name$$$@@@%%%</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>Today Barts and The London is one of Britain's leading medical and dental schools with 1,600 undergraduate and 750 postgraduate students and a growing reputation for research across many disciplines.
established$$$@@@%%%The school is one of the <a>United Hospitals</a>, and competes under this banner as a united team for some sporting purposes, such as <a>United Hospitals RFC</a>.</p>
country$$$@@@%%%<h2>Barts and The London Students' Association</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Barts and The London Students' Association is the <a>students' union</a> for the <a>medical school</a>, a largely autonomous arm of <a>Queen Mary Students' Union</a> (QMSU) formed when the Students Union of <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School</a> and the <a>London Hospital Clubs Union</a> merged with QMSU at the time their parent bodies merged in 1995.
established$$$@@@%%%The medical school's Students' Association has a very distinct culture from that of QMSU with its own clubs and societies for most sports and activities, competing in the <a>National Association of Medics' Sports</a> against other <a>medsocs</a>.</p>
