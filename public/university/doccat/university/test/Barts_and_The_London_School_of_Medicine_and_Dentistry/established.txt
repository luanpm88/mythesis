<p><strong>Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry</strong> is the <a>medical school</a> of <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a> (Queen Mary and Westfield College, <a>University of London</a>) and has existed in this form since 1995.
<p>In the 2008 government Research Assessment Exercise, the School was ranked the top medical school for quality of research in London and ranked fourth in the UK.
The Dental School was ranked first equal in the UK.</p>
<p>The school was formed in 1995 by the merger of the <strong>London Hospital Medical College</strong> (the oldest medical school in England and Wales, founded in 1785), the <strong>Medical College of St Bartholomew's Hospital</strong> (the hospital having been founded in about 1123 and teaching <a>medicine</a> from that date, initially as an apprenticeship until it formally became  a medical college in 1843) and Queen Mary and Westfield College (which began teaching medicine in 1989).
<p>The school exists on three main sites, having a presence at Queen Mary's main (<a>Mile End</a>) campus as well as at the site of both of the former colleges at and near their respective hospitals, <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> (in <a>Smithfield</a>, <a>City of London</a> and nearby in <a>Charterhouse Square</a>), and the <a>Royal London Hospital</a> in <a>Whitechapel</a>, <a>Tower Hamlets</a>.
A new building (<a>Blizard Building</a>), named after the founder of The London Hospital Medical College, Sir William Blizard, has recently been completed at the Royal London site, and houses both laboratories and the main site for medical undergraduate teaching.
<p>The results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), published in December 2008, confirmed Barts and The London as one of the UK&#x2019;s top four medical schools for the quality of research.
<p>The results showed Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry joining Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh in the top 4 research-active medical schools in England, ranked by 4* and 3*  outputs and 5th overall by Grade Point Average.</p>
<p>Dentistry was ranked 1st equal with Manchester, based on 3* and 4* outputs, and 2nd overall on Grade Point Average out of 14 dental schools.

<p> Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry offers international levels of excellence in research and teaching.
We serve a diverse population in <a>East London</a> and the wider <a>Thames Gateway</a>, with a high prevalence of <a>diabetes</a>, <a>hypertension</a>, <a>heart disease</a>, <a>tuberculosis</a> and other chronic <a>lung disease</a>s, <a>HIV</a>, oral disease, and <a>cancer</a>.

<p>At the heart of the School&#x2019;s mission lies world class research, the result of a focused programme of recruitment of leading research groups from the UK and abroad, and a &#x00a3;100 million plus investment in state-of-the-art facilities.
Its fundamental mission, with its partner NHS Trusts, and other linked organisations, is to ensure that that the best possible clinical service is underpinned by the very latest developments in scientific and clinical research.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry was formed in 1995 by a merger of St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College with Queen Mary and Westfield College, now known as <a>Queen Mary, University of London</a>.
<p>The Medical College at the <a>Royal London Hospital</a>, England's first medical school, opened in 1785, pioneering a new kind of medical education providing teaching in theory as well as clinical skills.
<p>A purpose-built lecture theatre was constructed at <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> in 1791 and in 1822 the Governors approved the provision of medical education within the Hospital.
Later a residential college was established, which moved to premises at <a>Charterhouse Square</a> in the 1930s.
At The London, larger premises, still in use in the present School of Medicine and Dentistry, were built in Turner Street in 1854.
<p>In 1900 both medical colleges became constituent colleges of <a>University of London</a> in the Faculty of Medicine.
<p>The Dental School opened at The London in 1911, acquiring the new Dental Institute and expanding student numbers during the 1960s.
Dental education developed during the 1970s, increasing the collaboration between dentists and other professionals.
<p>Between the Wars, students at The London needing to complete a First MB (in Biology, Chemistry and Physics) attended Queen Mary College for a year before proceeding to Second MB at The London.
<p>A close association between the two medical colleges was developed following the Royal Commission on Medical Education in 1968, and new links with the then Queen Mary College were established at the same time.
In 1992, Barts, The London and the <a>London Chest Hospital</a> joined to form the (now) <a>Barts and The London NHS Trust</a>, with a full merger of the medical colleges with Queen Mary taking place three years later.
The school is one of the <a>United Hospitals</a>, and competes under this banner as a united team for some sporting purposes, such as <a>United Hospitals RFC</a>.</p>
<p>Barts and The London Students' Association is the <a>students' union</a> for the <a>medical school</a>, a largely autonomous arm of <a>Queen Mary Students' Union</a> (QMSU) formed when the Students Union of <a>St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School</a> and the <a>London Hospital Clubs Union</a> merged with QMSU at the time their parent bodies merged in 1995.
The medical school's Students' Association has a very distinct culture from that of QMSU with its own clubs and societies for most sports and activities, competing in the <a>National Association of Medics' Sports</a> against other <a>medsocs</a>.</p>
