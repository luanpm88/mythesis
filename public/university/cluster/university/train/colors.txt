<p>Basil Brewer wrote the school song &quot;The Purple and White&quot; in 1902, prompting the college to adopt school colors of purple and white.
By the close of the Wallace administration, the major accomplishment was the re-establishment of blue and white as IPFW&#x2019;s official school colors, which is a notable act of autonomy because IPFW is the only member of either the <a>Purdue</a> system or the <a>IU</a> system to have neither red nor crimson nor gold nor old gold as one of its school colors [6].
<p>The school colors are red and white (the school's football team uniforms featured gold trim) and the team mascot is the &quot;bronco,&quot; in past illustrations depicted as a &quot;<a>bucking bronco</a>.&quot;</p>
