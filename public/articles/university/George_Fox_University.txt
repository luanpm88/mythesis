<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded in <a>Newberg, Oregon</a>, in 1885 by <a>Quaker</a> pioneers, originally serving as Friends Pacific Academy for several years before becoming a college in 1891 as <strong>Pacific College</strong>. The Bruin mascot name comes from a real bear cub found in 1887, in the <a>Coast Range's</a> foothills near <a>Carlton</a>, about  west of Newberg. After the hide deteriorated, a leather replica was created and called Bruin Jr. Students today still participate in student-government-sponsored class competitions called &quot;Bruin brawls&quot; for possession of the Bruin Jr.</p>
<p>In 1893, the school was incorporated as a joint-stock company and became a four-year school in 1925. <a>Herbert Hoover</a>&#x2019;s uncle Dr. H. J. Minthorn served as the school&#x2019;s first president, and Hoover was an early student at the academy. After four decades in the <a>National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA), George Fox University and the Northwest Conference switched affiliation to the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> in 1998.</p>
<p>The George Fox baseball team's 2004 NCAA Division III national championship, was named one of the top 50 moments in Northwest Sports History by Portland radio station KFXX AM 1080, &quot;The Fan.&quot; Dwight Kimberly, an associate professor of biology, received the Carnegie Foundation's Oregon Professor of the Year award in 2000.</p>
