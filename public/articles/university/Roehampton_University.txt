<p><strong>Roehampton University</strong> is a <a>campus university</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, situated on three major sites at <a>Roehampton</a> in south-west <a>London</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Roehampton University is the successor to <strong>Roehampton Institute of Higher Education</strong> (RIHE), which was created in 1975. It was formed by the federation of four teacher training colleges with 19th century origins. The colleges, in order of foundation, were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a>Whitelands College</a></strong> &#x2013; an <a>Anglican</a> foundation (1841)</li>
  <li><strong><a>Southlands College</a></strong> &#x2013; a <a>Methodist</a> foundation (1872)</li>
  <li><strong><a>Digby Stuart College</a></strong> &#x2013; named after two pioneers in <a>Catholic</a> education (1874)</li>
  <li><strong><a>Froebel College</a></strong> &#x2013; established to promote the progressive educational philosophy of <a>Friedrich Fr&#x00f6;bel</a> (1892)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first ten years, the Institute's degrees were validated by the <a>University of London</a>.  Students at RIHE also had access to the University of London's facilities.</p>
<h3>Link to the University of Surrey</h3>
<p>After the 1983-84 academic year, Roehampton Institute broke its links with the University of London. Instead it formed a connection with the <a>University of Surrey</a>, and its graduates were awarded Surrey degrees.</p>
<p>The links with Surrey were strengthened considerably from 1 January 2000, when Roehampton Institute became an equal partner in the <a>Federal University of Surrey</a>, and changed its name to the <strong>University of Surrey Roehampton</strong>. The other partner was the original University of Surrey (&quot;UniS&quot;) based in <a>Guildford</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst working closely together, Roehampton and the University of Surrey functioned as independent, self-regulating universities. Both registered students independently, and Roehampton students continued to be taught on a Roehampton campus. As each institution controlled its own property, employed its own staff and registered its own students, applications were made to each institution separately. Applicants used distinct <a>UCAS</a> codes for both Roehampton and Surrey.</p>
<h3>University status</h3>
<p>In late 2003, the University of Surrey Roehampton announced that it would submit an application for independent university title to the <a>Department for Education and Skills</a>, and the application was submitted on 18 March 2004.  The name chosen was &quot;Roehampton University&quot;. The application was considered by the <a>Privy Council</a>, and on 23 June 2004 it was announced that independent university status was to be granted.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2004, the University of Surrey Roehampton became Roehampton University. Therefore the Federal University of Surrey was dissolved on this date.</p>
<p><a>John Simpson</a> became the first <a>Chancellor</a> of Roehampton University in 2005.</p>
<p><a>Paul O'Prey</a> is the current Chief Executive and Vice-Chancellor, supported by Deputy Vice-Chancellor <a>Jane Broadbent</a> and Pro Vice-Chancellors <a>Chris Cobb</a> and <a>Andy Masheter</a>. Reggie Blennerhassett is Director of Finance. Sir David Bell is Chair of Council.</p>
