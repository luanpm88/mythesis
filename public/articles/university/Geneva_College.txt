<p><strong>Geneva College</strong> is a <a>Christian</a> <a>liberal arts</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Beaver Falls</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>, north of <a>Pittsburgh</a>.  Founded in 1848, in <a>Northwood</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, the college moved to its present location in 1880, where it continues to educate a student body of about 1400 traditional undergraduates in over 30 majors, as well as graduate students in a handful of <a>master's</a> programs. It is the only <a>undergraduate</a> institution affiliated with the <a>Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America</a> (RPCNA). </p>
<p>The stated mission of the college is &quot;to glorify God by educating and ministering to a diverse community of students for the purpose of developing servant-leaders, transforming society for the kingdom of Christ.&quot; In 1967, the board of trustees adopted the &quot;Foundational Concepts of Christian Education,&quot; which continues to guide the institution. The college's undergraduate core curriculum emphasizes the <a>humanities</a> and the formation of a <a>Reformed</a> <a>Christian</a> <a>worldview</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Stone marking the original campus in Northwood</a></p>
<p>Geneva College was founded in 1848 in <a>Northwood</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, by John Black Johnston, a <a>minister</a> of the RPCNA. Originally called &quot;Geneva Hall&quot;, the college was named after the <a>Swiss center</a> of the <a>Reformed faith movement</a>.  After briefly closing during the <a>American Civil War</a>, the college continued operating in Northwood until 1880.  By that time, the college leadership had begun a search for alternate locations that were closer to urban areas.  After considering several locations in the <a>Midwest</a>, the denomination chose the <a>College Hill</a> neighborhood of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.  The college constructed its current campus on land donated by the <a>Harmony Society</a>. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was completed in 1881.</p>
<p>The most recent major campus construction project to be completed was the construction of the Rapp Technical Design Center in 2002.  A major project to reroute <a>Pennsylvania Route 18</a>, which runs through the campus, was completed in November 2007. Improvements to Reeves Stadium and the construction of a campus entrance and pedestrian mall were completed in time for the fall semester in 2009.</p>
<p>On December 15, 2006, the college filed a federal lawsuit against the state of Pennsylvania, alleging that a decision by the state to block the college from participating in the state sponsored <strong>CareerLink</strong> job service amounted to a violation of the college's <a>First Amendment</a> rights.  In response, the state argued that the college's requirement that faculty members subscribe to the Christian religion amounted to discrimination, to which the college responded that the faculty religious test constituted a <a>bona fide occupational qualification</a> under existing federal employment law.  The lawsuit was co-sponsored by the <a>Association of Faith-Based Organizations</a> and argued by the <a>Christian Legal Society</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2007, the college reached a settlement with <strong>CareerLink</strong> in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh. Geneva's right to access to <strong>CareerLink</strong> will be restored and the college will retain the statement on its employment applications stating,  &quot;Compliance with Geneva's Christian views is considered a bona fide occupational qualification ... and will have a direct impact on employment consideration.&quot;</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Geneva College is located in the College Hill neighborhood of Beaver Falls, to the north of downtown.</a> Two bodies oversee the administration of the college, the Board of Corporators and the Board of Trustees; while the Corporators are the official legal owners of the college, in practice most authority is delegated to the Trustees, who are elected by the Corporators.  Both Boards drafted the philosophical basis on which the college rests, known as the Foundational Concepts of Higher Education. The RPCNA still takes an active sponsorship and oversight role in the college: the college president, chaplain, and chairman of the Department of Biblical Studies must be members of the RPCNA, and all members of the Board of Corporators and the majority of the Board of Trustees must be RPCNA members. All professors and lecturers in the Department of Biblical Studies must subscribe to the <a>Westminster Confession of Faith</a>, and all full-time faculty and staff members must submit a written statement confessing faith in <a>Jesus Christ</a> and the <a>Christian religion</a>.</p>

<p>:<em>See <a>List of Geneva Golden Tornadoes head football coaches</a></em> <a>Football</a> competition began in 1890 under head coach William McCracken.  Over the years, the football team has amassed an all-time record of 496 wins, 437 losses, and 48 ties with five appearances in the <a>Victory Bowl</a>.

<h2>Culture and traditions</h2>
<p>Students must attend a designated number of weekly college-sponsored chapels to qualify for graduation. <a>Alcohol</a> is banned from the campus, and <a>tobacco</a> use is restricted to a purpose-built gazebo near Pearce Hall. <a>Greek letter fraternities and sororities</a> are not permitted. </p>
<p>One of the earliest college basketball games in the United States occurred at Geneva College on April 8, 1893 when the Geneva College Covenanters defeated the <a>New Brighton</a> <a>YMCA</a>.</p>
<p>Geneva was founded by <a>Scottish</a> and <a>Scots-Irish</a> immigrants.  Many names of campus buildings and areas bear Scottish names:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main meeting area of the Student Center is called <em>Skye Lounge</em> after the <a>Isle of Skye</a>.</li>
  <li>The restaurant-style eating area is called <em>The Brig</em>, short for <a>Brigadoon</a>, commemorating a play about a mythical <a>Highland</a> village.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geneva sports teams were nicknamed the <em>Covenanters</em> until the 1950s.  Members of the RPCNA are sometimes referred to as Covenanters because the denomination traces its roots to the <a>Covenanting tradition</a> of <a>Reformation era</a> <a>Scotland</a>.  The modern sports nickname of <em>Golden Tornadoes</em> commemorates the &quot;Golden Tornado&quot; of May 11, 1914 when a major <a>tornado</a> struck the college. Although the storm caused significant damage to the campus, there were no serious injuries.  College students and faculty rejoiced at what they believed was a sign of God's mercy.</p>
<p>Geneva's traditional sports rivalry is with <a>Westminster College</a> in nearby <a>New Wilmington, Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
