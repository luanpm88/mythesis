The Reynolda Campus, the university's main campus, is located north of downtown <a>Winston-Salem</a>, after the university moved there in 1956. The <a>Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center</a> campus is located nearby. The University also occupies lab space at the Bowman Gray Technical Center, at the downtown Piedmont Research Park, and at the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials. The University's <a>Babcock Graduate School of Management</a> maintains a presence on the main campus in Winston-Salem and in <a>Charlotte, North Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2011 U.S. News America's Best Colleges report, Wake Forest ranked 25th overall among national universities. Additionally, the same report ranked Wake Forest University 12th overall in terms of Best Undergraduate Teaching among national universities.</p>
<p>In the 2009 BusinessWeek Undergraduate Business Schools Rankings, the Calloway School of Business and Accountancy was ranked 14th overall, and #1 in terms of Academic Quality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wake Forest University was founded after the North Carolina <a>Baptist</a> State Convention purchased a  plantation from Dr. <a>Calvin Jones</a> in an area north of <a>Raleigh</a> (<a>Wake County</a>) called the &quot;Forest of Wake.&quot; The new school, designed to teach both Baptist ministers and laymen, opened on February 3, 1834, as the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, named because students and staff were required to spend half of each day doing manual labor on the plantation. Dr. <a>Samuel Wait</a>, a Baptist minister, was selected as the &quot;principal,&quot; later president, of the institute.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Wait Chapel located on the Hearn Plaza (or the 'Upper Quad').</a> In 1838, it was renamed Wake Forest College, and the manual labor system was abandoned. The town that grew up around the college came to be called the town of <a>Wake Forest</a>. In 1862, during the <a>American Civil War</a>, the school closed due to the loss of most students and some faculty to service in the <a>Confederate States Army</a>.  The College re-opened in 1866 and prospered over the next four decades under the leadership of presidents <a>Washington Manley Wingate</a>, <a>Thomas H. Pritchard</a>, and <a>Charles Taylor</a>. In 1894, the School of Law was established, followed by the School of Medicine in 1902. The university held its first summer session in 1921.</p>
<p>The leading college figure in the early 20th century was Dr. <a>William L. Poteat</a>, a gifted <a>biologist</a> and the first layman to be elected president in the college&#x2019;s history. &#x201c;Dr. Billy&#x201d; continued to promote growth, hired many outstanding professors, and expanded the <a>science</a> curriculum. He also stirred upheaval among North Carolina Baptists with his strong support of teaching the theory of <a>evolution</a> but eventually won formal support from the Baptist State Convention for academic freedom at the College.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Benson University Center</a> The School of Medicine moved to <a>Winston-Salem</a> (then North Carolina's second-largest city) in 1941 under the supervision of Dean <a>Coy Cornelius Carpenter</a>, who guided the school through the transition from a two-year to a four-year program. The school then became the <a>Bowman Gray</a> School of Medicine. The following year, 1942, Wake Forest admitted its first female undergraduate students, after <a>World War II</a> dramatically depleted the pool of male students.</p>
<p>In 1946, as a result of large gifts from the <a>Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation</a>, the entire college agreed to move to Winston-Salem, a move that was completed for the beginning of the fall 1956 term, under the leadership of Dr. Harold W. Tribble. Charles and Mary Babcock (daughter of <a>R. J. Reynolds</a>) donated to the college about  of fields and woods at &quot;Reynolda,&quot; their estate. From 1952 to 1956, fourteen new buildings were constructed on the new campus. These buildings were constructed in <a>Georgian</a> style.</p>
<p>The thirteenth president of Wake Forest is <a>Nathan O. Hatch</a>, former provost at the <a>University of Notre Dame</a>. Hatch was officially installed as president on October 20, 2005. He assumed office on July 1,  2005, succeeding <a>Thomas K. Hearn, Jr.</a>, who had retired after 22 years in office.</p>
<h3>Political, Social</h3>
<p>On March 17, 1978, <a>President Jimmy Carter</a> made a major National Security address in Wait Chapel. Twice the school has hosted <a>presidential debates</a>. The first, between then-Vice President <a>George H.W. Bush</a> and Governor <a>Michael Dukakis</a> on September 25, 1988. The second matched then-Governor <a>George W. Bush</a> against Vice President <a>Al Gore</a> on October 11, 2000.  Both debates were hosted in <a>Wait Chapel</a>.</p>
<p>In the predawn hours of April 18, 1978, students affixed a large Mickey Mouse to the  clock face of <a>Wait Chapel</a> facing the Quad. On September 13, 2007 <a>Wait Chapel</a> was the venue for a broadcast of <a>National Public Radio</a> (NPR) show, <a>Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me</a>. The show aired on September 15.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Since 1986, the university has produced 11 <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>s and numerous <a>Marshall</a> and <a>Fulbright</a> recipients.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>Wake Forest's undergraduate component consists of Wake Forest College (School of Arts and Science) and the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy. The university offers 34 majors and many interdisciplinary minors across various fields of study. In order to attend the Wayne Calloway School, students must make a special application to its program. The Calloway School offers a five-year accountancy program whereby a student earns a BS and an MS in Accountancy and qualifies to sit for the <a>CPA</a> exam after 5 years of combined undergraduate and graduate study.</p>
<p>In order to graduate, a Wake Forest student must finish a basic set of classes and a set of divisional classes. The basic set of classes includes a first-year seminar, a writing seminar, health and PE classes, and foreign language literature. The latter usually requires students to take additional languages classes first. Languages available include Spanish, French, German, Latin, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and others.</p>
<p>About 89% of Wake Forest professors hold the terminal degree in their field. Wake Forest professors are expected to excel in both teaching and scholarship.</p>
<p>Wake Forest offers a number of <a>study abroad</a> programs for its undergraduates and, in the summers, for its <a>law school</a> students. About half of Wake Forest undergraduates spend at least one semester abroad. <a>thumb|Wait Chapel at night.</a></p>

The school currently lists 12 faculty, 15 adjunct faculty, and 15 associated faculty from other university departments.</p>
<p>While the idea had been around for many years, long-range planning for the university's divinity school began in April 1989.  In May 1996, Bill J. Leonard was appointed the school's first dean.  Leonard soon began describing the school as students, faculty, and staff continue to describe it today, &quot;Christian by tradition, ecumenical in outlook, and Baptist in heritage.&quot;  In March 1998, the school announced selections for its 14 member board of visitors.  The first faculty members were named in April 1998, and additional faculty were hired that October. In August 1999, 19 women and five men became the first 24 students to enroll in the program. The university's first 20 Master of Divinity degrees were conferred May 20, 2002.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p>Wake Forest's Greek life is unusual in that the Greeks do not have houses concentrated in a &quot;Greek Row.&quot; Instead Greeks occupy lounges adjoining halls of a greater building. These areas are spread out evenly across campus, with the exception of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which has its residence off campus. Approximately 50% of the undergraduate student body is Greek.</p>
<p>Fraternities on campus: <a>Alpha Sigma Phi</a>, <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, <a>Chi Psi</a>, <a>Delta Kappa Epsilon</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Order</a>,  <a>Kappa Alpha Psi</a>, <a>Kappa Kappa Psi</a>, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, <a>Lambda Chi Alpha</a>, <a>Phi Beta Sigma</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, <a>Sigma Chi</a>, <a>Sigma Nu</a>, <a>Sigma Pi</a>, <a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>, and <a>Theta Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Wake Forest is also home to the Sigma Delta chapter of <a>Order of Omega</a>, an honor society for members of Greek organizations. Members are selected from the top 3% of Greeks on campus based high standards in the areas of scholarship, leadership, and involvement within their respective organization and within the Greek, campus and local communities.</p>
<h3>Physical activity options</h3>
<p>Wake Forest offers a vast array of possibilities for physical activity, be it for recreation or health. The university offers classes in <a>Yoga</a>, Dance, Boot Camp, etc. In addition, some classes are offered for credit on sports theory and practice, as well as several dance courses. Intramural Sports are also extremely popular and take place for a variety of sports, depending on the season.  The university rec center, Reynolds Gym, is the oldest gym in the ACC.  The university is in the planning process for a new rec center to replace the aging Reynolds Gym and the now inadequate Miller Fitness Center.</p>
<h3>Dining facilities</h3>
<p>Every Wake Forest undergraduate student who lives on campus is required to sign up for some form of a meal plan in coordination with <a>Aramark</a>. The meals can be consumed in the main dining facility known as &quot;The Pit&quot; or the <a>Magnolia</a> Room, both of which are located at Reynolda Hall, in the center of the campus. At the neighboring Benson Center, students can buy food and snacks independent of their meal plan from Aramark or from <a>Chick-fil-A</a>. A <a>Subway</a> is also located on campus, off Hearn Plaza.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2005, Aramark, through its Fresh Foods Company, renovated &quot;The Pit&quot; in an attempt to improve the quality of the dining experience. The newly renovated area contains a variety a food stations with a &quot;cooked upon order&quot; service.  As of October 6, 2008, there has been a full-service <a>Starbucks</a> in the library.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|&quot;Rolling the Quad&quot; is a WFU tradition that is done after major victories in athletic competition.</a> <a>right|thumb|Wake Forest University Mascot Demon Deacon</a></p>
<p>Originally, Wake Forest's athletic teams were known as the Fighting Baptists, due to its association with the Baptist Convention (from which it later separated itself). However, in 1923, after a particularly impressive win against the <a>Duke</a> <a>Blue Devils</a>, a newspaper reporter wrote that the Deacons &quot;fought like Demons&quot;, giving rise to the current team name, the &quot;<strong><a>Demon Deacon</a>s</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Wake Forest has won a total of eight national championships in four different sports; four of these championships have come in the past six years. Wake Forest is sometimes referred to as being a part of &quot;<a>Tobacco Road</a>&quot; or &quot;The Big Four,&quot; terms that refer to the four North Carolina schools that compete heatedly against each other within the ACC; these include <a>Duke</a>, <a>North Carolina</a>, and <a>North Carolina State</a>, as well as Wake Forest.</p>
<p>The Demon Deacons participate in the <a>NCAA's</a> Division I (in the <a>Bowl Subdivision</a> for <a>football</a>) and in the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Athletics Director</a> is Ron Wellman.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>2006 Season</h4>
<p> Wake Forest's football team was ranked in the Top 25 in the nation by the <a>AP Poll</a> during most of the 2006 season. They won the 2006 ACC Atlantic Division Title and went on to defeat the <a>Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a> 9-6 on December 2 in the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, FL. The win sent Wake Forest to the <a>Orange Bowl</a> to play the Big East champion <a>Louisville Cardinals</a>, where they lost 24-13. However, this made Wake Forest the smallest school to ever compete in the <a>Bowl Championship Series</a>. Of all schools that play Division I FBS football, only <a>Rice</a> and <a>Tulsa</a> have smaller undergraduate enrollments, and Wake has the smallest undergraduate enrollment of any school in the <a>BCS conference</a>s.</p>
<p>For his part in the record-setting season, coach <a>Jim Grobe</a> was unanimously selected ACC Coach of the Year, and handily won the AP Coach of the Year award several weeks later. Coach Grobe signed a ten-year contract in 2003.</p>
<h4>2007 Season</h4>
<p> Wake Forest followed its success in 2006 with another excellent year and finished the regular season with a record of 8 wins and 4 losses. During the season, the Demon Deacons were briefly ranked in the Top 25. Their success throughout the year earned Wake Forest an invitation to the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Played on December 29 in the Bank of America stadium (home of the Carolina Panthers) the Demon Deacons defeated the Connecticut Huskies 24-10.</p>
<p>Wake Forest's head coach, Jim Grobe, continues to garner national attention as an outstanding college football coach. Though he was offered coaching positions at other schools, Grobe chose to remain with the Deacons, citing a desire to remain at an institution that successfully balances high-level academics with a major athletic program.</p>
<p>Wake Forest plays its home football games at <a>BB&amp;T Field</a> (formerly Groves Stadium).</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> Wake Forest is generally regarded as a competitive program in men's <a>basketball</a>, frequently qualifying for the <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a> (20 times in the school's history). They reached the <a>Final Four</a> once, in 1962. The school's famous basketball alumni include <a>Billy Packer</a>, a guard on the 1962 Final Four team who became far more famous as a basketball broadcaster; Tyrone Curtis <a>&quot;Muggsy&quot; Bogues</a>, the shortest player ever to play in the <a>NBA</a>; <a>Randolph Childress</a>, for his MVP performance in the 1995 ACC Tournament; <a>Washington Wizards</a> star <a>Josh Howard</a>; <a>Chris Paul</a> of the <a>New Orleans Hornets</a> and the 2006 <a>NBA Rookie of the Year Award</a>; and two-time league MVP and three-time <a>NBA Finals</a> MVP <a>Tim Duncan</a>. <a>Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> is the home venue for the Demon Deacons basketball team. <a>Skip Prosser</a>, Wake Forest University's men's basketball coach since 2001, died in Winston-Salem on July 26, 2007. One of Prosser's assistant coaches, <a>Dino Gaudio</a>, was named to replace him.  On April 13, 2010, <a>Jeff Bzdelik</a> was hired, taking the place of the recently fired Gaudio.</p>
<h3>Women's basketball</h3>
<p>Wake Forest is generally regarded as a competitive program in women's <a>basketball</a>, frequently qualifying for the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. <a>Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> is the home venue for the Demon Deacons basketball team. <a>Mike Petersen</a>, Wake Forest University's women's basketball coach is in his 5th season and is excited about the upcoming season.  Candice Jackson joins Bob Clark as the team assistant coaches.</p>
<h3>Women's field hockey</h3>
<p>Recent athletic honors include three consecutive <a>NCAA</a> <a>Field Hockey</a> <a>national championships</a> in 2002, 2003, and 2004 under Head Coach <a>Jennifer Averill</a>. In 2005, the Deacs were defeated in the semifinal round by <a>Duke University</a>, and in the 2006 championship game by the <a>University of Maryland</a>.</p>
<h3>Golf</h3>
<p>Wake Forest has had several successful <a>golf</a> teams, winning <a>national championships</a> in 1974, 1975, and 1986. Several well-known players include <a>Arnold Palmer</a>, <a>Lanny Wadkins</a>, <a>Darren Clarke</a>, <a>Jay Haas</a>, <a>Curtis Strange</a>, Billy Andrade, Gary Halberg, <a>Robert Wrenn</a>, <a>Scott Hoch</a>, <a>Webb Simpson</a>, and <a>Bill Haas</a>.</p>

<p>  Wake Forest is a consistent <a>national title</a> contender in men's <a>soccer</a>. In recent years several players from the program have played professionally in <a>Major League Soccer</a>, including <a>Brian Carroll</a>, <a>Will Hesmer</a>, <a>Justin Moose</a>, <a>Michael Parkhurst</a>, <a>Pat Phelan</a>, <a>James Riley</a>, <a>Scott Sealy</a>, <a>Matt Taylor</a>, and <a>Wells Thompson</a>. In 2006 the team advanced to the final four of the NCAA tournament where they were defeated in a penalty kick shootout by the <a>University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. They captured the <a>2007 NCAA Men's Soccer Championship</a> defeating Ohio State 2-1, with the winning goal scored by <a>Zack Schilawski</a>.  The Demon Deacons returned to the final four of the <a>2009 Division I Men's College Cup</a>, losing to the <a>University of Virginia</a> 2-1 in overtime in the semifinals.</p>
<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p> Wake Forest won the <a>1955 College World Series</a> in <a>baseball</a>. In 2009, the team began playing on <a>Ernie Shore Field</a>, in <a>Winston-Salem</a>, NC, moving to this field from their former home at <a>Gene Hooks Stadium</a> on campus.  </p>
<h3>Screamin' Demons</h3>
<p>Student attendance of <a>Wake Forest Football</a> and <a>Basketball</a> games is high, in part due to the program known as &quot;Screamin' Demons.&quot; At the beginning of each respective athletic season students on the Reynolda Campus can sign up for the program whereby they pay $15 for each season; in addition to the best seats at the games, this gets students a football shirt in the fall and a tie-dye t-shirt in the spring along with a card that serves as an automatic pass to the sporting events. They lose this privilege if they miss two of the games. Through the planning of Sports Marketing and the Screamin' Demons program, basketball game seats in the students section are difficult to attain without participating in the Screamin' Demons program. The arena can seat only 2,250 of the 4,500 undergraduate students at Wake Forest. At least 150 seats are always set aside for non-Screamin Demons, who sit behind the 2,100 member group.</p>
<h2>Student organizations</h2>
<p>There are over 160 chartered student organizations of all sorts. Student sports organizations are highly visible on campus. Special interest organizations range from the academic, such the <a>Model United Nations</a> team, to the artistic, such as the <a>handbell</a> choir. In spring of 2006, the <a>Mock Trial</a> team was notable in qualifying for the national tournament while only in its 2nd year in operation. Religious organizations are also numerous. Both the <a>College Republicans</a> and <a>College Democrats</a> have active chapters at the University. Historic student organizations such as the Philomathesians, an artistic literary magazine, are also present. Students are entertained by numerous performing groups, including The Lilting Banshee Comedy Troupe.</p>
<p>The Office of Student Development, led by <a>Michael Gerald Ford</a>, son of <a>Gerald R. Ford</a>, oversees all student organizations. Student Development also organizes leadership oriented student activities such as LEAD, a semester long course in campus leadership.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Service Corps</h3>
<p>The Volunteer Service Corps (VSC) is one of the most popular student organizations. It coordinates volunteering in both the local and international/national setting via service projects and trips. The organization has annual service trips to Russia, Vietnam, and Latin America. In light of the disaster caused by <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>, VSC sent 30 Wake Students on a Wake Alternative Spring Break in the Spring of 2006.</p>
<h3>A cappella groups</h3>
<p>Wake Forest has a number of vibrant <a>a cappella</a> groups that produce annual records and have popular performances on and off campus. They include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Chi Rho</a> - award winning all male Christian group</li>
  <li>Innuendo - mixed gender a cappella group</li>
  <li>Plead the Fifth [<a>http://www.wfupleadthefifth.com</a>]- all male group </li>
  <li><a>Minor Variation</a>- all female Christian group</li>
  <li>Demon Divas - all female group</li>
</ul>
<h3>Army ROTC</h3>
<p>Wake Forest University offers only Army ROTC. In 2006 the Army ROTC program was awarded the MacArthur Award by the <a>United States Army</a> for having the best medium sized ROTC battalion in the nation. There are about sixty cadets in the program, and about half of each military science class finishes Leadership Development Advanced Camp (<a>LDAC</a>) as a &quot;Distinguished Military Graduate,&quot; the top 20% of ROTC graduates.</p>
<p>The minimum service commitment of a contracted cadet who graduates from ROTC is four years active duty and four years of inactive reserve duty after that. Alternatively, a cadet can choose to forgo active duty service and serve eight straight years in the active Reserve or National Guard. Other alternative service plans are available for those who intend to be an Army doctor, lawyer, or chaplain with source of commissioning via ROTC.</p>
<p>At Wake Forest contracted ROTC cadets are given full scholarship, a monthly stipend, and book money by the US Army. The university extends the scholarship with free room and board.</p>
<p>The program also serves students from <a>Winston-Salem State University</a> and <a>Salem College</a>.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Wake Forest has received praise for its efforts in the field of technology. In 2003, The Princeton Review listed it as the number two &quot;Most Connected Campus&quot; in the <a>United States</a>. The University's Information Systems (IS) department has a program that issues new <a>Lenovo ThinkPad</a> laptop computers to all undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. High speed wireless and wired Internet access is now provided across campus. For undergraduate students living on campus, the university provides Resident Technology Advisors (RTAs), undergraduate students who also live on campus, trained to aid students with technical help for their laptops.</p>
<p>Information Systems, in cooperations with high technology firms like <a>IBM</a>, <a>Cingular</a>, and <a>HP</a>, also actively engage in technology testing with members of the student body. These selected students participate through either co-payment or leasing plans in experimental uses of technology in education and college life through <a>IS Research and Development</a>.
