<h2>Special programs</h2>
<p><strong>Honors Program</strong></p>
<p>The Honors Program at St. Thomas Aquinas College is designed for students of superior academic ability with a decided commitment to humane values. The Program reflects the declared mission of the College as an institution committed to both the search for truth through the enlightenment that comes from knowledge and to human freedom that is an outgrowth of seeking the truth.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Honors Program at St. Thomas Aquinas College, which was implemented in 1987, are student centered and may be expressed as follows:</p>
<p>to experience the inter-relatedness of knowledge from various disciplines;</p>
<p>to deepen a passion for knowledge that goes beyond the more formal aspects of education;</p>
<p>to experience that the search for truth is timeless and never ending;</p>
<p>to realize the necessity of discipline in scholarly pursuits;</p>
<p>to appreciate more fully the broad array of gifts of all persons.</p>
<p>Students who are selected for admission to the Honors Program will have their academic schedules modified to include special courses taught by versatile professors dedicated to the humane objectives of the Program. Over the several semesters of their attendance at St. Thomas Aquinas College these students will be invited to enroll in a series of Honors courses, beginning with special sections of freshman English and followed by advanced courses on particular topics in a variety of disciplines. Some of these courses will be interdisciplinary in nature and may be team-taught. The Honors Program encompasses the four years of undergraduate study during which students are expected to complete a minimum of six Honors courses.</p>
<p>Applicants to the Honors Program are strongly encouraged to apply early. Completed applications are considered on a rolling basis, and admission to the Honors Program is highly competitive.</p>
<p>Application to the Honors Program is open to new freshmen entering college as full time students in the Fall semester who meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>High school average of 90 or above in major subjects at the time of application, and</p>
<p>Combined SAT scores of at least 1200 with no section less than 550 or ACT composite score of 27.</p>
<p>Evidence of a rigorous course of study in high school (usually includes honors and/or AP courses).</p>
<p>Evidence of substantial involvement in extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>
<p>Pathways, formerly known as &quot;The STAC Exchange,&quot; is a program serving selected college students with learning disabilities and/or attention deficit disorders at St. Thomas Aquinas College. The program emphasizes individualized support and personal attention in a comfortable atmosphere conducive to education.</p>
<p>The STAC Exchange was established at St. Thomas Aquinas College in 1982 to meet the growing need for specialized services at the college level for bright students with learning disabilities. In an effort to serve this population, STAC researched, developed, and implemented a pilot program for select high school graduates with the potential to earn a college degree. The STAC Exchange has adapted to the increasing diversity of college students with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders, with an emphasis on individualized services. In September 2004, the program's name was changed to &quot;Pathways,&quot; a name that better reflects its mission.</p>
<p>Pathways focuses on the development of effective learning strategies by critically evaluating and educating each student about his or her specific needs and abilities. The aim is to break the pattern of dependency often created in students with learning deficits, to foster a spirit of independent and active learning, to teach students to maximize strengths in order to compensate for weaknesses, and to inspire confidence in the student's own abilities.</p>
<p>Pathways students represent almost every major the College offers, often attaining academic honors as they work toward their degree. After graduation, some Pathways alumni have pursued graduate study at such institutions as Fordham University, New York University, Iona College, and John Jay College; some have remained at STAC to pursue master's degrees in Education or Business. Pathways graduates are employed in a wide variety of positions, including special education teacher, high school teacher, college instructor, recreation therapist, school psychologist, police officer, radio broadcaster, national park ranger, mortgage broker, and small business owner.</p>
