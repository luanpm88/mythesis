<h2>History</h2>
<p>PUT was officially founded in 1955 and the first rector was Roman Kozak. But a state school had existed in <a>Pozna&#x0144;</a> since  1919, under name of the Higher State School of Machinery. After adding a second department in 1929, its name was changed to the Higher State School of Machinery and Electrotechnics. It was supposed to became the University of Technology in 1940, but its development was interrupted by <a>World War II</a>. In 1945 the school received the status of Higher Engineering School and in 1955 it became the University of Technology.</p>
<h2>Successes</h2>
<p>Students from computer science faculty started few times in CSIDC computer systems projecting world championships organised by IEEE Computer Society and ImagineCup (Microsoft). Four different teams in 2001&#x2014;2006 managed by Dr of engineering eng. Jan Kniat were 3 times world champions and 2 times on the dais. Many graduates from Computer science and Management faculty work in Microsoft corporation in Redmond (Washington USA)</p>
<h2>Other information</h2>
<p>The current rector is Professor and Doctor in Engineering Adam Hamrol.</p>
<p>PUT is a member of <a>CESAER Association</a> and was the first Polish technical university to receive membership of that organisation.  <a>Jan W&#x0119;glarz</a>, <a>Roman S&#x0142;owi&#x0144;ski</a>, <a>Jacek B&#x0142;a&#x017c;ewicz</a>, <a>Jerzy Brzezi&#x0144;ski</a> are the best-known staff of the Computer Science department.</p>
