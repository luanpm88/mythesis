<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>18th and 19th centuries</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|St Joseph's Squares, South Campus</a> The university and St Patrick's College, Maynooth have a common history from 1795 to 1997. The college in Maynooth was established by the government as a college for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students in 1795, the lay college was based from 1802 in Riverstown House on the south campus, with the opening of <a>Clongowes Wood</a>, the lay college which had lay trustees was closed in 1817 and it functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years. In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the <a>Catholic University of Ireland</a>, and later offered <a>Royal University of Ireland</a> degrees in arts and science. The Pontifical Charter was granted to the college in 1896.</p>
<h3>20th and 21st centuries</h3>
<p>The college became a recognised college of the National University of Ireland in 1910, and from this time its arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland and the <a>Pontifical University</a> of Maynooth continued to confer its degrees, as theology degrees were prohibited in the Royal University of Ireland, and its successor the National University of Ireland until 1997.</p>
<p>In 1966 the college allowed again the entry of lay students; this greatly expanded the college and essentially set the foundation stone for the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. In 1997 the Universities Act resulted in the transfer of the faculties of arts, Celtic studies, philosophy and science of the <em>recognised college</em> of St Patrick's College to the new university. The university has also expanded into finance and engineering since its creation in 1997. In 2007 the university added business studies, followed by law in 2008.</p>
<p>Any person who was a student of St Patrick's College, Maynooth and was conferred with a National University of Ireland degree as a result prior to the creation of the university is legally considered a graduate of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p>
<p>In 1994, W.J. Smyth, BA, PhD, LLD, was appointed to the position of Master of St. Patrick's College Maynooth(NUI), in 1997 this position became President of NUIM. In 2004 W.J Smyth was succeeded by Prof. John Hughes as president of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p>
