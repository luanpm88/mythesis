<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though officially created with the merger of the <a>Richmond Professional Institute</a> (RPI) and <a>Medical College of Virginia</a> (MCV) in 1968, VCU's history stretches back to 1838 when the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College opened in Richmond. In 1854, the Richmond Department of Medicine broke away from <a>Hampden-Sydney College</a> and became an independent institution known as the Medical College of Virginia. Richmond Professional Institute traces its roots back to 1917, when it began as the Richmond School of Social Work. VCU recognizes 1838 on its official seal and on promotional materials. </p>

<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Improperly awarded bachelor's degree</h3>
<p>In May 2008, an anonymous email led to an investigation that discovered VCU  awarded an undergraduate degree to former Richmond Police Chief Rodney Monroe improperly after he enrolled to receive just 6 credits from the University, with the bulk of his credits taken through the online University of Phoenix and the FBI Academy. </p>
<p>VCU officials announced they had taken personnel actions in response to the improper degree but did not indicate what actions were taken or who was held responsible. In the wake of the internal investigation, five high-ranking administrative officials resigned , some vocally in protest of the investigation itself due to threats made against the tenure status of one professor if she did not cooperate and other high-pressure tactics. </p>
<p>The University submitted a report about the improperly awarded degree and the subsequent investigation to its accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which at its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, Dec. 8-9, concluded that VCU &quot;had taken adequate steps to ensure that this was indeed a one-time phenomenon.&quot; SACS concluded that no warnings or sanctions would result and complimented VCU on the professional way it handled the situation.</p>
<p>In the report, VCU admitted to making 37 exceptions to university policy in granting an undergraduate degree to Monroe, who had satisfied only 15 of 28 requirements for his bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies. Unlike other cases of improperly awarded degrees, VCU did not rescind the degree. The Virginia General Assembly is looking into the University's actions both in improperly awarding the degree and in conducting the investigation.</p>
