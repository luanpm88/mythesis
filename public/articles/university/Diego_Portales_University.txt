<p><strong>Diego Portales University</strong> () is one of the first private <a>universities</a> founded in <a>Chile</a> and is named after the Chilean statesman <a>Diego Portales</a>.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, the University has consistently been focused on academic improvement, which has led UDP to be positioned as one of the best universities in Chile.   </p>
<p>UDP has campuses <a>(virtual tour)</a> in the <em>Barrio Universitario de Santiago</em></p>
<p>UDP is nationally recognized for its academic programs in business, law, psychology, and journalism. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Universidad Diego Portales (UDP) was founded in 1982. It was an initiative of the founders of the &quot;Professional Institute of Sales and Advertising (IPEVE)&quot; which at that time (1963) had already been in existence for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>In 1983, the University embarked on its academic programme with the creation of three faculties: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Administrative Sciences, and the Faculty of Psychology. In 1989, two new faculties were created, the Faculty of Information and Communications and the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1991, the University voluntarily decided to undergo the process of national accreditation with the aim of subsequently attaining the status of Autonomous University. </p>
<p>On March 18 1993, the Superior Council for Education in plenary session ratified Universidad Diego Portales as successfully fulfilling its institutional mission, for which it was designated as having &#x201c;Full Institutional Autonomy&#x201d;, authorized to bestow all categories of academic degree and title independently. Since 1993, the University has embarked on a process of consolidation and growth in its academic programme.</p>
<p>In 1994, degree courses in Advertising and Design were transferred from IPEVE to Universidad Diego Portales, and the Bachelor of Arts degree programme was introduced. Five years later in 1999, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Fine Arts was created and the Faculty of Humanities founded.</p>
<p>In 2002, Universidad Diego Portales took a transcendental step in its growth as an academic institution with the creation of new programs and its incursion into two new fields of knowledge: Health and Education.</p>
<p>Aware of the tremendous challenges in the fields of education and the pursuit of excellence, UDP that same year designed a plan for long-term infrastructural growth, involving the issue of a Security Bond guaranteed by the World Bank for the sum of approximately US$ 25 million, thus becoming the first educational institution to utilize this type of financing.</p>
<p>In 2004 Universidad Diego Portales became one of the first private universities to achieve institutional accreditation as a university from the National Undergraduate Accreditation Commission (CNAP) in three areas: Institutional Management, Undergraduate Teaching, and Equipment and Infrastructure. This recognition confirms the quality standards of the institution and demonstrates once again the ongoing academic, institutional and infrastructural efforts and achievements of UDP since its inception in the realm of private-sector higher education.</p>
<h2>Mission and Strategic Orientation</h2>
<p>Universidad Diego Portales is a private non-profit foundation whose objective is higher education. Inasmuch, it cultivates and disseminates teaching, research, reasoning and culture.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this purpose and to provide adequately for national needs and interests, its specific aims are:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>To promote the research, creation, conservation and transmission of universal knowledge and the cultivation of science, arts and letters; to contribute to the spiritual and cultural development of the country, in keeping with its traditional historical values; to train competent graduates and professionals equipped with the knowledge and capacity needed to exercise their respective professions; to bestow all levels of academic degree, especially that of Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree, Master&#x2019;s Degree and Doctor of Philosophy, and professional degrees in the fields of Juridical Sciences, Health, Economics, Business, Social and Human Resource Administration, the Humanities, Engineering Sciences, Communications, Architecture, Design, Fine Arts and others</em>&quot;. </p>
<p>As an institution of advanced learning, Universidad Diego Portales has as its mission statement the vision &#x201c;<em>To discover the Space-Time of Truth, Goodness and Beauty in the human being, in society and in nature</em>&#x201d;. In this context, there is a conscious assumption of a public duty to society and an undertaking to train individuals who would serve as role-models and standards of reference, based on the human being as the source of intellectual probing and academic research.</p>
<p>Within this strategic orientation, focus is retained on the academic programme and, more specifically, on three axes of work, namely: Attitude and Behaviour, centred both on academic factors and on increasing the competitiveness of degree courses, in the constant pursuit of quality, excellence and merit; Research for Chile which seeks in-depth commitment and involvement with the country aimed at achieving insertion, integration and participation between the Public- and Private Sectors, in which academic research and findings based upon truth, goodness and the beauty of human beings, society and nature aspire to contribute to the formation of social innovators of vision and realism; and The Development of International Links which, through the differentiation of professors and students from a Latin American perspective, endeavours to work in foreign markets (student and academic staff exchanges).</p>
