<p><strong>Dartmouth College</strong> (, ) is a <a>private</a>, <a>Ivy League</a> university, comprising a liberal arts college, <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>, <a>Thayer School of Engineering</a>, and <a>Tuck School of Business</a>, as well as 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnwr-aag&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>. Incorporated as &quot;Trustees of Dartmouth College,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;irs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of the nine <a>Colonial Colleges</a> founded before the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With an undergraduate enrollment of 4,196 and a total student enrollment of 5,987, Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Enrollment&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth College was established in 1769 by <a>Congregational</a> minister <a>Eleazar Wheelock</a>. After a long period of financial and political struggles, Dartmouth emerged from relative obscurity in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth alumni, from <a>Daniel Webster</a> to the many donors in the 19th and 20th centuries, have been famously involved in their college.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihe-alum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth is located on a rural 269-acre (1.1&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) campus in the <a>Upper Valley</a> region of New Hampshire. Given the College's isolated location, participation in athletics and the school's <a>Greek system</a> is high.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the <a>Ivy League</a> conference of the <a>NCAA</a> Division I. Students are well-known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Dartmouth was founded by <a>Eleazar Wheelock</a>, a <a>Puritan</a> minister from Connecticut, who had previously sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment largely resulted from his relationship with <a>Mohegan</a> Indian <a>Samson Occom</a>. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock's tutelage from 1743 to 1747 and later moved to <a>Long Island</a> to preach to the Montauks.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Wheelock instituted Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school&#x2019;s operations. To this end, Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money in the churches of that nation. With the funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; The head of the trust was <a>William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The Charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of <a>King George III of Great Britain</a>.]] Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution;primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand his school into a college, Wheelock relocated his educational enterprise to Hanover, in the <a>Province of New Hampshire</a>. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, <a>John Wentworth</a>, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, conveyed the charter from <a>King George III</a> establishing the College. That charter created a college &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land ... and also of English Youth and any others.&quot; The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for <a>William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth</a> &#x2014; an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it &#x2014; Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The College granted its first degrees in 1771 .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new College as one primarily for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called <a>Brothertown Indians</a> in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;/&gt; [[File:Early Dartmouth Dunham.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest known image of Dartmouth appeared in the February 1793 issue of <em>Massachusetts Magazine</em>. The engraving may also be the first visual proof of [[cricket]] being played in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CricketRauner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic <a>Dartmouth College case</a>, in which the State of <a>New Hampshire</a>'s 1816 attempt to amend the College's royal charter to make the school a public university was challenged. An institution called <a>Dartmouth University</a> occupied the College buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the College continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; <a>Daniel Webster</a>, an <a>alumnus</a> of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the <a>Supreme Court of the United States</a>, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an <a>illegal impairment of a contract</a> by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the College. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous and frequently quoted words: &quot;It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the College had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Under the presidency of <a>William Jewett Tucker</a> (1893&#x2013;1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor <a>John Ordronaux</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having &quot;refounded Dartmouth&quot; and bringing it into national prestige.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|right|Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth Hall, circa 1834.</a>Presidents <a>Ernest Fox Nichols</a> (1909&#x2013;16) and <a>Ernest Martin Hopkins</a> (1916&#x2013;45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing <a>selective admissions</a> in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; <a>John Sloan Dickey</a>, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1970, longtime professor of <a>mathematics</a> and <a>computer science</a> <a>John George Kemeny</a> became president of Dartmouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;kemeny-bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kemeny presided over several major changes at the College. Dartmouth, previously serving as a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the College adopted its &quot;<a>Dartmouth Plan</a>&quot; of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;kemeny-bio&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>During the 1990s, the College saw a major academic overhaul under President <a>James O. Freedman</a> and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the College's history, which as of January 2008 has surpassed $1 billion and is on schedule to be completed before 2010.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, <a>Booz Allen Hamilton</a> selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance &quot;whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,&quot; citing <em><a>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a></em> and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;; section on Dartmouth College footnoted to John R. Thelin, who also selected the <a>University of Oxford</a> for inclusion as a model of institutional endurance.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the <a>Board of Trustees</a> starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing ideological conflict.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; President <a>James Wright</a> announced his retirement in February 2008&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician <a>Jim Yong Kim</a> on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the <a>Matariki Network of Universities</a> (MNU) together with <a>Durham University</a> (UK), <a>Queen&#x2019;s University</a> (Canada), <a>University of Otago</a> (New Zealand), <a>University of T&#x00fc;bingen</a> (Germany), <a>University of Western Australia</a> (Australia) and <a>Uppsala University</a> (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Academics and administration</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Dartmouth, a <a>liberal arts</a> institution, offers only a four-year <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree to undergraduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are 39 academic departments offering 56 <a>major programs</a>, although students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the most popular majors were economics, government, history, psychological and brain sciences, English, biology, and engineering sciences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Department, whose prominent professors include <a>Stephen Brooks</a>, <a>Richard Ned Lebow</a>, and <a>William Wohlforth</a>, was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the <a>London School of Economics</a> in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;<a>psr_11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The Economics Department also holds the distinction as the top-ranked economics program in the world where a masters as well as a doctorate degree is not offered.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten &quot;distributive requirements&quot; in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt; Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in &quot;independent, sustained work,&quot; culminating in the production of a <a>thesis</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt; In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in nineteen Arts &amp; Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs trace their origins to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a> (established 1797), <a>Thayer School of Engineering</a> (1867) &#x2014; which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences &#x2014; and <a>Tuck School of Business</a> (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of &quot;Dartmouth University&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as <em><a>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a></em>), the school uses the name &quot;Dartmouth College&quot; to refer to the entire institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth employs a total of 597 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the <a>Dartmouth Conferences</a>, the <a>Dartmouth Time Sharing System</a>, <a>Dartmouth BASIC</a>, and <a>Dartmouth ALGOL 30</a>. As of 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the <a>University Press of New England</a>, a <a>university press</a> founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<h3>The Dartmouth Plan</h3>
<p>[[File:BakerLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]] Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week <a>academic term</a>s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply &quot;D-Plan&quot;) is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During all other terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;/&gt; The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for twelve total terms over the course of their academic career.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as &quot;a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|McNutt Hall, the location of the Department of Admissions &amp; Financial Aid</a> Dartmouth describes itself as &quot;highly selective,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ranked as the fifteenth &quot;toughest to get into&quot; school by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and classified as &quot;most selective&quot; by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>. For the class of 2014, a record 18,778 students applied for approximately 1,100 places, and 11.5% of applicants were admitted. 95.3% of admitted students were ranked in the top 10% of their high school graduating class. 39.9% of admitted students were valedictorians and 11.9% were salutatorians. The mean SAT scores of admitted students by section were 733 for verbal, 741 for math, and 740 for writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014-admissions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dartmouth was ranked ninth among undergraduate programs at national universities by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews-gen-list&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Dartmouth is ranked in a category for national <a>research universities</a>, some Dartmouth students and administrators have questioned the fairness of the ranking given the College's emphasis on undergraduate education.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth's strength in undergraduate education is highlighted by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> when in 2009 and 2010 it ranked Dartmouth first in undergraduate teaching at national universities, ahead of Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Brown, Duke, and Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth ranks number seven in the Wall Street Journal's ranking of top feeder schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classification listed Dartmouth as the only &quot;majority-undergraduate&quot;, &quot;arts-and-sciences focus[ed]&quot;, &quot;research university&quot; in the country that also had &quot;some graduate coexistence&quot; and &quot;very high research activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=<a>http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=182670&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq=</a>{%22ipug2005_ids%22%3A%224%22%2C%22ipgrad2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22enrprofile2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ugprfile2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22sizeset2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22basic2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22eng2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22search_string%22%3A%22%22%2C%22first_letter%22%3A%22%22%2C%22level%22%3A%22%22%2C%22control%22%3A%22%22%2C%22accred%22%3A%22%22%2C%22state%22%3A%22%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22%22%2C%22urbanicity%22%3A%22%22%2C%22womens%22%3A%22%22%2C%22hbcu%22%3A%22%22%2C%22hsi%22%3A%22%22%2C%22tribal%22%3A%22%22%2C%22msi%22%3A%22%22%2C%22landgrant%22%3A%22%22%2C%22coplac%22%3A%22%22%2C%22urban%22%3A%22%22} |title=Carnegie Classifications &#124; Institution Profile |publisher=Classifications.carnegiefoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a <a>need-blind basis</a>. Beginning in the 2008&#x2013;2009 academic year, Dartmouth instituted a new <a>financial aid</a> policy extending need-blind admission to international students and replaced all <a>student loans</a> with scholarships and grants. Students from families with a combined annual income of less than $75,000 are not charged any tuition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early 2010, the College announced that it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning in the 2011&#x2013;2012 school year due to its changed financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Board of Trustees</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Dartmouth Hall, built in 1784</a> Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the College president (<em>ex officio</em>), the state governor (<em>ex officio</em>), thirteen trustees nominated and elected by the board (called &quot;charter trustees&quot;), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (&quot;alumni trustees&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.</p>
<p>Although the Board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Dartmouth College is situated in the rural town of <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, located in the <a>Upper Valley</a> along the <a>Connecticut River</a> in <a>New England</a>. Its 269&nbsp;acre (1.1&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) campus is centered on a five-acre (two-hectare) &quot;<a>Green</a>&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a former field of <a>pine trees</a> cleared by the College in 1771.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmo-green&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;irs&quot;/&gt; In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500&nbsp;acres (18.2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of <a>Mount Moosilauke</a> in the <a>White Mountains Region</a>&lt;ref&gt;<em>Dartmouth Outing Guide</em> p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 27,000&nbsp;acre (109&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the <a>Second College Grant</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the College) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the <a>Georgian</a> <a>American colonial</a> style,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Academic facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Hopkins Center</a> The College's creative and performing arts facility is the <a>Hopkins Center for the Arts</a> (&quot;the Hop&quot;). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;hop-info&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by the famed architect <a>Wallace Harrison</a>, who would later design the similar-looking fa&#x00e7;ade of <a>Manhattan's</a> <a>Metropolitan Opera House</a> at the <a>Lincoln Center</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.&lt;ref name=&quot;hop-info&quot;/&gt; The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (&quot;Hinman boxes&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Courtyard Caf&#x00e9; dining facility.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hop is connected to the <a>Hood Museum of Art</a>, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-20 09.JPG|thumb|left|A view of the Sherman Fairchild Physical Science Center and Wheeler Hall from the tower of [[Baker Memorial Library]]]] In addition to its nineteen graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a> is located in a complex on the north side of campus&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</a>, located several miles to the south in <a>Lebanon, New Hampshire</a>, contains a 396-bed <a>teaching hospital</a> for the Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>Thayer School of Engineering</a> and the <a>Tuck School of Business</a> are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;/&gt; The Thayer School presently comprises two buildings;&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;/&gt; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuck-campus&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuck-campus&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, comprising <a>Baker Memorial Library</a> (opened 1928) and Berry Library (opened 2000&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;). Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's  tower is an iconic symbol of the College.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Athletic facilities</h3>
<p>[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Memorial Field 02.JPG|thumb|right|[[Memorial Field (Dartmouth College)|Memorial Field]]]] Dartmouth's original sports field was <a>the Green</a>, where students played <a>cricket</a> and <a>old division football</a> during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmo-green&quot;/&gt; Today, Dartmouth maintains more than a dozen athletic facilities and fields&lt;ref name=&quot;dcaf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has spent more than $70 million in facility improvements since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Most of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcaf&quot;/&gt; The center of athletic life is the <a>Alumni Gymnasium</a>, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-mile (123&nbsp;m) indoor track.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (<a>Leede Arena</a>), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is <a>Memorial Field</a>, a 15,000-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby <a>Thompson Arena</a>, designed by Italian engineer <a>Pier Luigi Nervi</a> and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also visible from Memorial Field is the Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track.</p>
<p>Dartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse, located along the Connecticut River, the <a>Hanover Country Club</a>, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The College also maintains the <a>Dartmouth Skiway</a>, a 100&nbsp;acre (0.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in <a>Lyme Center, New Hampshire</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Housing and student life facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Lord Hall in the Gold Coast Cluster</a> Instead of ungrouped dormitories or <a>residential colleges</a>, Dartmouth has nine residential communities located throughout campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dormitories vary in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt; Since 2006, the College has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by College.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates eleven dining establishments around campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Four of them are located at the center of campus in Thayer Dining Hall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the &quot;student union&quot; or &quot;campus center.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a caf&#x00e9;, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the <a>Academic Skills Center</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson Hall, next door to both Collis and Thayer, contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the <a>Dartmouth Outing Club</a> and <em><a>The Dartmouth</a></em> daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>In 2006, <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> ranked Dartmouth third in its &quot;Quality of Life&quot; category, and sixth for having the &quot;Happiest Students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt; in all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations.</p>
<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p> [[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-03 Robinson Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Robinson Hall houses many of the College's student-run organizations, including the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]]. The building is a designated stop along the <a>Appalachian Trail</a>.]]</p>
<p>Dartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, the College hosts eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 &quot;issue-oriented&quot; groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the <a>Dartmouth Outing Club</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;DOCalumnimag&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the nationally recognized&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Big Green Bus</a>, the controversial conservative newspaper <em><a>The Dartmouth Review</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <em><a>The Dartmouth</a></em>, arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;nlestk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <em>The Dartmouth</em> describes itself as &quot;America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;nlestk&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Partially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the <a>Greek system</a> dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth is home to 27 recognized Greek houses: 15 fraternities, nine sororities, and three coeducational organizations.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, over 60% of eligible students belong to a Greek organization;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to <a>desegregate</a> fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create <a>coeducational</a> Greek houses in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become &quot;substantially coeducational&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; this attempt to the change the Greek system eventually failed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The College has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as <a>undergraduate societies</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> [[File:Darthmouth vs Princeton 1.jpg|thumb|left|A Dartmouth varsity hockey game against Princeton at [[Thompson Arena]]]]</p>
<p>Approximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Dartmouth College fields 34 intercollegiate varsity teams: 16 for men, 16 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) <a>Division I</a> eight-member <a>Ivy League</a> conference; some teams also participate in the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a> (ECAC).&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-athletics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-athletics&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes in many other sports including track and field, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, rugby union and lacrosse.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The College also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as rugby, water polo, figure skating, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The figure skating team has performed particularly well in recent years, winning the national championship in each of the past five consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has also been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport over many years. In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a  swim and three terms of physical education.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Students at a bank of Blitz terminals in Baker-Berry Library.</a> Technology plays an important role in student life, as Dartmouth has been ranked as one of the technologically most advanced colleges in the world (as in <em><a>Newsweek</a><strong>s 2004 ranking of &quot;Hottest for the Tech-Savvy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>Yahoo!</a>'s 1998 &quot;Wired Colleges&quot; list&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;). <a>BlitzMail</a>, the campus <a>e-mail</a> network, plays a tremendous role in social life, as students tend to use it for communication in lieu of <a>cellular phones</a> or <a>instant messaging</a> programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Student reliance on BlitzMail (known colloquially as &quot;Blitz,&quot; which functions as both noun and verb&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;/&gt;) is reflected by the presence of about 100 public computer terminals intended specifically for BlitzMail use.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;/&gt; Since 1991, Dartmouth students have been required to own a personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p>In 2001, Dartmouth became the first Ivy League institution to offer entirely ubiquitous wireless internet access.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;/&gt; With over 1,400 access points, the network is available throughout all College buildings as well as in most public outdoor spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing at Dartmouth&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other technologies being pioneered include College-wide Video-on-Demand and VoIP rollouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Public Affairs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Native Americans at Dartmouth</h3>
<p>It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College, granted to <a>Eleazar Wheelock</a> in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wheelock primarily intended the College to educate white youth and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named <a>Samson Occom</a>, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The College graduated only nineteen Native Americans during its first two hundred years.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt; In 1970, the College established Native American academic and social programs as part of a &quot;new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt; Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 500 Native American students from over 120 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|upright|Snow sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival</a></p>
<p>Dartmouth is well-known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The College functions on a <a>quarter system</a>, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as &quot;big weekends&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steph&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;party weekends&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;/&gt; Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdr-wc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the <a>Connecticut River</a>. Begun in 1986, Tubestock met its demise in 2006 when Hanover town ordinances and a lack of coherent student protest conspired to defeat the popular tradition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run <a>Dartmouth Outing Club</a> trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the <a>Moosilauke Ravine Lodge</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 85% of freshman elected to participate.</p>
<h2>Insignia and other representations</h2>
<h3>Motto and song</h3>
<p>Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is &quot;Vox Clamantis in Deserto&quot;. The Latin motto is literally translated as &quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; but is more often rendered as &quot;A voice crying in the wilderness&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which attempts to translate the <a>synecdoche</a> of the phrase. The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the College's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hovey's &quot;<a>Men of Dartmouth</a>&quot; was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and became the school's official song in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song was retitled to &quot;Alma Mater&quot; in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.&lt;ref name=&quot;rscl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Seal</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|upright|left|Seal of Dartmouth College</a></p>
<p>Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a <a>seal</a> for use on official documents and diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; The College's founder <a>Eleazar Wheelock</a> designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the <a>Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</a>, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by Commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:</p>
<p></p>
<p>On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer <a>W. A. Dwiggins</a> to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769,&quot; to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of &quot;1769&quot; to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Shield</h3>
<p>On October 28, 1926, the Trustees approved a &quot;Dartmouth College Shield&quot; for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944 the trustees approved another <a>coat of arms</a> based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer <a>Thoreau MacDonald</a>. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot; around 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 microns across.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The design has appeared on <a>Rudolph Ruzicka</a>'s Bicentennial Medal (<a>Philadelphia Mint</a>, 1969) and elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Nickname, symbol, and mascot</h3>
<p><a>thumb|upright|Keggy posing on the Dartmouth College Green with Baker Memorial Library in the background.</a> Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname &quot;The Big Green,&quot; originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (&quot;Dartmouth Green&quot;) as the school's official color in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;greencolor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History-of-Dartmouth-Hanover&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname &quot;the Indians,&quot; a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;/&gt; This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the &quot;use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, <em><a>The Dartmouth Review</a></em>, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but no team has worn the symbol on its uniform in decades.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has become &quot;official.&quot; One proposal devised by the College humor magazine the <em><a>Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern</a></em> was <a>Keggy the Keg</a>, an <a>anthropomorphic</a> beer keg who makes occasional appearances at College sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the mascot has only received approval from the student government.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the &quot;Dartmoose&quot; as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p> Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihe-alum&quot;/&gt; Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. In 2007, Dartmouth was ranked second only to <a>Princeton University</a> in the U.S. for alumni donation rates by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews-gen-list&quot;/&gt; According to a 2008 article in <em><a>The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Alumni income</h3>
<p>According to Payscale, Dartmouth College alums have among the highest average starting salaries ($58,200) in the United States, as well as the absolute highest average income ten years after graduation ($129,000).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>In 2010, the senior class gift fund-raiser led to charges of strong-arming by Dartmouth College, which had student volunteers pressure and hassle students who refused to donate. In particular, Dartmouth College released particulars of senior students who refused to donate as a pressure tactic. This was in order to meet a 100% participation rate, which was a condition for a $100 000 gift by the class of 1960.</p>
<p>Specifically, the name and photo of a senior student, Laura A. Delorenzo (the only senior student who refused to donate, on the basis of being morally opposed), was released via the student newspaper and student blog.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was then widely reported in the news media and blogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In response to the media reports, Dartmouth College stated that it regretted the releasing of the personal particulars of the student in question, and that it was &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; to have done so,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; but defended its actions as being necessary in order to obtain the donations. As such, they would be retaining their current program structure and no administrative actions will be taken against the administrator responsible for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
<p>Dartmouth College has appeared in or been referenced by a number of popular media.</p>
<p>The 1978 comedy film <em><a>National Lampoon's Animal House</a></em> was cowritten by <a>Chris Miller</a> '63, and is based loosely on a series of stories he wrote about his fraternity days at Dartmouth. In a CNN interview, <a>John Landis</a> said the movie was &quot;based on Chris Miller's real fraternity at Dartmouth,&quot; <a>Alpha Delta Phi</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth's <a>Winter Carnival</a> tradition was the subject of the 1939 film <em>Winter Carnival</em> starring <a>Ann Sheridan</a> and written by <a>Budd Schulberg</a> '36 and <a>F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdr-wc&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Dartmouth College has been mentioned three times on the FOX animated sitcom, <em><a>The Simpsons</a></em>, with two of the three occurring on season 11 episodes and associating Dartmouth College with alcoholic consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpsons archive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On &quot;<a>Alone Again, Natura-Diddily</a>&quot;, a Christian rock singer named Rachel Jordan sings that she &quot;was drinking like a Dartmouth boy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;<a>Pygmoelian</a>&quot;, during the Duff Days festival, Duffman introduces the trick-pouring contest by saying that it counts as course credit at Dartmouth College.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpsons archive&quot;/&gt; In the 1969 movie &quot;<a>Goodbye, Columbus</a>, Richard Benjamin finds out all the men at a party are from Dartmouth. The Association, a popular rock group at the time, recorded the soundtrack and performed an instrumental during the scene entitled &quot;Dartmouth? Dartmouth!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In addition, Dartmouth has served as the alma mater for a number of fictional characters, including <a>Stephen Colbert</a>'s <a>fictional persona</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Michael Corleone</a> of <em><a>The Godfather</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Meredith Grey</a> of <em><a>Grey's Anatomy</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Crown of <em><a>The Thomas Crown Affair</a></em> (1968),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Howie Archibald of <em><a>Gossip Girl</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Pete Lattimer</a> of <a>Warehouse 13</a> and <a>Pete Campbell</a> of <a>Mad Men</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The characters Evan and Fogell of the 2007 film <em><a>Superbad</a></em> were also slated to attend Dartmouth.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the vampire romance series <em><a>Twilight</a></em>, main characters <a>Bella Swan</a> and <a>Edward Cullen</a> plan to go to Dartmouth as a ruse. In the second season of <em><a>Scrubs</a></em>, J.D. argues that not all surgeons are stupid and cites as proof the fact that another doctor at the hospital had attended Dartmouth. Dartmouth is repeatedly referenced in the 1990s sit-com &quot;Newsradio.&quot;  The character Dan Rydell in the short lived series <a>Sports Night</a> was a Dartmouth alumnus, a subject that is mentioned in numerous episodes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In <a>The Last of the Mohicans</a>, Hawkeye says he attended Reverend Wheelock's school which is presumably Dartmouth. In the television show <em><a>The West Wing</a></em>, <a>President Bartlet</a> was a tenured professor at Dartmouth before beginning his political career.</p>
