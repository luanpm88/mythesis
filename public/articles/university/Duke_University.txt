<p>  <strong>Duke University</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Durham, North Carolina</a>, <a>United States</a>. Founded by <a>Methodists</a> and <a>Quakers</a> in the present-day town of <a>Trinity</a> in 1838, the school moved to <a>Durham</a> in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, tobacco industrialist <a>James Buchanan Duke</a> established <a>The Duke Endowment</a>, prompting the institution to change its name in honor of his deceased father, <a>Washington Duke</a>.</p>
<p>The University is organized into two <a>undergraduate</a>, ten <a>graduate</a> and professional schools, and seven institutes. In its 2011 edition, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the university's undergraduate program 9th among national universities,&lt;ref name=&quot;USNEWS&quot;&gt;<a>America's Best Colleges 2011</a>. <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>, 2010.

<p>Besides academics, research, and athletics, Duke is also well known for its sizable campus and <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture, especially the <a>Duke Chapel</a>. The forests surrounding parts of the campus belie the University's proximity to downtown Durham. Duke's 8,610&nbsp;acres (35&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) contain three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in <a>Beaufort</a>. Construction projects have updated both the freshmen-populated <a>Georgian-style</a> East Campus and the main Gothic-style West Campus, as well as the adjacent <a>Medical Center</a> over the past five years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p><a>thumb|One of the first buildings on the original Durham campus (East Campus), the Washington Duke Building (&quot;Old Main&quot;) was destroyed by a fire in 1911.</a> Duke started as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in 1838, in <a>Randolph County</a> in the present-day town of <a>Trinity</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Brown's Schoolhouse was organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of <a>Methodists</a> and <a>Quakers</a>, and in 1841 North Carolina issued a charter for Union Institute Academy. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the <a>Methodist Church</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;  In 1892, Trinity moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from <a>Washington Duke</a> and <a>Julian S. Carr</a>, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;/&gt; Washington Duke gave what was then known as Trinity College a $100,000 endowment in 1896, with the stipulation that the college &quot;open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1924, Washington Duke's son, <a>James B. Duke</a>, established <a>The Duke Endowment</a> with a $40 million ($434 million in <a>2005 dollars</a>) trust fund. The annual income of the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, three colleges, and Trinity College. <a>William Preston Few</a>, the president of Trinity College, insisted that the university be named Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish itself from the myriad of other colleges and universities carrying the &quot;Trinity&quot; name.  At first, James B. Duke thought the name change might come off as self-serving, but eventually he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;/&gt; Money from the endowment allowed the University to grow quickly. Duke's original campus (East Campus) was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with Georgian-style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the Collegiate Gothic style buildings on the campus one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west were completed, and construction on West Campus culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;chapel&quot;&gt;<a>Duke University Chapel</a>.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:JamesDukeStatueAndChapel1.jpg|left|thumb|[[James Buchanan Duke|James B.

<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p>Engineering, which had been taught since 1903, became a <a>separate school</a> in 1939. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the only <a>Rose Bowl</a> ever played outside California in <a>Wallace Wade Stadium</a> in 1942.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 1963, the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Slavery and Segregation at Duke | Duke Human Rights Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Increased <a>activism</a> on campus during the 1960s prompted <a>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> to speak at the University on the civil rights movement's progress on November 13, 1964. The former <a>governor of North Carolina</a>, <a>Terry Sanford</a>, was elected president in 1969, propelling <a>The Fuqua School of Business</a>'s opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the <a>Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs</a> (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the <a>liberal arts</a> college for both men and women in 1972. Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Duke Annual Report 2000/2001-Interdisciplinary</a>. <em>Duke University Annual Report</em>, 2001.

Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near <a>Cameron Indoor Stadium</a>, an area known as <a>Krzyzewskiville</a>, or K-ville for short. There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent. At night, K-ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert.
