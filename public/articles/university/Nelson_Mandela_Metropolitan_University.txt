<h2>History, formation and campus developments</h2>
<p>NMMU was formed through the merger of the following institutions: The <strong>PE Technikon</strong>, which had its roots in the Port Elizabeth Art School founded in 1882 (the oldest art school in South Africa). The institution later became the <strong>College for Advanced Technical Education</strong> (CATE). The college moved from Central to the coastal suburb of <a>Summerstrand</a> in 1974 and became the PE Technikon in 1979. The PE Technikon expanded to the Western Cape in 1985 when it took over the College for Forestry, <a>Saasveld</a>, from the Department of Forestry. The Teachers&#x2019; Training College, located opposite The Boardwalk Waterfront Complex [<a>http://www.suninternational.com/DESTINATIONS/CASINOS/BOARDWALK/Pages/default.aspx</a>] in Summerstrand, was taken over by the Technikon in 1994.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Port Elizabeth</strong> (UPE) was the country&#x2019;s first dual-medium (<a>English</a> and <a>Afrikaans</a>) residential university, came into being on 31 January 1964, and was assisted by financing and donations of land from the <a>Broederbond</a>. The first <a>academic year</a> commenced on 1 March 1965. UPE moved from Central to Summerstrand in 1974. The campus was officially opened in August 1975 and the final move from Bird Street came in 1979 with the opening of the science blocks at Summerstrand. The University of Port Elizabeth's campus is now what is the NMMU Summerstrand South Campus. The Summertrand South campus, is the largest campus of any university in the southern hemisphere of the world. Built on 830 ha of land donated by the then Port Elizabeth City Council, the campus was declared a nature reserve in 1983. It is the only <a>university</a> in South Africa to be situated on a nature reserve and the only university to offer game drives on its campus! The downside of being located on a wildlife reserve is that students are often attacked by monkeys (see: <a>http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2007/09/21/news/n07_21092007.htm</a> ). Three of the five Port Elizabeth campuses are situated close to <a>Humewood Beach</a> which has been awarded <a>blue flag</a> status.</p>
