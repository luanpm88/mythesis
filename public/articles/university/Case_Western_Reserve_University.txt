<p> <strong>Case Western Reserve University</strong> (also known as <strong>Case Western</strong>, <strong>Case</strong>, and <strong>CWRU</strong> &quot;crew&quot;) is a private research university located in <a>Cleveland, Ohio</a>, USA. The university was created in 1967 by the federation of Case Institute of Technology (founded in 1881 by philanthropist <a>Leonard Case Jr.</a>) and Western Reserve University (founded in 1826 in the area that was once the <a>Connecticut Western Reserve</a>). <a>TIME magazine</a> described the merger as the creation of &quot;Cleveland's Big-Leaguer&quot; university. </p>
<p>As of 2008&#x2013;2009, the university had 4,356 undergraduates and 5,458 graduate and professional students. In <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report's</em> 2010 rankings, Case Western Reserve's undergraduate program ranked 41st among national universities. The University is associated with <a>16 Nobel Laureates</a>. Case Western is particularly well known for its <a>medical school</a>, its law school, its <a>dental school</a>, and its biomedical teaching and research capabilities.  Case Western is a member of the Association of American Universities.</p>
<p>The university is approximately five miles (8&nbsp;km) east of downtown Cleveland in <a>University Circle</a>, a 550-acre (220 ha) area containing numerous educational, medical and cultural institutions. Case Western Reserve has a number of programs taught in conjunction with nearby institutions, including the <a>Cleveland Clinic</a>, the <a>University Hospitals of Cleveland</a>, the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran's Affairs Medical Center, <a>Cleveland Institute of Music</a>, the <a>Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center</a>, the <a>Cleveland Museum of Art</a>, the <a>Cleveland Museum of Natural History</a> and the <a>Cleveland Play House</a>.</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve was the site of the famous <a>Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment</a>, conducted in 1887 by <a>A. A. Michelson</a> of Case School of Applied Science and <a>E. W. Morley</a> of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the <a>luminiferous ether</a> and gave circumstantial evidence to substantiate Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Michelson became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Case Western Reserve University was created in 1967, when Western Reserve University and Case Institute of Technology (formerly Case School of Applied Science), institutions that had been neighbors for 81 years, formally federated.  [[File:HDow1888.jpg|thumb|right|Case alum [[Herbert Henry Dow]], founder of <a>Dow Chemical</a>]]</p>
<h3>Western Reserve University</h3>
<p>Western Reserve College was founded in 1826 in Hudson, Ohio, which, at the time, was the region's most populated area. The nearby city of Cleveland, located about 26 miles to its northwest, had only begun to grow. Western Reserve College, or &quot;Reserve&quot; as it was popularly called, was the first college in northern Ohio.</p>
<p>By 1875, a number of other schools had been established nearby, and Cleveland had emerged as clearly the dominant population and business center of the region. In 1882, with funding from <a>Amasa Stone</a>, Western Reserve College moved to Cleveland and changed its name to Western Reserve University.</p>
<h3>Case Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>[[File:Jay MacLeod at Case1.jpg|thumb|right|[[John James Richard Macleod|John J.R. Macleod]], 1923 Nobel Prize winner for discovering <a>Insulin</a> and Western Reserve University Professor of Physiology]] In 1877 Leonard Case Jr. began laying the groundwork for the Case School of Applied Science by secretly donating valuable pieces of Cleveland real estate to a trust. He asked his confidential advisor, Henry Gilbert Abbey, to administer the trust and to keep it secret until after his death. The Case School of Applied Science was issued a charter by the state of Ohio in 1882-&#x2014;just four short months after Case's death. </p>
<p>For the first four years of the school's existence, it was located in the Case family's home on Rockwell Street in downtown Cleveland. Classes were held in the family house, while the chemistry and physics laboratories were on the second floor of the barn. </p>
<p>Amasa Stone's gift to relocate Western Reserve College to Cleveland also included a provision for the purchase of land in the University Circle area, adjacent to Western Reserve University, for Case School of Applied Science. The school moved to University Circle in 1885. </p>
<p>Over time, the Case School of Applied Science grew to encompass a broader vision, adopting the name Case Institute of Technology in 1947 to reflect the institution's growing stature.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|Haydn Hall on the campus of Case Western Reserve University (Flora Stone Mather Quadrangle) in Cleveland.</a> The university is approximately five miles (eight km) east of <a>downtown Cleveland</a> in <a>University Circle</a>, a 550-acre (220 ha) area containing numerous educational, medical and cultural institutions. Case Western Reserve has a number of programs taught in conjunction with nearby institutions, including the <a>Cleveland Institute of Music</a>, the <a>Cleveland Institute of Art</a>, the <a>Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center</a>, the <a>Cleveland Museum of Art</a>, the <a>Cleveland Museum of Natural History</a>, the <a>Western Reserve Historical Society</a> and the <a>Cleveland Play House</a>.</p>
<h3>Kent H. Smith Quadrangle</h3>
<p>The Kent H. Smith Quadrangle (known to students as the Case Quad or simply as the Quad) is located south of Euclid between Adelbert Road and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.  All of the engineering buildings are located on this quad in addition to all of the natural science buildings.</p>
<h3>Flora Stone Mather Quadrangle</h3>
<p>The Flora Stone Mather Quadrangle (known to students as Mather Quad or simply Mather) is located north of Euclid Avenue between East Blvd., E. 115th Street and Juniper Road.  Usually it is more strictly defined by the area between East Blvd, Bellflower Road and Ford Road north of Euclid Avenue.  Named for the philanthropist wife of prominent industrialist <a>Samuel Mather</a> and sister-in-law of the famous statesman <a>John Hay</a>, the Flora Stone Mather Quad is home to Weatherhead School of Management, School of Law, Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences and many departments of the College of Arts and Sciences.  The Kelvin Smith Library (Case Western Reserve's main library) and the Thwing Student Center are also located on Mather Quad.</p>
<h3>North Residential Village</h3>
<p>Situated on the northeast end of campus, the North Residential Village (NRV) is home to all Case's freshman who reside on campus.  Constructed in the 1960s, the NRV consists of 12 4 floor buildings, an 11 floor &quot;tower&quot;, a dining hall, and a building containing the NRV area office and rehearsal space for Case's music department.</p>
<h4>Village at 115</h4>
<p>Located along E. 115th Street, this is the newest addition to Case's residential housing units which opened in the fall of 2005. Currently, only upper-class members are allowed to reside. The Village (as it is referred to by students) consists of 7 houses that surround the football field and track. Village housing is apartment style, with apartments that house 1-9 people (excluding 8 people apartments). The apartments are fully furnished. The Village is also LEED certified. Houses 1-4 &amp; 6-7 are certified silver while house 5 is certified gold.</p>
<h3>South Residential Village</h3>
<p>Located between Murray Hill, Cedar, Edgehill and Overlook roads, the South Residential Village (SRV) is home to most of Case Western Reserve's sophomore class.  SRV is divided into two sections:  Murray Hill Complex and Carlton Road Complex (known to students as bottom of the hill and top of the hill, respectively, due to the hill separating the two complexes).  Carlton Road Complex includes three sophomore-only dormitories and several Greek life houses.  Murray Hill Complex includes two sophomore only buildings, one sophomore and upperclassmen building, one upperclassmen-only building, several Greek houses and the SRV dining hall.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>There are two main transportation options for students: For on- and near-campus transportation, Case Western Reserve University has a fleet of shuttle buses known as &quot;<a>Greenies</a>&quot;, though they are currently painted blue.  For longer trips, students may use the <a>Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority</a> (RTA) bus and rail system. Each undergraduate student receives an unlimited RTA pass, which is paid for via a mandatory $25 fee per semester.</p>
<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>Case Western Reserve University does not manage its parking lots (<a>University Circle Incorporated</a> manages the lots), but students, faculty and staff still purchase permits from the university. The rates vary between approximately $30 and $120 per month.</p>
<p>The university owns parking garages, one at the Village at 115 and the other near the Veale Athletic Center. Permits for these two lots are purchased from the university, and cost about $600 per year, excluding the summer.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>In 2009 Case Western's undergraduate program was ranked 41st among 262 national universities by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. It is also ranked at 28th for Best Value. The School of Medicine ranked 20th in research. The University is associated with <a>16 Nobel Laureates</a>.

<h3>Naming controversy</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|The controversial &quot;Case&quot; logo</a> In 2003, the university unveiled a new logo and branding campaign that emphasized the &quot;Case&quot; portion of its name. In 2006, interim university president Gregory Eastwood convened a task group to study reactions to the campaign. The panel's report indicated that it had gone so poorly that &quot;there appear to be serious concerns now about the university's ability to recruit and maintain high-quality faculty, fund-raising and leadership.&quot; Also, the logo was derided among the university's community and alumni and throughout northeastern Ohio; critics said it looked like &quot;a fat man with a surfboard.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2007, the university's board of trustees approved a shift back to giving equal weight to &quot;Case&quot; and &quot;Western Reserve&quot;. A new logo was chosen and implementation began July 1. In an open letter to the university community, interim president Eastwood admitted that &quot;the university had misplaced its own history and traditions.&quot;</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>Case Western Reserve University's endowment ranks at No. 30 among all U.S. colleges and universities. The university comes in at No. 18 for largest endowment growth over the past 20 years, experiencing an increase of 393 percent in that time (See: <a>List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment</a>).</p>
<h3>Student body</h3>
<p>, the university had 4,228 undergraduate students and 5,510 graduate and professional students. The undergraduate student body hails from all 50 states and 82 countries.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>[[File:Subir Gokarn.JPG&#x200e;|thumb|right| [[Subir Gokarn]] (PhD alumnus), current Deputy Governor of <a>Reserve Bank of India</a> (equivalent of U.S. <a>Federal Reserve</a>)]] [[File:Allen Memorial Medical Library Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Allen Memorial Medical Library]]]] Following is a partial list of major contributions made by faculty, staff and students at Case Western Reserve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Case Western Reserve was the site of the famous <a>Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment</a>, conducted in 1887 by <a>Albert Abraham Michelson</a> of Case Institute of Technology and <a>E. W. Morley</a> of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the <a>ether</a> and gave circumstantial evidence to substantiate <a>Einstein's</a> <a>special theory of relativity</a> (Profs. Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley, 1887).</li>
  <li>Albert Abraham Michelson, who became the first American to win a <a>Nobel Prize</a> in science, taught at Case Institute of Technology. He won the prize in physics in 1907.</li>
  <li>Discovered the atomic weight of oxygen, the basis for calculating the weights of all other elements (Prof. Morley, 1895).</li>
  <li>Performed the first full <a>X-ray</a> of the human body&#x2014;on himself (Prof. Dayton C. Miller, 1896).</li>
  <li>Performed the first modern <a>blood transfusion</a> using a coupling device to connect blood vessels (<a>Dr. George W. Crile</a>, 1905).</li>
  <li>Pioneered chlorination of drinking water to eradicate the source of <a>typhoid</a> bacilli (Dr. Roger G. Perkins, 1912).</li>
  <li>Developed simulated <a>infant formula</a> (Dr. Henry J. Gerstenberger,1915).</li>
  <li>Pioneered surgical treatment of <a>coronary artery disease</a> (Dr. Claude S. Beck, 1935).</li>
  <li>Developed the first <a>heart-lung machine</a> to be used during open heart surgery (Dr. Frederick S. Cross, 1950s).</li>
  <li>Performed the first successful lifesaving <a>defibrillation</a> of the human heart (Dr. Beck, 1947) and developed the method of <a>cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a> (CPR) (Dr. Beck, 1952).</li>
  <li>Invented the intermittent <a>windshield wiper</a> used in most automobiles today (Dr. Kearns, 1964)</li>
  <li>Detected for the first-time <a>neutrino</a>s created by <a>cosmic ray</a> collisions with the Earth's atmosphere and developed innovative <a>particle detector</a>s (<a>Prof. Frederick Reines</a>, 1965). Case Western Reserve had selected Prof. Reines as chair of the physics department based on Reines's work in first detecting neutrinos emitted from a <a>nuclear reactor</a>&#x2014;work for which Reines in 1995 shared the <a>Nobel Prize</a>.</li>
  <li>Pioneered the materials science of polymers with the creation of first comprehensive polymer science and engineering department at a major U.S. university (<a>Eric Baer</a>, 1967).</li>
  <li>Developed a test for infants to identify mental retardation within one year of birth (Prof. Joseph F. Fagan, 1987).</li>
  <li>Created the first artificial human chromosomes, opening the door to more detailed study of human genetics and potentially offering a new approach to gene therapy. (Prof. Huntington F. Willard of the School of Medicine and University Hospitals of Cleveland, in collaboration with colleagues at Athersys, Inc., 1997).</li>
  <li>Pioneered <a>Local Loop Unbundling</a> in Africa. He also chaired the Local Loop Unbundling Committee on behalf of the South African Government (Prof. <a>Tshilidzi Marwala</a>).</li>
  <li>Developed robots such as <a>Whegs</a> which mimic the motion of cockroaches and other crawling insects (Case Biorobotics Lab).</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2007, a team from Case Western Reserve participated in the <a>DARPA Urban Challenge</a> with a robotic car named DEXTER. Team Case placed as one of 36 semi-finalists.  DEXTER was the only car in the race without any seating for humans, and the only one to be built from the ground up as a robot car.</p>
<p>Today, the university operates several facilities off campus for scientific research. One notable example of this is the <a>Warner and Swasey Observatory</a> at <a>Kitt Peak National Observatory</a> in <a>Arizona</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Unless students are living with a relative within 40 miles of the university, Case Western Reserve University requires first- and second-year students to live in on-campus housing.  <a>Meal plan</a> participation is also mandatory for first- and second-year students, with some exceptions made for religious and medical reasons.  New housing for underclassmen, along with a &quot;Greek village,&quot; bringing all the college's fraternities and sororities together with the other undergraduates, is slated to be constructed in the future.</p>
<p>[[File:Severance-Hall-Cleveland.JPG|left|thumb|287px|[[Severance Hall]] is adjacent to campus, and houses the <a>Cleveland Orchestra</a>.  The University Circle neighborhood is home to many of Cleveland's cultural institutions.]]</p>
<p>The residence halls are divided into two areas, one featuring suite-style rooms for second-year students and upperclassmen and the other featuring double and single rooms for first-year students. Both have <a>gigabit ethernet</a> network access and the wired network is one of the fastest that exists. A wireless campus network is also available anywhere on campus, also ranked one of the fastest by <a>Intel</a> in 2005.  Buildings are organized into &quot;colleges,&quot; grouping together students of similar ages and creating a sense of ownership and hall pride.  New housing, known as the Village at 115, was opened in fall 2005 for upperclassmen, which features one- to nine-person, &quot;apartment-style&quot; <a>residence halls</a> that come with <a>air conditioning</a>, full <a>kitchen</a> area and full-sized <a>bed</a>s.</p>
<p>Residence Life at Case Western Reserve University has a recent history of being liberal in its policies, including allowing <a>co-ed</a> suites (an option offered to non-freshman students, when requested and agreed upon by all occupants of a suite) and some co-ed floors for freshmen, as well as a three-day guest policy. Pets are allowed except for dogs, cats, ferrets and a few other small mammals, but requests are granted discussion.</p>
<p>Graduate students are not offered housing.</p>
<p>A campus shuttle runs to <a>Coventry Village</a>, a shopping district in neighboring Cleveland Heights. Cleveland's <a>Little Italy</a> is within walking distance. Legacy Village, Severance Center and <a>Shaker Square</a> shopping centers are all within driving distance or accessible by RTA.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p><a>WRUW-FM</a> is the campus radio station of Case Western Reserve University. Its motto &quot;More Music, Fewer Hits&quot; can be seen adorning the rear bumpers of many vehicles in the area. WRUW broadcasts at a power of 15,000 watts and covers most of Northeast Ohio 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>WRUW is staffed by Case Western Reserve students and community volunteers. The station's format can be classified as non-commercial &quot;variety.&quot;</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve is also home to several performing ensembles, including <a>a cappella</a> groups such as the <a>Case Men's Glee Club</a>, <a>Case Women's Glee Club</a>, Case in Point, Speakeasy, Dhamakapella, Bigger Than A Breadbox, and Solstice. Other ensembles include the Case/University Circle Symphony Orchestra, Camerata Chamber Orchestra, Case/CIM Baroque Orchestra, Concert Choir, Early Music Singers, Jazz Ensemble 1 and 2, Marching Spartans, Percussion Ensemble, Symphonic Winds, University Singers, Collegium Musicum, New Music Ensemble, Wind Ensemble and Chamber Music.</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve has two main rehearsal spaces for performing arts music majors and school ensembles.  Hadyn Hall contains practice rooms with Steinway pianos, along with the department offices. Denison Hall serves as a rehearsal, practice, and teaching space for the music students and school ensembles, and is attached to Wade Commons.  The <a>Cleveland Youth Wind Symphony</a> also rehearses in Denison Hall.  Music majors take lessons at the <a>Cleveland Institute of Music</a>.</p>
<p>For performances, all students, ensembles, and a cappella groups use Harkness Chapel.  The bands and orchestra also perform at <a>Severance Hall</a> (the on-campus home of the <a>Cleveland Orchestra</a>) and <a>CIM</a>'s Kulas Hall.</p>
<h3>Computing</h3>
<p>Case Western Reserve had the first <a>ABET</a>-accredited program in <a>computer engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In 1968, the university formed a private company, Chi Corporation, to provide computer time to both it and other customers. Initially this was on a <a>Univac 1108</a> (replacing the preceding <a>UNIVAC 1107</a>), 36 bit, <a>one's complement</a> machine. The company was sold in 1977 to Robert G. Benson in Beachwood, Ohio.</p>
<p>Project Logos, under ARPA contract, was begun within the department on a DEC System-10 (later converted to <a>TENEX</a> (<a>BBN</a>) in conjunction with connection to the <a>ARPANET</a>) to develop a computer-aided computer design system. This system consisted in a distributed, networked, graphics environment, a control and data flow designer and logic (both hardware and software) analyzer. Graphics and animation became another departmental focus with the acquisition of an <a>Evans &amp; Sutherland</a> LDS-1, which was hosted by the DEC System-10, and later with the acquisition of the stand alone LDS-2.</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve was one of the earliest universities to be connected to the <a>ARPANET</a>, predecessor to the <a>Internet</a>. ARPANET went online in 1969; Case Western Reserve was connected in January, 1971.  Case Western Reserve graduate Ken Biba published the <a>Biba Integrity Model</a> in 1977 and served on the ARPA Working Group that developed the <a>Transmission Control Protocol</a> (TCP) used on the Internet.  </p>
<p>Case Western Reserve pioneered the early <a>Free-net</a> computer systems, creating the first Free-net, The Cleveland Free-Net, as well as writing the software that drove a majority of those systems, known as FreePort. The Cleveland Free-Net was shut down in late 1999, as it had become obsolete.</p>
<p>It was the first university to have an all-fiber-optic network, in 1989.</p>
<p>At the inaugural meeting in October, 1996, Case Western Reserve was one of the 34 charter university members of <a>Internet2</a>.</p>
<p>The university was ranked No. 1 in Yahoo Internet Life's 1999 Most Wired College list. There was a perception that this award was obtained through partially false or inaccurate information submitted for the survey, and the university did not appear at all on the 2000 Most Wired College list (which included 100 institutions); the numbers reported were much lower than those which had been submitted by Ray Neff in 1999. The university had previously placed No. 13 in the 1997 poll.</pre>
<p>In August 2003, Case Western Reserve joined the <a>Internet Streaming Media Alliance</a>, then one of only two university members.</p>
<p>In September 2003, Case Western Reserve opened 1,230 public wireless access points on the Case Western Reserve campus and University Circle.</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve was one of the founding members of <a>OneCleveland</a>, formed in October 2003. OneCleveland is an &quot;ultra broadband&quot; (gigabit speed) fiber optic network. This network is for the use of organizations in education, research, government, healthcare, arts, culture, and the nonprofit sector in Greater Cleveland.</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve is also known for its Virtual Worlds gaming computer lab, which opened in 2005. The lab has a large network of <a>Alienware</a> PCs equipped with game development software such as the <a>Torque Game Engine</a> and <a>Maya</a> 3D modeling software. Additionally, it contains a number of specialized advanced computing rooms including a medical simulation room, a <a>MIDI</a> instrument music room, a 3D projection &quot;immersion room&quot;, a <a>virtual reality</a> research room, and console room, which features video game systems such as <a>Xbox 360</a>, <a>PlayStation 3</a>, and <a>Wii</a>.  This laboratory can be used by any student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department, and is heavily used for the Game Development (EECS 290) course.</p>
<p>Case Western's Internet Technology Service also runs a High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) utilizing 976 processors over 133 computer nodes interconnected with gigabit fiberoptic ethernet.  The HPCC is available for research utilizing a wide array of commercial and custom scientific software packages and computer languages including: Matlab, Mathematica, Ansys CFX Fluent and ICEM, Schr&#x00f6;dinger, LAMMPS, Gaussian, Neuron, Qhull, Sundials, Charmm/qchem, Rosetta, Gromacs, NAMD, C, C++, Fortran.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p><a>First-year students</a> are grouped into one of three <a>residential college</a>s that are overseen by first-year coordinators. The Mistletoe, Juniper, and Magnolia residential colleges were established when the &quot;First Year Experience&quot; system was introduced, and Cedar was created in the fall of 2005 to accommodate a large influx of new students.  In the fall of 2007, Magnolia was integrated into Mistletoe. The areas of focus for each college &ndash; Cedar: visual and performing arts; Mistletoe: service leadership; and Juniper: multiculturalism &ndash; remain the same.</p>
<p>The residential colleges plan events together and are run by college councils that take student input and use it to plan social and community service-oriented activities.</p>
<h3>Greek Life</h3>
<p>Nearly one-third of the campus undergraduates are in a <a>fraternity or sorority</a>. There are seven sororities and 15 fraternities currently on campus. Greek organizations are governed by an <a>Interfraternity Council</a> and <a>Panhellenic Council</a>. Recently semi-recognition has been given to a colony of Omega Tau Zeta. During the Fall of 2006, Sigma Alpha Epsilon was removed from the Case Western Reserve University campus due to legal issues. In the Spring of 2007, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a> returned to the Case Western Reserve University Greek life. With the fall 2007 semester, <a>Sigma Alpha Mu</a> returned to Case Western Reserve (currently only as a colony) and a new sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, joined the Greek community.  During the 2008-2009 school year, fraternities and sororities at Case collectively raised over $43,000 for philanthropy.  In September 2010, the Delta Chi Fraternity will join the Greek community.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>The <a>Hudson Relays</a> is an annual tradition at Case Western Reserve University that occurs on the last weekend before finals every spring semester. It is a relay race between teams drawn from each class year. The race is a distance of . Originally, the race was run from Hudson, Ohio, the original site of Western Reserve University, to the present location of the school in University Circle. Since the mid-1980s, the race has been run entirely in the University Circle area. University tradition is that if a class wins the relay for each of its four years, the team will be rewarded with a champagne and steak dinner with the president of the university. The most recent class to achieve this was the class of 2006. The winning class for each year is carved on a boulder located behind <a>Adelbert Hall</a>.</p>
<p>Springfest is a day-long concert and student group festival which occurs later the same day of Hudson Relays. The Springfest Planning Committee brings in several bands and a beer garden, student groups set up booths to entertain the student body, and various inflatable carnival-style attractions are brought in to add to the festive atmosphere. Occasionally, due to adverse weather conditions, the festival must be moved indoors, usually to Thwing Center or Adelbert Gym.</p>
<p>Halloween at the Farm is a tradition established in the fall of 2002. Halloween at the Farm takes place at the Squire Valleevue Farm in <a>Hunting Valley, Ohio</a>. Students, their families, and faculty are invited to enjoy games, a bonfire, an open air concert and hay rides. Organized by the members of the Class Officer Collective, HATF is one of the biggest events of the year. In the fall of 2009 the event was moved to be on the main campus and was re-named &quot;Halloween at Home&quot; with what appeared to be far fewer activities and attendees, though it could have been due to poor weather.</p>
<p>Since 1974, the <a>Film Society</a> of Case Western Reserve University has held a science fiction marathon. The film festival, the oldest of its type, boasts more than 34 hours of non-stop movies, cartoons, trailers, and shorts spanning many decades and sub-genres.</p>
