<p>The <strong>National Hispanic University (NHU) </strong> is a small, <a>private</a> university located in East <a>San Jose, California</a>. The university is <a>nonsectarian</a> and <a>coeducation</a>al with 700 undergraduate students.  Chartered by the state of California and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, it is the foremost Hispanic-focused university in the United States.</p>
<p>The mission of the school is to provide a high-quality liberal education modeled in a more intimate, <em>familia</em>-like multicultural educational environment. The student body is predominantly female, Hispanic, and adult, making it demographically different from most institutions of higher education. The school seeks to attract a diverse range of students across racial and gender lines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>NHU was founded in 1981 in <a>Oakland, California</a>, to address the needs of Hispanic men and women. Founder Dr. Roberto Cruz had studied the disproportionately large impact <a>historically black colleges and universities</a> had in generating both undergraduate and <a>professional degree</a> graduates within the <a>Black community</a>. Dr. Cruz's vision was to have similarly positive impact on the Hispanic community in the United States. In 1990, the university opened a San Jose campus and moved to a larger facility in Oakland. In 1994, NHU closed both campuses and moved to a new campus in San Jose. </p>
<p>In 2001, the school sponsored the <a>Latino College Preparatory Academy</a> (LCPA), a charter high school adjacent to the NHU campus. A large majority of (LCPA) students matriculate at NHU.</p>
<p>In 2010, NHU became a member of the <a>Laureate International Universities</a> network. Laureate International Universities is a global network of more than 50 accredited campus-based and online universities offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs to 550,000 students around the world. Laureate International Universities students are part of an international, academic community that spans 21 countries and more than 100 campuses throughout North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Laureate International Universities offer more than 130 career-focused, undergraduate, master&#x2019;s and doctoral degree programs in fields including engineering, education, business, medicine, law, architecture, health sciences, hospitality, culinary arts, and information technology.</p>
