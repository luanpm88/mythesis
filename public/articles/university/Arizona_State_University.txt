<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:ASU Old Main.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Old Main (Arizona State University)|Old Main]]]]  Originally named the <a>Tempe Normal School</a>, the institution was founded on March 12, 1885 after John Samuel Armstrong first introduced House Bill 164, &quot;An Act to Establish a <a>Normal school</a> in the <a>Territory of Arizona</a> to the <a>13th Legislative Assembly</a> of the <a>Arizona Territory</a>. Instruction was instituted on February 8, 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer. Land for the school was donated by <a>Tempe</a> residents George and Martha Wilson, allowing 33 students to meet in a single room.&lt;ref&gt;<a>More ASU History</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the school's name was changed from <a>Tempe Normal School</a> to the Normal School of Arizona. Before becoming a college, the <a>Normal School</a> enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities.</p>
<p>Under the 30 year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubbery brought to the campus. He also implemented the planting of <a>Palm Walk</a>, now one of the feature landmarks of the school. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having the honor of being declared a nationally recognized arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;<a>The Arboretum at Arizona State University</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>During the <a>Great Depression</a>, Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Archives &amp; Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Although enrollment increased by almost 100% during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;<a>Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930-1933</a>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>

<h3>Gammage years</h3>
<p>In 1933, <a>Grady Gammage</a>, then president of Arizona State Teachers College at <a>Flagstaff</a>, became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor, Dr. Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs, and the renaming of the Arizona State College to Arizona State University in 1958.</p>
<h3>Years of growth and stature</h3>
<p>During the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. <a>G. Homer Durham</a>, Arizona State University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> and other doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;<a>ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The next three presidents&#x2014;Harry K. Newburn, 1969&#x2013;71, John W. Schwada, 1971&#x2013;81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981&#x2013;89&#x2014;and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the <a>West Campus</a>, and rising enrollment.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew to serve the Valley of the Sun through the creation of the <a>Polytechnic campus</a> and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in <a>undergraduate education</a>, research, and economic development underscored the university's significant gains in each of these areas over his 12-year tenure. Part of Dr. Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign. Through private donations, primarily from the local community, more than $500 million was invested in targeted areas that significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of the <a>Barrett Honors College</a>, the <a>Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts</a>, and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management at the Polytechnic campus; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;<a>ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>The Crow Era</h3>
<p>On July 1, 2002, <a>Michael Crow</a> became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;&#x2014;one that would be open and inclusive. As the only <a>research university</a> serving the metropolitan Phoenix area (and one of only two in Arizona), Crow stated that ASU is in a unique position to evolve together with the city into one of the great intellectual institutions in the world. Further, Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One University in Many Places&quot; by merging ASU's several campuses into a single institution, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation.</p>
<p>Under Crow's leadership, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU embarked on an aggressive years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the completion of the <a>Biodesign Institute</a> and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three <a>Nobel Laureates</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Nobel Prize Winners</a> ASU News&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ASU's <a>Downtown Phoenix</a> campus was vastly expanded. Several of the University's colleges and schools were relocated to the downtown campus, and new programs, such as a biomedical collaboration with the <a>University of Arizona</a> were established in downtown Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.asu.edu/news/research/biomed_pressconf_082704.htm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>economic downturn</a> that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Budget Cuts Proposal</a> Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these cuts, ASU underwent several rounds of reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Academic Reorganization</a>&lt;/ref&gt; combining academic departments, consolidating colleges and schools, and reducing university staff and administrators.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p></p>
<p>ASU's colleges, schools, and departments are spread across four campuses: the <a>Tempe campus</a> in <a>Tempe, Arizona</a>, the <a>West campus</a> in northwest <a>Phoenix</a>, the <a>Polytechnic campus</a> located in eastern Mesa, and the <a>Downtown Phoenix campus</a> in <a>downtown Phoenix</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>ASU Campuses</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Each campus hosts a unique set of colleges and schools, offering both <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> programs.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvjbbz&quot;&gt;<a>One University in Many Places</a> Explanation of the ASU campus organization&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the physical campuses, ASU includes a fifth &quot;virtual campus&quot; for <a>online</a> and extended education.</p>

<h3>Colleges @ ASU</h3>
<p>In response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona, ASU is developing a number of small, undergraduate-only college campuses throughout Arizona. These campuses will be teaching-focused, and will provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors. The first two of these campuses are being planned for <a>Payson, Arizona</a> and <a>Lake Havasu City, Arizona</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Colleges @ ASU in Payson</a> <a>Arizona Republic</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Student Government and Residence Hall Association</h3>
<p>Associated Students of Arizona State University (ASASU) is the <a>student government</a> at Arizona State University.&lt;ref&gt;<a>ASASU Website</a>&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate &amp; Professional Student Association (GPSA). Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.</p>
<p>The <a>Residence Hall Association</a> (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently of each other. The purpose of RHA is to enhance the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual hall councils. In 2008, the RHA of ASU-Tempe was voted &quot;Best School of the Year&quot; out of over 400 higher education institutions.</p>
