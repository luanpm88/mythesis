<p> <strong>Oregon State University</strong> (<strong>OSU</strong>) is a <a>coeducation</a>al, <a>public</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Corvallis</a>, <a>Oregon</a>, <a>United States</a>. The university offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees and a multitude of research opportunities. There are over 200 <a>academic degree</a> programs offered through the university. OSU's programs in <a>nuclear engineering</a>, <a>ecology</a>, <a>forestry</a>, <a>public health</a>, <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>zoology</a>, <a>oceanography</a>, <a>food science</a> and <a>pharmacy</a> are recognized nationally as top tier programs.  In recent years, OSU's <a>liberal arts</a> programs have also grown significantly.  Over 200,000 people have attended OSU since its founding. The <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classifies Oregon State University as a &quot;very high research activity&quot; university.</p>
<p>Oregon State is one of the 73 <a>land-grant</a> universities of the United States. The school is also recognized as a <a>sea-grant</a>, <a>space-grant</a> and <a>sun-grant</a> institution, making it one of only two US institutions to retain all four designations and the only public university to do so (<a>Cornell</a> is the only other with similar designations). The school offered its first college-level curriculum in 1865, under the administration of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>.</p>
<p>On August 22, 1868, official Articles of Incorporation were filed for Corvallis College. October 27, 1868, is known as OSU Charter Day, the day that the <a>Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> designated Corvallis College as the Agricultural College of the state of Oregon and the recipient of <a>Land Grant</a> fund income. As part of this designation, the college was required to comply with the requirements set forth in the <a>First Morrill Act</a>. The name was changed to <strong>Corvallis State Agricultural College</strong> and was then authorized to grant the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a>Bachelor of Science</a>, and <a>Master of Arts</a> degrees. The first graduating class was in 1870, granting <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees.</p>
<h3>Oregon Agricultural College</h3>
<p>In 1890 the college became known as <strong>Oregon Agricultural College (OAC)</strong>. Orange was adopted as the school color, with black as the background. The <a>Olmsted Brothers</a> developed the first Campus Master Plan in 1909, emphasizing trees and an architectural harmony showcasing basic classical forms in brick. The current campus design generally follows this original plan and is laid on a grid of wide, tree-lined streets. Well-partitioned buildings accent open lawns along the main passages and are mostly surrounded by clusters of tall trees. The overall scheme gives it a quaint, early American institutional feel common to campuses found in the Midwest or Southern U.S. </p>
<p>The Division of College Extension was organized in 1911 with Ralph Dorn Hetzel as director and, in 1912, the first off-campus faculty were placed in Marion and Wallowa counties. The <a>Army</a> <a>ROTC</a> became active in 1917, replacing the original Cadet Corps formed by students studying <a>Military Science</a>. In 1919, OAC began a horticultural products processing program, the first of its kind in the United States. Accreditation was granted in 1924 by the <a>Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Irish Bend Covered Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irish Bend Covered Bridge]] - The west side of campus is dedicated, primarily, to agricultural research. It is also home to this historic landmark.]]</p>
<h3>Oregon State</h3>
<p>1927 marked yet another name change, this time to Oregon State Agricultural College. The Oregon Unification Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly in 1929 placed the school under the oversight of the newly formed <a>Oregon State Board of Higher Education</a>. Doctoral education was first provided in 1935 with the conferral of four <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> degrees. This year also saw the creation of the first summer session. The growing diversity in degree programs offered led to another name change in 1937, when the college became <strong>Oregon State College</strong>.</p>
<p>The university's current title, <strong>Oregon State University,</strong> was adopted on March 6, 1961 by a legislative act signed into law by Governor <a>Mark Hatfield</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, Scott Reed was named the Vice Provost for Outreach and Engagement as OSU Extension Service and <a>OSU Extended Campus</a> were aligned under this new division.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Research has played a central role in the university's overall operations for much of its history. Most of OSU's research continues at the Corvallis campus, but an increasing number of endeavors are underway at various locations throughout the state and abroad. Current research facilities, beyond the campus, include the Seafood Laboratory in <a>Astoria</a> and the Food Innovation Laboratory in <a>Portland</a>. The university's college of oceanic and atmospheric sciences operates several state-of-the-art laboratories, including the <a>Hatfield Marine Science Center</a> and two oceanographic research vessels out of <a>Newport</a>. OSU also manages nearly  of forest land, which includes the McDonald-Dunn Research Forest.</p>
<p>The 2005 <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> recognized Oregon State as a, &quot;Comprehensive Doctoral with Medical/Veterinary&quot; university. This is one of only three such universities in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a> to be classified in this category. In 2006, Carnegie also recognized the university as having &quot;Very High Research Activity,&quot; which makes OSU the only university in Oregon to attain these combined classifications.</p>
<p>The <a>National Sea Grant College Program</a> was founded in the 1960s. OSU is one of the original four Sea Grant Colleges selected in 1971.</p>
<p>In 1967 the <a>Radiation Center</a> was constructed at the edge of campus, housing a 1.1 <a>MW</a> <a>TRIGA</a> Mark II Research <a>Reactor</a>. The reactor is equipped to utilize <a>Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)</a> for fuel. Rankings published by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> in 2008 placed Oregon State eighth in the nation in graduate <a>nuclear engineering</a>.</p>
<p>OSU was one of the early members of the federal <a>Space Grant</a> program. Designated in 1991, the additional grant program made Oregon State one of only 13 schools in the <a>United States</a> to serve as a combined <a>Land Grant</a>, <a>Sea Grant</a>, and <a>Space Grant</a> university. Most recently, OSU was designated as a federal <a>Sun Grant</a> institution. The designation, made in 2003, now makes Oregon State one of only two such universities (the other being <a>Cornell University</a>), and the only public institution with all four designations.</p>
<p>In 1999 OSU finished a $40 million remodel to the campus library. Known as the '<a>Valley Library</a>', the totally remodeled building was selected by <em><a>The Library Journal</a></em> as their 1999 Library of the Year, the first academic library so named.</p>
<p>The <a>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</a> funds two research centers at Oregon State University. The Environmental Health Sciences Center has been funded continually since 1969 and the Superfund Research Center is a newer center that started funding in 2009.</p>
<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Students at Oregon State University have new opportunities to learn about and actively participate in entrepreneurial endeavors. OSU is the first public university to dedicate an entire building, Weatherford Hall, to a program focused on fostering student-run businesses with mentoring and related courses.</p>
<p>Located in the middle of campus, Weatherford Hall is one of the school's original dormitory buildings. The building is now home to the <a>Austin Entrepreneurship Program</a> (AEP TICK). The program is designed to incubate a multitude of student businesses participating as members of the <a>OSU Society of Entrepreneurs</a>.</p>
<h3>Rankings and recognition</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Weatherford Hall in 2009</a> OSU has more majors, minors and special programs than any other university or college in Oregon. [[Image:The Valley Library OSU.png|thumb|right|[[The Valley Library]]]] Other recent recognitions include a 2007 ranking by <a>STACK magazine</a>, in which OSU was selected as one of the nation's top 50 universities in &quot;academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance.&quot; The school ranked 29th overall, making it one of only two Northwest schools in the top 30 and the only university from the state to receive a ranking.</p>
<p>As a top tier forestry school, OSU is widely considered the nation's leader in the subject. Of the 53 forestry programs at North American universities; <a>Oregon State University College of Forestry</a> was ranked first by a 2006 survey, &quot;&#x2026;in the total number of professional publications, first in the number of 'citations' to those publications, and is perceived by academic colleagues as the leading forestry program in North America.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 2011 edition of the U.S. News National University rankings, Oregon State is listed at 139.  The 2010 edition of the ARWU ranks Oregon State in the 101-150 category.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Campus from airplane</a> <a>right|thumb|The Memorial Union</a> The 400-acre (1.62&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) main campus is located in Corvallis, in the <a>Willamette Valley</a>. Although its surroundings are rural, the city is rapidly becoming more metropolitan and has seen recent periods of infrastructural and economic growth. This recent expansion is helping to provide the city with one of the highest standards of living in the state. Corvallis, a city of 53,000 permanent residents, was recognized in 1996 as one of the most livable cities in America.</p>
<p>Corvallis was most recently ranked as the 5th-smartest university town in the United States. The 2008 ranking, by <a>Forbes.com</a>, was based on the percent of educational degrees residents living in America's cities have earned. Researchers found 47.65% of Corvallis residents hold a bachelor's degree or higher, 5.62% achieved a Ph.D while 1.95% have earned other educational degrees. Over 93% of the city's residents have graduated from high school, which is an unusually high statistic for any city nationwide. In 1994 OSU was also rated the safest campus in the <a>Pac-10</a> in a study of universities.</p>
<h4>Historic district</h4>
<p>In September 2008, the Oregon State University campus was designated the <strong>Oregon State University Historic District</strong> by the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP).&lt;!--Note:Link likely to go dead, check SHPO database. I also saved a copy. Katr67 9-16-2008--&gt; It is the only college or university campus in Oregon to have a <a>historic district</a> designation. The effort to have the <a>John Charles Olmsted</a>-designed campus listed on the NRHP took two years.  Some of the more prominent athletes include <a>Boston Red Sox</a> player and <a>2007 World Series</a> champion <a>Jacoby Ellsbury</a>; NFL <a>Pro Bowl</a>ers <a>Chad Ocho Cinco</a>, <a>T. J. Houshmandzadeh</a>, <a>Steven Jackson</a> and <a>Derek Anderson</a>; <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a>Terry Baker</a>; <a>Houston Rockets</a> player <a>Brent Barry</a>; former NBA player &quot;Iron Man&quot; <a>A. C. Green</a>; and 9-time NBA All-Star <a>Gary Payton</a>. OSU alumni have earned more than 15 Olympic medals, including <a>Fosbury Flop</a> creator <a>Dick Fosbury</a>; first American woman to high jump over 6' <a>Joni Huntley</a>; and undefeated amateur wrestler <a>Robin Reed</a>.</p>
<p>Other notable alumni include <a>NASA</a> astronauts <a>William Oefelein</a> and <a>Donald Pettit</a>, <a>Playboy</a> <a>Playmates</a> of The Year <a>Jodi Ann Paterson</a> and <a>Sara Jean Underwood</a>, and Turkish billionaire <a>H&#x00fc;sn&#x00fc; &#x00d6;zye&#x011f;in</a>.</p>
<h3>Faculty and staff</h3>
<p> OSU has several notable faculty members, including <a>entomology</a> professor <a>George Poinar, Jr.</a>, whose work extracting DNA from insects fossilized in amber was the inspiration for the novel and film <em><a>Jurassic Park</a></em>.</p>
<p>OSU baseball coach <a>Pat Casey</a> was named Coach of the Year by several publications in both 2006 and 2007 when he led the baseball team to back-to-back national championships, and former OSU basketball coaches <a>Slats Gill</a> and <a>Ralph Miller</a> are both members of the <a>Basketball Hall of Fame</a>. Current OSU head basketball coach <a>Craig Robinson</a> is the brother-in-law of President <a>Barack Obama</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Dixon Recreation Center</a> The city that Oregon State University calls home is the tenth largest city in the state. Still, <a>Corvallis</a> is a relatively small community and many of the local events have a strong connection to the university. Oregon State has over 300 active student organizations and groups, the most of any university in the <a>Oregon University System</a>. The campus is located only a few hours driving distance from any number of outdoor recreation opportunities. Several federal and state natural forests and parks make up popular student destinations. These include the <a>Cascade Range</a>, a rugged coastline, several large forests, a desert, and many rivers. <a>Portland</a>, Oregon's largest city, is  north of the campus.</p>
<p>From 1930 until 1968, Oregon State University was home to the Gamma chapter of <a>Phrateres</a>, a philanthropic-social organization for female college students.  Gamma was the third chapter of the organization, which eventually had over 20 chapters in <a>Canada</a> and the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of older students at Oregon State University live off-campus, but on-campus housing is available and typically home to incoming freshmen. There are 13 residence halls (<a>dormitories</a>) on campus, which are organized into individual Hall Councils. Residents make-up the membership and each council holds their own elections to select management over the hall government. All of the councils are managed by the Residence Hall Association (RHA).</p>
<p><a>The LaSells Stewart Center</a> is the conference and performing arts center for the campus. Many famous speakers have graced the stage of the campus' main auditorium, <a>Austin Auditorium</a>, while the <a>Corvallis-OSU Symphony</a> plays there frequently. The OSU Office of Conferences and Special Events is located within the auditorium.</p>
<p>The University is host to a radio station, <a>KBVR 88.7 FM</a>, a television station, <a>KBVR TV 26</a>, an award-winning student newspaper, <em><a>The Daily Barometer</a></em>, an alternative newspaper, the <em><a>OSU Liberty</a></em>.</p>
<p>Two Oregon State students are members of the <a>Oregon Student Association</a> Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are: <em>Oregon State Fight Song.</em></p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|200px|Reser Stadium</a> <a>thumb|right|200px|Oregon State University Benny Beaver Mascot</a> In a 2008 national ranking based on academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance, Oregon State was chosen as one of the &quot;premier&quot; universities in America. This ranking, performed by <a>Stack Magazine</a>, places Oregon State 29th in the nation's &quot;<a>Elite 50</a>&quot; universities and uncontested within the state.</p>
<p>The history of Oregon State athletics dates back to 1893, when &quot;Jimmie the <a>Coyote</a>&quot; was chosen as the college's mascot. This was replaced by the <a>beaver</a> in 1910 (the beaver remains the school's mascot today). In 1915, the college became one of the four charter members of the <a>Pacific Coast (Athletic) Conference</a>.</p>
<p><a>Football</a> is played in <a>Reser Stadium</a>. The current costumed mascot <a>Benny the Beaver</a> made his first appearance in 1952. The next year, 1953, saw the opening of the football facility, Parker Stadium (now named <a>Reser Stadium</a>). The Raising Reser campaign expanded the stadium from 35,000 seats to 46,200 throughout 2006&#x2014;2007. You can watch a <a>time lapse webcam</a> of the expansion.</p>
<p>1962 saw OSU's (and the west coast's) first <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winner, quarterback <a>Terry Baker</a>. The <a>University of Oregon</a> is often seen as the school's key athletic rival, with the annual <a>Civil War</a> football game between the two teams being one of the nation's longest-lived rivalries.</p>
<p><a>Trysting Tree</a> is the name of Oregon State's golf course, dedicated in 1988, the tournament level course has been recognized by <em><a>Golfweek</a></em> magazine as one of the top five collegiate golf courses on the West Coast. Its name is traced to a tree near Benton Hall where student couples would meet and make dates.</p>
<p><a>Basketball</a> is held in <a>Gill Coliseum</a>, named after former Beavers coach <a>Slats Gill</a>. The <a>Civil War</a> is one of the most contested rivalries in the nation.</p>
<p><a>Baseball</a> is held in <a>Goss Stadium at Coleman Field</a>. The OSU baseball team, managed by <a>Pat Casey</a>, won back-to-back <a>NCAA Division I Baseball Championship</a>s in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p><a>Softball</a> is held in the OSU Softball Complex. Opened in April 2001, the $1.5 million dollar OSU Softball Complex seats 750. Oregon State hosted a Regional and Super Regional tournament in the 2006 NCAA tournament, winning both and moving on to the Women's College World Series.</p>
<p>Oregon State has a total of three <a>NCAA</a> championships. In addition to the two baseball titles, the Beavers won the 1961 <a>NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship</a>. In 1975, the men's <a>rowing</a> Varsity-4 with coxswain team won the <a>Intercollegiate Rowing Association</a> National Collegiate Rowing Championships in <a>Syracuse, New York</a>, establishing a course record which stood for 15 years. In 2006 and 2008, the Oregon State racquetball team won the USA <a>Racquetball</a> intercollegiate championship.</p>
<p>Oregon State University is also home to the oldest <a>Marching Band</a> in the PAC-10. The <a>Oregon State University Marching Band</a> was started in 1890 and has become a staple at Beaver Football games. OSU football coach Mike Riley credits the marching band with 10 points at each home game and 6 at each away game.</p>
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>As of 2009, the total student enrollment (undergraduate and graduate) at OSU was 21,969. As of November 11, 2010, total enrollment had increased to 23,761 students.</p>
<p>In accordance with the University&#x2019;s mission for diversity, many organizations, clubs, and departments have been formed, including the Office Of Community and Diversity and several cultural and resource centers.</p>
<p>Oregon State University has several cultural centers aimed at promoting diversity and supporting students of color, including the Lonnie B. Harris Black Cultural Center, Native American Longhouse, Asian &amp; Pacific Cultural Center, and the Centro Cultural C&#x00e9;sar Ch&#x00e1;vez.</p>
