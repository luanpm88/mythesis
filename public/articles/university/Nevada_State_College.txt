<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>In 2002, as part of the Clark County Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act of 2002, the US Congress conveyed  to the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) and the City of Henderson for the express purpose of creating a new four-year institution of higher education..</p>
<p>Under the leadership and guidance of its late President, Dr. <a>Fred Maryanski</a>, Nevada State College acquired accreditation, moved with its master plan for a  campus, saw rising enrollment, and the opening of its first permanent building, the Liberal Arts and Sciences building in August 2008.  The  building has faculty offices, labs and seven classrooms. The building includes SMART classroom technologies which allow professors to use a wide array of audio and visual teaching techniques, and scientific equipment for educational use. </p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>Nevada State College offers regular and accelerated nursing degrees, education degrees, and liberal arts majors including psychology, biology, history, English, and criminal justice.</p>
<h2>Proposals to close down NSC</h2>
<p>The Nevada System of Higher Education, faces a $900 million budget deficit. Due to budget cuts, there have been proposals to close down Nevada State College along with other NHSE programs and schools.</p>
<p>On May 10, 2008, Nevada State College held its fifth graduation ceremony. During the ceremony, officials referred to NSC as a small but growing college of roughly 2,000 students. Graduating students recognized the role that the faculty played throughout their college careers and the connection they felt to Nevada State College.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2008, Nevada State College launched <a>Nevada</a>&#x2019;s first bachelor of science degree in the education of the deaf and hard of hearing. The program addresses the deaf culture and its integration of deaf students into specific subject areas.</p>
<p>Nevada State College also partners with <a>Touro University</a> to accommodate students in <a>Occupational Therapy</a>. Through the partnership, students complete three years of their bachelor degree in Occupational Therapy Science at Nevada State College, then transfer to Touro University for the final two years.</p>
<h2>Low graduation rate</h2>
<p>As of the end of spring 2008, Nevada State College has graduated 16% of the full-time students who registered as freshmen in fall 2002, and 11% of 2003's incoming freshmen.  A graduation rate of 16% is one-third that of California&#x2019;s public state colleges.  School officials characterize the rate as low, and are launching programs to increase student retention.</p>
<h2>Low enrollments</h2>
<p>Nevada State College was once troubled by low enrollments in majors like business administration. In 2008, the management program at Nevada State College expected to have 40 students in its third year but had only two.</p>
<p>In 2008 Nevada State College launched a campus-wide recruitment and retention initiative. Between the Spring 2009 and Spring 2010 semesters, Nevada State College increased enrollment by over 20%, to over 2,600 students.</p>
<h2>Budget cuts and student protests</h2>
<p>Among the different educational institutions of the NHSE, the largest 2009 budget cuts by the state legislature were for Nevada State College at 24.1%. Neighboring <a>College of Southern Nevada</a> had its budget cut by only 4.9%. </p>
<p>Nevada State College budget cuts could have resulted in larger class sizes, fewer available classes and construction project delays. This has led to student protests. According to NSC officials, budget cuts have left student services understaffed, and about 25% of the university's teaching and administrative positions will be left vacant in 2008.  The university has laid off an undisclosed number of staff in 2008 as a cost saving measure. These layoffs could hurt student services such as counseling and financial aid.</p>
<p>In August 2008, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported &quot;Officials there are considering more drastic reductions as the newbie in Nevada's higher education system faces the prospect of more state-mandated budget cuts. The school's president warned Tuesday that the cuts will probably mean fewer classes available, which could mean some students will lose financial aid or take longer to graduate... Gov. Jim Gibbons has proposed cutting next year's budgets by another 14 percent.&quot; NSC officials have also formed a committee to consider whether to hold back a part of each unit's operating budget for a mid-year review and impose a credit surcharge on student tuition.</p>
<p>In January 2010, students initiated the &quot;myNSCstory&quot; campaign as a response to proposed budget cuts and tuition increases. The campaign involves handwritten notes from students, accompanied by photos, sent to state officials. Over 10% of the entire student body participated.</p>
<h2>Tuition, fees and financial aid</h2>
<p>For the 2010-2011 academic year, Nevada residents will pay $103.25 per credit for tuition, plus student fees.</p>
<p>Nevada State College offers financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships, and loans.</p>
