<p> <strong>Leonard Hoar</strong> (1630 &ndash; November 28, 1675) was an English-born early American minister and educator, who spent a short and troubled term as <a>President of Harvard College</a>.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>Born in <a>Gloucestershire</a> about 1630, he was the fourth son of Charles Hoare, by Joanna Hinkesman of Gloucester. Some time after the death of his father in 1638 he emigrated with his mother to America. Hoar, as he thenceforth called himself, graduated at <a>Harvard College</a> in 1650, and in 1653 returned to England, where he became a preacher. Through the interest of <a>Sir Henry Mildmay</a> he was beneficed at <a>Wanstead</a>, <a>Essex</a>, from which he was ejected by the <a>1662 Act of Uniformity</a>. A Cambridge M.A. by incorporation, he was awarded the degree of M.D. by Cambridge <em>per literas regias</em> in 1671.</p>
<h2>Harvard Presidency and death</h2>
<p>In 1672 Hoar went again to Massachusetts to preach, by invitation, at the <a>Old South Church</a>, Boston. He brought a letter, dated 5 February 1672, addressed to the magistrates and ministers in Massachusetts Bay by thirteen nonconformist ministers in and around London, friends of the colony and  agents in raising funds for a new college building, who strongly recommended Hoar for the post of president of Harvard as successor to <a>Charles Chauncy</a>, who died 19 February 1672. The general court voted an increase of salary on the condition that Hoar was elected. He was accordingly chosen, to the disappointment of <a>Urian Oakes</a>, who was widely regarded as Chauncy's legitimate successor. Hoar was immediately elected and installed as President of Harvard on December 10, 1672; a position he held until he resigned on March 15, 1675. </p>
<p>Hoar had high ambitions for Harvard as research centre, as he wrote to <a>Robert Boyle</a> at this time. He was the first president of Harvard College who was also a graduate of it; but he was not well liked by his students or the people of Massachusetts, in part because of his radical religious views. The facts of his time in office remain obscure.</p>
<p><a>Daniel Munro Wilson</a> wrote</p>
<p>:&quot;At all events the students fell away from the president, and 'set themselves to <em>Travestie</em> whatever he <em>did</em> and <em>said</em>, and aggravate everything in his behavior disagreeable to them, with a design to make him Odious'.&quot;</p>
<p><a>Cotton Mather</a> in his <em><a>Magnalia Christi Americana</a></em> stated that :&quot;He was forced to resign ... 'his grief threw him into a <a>Consumption</a> whereof he died November 28, 1675 in Boston'. (Cotton Mather)&quot;</p>
<p>His epitaph in the Hancock Cemetery at <a>Quincy, Massachusetts</a> reads:</p>
<p>:<em>Leonard Hoar - died Nov.28,1675 in Boston a.45, and interred here Dec.6, new gs.</em></p>
<p>His wife Bridget, daughter of <a>John Lisle</a> the regicide, died at Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 May 1723. By her he had two daughters: Bridget, who married, on 21 June 1689, the Rev. Thomas Cotton of London, a liberal benefactor of Harvard College; and Tryphena.</p>
