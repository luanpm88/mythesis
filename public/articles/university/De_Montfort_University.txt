<p></p>
<p><strong>De Montfort University</strong> is a university situated in the centre of <a>Leicester</a>, <a>England</a>. It currently receives more funding for its research than any other post-1992 university, and has the second highest number of National Teacher Fellows of all UK universities. It is composed of two campuses; Leicester City and the outlying Charles Frears. The former has seen recent developments, such as the new &#x00a3;35 million <a>Hugh Aston</a> Building; constructed to bring students from the <a>Faculty of Business and Law</a> closer to the centre of the university's infrastructure. </p>
<p>The university is organised into faculties, comprising <a>Art and Design</a>, <a>Business and Law</a>, <a>Health and Life Sciences</a>, <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Technology</a> and the <a>Institute of Creative Technologies</a>. Whilst teaching takes place primarily on the Leicester City campus, the <a>School of Nursing and Midwifery</a> is based on the Charles Frears campus. This is set to change, following the School's planned relocation to the city campus in 2011.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>[[Image:Leicester Clock Tower Simon de Montfort.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] on the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower in <a>Leicester</a>, <a>England</a>]] De Montfort University is named after <a>Simon de Montfort</a>, a 13th century <a>Earl</a> of Leicester; credited with establishing the first <a>parliament</a> in 1265. It is one of two universities situated in the city of <a>Leicester</a>, along with the <a>University of Leicester</a>. Its origins trace back to the <em>Leicester School of Art</em>, established in 1870 on a voluntary basis. The school quickly expanded in response to the changing needs of late 19th century industry; leading to the introduction of subjects such as <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Building</a> and <a>Machine Drawing</a>.</p>
<p>By 1897, it was clear the buildings being used were no longer suitable, and so &#x00a3;25,000 was raised to build 'a very handsome school that would be enormous credit to the town and &#x2026; so that it would answer its purpose for the next 100 years'. The building in question is the Hawthorn Building, which today still houses the sciences; in the shape of the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences. At the time of the first phase of the Hawthorn Building construction, there were 500 art students and 1,000 technical students. In 1903, a letter from <a>Her Majesty's Inspector</a> praised the success of the technical subjects. Ever increasing demand for courses prompted an extension to the Hawthorn Building in 1909. In 1919, further properties were rented. Her Grace, the <a>Duchess of Atholl</a>, laid the foundation stone of Hawthorn's new west wing in 1927; by which time the establishment was known under by the joint name of <em>The Leicester Colleges of Art and Technology</em>. Originally, the institution aimed to become a multi-campus <a>collegiate university</a> comprising the entire <a>East Midlands</a>, and as such, the university swiftly acquired other campuses based in <a>Bedford</a>, <a>Luton</a>, <a>Lincoln</a>, the Scraptoft College of Education in east Leicester, <a>Caythorpe</a> and <a>Milton Keynes</a>. The Milton Keynes campus had actually been built by the university in 1981 and officially opened by <a>Queen Elizabeth</a> in 1982, prior to the official foundation of De Montfort University as a <a>New University</a>. Departments at Milton Keynes included <a>computing</a>, built environment and <a>business</a>. De Montfort University conducted a series of expansionist mergers with the <a>Bedford College of Higher Education</a> and with the Lincoln and Caythorpe Colleges in 1994, and then in 1995 with the Leicester-based Charles Frears College of Nursing and Midwifery.</p>
<h3>Restructuring</h3>
<p>In 2001, the Board of Governors adopted a new strategy to do 'fewer things in fewer places' and reduce the number of outlying campuses. De Montfort University consolidated around its Leicester campus, with its satellite sites closed, or transferred to other institutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The former Lincolnshire College of Art and Design and the Lincolnshire College of Agriculture, based in <a>Lincoln</a> and <a>Caythorpe</a> respectively, were merged with the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside to form the new <a>University of Lincoln</a> in 2001.</li>
  <li>Following the relocation to Leicester of many of the courses offered in Milton Keynes, the Kents Hill campus was considered economically unviable and was closed in 2003. The premises were sold to the <a>Open University</a>, which now uses them to house its student administration offices. The Scraptoft Campus, which previously housed the university's courses in teaching, also closed in 2003.</li>
  <li>The last remaining campus at <a>Bedford</a>, housing the Faculty of Education and Contemporary Studies, was merged with the University of Luton to become the <a>University of Bedfordshire</a> in 2006.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Present day</h3>
<p>Today, De Montfort University has two campuses, Leicester City and Charles Frears. Recently, the University has been redeveloping the Leicester City Campus; adding two new buildings. The Performance Arts Centre for Excellence (PACE), funded by a &#x00a3;4.5 Million grant from the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a>, was opened in 2007 by the BBC's Creative Director Alan Yentob. A new building for the Faculty of Business and Law - the Hugh Aston building - opened in September 2009. The new Business and Law centre has the iconic Magazine Square at its centre and cost &#x00a3;35 million.</p>
<p>The University has approximately 20,500 students, 3,240 staff and an annual turnover in the region of &#x00a3;132.5 million.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>According to the university, &#x00a3;186.5 million has been invested into its campus and surroundings in recent years, with the aim of &quot;[offering] students the most inspiring working environments and access to industry standard, state-of-the-art facilities&quot;. These developments include;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Art and Design Buildings:
    <ul>
      <li>Plans are in progress for a brand new dedicated Art and Design building on the edge of the River Soar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sports Facilities:
    <ul>
      <li>There are plans for a &#x00a3;6 million expansion of the John Sandford Sports Centre. This will include expanded facilities and a swimming pool for use by students and the general public.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Health Centre:
    <ul>
      <li>The university has sold land on Grasmere Street to allow space for a brand new Health Centre. This is still in the planning stage but will provide a full health care service for both students of the university and the local community.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Public Squares:
    <ul>
      <li>The current buildings of the Gateway site are to be demolished, creating a new public square and improving the area. This will link with other public squares across the campus, and new landscaping, lighting, street furniture and public art structures will create a &#x2018;one campus&#x2019; feel and a vibrant and pleasant place to study.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>The Faculty of Art and Design</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Ian Livingstone (left) praised De Montfort's Game Art course, the first of its kind in England to gain Skillset accreditation</a> The Faculty of Art and Design boasts the only university courses in the world to specialise in <a>lingerie</a>, <a>underwear</a>, body-wear, <a>swimwear</a> and performance sportswear, which first began after the Second World War. The Faculty also offers the only UK university courses in Footwear Design. One of the Faculty's most innovative courses is its BA (Hons) Game Art Design degree; the first game art course in England to be accredited by <a>Skillset</a>. <a>Ian Livingstone</a>, Chair of Skillset&#x2019;s Computer Games Skills Council and Life <a>President</a> at <a>Eidos</a>, commented that &quot;accreditation is a rigorous process, but De Montfort&#x2019;s course shows what standards can be achieved with a curriculum designed with games industry input from day one.&quot; The last government <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE) gave the Faculty's research a 4* rating, indicating world-leading quality.</p>
<p>The university deems their Art and Design courses as being &quot;strongly vocational as well as creative&quot;, and note that professional technicians are employed to aid students of the Faculty. Selected students have won prestigious national and international awards, participated in exhibition events, gained placements and sponsorships. The Faculty also has an international presence; running teaching and research projects with Russia, India and China, whilst maintaining close connections with other Faculties within the university, including Technology and Humanities.</p>
<p>Facilities of the Faculty include the Retail Lab; a facility which aims to support the development of insight into sustainable and resource efficient retail design. The university describes it as allowing a &quot;unique approach to conducting research and development ... [which] places the consumer at the heart of investigations&quot;. The facility has a virtual test space for concept evaluations, a dedicated area for conducting training and exhibitions, and a knowledge bank focusing on five specialist areas: legislation, supply chain, build, fit and consumer experience. The Lab works with businesses to identify research and development needs; bringing together researchers from across the university to work on projects. Expertise involved in projects may range from social scientists or technologists to designers. The university's areas of expertise span lighting, architecture, <a>textiles</a>, <a>fashion</a>, <a>packaging</a> and product design, as well as business and law.</p>
<h3>The Faculty of Business and Law</h3>
<p>[[Image:Magazine Square, Leicester.jpg|thumb|Magazine Square, with the Hugh Aston Building and the medieval [[Magazine Gateway]]]] The Faculty of Business and Law incorporates the Leicester Business School and the Leicester De Montfort Law School. The Faculty has a long history of international partnerships; in 1997, it collaborated to help found a business school in <a>India</a> - the <a>Daly College</a> Business School.</p>
<p>The Leicester Business School was regarded by The Sunday Times as one of the top 10 business schools in the UK, whilst the 2007 <a>National Student Survey</a> ranked it seventh out of 110 institutions for student satisfaction. It comprises over 4000 students and 150 academic staff, making it one of the larger providers of business and management education in the UK. The School offers a variety of degree courses, including undergraduate, specialist Master's, MBA and research degrees; taught by the School&#x2019;s six Departments of <a>Accounting</a> and <a>Finance</a>, <a>Corporate Development</a>, <a>Human Resource Management</a>, <a>Marketing</a>, <a>Public Policy</a> and Strategy and <a>Management</a>. All students of the Business School have the opportunity to take part in placement schemes, offering students one year paid employment (taken after their second year) with UK and multinational employers such as <a>HSBC</a>, the <a>Audit Commission</a>, <a>Xerox</a>, <a>Siemens</a>, <a>Intel</a>, <a>Cadburys</a> and the <a>NHS</a>, among others.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Business and Law is based in the Hugh Aston Building; a &#x00a3;35 million investiture officially opened in March 2010 by <a>Patrick McKenna</a>, founder and Chief Executive of <a>Ingenious Media</a>, one of the country&#x2019;s leading media investment companies. The event took place in the presence of a cross section of the local and academic community. Various activities took place during the day, including a mock court trial, a performance of the music of Hugh Aston, a <a>Tudor</a> <a>composer</a>, a lecture by Patrick McKenna and a celebratory lunch and reception. The construction of the building released the 14th Century Magazine Gateway from four lanes of traffic, allowing an attractive tree-lined square to be created; the Magazine Square. </p>
<p>The facility caters for 6,000 students and staff in total, and as well as having numerous large lecture theatres equipped with audio-visual technologies, it contains a mock courtroom, law library and dedicated law clinic. There is also a bespoke suite for postgraduate and professional education. Social spaces within the building include a caf&#x00e9;, public atriums, and a bookshop. The building was made using sustainable low maintenance construction materials, with the primary goal of maximising natural daylight and ventilation. The building received an &#x2018;excellent&#x2019; rating by the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM). The building&#x2019;s namesake, Hugh Aston, died in November 1558 and was a leading figure of his generation; serving at different times as <a>Coroner</a>, <a>Mayor</a> and <a>Member of Parliament</a> for the borough of Leicester, as well as being one of the foremost early Tudor composers.</p>
<h3>The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences</h3>
<h4>History of the Faculty</h4>
<p>The Faculty of Health and Life Science is De Montfort&#x2019;s largest faculty, housing roughly 400 full-time and part-time staff, as well as approximately 5000 students. It is composed of four interconnected schools: Allied Health Sciences, Applied Social Sciences, Nursing and Midwifery and the Leicester School of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The Faculty is based in the Hawthorn Building, which was previously an Arts College; boasting an art-deco turn style and stage area which now functions as a lecture theatre. <a>David Bowie</a> and <a>Jimmy Hendrix</a> were reported to have played at the venue in the 1960s. There are ancient archways visible on the lower ground floor; supposedly remnants from a monastery which occupied the sight prior to the building's construction. Perhaps owing to this, there are reports of a ghostly monk prowling the corridors. The Faculty underwent a major change in 2000 when the School of Biology, based at Scraptoft Campus, moved to the Leicester Campus, and the faculty will become fully centred around the university's City campus in 2011 when the School of Nursing relocates from the Charles Frears campus.</p>
<h4>Undergraduate Courses</h4>
<p>The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences offers around 30 undergraduate health and science-related degree courses, and where relevant these courses are accredited by professional bodies. For example, Forensic Science BSc Honours is accredited by Forensic Science Society, and Biomedical Science BSc Honours is accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Science and endorsed by the Health Professions Council. It&#x2019;s sister degree Medical Science BmedSci Honours has more of a clinical focus and attracts students wishing to go on to study medicine. A full list of the courses offered by the Faculty can be found on the university's website: <a>Health and Life Science Courses.</a></p>
<p>The four schools interrelate so as to allow collaboration across subject boundaries in teaching, consultancy and research. Between them, the Schools cover not just laboratory sciences but mentioned above but Child, Adolescent and Family Therapy; Community Studies; Criminal Justice; Counselling and Psychotherapy; Criminology; Environmental Awareness; Management; Protection and Technology; Forensic Science; Health and Community Studies; Midwifery; Nursing; Pharmacy; Psychology; Social Work; and Speech and Language Therapy. New courses include a Foundation in Healthcare Science, and new postgraduate courses include MSc Advanced Biomedical Science, MSc Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and MSc in Pharmaceutical Quality by Design.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The faculty has been awarded &#x00a3;2M for development from the HEFCE Science Research Investment Fund (SRIF) 2 initiative, funding cutting edge laboratory facilities. Other current developments include the installation of a Scanning Electron Microcope, the first of its kind in Europe, in December 2010.</li>
  <li>Social Work has received &#x00a3;200,000 from the HEFCE Capability Initiative to embark on further development of already successful areas such as ethnicity, Connexions, criminal justice and parenting.</li>
  <li>Nursing and Midwifery are part of a &#x00a3;250,000 JISC/HEA programme to produce Open Educational Resources for continuing professional development (TIGER). </li>
  <li>The School of Allied Health Sciences has received &#x00a3;125,000 as part of the JISC/HEA Open Educational Resource programme to release resources on Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia (<a>Sickle Cell Anaemia OER</a>). The school participated in the pilot phase building the Virtual Analytical Laboratory(<a>VAL</a>), a freely available laboratory skills resource with over 200 pages of multimedia resources which now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Faculty also boasts six Teacher Fellows who are driving pedagogic research across the four schools.</p>
<h3>The Faculty of Humanities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Clephan building, home to the Faculty of Humanities</a> The Faculty of Humanities offers traditional subjects including <a>English</a>, <a>History</a> and <a>Politics</a>, as well as more modern courses in areas such as <a>Arts Management</a> and <a>Creative Writing</a>. In 2008, the Faculty submitted research in five areas for examination in the government's Research Assessment Exercise. These areas comprised English, <a>Film</a> and <a>Media</a>, <a>Dance</a> and <a>Drama</a>, <a>Music Technology</a> and History. 87% of the work assessed subsequently achieved international status. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The results for English placed the university near the top of the table, ranking 9th out of 87 universities in the UK in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> Listing.</li>
  <li>40% of the university's research into English was given the highest grade of 4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating world leading quality and placing the Faculty alongside the universities of <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> for its research.</li>
  <li>History was rated as having 85% of its work of international standing &#x2013; credited by the university as a testimony to the success of its <a>International Centre for Sports History and Culture</a>.</li>
  <li>Film and Media Studies also moved up the league tables; rated by the Times Higher listings as 15th, higher than Oxford University. 25% of the work in this area was judged to be world leading, with 90% ranked as international in its reach.</li>
  <li>Dance and Drama were also judged to have world-leading research, with 80% of its activities being judged as international in profile. The <a>Centre for Music, Technology and Innovation</a>, known for its international collaborations, has been judged to have 85% of its research activities and outputs in the international category; with 15% of that work in the &#x2018;world leading&#x2019;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Faculty currently holds five National Teacher Fellows; the latest being Dr Deborah Cartmell, Reader in English, who was made a Fellow in recognition of excellence in teaching and learning support. Dr Cartmell developed the university's pioneering <a>Master's degree</a> in <a>Adaptation Studies</a> and is a founding member of the <a>British Shakespeare Association</a> and the Association of Adaptation Studies. Other National Teacher Fellows within the Faculty include Rob Brannen, Alasdair Blair and Jayne Stevens.</p>
<p>The Faculty is based within the Clephan Building, which was refurbished specifically for its use. Most classes and lectures associated with the Faculty take place in the building and all of its academic and support staff are based there. It comprises a large amount of teaching accommodation, equipped with the latest <a>audio-visual</a> equipment in order to facilitate a modern learning environment. There is a Student Advice Centre on the ground floor, as well as an Academic Guidance Centre and resources rooms with more specialist facilities. These include the Arts Management resources room, a newsroom for prospective <a>journalists</a>, and a digital Music Technology recording studio, labs and performance area. The Clephan Building also houses a dedicated Computer Centre for Humanities students. This Centre includes a Media lab with <a>Apple</a> Power-Mac computers, cinema screens and creative software applications. There is no fee incurred for students of the university wishing to use these facilities. </p>
<p>The Clephan Building also plays host to the internationally-recognised <a>Cultural Exchanges</a> event, which features guests and speakers from the arts, media, literature, politics and film. It began in 2000, and attracts upwards of 4,000 visitors annually. Recent visitors to the festival have included the <a>screenwriter</a> and <a>novelist</a> <a>Andrew Davies</a>, famous for his work in the field of adaptation; novelist <a>Adele Parks</a>, a highly acclaimed women's fiction author nominated for the Romantic Novelist of the Year award; and <a>Janet Street-Porter</a>, a <a>British</a> <a>media personality</a>, journalist, <a>television presenter</a> and <a>producer</a>. The main programme is often complemented by workshops, day conferences and performing arts events, with heavy involvement on the part of the university's students. The festival is in fact run by students on the BA (Hons) Arts and Festival Management course.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|A portion of the FIFA Master's course is taught at the SDA Bocconi School of Management in Italy, seen above</a> Recently, the Faculty has collaborated with two other <a>Europe</a>an universities to offer a new Master's course, based in its International Centre for Sports History and Culture: the MA Management, Law and Humanities of Sport. Organised by Centre International d&#x2019;Etude du Sport (CIES) and endorsed by <a>Federation Internationale de Football Association</a> (FIFA), the course was created to promote management education within the sports world. It is ostensibly recognised as one of the top graduate programmes in sport, The Humanities of Sport module is organised by the International Centre for Sport History and Culture at De Montfort, whilst the Management of Sport module is taught by <a>SDA Bocconi School of Management</a> in <a>Italy</a> and the final Sports Law module by <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Neuch&#x00e2;tel</a> in Switzerland. Course patrons have included <a>Joseph S. Blatter</a>, <a>Lord Coe</a>, <a>Sir Bobby Charlton</a> and <a>Sergei Bubka</a>. As of 2010, the course has produced more than 200 graduates from over 70 different nations. </p>
<p>The course also includes an extensive guest speaker and field visit programme with visits to leading sports organisations such as the <a>International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC), FIFA, <a>UEFA</a>, <a>All England Lawn Tennis Club</a> Wimbledon, the <a>Professional Footballers Association</a>, <a>Manchester United</a> as well as others. 79% of FIFA Master graduates now work in sport, employed by such organisations as <a>Nike</a> <a>China</a>, FIFA (<a>Switzerland</a>), IOC (Switzerland), <a>Adidas</a> (<a>Germany</a>), Nationale Anti-Doping Agentur (Germany), <a>MLS Major League Soccer</a> (USA) and USA Rugby (USA). The course's academic committee is headed by Professor Denis Oswald; a member of the International Olympic Committee Executive Board and Head of the Co-ordination Commission for the <a>2012 London Olympic Games</a>.</p>
<h3>The Faculty of Technology</h3>

<p></p>
<h2>Student Facilities</h2>
<h3>Campus Centre</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Campus Centre Building.</a> The Campus Centre offers numerous facilities for students at De Montfort University. The building was completed in September 2003, and sits at the heart of De Montfort University's Leicester City site, fulfilling a number of functions and providing a wide range of services. According to the university, the building's 6,000 square metres contains: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Retail outlets</li>
  <li>University catering for staff and students</li>

</ul>
<p>The building is a three floor steel frame construction with a glass curtain wall frontage designed by <a>Ellis Williams Architects</a>, the company responsible for the <a>Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art</a> in Gateshead. It was constructed by Balfour Beatty on the site of the old Stibbe building, at a cost of &#x00a3;8.5 million and is central to De Montfort University's <a>'Masterplan'</a>, which seeks to regenerate the Leicester campus environment.</p>
<p>It houses the <a>De Montfort University Students' Union</a>, comprising various societies such as Demon FM a student radio station that runs 24 hours a day; Demon TV; and The Demon, a fortnightly university newspaper. The Students' Union also runs its own lettings agency, known as <a>DSU Lettings</a>. There is a food court situated in the building, as well as a bar named 'Level 1' and a pub named 'The Graduate'. There is also a <a>Spar</a> supermarket.</p>
<h3>The Kimberlin Library</h3>
<p>Opened in 1977, extended in 1997 and extensively refurbished in 2007, The Kimberlin Library is open 24 hours a day during term time, enabling students to study whenever it suits their schedule. There is also an <em>@ccess anywhere</em> scheme, allowing students to access a portion of the library's facilities remotely, at any time. The new Learning Zone on the ground floor provides space for group and individual work and has workstations with power supplies for laptops. </p>
<p>There are also syndicate rooms available for use by students, comprising interactive whiteboards as well as DVD and video facilities; providing students with an opportunity to collaborate and rehearse presentations. Kimberlin Library has an overall seating capacity of around 1150, of which around 450 have PC or MAC provision. The upper floors of the library cater for more traditional Quiet and Silent study needs. DMU Library Services gained a satisfaction rating of 4.2 in the 2010 National Student Survey.</p>
<h3>The Eric Wood Learning Zone</h3>
<p>The ground floor of the adjacent Eric Wood Building was extended and developed into a Learning Zone, providing 180 more modern study places and up-to-date study facilities. This was opened on 12 January 2009.</p>
<p>A third learning space with accommodation for another 200 study spaces is planned for Summer 2011 to coincide with the relocation of the Charles Frears campus to the city centre.</p>
<h2>Affiliations</h2>
<p>The University has special arrangements with more than 80 universities and colleges in over 25 countries, as well as with the Digital Media Centre (DMC) which was partly funded by De Montfort University who put &#x00a3;1 Million into the project in <a>Leicester</a> City Centre.  Through the university's involvement, the DMC will benefit from the latest research in media and related technologies. Students on appropriate courses will have the opportunity to use the production and educational facilities at the Centre. </p>
<h2>Pharmacy course controversy</h2>
<p>On 20 April 2006, <em><a>The Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em> reported that first year pharmacy students in 2004 who underperformed in examinations were allowed to progress to the next year of the MPharm course at De Montfort University School of Pharmacy avoiding resits, despite concern from lecturers and external examiners. This followed from the release of documents of meeting minutes, in a ruling under the <a>Freedom of Information Act 2000</a>.</p>
<p><em><a>The Daily Telegraph</a></em> reported that the University &quot;has been caught lowering a pass mark to 26 per cent to prevent widespread failure of students, ... the proof that up to 14 per cent was arbitrarily added to the scores of trainee pharmacists to save the university's reputation has renewed concerns over the dumbing down of degrees in the move toward mass higher education.&quot;</p>
<p>Subsequently, the <a>Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain</a> put the pharmacy course on a probationary status and required the University to implement a five-point action plan. The School remains one of 26 in the UK that the Society accredits for offering recognised degrees in pharmacy.</p>
