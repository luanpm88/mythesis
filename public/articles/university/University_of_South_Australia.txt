<h2>School of Arts</h2>
<p>One of its antecedent institutions, the South Australian School of Arts, dates back to 1861 when it was established as the &quot;School of Design&quot;, (became &quot;School of Design Painting and Technical Arts&quot; in 1892, then &quot;South Australian School of Arts and Crafts&quot; in 1909, then &quot;South Australian School of Art&quot; in 1958) which makes it one of the oldest art schools in Australia, and its oldest public art school. The South Australian School of Arts, an established school within the Division of Education, Arts and Social Sciences, provides the most prestigious and valuable visual arts scholarship in Australia, the Gordon Samstag Scholarship.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> &lt;!-- Could someone please fill out this section? --&gt; The University of South Australia was formed in 1991 with the merger of the South Australian Institute of Technology (SAIT) with three of the campuses (Magill, Salisbury and Underdale) of the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE). The two other SACAE campuses, City and Sturt, were merged with the <a>University of Adelaide</a> and <a>Flinders University</a> respectively. To the former SACAE campuses of Magill, Salisbury and Underdale, SAIT added to the merger its three campuses at City East, The Levels (now known as Mawson Lakes) and Whyalla.</p>
<p>Salisbury campus was vacated in 1996, but its sale was held up for many years by litigation. In 1997, a new campus was opened at City West. In 2005, the campus at Underdale was closed as part of the Blueprint 2005 project, and its programmes were moved to other campuses. Some services still reside at Underdale such as Document Services.  Blueprint 2005 also involved a number of new buildings, in particular at City West and Mawson Lakes.</p>

<h2>Commercialisation</h2>
<p><a>ITEK</a> was formed in 1999, its role is to implement an integrated framework for the management of intellectual property, from the early stages of research through to commercialisation (from the ITEK website). Through ITEK and the <a>Wearable Computer Lab</a>, the University has established the first gaming company <a>A-Rage</a> which solely looks at augmented reality gaming systems, though both groups have since disbanded.</p>
<p>ITEK famously rejected the remote laboratory <a>NetLab</a> for want of new and distinct functionality that would make it patentable, disregarding other <a>intellectual property</a> considerations such as <a>copyright</a>, <a>design</a> legislation and <a>confidential information</a>, though was subsequently awarded $3.8m by the <a>federal</a> <a>commonwealth</a> <a>Australian</a> government.</p>
