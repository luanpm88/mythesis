<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Autonomous University of Barcelona was officially created by legislative decree on June 6, 1968. Previously, during the <a>Second Spanish Republic</a>, there had been plans for constituting a second university in <a>Barcelona</a>, but the <a>Civil War</a> and the following years of poverty under the early <a>dictatorship</a> did not allow these plans to become a reality until that year.</p>
<p>On July 27, a disposition to the decree was added, starting the creation of the Faculty of Letters, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Economical Sciences. Around ten weeks later, on October 6, the first course of the Faculty of Letters was inaugurated at <a>Sant Cugat del Vall&#x00e8;s</a> Monastery. During the same month, the Faculty of Medicine was created at the <a>Hospital de Sant Pau</a> in <a>Barcelona</a>.</p>
<p>In 1969, an agreement was signed for the acquisition of the land where the university campus is currently located. During that year, the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Economical Sciences started running. During the following three years, several faculties and professional schools were created, and the construction works on the campus land took place. At the end of this period, most existing Faculties and Schools are settled in the campus.</p>
<p>At the end of the dictatorship in 1976, the University introduced a plan to create a model of a democratic, independent university, described in a document known as <em>Bellaterra Manifesto</em>, which included a declaration of principles. Two years later, after the approval of the <a>Catalan Statute</a>, the University Council agreed to recourse to the <a>Generalitat de Catalunya</a>.</p>
<p>During the period between 1985 and 1992, the University underwent several faculty reforms and the creation of several new faculties. In 1993, the Universitary Ville was inaugurated as a student residence integrated inside the Campus complex.</p>
