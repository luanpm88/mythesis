<p> The <strong>University of Southern California</strong> (commonly called <strong>USC</strong>, SC, and other names) is a <a>private</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, research university located in <a>Los Angeles</a>, <a>California</a>, <a>USA</a>. USC was founded in 1880, making it California's oldest private research university.</p>
<p>USC's four year, full-time undergraduate program enrolled 16,751 undergraduate students in Fall 2009. USC is currently ranked 23rd among national universities by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, which classified it as one of the &quot;most selective universities&quot; for admitting 24.4% of the 35,753 people who applied for freshman admission in 2009, and 73rd worldwide by the 2010-11 <a>Times Higher Education</a> rankings.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;freshprof&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THES&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2009 freshman profile, 22% of admissions were associated with <a>legacy preferences</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;freshprof&quot;/&gt; USC is also home to 18,073 graduate and professional students in a number of different programs, including business, law, and medicine.</p>
<p>The university has a &quot;very high&quot; level of research activity and received $463.7 million in sponsored research from 2008 to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usc.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USC was named &quot;College of the Year 2000&quot; by the editors of <a><em>Time</em></a> and <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> for the university's extensive community-service programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USC students hail from 112 countries, and all 50 states in the United States.&lt;ref name=USNDiversity2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.usc.edu/private/factbook/2010/international_bycountry_10.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>. Members of the sports teams, the <a>Trojans</a>, have won 92 NCAA team championships, ranking them third in the nation, and 358 NCAA individual championships, ranking them second in the nation.&lt;ref name=e1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trojan athletes have won 236 medals at the <a>Olympic games</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The cost of attendance at USC is high compared with most universities, at around $55,578 per year as of the 2010-2011 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its considerable cost, USC is the third most economically diverse top-ranked school.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Widney Alumni House, the campus' first building, has been moved several times to different locations on the main campus.</a></p>
<p>USC, the University of Southern California, was founded following the efforts of one, Judge <a>Robert M. Widney</a>, who helped secure donations from several figures in early Los Angeles history: a <a>Methodist</a> <a>horticulturist</a>, <a>Ozro Childs</a>, an <a>Irish Catholic</a> former-Governor, <a>John Gately Downey</a>, and a German Jewish banker, <a>Isaiah Hellman</a>. The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that &quot;no student would be denied admission because of race.&quot; The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952.</p>
<p>When USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president. The school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. The city lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones, and a reliable fire alarm system. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three&#x2014;two males and female <a>valedictorian</a> Minnie C. Miltimore. </p>
<p>The colors of USC are cardinal and gold, which were approved by USC's third president, the Reverend <a>George W. White</a>, in 1895. In 1958 the shade of gold, which was originally more of an orange color, was changed to a more yellow shade. The letterman's awards were the first to make the change.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|&quot;Tommy Trojan&quot; is a major symbol of the university, though he is not the mascot.</a> </p>
<p>USC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the <a>Trojan Shrine</a>, nicknamed &quot;Tommy Trojan&quot;, near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. During a fateful track and field meet with <a>Stanford University</a>, the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it was statistically impossible for USC to win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, <em><a>Los Angeles Times</a></em> sportswriter Owen Bird reported that the USC athletes &quot;fought on like Trojans,&quot; and the president of the university at the time, <a>George F. Bovard</a>, approved the name officially. </p>
<p>USC is the largest private employer in Los Angeles and the third-largest in the state of California and is responsible for $4 billion in economic output in <a>Los Angeles County</a>; USC students spend $406 million yearly in the local economy and visitors to the campus add another $12.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>For much of the late 20th century, USC had a reputation for being a politically <a>conservative</a> campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the politically charged times of the 1960s&ndash;70s, and in stark contrast to the University of California campuses, USC was one of the few campuses in California where then-<a>Governor</a> <a>Ronald Reagan</a> could visit without additional protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nixon to Nader&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;  This image may have been reinforced by the fact that in the early seventies, several conservative <a>Republican</a> alumni, known collectively as the &quot;USC mafia&quot;, served on then President <a>Richard Nixon</a>'s staff as well as during Nixon's reelection campaign, which was later tainted by the <a>Watergate scandal</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt;  In the 1960s, the corruption between conservative factions in student politics was noted in the screenplay for <em><a>All the President's Men</a></em>; the term <em><a>ratfucking</a></em> originates from that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nixon to Nader&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   By the 1990s, the conservative majority began to lose ground to an increasingly liberal voice, which has been attributed to the growing diversity, both regional and ethnic, of the student body; student membership in the USC <a>Democrats</a> has surpassed that of the USC Republicans in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt; USC has also been consistently ranked one of the most gay-friendly schools in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay-Friendly Schools&quot;&gt;<a>Newsweek 2010 Education Rankings</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Doheny Library</a></p>
<p>The University Park campus is in the <a>West Adams</a> district of <a>South Los Angeles</a>,  southwest of <a>Downtown Los Angeles</a>. The campus' boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through campus vehicle traffic has been banned. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the <a>Shrine Auditorium</a>, <a>Staples Center</a>, and <a>Los Angeles Coliseum</a>. Most buildings are in the <a>Romanesque</a> style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various <a>Modernist</a> styles (especially two large <a>Brutalist</a> dormitories at the campus' northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university <a>quad</a>s and gardens.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|Zumberge Hall, one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus</a></p>
<p>Besides its main campus (&quot;University Park Campus&quot;), which lies about  southwest of downtown Los Angeles, the university also operates the Health Sciences Campus about  northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the <a>Keck School of Medicine</a> and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an <a>Orange County</a> center in <a>Irvine</a> for business, pharmacy, social work and education; and the <a>Information Sciences Institute</a>, with centers in <a>Arlington, Virginia</a> and <a>Marina del Rey</a>. For its science students, USC operates the <a>Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies</a> located on <a>Catalina Island</a> just  off the coast of Los Angeles and home to the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Policy, Planning, and Development</a> also runs a satellite campus in <a>Sacramento</a>. In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> A Health Sciences <a>Alhambra</a> campus holds The Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.</p>
<p>USC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart, both by Derek Fitch. The first was prepared by <a>the Parkinsons</a> in 1920, which guided much of the campus' early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.</p>
<p>[[Image:052607-013-VKC-USC.jpg|right|thumb|The Von KleinSmid Center of International and Public Affairs, topped by a  globe, is the tallest structure on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Built under the second master plan, reflected a trend towards modernism.]]</p>
<p>The second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President <a>Norman Topping</a>, campus development director <a>Anthony Lazzaro</a>, and architect <a>William Pereira</a>. This plan annexed a great deal of the surrounding city and many of the older non-university structures within the new boundaries were leveled. Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s. Pereira maintained a predominantly red-brick architecture for the new buildings, but infused them with his trademark techno-modernism stylings.</p>
<p>USC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the <em>Time/Princeton Review College Guide</em>. </p>
<p>Roughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 <a>Watts Riots</a>, are credited for the safety of the university during the <a>1992 Los Angeles Riots</a>. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several <a>strip mall</a>s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus' western entrance). The <a>ZIP code</a> for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library, completed in the mid-1990s, reflected a shift to designs closer to earlier, Romanesque architecture.</a></p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Popovich Hall, home of the Marshall School of Business.</a></p>
<p>As well, USC has an endowment of $3.7 billion and also is allocated $430 million per year in sponsored research. USC became the only university to receive five separate nine-figure gifts:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;$120 million from Ambassador <a>Walter Annenberg</a> to create the <a>Annenberg Center for Communication</a> and a later Annenberg gift of $100 million for the <a>USC Annenberg School for Communication</a>; $112.5 million from <a>Alfred Mann</a> to establish the <a>Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering</a>; $110 million from the <a>W. M. Keck Foundation</a> for <a>USC's School of Medicine</a>; and most recently, $175 million from <a>George Lucas</a> to the <a>USC School of Cinema-Television</a>, now renamed <a>USC School of Cinematic Arts</a>.</p>
<p>Major new facilities opened with the infusion of new money include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>USC Medical Center</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> expansion.</li>
  <li>The <a>Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>International Residential College at Parkside</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>Marshall School of Business</a> <a>Popovich Hall</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>Galen Center</a> - home to <a>USC Basketball</a> and <a>USC Volleyball</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a>USC School of Cinematic Arts</a> Complex.</li>
  <li>The USC Ronald Tutor Campus Center and Trojan Plaza.</li>
  <li>The University Gateway Student Housing and Retail Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Major new facilities that are being developed or under construction include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>John McKay</a> Hall - the New USC Football Complex, Plaza, and Gardens (Groundbreaking January 2011).</li>
  <li>The University Village Shopping Center, Campus Offices, and Student Housing Redevelopment Project (Groundbreaking January 2010).</li>
  <li>The University Park 2030 Master Plan.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>The USC main campus is served by several <a>Metro</a> bus routes as well as <a>LADOT</a> DASH Route F.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the <a>Metro Expo Line</a>, a light-rail line currently under construction, will serve the campus when it opens in appx. 2011.  The Expo Line will have three stations in the vicinity of the USC main campus: <a>Jefferson/USC Station</a>, <a>Expo Park/USC Station</a>, and <a>Vermont/Expo Station</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Health Sciences campus</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|The original Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center</a> Located three miles (5&nbsp;km) from downtown Los Angeles and seven miles (11&nbsp;km) from the University Park campus, USC's Health Sciences campus is a major center for basic and clinical biomedical research in the fields of <a>cancer</a>, <a>gene therapy</a>, the <a>neuroscience</a>s, and <a>transplantation biology</a>, among others. The  campus is home to the region's first and oldest medical and pharmacy schools, as well as acclaimed programs in <a>physical therapy</a> and <a>occupational therapy</a> (which are ranked #1 and #3 respectively by U.S. News &amp; World Report). As well, USC physicians serve more than one million patients each year. </p>
<p>In addition to the <a>Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center</a>, which is one of the nation's largest teaching hospitals, the campus includes three patient care facilities: <a>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, <a>USC University Hospital</a>, and the Doheny Eye Institute. USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the nationally acclaimed <a>Children's Hospital Los Angeles</a>. The health sciences campus is also home to several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, <a>Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute</a>, Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.</p>
<h3>Former agricultural college campus</h3>
<p><a>Chaffey College</a> was founded in 1883 in the city of <a>Ontario, California</a>, as an agricultural college <a>branch campus</a> of USC under the name of Chaffey College of Agriculture of the University of Southern California. USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906 the school was reopened by municipal and regional government and officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a <a>junior college</a> as part of the <a>California Community College System</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Bovard Hall, home of USC's central administration, shortly after completion in 1921; the streets later became pedestrian-only</a> USC is a private <a>corporation</a> controlled by a <a>Board of Trustees</a> composed of 50 voting members and several life trustees, honorary trustees, and trustees <a>emeriti</a> who do not vote. Voting members of the Board of Trustees are elected for five-year terms. One fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election. Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.</p>
<p>The university administration consists of a president, a <a>provost</a>, several vice-presidents of various departments, a treasurer, a <a>chief information officer</a>, and an <a>athletic director</a>. The current president is <a>C. L. Max Nikias</a>. In 2008, Nikias' predecessor, Steven Sample, was one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a salary of $1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the Graduate School, and the 17 professional schools are each led by an academic <a>dean</a>. USC occasionally awards emeritus titles to former administrators. There are currently six administrators emeriti.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California's 17 professional schools include the <a>USC Leventhal School of Accounting</a>, <a>USC School of Architecture</a>, <a>USC Marshall School of Business</a>, <a>USC School of Cinematic Arts</a>, <a>USC Annenberg School for Communication</a>, <a>USC School of Dentistry</a>, <a>USC Rossier School of Education</a>, <a>USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, <a>USC Roski School of Fine Arts</a>, <a>USC Davis School of Gerontology</a>, <a>USC Gould School of Law</a>, <a>Keck School of Medicine of USC</a>, <a>USC Thornton School of Music</a>, <a>USC School of Pharmacy</a>, USC <a>School of Policy, Planning, and Development</a>, <a>USC School of Social Work</a>, and <a>USC School of Theatre</a>.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|USC Gwynn Wilson Student Union.</a></p>
<p>The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) makes decisions representing the students of the university. It consists of an appointed executive leadership board, popularly-elected legislative branch, and judicial oversight, along with a programming board (commonly referred to as &quot;Program Board&quot;). All USG activities are funded by the student activity fee, which the Treasurer has control over setting and that the Senate approves. In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the University Residential Student Community (URSC), which is divided by residence hall. The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) consists of sentators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>[[Image:USC Law.jpg|thumb|right|The Law School building is one of the handful of examples of [[Brutalist architecture]] on the main campus.]]</p>
<p>USC is a large, primarily residential research university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt; The majority of the student body was undergraduate until 2007, when graduate student enrollment began to exceed undergraduate.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The four-year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified as &quot;balanced arts &amp; sciences/professions&quot; with a high graduate coexistence. Admissions are characterized as &quot;more selective, higher transfer in&quot;; 95 undergraduate majors and 147 academic and professional minors are offered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt; The graduate program is classified as &quot;comprehensive&quot; and offers 134 master's, doctoral, and professional degrees through 17 professional schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt; USC is accredited by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USC's academic departments fall either under the general <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>science</a>s of the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences for undergraduates, the Graduate School for graduates, or the university's 17 professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p><a>left|thumb|Mudd Hall of Philosophy</a></p>
<p>The College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the oldest and largest of the USC schools, grants undergraduate degrees in more than 130 majors and minors across the humanities, social sciences, and natural/physical sciences, and offers doctoral and masters programs in more than 20 fields.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USC College is responsible for the general education program for all USC undergraduates, and houses a full-time faculty of approximately 700, more than 6500 undergraduate majors (roughly half the total USC undergraduate population), and 1200 doctoral students. In addition to 30 academic departments, the College also houses dozens of research centers and institutes. In 2007, Howard Gillman, Professor of Political Science, History, and Law, was appointed the 20th Dean of the College. In the 2008-2009 academic year, 4,400 undergraduate degrees and 5,500 advanced degrees were awarded. All Ph.D. degrees awarded at USC and most masters degrees are under the jurisdiction of the Graduate School.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Professional degrees are awarded by each of the respective professional schools. <a>right|thumb|The George Lucas Building, former center of the School of Cinematic Arts</a> The School of Cinematic Arts, the oldest and largest film school in the country, confers degrees in six different programs.&lt;ref name=LATcntv&gt;Rachel Abramowitz, [<a>http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,1,4653236.story</a>], <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. Retrieved June 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt; As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the film school added an <a>Interactive Media Division</a> studying stereoscopic cinema, panoramic cinema, immersive cinema, interactive cinema, video games, virtual reality, and <a>mobile</a> media. In September 2006, George Lucas donated $175 million to expand the film school, the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million). The donation will be used to build new structures and expand the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A Department of Architecture was established at USC within the <a>Roski School of Fine Arts</a> in 1916, the first in <a>Southern California</a>. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as <a>Richard Neutra</a>, Ralph Knowles, James Steele, <a>A. Quincy Jones</a>, <a>William Pereira</a> and <a>Pierre Koenig</a>. The school of architecture can also claim notable alumni <a>Frank Gehry</a>, <a>Jon Jerde</a>, <a>Thom Mayne</a>, <a>Raphael Soriano</a>, <a>Gregory Ain</a>, and <a>Pierre Koenig</a>. Two of the alumni have become <a>Pritzker Prize</a> winners. In 2006, <a>Qingyun Ma</a>, a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>The <a>Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering</a> is headed by Dean <a>Yannis Yortsos</a>. Previously known as the USC School of Engineering, it was renamed on March 2, 2004, as the Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering in honor of <a>Qualcomm</a> co-founder <a>Andrew Viterbi</a> and his wife Erna, who had donated $52 million to the school.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Annenberg School of Communication</a> The <a>Annenberg School for Communication</a>, founded in 1971 is one of the two communication programs in the country endowed by <a>Walter Annenberg</a> (the other is at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>). The School of Journalism, which became part of the School for Communication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; features a core curriculum that requires students to devote themselves equally to print, broadcast and online media for the first year of study. USC's Annenberg School for Communication endowment rose from $7.5 million to $218 million between 1996 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>USC collaborated with <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> to offer the USC (Executive) EMBA program in <a>Shanghai</a>. USC also operates two international study centers in Paris and Madrid. Beginning in 2006, the <a>Marshall School of Business</a> will have a <a>San Diego</a> satellite campus. In May 2006, USC's Board of Trustees and administration traveled to <a>China</a>. to announce the establishment of the <a>USC U.S.-China Institute (USCI)</a> joint research institute on U.S&ndash;China relations and trends in China. USCI has funded research into a variety of topics including the history of U.S.&ndash;China diplomatic exchanges, aging, property rights, environmental challenges, agricultural policy, new media, migration, and technology exchange.</p>
<h3>University library system</h3>
<p> <a>right|thumb|The first true library was housed in the College of Liberal Arts Building (&quot;Old College&quot;), which was built in 1884, and designed to hold the entire USC student body&#x2014;55 students. Two wings were added to the original building in 1905.</a></p>
<p>The USC Libraries are among the oldest private academic research libraries in <a>California</a>. For more than a century USC has been building collections in support of the university's teaching and research interests. Especially noteworthy collections include <a>American literature</a>, Cinema-Television including the <a>Warner Bros.</a> studio archives, <a>Europe</a>an <a>philosophy</a>, <a>gerontology</a>, <a>German</a> exile literature, <a>international relations</a>, <a>Korean studies</a>, studies of <a>Latin America</a>, <a>natural history</a>, <a>Southern California</a> history, and the University Archives. </p>
<p>The USC Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to the University of Southern California&#x2019;s School of Cinematic Arts, by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio&#x2019;s first major feature, <em>My Four Years in Germany</em> (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968. </p>
<p>Announced in June 2006, the testimonies of 52,000 survivors, rescuers and others involved in the <a>Holocaust</a> will now be housed in the USC College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences as a part of the newly formed <a>USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/...1029410.shtml</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|The Galen Center, home of USC basketball and volleyball</a> The USC Trojans participate in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I (FBS)</a> <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> and has won 114 total team national championships (non-NCAA and NCAA): 91 for men and 23 for women. Of this total, 78 and 14 are <a>NCAA</a> National Championships for men and women, respectively. The NCAA does not include <a>college football</a> championships in its calculation. Though there are multiple organizations that name national championships, USC claims 11 football championships. Excluding football, USC men's teams have combined for 78 NCAA championships. The women have won 14, all since 1976. The men's 296 Individual Championships are best in the nation and 50 ahead of second place <a>Michigan</a>. USC's cross-town rival is <a>UCLA</a>, with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. USC's rivalry with <a>Notre Dame</a>&mdash;generally limited to football&mdash;predates the <a>UCLA rivalry</a> by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual <a>football</a> game played between these two universities and is considered one of the greatest rivalries in college athletics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>USC has won 78 NCAA team championships, 3rd behind cross-town rival UCLA (106) and Stanford (97). The Trojans have also won at least one national team title in 26 consecutive years (1959-60 to 1984-85). USC won the National College All-Sports Championship, an annual ranking by <a>USA Today</a> of the country&#x2019;s top athletic programs, 6 times since its inception in 1971. Four Trojans have won the <a>James E. Sullivan Award</a> as the top amateur athlete in America: diver <a>Sammy Lee</a> (1953), shot putter <a>Parry O'Brien</a> (1959), swimmer <a>John Naber</a> (1977) and swimmer <a>Janet Evans</a> (1989).</p>
<p>From the 1904 <a>Summer Olympics</a> through the 2004 games, 375 Trojan athletes have competed in the Games, taking home 112 <a>gold medals</a>, 64 <a>silver</a> and 58 <a>bronze</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt; If it were an independent country, USC would be ranked <a>12th in the world</a> in terms of medals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1912, USC is the only university in the world to have a gold medal-winning athlete in every summer Olympiad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Men's sports</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during a USC football game</a></p>
<p>In men's sports, Trojan teams have won 91 national championships (78 NCAA titles), more than any other school, and male athletes have won more individual NCAA titles (296), also a record.  The Trojans have won 26 championships in <a>track and field</a>, 18 in <a>tennis</a>, 11 in <a>football</a>, 12 in <a>baseball</a>, 9 in <a>swimming</a> and <a>diving</a>,  6 in <a>volleyball</a>, 6 in <a>water polo</a>, 2 in indoor track and field, and 1 in <a>gymnastics</a>.  USC's men's basketball has appeared in the NCAA tournament 15 times, and made 2 NCAA Final Four appearances.</p>
<p>The USC football program has consistently ranked among the best in college athletics in recent years. During the term of <a>Pete Carroll</a> as head coach, the Trojans improved their rankings and competed in a variety of championships. <a>USC Trojans football</a> team has won 11 national championships and 6 players have won the <a>Heisman Trophy</a>. Following its investigation of the USC football program, the NCAA issued sanctions in 2010 that vacated USC's BCS national championship for 2005 (although the school retained the AP national championship from that year), reduced the number of scholarships awarded to student athletes, and made USC ineligible for bowl games for two years. Reggie Bush, one of USC's Heisman Trophy awardees, returned his trophy and the Heisman Trust did not re-award it to another player.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Traditions: USC National Titles</a>, USCTrojans.com, <em>Accessed March 22, 2008.</em>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Heisman Winners (By Year)</a>, Heisman.com, <em>Accessed March 22, 2008.</em>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=ys-uscpenalties061010</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; USC has appealed the sanctions.</p>
<h3>Women's sports</h3>
<p>Women's teams have earned 23 national championships. The Women of Troy have brought home 51 individual NCAA crowns. Two Women of Troy athletes have won the <a>Honda-Broderick Cup</a> as the top collegiate woman athlete of the year: <a>Cheryl Miller</a> (1983&#x2013;84) and <a>Angela Williams</a> (2001&#x2013;02). And Trojan women have won 8 Honda Awards, as the top female athlete in their sport. </p>
<p>The Women of Troy have won 7 championships in <a>Tennis</a>, 6 in <a>volleyball</a>, 3 in <a>water polo</a>, 2 in <a>golf</a>, 2 in <a>Basketball</a>, 1 in <a>swimming</a> and <a>diving</a>, 1 in <a>track and field</a>, and 1 in <a>soccer</a>.</p>
<h2>Traditions and student activities</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|USC mascot Traveler with Trojan Warrior and The Spirit of Troy.</a>  As one of the oldest universities in California, the University of Southern California has a long and storied history resulting in a number of modern traditions, some of which are outlined here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>USC's official <a>fight song</a> is &quot;<a>Fight On</a>,&quot; which was composed in 1922 by USC dental student Milo Sweet (with lyrics by Sweet and Glen Grant).</li>
  <li>Primal SCream: Every night before a final in the fall and spring semester, the USC Band performs outside of Leavey Library at 10:00 to give students a 20-minute break filled with music, dancing, cheering, and even swimming in the reflection pool. On the night before the last day of finals, everyone from students to band members jumps in the reflection pool and celebrate the end of the semester.</li>
  <li>Spectators walking from campus to the <a>Coliseum</a> back-kick the base of one of the flag poles at the edge of campus on Exposition Boulevard to ensure good luck for the football team at their next game.</li>
  <li>TroyCamp is USC's primary charity that serves children from the community in numerous ways. Songfest is an annual event on campus that showcases student talent and benefits the charity. Most fraternities and sororities &quot;team up&quot; to perform in the show.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p>[[Image:120107-LA-USC-UCLA02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|During the week prior to the traditional USC-UCLA rivalry football game, the [[Tommy Trojan]] statue is covered to prevent UCLA vandalism.]]  </p>
<p>USC has rivalries with multiple schools. Though generally limited to football, USC has a major rivalry with <a>Notre Dame</a>. The annual game is played for the <a>Jeweled Shillelagh</a>.  The rivalry has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have kept the annual game on their schedules since 1926 (except 1942&ndash;44 because of World War II travel restrictions) and the game is often referred to as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.&lt;ref name=SI101305&gt;John Walters, <a>Does it get any better than this?</a>, SI.com, October 13, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN112406&gt;Dave Revsine, <a>Michigan, Ohio State set bar high for other rivalries</a>, ESPN.com, November 24, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI101205&gt;<a>The Greatest Intersectional Rivalry: Top 10 Moments from Notre Dame-USC</a>, SI.com, October 12, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT102007&gt;Adam Rose, <a>The Color of Misery</a>, LATimes.com, October 20, 2007, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAC112006&gt;<a>This Week in Pac-10 Football</a>, Pacific-10 Conference, November 20, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>USC's cross-town rival is UCLA, with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. Both are within L.A. city limits, approximately  apart. Until 1982 the two schools also shared the same football stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  The victor of the annual football game takes home the <a>Victory Bell</a>.  The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the <a>Lexus Gauntlet Trophy</a>.  Pranks between <a>UCLA</a> and USC were commonplace several decades ago. Both universities have cracked down on pranks since a 1989 incident when USC students released hundreds of <a>crickets</a> into the <a>main UCLA library</a> during finals week.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Days before a clash between rivals <a>UCLA</a> and USC in 2009, the Bruins mascot was vandalized. It was splashed in cardinal and gold paint, USC's official colors sparking memories of pranks played in the years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The week preceding the annual football matchup with UCLA is known as &quot;Troy Week&quot; and features a number of traditions including CONQUEST! &quot;The Ultimate Trojan Experience&quot;, Save Tommy Night, the CONQUEST! Bonfire, and all-night vigils by the <a>Trojan Knights</a> to protect the campus from <a>UCLA Bruins</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, USC has rivalries with other Pac-10 schools,</p>
<h3>Mascots</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Statue of unofficial mascot George Tirebiter</a> Traveler, a white <a>Andalusian horse</a>, is currently the university's official mascot. It first appeared at a football game in 1961, and was known at Traveler I. The current horse is known as Traveler VII.</p>
<p><a>Tommy Trojan</a>, officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a <a>Trojan</a> warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players, and the statue is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, <a>George Tirebiter</a>, a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. After it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins, it gained fame among students. The dog was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, a few others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.</p>
<h3>Marching band</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The drum major of the Spirit of Troy wears a more elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword.</a> USC's <a>marching band</a>, known as <a>The Spirit of Troy</a>, has been featured in at least 10 major <a>movie</a>s, performed in the <a>1932</a> and <a>1984 Summer Olympics</a> in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  They have also performed on television shows and with other musicians.</p>
<p>The band performed on the title track of the <a>1979</a> <a>Fleetwood Mac</a> album <em><a>Tusk</a>,</em> which went on to be a <a>multi-platinum record</a>.

<h3>Spirit groups</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Song Girls celebrating a USC Trojans football victory</a> Founded in 1967, the USC Song Girls appear at all football, basketball, and volleyball games as well as rallies, university and alumni functions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike other college cheer teams, Song Girls are primarily a dance squad and do not perform gymnastics, stunts or lead cheers.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1919, the USC Yell Leaders worked closely with The Spirit of Troy (USC Band) and the Song Girls to lead cheers and perform stunts to rally Trojan fans at football, basketball, and volleyball games. The sweater-clad team consisted of all men for most of its existence, though the squad later opened itself up to applicants from both sexes and did feature one female Yell Leader in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  They were disbanded by the University after the 2005-06 season and replaced by the co-ed Spirit Leaders.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Spirit Leaders lead chants and motivate the crowds during Trojan football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, soccer, and baseball games and, like the Song Girls, travel with the team to post-season events such as bowl games and the NCAA Basketball Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p>The <em><a>Daily Trojan</a></em> has been the student <a>newspaper</a> of USC since 1912 and is a primary source of news and information for the campus. It secured the first interview of President <a>Richard Nixon</a> after his resignation. The publication does not receive financial aid from the university and instead runs entirely on advertisement revenue. Published from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters, the newspaper turns into the Summer Trojan during the summer term and publishes once a week. It is the paper of record on campus.</p>

<p><em>El Rodeo</em> is USC's student-run <a>yearbook</a>. One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called <em>The Sybil</em>. The name was changed to <em>El Rodeo</em> in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a &quot;roundup&quot; of the year's events. It was long packaged with the Student Activity Card, which gave students access to all home sports games. Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>The <a>Greek Community</a>, making up approximately a fifth of the student body, has had a long and influential history on the campus. Centered on a portion of West 28th Street known as &quot;The Row&quot;, located between <a>Figueroa Street</a> and Hoover Street just north of campus, USC's Greek system began soon after the school's founding when Kappa Alpha Theta founded a chapter in 1887.</p>
<p>With 23 fraternities and 11 sororities in the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and <a>Panhellenic</a> Council (PHC), respectively, the USC Greek community has over 2,650 members and is one of the largest on the West Coast. It regularly participates in Homecoming and Songfest, and the community's philanthropic efforts and success in philanthropic leadership annually raise over $150,000.</p>
<p>Outside of the Panhellenic and Interfraternal councils, the Greek community at USC is very diverse, boasting the Multicultural, Asian, Inter-Fraternity (composed of professional fraternities), and National Panhellenic (historically black) Greek Councils. Organizations governed by these councils include chapters of some of the oldest Latino and Black Greek organizations in the country, the oldest Asian fraternity in Southern California, professional business, engineering, and pre-law fraternities and multiculturally based organizations that range from 5 to over 60 years old.</p>

<p> <strong>b.</strong>  These other names include <strong>SC</strong>, <strong>Southern California</strong>, and <strong>Southern Cal</strong>. Despite its prevalent use in sports-related articles, the official position of USC discourages use of &quot;Southern Cal&quot; in any context, as clearly stated in all <a>media guide</a>s: &quot;Note to the media: In editorial references to athletic teams of the University of Southern California, the following are preferred: USC, Southern California, So. California, Troy and Trojans for men&#x2019;s or women&#x2019;s teams, and Women of Troy for women&#x2019;s teams. PLEASE do not use Southern Cal (it&#x2019;s like calling San Francisco 'Frisco' or North Carolina 'North Car.'). The usage of 'Southern Cal' on licensed apparel and merchandise is limited in scope and necessary to protect federal <a>trademark</a> rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=notsoutherncal&gt;<a>It&#x2019;s Not &#x2018;Southern Cal&#x2019;</a>, <em>2005 USC Football Media Guide</em>, USC Athletic Department, pg. 3.; For registered trademarks, see <a>USPTO serial numbers</a>: 74094678, 73770650, and 73755082.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
