<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|West Ham Technical Institute (November 1898)</a></p>
<p>The institution was formed in 1970 as merger of <a>higher education</a> colleges, including the <strong>West Ham Technical Institute</strong> in Stratford, and the <strong>South East Essex Technical College</strong> in <a>Barking</a>. It was initially known as the <strong>North East London Polytechnic</strong>, and changed its name to the <strong>Polytechnic of East London</strong> in 1989.</em></p>
<h3>West Ham Technical Institute</h3>
<p>West Ham Technical Institute opened in 1898 and taught art, engineering, and science. The Institute also included a women's department. It provided <a>apprenticeship</a> classes and its science and engineering courses were accepted by the <a>University of London</a> for internal degrees.  In 1921, it was renamed the <em>municipal college</em> and became known as the <strong>West Ham College of Technology</strong>. </p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|UEL Stratford Campus</a></p>
<p>The university is located on two main campuses in east London. The <a>Stratford Campus</a> is in the centre of <a>Stratford</a>, close to the 2012 Olympic Park. It is centred around University House, a 19th century listed building. The campus is home to the School of Distance and E-Learning, the Sir John Cass School of Education (which moved into its new centre in 2009), and the Schools of Health &amp; Bioscience and Psychology. The School of Law is based at nearby Duncan House. In January 2008 the Centre for Clinical Education in Podiatry, Physiotherapy and Sports Science was opened by <a>Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall</a>. Operating in partnership with the <a>NHS</a>, the centre is London's only provider of podiatric education. </p>
<p><a>right|thumb|UEL Docklands Campus, The Square</a></p>
<p>The <a>Docklands Campus</a> is in London's redeveloped <a>Docklands</a> area. It is located on the <a>Royal Albert Dock</a> waterfront, overlooking the <a>London City Airport</a> runway. The campus houses the University of East London's student accommodation. It is connected directly to Cyprus <a>DLR</a> station. Docklands was London's first new university campus to be built in over half a century and was opened by the then <a>Mayor of London</a>, Ken Livingstone. UEL's new Business School and Knowledge Dock centre were opened by HM <a>The Queen</a> in February 2007. The Business School will incorporate the Petchey Centre for Entrepreneurship, named in honour of its benefactor, entrepreneur <a>Jack Petchey</a>.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|UEL Docklands Campus, Halls of Residence</a></p>
<p>UEL also delivers a range of programmes and short courses at the <a>Barking Learning Centre</a> in the <a>London Borough of Barking and Dagenham</a>.</p>
<p>Off-campus, over 2,000 students are registered on programmes with UK collaborative partners, principally London's  <a>Tavistock Clinic</a>, and 1,240 on programmes with partners located overseas, such as the Centro Studi Martha Harris in <a>Florence</a>.</p>
<h3>London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games</h3>
<p>The University of East London's Docklands Campus has been selected by the <a>United States Olympic team</a> as their base before and during the London 2012 Olympic Games. More than 1,000 competitors, coaches and medical staff will use UEL campuses in the Docklands and Stratford in east London, near the Olympic Park. The athletes will also use UEL's halls of residence and set up a medical and media centre at the campus.</p>
<h3>Development projects</h3>
<p>A &#x00a3;21 million sports and leisure complex is scheduled to open at the Docklands Campus early 2012, provisionally named the Sports Dock.  The centre includes a large indoor sports arena, ten badminton courts, two competition basketball, volleyball and netball courts, two five a side football pitches, a gym and fitness suite and covered seating for 400 people. The leisure complex is currently under construction.</p>
<p>The university is also in talks to establish a specialist sports faculty at the Olympic Stadium after 2012. A tenancy will be proposed to the Olympic Park Legacy Company. UEL proposes to teach sports-related degrees to up to 600 undergraduates in lecture halls in the venue's undercroft.</p>
<p>Planning permission has been granted to a collaborative project in Stratford between the University of East London and Birkbeck, University of London.  The proposed new education building will provide shared teaching facilities for both higher education institutions and their partners, which will include Newham Sixth Form College.</p>
<p>The Stratford Island University Centre (a working title for the building) will house a range of departments from each university and incorporate a range of flexible teaching and administrative spaces, alongside dedicated spaces for subjects including Law, Performing Arts, Dance, Music and Information Technology. </p>
<p>A number of social and environmentally sustainable measures are to be incorporated; the site will have a landscaped learning garden and proposals include green roofs and photovoltaic panels. Work on site is likely to commence in August 2011 with the building completed and operational for the start of the academic term in autumn 2013.</p>
<h2>Academic structure</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|UEL Student Housing Looking Towards Canary Wharf</a></p>
<p>Degree programmes and other courses at are taught at UEL by one of eight schools at the University, listed below. In addition, there are three schools that carry out administrative roles within the academic structure: the School of Combined Honours, the Graduate School, and UELconnect which manages Distance &amp; E-learning and Short Courses.</p>
<ul>
  <li>School of Architecture &amp; the Visual Arts</li>
  <li>School of Computing, Information Technology and Engineering</li>
  <li>Royal Docks Business School</li>
  <li>Cass School of Education</li>
  <li>School of Health and Bioscience</li>
  <li>School of Law</li>
  <li>School of Psychology</li>
  <li>School of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences</li>
</ul>
<h3>Degrees</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Library Building at The Stratford Campus</a></p>
<p>UEL offers both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Undergraduate degrees can be either Single Honours or Combined Honours degrees, most of which are available for study on either a full-time or part-time basis. With a [[Combined Honours degree, a student may choose to study two different subjects in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Major/Minor combinations, where the student spends two-thirds of their time studying one subject and the remaining third on another. The award would be for example, BA (Hons) History with English Literature</li>
  <li>Joint combinations where two subjects are studied equally. The award would be for example, BA (Hons) History and English Literature</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Extended Degree Programmes are available for many of the Single Honour programmes, a route popular for students without appropriate A-Level qualifications for their degree of choice. By taking an Extended Degree programme, students add a preliminary foundation year to the otherwise typically three-year programme to bring them up to speed and secure the knowledge and skills necessary to see out the remainder of the course.</p>
<p>UEL also offers a wide range of postgraduate degrees, including taught master's degrees, professional doctorates (which offer the title Dr but contain a significant taught element at advanced level, rather than being purely research based) and research degrees including MPhils and PhDs.</p>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|University Square, Docklands Campus</a></p>
<p>On 21 November 2006, the UEL/<a>Birkbeck, University of London</a> Partnership at Stratford was launched when a memorandum of understanding between the two institutions was signed by the Master of Birkbeck, Professor David Latchman, and the then Vice-Chancellor of UEL, Professor Mike Thorne. The partnership aims to improve participation in higher education in east London by attracting new students who would not otherwise participate through the provision of new opportunities and progression pathways.</p>
<p>Birkbeck was awarded nearly &#x00a3;5m in April 2006 by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE) to take its flexible, evening teaching provision to east London, which has the lowest higher education participation levels in the London region. Birkbeck courses have been offered at the Stratford campus of UEL since September 2007 as part of the Birkbeck strand of the new partnership, now called Birkbeck Stratford.</p>
<p>UEL have a MBA program in Malaysia via corroboration with Women's Institute Of Management Malaysia.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>According to the results of the most recent government research assessment exercise, UEL is among the top ten post-1992 universities in the UK for research.</p>
<p>In the case of Sociology, Art and Design and Cultural and Innovation Studies, a majority of staff research was recognised by the 2001 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> as &quot;world class&quot;.</p>
<h3>Study Abroad Programmes</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Stratford Campus</a></p>

UEL's commitment to widening access and regional development, in an area of England with a traditionally very low uptake of higher education, allied to multi-million-pound investment in campuses and facilities,  has student numbers grow from 12,000 to over 23,000 in the last since 2002.</p>
<p>The university's Civil Engineering Department has risen in its ranking according to the Guardian's League table, by moving from 8th position in 2010 to 5th in 2011.</p>
