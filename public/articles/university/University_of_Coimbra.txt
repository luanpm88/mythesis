<p>The <strong>University of Coimbra (UC)</strong> (, ) is a Portuguese <a>public university</a> in <a>Coimbra</a>, <a>Portugal</a>. It is one of the <a>oldest universities in continuous operation</a> in Europe and the world, the oldest <a>university</a> of Portugal, and one of its largest <a>higher education</a> and <a>research</a> institutions. It is organized into eight different <a>faculties</a> according to a wide range of fields, granting all the highest academic degrees in architecture, education, engineering, humanities, law, mathematics, medicine, natural sciences, psychology, social sciences and sports. It is a founding member of the <a>Coimbra Group</a>, a group of leading European research universities, whose inaugural meeting it hosted. The University of Coimbra has approximately 20,000 students, and hosts one of the largest communities of <a>international student</a>s in Portugal, being the most cosmopolitan Portuguese university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded, or ratified, in 1290 by <a>King Dinis</a>, having begun its existence in <a>Lisbon</a> with the name <a>Studium Generale</a> (<em>Estudo Geral</em>). <em>Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis</em>, the royal charter announcing the institution of the University was dated 1 March of that year, although efforts had been made at least since 1288 to create this first University in <a>Portugal</a>; it is thus one the oldest of such establishments in the <a>Iberian Peninsula</a>. The Papal confirmation was also given in 1290 (on 9 August of that year), during the Papacy of the <a>Pope Nicholas IV</a>. In accordance with the Papal Bull, all the &quot;licit&quot; Faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established. Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law and Medicine were the first to be created. <a>left|250px|left|thumb|The old courtyard of the University of Coimbra.</a> It was, however, not to remain in Lisbon for long. In 1308, likely due to problems of emancipation from the Church (relations between the latter and the political power being somewhat strained at the time) and conflicts between the inhabitants of the city and the students, the University moved to <a>Coimbra</a>. This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the <a>Monastery of Santa Cruz</a>. The university was then established on the site known as &quot;Estudos Velhos&quot;, which corresponds roughly to the area where the Main Library now stands.</p>
<p>In 1338, during the reign of <a>Afonso IV</a>, it was once again transferred to Lisbon, from whence it returned in 1354, this time to the centre of the town which was then in full expansion. In 1377, during the reign of <a>King Fernando</a>, it was transferred yet again to Lisbon, where it would remain for over a century and a half. The authorization for a Faculty of Theology probably dates from this period &#x2013; around 1380. [[Image:DinisI-UniCoimbra.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]] statue with the Medicine Faculty in the background.]] In 1537, during the reign of <a>Jo&#x00e3;o III</a>, the university moved definitively to Coimbra, where it was installed in the Alca&#x00e7;ova Palace. The entire university institution, including the teaching staff and all the books from its library, were moved from Lisbon to Coimbra. At the same time, university colleges were created (<a>abolished in the 19th century</a>), a restructuring of the curricula was undertaken and new teachers, both Portuguese and foreign, were admitted.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the <a>Marquis of Pombal</a>, Minister of the kingdom, made radical reforms in the University, especially regarding the teaching of sciences, in accordance to his <a>Enlightenment</a> and anticlerical creed.</p>
<p>During many decades it was the only <a>university</a> in Portugal, since its foundation in 1290 until 1559 (a university in <a>&#x00c9;vora</a> operated between 1559 and 1759), and again between 1759 and 1911 (<a>University of Lisbon</a> and <a>University of Porto</a> were created in 1911). The long history and past predominance of the University of Coimbra made it an important focus of influence in Portugal, not only educational, but also political and social.</p>
<p>Initial steps towards some convergence of European higher education systems were taken with the signature of the <a>Sorbonne declaration</a> by the Ministers in charge of higher education in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, in 1998, and later, in 1999, with the signature of the <a>Bologna declaration</a>. The <a>Bologna process</a>, aimed at creating a <a>European Higher Education Area</a> by implementing a comparable degree structure, common quality assurance standards and by promoting the mobility of students and faculty members, was a major revolution in Europe's higher education. <a>Globalization</a>, technological change and increased international competition for scarce high-skilled labor highlighted the importance of making European higher education institutions attractive and competitive worldwide. A more integrated European Higher Education Market enhanced competition between European universities&#x2014;a necessary condition for producing leading-edge innovations and for catching up with the <a>US economy</a>. In Portugal, the University of Coimbra decided to defer the adoption of the new <a>Bologna Process</a> model from 2006 to 2007/2008 (with exceptions authorized for a few programs on which a national consensus for change had been reached among institutions) in order to make the transition maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity. Only in the 2008/2009 school year did the entire university fully adopt the new programs within its 8 <a>faculties</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><a>Central building of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra in the <em>P&#x00f3;lo II</em> campus.|200px|thumb|right</a> The University's governance is assured by the <a>Rector</a>, Senate and University Assembly, the latter responsible for the election of the Rector and members of Senate. The Rector has the main responsibility for the strategic direction and overall administration of the University together with the Senate and assisted by the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>The University of Coimbra is divided in eight different <a>faculties</a> (Letters, Law, Medicine, Sciences &amp; Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology &amp; Education Sciences and Sports Sciences &amp; Physical Education), comprising about 20,000 students. The Faculty of Sciences and Technology (FCTUC) is the largest by number of professors and students, awards the highest number of academic degrees, and manages more classrooms and research units than any other in the UC. Both the <a>Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal</a>, an organization under direct supervision of the Portuguese Ministry of the Justice, which provides <a>forensic science</a> services to the police forces and government agencies of Portugal, and the University of Coimbra's <a>teaching hospital</a>, HUC (<em><a>Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra</a></em>), a <a>university hospital</a> known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties, are managed by the Faculty of Medicine (FMUC).</p>
<p>The university harbours a huge central library (<a>University of Coimbra General Library</a>), botanical gardens (<a>Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra</a>), stadiums and other sports facilities (<em><a>Est&#x00e1;dio Universit&#x00e1;rio de Coimbra</a></em> sports complex and <em>Campo de Santa Cruz</em> stadium), an astronomical observatory, a publishing house, a private <a>chapel</a> (<a>S&#x00e3;o Miguel Chapel</a>), a theatre (Teatro Acad&#x00e9;mico de Gil Vicente), and many support facilities such as dining halls and studying rooms. In addition, the university manages several <a>museums</a> and other cultural organizations, including a <a>science</a> museum (<a>Science Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>), a museum of <a>sacred art</a> (<a>Sacred Art Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>), and an academic museum (<a>Academic Museum of the University of Coimbra</a>).</p>
<p>The university has five main campuses or other sites:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>P&#x00f3;lo I</em> (the monumental ancient university core centre, with the main library and administration services, as well as facilities of law, medicine, letters, psychology, and natural sciences departments &#x2013; active since the early university times before the 16th century, with major expansions in the 18th century and from the 1940s to the 1960s, during <a>Estado Novo</a>)</li>
  <li><em>P&#x00f3;lo II</em> (engineering, sciences &amp; technology &#x2013; built during the 1990s and 2000s)</li>
  <li><em>P&#x00f3;lo III</em> (medicine, pharmacy &amp; the <a>university hospital</a> &#x2013; built in the 1980s with major expansions in the 2000s)</li>
  <li><em>Faculdade de Economia</em> (economics, social sciences &#x2013; founded in the 1970s)</li>
  <li><em>Faculdade de Ci&#x00ea;ncias do Desporto e Educa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o F&#x00ed;sica</em> (sports sciences &#x2013; founded in the late 1990s in the <a>university sports complex</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p> Students are represented by the students' union <a>Associa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o Acad&#x00e9;mica de Coimbra</a> (AAC). Formed on 3 November 1887, it is the oldest university students' union in Portugal, with a long history of struggle against unpopular state policies, forming notable politicians and intellectuals along the way. It also harbours a very dynamic associative life, with its numerous  sports and cultural sections, as well as a number of other autonomous organizations.  It is an important structure of extracurricular formation of the University of Coimbra's students and a major institution of the city itself. The AAC develops activities such as theatre, cinema, radio and television broadcast, music, choral singing, journalism or philately, as well as rowing, athletics and many other sports. Every student, and occasionally some non-students, are entitled to belong to these sections.</p>
<h2>Culture, sports and traditions</h2>
<p> Closely related with this old university are many academic traditions and institutions with a strong impact on the city's life. The old &quot;Republics&quot; (autonomous students' residences) remain, as well as some traditional festivities, most notably the &quot;<a>Queima das Fitas</a>&quot; (a celebration of graduation's end, symbolized by the burning of the ribbons with the colors of each of the eight faculties), the &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; (a <a>homecoming</a>), the frequent use of traditional attire, the &quot;<a>Fado de Coimbra</a>&quot; (Coimbra's <a>fado</a>, now sung in organized shows rather than the traditional street serenades), and the academic ceremonies (namely the conferring of doctorate degrees). <a>right|200px|thumb|Larga Street at the University of Coimbra.</a> The official colors of each one of the Faculties of the University of Coimbra are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty of Law: Red</li>
  <li>Faculty of Medicine: Yellow</li>
  <li>Faculty of Letters: Dark Blue</li>
  <li>Faculty of Sciences &amp; Technology: Light Blue and White</li>
  <li>Faculty of Pharmacy: Purple</li>
  <li>Faculty of Economics: Red and White</li>
  <li>Faculty of Psychology &amp; Education Sciences: Orange</li>
  <li>Faculty of Sports Sciences &amp; Physical Education: Brown</li>
</ul>
<p>These colors are used in the institutional seal and other symbols of each faculty, in the university ceremonies conferring doctorate degrees, and are also used by the students in their ribbons related with the academic traditions (see <a>Queima das Fitas</a> <em>(The Burning of the Ribbons)</em>). The color of the university seal and of the Rector's office, representing the entire institution as a whole, is dark green. The flag of the University of Coimbra (white flag with the dark green seal in the middle) is always erected, over the top of the old university tower, on the 1st of March, which is the day of the university, being an occasion for a week of debates, conferences, workshops, and special events related with multiple aspects of the institution. [[Image:Assoc Acad Coimbra logo.png|200 px|thumb|The students' union of the university is the [[Associa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o Acad&#x00e9;mica de Coimbra|AAC]].]] <a>right|200px|thumb|Coimbra's Queima das Fitas Parade. Image depicting nearly-graduated students of the Faculty of Medicine.</a> The <strong><a>Praxe</a></strong> is a body of ritual and custom founded upon ancient traditions and it is an important part of Coimbra's academic life which no university student is indifferent to. Part of the attraction of Coimbra's academic life, aside from its recognized excellence is that it is more <em>Praxe</em>, having unique rituals that set it apart from other institutions and give its students a special sense of participation in academic rituals originating hundreds of years ago. Though these rituals are seen as outdated by some, it remains an important reference in the academic experience of the University of Coimbra's students. The rules of the <em>Praxe</em> are contained in a book (The Code of Academic Praxe, by a committee of older students of the AAC &#x2013; <a>Associa&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o Acad&#x00e9;mica de Coimbra</a>), which defines appropriate student behavior for activities like drafting, evaluation, groups or bands and the Burning of the Ribbons rituals. Even inside the <a>AAC</a>, as a modern and democratic students organisation, there are <em>anti-Praxe</em> groups and people who claims for deeper reforms in tradition rituals. The Freshman (1st yr.) period (naturally, the lowest category in the <em>Praxe</em> hierarchy) is for most students a time of good and lasting memories of never to be repeated events. All of academic life in Coimbra is filled with tradition and ritual and tends to be quite memorable. One of the most visible and distinctive traditions is the use of the academic costume of the University of Coimbra, a black suit and cape used on special occasions by the students and which was adopted by other Portuguese universities and is actually used by students of almost all higher education institutions in the city and across the country.</p>
<p>Praxis almost disappeared in the years after the <a>25 de Abril revolution</a> of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In the days of old it was common usage, that the student would wear for the whole length of his studies. Many students slept in it, wine undermining their efforts to reach home. The cape would get to the end of studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend. Today the academic attire is a ceremonial dress to use in formal students ceremonial. It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of the ages.</p>
<p>A student that enrolled more than the years of his course was a veteran. Through the ages, when University enrollment was a matter of class, some students would accumulate quite a number of enrollments. The individual that had the most, was Dux Veteranorum, a notable figure in the students scene at the University. In the middle 1980s for instance, the Dux Veteranorum had more than 20 enrollments in Law School but had graduated in only 2 or 3 courses. This tradition is disappearing as the University is putting constraints in the number of years a student can enroll. (Most of students costs are paid with public money and it is no longer found acceptable that some individuals strain finances to fool around.)</p>
<p>The sports sections of the <a>AAC</a> play a significant role in Coimbra's sport life, often being the city's main representative in that area. They include rugby, handball, basketball, baseball, martial arts, athletics, gymnastic or swimming, among others. Just as with the cultural sections, every student, including professional or semi-professional athletes, may belong to them.</p>
<p>The city's main <a>football</a> club, usually known as &quot;<a>Acad&#x00e9;mica</a>&quot; or &quot;Briosa&quot;, is in formal terms an autonomous organism of the <a>AAC</a> and is called <a>AAC-OAF</a>, but in practical terms it is an independent club, only loosely connected to its mother institution. It is a relatively important team, especially as regards to its huge number of followers nationwide, and plays in the top Potuguese football leagues, having been the first winner in history of the <a>Portuguese Football Cup</a>, in 1939.</p>
<h3>Recep&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o ao Caloiro</h3>
<p>In Portugal, the <a>homecoming</a> is known as <em>Recep&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o ao Caloiro</em> (The Freshman's Reception). It includes numerous events and traditions born in the 19th century in the University of Coimbra. It is defined as a welcome to the new students, the <a>freshmen</a> (<em>caloiros</em>), and takes place at the beginning of the academic year in Portuguese university towns. In every classic <a>public university of Portugal</a> the homecoming is celebrated yearly. The events are followed in varying degrees by other less traditional or smaller institutions. A street parade of students, concerts, and sports events are always organized for the freshmen's reception. The street parade organized in several major Portuguese universities is known as <em>Latada</em>, and its name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen's legs (the word <em>lata</em> is tin can in Portuguese).</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>&quot;The Freshman's Reception&quot; (<em>Recep&#x00e7;&#x00e3;o ao Caloiro</em>, the Portuguese name for university homecoming) goes back to the 19th century when the law students of the University of Coimbra felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely <a>tin can</a>s, which is the original root of &quot;The Tin Can Parade&quot;. In addition, it has <a>students from 70 different nationalities</a>; almost 10% of its students are foreigners, being among Portugal's most international universities.</p>
<p>The University of Coimbra is among the major science and technology hubs for applied and fundamental research in Portugal. One of the most powerful <a>supercomputer</a>s in Portugal belongs to the University of Coimbra and is managed by the Laboratory for Advanced Computing of the Department of Physics at the University of Coimbra. Built in the mid 2000s, the supercomputer was called <em>Milipeia</em>, using 528 processors and 1000 GB of memory. Its capacity has been expanded since then. The main tasks of the university's supercomputer include modeling and calculus in <a>molecular biology</a>, <a>genetics</a>, <a>particle physics</a>, <a>astrophysics</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>geophysics</a>, <a>condensed matter physics</a>, etc. Besides University of Coimbra's researchers, other Portuguese scientific community members are allowed to work with <em>Milipeia</em>.</p>
<h3>Organisation and length of courses</h3>
<p>School year calendar starts in October and finishes in July. In 2004, it was among the first universities in Portugal limiting the time for degree completion. The degree programmes have a specified minimum and maximum time for completion. The time limit is 6 years from the date of first enrolment for the 4 years degrees, and 8 years from the date of first enrolment for 6 years degrees (i.e. Medicine). After that, students have to pay the entire costs of their courses. The tuition fee for undergraduate degrees was 356&#x20ac;/year in 2002/2003. It was increased to 880&#x20ac;/year in 2004/2005 and to 901,23&#x20ac;/year in 2005/2006, the maximum fee allowed to state universities by law. Even with the time limit and the increased tuition fees, the university has had a high number of applicants every year. Like other universities in Portugal, and unlike the polytechnical institutes and many private universities, the university does not have special classes for workers or night classes. Overcrowded classrooms have been frequent in some disciplines at the Faculties of Science and Technology, Law, and Economics. In those occasions, students may stand during the classes or even stay outside the classroom. These faculties have the highest abandon rate and the biggest average time for degree completion. New buildings, campus expansion and modernized infrastructures since the late 1990s and the 2000s, have solved almost all these problems.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>Admission is strictly merit-based, and the university has several departments which are known for higher-than-average selectiveness. <a>Numerus clausus</a> is applied to select among competing applicants. To such study programmes like those of medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200). Acceptance rates may vary significantly from <a>faculty</a> to faculty or from department to department. Foreign applicants usually make up more than 10 percent of the applicant pool, and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective state of origin or through bilateral protocols between the governments of Portugal and foreign governments. There are also a number of other extraordinary admission processes for older people (admission for candidates older than 23 years old), sportsmen, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (<a>academic transfer</a>), former students (readmission), etc, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each department or faculty.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni and students</h2>
<p> Many historical figures and renowned personalities noted for their activity in fields ranging from politics to culture to the sciences, attended the University of Coimbra as students or lecturers. The long list of personalities includes the only Portuguese <a>Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> <a>Egas Moniz</a>, Portuguese statesman <a>Ant&#x00f3;nio de Oliveira Salazar</a> who was the founder and leader of the regime that presided over the last period of the <a>Portuguese Empire</a> from 1933 to 1974, or famous 16th century mathematicians like <a>Pedro Nunes</a>, who is considered one of the greatest Portuguese mathematicians ever, and the German <a>Christopher Clavius</a>, who was the main architect of the modern <a>Gregorian calendar</a>.</p>
