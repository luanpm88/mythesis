<p><strong>Rose&#x2013;Hulman Institute of Technology</strong> (abbreviated <strong>RHIT</strong>), formerly <strong>Rose Polytechnic Institute</strong>, is a small private <a>college</a> specializing in teaching <a>engineering</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, and <a>science</a>. RHIT is highly regarded for its <a>undergraduate</a> engineering program, which <em>US News and World Reports</em> ranked in 2011 as the best in the <a>United States</a> of schools whose highest degree is a bachelor's or master's degree.  Its  <a>campus</a> is located in <a>Terre Haute</a>, <a>Indiana</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The curricula at RHIT concentrate on engineering and the natural sciences. The school's primary focus is undergraduate education, though there is a small graduate program for master's degree students. There are no doctoral programs. In 2005, Rose-Hulman had 161 faculty members, 99% of whom held a <a>Ph.D.</a> The current student-to-faculty ratio is 12:1. Admission to the institute remains competitive due to its self-selecting admissions class and applicant sharing with <a>MIT</a>, <a>Purdue</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, and other top universities. In 2010, 559 students enrolled out of over 3,800 applicants. The school currently operates on three academic quarters plus an optional summer session.</p>

<h2>History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from <a>Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a> --&gt;</h2>
<p><a>thumb|275px|right|Photograph (circa 1881) of the original main campus building at 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Locust.</a></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>Founder <a>Chauncey Rose</a>, along with nine friends, created the Terre Haute School of Industrial Science in 1874 to provide technical training after encountering difficulties in local engineer availability during construction of his railroads. Mr. Rose donated the land on 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Locust St. and the majority of the funds needed to start the new school. A year later, the cornerstone of the new institution was laid and the name was changed to Rose Polytechnic Institute despite the objections of the president of the board of managers and chief benefactor, Mr. Rose. The original campus was a single building, with no dormitories or recreational facilities.</p>
<p>The first class of 48 students entered in 1883, chosen from 58 applicants. Of the 48 students, all were male, and 37 came from Indiana. All but four students chose to major in <a>Mechanical Engineering</a> with <a>Civil Engineering</a> and <a>Chemistry</a> the only other majors. Nearly half of the original students would eventually quit their studies before graduation for a number of reasons, including poor grades or conduct. The first president was <a>Dr.</a> <a>Charles O. Thompson</a>, who modeled the education of Rose Poly after eastern institutions. Rose Poly was thus founded as the first private engineering college west of the Alleghenies.</p>
<h3>Relocation</h3>
<p>In 1917, the school, having grown to more than 300 students, moved from 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Locust St. (on which now sits Chauncey Rose Middle School) to a new site consisting of  of farm land on U.S. 40 donated by the <a>Hulman</a> family of Terre Haute. The cornerstone of the new campus was laid in 1922. The new campus consisted of an academic building and a dorm - the institute's first.</p>
<p>Early life at Rose consisted of social fraternities, athletics, and the occasional &quot;high jinks.&quot; A popular &quot;high jinks&quot; involved the sophomore class inviting the freshmen class to a baseball game but were told to &quot;leave their pipes with the nurse.&quot; The freshmen would produce the pipes at a specific time and a brawl would ensue.</p>
<h3>Renaming and Logan years</h3>
<p>In recognition of the Hulman family's significant contributions and continued financial support, Rose Polytechnic was renamed Rose&#x2013;Hulman Institute of Technology in 1971.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 70s, growth accelerated under president John A. Logan. Five new residence halls, a new student union, library, and a student recreation center were all constructed between 1963 and 1976. Permission was sought and received to increase the student population to 1000.</p>
<p>The quarterly cryptology journal <a>Cryptologia</a> was founded and published at RHIT from 1977 to 1995, at which time it was moved to the <a>United States Military Academy</a>.</p>
<h3>Hulbert years</h3>
<p>For most of its history, Rose-Hulman was a men's-only institution. It voted to become <a>coeducational</a> in 1991, with the first women students starting in 1995. Also in 1995, the college required all incoming <a>freshmen</a> to purchase <a>laptop computer</a>s, becoming one of the first schools to do so. Since then, laptops have been required for all freshmen, and the <a>curricula</a> have heavily integrated computers into classroom instruction.</p>
<p>In the decade following 1995, Rose-Hulman's growth was aided by a major <a>fundraising</a> campaign called &quot;Vision to be the Best.&quot; Originally a $100 million campaign over ten years, it met its goal in half the time. The goal was extended to $200 million, and by the end of the campaign in June 2004, over $250 million had been raised. In 2002, Hatfield Hall, a state-of-the-art theater and alumni center was opened. Five years earlier Shook Field House was replaced with the $20 million Sports and Recreation Center, which is a major reason that the <a>National Football League's</a> <a>Indianapolis Colts</a> have used the campus for their summer training camp from 1999-2010.</p>
<h3>John J. Midgley's Tenure</h3>
<p>After the 2004 retirement of institute president <a>Samuel Hulbert</a>, who had led the school since 1976, the college faced a leadership crisis. Soon after <a>John J. Midgley</a> arrived as the new president, rumors of conflict between Midgley and the administration started to circulate. Students, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;, held a rally calling for Midgley's resignation. Dr. Midgley resigned as president of the institute on 11 June 2005, less than a year into his presidency, after the faculty, staff, and Student Government Association approved votes of <a>no confidence</a>. During the succeeding academic year, <a>Robert Bright</a>, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, served as interim chief executive officer.</p>
<h3>Gerald Jakubowski Serves</h3>
<p>At a press conference on 17 March 2006, Mr. Bright named <a>Gerald Jakubowski</a>, Vice President and Professor of Engineering at <a>Arizona State University</a>, as the thirteenth president of the Institute. Dr. Jakubowski took over effective 1 July 2006. Dr. Jakubowski was respectfully referred to as &quot;Dr. J.&quot; by the students and he held meetings with those interested a few times during the year to catch up on campus life. On 23 February 2009, Dr. Jakubowski announced that he would be resigning from the position of president, effective 30 June.</p>
<h3>Current President Matt Branam</h3>
<p>On June 11, 2009, the college announced that the Board of Trustees had elected <a>Matt Branam</a> to serve as interim president. On December 4, 2009, the Board elected Branam as permanent president. Upon election of Branam as interim, Rose-Hulman began a search for a permanent president which had identified a number of impressive potential candidates. &quot;Early in that process, the Trustees became convinced that it was in the institution's best interest to ask Matt Branam, who has been serving in an interim capacity, to become our permanent president,&#x201d; said Board Chairman William Fenoglio.</p>
<p>With his election, Branam became the 14th president in the 135-year history of the college.</p>
<p>Branam brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to Rose-Hulman. His expertise in fundraising, board relations, public relations, brand management, legal, labor, and financial affairs brings Rose-Hulman a seasoned leader. He managed the American Red Cross through a period of tremendous growth and change for its then president, Elizabeth Dole, as its first ever chief operating officer. Branam&#x2019;s experience also includes a distinguished 24-year career with UPS (formerly called United Parcel Service) where his local job as a teenager evolved through numerous positions of increased responsibility, including the position of vice president of public affairs in Washington, D.C. A native of Terre Haute, Ind., Branam has attended Indiana State University, Taylor University and Georgetown University, and he graduated from Rose-Hulman in 1979.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|275px|A view of Percopo Hall (left) and White Chapel.</a> <a>thumb|left|White Chapel at Rose-Hulman.</a></p>
<p>Rose-Hulman's  campus includes a <a>baseball</a> field, a <a>softball</a> field, and a <a>soccer</a> field at the west end, two bodies of water (known on campus as &quot;Scum Pond&quot; and &quot;Speed Lake&quot;) surrounded by residence halls in the middle, the academic buildings east of that, and a row of fraternities further to the east. The Sports and Recreation Center (SRC), Cook Stadium, and other sports-related facilities anchor the north side of campus, and Oakley Observatory sits on the far east edge.</p>
<p>The entrance of the campus leads to Hadley Hall, the main administrative building. The center of campus is marked by the Grace and Anton Hulman Memorial Union, which includes dining facilities and administrative offices, as well as other campus-run businesses such as the bookstore and game room.</p>
<p>Rose-Hulman maintains a safe campus: the crime rate for all of campus is low with only a few incidents reported each year. The Office of Public Safety provides 24-hour security and operates emergency call boxes situated throughout the campus to summon help for emergencies, for the escort service, or to get one's car unlocked to retrieve keys. All of the sidewalks are well-lit, and during winter the stairways and sidewalks are kept clear of snow and ice. <a>thumb|right|White Chapel and fountain at night.</a></p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>There are ten residence halls on campus: Deming, Baur-Sames-Bogart (BSB), Speed, Mees, Scharpenberg, Blumberg, Skinner, Percopo, and the Apartment Style Residence Hall (which consists of Apartments East and Apartments West). Combined, these halls can provide housing for over 1,100 students.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Deming Hall.</a></p>
<p>The oldest, Deming Hall, was built in 1926 and is an all-male hall. Deming houses 109 students, mostly freshmen, on four floors. a Hoosier <a>watercolor</a>ist and illustrator. A 115-piece collection of 19th century <a>British</a> watercolors can be found in the Hulman Memorial Union. The art curator for Rose-Hulman also is in charge of rotating the art collections on the main floors of Moench Hall which are changed during the summer and also over Winter Break. <a>thumb|left|The Self-Made Man sculpture, on display just outside the entrance to the Sports and Recreation Center (SRC).</a></p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The student body tends to come mostly from the <a>Midwest</a> <a>United States</a>, though as the school has gained prominence it has gradually attracted a more geographically and ethnically diverse applicant pool. 39% of students hail from the state of Indiana with large numbers of students from the nearby states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota. A 2003 gift of $7 million from an alumnus was specifically established to increase geographic diversity. International students currently make up about 3% of the student body. Approximately 25% of students are female. A sizable population is involved in <a>Army</a> and <a>Air Force ROTC program</a>s.</p>
<h3>Greek life and honor societies</h3>
<p>There are eight social <a>fraternities</a> and three social <a>sororities</a>, some of which have their houses on campus. The fraternities are: <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a>, <a>Delta Sigma Phi</a>, <a>Lambda Chi Alpha</a>, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Sigma Nu</a>, <a>Theta Xi</a>, and <a>Triangle</a>. The sororities are <a>Delta Delta Delta</a>, <a>Chi Omega</a>, and <a>Alpha Omicron Pi</a>. As of 2003, nearly half of the students were members of Greek social organizations.</p>
<p>Various academic, honor and service organizations are also represented, including <a>Alpha Chi Sigma</a>, <a>Alpha Lambda Delta</a>, <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, <a>Eta Kappa Nu</a>, <a>Pi Mu Epsilon</a>, <a>Pi Tau Sigma</a>, <a>Sigma Pi Sigma</a>, <a>Tau Beta Pi</a> and <a>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>.</p>
<h2>Performing arts</h2>
<p>The performing arts at Rose-Hulman have a wide base of support. There are currently 6 different performing arts groups on campus, Chorus, Drama Club, String Ensemble, Jazz Band, Concert Band, and Pep Band. All of the groups use the recently constructed Hatfield Hall for performances, rehearsal space, and storage. All performing arts groups have been recording CDs for the past couple of years to use as recruiting measures and to show off the talent of the Rose-Hulman students. In addition to these groups, Rose-Hulman also has the Performing Arts Series which brings mainstream acts to Hatfield Hall for the cultural enrichment of both the campus and community. Recent acts have included Diavolo, the Harlem Gospel Choir, and the East Village Opera Company all of whose shows sold out completely in only a few days. This year's Performing Arts Series is expected to be a success with many shows selling out due to the expected popularity of the shows including: Barrage, the Russian National Ballet, and Taikoproject.</p>
<h3>Rose Chorus</h3>
<p>The Rose Chorus performs many times throughout the year including the National Anthem before the Homecoming football game, the Golden Gala dinner during Homecoming weekend, three concerts a year, commencement ceremonies, and either Mom's Day or Dad's Day festivities.</p>
<h3>Rose Drama Club</h3>
<p>The Rose Drama Club performs many times throughout the year including fall and winter plays, a spring musical, a 24-hour play festival (where plays are written, rehearsed, and performed in 24 hours), and one-acts. Recent productions include <em>The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940</em>, <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, <em>Once Upon a Mattress</em>, <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. This years' shows include <em>Noises Off</em> and <em>Curtains</em>. As most Rose students are engineering majors, the drama club prides itself on its technical theater group and their special effects.</p>
<h3>Rose Jazz Band</h3>
<p>The Rose Jazz Band plays different styles of jazz from a jazzy <em>Let it Snow</em> to <em>Tank</em>. The Rose Jazz Band partners with the Chorus, String Ensemble, and Concert Band to put on an excellent Christmas concert.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Athletics logo</a> <a>thumbnail|right|120px|Old logo of RHIT Football Team.</a> There are many facilities for sports events. The Sports and Recreation Center (SRC) is home to <a>basketball</a> courts, <a>racquetball</a> courts, an indoor track, an 8-lane,  swimming and diving pool, a weight-lifting room, a basketball arena (Hulbert Arena), and a multi-use room (for dance, wrestling, etc.). Outside of the SRC is Cook Stadium and its <a>football</a> field surrounded by the William Welch Outdoor Track &amp; Field Complex. Inside of Cook Stadium grandstand is the RHIT rifle range. Adjacent to the football field is a series of tennis courts as well as two intramural fields (used by the <a>Indianapolis Colts</a> during their summer training camp) near these courts. Rose-Hulman's sports facilities also include the <a>Art Nehf</a> <a>baseball</a> field, a <a>softball</a> field, and the Jim Rendel <a>soccer</a> field.</p>

<p>Rose-Hulman currently competes in the <a>Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> (HCAC), an <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> <a>athletic conference</a>. It was previously a member of the <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> (SCAC) and <a>Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> (ICAC), the latter now known as the <a>HCAC</a>. Despite no longer sharing a conference affiliation with the <a>SCAC</a>, Rose-Hulman has always had a rivalry with <a>DePauw University</a>, and has consistently had nonleague rivalries with other nearby strong academic schools such as <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>, <a>University of Chicago</a>, and <a>Denison University</a>.</p>
<p>The men and women's Swimming and Diving team will participate in the <a>College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin</a>. The colors of the Rose-Hulman Fightin' Engineers are rose and white, and their mascot is Rosie the Elephant.</p>
<p>As of 2005, Rose-Hulman has had a student athlete named to an NCAA Division III <a>Academic All-America</a> Team for 21 consecutive years. Sixty-four Academic All-Americans have been named from the school since 1978.</p>
<p>For the 2007-2008 school year, Rose-Hulman won the Commissioner's Cup from the HCAC. This award is given to the school with the most number of points based on the teams performance in the conference.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>The Rose-Hulman football program was started in the year of 1882. That year, Rose (then known simply as Rose Polytechnic Institute) played one game against Wabash College which they lost 12-0. In the early years, Rose played the likes of the University of Notre Dame, Purdue University, University of Illinois, Indiana University, and Indiana Normal School, which is now Indiana State University. Led by head coach Steve Englehart and senior Quarterback Derrek Eitel, Rose-Hulman finished the 2009 season with a 6-4 record.</p>
<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p>Baseball first made an appearance at Rose-Hulman in 1888. Since then, the baseball team has been a mainstay on the Rose-Hulman campus except for the stretch of time between 1929 and 1947 when Rose-Hulman could not field a team. In 2008, the team received a bid to the NCAA Division III Mideastern Regional Tournament which was held at Art Nehf Field on the campus of Rose-Hulman. The regional tournament has also been held on Rose-Hulman's campus in 2005 and 2006. The team also won the HCAC Conference Tournament, receiving and <a>automatic bid</a> to the NCAA Division III Mideastern Regional Tournament. In 2008 and 2009, the Engineers won their first game before losing the following two to be eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<h3>Soccer</h3>
<p>The Women's soccer team was the 2007 HCAC Champions and made an appearance in the NCAA Division III Tournament in the same season. They repeated at the regular season conference champions in 2009. They also have record of 98-45-6 since. The Men's soccer team was the best team in the HCAC regular season in 2008 and 2009 and 2nd in 2006 and 2007, making the program's first ever appearance in the NCAA Division III National Soccer Tournament in 2008. They also have a record of 53-21-7 between 2006 and 2009.</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>The Rose&#x2013;Hulman Institute of Technology swimming and diving program has earned regional respect and achieved national accomplishments during the past decade. Rose-Hulman&#x2019;s swimming and diving resume features one national champion, six All-American awards and 64 all-conference awards since 1998. The men&#x2019;s squad finished either third or fourth in the nationally competitive <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> for eight consecutive years, while the women improved from seventh to fourth in the 2005 campaign. The accomplishments include 17 provisional national qualification times, 11 conference champions and four individual swimmers competing at the NCAA Division III National Championships.</p>
<p>Rose-Hulman&#x2019;s ascent to national prominence began in 1999, when Sean Valentine captured the first two All-American awards in school history. Valentine placed fourth in the  freestyle and sixth in the  breaststroke at the NCAA Division III Nationals. Matt Smith became Rose-Hulman&#x2019;s first swimming national champion in 2003. Smith&#x2019;s career included four All-American honors, highlighted by a first place in the  breaststroke in 2003. He captured eight individual league championships, including three  breaststroke titles. David Breiding, a 2004 graduate, also qualified for the NCAA Division III National Championships during a career that featured nine individual all-conference awards. Adam Effinger continued the tradition with a pair of honorable mention All-American efforts at the 2006 NCAA Division III National Championships.</p>
<p>The women&#x2019;s swimming and diving team earned its first significant regional and national accolades in 2005. The  medley relay team of Jessica Frank, Anita Isch, Elaine Kratz and Erin O&#x2019;Connor earned the first national provisional qualification in the history of the women&#x2019;s program and captured all-conference honors. The all-conference accolades continued with two individual and one relay award in 2006.</p>

<h3>Rose-Hulman Ventures</h3>
<p>Rose-Hulman Ventures is an engineering educational experience located at Rose-Hulman's South Campus, three miles (5&nbsp;km) south of the main campus. It serves as a source of internships and job opportunities with startups and established companies of all sizes for Rose students and alumni. From 1999-2009, 749 students have worked as interns for 117 companies. Rose-Hulman Ventures was established in 1999 with a $30 million grant from the Lilly Endowment and received a $24.9 million follow-up grant in 2002. <a>Rose-Hulman Ventures Website</a></p>
<h2>Student engineering projects</h2>
<p>There are many activities and clubs at Rose-Hulman, but there are several engineering projects that frequently take the spotlight. The institute has recently started an Advanced Transportation Initiative that has attracted national attention. With its close proximity to the most prominent automotive and transportation companies in the United States, Rose-Hulman is able to partner with companies to integrate current technology and industry developments into the curriculum beyond senior projects so that students can have a four-year experience understanding the engineering world.</p>
<h3>Challenge X and EcoCAR</h3>
<p>The team at Rose-Hulman was initially created to compete in the Challenge X competition. ChallengeX was a competition among 17 Universities in the United States and Canada that partner with General Motors and the Department of Energy to re-engineer a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox to improve fuel efficiency and decrease emissions. The team ranges from 30-70 students and has been an integral part of the Universities Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering programs. The vehicle uses a power-split hybrid architecture as the team modified their vehicle into a rear wheel drive diesel-electric hybrid using B20 biodiesel fuel. The university allows them to use a designated section of the Rotz Lab on campus as team headquarters. Students receive course credit for this project. <a>Rose-Hulman ChallengeX Team Website</a></p>
<p>The start of the 2008-2009 school year brought with it a new challenge, EcoCAR. The EcoCAR challenge is a three-year competition that is the latest in the 19-year history of the Department of Energy advanced vehicle competitions. Rose-Hulman competes with 16 other schools throughout the United States and Canada to reengineer a Saturn Vue crossover. <a>Rose-Hulman EcoCAR Team Website</a></p>
<h3>Efficient Vehicle Team</h3>
<p>The team includes 18 students majoring in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and civil engineering &#x2013; - four students remaining from the original team that formed the RHEV group in 2003. The goal of this team is to develop a vehicle with very high gas mileage. The team competes in several national and international competitions each year. The driver lays flat on her back and steers the car by adjusting independent front wheel mechanisms. The vehicle is driven by a single rear wheel that&#x2019;s attached to the motor, located behind the driver&#x2019;s compartment.</p>
<h3>Human-Powered Vehicle Team</h3>
<p>The <a>Rose-Hulman Human Powered Vehicle Team</a> constructs a man-powered land vehicle to compete in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' <a>Human Powered Vehicle Challenge</a>. The vehicle must be light, highly efficient and powered only by its single occupant. The team at Rose-Hulman is a volunteer club.</p>
<p>The team has competed for five years. The first year, the &quot;Hautian Hazard&quot; gave a strong showing at the sprint and endurance events. However, due to a low design report score, the team only received 7th place at the ASME East Coast competition.</p>
<p>The second year, the &quot;R5&quot; came on strong and took second place overall at the ASME East Coast competition. It was clocked at over  in the sprint event. It also had a sustained one-hour endurance speed of  at an <a>HPRA</a> event.</p>
<p>The 2008 bike, &quot;Infinity&quot;, has performed extremely well at the both the East and West Coast ASME competitions. The team achieved first place overall at West Coast by earning a first-place finish in the women's sprint and design report, second place in the men's sprint, and third place in the endurance event. In the men's sprint the vehicle traveled at  through a 100-meter time trap. The team also achieved first place overall at the East Coast Competition by earning a first-place finish in the men's sprint, second place in the women's sprint and endurance event, and third place in the design report. Rose-Hulman was the second team ever to win both the East and West Coast ASME competitions in the same year.</p>
<p>The team continued to win in 2009 and 2010, winning the both the ASME East and ASME West Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge in each year. The vehicles built were dubbed &quot;Mark IV&quot; and &quot;Ragnar&#x00f6;k&quot;, respectively. In 2010, the team competed in a new vehicle class, Unrestricted, which required more practicality from the competing vehicles.  </p>
<p>In 2011, Rose-Hulman will be hosting the ASME HPVC East cost competition.</p>
