<p></p>
<p><strong>Ball State University</strong> is a <a>state-run</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Muncie</a>, <a>Indiana</a>. It is also known as <strong>Ball State</strong>, <strong>Ball U</strong>, or simply <strong>BSU</strong>.</p>
<p>Located on the northwest side of the city, Ball State's campus spans more than 1,000&nbsp;acres (4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;). The student body consists of more than 20,000 students, of which over 18,000 are undergraduate students and over 1,500 are graduate students.</p>
<p>Originally a <a>normal school</a>, Ball State has grown and expanded over the years.  Ball State is classified by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> as a Doctoral/Research University (DRU).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Ball State University was not the first school to operate at its location. Previous educational institutions operated at the intersection of University and McKinley Avenues before 1918; however, they were neither public nor did they carry the <a>&quot;Ball&quot;</a> name.</p>
<h3>The pre-Ball years</h3>
<p>The area of Muncie, Indiana that is now known as Ball State University had its start in 1899 as a private school called the Eastern Indiana Normal School to educate teachers. The entire school, including classrooms, library, and the president's residence were housed in what is now known as the Ball State Administration building.</p>
<p>The one-building school had a peak enrollment of 256 and charged $10 for a year's tuition. It operated until the spring of 1901, when it was closed by its president, F.A.Z. Kumler, due to the lack of funding. A year later, in the autumn of 1902, the school reopened as Palmer University for the next three years when Francis Palmer, a retired Indiana banker, gave the school a $100,000 <a>endowment</a>.</p>
<p>Between 1905 and 1907, the school dropped the Palmer name and operated as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating teachers and the College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of approximately 200 students. Due to a diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, school president Francis Ingler closed Indiana Normal College at the end of the 1906&#x2013;07 school year.</p>
<p>Between 1907 and 1912 the campus sat vacant. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated <a>foreclosure</a> proceedings.</p>
<h3>Ball Brothers intervene===&lt;!-- This section is linked from <a>Burris Laboratory School</a> --&gt;</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|400px|The Ball Brothers from left to right: George A. Ball, Lucius L. Ball, Frank C. Ball, Edmund B. Ball, and William C. Ball</a> On July 25, 1917, the <a>Ball Brothers</a>, local industrialists and founders of the <a>Ball Corp.</a>, bought the Indiana Normal Institute from foreclosure. For $35,100, the Balls bought the Administration Building and surrounding land bordered by University, McKinley, Riverside, and Tillotson Avenues, except the northwest quadrant which was maintained as a wildlife preserve (Christy Woods).</p>
<p>In early 1918, during the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a>'s short session, state legislators accepted the gift of the school and the land by the Ball Brothers. The state granted operating control of the Muncie Campus and school buildings to the administrators of the <a>Indiana State Normal School</a> in <a>Terre Haute</a>. That same year, the <a>Marion</a> Normal Institute relocated to Muncie, adding its resources to what would officially be named the Indiana State Normal School, Eastern Division. Incidentally, the former Marion Normal Institute's campus was purchased in 1919 by what would become <a>Indiana Wesleyan University</a>, currently the largest private university in Indiana.</p>
<p>The close relationship between the Balls and the school led to an unofficial moniker for the college as many students, faculty and local politicians casually referred to the school as &quot;Ball State&quot; as a shorthand alternative to its longer, official name. During the 1922 short session of the Indiana legislature, the state renamed the school as Ball Teachers College. This was in recognition to the Ball family's continuing beneficence to the institution. During this act, the state also reorganized its relationship with Terre Haute and established a separate local board of trustees for the Muncie campus.</p>
<p>In 1924, Ball Teachers College's trustees hired <a>Benjamin J. Burris</a> as the first president of the state-funded college. The Ball brothers continued giving to the university and partially funded the construction of the Science Hall (now called Burkhardt Building) in 1924 and an addition to Ball Gymnasium in 1925. By the 1925&#x2013;26 school year, Ball State enrollment reached 991 students: 697 women and 294 men. Based on the school's close relationship with the Ball Corporation, a long-running nickname for the school was &quot;Fruit Jar Tech.&quot;</p>
<h3>Ball State Teachers College</h3>
<p>[[Image:Beneficience.jpg|250px|lright|thumb|[[Beneficence (statue)|Beneficence]], Ball State's motto and memorial featured on school insignia]] During the regular legislative session of 1929, the Indiana General Assembly formally separated the Terre Haute and Muncie campuses of the state teachers college system, but it placed the governing of the Ball State campus under the Indiana State Teachers College Board of Trustees based in Terre Haute. With this action, the school was renamed Ball State Teachers College. The following year, enrollment increased to 1,118, with 747 female and 371 male students.</p>
<p>In 1935, the school added the Arts Building for art, music, and dance instruction (now used by the <a>Ball State University Museum of Art</a> and the Geological Science and Social Work departments). Enrollment that year reached 1,151: 723 women and 428 men.</p>
<p>As an expression of the many gifts from the Ball family since 1917, sculptor <a>Daniel Chester French</a> was commissioned by the Muncie <a>chamber of commerce</a> to cast a bronze fountain figure to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Ball brothers' gift to the state. His creation, the statue &quot;<a>Beneficence</a>,&quot; still stands today between the Administration Building and Lucina Hall where Talley Avenue ends at University Avenue.</p>
<p>In 1961, Ball State became fully independent of Indiana State University via the creation of the Ball State College Board of Trustees, so that Ball State was no longer governed remotely by the Indiana State College Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>At the Spring 2009 Commencement, President <a>Jo Ann M. Gora</a>, alongside Indiana Senator <a>Richard Lugar</a>, announced Ball State's plan for the nation's largest <a>geothermal energy</a> project. Over the next decade, a series of 4,000 boreholes (each 400 feet deep) will be placed at various locations around the campus to allow the campus's 40 buildings to be heated and cooled via the use of heated and cooled waters. The first well field, containing nearly 1800 boreholes, began in July 2009. The first distribution loop is planned to begin the summer of 2010. The project will cost approximately $93 million. This geothermal project is estimated to eliminate 80,000 tons of carbon emissions annually, cut energy costs by an estimated $2 million annually, reduce approximately half of the current campus carbon footprint, and eliminate four coal-fired boilers built in the 1950s.</p>
<h3>Shafer Tower</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Shafer Tower</a> Dedicated in 2002, <a>Shafer Tower</a> has become an unofficial landmark of Ball State University. It is a free-standing <a>bell tower</a>, or <a>campanile</a>, that is equipped with a <a>carillon</a>. It is located in the <a>median</a> of McKinley Avenue, in the heart of University Green.</p>
<p>A small staircase in the tower leads to a control room of the carillon, which has 48 custom-made bells. From here, a musician can play the instrument on special occasions or for concerts. Normally, on days which classes are held, the bells are programmed by computer to chime automatically every 15 minutes between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Due to a construction defect in the type of mortar used to hold the bricks, about two-thirds of the brick on the tower had to be removed and reinstalled. The tower was, in effect, built twice. The architect of record was Edmund Hafer Associates of <a>Evansville, Indiana</a>.</p>
<h3>Emens Auditorium</h3>
<p>A cultural center for the University and the Muncie community, Emens Auditorium hosts many events annually, ranging from music concerts to Broadway musicals to guest lecturers. Built in 1964 with a capacity of 3,575, the auditorium is named for former Ball State President John R. Emens.</p>
<h3>Bracken Library</h3>
<p>Possibly the top destination for Ball State students is Bracken Library. This facility has the floor area of nearly seven <a>American football</a> fields and houses five floors of university offices, classrooms, computer labs, private study suites, video viewing suites, and thousands of books, videos, and audio devices available to students. <a>Bracken Library</a> hosts the Ball State University <a>Digital Media Repository</a>, an open access resource containing over 130,000 digital objects in 64 collections. Gatecount entries total more than 4,200 students visiting Bracken Library daily. Built in 1975, Bracken's most recent remodel finished in 1997.</p>
<p>The Bookmark Cafe, opened in January 2007, is a popular cafe and lounge area on the first floor.</p>
<h3>L. A. Pittenger Student Center</h3>
<p>Completed in 1952, the Student Center houses the University's hotel, meeting rooms, a food court, and various forms of recreation for students, including a bowling alley. It is also home to other services, such as student programming and the University-owned campus barbershop.</p>
<p>In September 2006, the University rejected a proposal to build a new student center. In lieu of a new building, the University approved a remodel and expansion, which was completely recently.</p>
<h3>Ball Honors House</h3>
<p>The Edmund F. and Virginia B. Ball Honors House is the new home of Ball State University&#x2019;s Honor College. The white Colonial-style house, which was originally built in the 1930s, has undergone $1.3 million in renovations. The home is only a short distance from the DeHority Complex, which houses many Honors College students. The home has three classrooms (two of them fully technology-equipped), administrative offices for staff, a full kitchen, and private gathering areas for students. The Honors College was previous located in the basement of Carmichael Hall.</p>
<h3>Student Housing</h3>
<p>The University currently operates ten residence complexes that house nearly 7,000 students. Ball State's freshman residence hall program is listed as one of the best in the nation by the &quot;Unofficial, Unbiased Insider's Guide to the Most Interesting Colleges.&quot;</p>
<p>By far the largest housing complex is <a>LaFollette Complex</a>, which houses over 1,900 students. This co-ed facility, completed in 1967, has four L-shaped, eight-story units, and a ten story tower in the center that houses mainly non-traditinoal and international students. Johnson Complex, on the north end of campus, is a modern complex consisting of one eight-story building and two four-story buildings. The complex is the only one on campus to feature Z-shaped rooms.</p>
<p>In addition, Ball State has one all-female residence hall that houses approximately 600 students. The Woodworth Complex comprises four halls and also houses sorority suites. In the fall of 2007, a two-story dining facility and atrium attached to the complex re-opened after two years of renovations.</p>
<p>Of the current residence halls in operation, only one, Elliott Hall, has been in operation for most of the University's history. Constructed from 1937 to 1939, Elliott was formerly an all-male dormitory and, during <a>World War II</a>, housed cadets and recruits from joint programs operated by the Army and Air Force.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Woodworth Complex</li>
  <li>Wagoner Complex (Houses <a>Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities</a> Students)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the residence halls, two apartment complexes operated by the University provide affordable homes for single students and students with families. Apartments are available in one- and two-bedroom styles, and townhouses are available in two- and three-bedroom styles. The apartments are located close to campus, shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and schools.</p>
<p>Three of Ball State's taller residence halls &#x2013; Lafollette, Johnson, and Studebaker East &#x2013; have unusual elevator systems because the halls were early co-ed dorms. As such, their elevators serve only two floors: the first floor lobby and the sixth floor lobby, which duplicates the first floor almost exactly. This served to separate the male and female portions of the dormitory, as the stairs pass through lobby doors.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Ball State campus since 1919, but this date was chosen due to an inaccuracy in records. It could be said that Greek-letter organizations at Ball State date back to 1905 with the founding of Indiana Normal School and College of Applied Science, Ball State's predecessor. Historical records are not specific regarding the number of Greek-letter organizations founded during this time. However, records show that, in 1907 the president, Francis M. Ingler decreed all fraternities to be disbanded. This was decided after a cow was discovered roaming through the Phi Sigma Theta fraternity house. Indiana Normal School and College of Applied Science also closed in 1907.</p>
<p>The Eastern Branch of the Indiana State Normal School, which later became Ball State University, opened in 1918. The Girls Club started within a year of the school's founding. This followed in the tradition of the organization at Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. All girls were eligible to become club members. Local sororities started in sections of the club beginning with Alpha sorority in 1920, which later became Alpha Chi Omega. With the inaccuracy of records before the Girls club's founding, Ball State University celebrates 1919 as the founding year for the Greek community at Ball State.</p>
<p>The Navajo social club, the first men's organization at Ball State, also was founded in 1920. The club later became Lambda Chi Alpha. Ball State did not have a large collection of national organizations until the mid-1950s, as many local organizations began affiliating with national fraternities and sororities.</p>
<h4>Chapters</h4>
<p>Ball State is home to 27 Greek organizations on campus, including 15 fraternities and 12 sororities. Around eight percent of all undergraduates are members of the Greek community, with over 1,200 students maintaining membership in a Greek organization.</p>
<h5>Fraternities</h5>

<h3>University Village</h3>
<p>The commercial district immediately adjacent to campus, known as University Village, plays an integral part of campus life for students who live on- and off-campus. Known informally as &quot;The Village,&quot; the district is home to a set of shops and restaurants located immediately east of the southern part of campus. Although most of the buildings have been rebuilt over the years, The Village has existed in its present location since the early 1920s. Current businesses include Be Here Now, Village Green Records, MT Cup, White Rabbit, Art Mart, Locker Room, Wizard's Keep, Scotty's Brewhouse, and 420 Underground. Dining options include <a>Subway</a>, <a>Pita Pit</a>, <a>Jimmy John's</a> Gourmet Subs, Greek's Pizzeria, The Chug, and Dill Street Bar &amp; Grill. During the heated 2008 Presidential primary season, <a>President</a> <a>Barack Obama</a> opened a campaign office in the heart of University Village.</p>
<p>Most evenings, Mark Carter, more commonly known as &quot;the hot dog man,&quot; sells his &quot;nearly world famous&quot; hot dogs to patrons of the numerous bars in the village area adjacent to the BSU campus. Carter was named number fifty-one on Sports Illustrated's &quot;The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate&quot; list, published in 2003. Humorously enough, Carter's first name is erroneously listed as James in the accompanying article. For a time, Carter operated a storefront location on Martin Street in The Village but returned to his original method of selling from a cart at the intersection of Dill Street and University Avenue several years ago. Carter's most popular item is the <a>chili cheese dog</a>, although he also offers <a>bratwurst</a>, <a>Italian</a>, and polish sausages.</p>
<h3>Other campus features</h3>
<p>The Cow Path, a north-south pedestrian pathway, extends along part of the western border of the campus from the Johnson residence halls to Riverside Avenue, passing to the west of the McKinley Avenue buildings. At one time, it also linked the intersection of Neely and McKinley Avenues, cutting a trail across a grassy field on which the Bell Building now stands.</p>
<p>The newest academic building on campus is the <a>David Letterman</a> Communication and Media Building, named for Ball State's arguably most famous alumnus. It was dedicated during a ceremony on September 7, 2007, with Letterman as the guest of honor.</p>
<p>The tallest structure on campus is Shafer Tower. The tallest habitable building is Teachers College, which, at 138&nbsp;feet (42&nbsp;m), is also the tallest building in Muncie.</p>
<p>Two streets located in close proximity to campus, named Ball and Dicks, have their street signs stolen at least once each academic year. Just off campus, the High Street sign often is missing as well.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Ball State has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent from 2007 levels by 2014 through the installation of a geothermal heating and cooling system and the cessation of burning coal on campus.  In 2011, the <em>Sustainable Endowments Institute</em> gave Ball State a  College Sustainability Report Card grade of &quot;C+.&quot;</p>
<h2>Satellite Campuses</h2>
<p>Emphasizing immersive learning experiences, Ball State operates a satellite campus in Indianapolis and Muncie, as well as a number of specialized centers abroad. The Rinker Center for International Programs is responsible for maintaining these satellite campuses.</p>
<h3>Australia Center</h3>
<p>Second only to the London Center in popularity, one of the most popular study abroad programs is the Australia Center. Students are housed in youth camp facilities in the coastal city of Lennox, Head, Australia. Day trips to rainforests and marine reserves allow learning experiences outside the classroom, and students are also free to travel the continent on weekends and during breaks.</p>
<h3>Costa Rica Center</h3>
<p>In partnership with the Monteverde Rainforest Institute, the Costa Rica Center offers students a chance to combine academics with Central American customs, traditions, and values while serving the surrounding communities.  Trips to the Center are offered as semester-long or 6-week terms. The former offers Spanish language classes, anthropology, history, sociology, and environmental studies, whereas the later provides credit for anthropology or in other participating departments.</p>
<h3>Indianapolis Center</h3>
<p>The Indianapoils Center is high-tech, interactive education, research, information, and outreach center located in downtown Indianapolis at 50 South <a>Meridian Street</a>.</p>
<h3>London Centre</h3>
<p>The oldest Ball State's international program (established in 1972), the London Center hosts 25-35 full-time students, living in the heart of London and studying under British and American professors. Residency and course loads are pre-arranged through the University and the <a>City of Westminster College</a> staff to provide an enjoyable, informative, and accredited catalog from which students may choose. In addition to academic and residency provisions, enrollment in the London Center includes admission to 8-10 major theatre productions and guided tours of London.  Weekly day trips also are arranged to English cities and locales at the discresion of the Director appointed each semester. Destinations include Liverpool, Brighton &amp; Hove, Canterbury Cathedral, and Stonehenge.</p>
<h3>Prague Center</h3>
<p>The Ball State University Prague Center is located in Prague, the breathtaking capital of the Czech Republic. The region has overcome communism and blossomed into a high-tech business gateway to Central Europe, as well as a capital of higher education, where students will be sent biannually as part of the Ball State&#x2019;s newest study abroad program.  Miller College of Business, along with the Rinker Center for International Programs, will host the Prague Center. The inaugural session at the Prague Center will run during the 2010 fall semester and will include weekly cultural excursions. Directed by a Miller College of Business faculty member, the center will offer classes in business as well as electives that meet Ball State&#x2019;s core curriculum. These courses will be taught by Ball State faculty and local experts. Long weekends allow students the time to travel to other European countries such as Germany, Poland, Austria, and Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Worcester Center</h3>
<p>Created in partnership with the <a>University of Worcester</a>, the Worcester Center offers students an opportunity to experience the best of British life and culture while earning academic credit in liberal arts subjects.  Just a few miles away from <a>Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, <a>Shakespeare</a>&#x2019;s birthplace, as well as a number of bustling cities such as <a>Birmingham</a>, there is no shortage of activities near <a>Worcester</a>.</p>
