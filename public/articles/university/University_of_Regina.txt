<p>  The <strong>University of Regina</strong> is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Regina, Saskatchewan</a>, <a>Canada</a>. Founded in 1911 as a private denominational high school of the <a>Methodist Church of Canada</a>, it began an association with the <a>University of Saskatchewan</a> as a junior college in 1925, and was disaffiliated by the Church and fully ceded to the University in 1934; in 1961 it attained degree-granting status as the Regina Campus of the <a>University of Saskatchewan</a>. It became an autonomous university in 1974. The enabling legislation is <em>An Act Respecting the University of Regina, Chapter U-5.</em>  It had an enrolment of over 12,500 full and part-time students as of the 2002-03 academic year and was rated sixth in the 2005 <em><a>Maclean's</a></em> magazine Canadian National Comprehensive Universities Rankings. The university's student newspaper, The Carillon, is a member of <a>CUP</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|225px|Regina College under construction on 16th Avenue (now College Avenue), 1913</a></p>
<p>The University of Regina is a non-denominational university, which grew out of Regina College, founded in 1911. In direct response to the award of the University of Saskatchewan to Saskatoon rather than Regina, the <a>Methodist Church of Canada</a> established Regina College in 1911 on College Avenue in Regina, Saskatchewan, starting with an enrollment of 27 students; it was adjacent to the now long-defunct St Chad's College (a theological seminary for the training of Anglican clergy) and Qu'Appelle Diocesan School, also on College Avenue. </p>
<p>In 1934 Regina College became part of the University of Saskatchewan. The <a>University of Saskatchewan</a> a single, public provincial university created in 1907 was modeled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modeled on the <em>University of Toronto Act</em>, 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership. In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. though continuing as a denominational college of the now-<a>United Church of Canada</a>, the successor to the Methodist Church. Regina College continued as a Junior College until 1959, when it received full degree granting status as a second campus of the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<h3>Junior College of University of Saskatchewan</h3>
<p><a>thumb||left|200px|Regina College Building.</a>With the transfer of control to the University of Saskatchewan the range of courses offered was somewhat broadened. During this period <a>Campion</a> and Luther Colleges, which maintained private high schools in Regina under the auspices respectively of the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches, also retained junior college status in affiliation with the University of Saskatchewan; the Anglican Church, whose St Chad's College had operated a theological training facility in Regina, meanwhile merged with Emmanuel College in Saskatoon and withdrew from tertiary education in Regina. </p>
<p>The upgrading process accelerated in 1961 when the college was granted full-degree granting status as the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan and students completing degrees at Regina Campus were granted degrees of the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|Dr. John Archer Library, Main Campus</a>Yamaski's vision of the new university campus as part of the wider <a>Wascana Centre</a> involved the eventual <a>Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts</a> as an adjacent convocation hall, which informed its placement on the south shore of Wascana Lake, some distance from the city centre, to the serious detriment of the city centre at a time when issues of inner-urban decay did not yet appear likely to affect Regina.  It was not immediately apparent that the development of the new campus would quickly stall: after an initial spate of development in the mid-60s and early 70s, building substantially lapsed for some years. The <a>Dr. John Archer Library</a>, the main library of the university, was opened in 1967, one of the original three buildings of the new campus (the others being the classroom and laboratory buildings), and named after <a>Dr. John Archer</a> in 1999. Further building has been substantially in accord with Yamasaki's vision, notwithstanding some controversy over the years as to the suitability of its austere style for the featureless Regina plain; by 1972 with the demolition of Yamasaki's 1955 <a>Pruitt&#x2013;Igoe</a> housing project in St. Louis, Missouri &#x2014; such demolition being considered by some to be the beginning of postmodern architecture &#x2014; Yamasaki's modernist aesthetic was already somewhat pass&#x00e9; in the view of many architects.</p>
<p><a>Campion College</a> and later Luther College, which like Regina College had also been denominational junior colleges affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan, established &quot;federated college&quot; status on the model of <a>Victoria</a>, <a>Trinity</a>, <a>St Michael's</a> and <a>University</a> Colleges at the <a>University of Toronto</a> (and ultimately the collegiate system of <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>) and built facilities at the new campus. (St Chad's, a fourth denominational college in Regina, operated by the <a>Anglican Church of Canada</a> on the former Anglican diocesan property on College Avenue immediately to the east of Regina College, merged with Emmanuel College on the Saskatoon campus in 1964 and, after a period of continuing to operate its private girls' high school closed its Regina facilities in 1970.) </p>
<p>As with other rapidly expanding universities in the late 1960s, the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan was able to benefit from a significant outflow of academics from American universities during the <a>Vietnam War</a> era of U.S. history at a time when the supply of Canadian PhDs could not yet keep up with demand ; it was labelled by a deputy commissioner of the <a>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP, the Canadian federal police force) as one of the three most radical campuses in Canada , along with Burnaby's <a>Simon Fraser University</a> and Sir George Williams University (now part of <a>Concordia University</a>) in Montreal.</p>
<h3>University of Regina</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|387px|The Terrace, Regina Research Park. South Residence and La Residence visible above.</a>Disappointment as to the non-fulfilment of plans by the University of Saskatchewan to situate various faculties at the Regina rather than the Saskatoon campus and a range of other issues of discontent led to the formation of a Faculty Council with the goal of making the campus an autonomous institution ; a Royal Commission under the chairmanship of former Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and Supreme Court of Canada Justice <a>Emmett Hall</a> found there to be &quot;two campus groups warring within the bosom of a single university.&quot; As a result the University of Regina was established as an independent institution on 1 July 1974 and the Normal School was substantially renovated to become the <a>Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage</a>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2005 the University of Regina hosted the <a>2005 Canada Games</a>. Many events took place in the newly completed state-of-the-art Centre for Kinesiology, Health and Sport. The administration of the games proceeded from the University of Regina Students Union offices and various other locations across campus.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|275px|Laboratory (extension under construction, 2007), Classroom and Library buildings, viewed across the new Oval from South Residence</a>The campus has experienced a recent spurt of growth and expansion, having been static for some two decades after the construction of La Residence at the end of the 1970s. The Education Building has been significantly enlarged and the new Riddell Centre, the North and South Residences, the Centre of Kinesiology and the <a>First Nations University of Canada</a> have been built. The building of the North and South Residences also involved a significant redevelopment of the landscaping of the campus around a new oval as an aesthetic and community hub of campus. A lab building extension is under construction which will add  to the university. Future plans include construction on the east side of the Ring Road. The goal is to accommodate an enrolment of 25,000.  </p>
<p>In early 2006 the construction of a multipurpose arena on the University of Regina campus was under discussion. The <a>Regina Research Park</a> is located immediately adjacent to the main campus and conducts many of its initiatives in conjunction with university departments. In recent years, local benefactors have substantially endowed the university with scholarships and chairs in various disciplines.</p>
<h2>Federated colleges</h2>
<p>The University has three federated colleges:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Campion College</a></li>
  <li><a>First Nations University of Canada</a></li>
  <li><a>Luther College</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a>left|thumb|275px|First Nations University of Canada</a>Campion and Luther colleges had been high schools offering junior college courses accredited by the University of Saskatchewan on the same basis as the old Regina College, out of premises located elsewhere in Regina. <a>Campion College</a> became a junior college of the University of Saskatchewan like Regina College in 1923, later severed that association in favour of one with St Boniface College in Manitoba, and returned to federated college status with the University of Saskatchewan in 1964. It built its facilities on the new Regina Campus in 1968 and subsequently vacated its original high school premises on 23rd Avenue. Its Regina Campus building was designed in accordance with <a>Minoru Yamasaki</a>'s original plan for the campus, with a &quot;podium,&quot; contemplated as eventually being joined with the campus-wide ground floor. Thus far this has not occurred and Campion's building remains isolated.</p>
<p>Luther College opened its building on the new Regina Campus in 1971 but continues to operate its high school on Royal Street, on the site of the first <a>Government House of the North-West Territories</a>. By this point the original Yamasaki plan for the campus was being reconsidered and the Luther College complex is isolated to the east of the principal campus buildings, though it is connected by an all-weather corridor via Campion College.</p>
<p>The <a>First Nations University of Canada</a> grew out of the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College, established in 1976, which was an original foundation at the University of Regina. Its new building to the east of Luther College replaced its original facilities to the west of College West and was opened by <a>Prince Edward</a> in 2003 and visited by the Queen in 2005 when she installed a commemorative stone to symbolise the special relationship between Canada's First Nations and the sovereign.</p>
<p>The United Church, having vacated tertiary education in Regina when it ceded Regina College to the University of Saskatchewan, and the Anglican Church, having removed its St Chad's College from Regina to Saskatoon, do not maintain any presence at the University of Regina. The Christian and Missionary Alliance Church formerly maintained the residential Canadian Bible College in Regina and offered some of its courses for accreditation with the University of Regina but was unable to obtain university status in Saskatchewan and vacated to Calgary in 2003.</p>
<h2>Faculties</h2>
<p>The University of Regina has ten faculties and one school that offer a variety of programs at the certificate, diploma, undergraduate and graduate degree levels. </p>
<p>The University of Regina also has one school, the <a>Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy</a>. It delivers Masters and Doctoral programs in conjunction with the <a>University of Saskatchewan</a>. </p>
<p>The University of Regina also offers a number of pre-professional transfer programs with other universities and professional colleges: Agriculture and Bioresources, Chiropractic, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<h3>Co-operative Education</h3>
<p>The University of Regina is the one of the universities with <a>co-operative education</a> in Saskatchewan.  Many of the university undergraduate students are enrolled in the co-op program with the highest percentage being in the faculties of science and engineering. The Faculty of Arts offers an innovative internship program for its undergraduate students.</p>
<h2>Residences</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|237px|College West viewed from the new South Residence across the re-landscaped Oval.</a>Regina College originally contained male and female student residences which were converted to academic use when the College became affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan in 1934. (The old girls' residence now accommodates the Regina Conservatory of Music.) </p>

<h2>Sports</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|150px|Regina Rams football uniform: 2009</a> <a>thumb|300px|U of R Athletic Wall of Excellence</a> The University of Regina is a member of <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> and fields men and women's teams in various sports. Its teams bear the name &quot;<a>Cougars</a>&quot; in all sports, except the Regina Rams, which were originally a community junior football team competing in PJFC football without affiliation with the University, and who joined University ranks in 1999 as a member of the Canada West Conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The University sports teams are: the Regina Rams (football); men's basketball; women's basketball; men's volleyball; women's volleyball; men's hockey; women's hockey; women's soccer; track and field; swimming; cross country; wrestling; and cheerleading. In the summer of 2005, the University hosted the Canada Summer Games.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>The university's <a>student newspaper</a> is <em><a>The Carillon</a></em>. It for many years was an organ of radical student dissent and in the 60s and 70s frequently had a very high community profile as its editorial postures occasioned vigorous denunciation by university administration figures and in the conservative general press. As student mores in subsequent generations have become less disputatious the <em>Carillon</em> has evolved into a less political paper which currently is a somewhat conventional newsletter of campus affairs.</p>
<p>The university is home to the School of Journalism, which was one of the first established in western Canada. The School publishes a student periodical, <em>The Crow</em>, and hosts the annual Minifie lecture, in honour of one of Canada's most illustrious journalists, James M. Minifie (1900&#x2013;1974).</p>
<p>The University of Regina does not have its own <a>campus radio</a> station, although the independent <a>community radio</a> station <a>CJTR-FM</a> actively solicits volunteers among the school's student body.</p>
<p>The school launched <a>Your Official University of Regina blog (YOURblog)</a> in October 2010, a place where the U of R community and the public can read, discuss and share ideas and experiences with each other and the connection between campus and the world. YOURblog strives to be interesting, informative and above all collaborative. In that spirit, the site and its content are shaped by site visitors&#x2019; <a>input and participation</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Regina is home to the Interactive Media and Performance Labs (<a>IMP Labs</a>), which includes programming for the student body as well as members of the community. The Labs have been particularly recognized through the IMP Labs Hip Hop Project with <a>Scott Collegiate</a>. The directors of this program, Dr. Charity Marsh and Chris Beingessner, received the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards for Arts and Learning through the <a>Saskatchewan Arts Board</a>.</p>
<h2>Aboriginal</h2>
<p>The University of Regina provides services to Aboriginal people in more remote communities. The University of Regina&#x2019;s SUNTEP program was developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet specific needs within Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal Elders are present on campus at University of Regina to provide social supports. Through the University of Regina&#x2019;s K&#x00e2;spohtamat&#x00e2;t&#x00e2;n Mentorship Program Aboriginal students act as role models to younger students still in their home communities. The University of Regina has established an Aboriginal Career Centre to assist with the transition to a fulfilling career.</p>
