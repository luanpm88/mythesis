<p><strong>The University of Iowa</strong> (also known as <strong>U of I</strong>, or simply <strong>Iowa</strong>) is a <a>public</a> flagship state-supported research university located in <a>Iowa City, Iowa</a>. The University of Iowa is the oldest public university in the state. The university is organized into eleven colleges granting undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees. UI is categorized as RU/VH Research University (very high research activity) in the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>. The university is a group member of the prestigious <a>Association of American Universities</a>, the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>, <a>Committee on Institutional Cooperation</a>, and the <a>Universities Research Association</a>. </p>
<p>The University is home to the <a>University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics</a>, nationally recognized as one of America's best hospitals. According to U.S. News and Reports, three specialty departments were recognized as being in the top ten across the country. They are Otolaryngology (4th), Ophthalmology and visual sciences (6th) and Orthopaedics and rehabilitation (9th). It is one of the largest university-owned teaching hospitals in the nation. Iowa was the first American institution of higher learning to accept creative work for academic credit, and developed the <a>Master of Fine Arts</a> degree.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|University seal mosaic, ca. 1908, Iowa Hall.</a> The University of Iowa was originally named The <strong>State University of Iowa</strong>, and this remains the institution's official legal name. The State University of Iowa was founded February 25, 1847 as Iowa's first public institution of higher learning, only 59 days after <a>Iowa</a> became a <a>state</a>.  </p>
<p>The first faculty offered instruction at the university in March 1855 to students in the Old Mechanics Building, situated where Seashore Hall is now. In September 1855, there were 124 students, of whom forty-one were women. The 1856&ndash;57 catalogue listed nine departments offering <a>Ancient Language</a>, Modern <a>Language</a>, Intellectual <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Moral Philosophy</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Natural History</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Natural Philosophy</a>, and <a>Chemistry</a>. The first President was <a>Leigh S. J. Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>The original campus was composed of the <a>Iowa Old Capitol Building</a> and the  (4.046 hectares) of land on which it stood. Following the placing of the cornerstone July 4, 1840, the building housed the Fifth Legislative Assembly of the <a>Territory of Iowa</a> (December 5, 1842) and then became the first capitol of the State of Iowa (December 28, 1846). Until that date it had been the third capitol of the Territory of Iowa. When the capitol of Iowa was moved to <a>Des Moines</a> in 1857, Old Capitol became the first permanent &quot;home&quot; of the University. <a>thumb|right|Old Capitol Building in February 2005</a></p>
<p>In 1855, Iowa became the first public university in the United States to <a>admit men and women on an equal basis</a>. Additionally, the university was the world's first university to accept creative work in theater, writing, music, and art on an equal basis with academic research. </p>
<p>The university was one of the first institutions in America to grant a law degree to a woman (<a>Mary B. Hickey Wilkinson</a>, 1873), to grant a law degree to an African American (<a>G. Alexander Clark</a>, 1879), and to put an African American on a varsity athletic squad (<a>Frank Holbrook</a>, 1895). The university offered its first <a>doctoral degree</a> in 1898. </p>
<p>The university was the first state-university to officially recognize the <a>Gay</a>, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Allied Union (1970). </p>
<p>Iowa established the first law school west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>, and was also the first to use <a>television</a> in education (1932) and pioneered the field of <a>standardized testing</a>. Additionally, Iowa was the first Big Ten institution to promote an African American to an administrative vice president&#x2019;s position (Dr. <a>Phillip Hubbard</a>, promoted in 1966). </p>
<h3>Recent headline events</h3>
<p>On November 1, 1991, five employees of the university were killed and one student was critically injured when <a>Gang Lu</a>, a former physics graduate student, went on a shooting rampage before committing suicide. Officials received letters written by Lu that discussed his grievances and plans; apparently Lu was set off because he felt that his dissertation should have been received more eagerly.    </p>
<p>On April 13, 2006, a <a>tornado</a> struck the university and adjacent <a>Iowa City</a>, causing extensive damage throughout the campus and town.  The tornado was the most intense and destructive of 5 tornadoes that touched down in <a>Johnson County, Iowa</a> that evening; it was given the rank of F2 on the <a>Fujita Scale</a>. &#x201c;Damage on the campus was limited to a parking garage for university vehicles and some downed trees.&#x201d;   Several Iowa City homes and businesses received extensive damage.  Despite the wreckage, injuries were relatively light in the area, although one person in a neighboring county was killed.</p>
<p>On June 8, 2008, the Army Corps of Engineers warned that flooding on the Iowa River and overflow from the Coralville Reservoir would cause major and potentially record flooding. Such an event could have serious implications and bring widespread damage to campus buildings. After flood waters breached the reservoir spillway more than 20 major campus buildings were damaged.  Several weeks after the flood waters receded university officials placed a preliminary estimate on flood damage at $231.75 million.  Later, the UI Vice President estimated that damages would cost about $743 million.  </p>
<p>In November 2008, responding to a proposal from the UI Writing University committee, <a>UNESCO</a> designated Iowa City the world's third <a>City of Literature</a>, making it part of the UNESCO <a>Creative Cities Network</a>.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:UIowaOldCapitol.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Capitol, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]] The University of Iowa's main campus is located in Iowa City, originally designed by architect D. Elwood Cook, with the campus bordered by Park Road to the north and Dubuque and Gilbert Streets roughly to the east. <a>U.S. Highway 6</a> traverses the university campus. The <a>Iowa River</a> flows through the campus dividing it into west and east sides.</p>
<p>Of architectural note is the <a>Pentacrest</a> at the center of The University of Iowa campus. The Pentacrest is the location of five major campus buildings: <a>Old Capitol</a>, Schaeffer Hall, MacLean Hall, Macbride Hall, and Jessup Hall. The Old Capitol was once the primary government building for the state of Iowa, but it is now a museum of Iowa history.</p>
<p>Also on the eastern side of campus includes five residence halls (Burge, Daum, Stanley, Currier, and Mayflower), the Iowa Memorial Union, the Pappajohn Business Building, the Seamans Center for the engineering arts and sciences, the Lindquist Center (home of the College of Education), Phillips Hall (home of foreign languages) and Van Allen Hall (home to physics and astronomy)as well as the buildings for biology, chemistry, geology &amp; environmental sciences, psychology, communications, journalism and the English-Philosophy Building. The Main Library can also be found on the East Side.</p>
<p>The Colleges of Law, Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and <a>Public Health</a> are on the western bank of the Iowa River, along with the <a>University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics</a>, the Theatre Building and <a>Voxman</a> Music Building. Additionally, five residence halls (Hillcrest, Slater, Reinow, Quadrangle, and Parklawn), <a>Kinnick Stadium</a>, and <a>Carver-Hawkeye Arena</a> are located on the west campus.</p>
<p>The Oakdale Campus, which is home to some of the university's research facilities and the driving simulator, is located north of <a>Interstate 80</a> in adjacent <a>Coralville</a>.</p>
<p>The flood of 2008 had a major impact on a number of campus buildings, forcing many building to temporarily close. The Iowa Memorial Union was closed for a period of time, and the ground floor of this building is still closed as it undergoes renovation. The arts campus, which includes Hancher, Voxman and Clapp, and the Theatre Building, was hit especially hard. The theatre building has since reopened, but the music facilities have not. Music classes were for a short time held in temporary trailers, and now music classrooms are spread throughout campus. Recently, a University task force suggested to state regents that Hancher be rebuilt near its current site on the West bank of the Iowa River and Voxman and Clapp be built nearer to the main campus on South Clinton Street.</p>
<h3>The Pentacrest</h3>
<p> The Pentacrest is sometimes referred to as the center of academic life at the University, especially for Liberal Arts students. It is composed of five buildings; the Old Capitol and four lecture halls, Schaeffer, Macbride, MacLean, and Jessup. A variety of classes are held in these four buildings, mostly relating to the Liberal Arts. Macbride Hall and the Old Capitol also contain museums of natural history and Iowa state history, respectively.</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The University of Iowa is one of the EPA's Green Power Partners, burning oat hulls instead of coal and reducing coal consumption by 20%. In May 2004 the university joined the Chicago Climate Exchange, and in April 2009 a student garden was opened.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Much of the student night-life in Iowa City is centered around the pedestrian mall, the ped mall, which contains numerous restaurants, local shops/boutiques, and over thirty bars of different styles for every personality. Another popular university event that draws both students and also a vast number of residents from the entire midwest is home football games. A common activity that many students engage in is tailgating, which many students begin promptly as the sun rises. The University of Iowa is well known for its party and social scene, and was given the rank of 10th-best party school in the United States by Playboy magazine in 2010, in addition to being in the top ten lists of several other publications. A famous motto heard on most nights during the school year is &quot;In heaven there is no beer. That's why we drink it here.&quot; In addition, there are hundreds of student organizations, including groups focused on politics, sports, games, lifestyles, dance, song, and theater, and a variety of other activities. The University also tries to sponsor events that give students an alternative to the typical drinking scene. In 2004 the University established an annual $25,000 contract with the newly reopened <a>Iowa City Englert Theatre</a> to host concerts and performances for as many as 40 nights a year.</p>
<p>Students also participate in a variety of student media organizations.  Students edit and manage The Daily Iowan (often called the DI), which is printed every Monday through Friday while classes are in session.  An early editor of the DI was noted pollster <a>George Gallup</a>.  Daily Iowan TV, KRUI radio, Student Video Productions, Off Deadline magazine and Earthwords magazine are other examples of student-run media. </p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|University of Iowa mascot, Herky.</a> <a>thumb|Iowa Hawkeyes logo.</a> The school's sports teams, the <a>Hawkeyes</a>, participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I-A and in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a>.

<h3>Football</h3>
<p> <a>Iowa's football</a> team plays its home games at <a>Kinnick Stadium</a>, named after former Iowa football player <a>Nile Kinnick</a> who won the <a>Heisman Trophy</a> in 1939. Kinnick Stadium hosts 70,585 fans. The stadium unveiled a new look in 2006 with the completion of a $90 million renovation. The renovation included new stands in the south endzone, a new press box, and a statue of Kinnick.</p>
<p><a>Kirk Ferentz</a> has been the head coach of the football program since 1999, when he replaced longtime coach <a>Hayden Fry</a>. Under Ferentz, the Hawkeyes have enjoyed national success, making eight bowl games in the last nine years, including a <a>Bowl Championship Series</a> victory in the <a>FedEx Orange Bowl</a> over Georgia Tech in 2010. The program has also finished in the Top 10 four times and shared two Big Ten championships in the Ferentz era.</p>
<p>Iowa battles <a>Iowa State University</a> annually for the <a>Cy-Hawk Trophy</a>, a traveling award. Iowa also has a traditional rivalry with <a>Minnesota</a>. The two schools' football teams meet yearly to battle for <a>Floyd of Rosedale</a>, a traveling trophy in the shape of a bronzed pig. In 2004, Iowa and <a>Wisconsin</a> unveiled the <a>Heartland Trophy</a>, a bronze bull, to be played for in their rivalry.</p>
<h3>Wrestling</h3>
<p> Iowa is famous for its extremely successful <a>collegiate wrestling</a> program. Through 2010, the Hawkeyes wrestling team has won 23 national titles and 34 Big Ten titles. Coach <a>Dan Gable</a>'s Gang won nine straight <a>NCAA team championships</a> (1978 to 1986) and three times won three in a row (1991 to 1993, 1995 to 1997, and 2008 to 2010). Iowa's 51 NCAA Champions have won a total of 77 NCAA individual titles, crowning six three-time and 15 two-time champions. Furthermore, Iowa's 132 all-Americans have earned <a>all-America</a> status 269 times, including 16 four-time, 29 three-time and 34 two-time honorees. <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> named the Iowa program one of the top sports dynasties of the 20th century. [<a>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/05/06/top_dynasties/</a>] <a>Tom Brands</a>, a four-time All-American and Olympic gold medalist, is the current head wrestling coach.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> The <a>Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball</a> team currently plays in 15,500-seat <a>Carver-Hawkeye Arena</a>, along with the school's women's basketball, <a>wrestling</a>, and volleyball teams.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the Hawkeyes have enjoyed the successes of eight Big Ten regular season conference championships, the last coming in 1979. More recently, Iowa has won the Big Ten <a>tournament</a> twice, in 2001 and 2006. Iowa also has 22 <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> appearances, including three <a>Final Fours</a>, reaching the semifinals in 1955 and 1980 and playing in the championship game against the <a>University San Francisco</a> in 1956.</p>
<p>The team experienced success in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s under <a>head coach</a>es <a>Lute Olson</a> and <a>Tom Davis</a>. <a>Fran McCaffery</a> is the current head men's basketball coach.</p>
<h3>Women's basketball</h3>
<p>The Iowa Hawkeye women's basketball team experienced great success in the 1980s and early 1990s under coach <a>C. Vivian Stringer</a>. In 1985, the Hawkeyes became the first women's basketball team in history to sellout in advance.[<a>http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/news/story?page=dish2005_1</a>] During Stringer's tenure, the Hawkeyes appeared in 10 Women's NCAA Tournaments, including 9 consecutive berths from 1985-86 through 1993&ndash;94. Additionally, the Hawkeyes appeared in the 1993 Women's Final Four, losing to the Ohio State Buckeyes in the semifinals. Stringer's successor at Iowa, Angie Lee, took Iowa to an additional 3 NCAA tournaments, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance during the 1995-96 season. Current coach Lisa Bluder has taken the Hawkeyes to five NCAA tournaments and two <a>WNIT</a> berths, including an appearance in the WNIT semifinals during the 2004&ndash;2005 season.
