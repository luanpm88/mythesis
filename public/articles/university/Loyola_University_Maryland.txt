<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>[[Image:John early.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Early (educator)|John Early]], founder of Loyola.]] Loyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the <a>Society of Jesus</a>, and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of <a>St. Ignatius of Loyola</a>. Loyola College in Maryland is the ninth-oldest among the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The college's first campus was on Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore. In 1855, Loyola relocated to a larger facility in the city's historic Mount Vernon neighborhood, and moved to its present Evergreen campus in north Baltimore in 1922. Evening classes commenced in 1942.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>In 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973. Today, the college's list of graduate programs has grown to include psychology, modern studies, pastoral counseling, computer science, and software engineering.</p>
<p>Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with <a>Mount Saint Agnes College</a>, a neighboring women's college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining. That same year, the college's Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.</p>
<p>Working from these foundations, Loyola has transformed itself from a small, commuter college into a residential college with an undergraduate population of more than 3,000 students. In 1981, Loyola established a separate business school: The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, Jr., School of Business and Management. The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.</p>
<h3>Designation change</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the college's <a>Board of Trustees</a> announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution's name to Loyola University Maryland. Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the <a>Maryland Higher Education Commission</a>, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19. The <a>Reverend</a> <a>Brian F. Linnane</a>, the <a>university</a>'s <a>president</a>, stated that the &quot;<a>college</a>&quot; designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with <a>graduate programs</a>, was better reflected in its new name. Some alumni were disappointed because they felt the change made the institution less distinct from <a>Loyola University Chicago</a>, <a>Loyola University New Orleans</a> and <a>Loyola Marymount University</a>.</p>
<h3>Jesuit tradition</h3>
<p>[[Image:Ignatius Loyola.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ignatius of Loyola]]]]  Loyola University Maryland was founded by the Society of Jesus in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola. The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate <em><a>Ad maiorem Dei gloriam</a></em> (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the &quot;greater glory of God&quot;. This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular. Loyola's focus on <a>cura personalis</a>, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end. A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.</p>
<p>In keeping with this overarching principle, Loyola undergraduates must complete the core curriculum which includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, natural science, and social sciences.  The endowment mainly supports academic programs and scholarships. Major contributions include a $1 million grant from the <a>Jack Kent Cooke</a> Foundation to increase enrollment of low income students. By June 2005, the campaign reached $93 million.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>The foundation of a Loyola education is a broad core program that covers basic knowledge and concepts in the humanities, math and science, and the social sciences. The purpose is to balance general education and specialized study in the major. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in three schools, Loyola College, the School of Education, and the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management.</p>
<h3>Loyola College</h3>
<p>Coinciding with the university's transition to its new name, the College of Arts and Sciences became Loyola College on August 19, 2009.</p>
<h3>School of Education</h3>
<p>Since 1946 the department of education has been one of the stronger academic pillars at Loyola. With the 2009 name designation change, President Linnane announced the opening of The School of Education which was to be led by Peter C. Murell, Jr. as the first dean. The School was officially opened on October 14, 2009. The School now offers undergraduate majors in Elementary Education and minors in Secondary Education and Special Education. Its graduate department offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (M.Ed.), the Certificate of Advanced Study in School Management (C.S.M.), and the Certificate of Advanced Study in Education (CASE).</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>  More than 10,000 students apply for admission as freshmen for approximately 1,000 spaces. Strong grade performance is particularly emphasized in Loyola&#x2019;s admission evaluation. Loyola students typically have achieved a 3.5 grade point average in their high school work, and are evaluated based on the rigor of their high school cirriculum. The SAT average of the class is usually in the range of around 1200, a score that ranks in the upper 20% for all college-bound students nationwide.</p>
<p>The class of 2013 was the last applicant class that was required to submit SAT scores. The admission office has now begun a four-year pilot program that does not require standardized test scores, deeming them optional.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Humanities Center</a> Loyola's Evergreen campus spans  along Charles Street in northern Baltimore. In addition, Loyola has two satellite campuses in Timonium and Columbia for graduate classes. The college also owns  in the mountains of western Maryland, used for the Rising Phoenix Retreat Center. The Loyola Clinical Centers are located just a short drive from the college&#x2019;s main campus, in Belvedere Square. The Clinical Centers offer individuals in the community a broad range of services addressing educational, language, and psychological issues.</p>
<p>At the western side of the Quad on the Evergreen campus lies the Alumni Memorial Chapel. Formally dedicated on September 15, 1952, the chapel features Gothic architectural influences with large stained-glass windows and a long, narrow nave situated along the east-west axis. A statue of Our Lady of Evergreen, Queen of Peace, is situated above the front fa&#x00e7;ade.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the Quad, and in the center of campus, is the Tudor-style Humanities Center, originally built by the Garrett family in 1895 as a wedding gift for one of their children. Unfortunately, the child died during a trip to England, and the residence became a rehabilitation center for men blinded during the war. In 1921, Loyola's Jesuits purchased the Evergreen property from the Garretts and gradually moved the college from its location on Calvert Street. The mansion was originally used for classes, but then became the Jesuit residence. In 1955, it suffered severe fire damage and was converted to offices following the restoration. Today, the Humanities Center houses 16 departments, including Admissions, Alumni Relations, Financial Aid and the Philosophy, Theology, and History departments.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|A sign bearing the university's name outside of the Fitness and Aquatics Center.</a>On the northern side of the Quad lies the Sellinger School of Business and Management, which opened in January 2000. The  facility features a more contemporary style, with Spanish influences, including a soaring, five-story glass fa&#x00e7;ade, open atrium, a four-story glass tower, and three seminar rooms.</p>
<p>On the southern side of the Quad lies Beatty Hall, Jenkins Hall, and Xavier Hall. Each of these buildings, used to house classrooms and various departments, is heavily influenced by Gothic and Edwardian architectural styles.</p>
<p>The dormitories housing students are located west of the main campus, and are connected by Loyola's pedestrian bridge (or USF&amp;G Pedestrian Bridge), spanning Charles Street. Loyola's dormitories, in most cases purchased apartment buildings, include Newman Towers, Campion Tower, and Seton Court. Further up North Charles Street is the Fitness and Aquatic Center, which opened in fall 2000, featuring a  fitness center with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, stair climbers, free weights, selectorized weight circuit and stretching area. The Mangione Aquatic Center features an eight-lane,  swim course; a shallow lane and diving well; as well as an on-deck sauna and hot tub. The  indoor rock climbing wall and bouldering area is designed for all levels.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The FAC also has a two-court gymnasium used for club sports, intramural sports, and informal recreation. The Multi-Activity Court features a sport court surface ideal for indoor soccer, volleyball, and inline sports. The FAC also features an elevated walking/jogging track, two group exercise studios, an Outdoor Adventure Center, classroom and conference room, an equipment room, locker rooms, four racquetball and two squash courts, and an outdoor grass field.</p>
<p>Loyola shares with the <a>College of Notre Dame of Maryland</a> the Loyola Notre Dame Library, located between the two schools, and features a  interior; interactive study and instructional spaces; an exhibition area and curatorial space for special collections; expanded stack areas for humanities print collection; a caf&#x00e9; fully wired for voice, data, and video; five high-tech seminar rooms; digital studio for collaborative student and faculty projects; a media center with 96-seat auditorium; and a 24-seat, fully wired bibliographic classroom.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The University employs a full-time staff member dedicated to advancing sustainability on campus. Two roof-top <a>solar panels</a> were installed during the summer of 2008, and a green residence hall features recycled metal beams, a green roof, and <a>geothermal</a> heating and cooling. The student groups  Environmental Action Club, Roots and Shoots, and Justice Club work to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability on campus. Loyola also partners with a hybrid-only taxi service to provide additional transportation resources.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Loyola's undergraduate body is composed of 3,580 students as of 2008. The racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 85.0% <a>white</a>, 2.7% <a>Asian</a>, 5.1% <a>black</a>, and 3.4% <a>Hispanic</a>. Ninety-eight percent of freshmen and 81% of all undergraduate students live in college housing.</p>

Students take one class and one lab each week, plus physical fitness training three times per week. Courses cover everything from the structure of the Army to military operations and tactics. Upon completion of the program, cadets are commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army and must complete a period of service in either the Active Duty, Army Reserve or Army National Guard. Since its inception in 1952, the ROTC program has commissioned more than 1,100 cadets. Loyola's Army ROTC program has a partnership with <a>Towson University</a>, the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, and <a>Goucher College</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of the student population has participated in some community service activity during their time at Loyola. The Center for Community Service and Justice engages students by developing service opportunities in a wide variety of areas. The center offers nearly 40 ongoing community service programs, more than 15 one-time service opportunities throughout the year, and several immersion programs. Students also have an opportunity to become involved through service learning, which pairs community service with academic coursework.</p>

Loyola's <a>men's</a> and women's lacrosse teams are particularly noteworthy as both have appeared in numerous NCAA tournaments, and are highly ranked most years. The <a>men's soccer team</a> has also enjoyed a great deal of success over time, winning the NCAA Division II National Championship in 1976, appearing various times in the NCAA Division I Tournament, and garnering several national rankings since its ascension into Division I in 1978.</p>
<p><a>Philip Scholz</a>, a paralympian, competes on the varsity men's swimming team. Scholz is blind and holds various records for paralympian swimmers.  <a>Katie Hoff</a>, an Olympic medal winner, coached swimming at Loyola and attended classes at the school before leaving Baltimore to live in <a>Fullerton</a>, <a>California</a>. <a>Brennan Morris</a>, a member of the US National Team, is also a record-setting member of the swim team.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Loyola men's basketball team has a long history and has been playing since the 1908-1909 season. In all that time, the team has appeared only once, <a>1994</a>, in the NCAA tournament. The team plays its games in <a>Reitz Arena</a> and is coached by <a>Jimmy Patsos</a>, who inherited a team that won one game in the season prior to his arrival. In 2007, Patsos' fourth season as head coach, the team had a record of 19 wins and 14 losses.</p>
<h3>Lacrosse</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Loyola men's lacrosse team has played since 1938, with a two year break in 1944 and 1945, winning over 400 games in that time.  The Loyola women's lacrosse program is fifth all-time among NCAA Division I women's lacrosse teams with 362 wins. </p>
<h3>Men's soccer</h3>
<p> The Loyola Men's Soccer team, coached by <a>Mark Mettrick</a>, has consistently proven to be one of the most successful teams in the athletic department.  Since 1965, the team has suffered only four losing seasons.  The team is a perennial power in the MAAC and has reached the NCAA Division I National Tournament seven times since joining Division I in 1979, including quarterfinal appearances in 1986 and 1987 and a Sweet 16 appearance in 2001.  Loyola enjoyed an undefeated regular season in 2008 before being upset in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.  Former Greyhounds include the 2009 Major League Soccer Goalkeeper of the Year, <a>Zach Thornton</a> as well as many others who have played in the MLS and other professional leagues.</p>
<h3>Rugby football club</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Spring 2007 season play</a> The Loyola College Rugby Football Club is the men's rugby union team that represents Loyola College in the <a>Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union</a>. The club is composed of over 50 student-athletes, alumni volunteers, and professional trainers. Founded in 1976 by a group of Loyola students, LCRFC continues to be the oldest and most active club sport at the college. LCRFC and its players have gained many All-American titles and U.S. Rugby rankings.</p>
<p>The Greyhound ruggers have also traveled abroad to play Irish teams, including teams in <a>Limerick</a>, <a>Dublin</a>, and <a>Cork</a>.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Loyola's football program has been defunct since 1933. Since the recent construction of the $62 million Rev. Harold Ridley, S.J. Intercollegiate Athletic Complex, there has been much speculation as to whether Loyola will also begin a football program. This could also possibly involve a move to the Patriot League.</p>
