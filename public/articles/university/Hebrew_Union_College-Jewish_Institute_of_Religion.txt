<h2>History</h2>
<p>HUC was founded in 1875 under the leadership of Rabbi <a>Isaac Mayer Wise</a> in <a>Cincinnati, Ohio</a>.  The first rabbinical class graduated in 1883.  The graduation banquet for this class included food that was not <a>kosher</a>, such as <a>clams</a>, <a>soft-shell crabs</a>, <a>shrimp</a>, <a>frogs' legs</a> and dairy products served immediately after meat.  This feast was known as the <em>treifah</em> banquet.  At the time, Reform <a>rabbis</a> were split over the question of whether the Jewish dietary restrictions were still applicable.  Some of the more traditionalist Reform rabbis thought the banquet menu went too far, and were compelled to find an alternative between Reform Judaism and <a>Orthodox Judaism</a>.  This was a major cause of the founding of American <a>Conservative Judaism</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2009, the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion is an international seminary and university of graduate studies offering a wide variety of academic and professional programs. In addition to its Rabbinical School, the College-Institute includes Schools of Graduate Studies, Education, Jewish Communal Service, <a>sacred music</a>, <a>Biblical archaeology</a> and an <a>Israel</a>i rabbinical program.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles campus operates many of its programs and degrees in cooperation with the neighboring <a>University of Southern California</a>, a partnership that has lasted over 35 years. Their productive relationship includes the creation of The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement which is a inter-faith think tank through the partnership of HUC, USC and Omar Foundation. CMJE holds religious text-study programs across Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Rabbi <a>Alfred Gottschalk</a> was appointed as HUC's sixth president, following the death of <a>Nelson Glueck</a>. As president, Gottschalk oversaw the growth and expansion of the HUC campuses, the ordination of <a>Sally Priesand</a> as the first woman Rabbi in the United States, as well as the investiture of reform Judaism's first woman <a>hazzan</a> and the ordination of <a>Naamah Kelman</a> as the first woman rabbi in <a>Israel</a>.</p>
