<p>The <strong>National University of Singapore</strong> (<a>Abbreviation</a>: <strong>NUS</strong>; ; ; Abbreviated &#x56fd;&#x5927;; ) is <a>Singapore</a>'s oldest <a>university</a>. It is the largest university in the country in terms of student enrollment and curriculum offered.</p>
<p>The university's main campus is located in southwest Singapore at <a>Kent Ridge</a>, with an area of approximately 1.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2; (0.6 square miles). The Bukit Timah campus houses the <a>law faculty</a>, while the <a>Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School</a> Singapore is located at the Outram campus.</p>
<p>The former <a>British Prime Minister</a> <a>Tony Blair</a> has recently named NUS as the headquarters of his Asian Faith and Globalization Initiative together with <a>Durham University</a> in the UK and <a>Yale University</a> in the USA to deliver an exclusive programme in partnership with <a>Tony Blair Faith Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The university is considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in Asia. In 2010, the <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> ranked the university the 34th in the world and 4th in Asia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>In September 1904, <a>Tan Jiak Kim</a> led a group of representatives of the <a>Chinese</a> and other non-European communities, and <a>petition</a>ed the <a>Governor of the Straits Settlements</a>, Sir <a>John Anderson</a>, to establish a medical school in <a>Singapore</a>. Tan, who was the first president of the <a>Straits Chinese</a> British Association, managed to raise <a>$</a>87,077, of which the largest amount of $12,000 came from himself. On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded, and was known as the <em>Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School</em>. The <a>medical library</a> was first housed in the students' <a>reading room</a> within the school, converted from the vacant old female <a>lunatic</a> <a>asylum</a> in <a>Sepoy Lines</a>.</p>
<p>In 1912, the medical school received an <a>endowment</a> of $120,000 from the <a>King Edward VII</a> Memorial Fund, started by Dr <a>Lim Boon Keng</a>. Subsequently on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to the <em>King Edward VII Medical School</em>. In 1921, it was again changed to the <em>King Edward VII College of Medicine</em> to reflect its <a>academic</a> status.</p>
<p>In 1929, <a>Raffles College</a> was established to promote <a>art</a>s and <a>social sciences</a> at tertiary level for Malayan students.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the university</h3>
<p><a>right|150px|thumb|Block EA, Faculty of Engineering</a></p>
<p>Two decades later, <a>Raffles College</a> was merged with the King Edward VII College of Medicine to form the <a>University of Malaya</a> on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the <a>Federation of Malaya</a> and <a>Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>The growth of UM was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in <a>Singapore</a> and the other in <a>Kuala Lumpur</a>.</p>
<p>In 1960, the governments of then <a>Federation of Malaya</a> and <a>Singapore</a> indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university. Legislation was passed in 1961 establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.</p>
<h3>Present form</h3>
<p>The National University of Singapore was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and <a>Nanyang University</a> in 1980. This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity, and promote the <a>English language</a> as Singapore's only main language. The original crest of <a>Nanyang University</a> with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.</p>
<p>The merger of the two universities was met with strong opposition from the <a>Nanyang University</a>'s alumni in particular, as well as the Chinese community. They considered Nanyang University a people's university due to their financial contributions in establishing and maintaining it. The Chinese community also believed the university to be a bastion of Chinese education, culture, and social development. Since inception till its dissolution, Nanyang University was the only tertiary institute outside of <a>China</a> and <a>Taiwan</a> offering education in <a>Mandarin Chinese</a>.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>NUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as <a>small group</a> teaching (<a>tutorial</a>s) and the American system (<a>course credit</a>s). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts &amp; Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts &amp; Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law.</p>

The Library Portal, a one-stop gateway, offers the university community 24-hour access via the Internet to a rich array of electronic collection and services provided by the NUS Libraries. Besides the rich resources, the NUS Libraries provide an environment conducive for individual research and spaces for group interaction and learning.</p>
<h3>Support for development of teaching and learning</h3>
<p>Enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning at NUS comes mainly under the purview of the <strong>Centre for Development of Teaching and Learning (CDTL)</strong> and the <strong>Centre for Instructional Technology (CIT)</strong>.</p>
<p>CDTL facilitates reflection among faculty on concepts of teaching, learning and university education, and teaching practices that are consistent with these concepts. In addition to conducting research on educational philosophy, pedagogical theory and educational practices, CDTL helps the NUS administration to formulate educational policies for matters such as teacher appraisal, peer review, selection of outstanding educators, student feedback and assessment.</p>
<p>CIT, on the other hand, provides for the exploration, development and application of digital and audio-visual technologies to support and enhance teaching and learning. This is done through the NUS-developed Integrated Virtual Learning Environment and by developing new applications/services and incorporating multimedia content in courses for academia.</p>
<h3>NUS University Town and Residential Colleges</h3>
<p>In November, 2005, NUS announced plans to develop the &quot;University Town&quot; on a 190,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2; site of the former Warren <a>Golf Course</a>, opposite the existing Kent Ridge Campus and NUS High School. Eight <a>Residential College</a>s, which will provide &quot;rich educational experiences&quot; and cultivate &quot;deep social bonds&quot; as well as two Graduate Residences will be built. In all, the NUS University Town will accommodate 6,000 students. A vehicular-cum-pedestrian bridge spanning over the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) will connect both campuses seamlessly. Construction began in 2007. The University Town construction was delayed due to the volatile construction environment of 2007, and thus will not be used as the Olympic Village for the Youth Olympics in 2010; much to the disappointment of the entire NUS community. The University Town is now scheduled to be completed in phases from 2011 to 2013.</p>
<h2>Student accommodation</h2>

<p>There are about 6,000 residential places distributed between Halls and Student Residences on campus. There is a free Internal Shuttle Bus Service that plies the entire campus seven days a week.</p>
<p>Rooms are furnished with beds, mattresses, wardrobes, study tables, bookshelves and fans. There is a very small number of air-conditioned single rooms with attached bathrooms. Points for telephone, cable television and the university's computer network are available in each room. The accommodation is divided into single room (single-occupancy) or double room (double-occupancy). Laundry rooms equipped with washing machines and coin-operated tumble dryers are located in each student accommodation.</p>
<h3>Halls of residence</h3>
<p>NUS has 6 Halls of Residence with about 3,000 residential places. The halls are situated in different parts of the campus and are well known for their vibrancy in Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), rich history and culture.</p>
<p>Each hall has a Senior Common Room Committee (SCRC) comprising the Resident Fellows (staff). Headed by a Hall Master, which is tasked to look after residents' well being. Residents are represented by elected student members to the Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC), which helps to promote the hall's social and cultural life.</p>
