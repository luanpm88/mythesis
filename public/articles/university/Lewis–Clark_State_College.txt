<h2>History</h2>
<p>On January 27, 1893, Idaho Governor <a>William J. McConnell</a> signed an Act authorizing the establishment of the Lewiston State Normal School in Lewiston. There was a catch, however: &quot;Provided the mayor and common council of that city on or before May 1, 1893, donate ten acres, within the city limits and known as part of the city park, and authorizing the said mayor and council to convey to the trustees of said normal school the said tract of land,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>The first Trustees on the school's Board were James W. Reid (who had done the most to shepherd the authorization bill through the legislature), Norman B. Willey (who had just stepped down as Idaho governor), Benjamin Wilson (a previous gubernatorial candidate), J. Morris Howe, and C. W. Schaff. Reid was elected President of the Board , a position he held until his death in 1902.</p>
<p>Lewiston residents lost no time in obtaining the required space for the school. However, the legislature acted slowly in providing construction funds, and then construction lagged. George E. Knepper</li>
