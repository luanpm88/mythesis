<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>[[File:TTUadmin1925.jpg|left|thumb|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] (c. 1925)]] The call to open a college in <a>West Texas</a> began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of <a>Texas A&amp;M</a> to be located in <a>Abilene</a>. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that <a>Governor James E. Ferguson</a> had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, <a>Governor Pat Neff</a> vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state.</p>
<p>In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university would better serve the needs of the region.  On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site. That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including <a>Floydada</a>, <a>Plainview</a>, and <a>Sweetwater</a>. With an enrollment of 914 students&#x2014;both men and women&#x2014;Texas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925. It was originally composed of four schools&#x2014;Agriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts.</p>
<p>Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal <a>Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> training did not commence until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Though enrollment declined during <a>World War II</a>, Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its <a>armed forces</a> training detachments.</p>
<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p>[[File:TTUadmin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]]]] By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects. The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to &quot;Texas State University&quot;, feeling the phrase &quot;Technological College&quot; was insufficient to define the scope of the institution. While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the <a>Double T</a>, opposed it. Other names&#x2014;University of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University, and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technology&#x2014;were considered, but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964. A failed move by <a>Governor John Connally</a> to have the school placed into the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>, as well as continued disagreement and heated debate regarding the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved.</p>
<p>The university was <a>integrated</a> in 1961 when three <a>African-American</a> students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a subsequent lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit &quot;all qualified applicants regardless of color&quot;. The university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student in 1967, when Danny Hardaway was recruited to play for the Red Raiders football team. In 1970, Hortense W. Dixon became the first African-American student to earn a doctorate from the university.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the university invested <a>US$</a>150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded. On May 29, 1969, the <a>61st Texas Legislature</a> created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine. The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the <a>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center</a>. TTUHSC, which is now part of the <a>Texas Tech University System</a>, includes Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. It has locations in four Texas cities in addition to the main campus in Lubbock.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|English and Philosophy Building</a> In 1996, the Texas Tech Board of Regents created the Texas Tech University System. Former <a>State Senator</a> <a>John T. Montford</a>, later of <a>San Antonio</a>, was selected as the first <a>chancellor</a> to lead the combined academic enterprise. Regents Chair <a>Edward Whitacre, Jr.</a>, stated that the move was made due to the size and complexity of the institution. &quot;It's time&quot;, he said, &quot;to take the university into the 21st century...&quot; <a>Kent Hance</a>, a former <a>United States Congressman</a> and Texas Tech University graduate, assumed the duties of chancellor on December 1, 2006.</p>
<p>Even though growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy. In 2003, a third-year student at the <a>Texas Tech School of Law</a> filed suit against the university over its policy on <a>free speech zone</a>s, which restricted student speech to a single &quot;free speech gazebo&quot;. The following year, a <a>federal judge</a> declared the policy <a>unconstitutional</a>.</p>
<p>To meet the demands of its increased enrollment and expanding research, the university has invested more than $548 million in new construction since 2000. It has also received more than $65.9 million in private donations. On September 2, 2009, the university announced that it had received private gifts totaling $24.3 million. Of these, $21.5 million are eligible for match under the Texas Research Incentive Program. <img></p>
<h2>Academic profile</h2>
<p>  By enrollment, Texas Tech is the sixth largest university in Texas and the largest institution of higher education in the western two-thirds of the state.

In 2004, the <a>College of Mass Communications</a> and the <a>College of Visual and Performing Arts</a> were created from programs that had belonged to the College of Arts and Sciences. The College of Mass Communications offers degrees in several areas, including journalism, advertising, and public relations. Programs offered through the College of Visual and Performing Arts are accredited by the <a>National Association of Schools of Art and Design</a>, the <a>National Association of Schools of Music</a>, and the National Association of Schools of Theatre.</p>
<p>Once the Division of Home Economics, the <a>College of Human Sciences</a> now offers degrees in applied and professional studies, design, human development, nutrition, hospitality, and retailing. The <a>College of Architecture</a> was founded in 1927 and offers programs accredited by the <a>National Architectural Accrediting Board</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Rawls College of Business</a>, which is accredited by the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a>, is the university's business school. In 2009, <em><a>Business Week</a></em> ranked it 36th best among approximately 800 U.S. public business schools. The school offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in business disciplines. From its origin in 1942, the business school was known as the Division of Commerce, until it was renamed the College of Business Administration in 1956. In 2000, following a $25 million gift from alumnus Jerry S. Rawls, the school was formally renamed the Jerry S. Rawls College of Business Administration. In 2008, the law school had an 89.1% <a>bar exam</a> pass rate, placing it 49th among U.S. law schools. Most recently, <a>Texas Tech University School of Law</a> led all Texas law schools on the July 2009 Bar Examination, with a first-time pass rate of 94.52 percent. Texas Tech's six in-state satellite campuses are under the auspices of the college. Additionally, it oversees the <a>Texas Tech University Independent School District</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Texas Tech University System</a> also operates a medical school, the <a>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center</a>.

Further, the Health Sciences Center is located on the university's main campus in Lubbock. In addition to the Lubbock campus, TTUHSC has campuses located in <a>Abilene</a>, <a>Amarillo</a>, <a>El Paso</a>, and <a>Odessa</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Texas Tech, in collaboration with Harvard University, has developed a treatment that may be a cure for HIV.</a></p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Classified by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> as a research university with &quot;high activity&quot;, Texas Tech University hosts 60 research centers and institutes. In 2008, a team of researchers from Texas Tech University and <a>Harvard University</a> announced the development of an <a>siRNA</a>-based treatment that may ultimately counteract the <a>human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</a>. Human cells infected with HIV, injected into rats, have been cured by the experimental treatment. Clinical trials on humans are expected to begin by 2010. Texas Tech researchers also hold the exclusive license for HemoTech, a human <a>blood substitute</a> composed of <a>bovine</a> <a>hemoglobin</a>. HemoBioTech, the company marketing the technology, believes that HemoTech will diminish the intrinsic toxicities that have stifled previous attempts to develop a human blood substitute. On January 14, 2008, Texas Tech University announced the creation of the West Texas Influenza Research Center. The university has concluded human clinical testing of oral <a>interferon</a> in a five-year study of <a>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</a> and continues its study of <a>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>.</p>
<p>Following the May 11, 1970, <a>Lubbock Tornado</a> that caused 26 fatalities and over $100 million in damage in Lubbock, the <a>Wind Science and Engineering Research Center</a> (WISE) was established. The WISE Center, which includes  of indoor laboratory space, is focused on research, education, and information outreach. The interdisciplinary research program studies methods to exploit the beneficial qualities of wind and to mitigate its detrimental effects. The center offers education in wind-science and engineering to develop professionals who are experts in creating designs which deal effectively with problems caused by high winds. WISE Center researchers contributed significantly to the development of the <a>Enhanced Fujita Scale</a> for rating the strength of tornadoes.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Texas Tech alumnus Rick Husband was the final commander of the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em>.</a> Texas Tech has made numerous contributions to <a>NASA</a> projects. Daniel Cooke, Computer Science Department Chair, and his colleagues are working to develop the technical content of the Intelligent Systems Program, and have been awarded a five-year budget valued at $350 million. University scientists have also teamed with NASA's guidance, navigation, and control engineers to develop the Onboard Abort Executive (OAE), software capable of quickly deciding the best course of action during an ascent failure. The Texas Tech Space Research Initiative has also partnered with NASA to perfect methods for growing fresh vegetables in space and to determine the most efficient ways to recycle wastewater.  In November 1996, the university dedicated the Charles A. Bassett II Pulse Laboratory to honor engineering alumnus and <a>Gemini</a>-era astronaut <a>Charles A. Bassett II</a>.  In total, Texas Tech has helped to produce four astronauts: Bassett, <a>Bernard A. Harris, Jr.</a>, <a>Paul Lockhart</a>, and <a>Rick Husband</a>, the final commander of space shuttle <em><a>Columbia</a></em>.</p>
<p>In 2008, the <a>pulsed power</a> electronics laboratory received $4 million in federal funding. Among other things, the money will be used to create compact generators for weapon systems designed to destroy <a>improvised explosive devices</a> (IEDs). The College of Engineering&#x2019;s Nano Tech Center has received approximately $20 million in grants toward its work in applied <a>nanophotonics</a>, the creation and manipulation of advanced materials at the <a>nanoscale</a> that can produce and sense light. Texas Tech's Center for Advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence performs <a>grid computing</a> research through collaboration with the <a>SAS Institute</a> that seeks to improve the speed with which large quantities of data (such as those present in <a>genomics</a> and global economics) can be processed.</p>
<p>Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources has received state and federal grants for research projects including the fiber properties of cotton, the antibacterial properties of cotton fabric, and the development of chemical-warfare protective fabrics. The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant <a>turf grass</a> that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of <a>Bermuda</a> and the resilience of <a>buffalo grass</a>. <img></p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- This section is linked to from Library --&gt;   <a>left|thumb|Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library</a> Situated on , Texas Tech has the second largest contiguous university campus in the United States. The Lubbock campus is home to the main academic university, law school, and medical school (<a>Health Sciences Center</a>). This arrangement makes it the only institution in Texas to have all three units (undergraduate institution, law school, and medical school) on the same campus. The campus, which boasts <a>Spanish Renaissance architecture</a>, was described by American author <a>James A. Michener</a> as the &quot;most beautiful west of the Mississippi until you get to <a>Stanford</a>&quot; and by <a>Stewart Mandel</a> of <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> as &quot;easily one of the ten most beautiful campuses&quot; he had seen. Many buildings on campus borrow architectural elements from those found at <a>University de Alcal&#x00e1;</a> in <a>Alcal&#x00e1; de Henares</a>, Spain, and <a>Mission San Jos&#x00e9;</a> in <a>San Antonio</a>. A large section of the campus built between 1924 and 1951 is listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> as the <a>Texas Technological College Historic District</a>.  This area is roughly bounded by 6th Street on the north, University Avenue on the east, 19th Street on the south, and Flint Street on the west. In 2008, the <a>Professional Grounds Management Society</a> awarded Texas Tech the Grand Award for excellence in grounds-keeping.</p>
<p>In 1998 the <a>Board of Regents</a> created the <a>Texas Tech University Public Art Collection</a> to enliven the campus environment and extend the educational mission of the university. It is funded by using one percent of the estimated total cost of each new building on campus. The collection features pieces from artists such as <a>Tom Otterness</a> and <a>Glenna Goodacre</a>. The Texas Tech University Public Art Collection is ranked among the ten best university public art collections in the United States by Public Art Review. <a>thumb|Pfluger Fountain</a></p>
<p>The university also hosts the <a>Museum of Texas Tech University</a>, which was founded in 1929 and is accredited by the <a>American Association of Museums</a>. The museum is home to over three million objects and specimens and houses the Moody Planetarium, art galleries, a sculpture court, and a natural science research laboratory. The museum also operates the <a>Val Verde County</a> research site and the <a>Lubbock Lake Landmark</a>, an archaeological site and natural history preserve in the city of Lubbock. The site has evidence of 12,000 years of use by ancient cultures on the <a>Llano Estacado</a> (Southern High Plains), and allows visitors to watch active archaeological digs. Visiting scientists and tourists may also participate in the discovery process. Lubbock Lake Landmark is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>, which lists it on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a designated State Archaeological Landmark. Texas Tech is also the location of the Southwest Collection of historical archives and the sponsoring institution of the <a>West Texas Historical Association</a>. Located on the northern edge of the campus is the <a>National Ranching Heritage Center</a>, a museum of ranching history. The site spans  and is home to 38 historic structures that have been restored to their original condition. Structures represented at the center include: a linecamp, a dugout, a bunkhouse, a blacksmith shop, a cowchip house, a schoolhouse, corrals, shipping pens, windmills, chuckwagons, and a coal-burning locomotive.</p>
<p>The university maintains a number of libraries, some general-purpose and some dedicated to specific topics such as architecture and law. Among the most notable of these are the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library and the <a>Vietnam Center and Archive</a>, the nation's largest and most comprehensive collections of information on the <a>Vietnam War</a>. On August 17, 2007, the Vietnam Center and Archive became the first U.S. institution to sign a formalized exchange agreement with the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam. This opens the door for a two-way exchange between the entities. <img></p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Goin' Band from Raiderland</a> There are over 390 student clubs and organizations at Texas Tech. Many students participate in <a>Greek Life</a>. The Student Union Building, located centrally on campus, is the hub of daily student activity. It houses restaurants, coffee shops, a book store, meeting rooms, lecture halls, movie rooms, and study areas as well as the offices and meeting rooms of several student organizations and the Student Government Association. Directly adjacent to the Student Union Building is the School of Music, home of the Texas Tech <a>Goin' Band from Raiderland</a>. The 450-member band, which was awarded the <a>Sudler Trophy</a> in 1999, performs at all home football games and at various other events.</p>
<p>Approximately 20&nbsp;percent of students live on campus, and most students live on campus for at least a portion of their academic careers. Students with less than 30&nbsp;hours of academic credit are required to live in university housing unless they receive an exemption. Specific dorms and communities exist for graduate students, athletes, and various specific interests and academic disciplines.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Student Union Building</a> International honor societies <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> (liberal arts &amp; sciences),Delta Episolon Psi, <a>Beta Gamma Sigma</a> (business), and <a>Tau Beta Pi</a> (engineering) have chapters at the university. Professional, service, and social fraternities and sororities on campus include <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> (service), <a>Alpha Kappa Psi</a> (business), <a>Delta Sigma Pi</a> (business), <a>Phi Alpha Delta</a> (law), <a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> (music), and <a>Tau Beta Sigma</a> (band).

<p>The university maintains <a>KTXT-FM</a> 88.1, formerly a student radio station focusing on alternative, indie rock, industrial, and hip hop music. After 47 years, the station went off the air on December 10, 2008. It returned in May 2009 with a different format and plans to eventually return to its former style. <a>National Public Radio</a> station <a>KOHM</a> 89.1, which features classical music and news, is also found on campus. Additionally, the university owns and operates <a>Public Broadcasting Service</a> television station <a>KTXT-TV</a>. Students run a daily newspaper, <em><a>The Daily Toreador</a></em>, until 2005 known as <em>The University Daily</em>. The university also produces a yearbook, <em><a>La Ventana</a></em>. <img></p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  Texas Tech's athletic teams are known as the Red Raiders with the exception of the women's basketball team, which is known as the Lady Raiders. Texas Tech competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I FBS</a> (formerly Division I-A) and is a member of the South Division of the <a>Big 12 Conference</a>. From 1932 until 1956, the university belonged to the <a>Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association</a>. After being rejected eight times over a period of more than twenty years, Texas Tech was admitted to the <a>Southwest Conference</a> on May 12, 1956.  When the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1995, Texas Tech, along with the <a>University of Texas at Austin</a>, <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, and <a>Baylor University</a>, merged with schools from the former <a>Big Eight Conference</a> to form the Big 12.</p>
<p><a>thumb|upright|left|Tech in action in 2007</a> Of its varsity sports, Texas Tech's women's <a>basketball</a> team has been the only one to claim a national title. The <a>Lady Raiders</a>, led by player <a>Sheryl Swoopes</a> and head coach <a>Marsha Sharp</a>, won the <a>1993 NCAA Women's Basketball Championship</a>. The <a>men's basketball team</a> has made 14 appearances in the <a>NCAA Men's Division I Tournament</a>. <a>Bob Knight</a> served as men's basketball coach from the beginning of the 2001 season until February 4, 2008. On January 1, 2007, he became the winningest coach in men's <a>NCAA</a> Division I basketball history, when the Red Raiders defeated the <a>New Mexico Lobos</a>, 70&#x2013;68. Upon Knight's retirement, his son <a>Pat Knight</a> became the head coach of the team.</p>
<p>Since 1999, home basketball games have been played at <a>United Spirit Arena</a>, a 15,020-seat multi-purpose facility which cost $62 million to build. In addition to serving as home to the men's and women's basketball teams, the arena is used by the Lady Raiders volleyball team.</p>
<p>The <a>Red Raiders football</a> team, coached by <a>Tommy Tuberville</a>, is a member of the <a>NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision</a> (formerly known as Division I-A). In each of its last fourteen seasons, Tech has finished with a winning record, the fourth-longest such streak in the nation. The Red Raiders have made 33 bowl appearances, which is 18th most of any university. From 1932 to 1956, as members of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Red Raiders won eight conference championships and one co-championship, <a>the most held by a Border Conference member</a>. After joining the Southwest Athletic Conference, the Red Raiders added conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994. The stadium's original <a>seating capacity</a> was 27,000, but it was expanded in 1959, 1972, 2003 and again in 2009. On August 7, 2008, the Texas Tech Board of Regents announced a $25 million expansion project. The expansion added a Spanish Renaissance-themed fa&#x00e7;ade to the east side of the stadium. In addition to the improvements to the exterior of the facility, the expansion added 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suites. Texas Tech allocated a total of $19&nbsp;million to the expansion and planned to add another $6&nbsp;million through fund-raising initiatives. On November 20, 2008, university officials announced that the project's fundraising goal had been exceeded. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the expansion took place on November 29, 2008, and construction began following the <a>2008 football season</a>.  The current seating capacity of the stadium is 60,454, making it the third largest on campus stadium in Texas.</p>
<p>The <a>Red Raiders baseball team</a> played its first game in 1925.  The team has two conference championships, two conference tournament championships, and has made nine <a>NCAA Division I Baseball Championship</a> tournament appearances.  <a>Larry Hays</a> coached the team from 1987 to 2008 and lead the team to a .639 winning percentage. Following Hays&#x2019; retirement on June 2, 2008, Assistant Coach <a>Dan Spencer</a> was promoted to head coach. At least 20 former Red Raiders baseball players have gone on to play in the <a>Major Leagues</a>.  The team plays its home games at <a>Dan Law Field</a>. The field, located on the main campus in Lubbock, has a <a>seating capacity</a> of 5,050.</p>
<p>In addition to varsity sports, the university's Sport Clubs Federation offers 30 recreational and competitive sport clubs, including polo, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>fencing</a>, and <a>soccer</a>. In 2006, Texas Tech beat rival <a>Texas A&amp;M</a> to win the United States Polo Association National Intercollegiate Championship. <img></p>
<h3>Mascots</h3>
<p><a>The Masked Rider</a> is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the <a>Gator Bowl</a>. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the <em><a>Atlanta Journal</a></em> who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot; In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25&nbsp;percent larger than life. <a>left|thumb|The Masked Rider logo</a> Today the Masked Rider, with <a>guns up</a>, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive <a>gaucho</a> hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Christi Chadwell, a sophomore agricultural communications major from <a>Garland</a>, will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2010/11.</p>
<p>Texas Tech's other mascot, <a>Raider Red</a>, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the <a>Saddle Tramps</a> student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist <a>Dirk West</a>, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders. <img></p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Carol of Lights</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Carol of Lights</a> The Carol of Lights is an annual event, traditionally held the first Friday in December, to celebrate the holiday season at the university. The event begins with a Carillon concert, from the 43 bells located in the west tower of the <a>Administration Building</a> followed a torch light processional by the <a>Saddle Tramps</a> and <a>High Riders</a> spirit organizations. The Texas Tech Trombone Choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination  ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of &#x201c;O Holy Night,&#x201d; in the Science Quadrangle. This is followed by the lighting ceremony, where thirteen buildings within the <a>Texas Technological College Historic District</a> are illuminated with the over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights. The lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students come back from the holiday break.</p>
<p>In 1959, Texas Tech Board of Regents member Harold Hinn planned and provided the funding to cover the Science Quadrangle and Administration Building with 5,000 lights. However, students were away on Christmas break and did not see the display. The following year, the Residence Hall Association sponsored the event under the name &quot;Christmas Sing&quot;. In 1961, the event was renamed Carol of Lights and the display increased to 16,000 lights. The tradition has since grown to include decorations like the 38-foot lighted Christmas tree, 3,000 luminaries lining the sidewalks of <a>Memorial Circle</a> and a 21-foot fresh pine wreath hung on the Physics/Geosciences building. The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim.</p>
<p>To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the <a>Administration Building</a>. The logo is further embodied in the Double T <a>neon sign</a>, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.</p>
<h3>Will Rogers and Soapsuds</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|left|Will Rogers and Soapsuds</a> One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of <a>Will Rogers</a> on his horse Soapsuds. The statue, entitled &quot;<a>Riding Into the Sunset</a>&quot;, has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers' longtime friend <a>Amon G. Carter</a>. Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of <a>West Texas</a>.  The statue, estimated to cost $25,000 when it was dedicated, stands  and weighs . The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: &quot;Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.&quot;</p>
<p>The statue continues to be a part of school tradition. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap it with red crepe paper. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crepe paper.</p>
<h3>Texas Tech ring</h3>
<p>While the <a>class ring</a> had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school&#x2019;s full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.</p>
<p>One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the <a>Administration Building</a>, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.</p>
