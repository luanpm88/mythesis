<p><strong>Soochow University</strong> () is a private university located in <a>Taipei</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>. Although the Soochow University in Taiwan maintains a church and a Methodist minister in residence, it may be considered a secular institution. The University's College of Law is considered to be one of the best in Taiwan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original <a>Soochow University</a> was founded by <a>Methodist</a>s in <a>Suzhou</a>, <a>Jiangsu</a> province of <a>Qing Dynasty</a> <a>China</a> in 1900 as a merger of three existing institutions: the Po-hsi Academy, the Kung-hsiang Academy, and the Chung-hsi Academy.</p>
<p>After the <a>Chinese Civil War</a>, members of the Soochow Alumni Association who fled to Taiwan established a new institution in Taiwan in 1951 to make up for the Soochow University lost on the mainland. A law school was opened in 1954, and a full university was certified in 1971.  As the original site of Soochow University was later reestablished as <a>Soochow</a> in 1982, there would be a Soochow University in Taiwan and a Soochow University in Jiangsu.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Front entrance of Main Campus</a> The Soochow University in Taiwan has two branches: a downtown branch located near the ROC presidential office in Taipei's <a>Zhongzheng</a> district and the main campus located near the <a>National Palace Museum</a> in Taipei's <a>Shilin</a> district. The law and business colleges are located in the downtown campus. All other colleges are located in the main campus.</p>
<p>Faculty and student housing are available on the main campus although they cannot meet demand. There are three female student dorms and two male student dorms with a total occupancy of 1,500. Many students commute to campus by bus and the subway system.</p>

<h2>Faculty</h2>
<p>--&gt;</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>Sports play an important role in campus life. The downtown campus has tennis and basketball courts. The main campus has indoor and outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, a race track, a mini rock climbing wall, and a field that is used for both softball and soccer. Each year the university holds two major student athletic events.</p>
<p>Much of the sports facilities on the main campus are on land owned by the Taipei city government rather than by the university. The city government has considered in the past to reclaim the land to build an expressway, but has decided to back off with this project.</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>The university has 183 student clubs or societies.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Ultramarathon</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>24-hour International Ultramarathon</strong>: Runners from several countries, students, faculty, and celebrities such as <a>Ma Ying-jeou</a> participate in this annual event. Only very few of the contestants venture running for the entire duration of the twenty-four hour marathon. Portable toilets are set up near the race track with one or two toilets reserved for certain internationally renowned runners. Some spectators set up tents near the track and camp the entire night watching the marathon.</li>
  <li><strong>Campus Christmas Carol</strong>: Students from the music department visit the faculty residential apartment complexes to sing Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. Having people singing Christmas carols in the neighborhood is a rare sight in Taiwan since Christians make up a small minority of the Taiwanese population.</li>
