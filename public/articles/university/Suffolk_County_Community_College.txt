<p>Founded in 1959, Suffolk County Community College has three main campuses in Selden, Brentwood and Riverhead. It also has two &quot;satellite&quot; centers in Sayville and downtown Riverhead.</p>
<p>The school was founded largely through the efforts of Albert Ammerman (1914-November 26, 2008) who was the school's President from its founding December 1959 until 1983.  In its first year it had 13 faculty with 171 full time students at the <a>Sachem High School</a> in  Ronkonkoma and 335 part time students at <a>Riverhead High School</a> until what is now called the Ammerman campus opened in 1962 in the former Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium (originally built in 1912).  By 1977 it had opened a campus in Riverhead and one on the edge of the <a>Pilgrim Psychiatric Center</a> in Brentwood.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Ammerman</h3>
<p>The Ammerman campus at <a>Selden</a> opened in 1961. It is the largest, first, and main campus of Suffolk County Community College. Located off of <a>Nicolls Road</a> it has become a landmark of <a>Suffolk County</a>. The main campus is the home to the majority of the sports teams as well.  The site was previously a tuberculosis sanitarium.</p>
<p>Only two of the sanitorium's buildings remain (both of which were built by the <a>Works Progress Administration</a> in the 1930s -- Ammerman Building (the former William Hugh Ross Building for male patients) and Kreiling Hall (the former J.H. Marshall Building for children).  School officials deny a persistent rumor that the basement of the Kreiling Hall was used as a morgue noting that the walk in refrigerators there were used for a cafeteria.  As of 2008 only three of the 10,000 <a>Norway spruce</a> and <a>Scotch pine</a> trees that landscaped the sanitarium's grounds remain.</p>
