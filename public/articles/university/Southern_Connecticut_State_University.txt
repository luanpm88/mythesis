Two Southern Students also put their mark on the National Championship win. Shaun McGrath and Ronald Atwater of WSIN 1590 am, the campus radio station, traveled to Nebraska to cover all the games, and brought the game live back to listeners on the east coast via www.wsinradio.org and 1590am.  Audio clips from these two students were played nation wide on the web and TV. WSIN 1590am has all the home football and basketball games, live on the air and online. So tune into www.wsinradio.org for Owls Athletic events...</p>
<p><a>Abie Grossfeld</a>, former Olympian, is the former head gymnastics coach at Southern Connecticut State University, and helped the program become one of the best in the country.  He coached four Nissen Award winners (akin to football&#x2019;s Heisman Trophy), three NCAA Div. II championship teams, 10 Consecutive Eastern Collegiate Conference (EIGL) team championships (1975-&#x2019;84), and 148 gymnasts who achieved All American status.  Among those he coached were Peter Kormann, first U.S. Olympic individual gymnastics medalist since 1932; John Crosby, two World Cup individual gold medals; and three Pan American individual gold medal winners (1971 &amp; &#x2019;75).</p>
<p>The Swimming and Diving Team, a less publlicized team, has scored their highest at the NCAA championship meet in March for the years 2007 and 2008. This year they hope to score even higher and crack the top ten Div. II teams in the nation.</p>
