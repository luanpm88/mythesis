<p>&#x00c9;cole Centrale Paris is one of the <a>Centrale Graduate Schools</a> associated as the <a>Intergroupe des &#x00e9;coles centrales</a> network  with its sister institutions (<a>Lyon</a>, <a>Lille</a>, <a>Nantes</a>, <a>Marseille</a>, and <a>Beijing</a>). </p>
<p>It was the founder in 1988 of the TIME (<a>Top Industrial Managers for Europe</a>) network, which allows for student exchanges between leading European engineering schools. It also belongs to <a>CESAER</a>, an association of European engineering schools.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>&#x00c9;cole Centrale Paris is located in <a>Ch&#x00e2;tenay-Malabry</a>, <a>Hauts-de-Seine</a>, a southern suburb of <a>Paris</a>, <a>France</a> (in a region called <a>&#x00ce;le-de-France</a>), next to the Parc de <a>Sceaux</a> and its <a>Ch&#x00e2;teau de Sceaux</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole was founded in 1829 on a private initiative by <a>Alphonse Lavall&#x00e9;e</a>, who was its first president, and three associates: <a>Eug&#x00e8;ne Peclet</a>, <a>Jean-Baptiste Dumas</a>, and <a>Th&#x00e9;odore Olivier</a>. The founding vision was to educate multidisciplinary engineers for the emerging industrial sector. The institution was offered to the French <a>state</a> in 1857 by its creator, <a>Alphonse Lavall&#x00e9;e</a>.</p>
<p>Initially located in the H&#x00f4;tel de Juign&#x00e9; (now H&#x00f4;tel Sal&#x00e9; and home to the <a>Mus&#x00e9;e Picasso</a>), it was transferred to rue Montgolfier in 1884, where it stayed until 1969. Its current location neighbours the <a>Parc de Sceaux</a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Centralien</em> Programme</h2>
<p>The <em>centralien</em> Program is the original and main programme offered by the &#x00c9;cole. It is quite different from typical university or college studies; and specific to the French system of grandes &#x00e9;coles. Studies go beyond the undergraduate level and the engineering degree of &#x00c9;cole centrale Paris (<em>Ing&#x00e9;nieur centralien</em> or &#x201c;centralien engineer&#x201d;) is equivalent to a <a>Master of Science</a>. The curriculum is similar to those offered at other French <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>, such as <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole des Mines de Paris</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure d'&#x00c9;lectricit&#x00e9;</a> (<em>Sup&#x00e9;lec</em>), or <a>&#x00c9;cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss&#x00e9;es</a>.</p>
<p>According to the magazine L'Etudiant, the ECP is ranked 2nd in the top-list of French engineering schools, ahead of more than 200.</p>
<p>The class of 2008 is about 450 students.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>Most of the students are admitted after two to three years of <a>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a>, which correspond to two years of post high-school education with heavy emphasis on Math and Physics (<a>freshman</a> and <a>sophomore</a> years at US universities). At the end of the second year (&#x201c;Math&#x00e9;matiques sp&#x00e9;ciales&#x201d;) students can take a nation-wide competitive entrance examination for the <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>, including &#x00c9;cole centrale Paris. The ECP recruits among the top 6% of the students in <em>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</em>, who represent 4% of higher education students, which makes it a selective and prestigious institution.  A few students come from French top universities after completing three years of post high-school education. A significative contingent of students also comes from leading international universities which belong to the <a>TIME network</a> (Top Industrial Managers for Europe).</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Education at the ECP is multidisciplinary and typically lasts three to four years. During the first year (<em>Tronc Commun</em>, or &#x201c;Common Trunk&#x201d;), students are required to take classes in science (Mathematics, Physics, Biology); in engineering (Continuum Mechanics, Heat transfer, Digital image processing, Computer programming,&#x2026;) and in social sciences (Economics, Management, foreign languages,&#x2026;). After this year of &#x201c;Tronc commun&#x201d;, students choose all their course in a list respecting expectations from the administration. An excellent level in sciences is required. Then in the third year, students chose a major in a particular field which they study for one year and a half to two years. After completing these 3 years and a half to four years of education, they receive the degree of &#x201c;<em>Ing&#x00e9;nieur des arts et manufactures</em>&#x201d;, more commonly called &#x201c;ing&#x00e9;nieur <a>centralien</a>&#x201d;.</p>
<h2>National and international ties</h2>
<p>The &#x00c9;cole centrale Paris belongs to the French <a>intergroupe des &#x00e9;coles centrales</a>, together with <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lyon</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lille</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Nantes</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Marseille</a> and <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de P&#x00e9;kin</a> (<a>Beijing</a>).</p>
<p>Since 1837, the school has built important international ties with several <a>world-renowned universities.</a> </p>
<p>Students come from around the world to study for several years on the school campus. &#x00c9;cole Centrale students may also obtain a &#x201c;double degree&#x201d; at one of the partner schools, depending on the school, field of study, and degree type.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the &#x00c9;cole is one of the founding members of the <a>TIME</a> (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The ECP hosts eight laboratories:</p>

  <li><a>Solids Structure and Properties</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The graduate school</h2>
<p>In addition to the <em>centralien</em> training, the <em>&#x00c9;cole centrale Paris</em> offers a broad range of master's programs in science and engineering (1 year- or 2 year-programs). These programmes are open to applicants having completed their undergraduate studies at other institutions.</p>
<p>The ECP also has a <a>Ph.D.</a> programme for students with a master's level.  More than 200 doctoral candidates work in one of the 8 laboratories of the school.</p>
