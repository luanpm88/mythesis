<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Tanimoto English School, the forerunner of Kansai Gaidai University, was established in 1945.  The original Katahoko campus was founded in 1966 as an University of Foreign Studies.  Today, the Katahoko campus has been converted into a public park and a municipal library.  The Hotani Campus was established in 1984 and currently houses the Department of International Communication and a <a>Confucius Institute</a>. The Nakamiya campus opened in April 2002, and now operates as the main campus of the university.</p>
<h2>Asian Studies Program</h2>
<p>The Asian Studies Program is located in the Center for International Education at the Nakamiya Campus. Students from all over the world and with various majors participate in this program which is one of the largest in the area. An integral part of the program is the Speaking Partners Program which pairs incoming foreign exchange students with a local Kansai Gaidai student who helps with the adjustment of living in Japan. &lt;br /&gt; Another part of the exchange program is the home stay program which places a limited number of students with local families to provide an immersive Japanese cultural and societal experience. For those students who were unable to get a spot in the home stay program, the school offers a home visit program which pairs a foreign exchange student with a family so that the student may visit them and participate in families activities usually weekly or as determined by the student and the family.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>Accommodation for foreign exchange students are located in the Seminar Houses. Numbered 1 through 4, each house is located around the Katahoko Library and a 20-minute walk away from the Nakamiya Campus. Seminar Houses 1, 2 and 4 are dormitory style with usually two students to a room with entire dormitory shared facilities. While Seminar House 3 is an apartment style dormitory with students sharing common living quarters and kitchens while sleeping in 4 separate rooms. Seminar House 4 is the newest and largest of the Seminar Houses and is wheelchair accessible. &lt;br /&gt; There is a strict zero tolerance policy against alcohol consumption in Seminar Houses, although during fall 2008 semester, Seminar House 4 was the location of a pilot project for reasonable and controlled consumption of alcohol within the Seminar House. Results of the pilot project have not been announced nor published although this project did not continue to the spring 2009 semester.</p>
