There are a number of walking trails that double as cross-country ski trails during winter, as well as a few trails located at the local ski resort <a>Eaglecrest Ski Area</a>.  There are many opportunities for camping near UAS, both tent and cabin.  Fishing is abundant at all three campuses.With mountains, glaciers, the forest and the ocean for their playground, UAS students pursue interests as varied as mountain climbing, hiking, kayaking, mountain biking, scuba diving, salmon and halibut fishing, camping, skiing, snowboarding and more within minutes of campus.  .Southeast Alaska abounds with unique outdoor recreational choices, and once you're able to decide what to do, activities take place against a spectacular background of mountains, glaciers, and the Inside Passage . Fishing is world class, especially from early spring through late fall..Divers explore beneath the Southeast waters while sailors and wind surfers look for winds above. The protected waters and fjords of the Inside Passage make Southeast Alaska a kayaking paradise. Many kayakers will transport their boats on the state ferry system and paddle between ports. Each SE Alaska community maintains trail systems leading to alpine ridges and seashore beaches. Some summer trails double as winter cross country ski routes. Eaglecrest, Juneau's ski area, has produced at least one Olympic and World Cup alpine skiing champion plus plenty of others who dream of gold.The Forest Service and the State of Alaska maintain a series of alpine, lakeside, and beach public rental cabins. Many others pack their own tents and camp wherever the fancy strikes them.</p>
