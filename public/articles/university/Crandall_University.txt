<p>  <strong>Crandall University</strong> is a small <a>Liberal Arts</a> university located in <a>Moncton, New Brunswick</a>, <a>Canada</a>.  Crandall is operated by the <a>Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded in 1949 under the name <strong>United Baptist Bible Training School</strong> (UBBTS), and served as both a <a>secondary school</a> and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to <strong>Atlantic Baptist College</strong> (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees in the early 1980s.  Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of <a>Moncton</a>'s central business district.</p>
<p>The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to <strong>Atlantic Baptist University</strong>, a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. ABU sports teams play under the name <em>Blue Tide</em>. The institution was the first, and thus far only, <a>English</a> university in Moncton.  The Atlantic Baptist University Act was passed by the <a>New Brunswick</a> Legislature in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm</a> Atlantic Baptist University Act&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2009, plans for a $24 million expansion to the campus, including a new academic building, a second residence and a sports complex were unveiled. Construction is currently underway. The expansion will allow the student enrollment to increase to 1200.</p>
<p>On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to <strong>Crandall University</strong> in honour of Rev. <a>Joseph Crandall</a>, a pioneering Baptist minister in New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html</a> Atlantic Baptist University changes name&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
