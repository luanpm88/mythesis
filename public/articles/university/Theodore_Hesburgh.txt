<p>Hesburgh grew up in Syracuse and had wished to become a priest since early childhood. He studied at Notre Dame until his seminary sent him to <a>Italy</a>. He studied in Rome until he was forced to leave due to the outbreak of <a>World War II</a>. He graduated from <a>The Catholic University of America</a> in 1945, having earned a Doctorate in Sacred Theology. He became executive vice-president in 1949 and served in that position for 3 years.</p>
<h2>President</h2>
<p>He served as Notre Dame's President for 35 years (1952&#x2013;87), the longest tenure so far.  He supervised dramatic growth, as well as a transition to coeducation in 1972. During his term, the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6 million, the endowment rose by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million, and research funding rose by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.</p>

He was awarded the <a>Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 1964, the <a>Congressional Gold Medal</a> on December 9, 1999 and the <a>United States Military Academy's</a> <a>Sylvanus Thayer Award</a> in 1980.</p>
<p>In 1967, he led an academic movement which issued the so-called Land O'Lakes statement which insisted upon &quot;true autonomy and academic freedom in the face of authority of whatever kind, lay or clerical&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1982 he was awarded the <a>F. Sadlier Dinger Award</a> by educational publisher <a>William H. Sadlier, Inc.</a> in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the ministry of religious education in America.  He was the first recipient of the <a>NCAA Gerald R. Ford Award</a> in 2004.</p>
<p>Hesburgh served as a member of the United States <a>Civil Rights Commission</a> from 1957, and Chairman from 1969, until his dismissal by President <a>Richard Nixon</a> in 1972 due to his frequent opposition to Nixon policies.  He also served in a number of other posts on government commissions, non-profit organization boards, and Vatican missions, beginning with his appointment to a science commission by President <a>Dwight Eisenhower</a> in 1954.</p>
<p>According to <a>Rick Perlstein</a> in <em>Nixonland</em>, Hesburgh was considered by <a>George McGovern</a> as his running mate in the <a>1972 presidential election</a>. McGovern chose <a>Thomas Eagleton</a>.</p>
<p>President <a>Jimmy Carter</a> appointed him to a blue-ribbon immigration reform commission in 1979; the commission's finding &mdash; that any national immigration reform proposals can succeed only if the American national border is properly secured beforehand &mdash; has been cited by various opponents of <a>illegal immigration to the United States</a>, especially those that are Catholic or sympathetic to Catholic views.</p>
<p>He was one of the founders of <a>People for the American Way</a>. Hesburgh served on the <a>Knight Commission</a> that overhauled college sports from 1990 to 1996. Hesburgh was a major figure in US politics and the <a>Catholic Church</a> from the 1950s to the 1990s, and he is still influential today. He is an endorser of the <a>Genocide Intervention Network</a> and is a strong supporter of interfaith dialogue.</p>
<p>In 2009, he supported the invitation for <a>Barack Obama</a> to speak at Notre Dame, which was controversial because of Obama's strong endorsement of pro-choice legislation.</p>
