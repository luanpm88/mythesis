<p><strong>Lamar University</strong>, often referred to as <strong>LU</strong>, is a comprehensive <a>coeducational</a> <a>public</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Beaumont</a>, <a>Texas</a>. The University offers <a>bachelors</a>, <a>masters</a> and <a>doctoral</a> degrees. Lamar has been a member of The <a>Texas State University System</a> since 1995 and was previously the largest member of the now defunct <strong>Lamar University System</strong>. As of fall of 2010, the university had 14,388 students, the highest enrollment in the university&#x2019;s 87-year history.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as <strong>South Park Junior College</strong>, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School (formerly South Park Middle School, the building was demolished April 2010). South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive <a>Texas Department of Education</a> approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925.</p>
<p>In about 1932, recognizing that the junior college was now serving the region, the college renamed itself <strong>Lamar College</strong>, after <a>Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>. The next year, the separation of the college from South Park High School began with construction of new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.</p>
<p>With the end of <a>World War II</a>, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment, and the Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led by Texas Representative <a>Jack Brooks</a> failed, but the following year the bill passed both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor <a>Beauford Jester</a> signed the bill creating <strong>Lamar State College of Technology</strong> with the new entity to focus on engineering and science, an emphasis that continues today.</p>
<p>Enrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960, when master's degrees were offered in several fields. The enrollment plateaued 1970s as the <a>baby boomers</a> generation reached adulthood. In 1969, Lamar State College opened its first branch in <a>Orange, Texas</a>. In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering, and in 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University.</p>
<p>In 1975, the university merged with Port Arthur College in <a>Port Arthur, Texas</a>, creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator <a>Carl Parker</a> sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System, and in 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. Lamar Institute of Technology was created in 1990 to provide technical, business, health and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the <a>Texas State University System</a>, with the <a>Lamar State College - Orange</a>, <a>Lamar State College - Port Arthur</a> and <a>Lamar Institute of Technology</a> campuses becoming separate entities within the system. In the fall of 1998 the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Since the reorganization, Lamar University's enrollment has continually increased; Enrollment reached 14,000 students in 2009. Recently numerous construction projects have revitalized or replaced old buildings.</p>
<p>Lamar was one of 10 colleges nationwide named to the Great Colleges to Work For Honor Roll by the <a>Chronicle of Higher Education</a> in 2009. In July 2010 Lamar was chosen to join the Gulf Project, a coalition of <a>scientists</a>, policy <a>experts</a> and <a>researchers</a> working to protect Texas&#x2019; <a>economy</a> and <a>environment</a> in the event of a disaster such as the <a>Deepwater Horizon explosion</a> in the <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The Lamar University campus is located on Martin Luther King Boulevard, near <a>U.S. Highway 69</a>, in the southeast part of <a>Beaumont, Texas</a>.

<p></p>
<h3>Campus History</h3>
<p>In the late 1990s, Lamar began undertaking campus improvement projects. Most buildings on the campus dated to the late 1960s and 70s and had deteriorated since. Many older buildings in the northern part of the campus were gutted and refinished one-by-one.</p>
<p>In 2001, the University began replacing its 1960s-vintage residence halls with new <a>apartment</a>-style housing facilities, dubbed &quot;Cardinal Village&quot; (the <a>cardinal</a> is the schools nickname). Older campus housing facilities have been demolished as the Cardinal Village complex has expanded to meet demand. Demand for on-campus housing has risen, coinciding with the opening of the new residence halls. Cardinal Village II, III &amp; IV were built specifically to meet these demands. , a new gourmet food court style dining hall was opened to provide students with a wider selection of dining opportunities.</p>
<p>In March 2005, the McDonald Gym temporarily closed. The gym underwent extensive renovation and adjacent to it a new recreational sports center was built. The $19 million center, named the Sheila Umphrey Recreational Sports Center, opened in April 2007. The  facility includes  of cardiovascular and free-weight training; a one-tenth-mile indoor walking/jogging track; a  climbing wall; basketball, volleyball and badminton courts; racquetball, handball and squash courts; a wellness and fitness center; health food caf&#x00e9; and juice bar; lounge areas with pool tables; an outdoor putting green; and air hockey, foosball, video games and TV.</p>
<p>&lt;center&gt; &lt;gallery&gt; Image:montagne.jpg|<a>Montagne Center</a>, home of Cardinals Basketball &lt;/gallery&gt; &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p>In August 2007, the University completed construction on Cardinal Village IV, a $16-million expansion of its state-of-the-art residence halls. The University began construction of a new phase of the residence halls, Cardinal Village Phase V in December 2009. Construction is estimated to be completed in late 2010 and will bring on-campus housing capacity to 2,500 students.</p>
<p>The University, in anticipation of the return of football program in 2010, started work on <a>Provost Umphrey Stadium</a> (formerly Cardinal Stadium) and a new Athletics Complex in the Spring of 2009.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>Lamar Cardinals</strong> (variously <strong>Cardinals</strong> or <strong>Cards</strong>) refers to the <a>collegiate</a> <a>athletic</a> <a>teams</a> of Lamar University. The inception of the nickname &quot;Cardinals&quot; dates back to the schools name change to Lamar in 1932. The teams compete in <a>Division I</a> of <a>NCAA</a> <a>sports</a>. The school has participated in practically every level of collegiate athletics from its inception as a <a>junior college</a> in 1923 to its realization as a <a>university</a> in 1971. Lamar sponsors fourteen teams (seven men's teams, seven women's teams) that compete in the NCAA's <a>Southland Conference</a>. The newest team is the reinstated <a>football</a> team with women's <a>softball</a> expected to be on the way.</p>
<p>The Cardinals participate in men and women's <a>basketball</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>track &amp; field</a>, <a>cross-country</a>, <a>tennis</a>, women's <a>soccer</a> and <a>volleyball</a>, and men's <a>baseball</a> and <a>football</a>.</p>
<p>The Football program's signature win came on September 5, 1981, in an 18-17 win over the UPI #20 ranked Baylor Bears under Head Coach <a>Larry Kennan</a>. This would be the first time that a Division 1-AA team defeated a Division 1-A ranked opponent. The football program was dropped in 1989, largely due to budget overruns and declining attendance.</p>
<p>The proposed re-introduction of the football team would be funded by an increase in student tuition fees.  Under the current plan, the football team would not arrive until 2010.  On January 30, 2008, 78% of Lamar students voted to approve the athletics fee required for football's resurrection.  Under the current plan, the university would not play conference games until 2011, although it may play a full schedule of exhibition games in 2010. Regents of The Texas State University System approved the athletics fee to reinstate football at its regular meeting February 20. On May 19, 2008, <a>Ray Woodard</a> was chosen as head coach for the football program. Thanks to a major gift from an anonymous donor, the field that will soon again see NCAA football action will bear the name W.S. &#x201c;Bud&#x201d; Leonard Field, named for a former player and longtime Lamar advocate.</p>
<p>The Lamar University Cardinals Men's football team returned to the gridiron, after a 21 year hiatus, on September 4, 2010.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Lamar offers 63 undergraduate, 47 master's and nine doctoral degree programs in five academic colleges, these include the <a>College of Engineering</a>, <a>College of Education and Human Development</a>, <a>College of Business</a>, <a>College of Fine Arts and Communications</a> and the <a>College of Arts and Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>The university also has many academic units that fall outside of the five main colleges. The College of Graduate Studies handles graduate students. The Center for Teaching and Learning Enhancement offers training and support to <a>faculty</a> and runs the universities Active and Collaborative Engagement for Students (ACES) Program.

<p>In August 2010 the <a>American Council of Trustees and Alumni</a> (ACTA) released a study on core curriculum standards for 715 4-year institutions. The study compared colleges on their commitment to core subjects deemed essential to a well-rounded, competitive education. Lamar was one of only 16 institutions to receive an A rating. The study was featured in the <a>Washington Post</a> with a tag line &quot;Forget Harvard and think Lamar.&quot; In October 2010 the University announced that they would raise admission standards for the second time in 2 years because of the increased enrollment. The enrollment standards increase will take affect in the fall of 2011.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering</h3>
<p> The <a>College of Engineering</a> is arguably the schools most respected program. Lamar's birth was in large part due to the demand for technically trained individuals in the area, after the 1901 <a>Spindletop</a> oil discovery, making <a>Beaumont, Texas</a> one of the most heavily <a>industrialized</a> areas of the <a>United States</a>. The School was founded in 1923 as a <a>junior college</a>. On September 1, 1951 the Texas Legislature promoted the school to a 4 year institution and renamed the school <strong>Lamar State College of Technology</strong>. The legislature specifically noted the school would  emphasize engineering, <a>technology</a>, and <a>science</a> to serve the regions large industrial base. The school immediately began granting engineering degrees in 1951. In 1970, Lamar's history as a science and technology school was again a driving force in a name change. The state authorized Lamar to offer its first doctoral degree program, the doctor of engineering. A dream shared by many became a reality on May 3, 1971, when Gov. <a>Preston Smith</a> signed a bill changing the name of <em>Lamar State College of Technology</em> to <strong>Lamar University</strong>. In 2005, Lamar's First Ph.D program was established in the College of Engineering: the Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p>The College of Engineering has 10 research centers located under its authority. These are coordinated under the Texas Centers for Technology Incubation (TCTI).</p>
<p>The Dan F. Smith Department of <a>Chemical Engineering</a> was established with a $5 million donation from Dan F. Smith in 2009. Lamar University Chemical Engineering has the proud history of being one of the top rated programs in the country. The program continually produces the same or more M.S. in Chemical Engineering graduates than Universities such as <a>Stanford</a>, <a>IIT</a> and <a>MIT</a>. The new building housing the Ph.D. program will be completed in mid 2010.</p>
<p>The <a>Civil Engineering</a> department is one of the broadest departments in the College. Headed by Dr. Robert L. Yuan.  It offers eight degrees. In the Fall of 2008 the Civil Engineering department started a new program, the Reese Construction Management program, with a 1.25 million dollar donation from Jerry and Sheila Reese. The program is headed by Steve McCrary Ph.D.</p>
<p>The Philip M. Drayer Department of <a>Electrical Engineering</a> was endowed with a 5 million dollar gift from Philip M. Drayer in 2007. The department has been chaired by Harley Myler, Ph.D., since 2001. Dr. Myler is the inaugural holder of the Mitchle Endowed chair in Telecommunications. The department has many successful alumni in the industry including Phil Drayer (LUEE &#x2019;67), and <a>Charles Garrett</a> (LUEE &#x2019;59) inventor and founder of Garrett Metal Detectors.</p>
<h3>College of Business</h3>
<p>The University established the <strong>College of Business</strong> in 1972. Prior to this time, degrees in business and economics were granted by the Division of Business, which was established in 1951, and the School of Business, established in 1954.
