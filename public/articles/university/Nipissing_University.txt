<p><strong>Nipissing University</strong> is a public liberal arts university located in <a>North Bay, Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>, on a 720 acre (2.9&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)  site overlooking <a>Lake Nipissing</a>. The university's unique character is defined by its location in <a>Northern Ontario</a>, and a large and highly respected faculty of education.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nipissing University College was established in 1967 as an affiliate of <a>Laurentian University</a> in <a>Sudbury</a>,</p>
<p>The university's roots go back as early as 1909, when the <strong>North Bay Normal School</strong>, a teacher training school, was established in the city. The school was renamed <strong>North Bay Teachers' College</strong> in 1953, and became Nipissing University College's faculty of education in 1967. After the university received a prestigious award in 2010, the Faculty of Education was re-named the Schulich School of Education. Nipissing University was honoured with the Schulich designation as this distinguishes the faculty of education for its superior teacher education program and reputation for excellence in education. The Schulich School of Education at Nipissing University joins the Schulich School of Business at York University, the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Western Ontario, the Schulich School of Music at McGill University, the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University and the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary.   In 2009, Nipissing University celebrated 100 Years of Teacher Education in Ontario. The university is proud of its roots and is regarded as one of Canada's foremost faculties of education with a strong emphasis of technology in the classroom.  Nipissing University is one of the largest providers for Additional Qualification courses for Teachers. The University offers courses online, on- site, and partially online. Every year the University receives around 5,000 registrations from Teachers across the Province that register for AQ, ABQ, Honour Specialist and Principals Qualification courses. Nipissing University is the only university in Ontario to offer the Advanced Bachelor of Education Degree. Since 1909 over 17,000 teachers have achieved their Teaching credentials from Nipissing University.  The governance of Nipissing University  was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. Nipissing University has a joint BEd program with Wilfrid Laurier University for the Concurrent program. </p>
<p>The university is also widely known for its portrayal in <a>Lynn Johnston</a>'s comic strip <em><a>For Better or For Worse</a></em>, in which <a>Elizabeth Patterson</a> was a student in the education program. Johnston lives near North Bay in real life, although the Patterson family was depicted as living in a fictional community in Southern Ontario.</p>
<h2>Academic organization</h2>
<p>The university comprises three faculties: the Schulich School of Education, the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science and the Faculty of Applied and Professional Studies.  Currently there are three full time graduate programs: the Master of Education, a Master of Arts in History and a Masters of Science in Mathematics. The Schulich School of Education features the iTeach Laptop Learning Program, which was established in 2001. The iTeach Program, which is the first teacher preparation program in North America to utilize a dual Operating System laptop (Mac OS X &amp; Windows), facilitates equipping the pre-service teacher candidates with an expanded skill-set in the area of educational technology. Teacher-candidates explore the process of integrating digital resources &amp; technology into their practice teaching experiences throughout the school year. The end result is a set of graduating teachers ready to enter the 21st Century classroom --- prepared to supplement and enhance their teaching using various forms of educational technology (e.g., SMART Boards, Personal Response Systems, Podcasting, digital presentations using Mac OS X Keynote &amp; Microsoft PowerPoint, iPod Touch units, Wii-Mote Interactive Whiteboard systems, etc.)</p>
<h2>Aboriginal programs</h2>
<p>Nipissing University developed governing board and senate policies as well as Aboriginal governed councils within the university structure. The Nipissing University&#x2019;s Aboriginal Teacher Certification Program and Native Special Education Assistant Diploma Program were developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet specific needs within Aboriginal communities. The Nipissing University First Generation Strategy Pilot Project, a three-credit university success course for first generation students, begins first-year Aboriginal students to campus before the start of the school year.</p>
