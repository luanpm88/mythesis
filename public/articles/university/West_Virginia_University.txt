<h3>Founding the University</h3>
<p>Under the terms of the 1862 <a>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a>, the West Virginia Legislature created the  <strong>Agricultural College of West Virginia</strong> on February 7, 1867, and the school officially opened on September 2 of the same year. On December 4, 1868, lawmakers re-named the college West Virginia  University to represent a broader range of higher education. The University was built on the grounds of three former academies, the  Monongalia Academy of 1814, the Morgantown Female Academy of 1831, and Woodburn Female Seminary of 1858. Upon its founding, the local newspaper claimed that &quot;a place more eligible for the quiet and successful pursuit of science and literature is nowhere to be found.&quot; After the Woodburn Seminary building was destroyed by fire in 1873, the centerpiece of what is now Woodburn Hall was completed in 1876, under the name New Hall. The name was changed to University Building in 1878, when the College of Law was founded as the first professional school in the state of West Virginia. The precursor to Woodburn Circle was finished in 1893 when Chitwood Hall (then Science Hall) was constructed on the bluff's  north side. At the turn of the 20th century, a north wing was added to University Building, and the facility was renamed Woodburn Hall. Throughout the next decade, Woodburn Hall underwent several renovations and additions, including the construction of the south wing and east tower housing the iconic <a>Seth Thomas</a> clock.</p>
<p>WVU was required to have a Cadet Corps under the terms of the Morrill Act of 1862. The <a>United States War Department</a>  offered military equipment to the University at no charge, forming the basis of the school's Military Tactics department. The heavy military influence led to opposition of female enrollment that lasted through the first decade of the University. The trend changed in 1889, when ten women were allowed to enroll and seek degrees at the University. In June 1891, Harriet Lyon became the  first woman to receive a degree from West Virginia University, finishing first in the class ahead of all male students. <a>thumb|350px|right|West Virginia University's first football team, formed in 1891.</a>  During the University's early years, daily chapel services and roll call for all students were mandatory, limiting time for student recreation. Following the removal of these obligations, students became active in extracurricular   activities and established many of the school's first athletic and student organizations. The first edition of the student newspaper known as the <em>Athenaeum</em>,  now <em>The Daily Athenaeum</em>, was published in 1887, and the West Virginia Law Review became the fourth oldest law review in the United States when it was founded in 1894. Kappa Delta, the first sorority at WVU, was established in 1899.</p>
<h3>Early 20th century</h3>
<p>[[File:Boyd Arnold Mascot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Boyd &quot;Slim&quot; Arnold, the first Mountaineer mascot to don the traditional buckskin uniform. His selection in 1937 marked  the beginning of an official process to name the mascot annually.]] The University's outlook at the turn of the century was optimistic, as the school constructed the first library in present-day Stewart Hall during 1902 and later welcomed <a>U.S. President William Taft</a> to campus for WVU President Thomas Hodges's inauguration in 1911. Women's involvement in the war efforts at home led to the creation of Women's Hall dormitory, now Stalnaker Hall, in 1918. </p>
<p>Despite the wartime struggles, the  University was able to establish the disciplines of <a>biology</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>journalism</a>, <a>pharmacy</a>, and the first <a>mining</a> program in the nation. In 1918 Oglebay Hall  was built to house the expanded <a>agriculture</a> and <a>forestry</a> programs.  The Mountaineer mascot was adopted during the late 1920s, with an unofficial process to select the Mountaineer through 1936. An official selection process began  naming the mascot annually in 1937, with Boyd &quot;Slim&quot; Arnold becoming the first Mountaineer to wear the <a>buckskin</a> uniform. </p>
<p>As male students left for <a>WWII</a> in 1939, women became more prominent in the University and surpassed the number of males on campus for the first time in 1943. As enrollment approached 14,000 in the 1960s, the University continued expansion plans by building the Evansdale Residential Complex to house approximately 1,800 students, the Mountainlair student union, and several engineering and creative arts facilities on the Evansdale campus. In 1970 the <a>WVU Coliseum</a>, a new basketball facility with a capacity of 14,000, opened near the new campus.</p>
<h3>A new era</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Woodburn Hall is one of the oldest buildings at West Virginia University and has long since been a symbol of the university.</a> The student population continued to grow in the late seventies, reaching 22,000. With no room for growth on  the downtown campus, the <a>football stadium</a> was closed, and the new <a>Mountaineer Field</a> was opened near the Medical campus on September 6, 1980. they also garnered national attention as solutions for reducing alcohol consumption and partying on college campuses across the country.  In 2001 a 34 million-dollar,  recreation facility opened on the Evansdale campus, providing students with exercise facilities, recreational activities, and personal training programs. </p>
<p>WVU reached a new level of athletic success during the first decade of the new millennium. The football team featured a 2-0 <a>BCS bowl</a> record, six consecutive bowl game appearances,  a #1 ranking in the <a>USA Today Coaches Poll</a>, three consecutive 11-win seasons amassing a 33-5 record, 41 consecutive weeks in the top 25, and 4 conference championships. The men's basketball team won the <a>2007 NIT Championship</a> and the <a>2010 Big East championship</a>, while appearing four times in the sweet sixteen, twice in the elite-eight, and once in the final-four of the <a>NCAA tournament</a>. The athletic successes brought the University a new level of national exposure, and enrollment has since increased to nearly 30,000 students.</p>
<p>On April 24, 2008, the <em><a>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a></em> reported that the university had improperly granted an <a>MBA</a> degree to <a>Heather Bresch</a>, the daughter of the state's governor <a>Joe Manchin</a> and an employee of <a>Mylan</a>, a pharmaceutical company whose then-chairman Milan Puskar was one of the University's largest donors. In the resulting aftermath, the University determined that Bresch's degree had been awarded without having the prerequisite requirements met and rescinded it, leading  to the resignation of president <a>Michael Garrison</a>, provost Gerald Lang, and business school dean Steve Sears. Garrison had been profiled as a trend toward non-traditional university presidents by The Chronicle of Higher Education, and Inside Higher Ed, but the Faculty Senate approved a vote of no confidence in the search that selected him. C. Peter McGrath was named interim president in August 2008.  James P. Clements became WVU's 23rd president on June 30, 2009. He previously served as provost at Towson University.  On September 16, 2009 <a>Michele G. Wheatly</a> was named Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>WVU is designated as a Research University (High Research Activity) by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Funding from external sources for total sponsored programs is $152 million. WVU is also a leader in biometric technology research and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead academic partner in biometrics research. According to a survey by the <a>Wall Street Journal</a>, employers ranked West Virgina University in the top 45 and WVU's Engineering program 23rd nationally for producing graduates best qualified to enter the workforce.</p>

A separate Criminology &amp; Investigative Sciences major was later added.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Health Sciences Campus</a> <strong>Biometrics</strong> is an engineering-centric field of study offered at WVU, the first institution in the world to establish a <a>bachelor of science</a> degree in <a>Biometric Systems</a>. In 2003 the University also founded the initial chapter of the Student Society for the Advancement of Biometrics (SSAB). The program, located in the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE), provides a firm understanding of the underlying <a>electrical engineering</a> and <a>computer engineering</a> disciplines that support <a>biometric</a> applications. On February 6, 2008, WVU became the national academic leader for the <a>FBI</a>'s biometric research. WVU is also the founding site for the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), focusing on biometrics and <a>identification technology</a>. The university maintains and develops collaborative relationships with other academic institutions to meet research needs.</p>
<p><strong>The Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center</strong> is located on West Virginia University&#x2019;s Evansdale Campus and houses the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy.  These schools grant doctoral and professional degrees in 16 different fields, as well as a variety of other <a>Master's</a> and <a>Bachelor's</a> degrees. For 2009, <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> ranked WVU&#x2019;s Medical School ninth overall in the nation for rural medicine.</p>
<p>Also located on the Health Sciences Campus is WVU's local teaching hospital, Ruby Memorial Hospital, which is one of only two designated Trauma I hospitals in the state and has also been designated a magnet hospital for its ability to attract and retain high quality nursing staff.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:MountainlairWVU2008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Mountainlair]] Student Union is a popular place for students on campus.]] The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown. This part of campus includes eight academic buildings on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. The Downtown Campus comprises several architectural styles predominantly featuring red brick including Victorian Second Empire, Federal, Neoclassical, and Collegiate Gothic among others. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north-northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the <a>Monongahela River</a>, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion was limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the WVU Health Sciences Center, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>The Health Sciences Campus is located near <a>Mountaineer Field</a>, over a ridge from the Evansdale Campus.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|left|200px|The PRT shuttles students to and from WVU's Health Sciences, Evansdale, and Downtown Campuses.</a> <strong>The Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)</strong> system was built to link WVU's distributed campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences) and to reduce student traffic on local highways. <a>Boeing</a> began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in 1972. The unique aspect that makes the system &quot;personal&quot; is that a rider specifies their destination when entering the system and, depending on system load, the PRT can dispatch a car that will travel directly to that station.</p>
<p>WVU students, faculty and staff ride by paying a per-semester fee; they swipe their magnetically-encoded ID cards through the turnstiles when entering the stations. Others pay a cash fare of $0.50. The PRT began operation in 1973, with U.S. President <a>Richard Nixon</a>'s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005) and uses approximately 70 cars.</p>
<p>The system has  of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. <a>Steam</a> heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.</p>
<p>The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige <a>fiberglass</a> and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room.</p>
<p>The <a>National Society of Professional Engineers</a> named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,</p>
<p>Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the <a>Mountainlair</a> <a>student union</a> where groups of students participate in the &quot;PRT Cram&quot; with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Busses and shuttles</strong> operated by the University can be utilized (during limited hours) in addition to the community's Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free.</p>
<p>The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Wise Library on the downtown campus is West Virginia University's main library.</a> The University maintains four libraries on its campuses. These include the <a>Downtown Campus Library</a>, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, and the Law Library. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Digital Collections, Government Documents, Map Collection, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations. West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and computers with high speed Internet access.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a>West Virginia and Regional History Collection</a>, the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. According to the university, the collection includes over 4,500,000 <a>manuscript</a> documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 <a>newspapers</a>, 100,000 <a>photographs</a> and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 <a>microfilm</a>s, <a>oral histories</a>, films and <a>folk music</a> recordings. It is often called simply the &quot;West Virginia Collection.&quot; </p>
<p>In 2007, the Princeton Review ranked West Virginia University libraries 5th best of 366 college libraries surveyed.</p>
<p>The university co-publishes, with the <a>United Association for Labor Education</a>, <em><a>Labor Studies Journal</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Campus Safety</h3>
<p>WVU's campus has been ranked one of the safest in the country by <a>Reader's Digest</a>. The study was largely based on the safety of dorm facilities, emergency preparedness, and security staff. The University  created WVU Alert, a text-based alert system for quickly disseminating emergency situations to faculty and students. There are 37 blue-lit towers housing emergency phones across the WVU campuses.</p>
<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p><strong>FallFest</strong> welcomes students to the University by providing an evening of entertainment and musical performances after the first day of classes at the <a>Mountainlair Student Union</a>. The event was established in 1995 to provide a safe alternative to partying and has since become one of the largest University-sponsored events,  typically drawing crowds of 15,000 or more. The celebration has been  highlighted by a series of evening concerts performed by renowned artists on the Mountainlair green, including <a>Akon</a>, <a>The Black Eyed Peas</a>, <a>Common</a>, <a>Cypress Hill</a>, <a>Dashboard Confessional</a>, <a>Daughtry</a>, <a>Fuel</a>, <a>John Legend</a>,  <a>Kanye West</a>, <a>Kris Allen</a>, <a>Ludacris</a>, <a>Maroon 5</a>, <a>Mos Def</a>, <a>O.A.R.</a>, <a>The Roots</a>,  <a>Staind</a>, <a>Third Eye Blind</a>, <a>Wyclef Jean</a>,  and <a>3 Doors Down</a>. A dance party, film festival, comedy show, and several indoor musical performances  are traditionally featured as well. </p>
<p><strong>Mountaineer Week</strong> is a celebration of WVU tradition and [[Appalachia| Appalachian  heritage]] that began in 1947. Festivities have expanded over the years to include competitions among WVU students, designed to honor school and state pride.  A beard growing competition was introduced in 1949 that has continued throughout the event's history. Participants must shave before the panel of judges that also chooses the winner at  the end of the competition. The Mr. and Ms. Mountaineer competition has been included in Mountaineer Week since 1962, honoring one male and one female student who show outstanding school spirit, academic excellence, and extracurricular involvement. The annual PRT Cram features the unique <a>PRT system</a>, where students compete to fit the maximum number of riders on a special-model PRT car with the windows removed.  The record was set in 2000, when 97 students fit inside one PRT car. </p>
<p><strong>Fall Family Weekend</strong> is an opportunity for students' family members to experience WVU campus life by attending  classes, athletic events, college presentations, and student events such as WVU &quot;Up All Night&quot;. Tours of the campus facilities are offered by individual colleges and organizations,  including tours of the PRT.</p>
<p><strong>Homecoming</strong> at West Virginia involves a home football game and a weekend of pageantry. Activities include  the Alumni Band-led homecoming parade through downtown Morgantown, crowning of the  royalty, the football game, and a performance by the WVU Alumni band  during the pre-game show. Student organizations participate in the parade by  designing floats, and various receptions are held by colleges, student groups, and the alumni center throughout the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Greek Week</strong> is held during the spring semester, providing a venue for competition between  Greek organizations. Highlights include airband events, where organizations compete in <a>cheerleading</a> and dance routines, and sports competitions on the Mountainlair recreational field. The competitions strive to highlight WVU's student spirit and present a positive image  of the fraternities and sororities. The student union offers many recreational opportunities to students including a <a>movie theater</a>,   <a>bowling alley</a>, <a>pool hall</a>, <a>ballroom</a>s, <a>video game arcade</a>, a cafeteria style restaurant, and a collection of fast food restaurants. </p>
<p><strong><a>WVU &quot;Up All Night&quot;</a></strong> is a program designed to provide a safe environment for WVU students to socialize during weekends. The Mountainlair has hosted &quot;Up All Night&quot; every Thursday through Saturday during the fall and spring semesters since 1998. The facility offers a six-lane swimming pool, 20-seat Jacuzzi,  of cardio and free-weight equipment, an elevated running track, basketball courts, volleyball and badminton courts, glass squash and racquetball courts, and a  climbing wall.  The center also offers a variety of wellness programs, personal training, child care services, exercise classes, and intramural activities. </p>
<p><strong>The Mountaineer Adventure Program (MAP)</strong> offers several activities including Adventure WV, Challenge Course,  and International Trips. Adventure WV is focused on providing guidance to freshmen and sophomores through various outdoor orientation expeditions.  The Challenge Course program utilizes a recreational facility designed  to teach teamwork and problem solving skills through physical interaction.  International Trips offers world-wide recreational opportunities to places like <a>Fiji</a> and <a>Peru</a>, as well as study abroad credit courses.  Several  of the MAP programs provide University-accepted credit hours. [[File:Coopers Rock State Forest.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nearby [[Coopers Rock State Forest]]]] <strong>The Outdoor Recreation Center</strong> is a division of the Student Recreation Center, and facilitates students in finding recreational activities locally  and in other areas of West Virginia. Some trips are sponsored by the center including whitewater rafting on the <a>Cheat River</a> and hiking in the <a>Monongahela National Forest</a>. Other connecting trails total  in additional length, extending from the <a>Pennsylvania</a> border to <a>Prickett's Fort State Park</a>. Many student groups take day trips to the nearby <a>Coopers Rock State Forest</a>, which is less than  from WVU's campus.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>West Virginia University offers more than 300 student-run organizations and clubs.  Many of the organizations are associated with academia, religion, culture, military service, politics, recreation, or sports. New student groups may be formed by submitting a constitution and petition to  become recognized as a student organization. Descriptions of the larger student  groups are listed below. </p>
<p><strong>Student Government Association (SGA)</strong> serves as the voice of the student body and is the direct liaison to the University administration. SGA members represent  the student interest in University affairs, enacting resolutions to improve student and campus life at WVU.   The organization leadership is composed of the President and Vice President acting as an executive body, the Board of Governors representing a legislative branch,  and the Athletic Council. Other positions include the Attorney General, Treasurer,  Secretary, Off-Campus Housing Director, Public Relations Chair, Elections Chair,  and the Executive Director of the Maniacs. All leadership positions are selected from an open, campus-wide election every spring semester.</p>
<p><strong>Mountaineer Maniacs</strong> is the largest student-run organization on campus,  and the official WVU student section for all athletic events. The demand for membership caused the University to limit enrollment to 3,000 students. The group was founded to promote sportsmanship, increase athletic team awareness, and preserve Mountaineer  traditions.</p>
<p><strong><a>Society of Women Engineers</a> (SWE)</strong> encourages the advancement of women in the field of  engineering as students, professionals, and leaders. Additionally, SWE strives to help  women reach their potential as engineers in the classroom and the workplace.

<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p>[[File:greek-games.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Greek Games on [[Mountainlair]] Plaza during WVU's annual Greek Week]] Approximately 10-15 percent of West Virginia's students are involved in Greek life. There are 15 fraternities and 8 sororities recognized by WVU. Offered free on campus, it generates income through advertisements and student fees.  The paper began in 1887 as a weekly <a>literary magazine</a>, with writing, editing and  production taken over by the newly formed School of Journalism in the 1920s. In 1970,  the paper split from the School of Journalism and became an independent campus entity  governed by the Student Publications Board. The <em>DA</em> was voted as the <em><a>Princeton Review</a>'s</em>  10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005, 15th in 2006, and 8th in 2007. The Daily Athenaeum is an affiliate of <a>UWIRE</a>, which distributes and promotes its  content to their network.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Mountaineer Jeffersonian</em></strong> is an independent news, economic, and political journal  founded by students. Like the <em>DA</em>, it is provided free at multiple locations throughout  campus and the Morgantown area. Advertising revenue and private donations are its only source  of income. The publication was founded in October 2008 with support from the <a>Leadership Institute</a>  and the <a>Collegiate Network</a> and is a continued affiliate of both organizations. Originally printed  once a month, it became a weekly publication in 2009. It became a member of the West Virginia Press  Association in 2009.</p>
<p><strong><a>WWVU-FM</a></strong>, called U92 or The Moose, plays new music, talk shows, and newscasts.  On the air since 1982, U92 can be heard in the Morgantown area at 91.7 FM and also  streams live on the internet. In 2007, the station was one of four college radio stations  nominated for College Music Journal's Station of the Year Award.</p>
<h3>Student health</h3>
<p>The Student Center of Health, also known under the label &quot;Well WVU&quot;, provides services related to student health, disease prevention, and awareness.  The Carruth Center for Psychological and Psychiatric Services offers therapy to any WVU student. The Robert C. Byrd Health Science Center and the associated West Virginia University Hospitals, located on the Health Science Campus, serve as West Virginia's largest  healthcare institution. The hospitals provide a comprehensive set of healthcare needs for local and regional patients. WVU students are provided with full access to the healthcare resources, which are accessible from the PRT medical station.</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p> With a 682&#x2013;449&#x2013;45 record, West Virginia is the winningest Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team to have never won a national championship. WVU has had two undefeated regular seasons; they went 11-0 in 1988 and 1993. However, West Virginia lost both bowl games, 34&#x2013;21 to Notre Dame, and 41&#x2013;7 to Florida. The <a>2005 season</a> and the <a>2006 season</a> produced the first consecutive 11-win seasons in school history. In the <a>2007 season</a>, the Mountaineers started the season as the #3-ranked team, the highest preseason ranking in school history. That team eventually was ranked #1 in the Coaches Poll, and finished the season with a third consecutive 11-win season after their <a>Fiesta Bowl</a> victory.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p> West Virginia men's basketball has competed in three basketball championship final matches: the <a>1959 NCAA final</a>, the 1942 <a>NIT</a> final (at that time, the NIT was considered  more prestigious than the NCAA), and the <a>2007 NIT Championship</a>. They lost 71&#x2013;70 to <a>California</a> in the 1959 final NCAA finals, while the Mountaineers won the <a>1942 NIT Championship</a> 47&#x2013;45 over <a>Western Kentucky</a>, and the 2007 <a>NIT</a> contest over <a>Clemson</a> 78&#x2013;72 in a rebuilding season. In 1949, future Mountaineers head coach, <a>Fred Schaus</a>, became the first player in NCAA history to record 1,000 points.</p>
<p>West Virginia most recently reached the Final Four of the <a>2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>, led by West Virginia coach and former WVU player <a>Bob Huggins</a>. The Mountaineers are the current Big East Conference champions, and received a #2 seed in the East Region of the <a>2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>.</p>
<h3>Marching band</h3>
<p> The West Virginia University Mountaineer Marching Band, nicknamed &quot;The Pride of West Virginia,&quot; is the official marching band of WVU. The 390-member band performs at every home football game and makes several local and national appearances throughout the year. The band was the recipient of the prestigious <a>Sudler Trophy</a> in 1997.</p>
<h3>Fanbase</h3>
<p>[[File:MountaineerManiacsVillanova.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Mountaineer Maniacs student section  perform the first down cheer at a home football game.]] In a state that lacks professional sports franchises, the citizens of <a>West Virginia</a>  passionately support West Virginia University and its athletics teams.  Men's basketball head coach <a>Bob Huggins</a>, a former Mountaineer basketball player who was born in Morgantown, stated that the &quot;strong bond between the university and the people of West Virginia&quot; is a relationship that is difficult for non-natives to understand. Former basketball player <a>Da'Sean Butler</a> cited the fan support as a factor in his decision to play for WVU, saying &quot;everybody loves our school to death&quot; in reference to the fan base in West Virginia. </p>
<p>West Virginia fans have also been recognized for their hospitality. In the first football game played by the <a>University of Connecticut</a> following the death of <a>Jasper Howard</a>, a banner displayed at Mountaineer Field in the Connecticut entrance tunnel read &quot;Today we are all Huskies&quot;. Connecticut  fans described the warmth of the environment as impressive, citing the number of WVU fans  who offered condolences. In a letter to WVU, then UConn head football coach <a>Randy Edsall</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;The response that you gave our team before and after the game was tremendous and greatly appreciated. The pregame moment of silence and team handshake was the most moving experience I have ever had in my 29 years of coaching football.&quot;</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Mountaineer Maniacs</strong> is the largest student-run organization on campus,  and the official WVU student section for all athletic events. The group was founded to promote sportsmanship, increase atheltic team awareness, and preserve Mountaineer  traditions.</p>
<p>Some WVU fans, primarily in the student sections, have developed a reputation for unruly behavior, being compared to &quot;soccer hooligans&quot;  by <a>GQ</a> magazine.  At some events, there have been cases of objects thrown onto the field or at opposing teams.   There were previously also issues with small-scale fires, most notably of couches, being set after games; over 1,100 intentionally-ignited street fires were reported from 1997 to 2003. A new Mountaineer is selected each year during the final two men's home basketball games, with the formal title &quot;The Mountaineer of West Virginia University.&quot; The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when appropriate and safe. The mascot travels with most sports teams throughout the academic year. While not required, male mascots traditionally grow a beard. </p>
<p><strong>The &quot;Flying WV&quot;</strong> is the most widely used logo in West Virginia athletics.  It debuted in 1980 as a part of a football uniform redesign by Coach <a>Don Nehlen</a>, and was adopted as the official logo for the University in 1983. While the &quot;Flying WV&quot; represents all university entities, unique logos are occasionally used for individual departments. Some examples include the script West Virginia logo for the WVU Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the interlocking WV logo used in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Fight songs</strong> of West Virginia University include &quot;<a>Hail, West Virginia</a>&quot; and &quot;Fight Mountaineers.&quot; However, the fan response to <a>John Denver</a>'s &quot;<a>Country Roads</a>&quot; has made it the unofficial song of the university and the state of West Virginia.  The <a>West Virginia University Alma Mater</a> was composed in 1937, and is sung before every home football game. The crowd sings along as the WVU Marching Band stands playing it on the field, as part of the pre-game show.</p>
<p><strong>Old gold and blue</strong>, the official University colors, were selected by the upperclassmen of 1890 from the West Virginia state seal. In 1980 <a>John Denver</a> performed his hit song <em>&quot;<a>Take Me Home, Country Roads</a>&quot;</em> at the dedication of <a>Mountaineer Field</a>, and it has since become  tradition for fans to remain in the stands following every <a>Mountaineer</a> victory and sing the song with the players. Although the tradition originated during  football games, it is now recognized throughout the University,  with the song being performed at various athletic events and ceremonies. <a>Sports Illustrated</a> named the singing of <em>&quot;Country Roads&quot;</em> as one of the must-see  college traditions.</p>
<p><strong><a>The Pride of West Virginia</a></strong> is the official marching band of the University. The band's football pre-game show includes traditions such as the Drumline's &quot;Tunnel&quot; and &quot;Boogie&quot; cadences, the 220-beat per minute run-on cadence to start the performance, marching the &quot;WV&quot; logo down field to the University fight song, &quot;Fight Mountaineers,&quot; expanding circles during <em><a>Simple Gifts</a></em>, and the formation of the state's outline during &quot;<a>Hail, West Virginia</a>&quot;.  </p>
<p><strong>The Firing of the Rifle</strong> is a tradition carried out by the Mountaineer Mascot to open several athletic events.  The Mountaineer points the gun into the air with one arm and fires a blank shot from a custom rifle, a signal to the crowd to begin cheering at home football and basketball games. The Mountaineer also fires the rifle every time the team scores during football games.</p>
<p><strong>The Carpet roll</strong> is a <a>WVU Men's Basketball</a> tradition. In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for  Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball.  The University continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player Gale Catlett reintroduced the carpet when he returned to  West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men's basketball team.</p>
