<p> <strong>Washington &amp; Jefferson College</strong>, also known as <strong>W &amp; J College</strong> or <strong>W&amp;J</strong>, is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Washington, Pennsylvania</a>, which is  south of <a>Pittsburgh</a>.  The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in <a>Washington County</a> established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the <a>American frontier</a> in the 1780s: <a>John McMillan</a>, <a>Thaddeus Dod</a>, and <a>Joseph Smith</a>. These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in <a>Canonsburg</a> and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington. These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College.  The  campus, located in Washington, Pennsylvania, has more than 40 buildings, with the oldest dating to 1793.  While the college has historically had a difficult relationship with the city of Washington, including clashes over college expansion and finances, recent efforts have been made to improve those relations.</p>
<p>The college's academic emphasis is on the liberal arts and the sciences, with a focus on preparing students for graduate and professional schools.  Campus activities include various religious, political, and general interest clubs, as well as academic and professional-themed organizations.  The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges.  Students operate a college radio station, a campus newspaper, and a literary journal.  The athletic program competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a>. The football team has been particularly successful over its history, even competing in the <a>1922 Rose Bowl</a>.  A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics.  Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one third are members of fraternities or sororities.  A number of noteworthy alumni have attended the college or its predecessor institutions, including <a>James G. Blaine</a>, <a>William Holmes McGuffey</a>, and <a>Pete Henry</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Early history and the academies</h3>
<p>Washington &amp; Jefferson College traces its origin to three log cabin colleges established by three frontier clergymen in the 1780s: <a>John McMillan</a>, <a>Thaddeus Dod</a>, and <a>Joseph Smith</a>.  John McMillan, the most prominent of the three founders because of his strong personality and longevity, came to the area in 1775 and built his log cabin college in 1780 near his church in <a>Chartiers</a>. [[File:McMillan Hall W&amp;J College 4.jpg|thumb|left|Washington Academy's sole building (now called [[McMillan Hall]]), showing the original central portion and the two wings added in 1818.]] Washington Academy was chartered by the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> on September 24, 1787.  The first members of the board of trustees included Reverends Dod and Smith.  At an subsequent unknown date, McMillan transferred his students from the log cabin to Canonsburg Academy.  In 1806, <a>Matthew Brown</a> petitioned the <a>Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> to grant Washington Academy a charter, allowing it to be re-christened as Washington College.  At various times over the next 60 years, the various parties within the two colleges pursued unification with each other, but the question of where the unified college would be located thwarted those efforts.  In the ensuing years, both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves, especially over-selling scholarships.  Desperate for funds, Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling to take control of the college, a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time.  However, Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances.</p>
<h3>Unification of the colleges</h3>
<p>[[File:Old Main W&amp;J 1880s.jpg|thumb|left|The two identical towers on [[Old Main (Washington &amp; Jefferson College)|Old Main]] symbolize the 1865 union of Jefferson College and Washington College to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College.]] Following the <a>Civil War</a>, both colleges were short on students and on funds, causing them to join together as Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 1865.  The charter provided for the college to operate at both Canonsburg and Washington, a position that caused significant difficulty an the administration trying to rescue the college amid ill feelings over the unification.  Edwards immediately encountered significant challenges, including the difficulties of administering a college across two campuses, as well as old prejudices and hard feelings among those still loyal to either Jefferson College or Washington College.  Leadership of the college during this time fell to <a>Samuel J. Wilson</a>,a local pastor, and <a>James I. Brownson</a>, who had earlier been interim president of Washington College.  By 1871, the <a>United States Supreme Court</a> upheld the consolidation, allowing the newly-configured college to proceed.  His successor, <a>James D. Moffat</a>, led the college through a period of growth where the college constructed the <a>Old Gym</a>, <a>Hays Hall</a>, <a>Thompson Memorial Library</a>, and <a>Thistle Physics Building</a>, as well as purchasing the land known as the &quot;old fair ground,&quot; now used for <a>Cameron Stadium</a>.  Towards the end of his term, Moffat personally paid for the 1912 renovations of <a>McMillan Hall</a>.  In 1914, <a>Frederick W. Hinitt</a> was elected president. His tenure was dominated by the United States' entry into <a>World War I</a>, with an enrollment drop of 50%.  <a>William E. Slemmons</a>, a college trustee and adjunct professor, succeeded Hinitt and served as interim president from May 1918 to June 1919.  After the war ended in 1919, <a>Samuel Charles Black</a> took over and helped to stabilize the enrollment.  His successor, <a>Simon Strousse Baker</a>, was well-liked by the college's trustees and by &quot;many a townsman,&quot; but the student body felt that Baker was &quot;autocratic&quot; and held an &quot;unfriendly attitude toward the student body as individuals.&quot;  Baker defended himself, saying that the perceived ill-will towards students was unintentional and a misunderstanding.  In an effort to strengthen the college's science department, Hutchison extended and expanded the southern portion of the campus, adding the <a>Lazear Chemistry Hall</a> and purchasing <a>McIlvane Hall</a>.  When <a>World War II</a> broke out, the campus was opened to the Army Administration School, where hundreds of soldiers received their &quot;training in classifications.&quot;  Hutchison resigned in 1945 to take the presidency of his alma mater, <a>Lafayette College</a>.  In 1950, <a>Boyd Crumrine Patterson</a> assumed the presidency and oversaw curriculum revisions and the construction of a number of buildings, including the <a>Henry Memorial Center</a>, 10 <a>Greek</a> housing units in the center of campus, the <a>U. Grant Miller Library</a>, the Student Center, the Commons, and two new dormitories.  His fundrasing abilities grew the college's endowment expanded from $2.3 million to nearly $11 million.  Patterson retired in 1970, the same year that the trustees authorized the admission of women as undergraduate students.  The college also adopted a new <a>academic calendar</a> to include <a>intersession</a> and expanded its academic programs to include the Entrepreneurial Studies Program, the Freshman Forum, and several cooperative international education programs.  In 2004, <a>Tori Haring-Smith</a> became the first woman to serve as president of Washington &amp; Jefferson, undertaking an effort to improve the science curriculum and to construct the <a>Swanson Science Center</a>. <img></p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>As a <a>liberal arts college</a>, Washington &amp; Jefferson College focuses exclusively on <a>undergraduate education</a>. The college's teaching environment reflects the liberal arts tradition of small group instruction by maintaining an average class size of 17 and a <a>student/faculty ratio</a> of 12:1. 85% of faculty have <a>terminal degree</a>s and no classes are taught by <a>teaching assistant</a>s.</p>
<p>The college has a focus on preparing students for graduate school and professional programs.  Across all disciplines, 85% to 90% of students who apply to such programs receive offers of admission.  Among students who apply to medical school or related health graduate programs, 90% of students gain admission.  Approximately 11% of all current W&amp;J alumni are physicians and engineers, making the college third in the nation per capita for producing doctors and scientific researchers.  Among students who apply to law school, approximately 90% of students gain admission.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The curriculum is centered around the traditional <a>liberal arts</a> education and <a>pre-professional classes</a>.  All first-semester <a>freshmen</a> must complete the &quot;First Year Seminar&quot; class, which introduces new students to a variety of lectures, concerts, plays, and trips to museums or galleries based on a different course theme selected each year.  In addition to completing an <a>academic major</a>, students must satisfy the college-wide <a>general education requirements</a>, which include classes in the <a>arts</a>, <a>humanities</a>, <a>natural sciences</a> and <a>mathematics</a>, <a>foreign languages</a>, <a>cultural diversity</a>, and academic skills classes including <a>writing</a>, <a>oral communication</a>, <a>quantitative reasoning</a>.  Additionally, all students must complete a <a>physical education</a> requirement, amounting to one full semester class, making W&amp;J one of the few liberal arts colleges without a physical education major to have such a requirement.  The college maintains a number of combined degree programs, allowing students to attend <a>graduate</a> or professional school in lieu of senior year. Past Intersession courses have included &quot;Emerging Diseases: Global and Local&quot; in the biology department, &quot;Corporate Failures, Frauds, and Scandals&quot; in the business department, and &quot;Vampires and Other Bloodsuckers&quot; in the English department, &quot;Holocaust Survivor Narratives&quot; in the German department, and &quot;Alternative Radio&quot; in the communications department.</p>
<p>At various times, the faculty organizes an &quot;Integrated Semester,&quot; where professors organize regular departmental courses, specialized projects, and public events dealing with a common interdisciplinary theme.  Students can also pursue international education through 30 pre-approved programs in over 20 counties.  Members of the <a>National Guard of the United States</a> may take online classes to earn an <a>associate's degree</a> in Information Technology Leadership or a certificate in Information Management and Security.  Students may undertake <a>externship</a>s to gain <a>experiential learning</a> experience in their chosen field.  The Franklin Internship Awards, established in 2006 by Ellis Hyman, provide upperclassmen with financial assistance to take an unpaid internship.  The college's Magellan Project is a series of programs that provide support and financing for research and independent study projects.  Past Magellan Projects have allowed students to study the <a>Invasion of Normandy</a>, Mexican transportation systems, and to volunteer at <a>medical missions</a> in the <a>Dominican Republic</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission and rankings</h3>
<p>Admission to Washington &amp; Jefferson College is classified as &quot;more selective&quot; by both the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a> and <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>.</em>  The college extends offers of admission to 38.2% of all applicants.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> college rankings, Washington &amp; Jefferson is ranked #92 of all liberal arts colleges in the nation, placing it within &quot;Tier 1.&quot;  <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> ranked the college #132 among all American liberal arts colleges in terms of <a>social mobility</a>, research, and <a>community service</a>.  The rankings listed the college as #30 in the nation in terms of <a>Federal Work-Study Program</a> money spent of community service.  She also questioned the &quot;peer assessment&quot; portion of the rankings and suggested that college presidents are rarely aware of educational improvements in their peer institutions; she noted that Washington &amp; Jefferson College's ranking has remained the same for a number of years, even while the college made significant improvements acceptance rates and overall selectivity, the addition of academic programs, and the construction of additional buildings.  She has signed the &quot;<a>Presidents Letter</a>,&quot; a nation-wide movement asking fellow college presidents to decline participation in the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> reputation survey, a subjective evaluation where college administrators score their competition.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p> As of 2010, the student body totaled 1,519 students.  The student body is highly residential, with 98% of students residing in campus housing.  Approximately 18% of the student body receives federal <a>Pell Grant</a>s.  Like the population of Pennsylvania and the United States as a whole, the largest ethnic group at the college is <a>White American</a>, making up about 82% of the student population.  Roughly 10% of the student population does not specify their ethnicity.  In 2009, the college was named to the <a>President&#x2019;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, in recognition of the student body's commitment to community service.  The college's spends 22% of its <a>Federal Work-Study Program</a> funds on <a>community service</a> projects.  The  campus is home to more than 40 academic, administrative, recreational, and residential buildings.  Portions of the campus extend into the <a>East Washington Historic District</a>.  Four historic gates mark four traditional entrances to campus at East Maiden Street, Wheeling Street, South College Street, and Beau Street.</p>
<p>The oldest surviving building is <a>McMillan Hall</a>, which dates to 1793 and is the oldest college building west of the <a>Allegheny Mountains</a>.  The main academic building is <a>Old Main</a>, which is topped with two prominent towers.  The <a>Old Gym</a> houses a modern exercise facility.  McIlvaine Hall, which was originally home to a female seminary, was demolished in 2008 and replaced by the <a>Swanson Science Center</a>.  Davis Memorial Hall was once a dormitory and private house.  The Thistle Physics Building, the Lazear Chemistry Hall, and the Dieter-Porter Life Sciences Building all cater to the scientific curriculum.  <a>The Burnett Center</a> and its sister building, the <a>Technology Center</a>, were built in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>&lt;!--Is far too much linking to dormitory pages in this paragraph. See <a>WP:ELNO</a> and <a>WP:BOMBARD</a> --&gt; The first dormitory on campus was <a>Hays Hall</a>.  Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House are <a>Victorian</a> homes housing older students.  The recently-constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides housing for the college's <a>Greek organizations</a>.  The Presidents' Row is a cluster of ten buildings in the center of campus, several of which are dedicated to theme housing.  Two sister dormitories, New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall, feature suite-style living arrangements.  Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall house male freshmen.  Other dormitories include Alexander Hall, Beau Hall, Marshall Hall, North Hall, and Penn House.  The college administration utilizes several buildings, including the Admissions House, the Alumni House, and the President&#x2019;s House, which are all modified Victorian homes.  The Hub, The Commons, and the Rossin Campus Center provide recreational and dining facilities for students.  The <a>athletic</a> and <a>intramural teams</a> utilize <a>Cameron Stadium</a> for <a>football</a> and track.  The <a>Henry Memorial Center</a> is used for basketball, wrestling, swimming, and volleyball.  Other athletic facilities include <a>Brooks Park</a>, <a>Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium</a>, and the Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<h3>Intercollegiate</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|Cameron Stadium</a> W&amp;J competes in 23 intercollegiate athletics at the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) <a>Division III</a> level.  As of the 2009&#x2013;10 academic year, the Presidents have won more than 108 <a>Presidents' Athletic Conference</a> (PAC) championships, 40 students were selected as conference <a>Most Valuable Player</a>, more than 300 athletes were awarded First Team All-Conference recognition, 75 received All-American honors, and 25 achieved Academic All-American status.  During the 2005&#x2013;2006 season, 34 percent of the student body played varsity-level athletics. W&amp;J also fields teams in field hockey, wrestling, baseball, softball, and volleyball, as well as men's and women's cross country running, soccer, tennis, water polo, basketball, swimming and diving, golf, lacrosse, and track &amp; field.</p>
<h3>Intramural</h3>
<p>The <a>intramural sports</a> program is one of the most consistently popular activities at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, providing non-varsity and recreational athletic activities for all students, faculty, and staff of the College.  In 2002, 60% of students participated in intramural sports.  In 2006, more that 40% of the student body participated in intramural athletics.  Intramural champions win a t-shirt celebrating their victory.  During that time, the management of intramural activities was transferred to the athletic department, allowing the intramural program to use the College's varsity facilities.  Two other literary societies were founded at Washington College, the Union Literary Society in 1809 and the Washington Literary Society in 1814.  These four <a>college literary societies</a> had intense rivalries with each other, competing in &quot;contests,&quot; which pitted select society members against another in &quot;compositions, speaking select orations and debating,&quot; with the <a>trustees</a> selecting the victor.  In the years after the union of the two colleges, these four literary societies merged with the Franklin Literary Society, which survives today.</p>
<h3>Art scene</h3>
<p>Washington &amp; Jefferson College is home to a vibrant student art and musical scene.  The artistic center of campus is the Olin Fine Arts Center, with an art gallery and a 486-seat auditorium.  The Department of Music offers majors and minors in music.  The Department of Theatre and Communications offers a major and minor in theatre.  Current musical organizations include the W&amp;J Wind Ensemble, the W&amp;J Jazz Ensemble, the W&amp;J Choir and the Camerata Singers.  Former musical organizations include the Banjo, Mandolin &amp; Guitar Club and the College Band.  Every year since 2003, the Theater Department has produced the <em>Winter Tales</em> series, an annual production of one-act plays written by members of the W&amp;J community, students, alumni, faculty, administration, and staff, and prouduced by the W&amp;J Student Theater Company.</p>
<p>In addition to student-produced art and music, the College provides a number of opportunities to view art and music from the larger art community.  The College holds a collection of paintings by distinguished regional artist <a>Malcolm Parcell</a>, which are displayed in several locations on campus.  The most prominent location is the Malcom Parcell Room in The Commons, which is part of the student dining area.  The W&amp;J Arts Series is an annual collection of musicians, singers, and other artistic performers appearing at the Olin Fine Arts Center.  Past shows have included <a>Di Wu</a>, <a>Habib Koit&#x00e9;</a>, <a>Chris Potter</a>, <a>The Aquila Theatre Company</a> presenting <em><a>The Invisible Man</a>,</em> <a>Eroica Trio</a>, <a>Oni Buchanan</a>, <a>Tommy Sands</a>, <a>Cavani String Quartet</a>, <a>Sergio and Odar Assad</a>, and <a>Sandip Burman</a>.  In 1999, billionaire <a>W&amp;J alum</a> and well-known opera philanthropist <a>Alberto Vilar</a> sponsored the Vilar Distinguished Artist Series, which brought a number of world-class classical performers to perform at the Olin Fine Arts Center at no cost to students.  In 2003, amid Vilar's falling fortunes during the <a>stock market decreases in 2001 and 2002</a>, the Vilar Distinguished Artist Series went on a temporary hiatus.  Vilar's 2005 indictment for financial fraud ended any possibility of reviving the arts series.  In Fall 2003, the W&amp;J Arts Series, the college's other art series, was expanded to partially compensate for the loss.  The Student Government Association organizes the annual Fall Concert and Spring Concert, which bring <a>popular music</a>al acts to campus.  Past Spring and Fall concerts have included <a>Cobra Starship</a>, <a>Girl Talk</a>, <a>N.E.R.D.</a> <a>New Found Glory</a>, <a>Saves the Day</a>, and local favorite <a>The Clarks</a>.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p> [[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&amp;J College.jpg|thumb|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] pose for a chapter photo in the early 1870s.]] With 37% of the student body participating in &quot;greek life,&quot; fraternities and sororities play a significant role in student life at W&amp;J.  <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> named Washington &amp; Jefferson College 12th on their 2010 list of &quot;Major Frat and Sorority Scene&quot; in the United States.  As of 2010, the Office of Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life recognized 6 fraternities, <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a>, <a>Beta Theta Pi</a>, <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, and <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a>, and four sororities, <a>Delta Gamma</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a>, and <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>.  The fraternities are governed by a local <a>Interfraternal Council</a> and the sororities are governed by a local <a>Panhellenic Council</a>, while the Greek Judiciary manages broad policy violations at the chapter-level.  All members of fraternities and sororities must pay the $100 &quot;Greek Membership Fee,&quot; a levy designed to fund leadership seminars and other educational events for greeks.</p>
<p>Two national fraternities were founded at Jefferson College, <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a> in 1848 and <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a> in 1852.  Together, they are collectively known as the <a>Jefferson Duo</a>.  A third fraternity was founded at Jefferson College, <a>Kappa Phi Lambda</a>, but it dissolved after a decade of existence amid a dispute between chapters.  In 1874, a fourth fraternity was founded at W&amp;J, the short-lived <a>Phi Delta Kappa</a>.  The new fraternity grew to several chapters before falling apart in 1880.  This approval process does not authorize any club to act on behalf of the college, nor does approval indicate any the college's agreement with the club's purpose.  A number of student clubs are dedicated to encouraging interest is a specific academic discipline, including the &quot;W&amp;J Denominators&quot; mathematics club, the <a>Society of Physics Students</a>, and the Pre-Health Professions Society.  All students, regardless of academic major, are eligible to contribute to these media organizations. The <em>Red &amp; Black</em> features local and national news, student opinion, and college athletics coverage.  Student on-air personalities produce radio programs including music, <a>news</a>, <a>talk</a>, and <a>sports</a>.  It serves the <a>Pittsburgh Designated Market Area</a>, reaching north to the <a>northern Pittsburgh suburbs</a>, east to <a>Monessen</a>, south to <a>Waynesburg</a> and west to the <a>West Virginia Panhandle</a>.  The Wooden Tooth Review is a student-edited <a>literary journal</a>, featuring short fiction and poetry submitted by members of the student body.  The editorial board is organized as a recognized student club, with a faculty advisor.  The journal was founded in 1999, with the Coordinator of Creative Writing serving as the first faculty advisor.  The college's <a>yearbook</a>, <em>Pandora</em>, is produced annually by a student staff.</p>
<h2>Housing and student life facilities</h2>
<p>The college offers &quot;Theme Community Living,&quot; where students with common interests live in a single living unit.  Past themes have included the &quot;Intensive Study,&quot; the &quot;Service Leadership Community,&quot; the &quot;International House,&quot; &quot;Music House,&quot; the &quot;WashPA Radio Theme Community&quot; for students who participate in the <a>WNJR</a> college radio station, and the &quot;Pet House&quot;.  Students proposing a theme community must develop an educational plan centered around the theme.  Not all types of pets are permitted, only permits students to bring cats, small dogs, small birds, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, and fish.  The college began the pet house program in 2006, an is one of a dozen schools nationwide to have such a program.  The Pet House has been profiled in <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, the <em><a>USA Today</a></em>, <em><a>Observer-Reporter</a></em>, and <a>KDKA</a>.</p>
<h2>Traditions and lore</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|A game of pushball between the freshman and sophomore classes</a> One of the oldest traditions at Washington &amp; Jefferson College were the &quot;Freshman Rules,&quot; a system of rules and restrictions on freshmen.  During the 1870s and 1880s, the students engaged in organized athletic competitions, pitting the freshman versus sophomore classes in the &quot;Olympic Games&quot; that involved elaborate opening ceremonies and the smoking of a &quot;<a>Pipe of Peace</a>.&quot;  Another form of physical contest between the freshman and sophomore classes were the annual &quot;color rush,&quot; where the teams fought over control over strips of fabric, the &quot;pole rush,&quot; where the teams battled to raise a flag up a flagpole, and the &quot;cane rush&quot; where the teams fought over control over a ceremonial cane.  The college's <a>fight song</a>, <em><a>Good Ole W&amp;J</a></em> is sung to the tune of <em><a>99 Bottles of Beer</a></em> and makes fun of a number of rival colleges, including the <a>University of Pittsburgh</a> and the <a>Washington Female Seminary</a>.</p>
<h2>Symbols of the college</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|A depreciated graphic treatment for the college  The top portion, showing two towers, representing Washington College and Jefferson College, and three stars, representing the McMillan, Dod, and Smith log cabins.  The coat of arms may appear with a banner underneath showing the college motto.</p>
<p>The college's current logo features a stylized version of the two towers of <a>Old Main</a>, symbolizing the 1865 unification of Washington College and Jefferson College.  The logo may be displayed in several versions: with the entire name of the college, the shortened form of &quot;W&amp;J&quot;, or without any text.  The relationship between the town and college were strong enough that the citizens of Washington offered a $50,000 donation in 1869 to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby <a>Canonsburg</a> as the consolidated location of the college.  However, the relationship was strained through most of the 20th century, as the college pursued an expansion policy that clashed with the residential neighborhood.  The college's frustrations grew after preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to pass laws prohibiting the college from demolishing certain buildings that were listed on the <a>East Washington Historic District</a>.  Relations were so bad that residents and college officials engaged in a shouting match at a meeting.  Local preservationists also unsuccessfully tried to block the demolition of <a>Hays Hall</a>, which had been condemned.  In the 1990s, the city of Washington made several unsuccessful attempts to challenge the college's tax-exempt status.  In 1993, Washington appealed the Washington County Board of Assessment's determination that the college was exempt from the city's <a>property tax</a>.  That case went to the <a>Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a>, which ruled in favor of the college.  Separately, the city of Washington passed an ordinance that levied a municipal &quot;service fee&quot; against the College students, which was ruled to be illegal and was struck down.  In the late 1990s, the college and town tried to mend fences through the <em><a>Blueprint for Collaboration</a></em>, a plan with detailed goals and benchmarks for the future to help the college and the city work together on economic development, environmental protection, and historic preservation.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
