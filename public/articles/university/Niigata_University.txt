It was established in 1949 and has its major origins in Niigata Medical College (established in 1922) and in Niigata Higher School (established in 1919). It is one of the largest Japanese national universities on the <a>Sea of Japan</a>.</p>

The medical faculties (Medicine and Dentistry) are located in Asahimachi Campus in the downtown. Attached schools (an elementary school, a junior high school and a school for children with special needs) are located in Nishi Ohata district next to Asahimachi Campus (also in <a>Nagaoka City</a>). In a building next to <a>Niigata Station</a> there is a small campus named Tokimate (, former &quot;CLLIC&quot;), whose main purpose is to offer courses of <a>lifelong learning</a> for adults.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The oldest origin of the university was Kyoritsu Hospital (a temporary hospital) founded in 1870. It was reestablished in 1873 as Private Niigata Hospital, which became a prefectural hospital in 1876.</p>
<p>In 1901 five national medical schools were established in <a>Chiba</a>, <a>Sendai</a>, <a>Okayama</a>, <a>Kanazawa</a> and <a>Nagasaki</a>. The municipal and prefectural governments of Niigata demanded a national medical school from the Ministry of Education, but the plan was deferred because of the <a>Russo-Japanese War</a>. Later in 1910 Niigata Medical School was founded, and the former Niigata Hospital became its clinical facility. In 1922 the medical school was chartered as .</p>
<p>The municipal and prefectural governments of Niigata and the local industrial firms further wanted the medical college to be developed into an <a>imperial university</a> (so-called <a>Hokuriku</a> Imperial University) and competed with <a>Kanazawa</a>. But the trials did not succeed until the end of <a>World War II</a>.</p>
<p>In 1949 seven colleges (Niigata Medical College, Niigata Higher School, Niigata First Normal School, Niigata Second Normal School, Niigata Youth Normal School, Niigata Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry College, and Nagaoka College of Technology) were integrated to constitute <strong>Niigata University</strong> under Japan's new educational system. The university was inaugurated with the Faculties of Humanities, Education, Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture.</p>
<p>In 1965 the Faculty of Dentistry was established. The faculties (except Medicine and Dentistry) began moving to new Ikarashi Campus in 1968, and the removals finished in the 1980s. In 1977 the Faculty of Humanities was reorganized into the Faculty of Law and Literature, then divided into three faculties (Humanities, Law, and Economics) in 1980. The university became a national university corporation in 2004.</p>
