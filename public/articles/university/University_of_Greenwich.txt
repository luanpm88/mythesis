<h2>History</h2>

<p>The history of the University dates back to 1890, when Woolwich Polytechnic was founded as the second-oldest Polytechnic of the United Kingdom. In 1970, Woolwich Polytechnic merged with various other higher education institutions to form Thames Polytechnic. In the following years, Dartford College (1976), Avery Hill College (1985), <a>Garnett College</a> (1987) and parts of <a>Goldsmiths College</a> and the <a>City of London College</a> (1988) were incorporated, extending considerably the range of subjects taught. </p>
<p>In 1992, the century-old Thames Polytechnic was granted university status by the <a>Major</a> government (together with various other polytechnics) and renamed University of Greenwich. Traditionally, the institution has focused on engineering, mathematics, computing and natural science. In recent decades, its Business School has become a particular strength.</p>
<p>Since the 19th century, the University has expanded from a technical institution to teach a range of subjects across engineering, natural sciences, social sciences, humanities and business. Its research focus is applied science with strong links to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Since 2004, it has been run by Vice Chancellor Tessa Blackstone. Blackstone, a Labour <a>life peer</a>, was previously Master of Birkbeck College. She served as Minister for Education (1997&#x2013;2001) and Minister for Arts (2001&#x2013;2003) of the United Kingdom under the Labour government.</p>
<h2>Teaching and research</h2>
<p>[[Image:University of greenwich in london.jpg|thumb|350px|left|University of Greenwich from [[Isle of Dogs]]]] The University won the <a>Queen's Anniversary Prizes for Higher and Further Education in 2008</a>. It also has links with <a>further education</a> colleges in the <a>Thames Gateway</a> area, including Bexley College and North West Kent College, and plays a regional role in training <a>teacher</a>s, <a>nurses</a> and social care professionals. In addition, since taking over the UKs only specialist lecturer training college (<a>Garnett College</a>) it has become a major centre for training further education lecturers. It also includes Greenwich Maritime Institute, a freestanding department in the university with links in the maritime business community, teaching maritime policy and management and maritime history. </p>
<p>The University established the Medway School of Pharmacy jointly with the University of Kent. </p>
<p>In March 2005 it was announced that Greenwich would be one of three British universities charging less than the &#x00a3;3000-per-year limit to be introduced from academic year 2006. After consultation with students, Greenwich will charge &#x00a3;2,500 for its undergraduate courses. Vice-chancellor Baroness Blackstone said this was &quot;a reflection of our wish to attract students from a wide range of backgrounds&quot;.</p>
<p>Greenwich also houses research and consultancy in <a>architecture</a>, <a>landscape architecture</a>,  <a>employment relations</a>, <a>fire safety</a>, natural resources, <a>social network analysis</a>, <a>education</a>, <a>training</a>, <a>educational leadership</a> and <a>public services</a>. The University of Greenwich has established research partnerships with the European Space Agency and the large pharmaceutical companies. Support comes as well from the Indian government and Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The University of Greenwich has recently established the <a>Institute of Converging Arts and Sciences</a>, directed by Professor <a>Sue Golding</a>, to examine the development of digital technology, its aesthetics and philosophy. The inaugural conference of the Institute in October 2009 included a public lecture by Dame <a>Wendy Hall</a>. Another research center is the Natural Resources Institute in Medway, Kent.</p>
