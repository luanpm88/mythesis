<p><strong>Keele University</strong> is a <a>campus university</a> located near <a>Newcastle-under-Lyme</a> in <a>Staffordshire</a>, <a>England</a>. Founded in 1949 as an experimental college dedicated to a broad curriculum and <a>interdisciplinary study</a>, Keele is most notable for pioneering the <a>dual honours</a> degree in Britain. The University occupies a 617 <a>acre</a> (2.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) rural campus close to the village of <a>Keele</a> and houses a Science Park and a conference centre, making it the largest single-site campus university in the UK. The University is committed to further growth, with the stated objective of increasing its numbers to 10,000 full-time students. who had first suggested a &quot;people's university&quot; in an address to the North Staffordshire <a>Workers' Educational Association</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>On 13 March 1946, Lindsay wrote to <a>Sir Walter Moberly</a>, chair of the <a>University Grants Committee</a> (UGC), suggesting the establishment of a college &#x201c;on new lines&#x201d;.  Established practice was for new colleges to be launched without degree-awarding powers, instead taking external degrees of the University of London. Crucially, Lindsay wanted to &#x201c;get rid of the London external degree&#x201d;, instead forming a college with the authority from the start to set its own syllabus, perhaps acting under the sponsorship of an established university. Lindsay wrote also to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, tentatively requesting just such sponsorship.  Having secured public funding from the UGC in January 1948, the Committee acquired <a>Keele Hall</a>, a stately home on the outskirts of Newcastle-under-Lyme, from its owner, Ralph Sneyd.  The Hall, ancestral residence of the Sneyd family, had previously been requisitioned by the <a>War Office</a> for military use during World War II, and was supplied with the bulk of the Sneyd estate and a number of prefabricated structures erected by the Army, for the sum of &#x00a3;31,000. and adopting the name <strong>The University of Keele</strong>. This remains the official name, although <strong>Keele University</strong> is now the name used by the University itself. Its promotion made Keele <a>one of</a> the first <a>Plate glass universities</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In 1968, the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965&#x2013;68) issued its report (popularly known as the Todd Report), which considered the possibility of a medical school being established at Keele University. It was generally considered that North Staffordshire would be a good site for a new medical school, having a large local population and several large hospitals. However, it was considered that a minimum intake of 150 students a year would be necessary to make a medical school at Keele economically and educationally viable, and it was considered that Keele University was at that time too small an institution to be able to support a medical school of this size. However, in 1978, Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine opened. This department conducted medical research, and played a part in postgraduate medical education, but did not teach undergraduate medical students. This was followed, in 2002, by medical students from <a>Manchester Medical School</a> being taught at Keele, eventually leading to Keele's own medical school starting in 2007.</p>
<p>In 1994, the Oswestry and North Staffordshire School of Physiotherapy (ONSSP), which had been a separate institution based at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry, Shropshire, merged with Keele University, becoming Keele's Department of Physiotherapy Studies, and relocating from <a>Oswestry</a> to the Keele University campus.  In August 1995, Keele University merged with North Staffordshire College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming the new School of Nursing and Midwifery.</p>
<p>In 1998 and 1999 there was some controversy over the decision by University authorities to sell the Turner Collection, a valuable collection of mathematical printed books including some which had belonged to - and had been heavily annotated by - <a>Isaac Newton</a>, in order to fund major improvements to the University Library. Senior University officials authorised the sale of the collection to a private buyer, with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although legally permissible, the sale was unpopular among the academic community and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the &#x00a3;1m sale price was too low and that the collection was certain to be broken up.</p>
<p>Due to declining popularity and funding, Keele closed its <a>German</a> department in December 2004, though retained its physics degree despite the subject facing similar pressures.</p>
<p>In 2009, the University was awarded one of the <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a>s for Higher and Further Education, for &quot;pioneering work with the NHS in early intervention and primary care in the treatment of chronic pain and arthritis, linking research to delivery to patients through GP networks and user groups.&quot;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

<p>Keele has stated that its goal is to become the &quot;ultimate 21st-century campus university&quot;. The university is located on a 617 <a>acre</a> (2.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) estate. A largely rural area, it is surrounded with wildlife, greenery, and 19th century architecture. Despite this, it also lies minutes away from <a>Newcastle-under-Lyme</a> and <a>Stoke-on-Trent</a>, and just over an hour from major cities such as <a>Birmingham</a>, <a>Manchester</a>, and <a>Liverpool</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, the university received planning permission to begin a building programme on a  portion of the <a>campus</a>. This will include a mixture of academic and residential buildings to accommodate the planned increase in student numbers.</p>
<h3>Halls of residence</h3>
<p>There are five halls of residence on the main campus: Barnes, Lindsay, Holly Cross, The Oaks and Horwood. Hawthorns Hall is located off site in <a>Keele Village</a> just outside the main entrance. These halls provide accommodation for approximately 70% of all full-time students. Another building anomaly is the seventh floor of O Block in Horwood. Although the top storey has windows and walls, the roof was never added.</p>
<p>Students in their first or final year are guaranteed accommodation, provided they apply in time. The same team also made runner up to <a>Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge</a> (1979) in the 2002 special; <em>University Challenge: Reunited</em>.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s Keele attracted the attention of the national press and television news when some students founded a 'cuddling society' and a 'mass cuddle' was filmed in the car park outside the students union.</p>
<p>The post-modern sculpture situated outside Keele's Library was stolen by a visiting sports team only to be later retrieved and securely fitted. In 2005 the same statue was damaged in protest of the University's policy of fining regulations against its undergraduate students.</p>
<p>In 2007, Keele University students were responsible for getting Keele featured as a location on the UK 'Here and Now' version of the traditional board game <a>Monopoly</a>. People in the UK had an opportunity to vote for which places should make the board, and Keele was the highest &quot;wild-card&quot; location which made it on. It even finished higher on the board than <a>London</a>, and takes the place of &quot;Fleet Street&quot; in the game. Later that year, Keele students won a competition hosted by <a>O2</a> via <a>Facebook</a> called &quot;The battle for the UK's favourite university&quot;, scoring over 172,000 points by uploading photos, videos and making wall posts on the group. The prize for winning the competition was a party at their students union, hosted by O2.</p>
<h3>Kube Radio</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There is also a very popular student radio station called <a>Kube Radio</a>, broadcast over the Internet. This station is currently the most internationally acclaimed student radio station with awards from both the New York Festivals and the European Radio Awards both for Best Online Only Radio Station.</p>
<h2>Reputation and academic organisation</h2>
<p>The University's distinctive profile reflects the aims of its founders: breadth of study and community atmosphere.</p>
<p>Breadth of study was guaranteed by the &quot;pioneering&quot; four-year dual-honours degree programmes initially offered by Keele.  The cross-disciplinary requirement was reinforced by the Foundation Year, an innovation which meant that for the first year of the four-year programmes, all students would study a common course of <a>interdisciplinary</a> &quot;foundation studies&quot;. In the words of the first UCNS Prospectus, the programme offered:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Standard three-year degrees were introduced in 1973 and the numbers of students following the Foundation Year course have steadily dwindled since. The Foundation Year has never quite been formally discontinued, however, and remains an option for prospective students who qualify for entry into <a>Higher Education</a>, but lack subject-specific qualifications for specific degree programmes.  By contrast, the Dual Honours system at Keele remains distinctive and popular, with almost 90 per cent of current undergraduates reading dual honours. and it was required of the first professors appointed that they should also be in residence.  With the expansion of the University, total residency has long since been abandoned, but the proportion of students and staff resident on campus remains above average: 70 per cent of full-time students having been dubbed, in its early years, a &quot;School for Socialists&quot; and &quot;The Kremlin on the Hill&quot;. This left-wing radicalism largely faded over time, and symbolically ended in January 2008, when Keele became the last university in Britain to close its 'industrial relations' department.</p>
<p>Keele has a graduation rate of over 90%, Nine out of ten undergraduates are state-educated (a figure exceeded by only two traditional universities in England), and over 25% of students are from working-class backgrounds.</p>
<p>The QAA discontinued the &quot;graded profile&quot; method of individual subject review in 2001,  At that time, the highest-graded areas of teaching at Keele were: American studies, education, philosophy, politics and international relations (scoring 24 out of a possible 24); economics and psychology (scoring 23); maths and statistics, physics and astrophysics, organismal biosciences, sociology (scoring 22); and management, nursing and midwifery, biochemistry and biomedical sciences (scoring 21).</p>
<p>Research activities are co-ordinated by a Graduate School and organised within seven Research Institutes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research Institute for the Humanities</li>
  <li>Research Institute for Law, Politics and Justice</li>
  <li>Research Institute for Life Course Studies</li>
  <li>Research Institute for Public Policy and Management</li>
  <li>Research Institute for the Environment, Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics (EPSAM)</li>
  <li>Research Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine</li>
  <li>Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2005, an Office of Research and Enterprise has managed Keele's &quot;enterprise activities&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a>cochlear implant</a> was developed in the Department of Communication and Neuroscience at Keele. Other medical research undertaken at Keele includes detecting <a>Parkinson's disease</a> early, and utilizing <a>Stem cell</a> research to aid the healing process. Other notable medical research includes attempts to explain the evolution of the human brain, looking into links between <a>cannabis</a> and mental illness (research that was cited in the debate over the <a>2009 reclassification debate</a>), as well as <a>tumour</a> and <a>cancer</a> research.</p>
<p>Sociological research into <a>middle class</a> behaviour has also been noteworthy, especially findings that suggested that the 'law abiding majority' theory was a myth, and that middle class persons were more likely to commit crimes than commonly believed. Other research has been undertaken into the effectiveness of social work, including care for the elderly. Educational research has shown how music can help a child develop in school, and how health and safety had affected British children. Other research has shown how <a>e-mail</a>s have made communication more complex.</p>
<p>The University has also undertaken sports-related research projects, and has worked with the <a>Premier League</a> to develop technology for detecting <a>offside</a> players. Keele academics have also conducted research into how women perceived sport.</p>
<p>In August 2009, astronomers at the University, led by David Anderson, discovered the first planet that orbits in the opposite direction to the spin of its star. The planet was named <a>WASP-17b</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010 Richard Stephens, John Atkins, and Andrew Kingston won the <a>Ig Nobel prize</a> for confirming the widely held belief that swearing relieves pain.</p>
<p>In 2010 a medical centre in <a>Newport, Shropshire</a> was completed, for students to learn in real medical situations and research medical sciences.</p>
<h2>Sport</h2>
<p>Keele has a tradition of participation in many different sports, ranging from <a>rugby</a> to <a>lacrosse</a>, to <a>dodgeball</a>. Sports teams and issues raised are managed by the Athletic Union. The Leisure Centre is one of the largest dry leisure complexes in Staffordshire. The Centre boasts two national standard sports halls, a single court gymnasium, a fitness centre, dance studio and climbing wall. Outside there is an all weather floodlit <a>AstroTurf</a> pitch, tennis courts and extensive playing fields. It is also the first University Centre in the UK to offer a full &quot;Kinesis&quot; gym facility.</p>
<p>The Keele University Sports Centre plays host to the matches of <a>Newcastle (Staffs) Volleyball Club</a>, providing around 110 tiered seats with the perfect view of some of the best matches in English <a>Volleyball</a>. The University's sports centre has also played host to the &quot;Last 8s&quot; competition of the <a>Volleyball England</a> under 16 and under 18 cups in recent years, as well as the senior cup semi-finals.</p>
