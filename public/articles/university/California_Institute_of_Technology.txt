<p>The <strong>California Institute of Technology </strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Caltech</strong>)&lt;ref name=&quot;caltech&quot;&gt;The university itself only spells its short form as &quot;Caltech&quot;; other spellings such as <a>&quot;Cal Tech&quot; and &quot;CalTech&quot; are incorrect</a>. The Institute is also occasionally referred to as &quot;CIT&quot;, most notably in its alma mater, but this is uncommon.&lt;/ref&gt; is a <a>private</a> research university located in <a>Pasadena, California</a>, <a>United States</a>. Caltech has six academic divisions with a strong emphasis on science and engineering. Its 124 acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11&nbsp;mi (18&nbsp;km) northeast of <a>downtown</a> <a>Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<p>Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by <a>Amos G. Throop</a> in 1891, the eponymous college attracted influential scientists such as <a>George Ellery Hale</a>, <a>Arthur Amos Noyes</a>, and <a>Robert Andrews Millikan</a> in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, and the antecedents of <a>NASA</a>'s <a>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under <a>Theodore von Karman</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;aau&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech enrolls approximately 950 undergraduate and 1200 graduate students and employs about 300 professorial faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrollment&quot;/&gt; Despite its small size, 31 Caltech alumni and faculty have won the <a>Nobel Prize</a>, 67&nbsp;have won the <a>National Medal of Science</a> or <a>Technology</a>, and 110 have been elected to the <a>National Academies</a>. Caltech managed $357&nbsp;million in sponsored research and a $1.4&nbsp;billion endowment in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annual report&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>First year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus <a>house system</a>. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks,&lt;ref name=&quot;geek pranks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a>'s <a>Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Throop College</h3>
<p><a>thumb|290px|left|Throop Polytechnic Institute, Pasadena, Calif, 1908, on its original campus at downtown Pasadena.</a> Caltech began as a <a>vocational school</a> founded in Pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician <a>Amos G. Throop</a>. The school was known successively as <strong>Throop University</strong>, <strong>Throop Polytechnic Institute</strong>, and <strong>Throop College of Technology</strong>, before acquiring its current name in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;incorporation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>At a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy, <a>George Ellery Hale</a>, a solar astronomer from the <a>University of Chicago</a>, founded the <a>Mount Wilson Observatory</a> in 1904. He joined Throop's board of trustees the same year, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of <a>James A. B. Scherer</a>, a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W. Gates to donate $25,000 in seed money to build Gates Laboratory, the first science building on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates lab&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of the lab attracted <a>physical chemist</a> <a>Arthur Amos Noyes</a> to commit to developing the institution. Arther Fleming, Caltech's primary benefactor, who had donated the land for the permanent campus site at California and Wilson, later donated $100,000 to establish a physics facility, the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which succeeded in attracting experimental <a>physicist</a> <a>Robert Andrews Millikan</a> to join the <a>faculty</a> and assist in establishing the college as a center for <a>science</a> and <a>technology</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge lab&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>World Wars</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Throop Hall, 1912.</a> The vocational school was disbanded, and the preparatory program was split off into an independent <a>Polytechnic School</a> in 1910. In 1911, a bill was introduced in the <a>California Legislature</a> calling for the establishment of a publicly funded &quot;California Institute of Technology,&quot; with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of <a>Stanford</a> and the <a>University of California</a> successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the <a>World War II</a> necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dream Endures&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>With the onset of <a>World War I</a>, Hale organized the <a>National Research Council</a> to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in the <a>New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the National Research Council, Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for Throop to play a national role in science. The new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately lead to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which attracted Millikan from the University of Chicago. During the course of the war, Hale, Noyes and Millikan worked together in Washington on the NRC. Subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing Caltech.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Hale, Noyes and Millikan (aided by the booming economy of <a>Southern California</a>), Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s. In 1923, Millikan was awarded the <a>Nobel Prize</a> in <a>Physics</a>. In 1925, the school established a department of <a>geology</a> and hired <a>William Bennett Munro</a>, then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at <a>Harvard University</a>, to create a division of <a>humanities</a> and <a>social sciences</a> at Caltech. In 1928, a division of <a>biology</a> was established under the leadership of <a>Thomas Hunt Morgan</a>, the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the <a>chromosome</a> in heredity. In 1930, <a>Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory</a> was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor <a>George MacGinitie</a>. In 1926, a graduate school of <a>aeronautics</a> was created, which eventually attracted <a>Theodore von K&#x00e1;rm&#x00e1;n</a>. K&#x00e1;rm&#x00e1;n later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for <a>rocket science</a>. In 1928, construction of the <a>Palomar Observatory</a> began.</p>
<p>Millikan served as &quot;Chairman of the Executive Council&quot; (effectively Caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the Institute was occasionally referred to as &quot;Millikan's School.&quot; Millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining Caltech. Scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as <a>Paul Dirac</a>, <a>Erwin Schr&#x00f6;dinger</a>, <a>Werner Heisenberg</a>, <a>Hendrik Lorentz</a> and <a>Niels Bohr</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Albert Einstein</a> arrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1930 to polish up his <a>Theory of General Relativity</a>, and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1931 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Post-war growth</h3>
<p>In the 1950s-1970s, Caltech was the home of <a>Murray Gell-Mann</a> and <a>Richard Feynman</a>, whose work was central to the establishment of the <a>Standard Model</a> of particle physics. Feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful, unconventional character.</p>
<p>During <a>Lee A. DuBridge</a>'s tenure as Caltech's president (1946&#x2013;1969), Caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. DuBridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed <a>federal funding</a> of science. New research fields flourished, including <a>chemical biology</a>, <a>planetary science</a>, <a>nuclear astrophysics</a>, and <a>geochemistry</a>. A 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  </p>
<p>Caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of <a>Harold Brown</a> in 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The male:female ratio has been improving since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics that there has been only one organized student protest in January 1968 outside the Burbank studios of <a>NBC</a>, in response to rumors that NBC was to cancel <a>Star Trek</a>. In 1973, the students from <a>Dabney House</a> protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase &quot;Impeach Nixon&quot;. The following week, Ross McCollum, president of the <a>National Oil Company</a>, wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech. The Dabney family, being Republicans, disowned Dabney House after hearing of the prank.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>In fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for Caltech's undergraduate enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; In the same year, the Institute concluded a six-year long fund-raising campaign. The campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2010, Caltech, in partnership with <a>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, established a <a>DOE</a> Energy Innovation Hub aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight. This hub, the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, will receive up to $122 million in federal funding over five years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A <a>TEDx</a> was organised in 2011, called TEDxCaltech. The theme of the event was <em>Feynman's Vision: The Next 50 Years</em>. The speakers included Caltech faculty and students, as well as external professors and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Millikan Library, the tallest building on campus</a> Caltech's  primary campus is located in <a>Pasadena, California</a>, approximately  northeast of <a>downtown</a> <a>Los Angeles</a>. It is within walking distance of <a>Old Town Pasadena</a> and the <a>Pasadena Playhouse District</a> and therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for Caltech students.</p>
<p>In 1917 Hale hired architect <a>Bertram Goodhue</a> to produce a master plan for the  campus. Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, Dabney Hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and Hale's educational philosophy. Goodhue's designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional <a>Spanish mission architecture</a> of Southern California.</p>
<p>In 1971 a <a>magnitude-6.5 earthquake</a> in <a>San Fernando</a> caused some damage to the Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute&nbsp;&#x2014; Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium&nbsp;&#x2014; had cracked. These were some of the first <a>reinforced concrete</a> buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much <a>reinforcing bar</a> had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large <a>wrecking ball</a> was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.</p>
<p>New additions to the campus include the Cahill Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology, which opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also concluded an upgrading of the <a>south houses</a> in 2006. In late 2010, Caltech completed a 1.3 MW <a>solar array</a> projected to produce approximately 1.6 GWh in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|Bridge Laboratory of Physics</a>Caltech is incorporated as a non-profit corporation and is governed by a privately appointed 46-member <a>board of trustees</a> who serve five year terms of office and retire at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=&quot;incorporation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bylaws&quot;/&gt; <a>The current board</a> is chaired by <a>Kent Kresa</a>, former chairman and CEO of <a>Northrup Grumman</a> and former chairman of <a>General Motors</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Trustees elect a President to serve as the chief executive officer of the Institute and administer the affairs on the Institute on behalf of the board, a Provost who serves as the chief academic officer of the Institute below the President, and ten other vice presidential and other senior positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bylaws&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Former <a>Georgia Tech</a> provost <a>Jean-Lou Chameau</a> became the eighth president of Caltech on September 1, 2006, replacing <a>David Baltimore</a> who had served since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Chameau's compensation for 2008&#x2013;2009 totaled $765,260.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Edward M. Stolper</a> is the Institute's ninth provost and is responsible for academic budget, faculty appointments and promotions, and coordinates curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech's $1.4&nbsp;billion endowment is governed by a permanent Trustee committee and administered by an Investment Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The Institute is organized into six primary academic divisions: Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Engineering and Applied Science, Geological and Planetary Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy. The voting faculty of Caltech include all professors, instructors, research associates and fellows, and librarians. Faculty are responsible for establishing admission requirements, academic standards, and curricula. The Faculty Board is the faculty's representative body and consists of 18 elected faculty representatives as well as other senior administration officials. Full-time professors are expected to teach classes, conduct research, advise students, and perform administrative work such as serving on committees.&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty handbook&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) is a <a>federally funded research and development center</a> (FFRDC) owned by <a>NASA</a> and operated as a division of Caltech thorough a contract between NASA and Caltech. In 2008, JPL spend over $1.6&nbsp;billion on research and development and employed over 5,000 project-related and support employees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The JPL Director also serves as a Caltech Vice President and is responsible to the President of the Institute for the management of the Laboratory.&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Caltech is a small four-year, highly residential research university with a slight majority in graduate programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute has been accredited by the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a> since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech is on the <a>quarter system</a>:&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt; the fall term starts in late September and ends before Christmas, the second term starts after New Years Day and ends in mid-March, and the third term starts in late March or early April and ends in early June.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech was ranked 2nd internationally in 2010 by the <em><a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a></em>, just behind <a>Harvard University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech was ranked as the best university in the world within the Engineering and Technology Universities category&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and second best within the Physical Sciences Universities category.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found to have the highest faculty citation rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#x2019;s <em><a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a></em>, a ranking with an emphasis on bibliometric data and scientific research, ranked Caltech 6th in the world and 5th in the U.S. for 2010. Caltech was found to have the highest score for per-capita performance in that ranking.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> also ranked Caltech as the 7th best university in the United States in their 2011 national college rankings, together with <a>MIT</a>. According to the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report's</em> Best Graduate Schools 2011 ranking, &quot;California Institute of Technology headlines the new rankings, with top billing in three categories: chemistry, earth sciences and physics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>United States National Research Council</a> released its latest <em>Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs</em> in 2010, and 23 of the 24 graduate programs of Caltech were ranked within the top four programs in the nation in their size quartile as determined by both the R95 and S95 rankings. Of particular note, programs that were placed within the top 10% of all size programs in that field based on an average of the R95 and S95 rank order include Aeronautics, Astrophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geology, Geophysics, Materials Science, Physics, Planetary Science, and Social Science (Economics).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Undergraduate program</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Kerckhoff Laboratory of the Biological Sciences</a>The full time, four year undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;/&gt; Caltech offers 24 majors (called &quot;options&quot;) and six minors across all six academic divisions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in Applied Physics, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Computation and Neural Systems, Control and Dynamical Systems, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geobiology and Astrobiology, Geochemistry, and Planetary Astronomy. The most popular options are Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office of the Registrar Newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of 30 classes: five terms of mathematics, five terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, a freshman elective &quot;menu&quot; course, two terms of introductory lab courses, two terms of science writing, and twelve terms of humanities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fah&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20 percent of students double-major.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. Although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged, it is still possible.</p>
<p>First year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math, physics, chemistry, and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a Pass/Fail basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;fah&quot;/&gt; There is little competition; collaboration on <a>homework</a> is encouraged and the Honor System encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech offers co-operative programs with other schools, such as the Pasadena <a>Art Center College of Design</a> and <a>Occidental College</a>.</p>
<p>Undergraduate tuition for the 2010&#x2013;2011 school year was $34,989 and total annual costs were estimated to be $52,389.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007&#x2013;2008, Caltech awarded $12.9 million in need-based aid, $2.73 million in non-need-based aid, and $1.50 million in self-help support to every enrolled undergraduate student. The average financial aid package of all students was $31,611 and students graduated with an average debt of $9,871.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Caltech alumni have the highest median starting salary among graduates of other colleges or universities in 2010-2011, of $69,900, according to <a>PayScale</a>. The mid-career median pay is $120,000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech offers Army and Air Force <a>ROTC</a> in cooperation with the <a>University of Southern California</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Graduate program</h3>
<p>The graduate instructional programs emphasize doctoral studies and are dominated by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;/&gt; The Institute offers graduate degree programs for the Master of Science, Engineer's Degree, Doctor of Philosophy, BS/MS and MD/PhD, with the majority of students in the PhD program.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;/&gt; The most popular options are Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office of the Registrar Newsletter&quot;/&gt; Applicants for graduate studies are required to take the <a>GRE</a>. GRE Subject scores are either required or strongly recommended.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The research facilities at Caltech are available to graduate students, but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities, research centers as well as private industries.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The graduate student to faculty ratio is 4:1.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Approximately 99% of doctoral students have full financial support. Financial support for graduate students comes in the form of fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships or a combination of fellowship and assistantship support.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Graduate students are bound by the Honor Code, as do the undergraduates, and the Graduate Review Board oversees any violations of the code.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>Caltech was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1934 and remains a research university with &quot;very high&quot; research activity, primarily in <a>STEM fields</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;aau&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;/&gt; Caltech manages research expenditures of $270 million annually,&lt;ref&gt;Funding for Caltech does not include NASA's funding for JPL.&lt;/ref&gt; 66th among all universities in the U.S. and 17th among private institutions without medical schools for 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf expenditures&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The largest federal agencies contributing to research are <a>NASA</a>, <a>National Science Foundation</a>, <a>Department of Health and Human Services</a>, <a>Department of Defense</a>, and <a>Department of Energy</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech received $144 million in federal funding for the physical sciences, $40.8 million for the life sciences, $33.5 million for engineering, $14.4 million for environmental sciences, $7.16 million for computer sciences, and $1.97 million for mathematical sciences in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was awarded an all-time high funding of $357 million in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;annual report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Active funding from the <a>National Science Foundation</a> Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Science (MPS) for Caltech stands at $293 million as of 2010, the highest for any educational institution in the nation, and higher than the total funds allocated to any state except California and New York.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2005, Caltech had  dedicated to research:  to physical sciences,  to engineering, and  to biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In addition to managing JPL, Caltech also operates the <a>Palomar Observatory</a> in <a>San Diego County</a>, the <a>Owens Valley Radio Observatory</a> in <a>Bishop, California</a>, the <a>Submillimeter Observatory</a> and <a>W. M.

The Spitzer Science Center (SSC), part of the <a>Infrared Processing and Analysis Center</a> located on the Caltech campus, is the data analysis and community support center for <a>NASA</a>'s <a>Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at Caltech are also encouraged to participate in <a>research</a>. About half of students do research through the annual <a>Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)</a> program at least once during their stay, and many continue it during the school year. Students write and submit SURF proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors, and about 70 percent of applicants are awarded SURFs. The program is open to both Caltech and non-Caltech undergraduate students. It serves as preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why Caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a PhD of all the major universities.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Baccalaureate Origins of S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The licensing and transferring of technology to the commercial sector is managed by the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT). OTT protects and manages the intellectual property developed by faculty members, students, other researchers, and JPL technologists. Caltech receives more invention disclosures per faculty member than any other university in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Caltech Office of Technology Transfer</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>House system</h3>
<p></p>
<p>During the early 20th century, a Caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the undergraduate housing system from regular <a>fraternities</a> to a <a>house system</a>. Four south houses (or <em>hovses</em>) were built: <a>Blacker House</a>, <a>Dabney House</a>, <a>Fleming House</a> and <a>Ricketts House</a>. In the 1960s, three north houses were built: <a>Lloyd House</a>, <a>Page House</a>, and <a>Ruddock House</a>, and during the 1990s, <a>Avery House</a>. The four south houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006. All first year students live in the house system and 95% of undergraduates remain in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Caltech has athletic teams in baseball, men's and women's basketball, cross country, fencing, men's soccer, swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, track and field, women's volleyball, and men's and women's water polo.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Caltech Athletics</a>. Retrieved 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech's mascot is the Beaver, and its teams (with the exception of the fencing team) play in the <a>Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a>, which Caltech co-founded in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a>. Retrieved 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The fencing team&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; competes in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a>, facing teams from <a>USC</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>UCSD</a>, and <a>Stanford</a>, among others. <a>thumb|left|The Caltech Beavers</a></p>
<p>On January 6, 2007, the Beavers' men's basketball team snapped a 207-game losing streak to Division III schools, beating <a>Bard College</a> 81-52. It was their first Division III victory since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>However, the team has not won a game in <a>conference</a> play since 1985, a losing string that as of December 2010 had extended to 297 games.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The <a>documentary film</a> <em><a>Quantum Hoops</a></em> concerns the events of the Beavers' 2005-6 season.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2007, the Caltech women's basketball team snapped a 50-game losing streak, defeating the <a>Pomona-Pitzer</a> Sagehens 55-53. The women's program, which entered the <a>SCIAC</a> in 2002, garnered their first conference win. On the bench as honorary coach for the evening was <a>Dr. Robert Grubbs</a>, 2005 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The team went on to beat Whittier College on February 10, for its second SCIAC win, and placed its first member on the All Conference team.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006-2007 season is the most successful season in the history of the program.</pre>
<p>On March 5, 2009, the Soccer team snapped a 201-game losing streak to Pomona-Pitzer 1-0.</p>
<p>In 2007, 2008, and 2009, the women's table tennis team (a club team) competed in nationals. The women's <a>Ultimate</a> club team, known as &quot;Snatch&quot;, has also been very successful in recent years, ranking 44 of over 200 college teams in the Ultimate Player's Association.&lt;ref&gt;<a>College Women's Top UPA Rankings</a>, Ultimate Player's Association.

<h3>Student life traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Beckman Auditorium</a></p>
<h4>Annual events</h4>
<p>Every <a>Halloween</a>, Dabney House conducts the infamous &quot;Millikan pumpkin-drop experiment&quot; from the top of Millikan Library, the highest point on campus. According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in <a>liquid nitrogen</a> and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a <a>triboluminescent</a> spark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous <a>Millikan oil-drop experiment</a> which measured <em>e</em>, the <a>elemental unit of electrical charge</a>.</p>
<p>On <a>Ditch Day</a>, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a &quot;stack&quot; to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year. In 2010, Ditch Day fell on May 21.</p>
<p>Another long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's ominous <em><a>Ride of the Valkyries</a></em> at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire fifteen hours of <em><a>The Ring Cycle</a></em>), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the <em>Ride</em> is such a strong tradition that the music was used during <a>Apollo 17</a> to awaken Astronaut <a>Harrison Schmitt</a>, a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.</p>
<h4>Pranks</h4>
<p><a>thumb|Fleming Cannon</a></p>
<p>Caltech students have been known for the many <a>prank</a>s (also known as <strong><a>RF</a>s</strong>).</p>
<p>The two most famous in recent history are the changing of the <a>Hollywood Sign</a> to read &quot;Caltech&quot;, by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the <a>Rose Bowl</a> scoreboard to an imaginary game where Caltech beat <a>MIT</a> 99-0. But the most famous of all occurred during the <a>1961 Rose Bowl Game</a>, where Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display &quot;Caltech&quot;, and several other &quot;unintended&quot; messages.  This event is now referred to as the <a>Great Rose Bowl Hoax</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students. These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&quot; engraving on the main building fa&#x00e7;ade with a banner so that it read &quot;That Other Institute of Technology&quot;. A group of <a>MIT hackers</a> responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read &quot;The Only Institute of Technology.&quot; Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class, with MIT on the front and &quot;... because not everyone can go to Caltech&quot; along with an image of a palm tree on the back.</p>
<p>MIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe &amp; Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby <a>Harvey Mudd College</a> in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.</p>
<p>On April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from <em>The California Tech</em>, Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed <a>fake copies</a> of <em>The Tech</em>, MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included &quot;MIT Invents the Interweb,&quot; &quot;Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate',&quot; and &quot;Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life. &quot;The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back,&quot; reported the Boston Globe, which noted that &quot;security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Caltech pranks have been documented in three <a>Legends of Caltech</a> books, the most recent of which was edited by alumni Autumn Looijen '99 and Mason A. Porter '98 and published in May 2007.</p>
<p>In December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A &quot;sold&quot; banner was hung on front of the MIT humanities building and a &quot;Caltech East&quot; banner inside.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus</a>, December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades</a>, <em>Pasadena Star-News</em>, December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Honor Code</h4>
<p><a>thumb|Throop Pond</a></p>
<p>Life in the Caltech community is governed by the <a>Honor Code</a>, which simply states: &quot;No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.&quot; This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Review Board.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Honor Code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the Honor Code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.</p>
<p>Through the late 1990s, the only exception to the Honor Code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the Honor Code in the form of new institute policies such as the Fire Policy, and Alcohol Policy. Though both policies are presented in the Honor Code Handbook given to new members of the Caltech Community, large portions of the undergraduate population regard them as a slight against the Honor Code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<h2>In media and popular culture</h2>
<p>&lt;!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie Caltech is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't insert it.--&gt; Caltech has appeared in several works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. <a>As with MIT</a>, a Caltech reference is often used to establish a character's high level of intelligence or a technical background. For example, on television, the four male lead characters of the sitcom <em><a>The Big Bang Theory</a></em> are all employed at the Institute. Caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, for the California Institute of Science of <em><a>Numb3rs</a></em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;realgenius&quot;&gt;<a>Caltech References in &quot;Real Genius&quot;</a>.

<h2>People</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As of 2010, Caltech has 31 <a>Nobel laureates</a> to its name. This figure includes 17 alumni, 14 non-alumni professors, and 4 professors who are also alumni (<a>Carl D. Anderson</a>, <a>Linus Pauling</a>, <a>William A. Fowler</a>, and <a>Edward B. Lewis</a>). The number of awards is 32, because Pauling received prizes in both <a>Chemistry</a> and <a>Peace</a>. With fewer than 25,000 alumni in total, more than one in 1,400 have received the Nobel Prize&nbsp;&#x2014; a ratio unmatched by any other university. 6 faculty and alumni have received a <a>Crafoord Prize</a> from the <a>Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>, while 55 have been awarded the U.S. <a>National Medal of Science</a>, and 12 have received the <a>National Medal of Technology</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One alumnus, <a>Stanislav Smirnov</a>, won the <a>Fields Medal</a> in 2010. Other distinguished researchers have been affiliated with Caltech as postdoctoral scholars (e.g., <a>Barbara McClintock</a>, <a>James D. Watson</a> and <a>Sheldon Glashow</a>) or visiting professors (e.g., <a>Albert Einstein</a>, <a>Stephen Hawking</a> and <a>Edward Witten</a>).</p>

Women made up 40% of the undergraduate and 29% of the graduate student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; 66% of non-international freshmen are from out of state. Caltech received 4,859 applications for the class of 2014: 610 were admitted (12.6%) and 222 of them enrolled. The <a>interquartile range</a> for first year students' <a>SAT</a> scores was 2200 to 2330. 98% of students were ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The four-year graduation rate is 80.6% and the six-year rate is 88%,&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;  which is low compared to most leading U.S. universities,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but substantially higher than it was in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Students majoring in <a>STEM fields</a> traditionally have graduation rates below 70%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Faculty and staff</h3>
<p><a>Richard Feynman</a> was perhaps the most well-known faculty to be associated with Caltech, having published the <em><a>Feynman Lectures on Physics</a></em>, an undergraduate physics text, and a few other popular science texts such as <em><a>Six Easy Pieces</a></em> for the general audience. The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in <a>quantum electrodynamics</a> was already very established in the scientific community. <a>Murray Gell-Mann</a>, a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of <a>hadrons</a> and went on to postulate the existence of <a>quarks</a>, which is currently accepted as part of the <a>Standard Model</a>. <a>Linus Pauling</a> pioneered <a>quantum chemistry</a>  and <a>molecular biology</a>,  and he went on to solve for the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. In engineering, <a>Theodore von K&#x00e1;rm&#x00e1;n</a> made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on <a>supersonic</a> and <a>hypersonic</a> airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling <a>vortices</a> is named after him, the <a>von K&#x00e1;rm&#x00e1;n vortex street</a>. More recently, <a>Michael Brown</a>, a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many <a>trans-Neptunian object</a>s, most notably the <a>dwarf planet</a> <a>Eris</a>, which prompted the <a>International Astronomical Union</a> to redefine the term &quot;<a>planet</a>&quot;.</p>
<p><a>David Baltimore</a>, the Robert A. Millikan Professor of Biology, and <a>Alice Huang</a>, Senior Faculty Associate in Biology, served as the President of <a>AAAS</a> from 2007&#x2013;2008 and 2010-2011 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Thirty-three percent of the faculty are members of the <a>National Academy of Science</a> or <a>Engineering</a> and/or fellows of the <a>American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. This is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution <a>Rockefeller University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The average salary for assistant professors at Caltech is $105,800, associate professors $126,000, and full professors $171,900.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech faculty are highly productive in the fields of biology, biochemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, applied physics, astronomy and astrophysics, computer science, geology, and physics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Alumni</h3>
<p>Seventeen alumni and 14 non-alumni faculty have won the <a>Nobel Prize</a>.  The <a>Turing Award</a>, the &quot;Nobel Prize of Computer Science&quot;, has been awarded to six alumni, and one has won the <a>Fields Medal</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;science_now&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Alumni have participated in scientific research. Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules. <a>Nobel laureate</a> <a>Carl D. Anderson</a> (BS 1927, PhD 1930) proved the existence of <a>positron</a>s and <a>muon</a>s,  Nobel laureate <a>Edwin McMillan</a>  (BS 1928, MS 1929) synthesized the first <a>transuranium element</a>, Nobel laureate <a>Leo James Rainwater</a> (BS 1939) investigated the non-spherical shapes of atomic nuclei, and Nobel laureate <a>Douglas D. Osheroff</a> (BS 1967) studied the <a>superfluid</a> nature of <a>helium-3</a>.</p>
<p>Other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe. <a>C. Gordon Fullerton</a> (BS 1957, MS 1958) piloted the third <a>space shuttle</a> mission and orbited the earth in <a>Skylab</a>.  Astronaut (and later, <a>United States Senator</a>) <a>Harrison Schmitt</a> (BS 1957) was the only <a>geologist</a> to have ever walked on the surface of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer <a>Eugene Merle Shoemaker</a> (BS 1947, MS 1948) co-discovered <a>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> (a comet which crashed into the planet <a>Jupiter</a>) and was the first person buried on the moon (by having his ashes crashed into the moon).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1998, Celestis, at the request of NASA, provided a Luna Flight Capsule to the family and friends of the late legendary astronomer and planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker. The Celestis Flight Capsule, containing a symbolic portion of Shoemaker's cremated remains, was attached to NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft and launched on a one-year mission orbiting the moon. On July 31, 1999, at the completion of Lunar Prospector's mission, the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into the moon's south pole, making Shoemaker the first human to be laid to rest on another celestial body. NASA called the memorial &quot;a special honor for a special human being.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Undergraduate alumni founded, or co-founded, companies such as <a>LCD</a> manufacturer Varitronix,&lt;ref&gt;<a>York Liao</a> (BS 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Hotmail</a>,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Sabeer Bhatia</a>, BS 1991&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Compaq</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Rosen, BS 1954&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>MathWorks</a>  (which created <a>Matlab</a>),&lt;ref&gt;<a>Cleve Moler</a>, BS 1961 &lt;/ref&gt; while graduate students founded, or co-founded,  companies such as <a>Intel</a>,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Gordon Moore</a>, PhD 1954&lt;/ref&gt; <a>TRW</a>,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Simon Ramo</a>, PhD 1936 &lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>Exploratorium</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Frank Oppenheimer</a>, PhD 1939 &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Arnold Beckman</a> (PhD 1928) invented the <a>pH meter</a> and commecialized it with the founding of <a>Beckman Instruments</a>.  His success with that company enabled him to provide seed funding for <a>William Shockley</a> (BS 1932), who had co-invented <a>semiconductor</a> <a>transistor</a>s and wanted to commercialize them. Because his aging mother was living in <a>Palo Alto, California</a> at the time, Shockley decided to establish his laboratory near her&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955, in neighboring <a>Mountain View, California</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shockley_byNobelPrizeFoundation1956&quot;/&gt; and thus, Shockley became the founding Director of the <a>Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory</a> division of Beckman Instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shockley_byNobelPrizeFoundation1956&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shockely  was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956, but his aggressive management style and odd personality&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How he was miserable is more complicated than even I could get into a hundred thousand word book. There was something wrong with him. What was wrong with him, we don't really know. He was at best paranoid. He was probably obsessive-compulsive. The manuscript of the book has been shown to about six or seven psychotherapist, and I asked them for a diagnosis, and they came back with six or seven different diagnoses.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; at the Shockley Lab became unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Shockley, whose role as coinventor of the transistor would win him a share of the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics, succeeded in luring a diverse group of accomplished scientists, including Moore, to the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, in Palo Alto, California. He then proceeded to antagonize and alienate enough of them to inspire an exodus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1957, eight of his researchers, known now as the &quot;<a>Traitorous Eight</a>&quot; (or &quot;<a>Fairchildren</a>&quot;), resigned and joined <a>Fairchild Camera and Instruments</a> nearby to form a semiconductor division. Among the &quot;Traitorous Eight&quot; was <a>Gordon E. Moore</a> (PhD 1954), who left Fairchild to co-found <a>Intel</a>. Other offspring companies of Fairchild Semicondutor include <a>National Semiconductor</a> and <a>Advanced Micro Devices</a>, which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area.  Shockley's decision to use <a>silicon</a> -- instead of <a>germanium</a> -- as the <a>semiconductor</a> material, coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area, gave rise to the term &quot;<a>Silicon Valley</a>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Joel Shurnkin: ...He decided he was going to be the first entrepreneur of the electronic age, and indeed he was. With backing from a man named <a>Arnold Beckman</a>, he founded Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto and he was going to build - at least at first he was going to build silicon transistors. It was his decision that they use <a>silicon</a> as opposed to <a>germanium</a>, otherwise we'd be talking about Germanium Valley out there instead of Silicon Valley. (Soundbite of laughter) &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; to describe that geographic region surrounding Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Caltech alumni also held public offices, with <a>James Fletcher</a> (PhD 1948) being the 4th and 7th <a>Administrator of NASA</a>, <a>Steven Koonin</a> (PhD 1972) being the <a>Undersecretary of Energy for Science</a> and <a>Regina Dugan</a> (PhD 1993) being the director of <a>DARPA</a>.</p>
