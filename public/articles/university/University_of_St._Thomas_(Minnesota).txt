<p>The <strong>University of St. Thomas</strong> (also known as <strong>UST</strong> or simply <strong>St. Thomas</strong>) is a <a>private</a>, <a>Catholic</a>, <a>coeducational</a>, <a>liberal arts</a>, and <a>archdiocesan</a> university based in <a>St. Paul</a> and <a>Minneapolis</a>, <a>Minnesota</a>. Founded in 1885 as a Catholic <a>seminary</a>, it is named after <a>St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, a medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of learners in the Roman Catholic Church. UST currently enrolls more than 10,000 students, making it Minnesota's largest private college or university.  <a>Father Dennis Dease</a> became the 14th president in the history of the University in 1991.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1885 by <a>John Ireland</a>, <a>archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis</a>, St. Thomas began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. In 1894, it became a <a>liberal arts college</a> through a gift from local railroad tycoon <a>James J. Hill</a>, who provided funds to establish the St. Paul Seminary apart from the college. In 1903, the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus, and it was officially termed a military school by the <a>U.S. War Department</a> in 1906. Initially, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915. In 1922, military training became optional.</p>
<p>From the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the <a>Holy Cross Fathers</a>, who run the <a>University of Notre Dame</a>, controlled the college's administration. The <a>diocese</a> called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During <a>World War II</a>, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established &quot;Tom Town&quot; on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently the site to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library and O'Shaughnessey Education Center. Tom Town, made of 20 double-dwelling huts, consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after WWII.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the 20th century, St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs: Education in 1950 and Business Administration in 1974. The school became co-educational in 1977 and although women were not allowed to enroll until then, female students from <a>St. Catherine University</a> often took classes at St. Thomas. Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus but the staff, faculty, and administration has seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co-education. In 1991, the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year, the university opened the Minneapolis campus. In 2001, UST reinstated its <a>School of Law</a> at its Minneapolis Campus, it had been shut down during the Depression. <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> Justice <a>Antonin Scalia</a> was the speaker at the Grand Opening.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Saint Paul</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Arched entryway to the St. Paul campus</a> The St. Paul campus is home to most undergraduate students. The main campus, built on a farm site once considered &quot;far removed from town,&quot; is located where St. Paul's <a>Summit Avenue</a> meets the <a>Mississippi River</a>. The site was farmed by ex-<a>Fort Snelling</a> soldier William Finn, who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty.</p>
<p>The western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park. Summit Avenue, which runs through the middle of the campus, is the country's longest span of <a>Victorian</a> homes. This tree-lined avenue includes the Governor's Mansion, <a>F. Scott Fitzgerald's</a> townhome, and <a>James J. Hill's</a> mansion.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Murray-Herrick Center</a></p>
<p>UST is currently in the middle of expanding the St. Paul campus. In 2005 a new apartment-style <a>residence hall</a> was built on an existing parking lot, and in 2006 McNeely Hall was built&mdash;a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name. A new residential village, more <a>parking ramp</a>s, and general civil engineering all have been negotiated successfully with the surrounding neighborhood. These developments are expected to begin within the next five years.</p>
<p>In addition, the designing of a new <a>student center</a> is currently in the works. The new student center is slated to be placed on an existing parking lot, hold underground parking, and be large enough to contain a new cafeteria, a ballroom, offices, a gathering area, and other facilities that are currently unavailable or inefficient.</p>
<h3>Minneapolis</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|Downtown Minneapolis Campus</a> In fall 1992, the university opened a permanent, 150,000 square foot (14,000 m&#x00b2;) campus at 1000 LaSalle Ave. in <a>Minneapolis</a>. The first building, named Terrence Murphy Hall in May 2000, is headquarters to the university's <a>Opus College of Business</a>. Artist Mark Balma created one of the largest <a>fresco</a>es in the United States on the arched ceiling of its atrium. The seven-panel, 1,904 square foot (177 m&#x00b2;) fresco was completed in the summer of 1994 and portrays the <a>seven virtues</a> discussed in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. The Minneapolis campus also holds St. Thomas' School of Education, the nationally recognized <a>School of Law</a>, and Schulze School of Entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Gainey Conference Center (Owatonna)</h3>
<p>Built in 1981, the Gainey Conference Center is a full-service conference and retreat facility located on 180 acres (~728,000 m&#x00b2;) in <a>Owatonna</a>, Minnesota, just one hour south of the <a>Twin Cities</a>. It was built around the French Norman-style home of the late Daniel C. Gainey, who bequeathed the property to the university upon his death in 1979.</p>
<h3>Bernardi (Rome)</h3>
<p>The University of St. Thomas Bernardi Campus is located on the west bank of the <a>Tiber River</a> on Lungotevere delle Armi in <a>Rome, Italy</a>. Purchased by St. Thomas in November 1999, the Bernardi Campus houses St. Thomas students participating in academic programs abroad, most notably the Catholic Studies Semester in Rome program for Catholic Studies majors, minors, and graduate students offered through the Catholic Studies Department. The University of St. Thomas is the only university in the United States to have a formal affiliation with the <a>Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, called the &quot;<a>Angelicum</a>&quot;.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[File:Tommie Johnnie Football.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Tommie/[[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Johnnie]] Football in 2005]] St. Thomas's school colors are purple and gray, and the athletic teams are called the Tommies. The mascot for these teams is &quot;Tommie&quot; the <a>tomcat</a>. The name Tommy was changed to Tommie with an 'ie' when girls were accepted as full time students to be more inclusive of the women. UST is a member of the <a>Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (MIAC), which performs at the <a>NCAA Division III</a> level. Since 1885 athletics have been present on St. Thomas' campus. The first sports teams that became popular were <a>intramural</a>. The top intramural baseball teams in the 1890s were the &quot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Grays&quot;, which is where the Tommies' school colors come from. Varsity sports did not begin until 1904. UST celebrated its 100th year of varsity athletics in 2003-2004.</p>
<p>UST's longtime archrival is <a>Saint John's University</a> from <a>Collegeville, Minnesota</a>. St. Thomas leads the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in NCAA Division III Team Championships won with 10. Recent national wins include men's baseball in 2009 and 2001, women's softball in 2004 and 2005, and men's lacrosse in 2009. St. Thomas also won national championships with women's basketball in 1991, men's cross country in 1984 and 1986, men's indoor track in 1985, and women's cross country in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987.

<h3>Men's Lacrosse</h3>
<p>The highly successful University of St. Thomas men's lacrosse program competes at the Division II level of the <a>Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association</a> (MCLA).  St. Thomas won back-to-back MCLA DII National Championships in 2010 and 2009 (defeating <a>Utah Valley University</a> and <a>University of Dayton</a>, respectively).  In addition to winning National championships in 2010 and 2009, the team also made appearances in the MCLA National Tournament in 2008, 2007 and 2006.  As is the Tommie tradition, the lacrosse team's arch-rivals are the Johnnies of <a>St. John's University</a>.  Many UST students enjoy watching the highly competitive lacrosse action each spring in tradition-filled O'Shaughnessy Stadium.  In 2010, the lacrosse program celebrated its 25th anniversary with a ceremony honoring the group of student-athletes who started the program back in 1985.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p><a>thumb|225px|right|Cretin Hall, built in 1894</a> Undergraduate housing is found on the St. Paul Campus. Approximately 2,400 residents live in 10 traditional halls and apartments. Additionally there is an undergraduate residence for St. John Vianney Seminary students.  All traditional halls are single-sex, while apartment residences are co-ed by floor. Residence halls on campus are named after <a>Archbishops of Minneapolis-St. Paul</a>, such as <a>William O. Brady</a>, <a>Austin Dowling</a>, and <a>John Ireland</a>. The all-female traditional hall of John Paul II is named after the former Pope. Built in 1894, <a>Cretin Hall</a> is the oldest hall on campus and was designed (along with Loras and Grace halls) by <a>Cass Gilbert</a>. </p>
<p>Recently the department of residence life has purchased additional buildings on what they are calling 'mid-campus' in the area of land between Grand and Summit Avenues. They are housing men and women transfer students in one of two buildings, separated by gender. There is an apartment complex that is specifically designed for sophomores. Also, they house students in the residence above the Child Development Center, which is a day-care facility on campus.</p>
<p>[[File:Morrison Hall (Minnesota).JPG|thumb|left|225px|Morrison Hall is connected to Koch Commons with a [[skyway]]]] The University of St. Thomas offers special interest floors, or floors that are intended to house specific residents with similar interests or class standing. Almost one-third of all floors are First Year Experience floors, which consist of only <a>freshmen</a>. This practice attempts to create a cohesive community by placing students together that will have a similar experience. UST has also had a Catholic Women's floor, Catholic Men's floor, the Changing Faces of Minnesota floors, the Women in Math &amp; Science floor, Substance Free floors, and will open their first Sophomore Experience floors in the fall of 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Housing Policies</strong>&lt;br /&gt; Most of the dorms have strict policies regarding guests within the residence hall.  After 8 PM any guests (including students of other dorms) must be checked in by a member of that residence.  Guests must leave the dorm by midnight on weekdays and 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights.  As of the 2008/2009 school year, St. Thomas has initiated a check-out rule where guests must check out, otherwise the resident may face penalties or fines.  The policies are largely in effect to instill Catholic values and keep members of the opposite gender from staying overnight in the same room, but the guest visitation policy also serves to help ensure campus safety.  The campus is not dry: students over 21 years of age are allowed alcohol in the upper-class apartments.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Student Government</h3>
<p>The on-campus student association is the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), formerly known as the ACC. The student government is made up of an executive board and general council. Each executive board member receives a stipend. The executive board consists of the president of the student body, executive vice president, vice president of financial affairs, vice president of academic affairs, vice president of administrative affairs and vice president of public relations. The general council consists of class presidents, class senators and representatives from various university organizations. </p>
<p>The student government oversees funding to all clubs on campus, approves new club requests, appoints students to various university committees and represents the student body to the administration. USG has its own offices located in the student center. Elections are held in the fall and spring every academic year.</p>
