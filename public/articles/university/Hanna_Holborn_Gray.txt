<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Gray was born in <a>Heidelberg, Germany</a>, the daughter of <a>Hajo Holborn</a>, a professor of European history who fled to America from <a>Nazi Germany</a>, and <a>Annemarie Bettmann</a>, a philologist. She graduated from <a>Bryn Mawr College</a> and traveled to <a>Oxford</a> as a <a>Fulbright Scholar</a>. She met and married <a>Charles Montgomery Gray</a> in 1954 while both were graduate students at <a>Harvard University</a>, earned a <a>Ph.D.</a> from Harvard in 1957, and taught there, becoming an assistant professor in 1959.</p>
<p>She moved to <a>Chicago</a> when her husband obtained a position at the <a>University of Chicago</a> and she herself obtained a position there, becoming a tenured faculty member in 1964.  From 1966-1970, she served as a co-editor of the <a>Journal of Modern History</a> with her husband Charles.</p>
<p>Gray rose to prominence as an administrator when she was appointed to a committee to investigate whether a sociology professor had been denied tenure because of her gender and political sympathies.</p>
<p>She was named Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at <a>Northwestern University</a> in 1972, and became professor of history at, and Provost of, <a>Yale University</a> in 1974.  She served as acting President of Yale University for fourteen months after President Kingman Brewster accepted an unanticipated appointment as <a>United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James</a>.</p>
<p>Gray then returned to the <a>University of Chicago</a>, serving as president from 1978 to 1993, and, in that capacity, was the first female (full) president of a major university in the United States.</p>
<p>She retired in June 1993, but remains Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor Emerita and continues to offer advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in history. </p>
<p>She has also served as a Director, Board Member or Trustee of various institutions, including the <a>Harvard Corporation</a>, the <a>Yale Corporation</a>, the <a>Smithsonian Institution</a>, <a>JP Morgan Chase</a>, the <a>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, the <a>Marlboro School of Music</a>, the <a>Council on Foreign Relations</a>, the <a>Concord Coalition</a>, the <a>Mayo Clinic</a>, the <a>Brookings Institution</a>, and <a>Bryn Mawr</a>.</p>
<p>She is a recipient of over 60 honorary degrees, from schools such as the <a>University of Chicago</a>, <a>The College of William and Mary</a>, <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Oxford</a>, <a>Yale University</a>, <a>Brown</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, and <a>Duke</a>.</p>
<p>Gray served as Chairman of the Board of the second largest foundation in America, the <a>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> until 2010.</p>
