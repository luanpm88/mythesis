<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The University of Brighton is organised into six faculties, within which there are several schools, departments, institutes and research centres. The University Centre Hastings is also part of the university.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Arts</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Grand Parade Building, home of the Faculty of Arts</a></p>
<p>The <a>Faculty of Arts (University of Brighton)</a> is the oldest faculty of the university, its history can traced back to 1859 when the original Brighton School of Art opened its doors. In 2009 it took its new name, replacing the former &quot;Faculty of Arts &amp; Architecture&quot;. Subject areas offer study in arts, design and humanities, from short courses, undergraduate level, taught postgraduate and research degrees, MPhil and PhD. Located in the centre of Brighton, the Faculty provides a unique environment in which to study. The Faculty&#x2019;s <a>Centre for Research and Development (CRD)</a> supports research of international significance and resulted in Sixty-five per cent of research in art and design being classified as either 'world leading' or 'internationally excellent'in the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> RAE2008. Its research arm, the Centre for Research and Development, was awarded a grade of 5 out of a possible 5 in the recently concluded <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE 2001).</p>
<p>The faculty has supported and educated many key figures in the arts. In 2009 an Exhibition, <em>From Art School to University: Art and Design at Brighton 1859-2009</em>, paid tribute to many of them and included <a>Turner Prize</a> winners, iconic design work, cutting-edge dance for camera and classic rock and pop imagery.</p>
<p>It is also home to significant design and screen Archives and hosts the <a>Higher Education Academy Subject Centre for Art Design &amp; Media</a> (ADM HEA). In 2005 it was also recognised as a <a>Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning through Design</a> (CETLD), bringing together the knowledge and expertise of the University of Brighton's Faculty of Arts; The <a>Royal Institute of British Architects</a>; the <a>Royal College of Art</a> and The <a>Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a>.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Education and Sport</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Education and Sport is one of the university's largest faculties with about 4,000 students and 200 staff members. It is divided into the School of Service Management, the School of Education and Chelsea School. </p>
<p>In June 2010 the Faculty of Education and Sport retained the highest possible rating of &#x2018;Outstanding&#x2019; for its primary and secondary initial teacher education (teacher training) provision, following inspection by Ofsted.  In 2008 Brighton was the first university in the country to achieve an 'outstanding' rating for management and quality assurance across the full range of primary, secondary and post-compulsory (16+) teacher education courses. </p>
<p>The School of Service Management is at the forefront of teaching, research and consultancy in events, hospitality, retail, tourism and travel. The school is proud of its record of employability with 97.5% of graduates are either employed, self employed or continuing their studies approximately six months after leaving.</p>
<p>The School of Education is one of the largest providers of education and training for student teachers, teachers and other learning and development professionals in the country.</p>
<p>Chelsea School is known as a leader in the fields of sports science and physical education. Chelsea School was the first institution to offer degrees in Sport Journalism, which are still accredited by the NCTJ. </p>
<h3>Faculty of Health and Social Science</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|The Checkland Building houses the Faculty of Education and Sport, the School of Education and the Falmer element of the School of Humanities</a></p>
<p>The Faculty of Health offers degree programmes in nursing and midwifery; social policy, social science, social work and health promotion; medicine and primary care; and occupational therapy, physiotherapy and podiatry. </p>
<p>Research centres within this faculty include the Clinical Research Centre for Health Professions, Social Science Policy and Research Centre, Centre for Nursing and Midwifery Research and the International Health Development Research Centre, which has several on-going research projects on health promotion. The Faculty of Health and Social Science also sees to the development of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, which is a collaborative effort of the Universities of Brighton and Sussex. </p>
<h3>Brighton Business School</h3>
<p><a>Brighton Business School</a> delivers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, professional courses, and tailor-made programmes for commercial organisations. The school has around 1,500 full-time students, 1,000 part-time students and 120 members of academic staff. It provides teaching, research and consultancy in accounting, economics, finance, business, human resources, management, marketing and law.</p>
<p>Formerly part of Brighton Technical College, the school has been teaching business and management courses since the 1960s. It took its current name in 1998. The school is located in Mithras House on the Moulsecoomb campus.</p>
<p>Brighton Business School has built strong links with both local, national and international businesses and many of these companies offer placements to students. It is argued that such placements improve students' employability, and this is borne out by the school's employability record: over 90% of Business School students are employed or continuing their studies within six months of finishing their course.</p>
<p>The school runs a number of accredited degrees which lead to some exemptions from professional examinations. Professional bodies affiliated to the school include the <a>Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</a>, the <a>Chartered Institute of Management Accountants</a>, the <a>Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</a>, the <a>Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply</a>, the <a>Chartered Management Institute</a>, the <a>Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</a>, and <a>The Law Society</a>.</p>
<p>Brighton Business School hosts two research centres: the <a>Centre for Research in Innovation Management (CENTRIM)</a> and the <a>Centre for Research on Management and Employment (CROME)</a>. In the latest UK Research Assessment Exercise (2008), it was ranked as one of the top 15 business schools in terms of world-leading research outputs. 70% of the school's business and management research was found to be of international standing or higher.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Science and Engineering</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Science and Engineering offers a wide range of accredited programmes for undergraduates and postgraduates in chemistry, biology, earth science, and the physical sciences. It presently has over 2,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, more than 100 research students, and a staff of 200.  </p>
<p>The faculty hosts STEM Sussex which works in partnership with schools, businesses and other organisations to enhance delivery of the science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) curricula at all key stages and to improve achievements in these subjects.  The faculty also hosts the Sustainable Development Coordination Unit (SDeCU)  which aims to co-ordinate sustainable development activities across the university. The unit also has its own specific sustainability research and community engagement projects. </p>
<h3>Brighton and Sussex Medical School</h3>
<p>The <a>Brighton and Sussex Medical School</a> is one of four new medical schools to have been created as part of the UK government&#x2019;s strategy of increasing the number of qualified doctors from the UK working in the NHS.  As its name suggests, Brighton and Sussex Medical School is a joint school of the <a>University of Brighton</a> and the <a>University of Sussex</a>. ref&gt;<a>http://www.bsms.ac.uk/school-and-staff/about-bsms.php</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is a careful blend of the best of new and traditional teaching methods, with firm foundations on the established strengths of the two universities in educating and training health professionals and in science teaching and research. </p>
<p>The <a>University of Brighton</a> provides professional aspects of the course through its faculties of health, sciences and engineering, while the <a>University of Sussex</a> provides biological science teaching. The medical school requires human dissection of cadavers as a compulsory part of the course. This means the course is far more anatomically based than that of most other modern UK medical schools. As well as the emphasis on anatomy, BSMS also gives early clinical exposure, with students from preclinical years occasionally going on placements. </p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Research Performance</h3>
<p>Results from the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) have confirmed that 79 per cent of the university's research output is of international standing. Taking the top three grades, the results show that 15 per cent of the research is 'world-leading' (the highest grade), 29 per cent is internationally excellent (the second highest grade) and 35 per cent is internationally recognised (the third highest grade). </p>
<p>Among the highlights at the university, 65 per cent of research in art and design was classified as either 'world leading' or 'internationally excellent'. This places Brighton amongst the leading research centres in the country for art and design and Research Fortnight ranked the submission second in terms of the volume and quality of research. </p>
