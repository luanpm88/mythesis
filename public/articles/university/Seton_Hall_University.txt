<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>[[Image:Bayley 1876.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Founder Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]]]]  Like many Catholic universities in the United States, Seton Hall arose out of the <a>Plenary Council of American Bishops</a>, held in <a>Baltimore, Maryland</a> in 1844, with the goal of bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith. The <a>Diocese of Newark</a> had been established by <a>Pope Pius IX</a> in 1853, just three years before the founding of the college, and it necessitated an institution for higher learning. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom as well as several dormitory buildings in 1909.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight times and the <a>American Civil War</a>, the College continued to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) during the summer of 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the <a>Spanish-American War</a>. and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (now the <a>New Jersey Medical School</a>, part of the <a>University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</a>).</p>
<h3>Modernization period</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|left|200px|Statue of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton</a> --&gt; Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing in the next two decades, the university saw the construction and modernization of a large number of facilities and the construction of the library, science building, residence halls and the University center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged. <a>thumb|left|240px|The Walsh Library in spring.</a></p>
<p>The physical development of the campus continued in the 1990s. The $20&nbsp;million Walsh Library opened in 1994, and its first-class study and research resources marked the beginning of a technological transformation of Seton Hall. The University dedicated its newest academic center in 1997, originally named Kozlowski Hall for Dennis Kozlowski, former CEO of Tyco.  Renamed Jubilee Hall following Kozlowski's criminal conviction in 2005, the building is a clear example of Seton Hall's commitment to expanding the role of information technology in higher education. All classrooms in this six-story, 126,000&nbsp;square foot (12,000&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) building are wired for network and Internet connections, and many of the lecture halls are equipped with distance-learning technology. Its recreation center was originally named after Robert Brennan, but he was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. It has since been renamed for long-time athletic director <a>Richie Regan</a>. </p>
<p>A new School of Law building and parking garage were also constructed in the 1990s as part of the revitalization of downtown Newark. Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education, as well as in distance learning, with its renowned Seton World Wide program. In 1998, all incoming full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.</p>
<h3>Boland Hall fire</h3>
<p> On January 19, 2000, an arson fire killed three and injured 54 students in Boland Hall, a freshman <a>dormitory</a> on the campus in <a>South Orange</a>. The incident, one of the deadliest in recent US history, occurred at 4:30am, when most students were asleep. After a three-and-a-half year investigation, a 60-count <a>indictment</a> charged two freshmen students, Sean Ryan and Joseph LePore, with starting the fire and <a>felony murder</a> for the deaths that resulted.  LePore and Ryan pled guilty to third-degree <a>arson</a> and were sentenced to five years in a youth correctional facility with eligibility for parole 16&nbsp;months after the start of their prison terms.</p>
<h3>Sesquicentennial and onwards</h3>
<p>[[Image:SHUchapel.jpg|thumb|right|Immaculate Conception Chapel, built during the [[American Civil War]]]] Seton Hall alumni and community, on the 150th anniversary (1856&ndash;2006) of the university&#x2019;s founding, initiated the Ever Forward capital campaign to raise a total of $150&nbsp;million. The campaign is one of the most prestigious building campaigns in the University&#x2019;s long history. The funds will go to many areas throughout the university, however, a majority will go to building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites. </p>
<p>Among the most notable objectives of the campaign, there will be a new site and complex for the University&#x2019;s <a>Whitehead School of Diplomacy</a>. The University Center is also being planned to be rebuilt in a <a>neo-gothic</a> style to match other university buildings. Most recently, the rebuilding of the University&#x2019;s Science and Technology Center began in 2005 and was scheduled to be unveiled just prior to the start of the 2007-2008 academic year.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|Immaculate Conception Chapel shown here after undergoing renovations</a> --&gt; In fall 2007, the university opened the new $35&nbsp;million Science and Technology Center, completing one of the major campaign priorities ahead of schedule. On December 17, 2007, the university announced that the campaign's fund raising goals had been met and exceeded more than two weeks ahead of the campaign's scheduled closing date.</p>
<p>On June 4, 2009 University President Monsignor Robert Sheeran announced he will be stepping down in June 2010. The Board of Regents plans to establish a search committee over the summer, with the intent of finding and announcing Sheeran&#x2019;s successor by July 2010.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2010, the university drew criticism from the Archbishop of Newark, John J. Myer, after it was announced that a course called &quot;The Politics of Gay Marriage&quot; would be offered.  Catholic students also voiced their opposition, pointing to a conflict between the university's Catholic identity and what appeared to be the promotion of homosexuality in the classroom.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>The university, legally incorporated as &#x201c;Seton Hall University, an educational corporation of New Jersey,&#x201d; is governed by a 16-member Board of Trustees.  Eleven members of the board serve on it as a virtue of their positions within the University or <a>Archdiocese of Newark</a>. The <a>Archbishop of Newark</a>, who serves as the President of the Board, retains the power to appoint the remaining five members of the body. Appointed members of the board serve three-year terms, until their respective successor is appointed. The Board of Trustees exclusively maintains the property rights of the university and provides selection of title, scope, and location of the schools and colleges of the university.</p>
<p>The governance of the university includes a Board of Regents, which is charged with the management of the university. The Board has a membership of between 25 and 39 members. Six of the members are ex-officio; the Board of Trustees maintains the right to elect up to thirty more. Regents maintain the exclusive hiring authority over the President of the university, who, by virtue of the by-laws of the university, must always be a <a>Roman Catholic priest</a> and who is explicitly named the <a>chief executive officer</a> of the organization.</p>
<p>In May 2009, current president Monsignor Robert Sheeran announced that he will step down in June 2010. The university has engaged in a year-long <a>presidential search</a> to name his successor by July 1, 2010. University Regent Joseph P. LaSala is the chair of the Presidential Search and Screen Committee.</p>
<p>In January 2010 the search committee named the Interim President and former Provost, Dr A Gabriel Esteban as the 20th President of Seton Hall University.</p>

<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p> [[Image:Shucollegemap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A map from 1885 showing the Seton Hall College campus within the [[South Orange]] Village lines]] The main campus of Seton Hall University is situated on 58&nbsp;acres (23&nbsp;ha) of suburban land on South Orange Avenue. It is home to seven of the eight schools and colleges of the University. The <a>South Orange Village</a> center is just &#x00bd;&nbsp;mile (0.8&nbsp;km) south of the main campus. Directly across from the main campus to the west are scenic Montrose Park and the Montrose Park Historic District, which is listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. The village itself dates back to 1666 preceding the establishment of Seton Hall College. Since the beginning of the College, the <a>South Orange Rail Station</a> has served as an integral means to campus commuters. The main campus combines architectural styles including <a>Roman</a>, <a>neo-gothic</a> and <a>modern</a>. The South Orange campus became a gated community during the University&#x2019;s Modernization Period.</p>

<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>The original centerpieces of the campus were made up of three buildings built in the 19th century. The President&#x2019;s, Stafford and Marshall Hall were built when the College moved from <a>Madison, New Jersey</a> to <a>South Orange</a>. Some of the more notable buildings on campus are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>President's Hall</strong> &#x2013; One of the oldest buildings on campus and a flagship of the University, President&#x2019;s Hall was completed in 1867. Located at the epicenter of the main campus, President&#x2019;s Hall is a <a>neo-gothic</a> structure dressed in <a>brownstone</a>. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the University&#x2019;s administration including the Office of the University President. The halls are lined with portraits of past University presidents and include a large <a>stained glass</a> depicting <a>Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton</a>, which was commissioned in 1866 by President Bayley.</li>
  <li><strong>McQuaid Hall</strong> &#x2013; Built around 1900, it was named for Bishop Bernard J. McQuaid, Seton Hall&#x2019;s first President from 1856&ndash;1857 and 1859&ndash;1867.  Built in 1997, it is one of the newer additions to the main campus.</li>
  <li><strong><a>Walsh Gymnasium</a></strong> is a multi-purpose <a>arena</a> for University Sports. The arena opened in 1939 and can seat 2,600 people. Additionally, Seton Hall celebrated Earth Day 2010, marking the event with demonstrations about composting and rainwater collection, a group hike, and an outdoor screening of the environmental documentary &quot;HOME.&quot;</p>
<p>On the College Sustainability Report Card 2010, Seton Hall earned a grade of &quot;D-&quot;. Lack of endowment transparency and green building initiatives hurt the grade, while the recycling programs were a plus.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Seton Hall University confers <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>graduate</a>, and <a>postgraduate</a> degrees in over 70 academic fields. The school's academic programs are divided into nine academic units:</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>University seal</h3>
<p>The University seal as it is today is symbolic of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley <a>Coat of Arms</a> and the <a>Seton</a> family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes <a>Scottish nobility</a>. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three <a>crescents</a> and three <a>torteau</a>.&lt;br&gt; The motto on the seal <em>Hazard Zet Forward</em> (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of <a>Norman French</a> and archaic English meaning <em>at whatever risk, yet go forward</em>. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal in the middle of the university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate.</p>
<h3>Alma Mater</h3>
<p>The <em>Seton Hall University Alma Mater</em> was adopted as the official song of Seton Hall University. Charles A. Byrne of the class of 1937 wrote the original lyrics in 1936 and the university adopted the alma mater during the 1937 school year when the dean first read it to the student body. Some students participate in the tradition of saying &quot;blue and white&quot; more loudly than the rest of the alma mater.</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>&quot;Onward Setonia&quot; is Seton Hall's fight song and it is played by the University Pep Band at all home Men's and Women's basketball games, usually as the team comes onto the court and at the end of the first half and at the end of the game. The lyrics are as follows: &quot;Onward Setonia,  We are bound for victory. Hazard Zet Forward, We will honor that decree. Onward Setonia,  Stand up proud and stand up tall.  FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!  For the Blue and White,  and the glory of Seton Hall.&quot;</p>
