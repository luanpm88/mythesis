<p><strong>Texas A&amp;M University</strong>, often referred to as <strong>A&amp;M</strong> or <strong>TAMU</strong>, is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in <a>College Station</a>, <a>Texas</a>. It is the <a>flagship</a> institution of the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>. The seventh-largest university in the United States, A&amp;M enrolls over 49,000 students in ten academic colleges. Texas A&amp;M's designation as a <a>land</a>, <a>sea</a>, and <a>space grant</a> institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the <a>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, and the <a>Office of Naval Research</a>. The school ranks in the top 20 American research institutes in terms of funding and has made notable contributions to such fields as <a>animal cloning</a> and <a>petroleum engineering</a>.</p>
<p>The first public institution of higher education in Texas, the school opened on October 4, 1876&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas A&amp;M University Fact Sheet&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the <a>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</a>.  Its original mission was to educate males in farming and military techniques.  Under the leadership of President <a>James Earl Rudder</a>, in the 1960s A&amp;M desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the <a>Corps of Cadets</a>.  To reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings, the <a>Texas Legislature</a> renamed the school to Texas A&amp;M University in 1963.  The letters &quot;A&amp;M,&quot; originally short for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical,&quot; are retained only as a link to the university's past.  The school's students, <a>alumni</a>&lt;!--&quot;alumni&quot; INCLUDES former students, not just graduates--&gt;, and sports teams are known as &quot;<a>Aggies</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The main campus is one of the largest in America, spanning ,&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUCatalog&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUfacts&quot;/&gt; and includes the <a>George Bush Presidential Library</a>.  Approximately one-fifth of the student body lives on campus.   Texas A&amp;M has approximately 800 officially recognized student organizations.  Many students also observe the <a>traditions of Texas A&amp;M University</a>, which govern daily life as well as special occasions, including sports events.  Aggie sports teams compete in the <a>Big 12 Conference</a>.  A&amp;M operates two branches: <a>Texas A&amp;M at Qatar</a> and <a>Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston</a>. Working with agencies such as the <a>Texas AgriLife Research</a> and <a>Texas AgriLife Extension Service</a>, Texas A&amp;M has a direct presence in each of the 254 counties in Texas. The university offers degrees in over 150 courses of study through ten colleges and houses 18 research institutes. Texas A&amp;M has awarded over 320,000 degrees, including 70,000 graduate and professional degrees.&lt;!--The degree count is 320,000. Former student count is 280,000. Some students have multiple degrees (e.g. multiple undergrad degrees, Master's degree, etc.--&gt;</p>
<p>As a <a>Senior Military College</a>, Texas A&amp;M is one of three public universities with a full-time, volunteer Corps of Cadets. It provides more commissioned officers to the <a>United States Armed Forces</a> than any other school outside of the <a>service academies</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush Commencement Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|left|Texas A&amp;M in 1883|alt=In the middle of a prairie sit two four-story buildings. Two smaller and less ornate buildings are spread between them.</a></p>
<h3>Beginning years</h3>
<p>The <a>U.S. Congress</a> laid the groundwork for the establishment of Texas A&amp;M in 1862 with the adoption of the <a>Morrill Act</a>. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  In 1871, the <a>Texas Legislature</a> used these funds to establish the state's first public institution of higher education,&lt;ref name=&quot;txconstitution&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, then known as Texas A.M.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  <a>Brazos County</a> donated  near <a>Bryan, Texas</a> for the school's campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Classes began on October 4, 1876, with 40 students and 6 faculty members.  Admission was limited to white males, and all students were required to participate in the <a>Corps of Cadets</a> and receive military training.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff1617&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment climbed to 258 students before declining to 108 students in 1883, the year the <a>University of Texas</a> opened in <a>Austin, Texas</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally envisioned and annotated in Texas law as a part of the <a>University of Texas System</a>, Texas A.M.C. had a separate Board of Directors from the University of Texas from the first day of classes and was never enveloped into the University of Texas system.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>[[File:AcademicBuildingA&amp;M.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|Lawrence Sullivan &quot;Sul&quot; Ross]] located in front of the Academic Building|alt=A large domed building overlooks a full-length statue of balding white male with a mustache and long goatee and wearing a knee-length coat.  The pedestal is engraved &quot;Lawrence Sullivan Ross&quot;. ]] In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A&amp;M was saved from potential closure by its new president <a>Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a>, former <a>governor of Texas</a> and well-respected <a>Confederate</a> <a>Brigadier General</a>. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A&amp;M &quot;to learn to be like Ross&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure, many enduring <a>Aggie traditions</a> were born, including the creation of the first <a>Aggie Ring</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;/&gt; After his death in 1898, a statue was erected in front of what is now Academic Plaza to honor Ross and his achievements in the history of the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Under pressure from the legislature, in 1911 the school began allowing women to attend classes during the summer semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, A&amp;M began expanding its academic pursuits with the establishment of the <a>School of Veterinary Medicine</a> in 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>World Wars era</h3>
<p>Many Texas A&amp;M graduates served during <a>World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I</a>. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;liffick&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,200&nbsp;former students served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&amp;M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  The first graduate school was organized in 1924 and the school awarded its first Ph.D. in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&amp;M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;crawford&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;  The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Many Aggies again served in the military during <a>World War II</a>, with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than any other school and more than the combined total of the <a>United States Naval Academy</a> and the <a>United States Military Academy</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;adams160&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, 29 A&amp;M graduates reached the rank of general.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Enrollment soared after the war as many former soldiers used the <a>G.I. Bill</a> to further their education.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillentine&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the state Legislature formally recognized Texas A&amp;M as a separate university system from the University of Texas System, codifying the <a>de facto</a> arrangement between the schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>University era</h3>
<p>On March 26, 1960, <a>Major General</a> <a>James Earl Rudder</a>, class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff184&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rudder's tenure (1959&#x2013;1970) marked a critical turning point in the school's history. Under his leadership, Texas A&amp;M underwent a dramatic expansion in terms of its physical plant construction, but more importantly, it diversified and expanded its student body by admitting women and minorities. The Corps of Cadets became voluntary. In the face of growing student activism during the 1960s, Rudder worked diligently to ensure that school continue to fulfill its mission of providing a quality education for all Aggies. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Bean, &quot;James Earl Rudder and the Transformation of Texas A&amp;M University,&quot; <em>Journal of South Texas</em> (Fall 2008), Vol. 21 Issue 2, pp 119-31&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1963, the 58th <a>Legislature of Texas</a> approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school &quot;Texas A&amp;M University&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; specifying that the &quot;A&quot; and the &quot;M&quot; were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In the following 35&nbsp;years, Texas A&amp;M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000&nbsp;&lt;!--Measurement of population--&gt;students to over 45,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUfacts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Texas A&amp;M became one of the first four universities given the designation <a>sea-grant</a> for its achievements in <a>oceanography</a> and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title <a>space-grant</a> by <a>NASA</a>, to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|George Bush Presidential Library|alt=Above the doorway of a large, relatively plain rectangular structure with a short dome are the words &quot;George Bush Library&quot;. In front of the building is a circular courtyard with a water fountain; eight American flags are positioned evenly around the circle.</a> In 1997, the school became the home of the <a>George Bush Presidential Library</a>. Operated by the <a>National Archives and Records Administration</a>, it is one of thirteen American <a>presidential libraries</a>. Former President <a>George Bush</a> remains actively involved with the university, frequently visiting the campus and participating in special events.&lt;ref name=&quot;bushlibrary&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bushlibopens&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Texas A&amp;M received national media attention on November 18, 1999, when <a>Aggie Bonfire</a>, a ninety-year-old student tradition, collapsed during construction. Twelve current and former students died and twenty-seven others were injured. The accident was later attributed to improper design and poor construction practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;homeland&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The victims' family members filed six lawsuits against Texas A&amp;M officials, the student Bonfire leaders, and the university. Half of the defendants settled their portion of the case in 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;kapitan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against the university in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderwerf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>With strong support from <a>Rice University</a> and the <a>University of Texas at Austin</a>, the <a>Association of American Universities</a> inducted Texas A&amp;M in May 2001, on the basis of the depth of the university's research and academic programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggie_Daily&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, university President <a>Robert Gates</a> resigned from his position to become the U.S. <a>Secretary of Defense</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;newpresdent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  <a>Elsa Murano</a> became his replacement in January 2008, but later resigned in June 2009&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by <a>R. Bowen Loftin</a></p>

The student body represents all 50 <a>U.S. state</a>s and 130 foreign countries.  Texas residents account for 86% of the student population, and 28.9% are either of international origin or members of ethnic <a>minority groups</a>.  The student body consists of 46.8% women and 53.2% men.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMU_Office_of_Institutional_Studies_and_Planning&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Although Texas A&amp;M is a secular institution, its student body has a reputation for being <a>religious</a> and <a>conservative</a>.  According to a 2005 student survey published in the Princeton Review, Texas A&amp;M ranked 13th highest in the category &quot;students pray on a regular basis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conserv1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Four years later, the Princeton Review ranked Texas A&amp;M the eighth most <a>socially conservative</a> campus in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conserv2&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;  This conservative trend is especially notable in the Corps of Cadets.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadetsconservative&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The university consistently ranks among the top ten public universities each year in enrollment of <a>National Merit</a> scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalMerit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the <a>College Board</a>, the fall 2008 entering freshman class consisted of 54% students in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, 86% in the top quarter, and 99% in the top half.&lt;ref name=&quot;CollegeBoard1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventy-four percent of these students took the <a>SAT</a>.  The middle 50% of the freshmen had average scores as follows: &lt;!-- Simply adding the low scores together, and the high scores and getting one range of average scores is statistically incorrect. --&gt; in critical reading, 520&#x2013;630, math, 560&#x2013;670, and in writing 500&#x2013;610.

<p>During the fall 2008 semester, the <a>Dwight Look College of Engineering</a> had the largest enrollment of 20.5%.  The <a>College of Liberal Arts</a> and the <a>College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a> followed, enrolling 15% and 14% of the student body, respectively.  The <a>College of Education and Human Development</a> enrolls 12%, and <a>Mays Business School</a> enrolled about 11%.  Colleges with less than 10% enrollment included the <a>College of Architecture</a>, the <a>College of Science</a>, the <a>George Bush School of Government and Public Service</a>, the <a>College of Geosciences</a>, and the <a>College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences</a>.

<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> Texas A&amp;M consistently scores among the top universities in the United States as determined by various national and international publications.  In the 2011 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranking of <a>public universities</a>, Texas A&amp;M is listed 22nd; among &quot;national universities&quot; the school tied for 63rd place.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In the <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> ranking, Texas A&amp;M tied with <a>Clemson University</a>, <a>Fordham University</a>, <a>Purdue University</a>, and the <a>University of Minnesota</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to  <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> criteria, which considers research, community service, and social mobility, Texas A&amp;M ranks fifth nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashingtonMonthly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The <a>John Templeton Foundation</a> listed Texas A&amp;M as one of the thirty-five American college programs that &quot;communicate[s] the values of honesty, trust, respect, responsibility, integrity, and fairness in the classroom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;honestly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2011 <em><a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a></em> ranked the school as the 23th best-value public university on the basis of in-state tuition, and the 35th best-value public university on the basis of out-of-state tuition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiplinger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting a survey of leading employment recruiters, the <a>Wall Street Journal</a> ranked Texas A&amp;M 2nd nationally, as &quot;most likely to help students land a job in key careers and professions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the National Science Foundation has recognized Texas A&amp;M as one of the top 20 research institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Battalion&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>Apart from revenue received from tuition and research grants, the university, as part of the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a> (TAMUS), is partially funded from two endowments.  The smaller endowment, totaling $1.17 billion in assets, is run by the private Texas A&amp;M Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;  A larger sum is distributed from the Texas <a>Permanent University Fund</a> (PUF).  TAMUS holds a minority stake (one-third) in this fund; the remaining two-thirds belongs to the University of Texas system. As of 2006, the PUF ending net asset value stood at $10.3&nbsp;billion; $400.7&nbsp;million was distributed to the two university systems in fiscal year 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;puf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;handbookoftexas&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Combined, the total endowment for the TAMUS stands at $5.6&nbsp;billion, as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|</a>The Texas A&amp;M University system, in 2006, was the first to explicitly state in its policy that technology commercialization was a criterion that could be used for <a>tenure</a>. Passage of this policy was intended to give faculty more academic freedom and strengthen the university's industry partnerships.&lt;ref name=&quot;tenure1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenure2&quot;&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt;  Texas A&amp;M works with both state and university agencies on various local and international research projects to forge innovations in science and technology that can have commercial applications. This work is concentrated in two primary locations&#x2013;Research Valley and Research Park. Research Valley, an alliance of educational and business organizations, consists of  with  of dedicated research space.  An additional , with  of research space, is located in Research Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the school's research entities are the <a>Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine</a>, the <a>Texas Transportation Institute</a>, the Cyclotron Institute, the <a>Institute of Biosciences and Technology</a>, and the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=&quot;centers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004, Texas A&amp;M received nearly $570 million in research funding, ranking the school among the top 20 American research institutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMU_Facts_Research&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Almost $400 million of the grants were new awards.  Throughout 2004, Texas A&amp;M System faculty and research submitted 121 new inventions and established 78 new royalty-bearing licensing agreements; the innovations resulted in income of $8 million. The Texas A&amp;M Technology Licensing Office filed for 88 <a>patent</a>s for protection of <a>intellectual property</a> in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Spearheaded by the <a>College of Veterinary Medicine</a>, Texas A&amp;M scientists created the first cloned domestic animal, a <a>cat</a> named 'cc', on December 22, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClonedCat&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Texas A&amp;M was also the first academic institution to <a>clone</a> each of six different species: cattle, a <a>Boer goat</a>,&lt;!--Boer should be capitalized, do not change--&gt; pigs, a cat, a deer and a horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC_News&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004, Texas A&amp;M joined a consortium of universities to build the <a>Giant Magellan Telescope</a> in <a>Chile</a>. Estimated to be the largest optical telescope ever constructed, the facility will have seven mirrors, each with a diameter of .  This will give the telescope the equivalent of a  primary mirror and will be ten times more powerful than the <a>Hubble Space Telescope</a>. Construction is slated to be complete in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMTO&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>As part of a collaboration with the <a>U.S. Department of Energy</a>'s <a>National Nuclear Security Administration</a>, Texas A&amp;M completed the first conversion of a <a>nuclear research reactor</a> from using highly-enriched <a>uranium</a> fuel (70%) to utilizing low-enriched uranium (20%).  The eighteen-month project ended on October 13, 2006, after the first ever refueling the reactor, thus fulfilling a portion of <a>U.S. President</a> <a>George W.

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|A view of the main campus, looking north from Kyle Field. At the center is the Academic Building with its copper dome</a>  Texas A&amp;M's <a>College Station</a> campus, one of the largest in America, spans  plus  for Research Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUCatalog&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUfacts&quot;/&gt; The university is part of the <a>Bryan-College Station metropolitan area</a> located within <a>Brazos County</a> in the <a>Brazos Valley</a> (Southeast Central Texas) region, an area often referred to as &quot;Aggieland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aggieland&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; According the <a>U.S. Census Bureau</a>, as of 2008, the population of Brazos County is estimated at 175,122.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <em><a>Money Magazine</a></em>, in 2006, named College Station the most educated city in Texas, and the 11th most educated American city, due largely to the size of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Education&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aggieland is centrally located within  of three of the 10 largest cities in the United States and 75% of the <a>Texas</a> and <a>Louisiana</a> populations (approximately 13.1 million people). The area's major roadway is <a>State Highway 6</a>, and several smaller state highways and <a>Farm to Market Road</a>s connect the area to larger highways such as <a>Interstate 45</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcschamber&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The campus is bisected by a railroad track operated by <a>Union Pacific</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;lukejackson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The area east of the tracks, known as Main Campus, includes buildings for the colleges of engineering, architecture, geosciences, science, education and liberal arts. Dormitories, as well as the main dining centers and many campus support facilities, are also on Main Campus. Notable buildings on Main Campus include <a>Kyle Field</a>, Sterling C. Evans Library,the Academic Building, Harrington Hall, the Memorial Student Center, the Administration Building, Rudder Tower, Albritton Bell Tower, and the <a>Bonfire Memorial</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;campusname&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of the railroad tracks lies West Campus, which includes most of the sports facilities, the business school, agricultural programs, the veterinary college, the political science and economics school, the <a>George Bush School of Government and Public Service</a>, the <a>George Bush Presidential Library</a> and two schools within the <a>Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center</a>.

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p><a>Sbisa Dining Hall and central utility plant water tower sporting the greeting, &quot;Welcome to Aggieland&quot;|thumb|right</a> During the 2006 fall semester, 20.5 percent of the student body lived on campus in one of two distinct housing sections located on opposite ends of campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMU_Office_of_Institutional_Studies_and_Planning&quot; /&gt; Both the Northside and Southside areas contain student dormitories, also known as residence halls. While some halls are single-sex, others are <a>co-educational</a>. Usually students of different genders live on alternate floors, although some halls are segregated by room or suite.&lt;ref name=&quot;womack&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Residence hall styles vary. Many halls offer only indoor access to individual rooms, but other halls locate room entrances on an outdoor balcony. Room sizes vary by building. Halls with larger rooms include en-suite or private bathrooms, while halls with smaller rooms have a common bathroom on each floor. Several halls include a &quot;substance-free&quot; floor, where residents pledge to avoid bringing <a>alcohol</a>, <a>drugs</a>, or <a>cigarette</a>s into the hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;dorms2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Northside consists of 17 student residence halls, including the 3 university honors dorms.&lt;ref name=&quot;northside&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The halls are located near local entertainment district <a>Northgate</a>, and offer convenient access to campus dining establishments: Sbisa Dining Hall, The Underground and Bernie's Cafe. The demolition of Moore Hall, Crocker Hall, and McInnis Hall is scheduled for August 2011&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. A $58 million 600-bed residence hall will replace the demolished halls that have accommodated roughly the same number. Some halls (particularly Walton, Moore and Crocker) have unofficially claimed tables within the Sbisa Dining Hall and many halls congregate for dinner at a specific time each weekday.&lt;ref name=&quot;hixson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Several of the residence halls located on Southside are reserved for members of the <a>Corps of Cadets</a>. Non-corps halls in this area center around the Commons, a hub for activities and dining.&lt;ref name=&quot;commons&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Southside has two Learning Living Communities, which allow freshmen to live in a cluster with other students who share common interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;lllc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle, or <a>&quot;The Quad&quot;</a>, an area consisting of dormitories, Duncan Dining Hall, and the Corps training fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadethandbook&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Corps Arches, a series of 12 arches that &quot;[symbolize] the spirit of <a>the 12th Man</a> of Texas A&amp;M&quot;, mark the entrance to the Quadrangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;arches&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; All cadets, except those who are married or who have had previous military service, must live in the Quad with assigned roommates from the same unit and graduating class. <a>Reveille</a>, the Aggie <a>mascot</a>, lives with her handlers in the Quadrangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadetresidenthandbook&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Corps of Cadets</h3>

Each holds a bugle that dangles a pennant.]] Texas A&amp;M is one of six United States <a>Senior Military College</a>s.  The schools' <a>Corps of Cadets</a> (or <em>the Corps</em>) is the United States' largest uniformed student body outside the <a>service academies</a>.  Many members participate in <a>ROTC</a> programs and earn commissions in the <a>United States Armed Forces</a> upon graduation.  Members of the Corps have served in every <a>armed conflict</a> fought by the United States since 1876, and over 225 have served as <a>general</a>s or <a>Flag Officers</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadetsconservative&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Until 1965, Corps membership was mandatory. The Corps welcomed female members in the fall of 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;nauman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as of fall 2007, the co-ed Corps boasts an enrollment of 1,887&nbsp;cadets.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMU_Office_of_Institutional_Studies_and_Planning&quot;/&gt; [[File:RobertGates TAMU SeniorBoots.JPEG|thumb|left|[[Robert Gates]] and senior cadets from the Corps of Cadets give the &quot;gig 'em&quot; sign at the <a>Pentagon</a>.]]</p>
<p>The Corps is composed of two Air Force Wings, three Army Brigades, two Navy and Marine Regiments, and a joint military unit called The Task Force, as well as the <a>Fightin' Texas Aggie Band</a>, whose members may be affiliated with any military branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;corpssize&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cadets are called &quot;Keepers of the Spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keepers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Parson's Mounted Cavalry is the only mounted ROTC unit in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParsonsCav&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Ross Volunteer Company, the oldest student-run organization in the state, is the official honor guard for the <a>Governor of Texas</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorpsAbout&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The Fish Drill Team, a precision, close-order rifle drill team composed entirely of Corps freshmen, represents the school in local and national competitions. They have won the national championship almost every year since their creation in 1946, and have appeared in several Hollywood productions, with prominent roles in the movies <em><a>A Few Good Men</a></em> and <em><a>Courage Under Fire</a></em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishdrillteam&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>Fightin' Texas Aggie Band</a>, the world's largest precision <a>military</a> <a>marching band</a>, provides music for University functions and presents intricate halftime performances at football games.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorpsAbout&quot;/&gt; Some band drills are so complicated that they require band members to step between each other's feet to complete the maneuvers.&lt;ref name=&quot;steponfeet&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These drills must be drawn by hand as computer marching programs have returned errors; their calculations   require two people to be in the same spot at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;errorband&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>[[File:Texas A&amp;M University Solar Decathlon 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The solar-powered house that Texas A&amp;M students built for the [[Solar Decathlon]] in 2007.]] Texas A&amp;M has over 800 student organizations, including academic, service, religious, <a>Greek</a>, and common interest organizations. Orientation programs encourage students to become involved in campus activities and organizations from the beginning.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsletter2003_12_4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An April 2005 campus survey found that 74% of the students were currently involved with at least one organization and that 88% participated in a campus organization in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;studentinvolvement&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>One of the oldest student organizations is the <a>Singing Cadets</a>, founded in 1893. Known as the &quot;Voice of Aggieland&quot;, the Singing Cadets are an all-male choral group with 70 members. The group travels nationally and has completed several international tours; most recently, South America in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;singingcadets&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Texas A&amp;M Hillel</a>, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920 at the original college. The organization occurred three years before the national <a>Hillel Foundation</a> was organized at <a>University of Illinois</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillel2&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|Student Rec Center|left</a> The Graduate Student Council, founded in 1995, serves as the student government for Texas A&amp;M University&#x2019;s graduate and professional students. It is a council representing all TAMU graduate students with a purpose to improve graduate students&#x2019; academic, living and social experiences. The GSC represents student&#x2019;s concerns and is their liaison with the University Administration. &lt;ref name=&quot;GSC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Students <a>exercise</a> at the Student Rec Center, a three-story facility encompassing , which includes exercise equipment, athletic courts, an indoor running track, a rock-climbing tower, and one of the top competitive pools and diving wells in America. The Rec Center also organizes intramural sports throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;reccenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Some national service organizations originated at A&amp;M. Aggie students founded the largest one-day student-run service project in America known as The Big Event. The annual service project allows students to give back to their community by assisting local residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigevent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The organization CARPOOL, a student run, <a>safe ride program</a> has provided over 139,000&nbsp;free&nbsp;rides (as of January 2009) to Aggies unable to transport themselves home. Its organizers also assist other universities in establishing similar programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpool1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carpool2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carpool3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the <a>Corporation for National and Community Service</a> listed A&amp;M among the 500 academic institutions in the 2005&#x2013;06 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;honorroll&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Student Government Association (SGA), one of A&amp;M's largest organizations, consists of over 1,300 student members in 3 branches, 15 committees, and 4 commissions. SGA has changed little since 1972, except its relative position within the official framework of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;StudentSenate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p><em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> ranked <em><a>The Battalion</a></em>, founded in 1893, as the 5th best college newspaper in America in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;battranking&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Students also publish a secondary school newspaper, the <em>Maroon Weekly</em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;maroonweekly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <em>Aggieland</em>, formerly known as <em>The Olio</em> and <em>The Longhorn</em>, is one of America's largest college yearbooks in number of pages and copies sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgYearbook&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AgYearbook2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The university houses the public broadcasting stations: <em><a>KAMU-TV</a></em>, a <a>PBS</a> member station since 1970, <em><a>KAMU-FM</a></em> an <a>NPR</a> affiliate since 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;KBTXKAMUFM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the student-run <em><a>KANM</a></em>, &quot;the college station of <a>College Station</a>&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KANM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; W5AC broadcast the first live, play-by-play broadcast of a college football game, at Kyle Field, in November 1921. The game, played in Dallas between Aggies and <a>University of Texas</a>, ended in a scoreless tie.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>  <a>thumb|right|Aggie Ring for the class of 2004|alt=Close-up of gold ring. On the top, the words Texas A&amp;M University 1876 encircle an eagle atop a shield over the numbers 0 and 4. The left side contains a large star and an oak. The right shows a cannon, saber, and rifle with the crossed flags of the United States and Texas.</a> The Texas A&amp;M culture is a product of the university's founding as a rural military and agricultural school.  Although the school and surrounding community have grown, and military training is no longer required, the <a>school's history</a> has instilled in students &quot;the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;burka2000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  <em><a>Texas Monthly</a></em> posits that Texas A&amp;M students' respect for school <a>traditions</a> and values is the university's greatest strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;burkaNov2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, while others have been introduced more recently.  These traditions help current and former students to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a sense of loyalty and respect for the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;tresaugue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They dictate many aspects of student life, including how to greet others (using the official school greeting &quot;Howdy!&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;hallett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; how to act at an A&amp;M sporting event, and, in many cases, what words a student may use in conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gravois&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The most visible tradition among seniors and former students is the wearing of the <a>Aggie Ring</a>, whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;kane&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Students may order a ring after completing 90 <a>credit hours</a> of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&amp;M, or after graduation. Graduate students may receive a ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ring2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Though unsanctioned by the University, many students &quot;dunk&quot; their newly acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and quickly chug the entire pitcher to &quot;earn&quot; the ring. Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ring3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at <a>Reed Arena</a> on the <a>Texas A&amp;M University campus</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;lozano&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent.  As the names of the deceased Aggies are called, a family member or friend answers &quot;Here&quot; and lights a candle, to symbolize that although their loved one is not present in body, his or her spirit will shine forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;lopez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;silvertaps&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The event received worldwide attention during <a>World War II</a>, when 25 Aggies &quot;mustered&quot; during the <a>battle</a> for the island of <a>Corregidor</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&amp;M are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month.  This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&amp;M president <a>Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;hegstrom&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 p.m. the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a <a>21-gun salute</a> by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six <a>buglers</a> play an A&amp;M version of the song <em><a>Taps</a></em>, Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.&lt;ref name=&quot;silvertaps&quot;/&gt;</p>

<h4>12th Man</h4>
<p>Aggie <a>football</a> fans are called the <a>12th Man</a>, meaning they are there to support the 11 players on the field, willing to enter the game, if necessary. To further symbolize their &quot;readiness, desire, and enthusiasm,&quot; the entire student body stands throughout the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;12thMan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition began on January 2, 1922, at the <a>Dixie Classic</a> where A&amp;M played <a>Centre College</a>. A&amp;M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that <a>Coach D. X. Bible</a> feared he wouldn&#x2019;t have enough men to finish the game.  He called into the stands for <a>E. King Gill</a>, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball.  Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&amp;M won 22&#x2013;14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies.&lt;ref name=&quot;beano&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent decades, the 12th Man is represented on the field by a <a>walk-on</a> player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick-offs.&lt;ref name=&quot;heater&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams. Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;alvaradoyell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At <a>midnight</a> before each home <a>football</a> game at Kyle Field or at a predesignated location at away games, the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day's game.&lt;ref name=&quot;hallett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drehs&quot;/&gt; Led by the Yell Leaders, and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, the Twelfth Man files into the stadium to participate in <a>Midnight Yell Practice</a> to practice yells, sing the <a>War Hymn</a>, and joke about their opponents. At the conclusion of the yell practice, the stadium lights are extinguished and fans kiss their dates.  This is also done as practice, because Aggies are expected to &quot;mug down&quot;, or kiss their dates, every time the football team scores on the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;drehs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mugdown&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> named Midnight Yell as one of the &quot;100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;si100&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Bonfire</h4>
<p>Almost every year since 1909, A&amp;M students have built a large bonfire to celebrate their &quot;burning desire to beat the hell outta&quot; the University of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Aggie Bonfire</a> was traditionally lit around <a>Thanksgiving</a> in conjunction with the festivities surrounding the annual <a>college football</a> game between the schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein&quot;/&gt; Though it began as a trash pile,&lt;ref name=&quot;as&quot; &gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive six-tiered structure, the world record being held at .&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;WorldRec&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After the collapse of the 1999 structure, causing the death of 11 students and one former student, the university suspended Bonfire indefinitely, but the tradition continues off-campus without direct University involvement, sanction, or participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;milloy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;badger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
