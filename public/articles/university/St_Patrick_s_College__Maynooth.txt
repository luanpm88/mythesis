<p><strong>St Patrick's College, Maynooth</strong> ()  is the &quot;National Seminary for Ireland&quot;, <a>Roman Catholic</a>, and a Pontifical University. The <a>college</a> and <a>seminary</a> are often referred to as <strong>Maynooth College</strong> located in the village of Maynooth, 15 miles from Dublin, Ireland. The college was officially established as the <em>Roman Catholic College of St Patrick</em> by an Act of <a>Grattan's Parliament</a> in 1795, Mr. <a>Thomas Pelham</a>, the Secretary of State, introduced his Bill for the foundation of a Catholic college. There are approximately 80 men studying for the priesthood at Maynooth, in 2011; [73 resident seminarians and some non residents]. It is now the only major seminary in Ireland.</p>
<p>Degrees are awarded by the <strong>Pontifical University</strong> at Maynooth, which was established by a <a>Pontifical Charter</a> of 1896. The Pontifical Charter entitles the university to grant degrees in <a>canon law</a>, <a>philosophy</a> and <a>theology</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town of Maynooth, Co. Kildare was the seat of the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Kildare.</p>
<p>The ivy-covered tower attached to St. Mary's Protestant Church is all that remains of the ancient college of St. Mary of Maynooth which was founded and endowed by Gerald 8th Earl of Kildare and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1518, the 9th Earl presented a petition to the then Archbishop of Dublin (William Rockeby) 1511 : 1521, for a license to found and endow a College at Maynooth. The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The college was created against the background of the <a>upheaval during the French Revolution</a> and the gradual removal of the <a>penal laws</a>. Until this time a significant number of Catholic priests were educated on the <a>European continent</a>, particularly in France.</p>
<p>The college was established on 5 June 1795 (35 Geo III, cap. 21) as <em>The Royal College of St Patrick</em>, by act of the <a>Parliament of Ireland</a> to provide &quot;for the better education of persons professing the <a>popish</a> or <a>Roman Catholic</a> religion&quot;.  The College in Maynooth was originally established to provide a university education for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students, the lay college was based in <a>Riverstown House</a> on the south campus from 1802. With the opening of <a>Clongowes Wood</a> in 1814, the lay college (which had lay trustees) was closed  and the college functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years.</p>
<p>The college was particularly intended to provide for the education of Catholic priests in Ireland, who prior to the Act had to go to the continent for training. The added value in this was the reduction of the amount of priests returning from training in <a>revolutionary France</a> (with whom Britain was at war) thus discouraging potential revolution. The value to the government was proved by the condemnation by the Catholic Church hierarchy of the <a>1798 rebellion</a> and later support for the Act of Union.</p>
<p>In 1800, <a>John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne</a> died and left a substantial fortune to the College. Butler had been a Roman Catholic, Bishop of Cork, who had embraced <a>Protestantism</a> in order to marry and guarantee the succession to his hereditary title. However, there were no children to his marriage and it was alleged that he had been reconciled to the Catholic Church at his death. Were this the case, a <a>penal law</a> demanded that the <a>will</a> was invalid and his wealth would pass to his family. Much <a>litigation</a> followed before a negotiated settlement in 1808 that led to the establishment of a Dunboyne scholarship fund.</p>
<p>The land was donated by the <a>William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster</a> who had argued in favour of Catholic Emancipation in the <a>Irish House of Lords</a>. He lived nearby at <a>Carton</a> and also at <a>Leinster House</a>. The building work was paid for by the <a>British Government</a>; parliament continued to give it an annual grant until the <a>Irish Church Act 1869</a>. When this law was passed the College received a capital sum of &#x00a3;369,000.  The trustees invested 75% of this in mortgages to Irish landowners at a yield of 4.25% - 4.75% per annum. This would have been considered a secure investment at that time but agitation for land reform and the depression of the 1870s eroded this security.  The largest single mortgage was granted to the <a>Earl of Granard</a>. Accumulated losses on these transactions reached &#x00a3;35,000 by 1906. </p>
<p>The first building to go up on this site was designed by, and named after, <a>John Stoyte</a>; Stoyte House, which can still be seen from the entrance to the old campus, is a well-known building to Maynooth students and stands in close proximity to the very historic <a>Maynooth Castle</a>. Over the next 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St. Joseph's Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. <a>Laurence F. Renehan</a> (1797&#x2013;1857) - a noted antiquarian, church historian, and cleric - served as president of St. Patrick's from 1845 through 1857. Under Renehan, many of the college's most important buildings were constructed by <a>Augustus Pugin</a>.</p>
<p>The museum in Maynooth College contains many items from the college's history, including ecclesiastical artifacts and scientific apparatus such as that of famous Physicist <a>Nicholas Callan</a>. Nicholas Callan figure in the study of electromagnetism, inventing the <a>Induction Coil</a> and <em>Maynooth Battery</em>. Callan is buried in the college grounds.</p>
<h3>Maynooth Grant</h3>
<p>Following the controversy regarding the <a>Maynooth Grant</a>, the College received a higher annual grant from the British Government, as well as a sum for repairs. In 1845, the British government under <a>Robert Peel</a> increased the annual grant to Maynooth College from &#x00a3;9,000 to &#x00a3;26,000, and provided a capital grant of &#x00a3;30,000 for building extensions again this was controversial from both Roman Catholics who saw it as a bribe, and Protestants who were not in favour of the government funding Roman Catholic education.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the <a>Catholic University of Ireland</a>, and later offered <a>Royal University of Ireland</a> degrees in arts and science. Even after the granting of the Pontifical Charter in 1896 the college became a <em>recognised college</em> of the <a>National University of Ireland</a> in 1910, and from this time its arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland. However during this time the Pontifical University of Maynooth continued to confer its degrees, as theology degrees were prohibited in the Royal University of Ireland, and its successor the National University of Ireland until 1997.</p>
<p>In 1966 after a gap of nearly 150 years lay students entered the college again, these being the members of lay <a>religious order</a>s, and in 1968 all <a>laity</a> where accepted; by 1977 they outnumbered religious. Finally in 1997 the <a>Universities Act, 1997</a> was passed by the <a>Oireachtas</a>. Chapter IX of the Act provided for the creation of the separate <a>National University of Ireland, Maynooth</a>. This new university was created from the college's <a>faculties</a> of Arts, Celtic Studies and Philosophy, and Science.</p>
<p>In 1994, W J Smyth, BA, PhD, LLD, was appointed to the position of Master of St. Patrick's College Maynooth(NUI). In 1997 this position became President of NUIM. After his 10-year term ended in 2004, he was replaced by Professor John Hughes as president of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p>

<h2>Governance of Maynooth College</h2>
<p>From its foundation 1795 Maynooth had been governed by a board of Clerical (the catholic bishops of Ireland) and lay trustees appointed by the government. The lay trustees were prominent Catholic Lords, such as the <a>Earl of Fingall</a> Arthur James Plunkett and the <a>Lord Chancellor of Ireland</a>. One of the side effects of the act to disestablish the Church of Ireland, was that Maynooth's governance and funding changed, leaving only the Bishops on the board of trustees.(Vic., C.25)</p>

<p> In its early years, Maynooth was involved in many controversies with the Government, initially over the education of Catholics, then over funding and the influence or otherwise perceived to accrue to being beholden to the English government. Since Irish Independence the converse would be somewhat through as to the influence of Maynooth and its trained clergy in the Irish Society, Maynooth would have been seen as being the venue of power of the clergy since the bishops held their conferences there. The foundation of the NUI also excluded members of Maynooth from its governing body as to limit the control of the Clergy over education.</p>
<h3>Oath of Allegiance</h3>
<p>As part of the bill on which Maynooth College was founded students and trustees of the college were supposed to take an Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown, this was part of the reason why some clerical students would not attend since the perceived sponsor by a foreign government, or pledging allegiance to a Protestant Head of state and head of the Anglican church. The Oath was evaded by many of the students, some feigning sickness, some repeating the words improperly, and others exercising a mental reservation but all treat it lightly.</p>
<h3>The Famine</h3>
<p>Maynooth College seemed to fare quite well during famine times with only one death reported. The good agricultural land and revenue acquired helped the college, and as a result many ordinary people resented their apparent prosperity whilst most of the country was devastated by potato blight and starvation.</p>
<h3>Michael O'Hickey</h3>
<p>Irish language activist and scholar Dr. <a>Michael O'Hickey</a>(1860&#x2013;1916) was dismissed in 1909 from his position as Professor of Irish, for his conduct in the controversy over Irish as a matriculation subject for the new <a>National University of Ireland</a>. He was supported by such Maynooth figures as College President <a>Daniel Mannix</a> and Professor of Theology <a>Walter McDonald</a> (1854&#x2013;1920).  </p>
<p>In 'An Linn Bhu&#x00ed;' the Irish language journal of Co Waterford, Dr O'Hickey's home county, M&#x00ed;che&#x00e1;l Briody, Lecturer at The Languages Centre, Helsinki University, Finland, shows us that Dr O'Hickey was a prominent member of The Gaelic League and fiercely in favour of compulsory Irish for the new University of Ireland, whereas Dr Mannix who was then President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth, together with most of the Catholic bishops, was opposed.   This was the cause of Dr O'Hickey's sacking.   As Briody points out, the Senate of the new University one year after Dr O'Hickey's sacking, agreed to Irish being compulsory for matriculation and not long after that Dr Mannix was posted as Archbishop to Melbourne, Australia,  against his own will.   Mannix however, later became a strong supporter of Irish Republicanism and something of a thorn in the side of the authorities both ecclesiastical and civil, in Australia as well as Britain.</p>
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>Any student of the college, prior to the passing of the Universities Act, 1997, upon whom a degree of the National University of Ireland was conferred is now legally considered to be a graduate of the <a>National University of Ireland, Maynooth</a>. The college continues to share its campus with National University of Ireland, Maynooth but remains a separate legal entity with training in canon law, philosophy and theology and awards the degrees of the Pontifical University and is associated with several other colleges.</p>
<p>In 2010 the college had 73 resident seminarians and a small number of non-resident seminarians travelling in by day for lectures. There are approximately 82 post-graduate students of theology and 250 undergraduate philosophy and theology students who are registered as full time students of the college. Up to 100 further students are registered on courses validated by the college including permanent diaconate programmes and partnership programmes with the National Liturgy Institute, ACCORD, Kairos and others. A further 8 Irish seminarians currently study in St. Malachy's Seminary in Belfast (the only other Catholic seminary in Ireland) and maintain close links with their counterparts in Maynooth.</p>
