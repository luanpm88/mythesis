<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>center|700px</a></p>
<h3>Maryland State Normal School</h3>
<p>[[Image:TUNewell.jpg|right|thumb|[[McFadden Newell|McFadden Alexander Newell]]|125px]] The <a>Maryland Legislature</a> established what would become Towson University in 1865, with the allocation of funds directed toward Maryland&#x2019;s first teacher-training school, or <a>normal school</a>. On January 15, 1866, this institution, known as the Maryland State Normal School (MSNS), officially opened its doors. Located then at Red Man's Hall in <a>Baltimore</a>, the school originally enrolled eleven students and fostered three faculty members. <a>McFadden Alexander Newell</a> served as the school's first principal as well as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and oversaw the first graduating class of sixteen students in June 1886. The following year, the General Assembly appropriated money to construct an exclusive building to house the burgeoning school. In 1876, the school moved its faculty and 206 students to this new facility located in West Baltimore on Carrollton &amp; Lafayette Street. and the Maryland State Department of Education. For 2007, Towson accepted about 69% of their applicants and had a yield rate of 29%. The average <a>grade point average</a> was a 3.45 and the middle 50% of matriculating students had <a>ACT</a> composite scores between 20-24. Towson educates undergraduate and graduate students in thirty academic departments which are subdivided into eight colleges:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The university provides 64 undergraduate majors, 37 master's degree programs and 4 doctoral programs. Once students have determined a program of study, they become a member of the academic college administering the program.</p>
<p>As a side note, Towson also has a <a>gerontology program</a> which is one of only 100 undergraduate programs offered in the United States. They're also the only public university in the United States that offers an undergraduate degree in <a>e-Business</a>.</p>
<h2>Enrollment</h2>
<p>More than 20,000 full-time and part-time students are enrolled in the University. Their numbers include over 800 international students from 100 nations. There are more than 15,000 undergraduates; approximately 13% are non-white. Also, in 2006 Towson achieved more enrollment in its business school than any college in the state of Maryland.</pre>
<h2>Student life</h2>

<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>About 77% of the freshman class, and over 4,400 students among all four classes, reside on campus. The University has 15 residence halls, which include apartment complexes, modern high-rise towers, and more traditional two- and three-story residential buildings. Students can also choose from five special housing options on campus, including: International House, Honors College, Wellness, Alcohol-free, and Special Quiet. While on campus, students have access to a counseling center, an academic advising center, a health center, and a career center.</p>
<h3>OneCard</h3>
<p><a>150px|left|thumb|An example of a OneCard</a> Students get access to their meal plan, dorm buildings, and computer labs through the use of their <a>OneCard</a>. They can also go to all of the school sporting events (which are many times free of charge to students) and several on campus events with the use of their card. It also serves dually as identification on campus.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>TU has its own on campus shuttle system that operates free of charge to students. The on-campus shuttle travels to most sections of the school, while the off-campus shuttles travel to more remote parts of TU, including some housing complexes (University Village) that students live in that are on the outskirts of the campus.  There is also direct access to the <a>MTA Maryland</a> buses with services connecting to the <a>light rail</a>.</p>
<h3>Towson UnPlugged</h3>
<p><a>right</a> Towson Unplugged is one of the largest wireless networks in the Baltimore metro area, and spans the campus&#x2019;  including residence halls.</p>
<p>The value of the updated wired network and new wireless network is $3.2 million. Wireless coverage extends across majority of the size of the TU campus, including 28 academic and administrative buildings that are wireless with approximately 400 access points in those buildings, with each access point having a range of .</p>
<p>TU Unplugged uses <a>802.11 b/g standard</a> <a>Wi-Fi</a> protocols with 11 Mbit/s is the approximate shared connection speed for Towson Unplugged users with 802.11b wireless adapters and 54 Mbit/s is the approximate shared connection speed for Towson Unplugged users with 802.11 g <a>wireless networking</a>.</p>
<p>On April 11, 2007, <a>Baltimore County</a> officials announced that they may provide wireless internet access throughout the county. However, they will first pilot the program in the <a>Towson</a> area, using donated bandwidth from Towson University to send signals to the Towson area.</p>
<h3>Campus Police</h3>
<p>The Towson University Police Department (TUPD) is the primary law enforcement agency servicing the students, faculty, and visitors within the campus limits and adjacent streets and roadways. The TUPD is aided by the <a>Baltimore County Police Department</a> as directed by authority. The current chief of police is Bernard Gerst. The TUPD is divided into several units such as the Patrol Unit and the Community Crime Reduction Unit. It also includes emergency communications.</p>

<h3>Campus Master Plan</h3>
<p>As a response to the University System of Maryland&#x2019;s (USM) desire for Towson University to grow its enrollment, a new Campus Master Plan was developed for the university and approved by the USM, Board of Regents in December 2003. The university found that in the past, it has been guided by master plans that focused inward, resulting in disjointed campus development that was disconnected from the larger Towson community.</p>
<p>The resulting vision, called <em>TU:2010</em>. addresses both <a>University System of Maryland</a> requirements and community concerns. It contains over 70 specific initiatives that range from growing diversity to increasing student involvement in service learning projects. Perhaps its most visible development is the creation of academic and student life buildings, as well as roads, parking, utilities and landscapes to support those buildings.</p>
<p>As part of this vision, Towson's campus is undergoing many construction projects set into different phases with staggered completion dates. </p>

<h3>Campus Sustainability</h3>
<p>Towson University is committed to social and environmental responsibility. The school is achieving this goal by promoting recycling initiatives and green dining. Students partake in &#x201c;Trayless Tuesdays&#x201d; and receive incentives for using reusable mugs. Sustainability has also been incorporated into first year orientation so that students can begin a dialogue on environmental stewardship in their daily lives. Towson looks forward to having its initiatives analyzed for the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card.</p>
<h3>Towson Tiger</h3>
<p><a>right</a>  Before the 1960s, the name of the sports teams at Towson were known as the &quot;Towson College Knights&quot;. Towson student <a>John Schuerholz</a> pushed for a new mascot, and the tiger was officially adopted in 1962. Schuerholz later became general manager of the <a>Atlanta Braves</a> and is the team's president as of 2008. The university's present baseball complex is named in his honor.</p>
<p>According to school newspaper <em><a>The Towerlight</a></em>, when the Student Government Association first bought the tiger statue that sits outside Cook Library in 1996, the organization hoped to boost school spirit. Instead, it became subject to vandalism and disrepair. In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from in front of the library.</p>
<p>In September 2006, the Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university's &quot;Capital Campaign&quot; to raise $50 million dollars. The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won't get damaged by vandals.</p>
<p>The new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007 where Caret said it would be  &quot;visible to passersby on York Road as well as students&quot;.</p>
<h3>A President's Blog</h3>
<p>Towson University is one of the first colleges in the United States to have a president who has his own <a>blog</a> and <a>podcast</a>.. Robert Caret created the blog and  podcast to convey different messages to TU students.</p>
<h3>Smoke Free Campus</h3>
<p>Towson is the first four year institution in Maryland to enact a campus-wide smoke-free policy starting August 1, 2010. All Towson University buildings and exterior grounds are now designated as non-smoking areas.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Towson's club Rugby team in action, October 2005.</a> The <a>Towson Tigers</a>, formerly the Towson College Knights, are the athletics teams of Towson University. All of the major athletic teams compete in the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a> with 20 Division I athletic teams (13 in women's sports, 7 in men's sports).</p>
<p>Under the leadership of President Bob Caret the University has placed a greater emphasis on the athletics program.  In September 2010 Caret hired a new Director of Athletics, Michael P. Waddell, who has significant program building experience at the highest levels of college sports.  </p>
<p>Towson University offers the most comprehensive sports program in the metropolitan Baltimore area, fielding 20 varsity teams that compete in the Colonial Athletic Association. Since joining the league in 2001-02, the Tigers have won CAA titles in men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lacrosse, women&#x2019;s swimming, men&#x2019;s soccer and men&#x2019;s golf. During an athletics history that traces its roots to the 1920&#x2019;s, Towson has sent teams and individual student-athletes to NCAA post-season competition in baseball, basketball, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, track &amp; field and volleyball. </p>
<p>Tiger student-athletes have distinguished themselves in the classroom as well as on the field of competition. Eleven Tigers have been named CAA Scholar-Athlete Award Winners for their respective sports, including the 2010 cross country recipient, Brandi Gervais, a senior Biology/Pre-Dentistry Major with a perfect 4.0 GPA. A number of student-athletes have gone on to enjoy professional careers, including most recently Jermon Bushrod, the starting left offensive tackle for the 2010 Super Bowl Champion New Orleans Saints; outfielder Casper Wells with the Detroit Tigers; and shooting guard Gary Neal with the San Antonio Spurs. </p>
<p>In May 2011, the department will break ground on the future of Towson Athletics as it begins construction of Tiger Arena, a new 5000-seat, state-of-the-art arena for basketball, volleyball and gymnastics, slated to open in the Spring of 2013.</p>
<p>Towson has drawn considerable attention for its 11 time National Champion Dance Team. Every year the team travels to <a>Daytona Beach, Florida</a> to compete in the <a>National Dance Association</a> College Nationals in D1 Division. The team won their eleventh consecutive title in April 2009.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>Tigerfest</h3>
<p>Tigerfest is TU's annual spring festival that features interactive activities for students, as well as live musical entertainment. Tigerfest, which is also open to the public (not just TU students), occurs in late April and is held on Burdick Field. The event has become increasingly popular throughout its history, mainly because mainstream music acts headline Tigerfest each year. <a>The Roots</a>, <a>Immortal Technique</a>, and <a>Alex Band</a> of <a>The Calling</a> performed at the  2008 Tigerfest on April 26. Artists such as <a>Third Eye Blind</a>, <a>Dashboard Confessional</a>, <a>The Used</a>, and <a>Yellowcard</a> have appeared at Tigerfest in the past. The 2009 Tigerfest featured <a>The All-American Rejects</a> as the headliner. The concert also featured <a>Shiny Toy Guns</a>, <a>Vedera</a>, and <a>Ace Enders</a> as opening acts.<a>N.E.R.D.</a> headlined the 2010 festival and only played 50 minutes of their 90 minute set for a crowd of 5,000 people.</p>
<h2>Community Outreach</h2>
<h3>Division of Economic and Community Outreach</h3>
<p>Towson University, Maryland&#x2019;s Metropolitan University, is committed to addressing education, economic development and broad social issues. To further Towson&#x2019;s role as a premier metropolitan university, the Division of Economic and Community Outreach (DECO) was established in 2004 as an initiative of President Robert L. Caret. DECO&#x2019;s charge is to provide a focus for engagement with the external community and to provide a path into the university's research and project talent. DECO includes over 130 experts in the following areas: IT Solutions, Mapping Solutions (GIS), Technical Training, Applied Economics and Human Services, Information Assurance, and Business Growth.</p>
<h3>The Cherry Hill Learning Zone</h3>
<p>The initiative is a partnership among the <a>Baltimore City Public School System</a>, Baltimore City government, Towson University and Cherry Hill's community organizations. Together, the programs are trying to rebuild the Cherry Hill neighborhood in southern Baltimore. The program interacts with Cherry Hill&#x2019;s civic leaders, community organizations and citizens, the Learning Zone hopes to serve as a resource for the academic progress of Cherry Hill&#x2019;s young residents and improvement of the overall environment in the community.</p>
<h3>Baltimore Urban Debate League</h3>
<p> The <a>Towson Speech and Debate</a> team has close ties with the <a>Baltimore Urban Debate League</a> and often volunteers people from the team and the university to judge and facilitate the running of the tournaments.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: <a>right|200px</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>The university often acts as a host for league tournaments at least once a year.</p>
<p>Towson also has what they call an <em>Urban Debate Scholar</em> award that they give to one graduating senior every year. The scholarship pays for full tuition and fees at TU. They also offer varying awards between $2,000 - $4,000 to other graduating seniors.</p>
<h3>Adopt-A-Campus</h3>
<p>President Caret has also established a program called <em>Adopt-A-Campus</em>, which gives local businesses, organizations and others an opportunity to help beautify the TU campus. Every group will be assigned a certain section of the campus, and will be encouraged to pick up litter and help keep the area clean of trash and debris.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<h3>Free Speech policy</h3>
<p>The school newspaper, <em><a>The Towerlight</a></em>, announced that in February 2008, the school administration was planning to implement a &quot;Free Speech Policy&quot;. Within the policy, it defines several things that would be considered <a>free speech</a>, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests. This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;. Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels it is a mistake to exclude students from the decision making process&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;. It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the <em>Student Leadership Council</em> that consists of student leaders who are in charge of very large student groups. Several of the students contested that not only did they not know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not even know that kind of committee even existed.</p>
<p>The administration is currently reworking the policy and will rename it the <em>Time, Place and Manner policy</em>.&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpeechPolicy&quot;/&gt;</p>
