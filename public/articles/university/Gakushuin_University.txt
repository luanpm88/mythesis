<p> is an elite higher educational institution in Mejiro, <a>Toshima</a>, <a>Tokyo</a>. It was re-established after <a>World War II</a> as an affiliate of the <a>Gakush&#x016b;in</a> School Corporation, the privatized successor to the original Gakush&#x016b;in University or &quot;Peers School&quot; set up during the <a>Meiji era</a> to educate the children of the <a>Japanese nobility</a>. The Gakush&#x016b;in University is still one of the most prestigious universities in Japan, having most of the members of the present <a>Imperial Family</a> as former, present, or future students. The average number of students has been kept low so that each one can receive personal attention from the staff.</p>
<p>The level of the academic staff (professors, lecturers, etc.) is considered to be equal to that of the staff of the famous <a>University of Tokyo</a>. Although the outlook of Gakush&#x016b;in is traditional, the education given there is extremely liberal, and the prevailing atmosphere is one of comradeship, toleration and broad-mindedness.</p>
<p>This freedom of thought, combined with a lack of competition between students, has resulted in the fact that there are many well-known literary figures, artists, and diplomats among the alumni. However, despite the high academic level, research work conducted at the University has not received much public attention, so that it is not well known outside of Japan. As virtually all the instruction is conducted in Japanese, there are relatively few foreigners at Gakush&#x016b;in.   </p>
