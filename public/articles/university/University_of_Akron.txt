<p>        <strong>The University of Akron</strong> is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Akron, Ohio</a>, part of the University System of Ohio.  It was founded in 1870 as a small college affiliated with the <a>Universalist Church</a>. In 1913 ownership was transferred to the City of <a>Akron</a>. In 1967 the university became a state institution. The University of Akron is regarded as a world leader in <a>polymer</a> research. As a <a>STEM</a>-focused institution, it focuses on industries such as polymers, advanced materials, and engineering. In the last decade it has sought to increase its research portfolio and gain recognition for its productivity in technology transfer and commercialization. </p>
<p>The University recently underwent a $300 million construction project, which added nine new buildings and renovated fourteen, and closed several streets. A new football stadium, <a>InfoCision Stadium-Summa Field</a>, was constructed on campus as a replacement for the University's previous stadium, the <a>Rubber Bowl</a>. The school offers more than 200 <a>undergraduate</a> and more than 100 <a>graduate</a> majors. Total enrollment was 29,251 students in Fall 2010, with students representing 46 U.S. states and 80 foreign countries, making Akron the third-largest main campus in Ohio. The University's best-known program is its College of <a>Polymer</a> Science and Polymer Engineering, which is located in a 13-story reflective glass building that overlooks the western edge of the campus. The <a>Archives of the History of American Psychology</a> are located in the Polsky Building, one which used to house Polsky's Department Store. The university has two branch campuses, <a>Wayne College</a>, located in <a>Orrville, Ohio</a>, and the <a>Medina County University Center</a>, located in <a>Lafayette Township, Ohio</a>.  In addition, the University hosts various nursing programs in affiliation with Lorain County Community College under the University Partnership program.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:JohnBuchtel.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[John R. Buchtel]], in front of Buchtel Hall]]</p>
<h3>Buchtel College</h3>
<p>In 1867, at the annual Convention of the <a>Universalist Church</a> of the state of Ohio, the Committee on Education expressed an interest in founding a college compatible with Universalist religious principles.  It was announced that the location would be given to those who could find an appropriate location and also supply $60,000 for the college.  <a>John R. Buchtel</a>, a prominent Akron businessman and Universalist, promptly contributed $25,000 to the endowment fund and $6,000 to the building fund.  This led other Akronites to donate, setting the goal and securing Akron as the location for Buchtel College, named after its greatest supporter.  John R. Buchtel would continue to be the college's most significant contributor, giving $500,000 over his lifetime, approximately equivalent to $9 million today.  When the university opened for business in 1872 it was a single building campus, housed in what is now known as &quot;Old Buchtel.&quot; <a>George Washington Crouse</a> donated $10,000 of the $20,000 needed to build a new gymnasium, completed in 1888.  It was named Crouse Gymnasium in his honor, and was known as &quot;the finest gym west of the Alleghenies.&quot;</p>
<p>Tragedy struck the small college on December 20, 1899, when Old Buchtel burned to the ground.  Insurance only covered $65,000 of the estimated $100,000 in loss.  While new campus buildings were being constructed, the Crouse Gymnasium was divided into seven classrooms and served as the college until a new Buchtel Hall was opened in 1901. The new Buchtel Hall, which itself was gutted by fire in 1971, survives to this day but still has some blackening on the exterior.</p>
<h3>20th century</h3>
<p>In 1907, the college shed its Universalist affiliation and became a non-denominational institution, in order to be able to receive funds from the Carnegie Foundation, which would not give funds to religiously affiliated schools.  In 1913, Buchtel College trustees transferred the institution and its assets to the city of <a>Akron</a>, and Buchtel College became the Municipal University of Akron.  At this time, the enrollment was 198 students.  Tax money levied for the school and Akron's growing population led to strong growth for the university.  Over the next several decades the university continued add new buildings to accommodate its growing student population, acquiring more land through purchases and donations.  In 1963, Ohio Governor <a>Jim Rhodes</a> approved the university as a state-assisted institution.  Enrollment in 1964 was 10,000 students. In 1967, it fully became a state university, giving it its current name of The University of Akron.</p>
<h3>Recent expansion</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px| University of Akron's Student union at night</a> A $300 million <a>construction</a> program was completed in the fall of 2004. Called &quot;A New Landscape for Learning,&quot; the program included the construction of nine new buildings, the renovations or updating of 14 other buildings and structures, and numerous capital improvement projects. The New Landscape for Learning included a new College of Arts &amp; Sciences Building, Honors Residence Hall and classroom complex, a new Student Recreation and Wellness Center, and a new Student Union. Multiple new parking decks were constructed to address high demand for parking (placed on the outskirts of campus in accordance with the university's goal to be less of a commuter school), and several public streets were closed to consolidate the campus, provide a more friendly environment for pedestrians and to add 30 acres (120,000 m&#x00b2;) of new greenspace.</p>
<p>The University opened on a satellite campus in neighboring <a>Medina County</a> and is shopping around ideas for workforce centers in the suburbs.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2007, the University's Board of Trustees announced that a new stadium, <a>Infocision Stadium</a>, on East Exchange Street, would open in September 2009, with groundbreaking in October 2007.  The stadium has a capacity of 30,000 and replaced UA's former stadium, the <a>Rubber Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>The University purchased the <a>Quaker Square Crowne Plaza Hotel</a> and shopping complex in downtown Akron, using half of the rooms as residence space and the other as a working hotel. The University did a land-swap with the city of Akron so that the city may find a new hotel for the Central Business District.</p>
<p>The University of Akron campus is made up of 82 buildings on  near downtown Akron with a total property value of $1.84 billion.</p>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<h3>Polymers</h3>
<p>The tire and rubber industry and the University of Akron share an intimate history.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>[[File:Goodyear Polymer Center.jpg|right|thumb|200px| The [[Goodyear Polymer Center]] on the University of Akron campus]] The University of Akron produced more revenue in technology licensing in 2007 than any other year in its history, bringing in $6.33 million - more than all other Ohio public universities.  This licensing amount gives UA a ranking of seventh in the nation among public and private U.S. universities without medical schools, just behind such notables as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology and the University of Texas. When normalized with respect to research expenditures, UA ranks No. 1 in the country. This is the first time UA has achieved a top national standing in licensing efficiency.  A 2007 report supported by the National Science Foundation identified UA as one of 10 exemplars for technology transfer, commercialization and industry partnership.</p>
