<p><a>thumb|200px|right|First ESSEC Graduates, class of 1909.</a></p>
<p>ESSEC's flagship postgraduate programme is its Master of Science in Management, designed for students with no professional experience (instead of managers with 3&#x2013;5 years of experience like US or UK <a>MBA</a> programs). The diploma is only delivered upon completion of a required amount of time spent in internships.</p>
<h4>Admission process</h4>
<p>Along with HEC Paris, ESSEC is one of the two top schools among the Business <em><a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em>, and as such it requires passing a selective entrance examination, the &quot;Concours Grandes Ecoles&quot;.</p>
<p>It takes place between May and June. Every year, ESSEC recruits about 360 students through this examination process. Most of the students who sit for the entrance examination come from the French &#x201c;<a>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a>&#x201d;, also called &#x201c;classes pr&#x00e9;pa&#x201d;. The &#x201c;classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires&#x201d; last two years and their only purpose is to prepare students for the French Business Schools&#x2019; selective entrance examination.</p>
<p>ESSEC, along with many other business schools, tests the candidates on their knowledge in mathematics, economics, history, philosophy, general culture and languages. The candidates must also pass a series of oral exams in order to enter the school.</p>
<p> Many students in &quot;classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires&quot; choose not to pass the ESSEC exam because they consider it is too difficult. There are approximately 16,000 undergraduate students who follow this academic training known as &quot;pr&#x00e9;pa &#x00e9;conomiques et commerciales&quot;.</p>
