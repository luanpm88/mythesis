<p><strong>Southern Methodist University</strong> (<strong>SMU</strong>) is a private university in University Park, Texas (an enclave of Dallas, Texas). Founded in 1911 by the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>, SMU operates campuses in University Park, <a>Plano</a>, and <a>Taos, New Mexico</a>. SMU is owned by the South Central Jurisdiction of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>.  6,000 of the University's 11,000 students are undergraduates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was chartered on <a>April 17</a>, 1911 by the five <a>Annual Conference</a>s in Texas of the <a>United Methodist Church</a>. Classes were originally planned to start in 1913 but were postponed until 1915.</p>
<p>SMU was established as the unsuccessful attempt to relocate <a>Southwestern University</a> from <a>Georgetown, Texas</a> to either Fort Worth or Dallas. The first relocation effort by <a>Polytechnic College</a> president <a>Hiram A. Boaz</a> and spearheaded by Southwestern president <a>Robert Stewart Hyer</a> involved merging Southwestern with Polytechnic College (now Texas Wesleyan University). The post-merger university would retain the Southwestern name while occupying Polytechnic's campus in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>The merger never came to fruition, primarily because the Dallas Chamber of Commerce set up a committee to raise funds and entice Southwestern to relocate to Dallas. This proposal gained considerable traction since Southwestern was operating a medical school in Dallas. Plans were drawn for the campus's first building, Memorial Hall, which inspired SMU's first building, Dallas Hall. Southwestern's trustees rejected the relocation plan, prompting Hyer's resignation and move to Dallas to establish Southern Methodist University.</p>
<p>SMU retained close connections to Southwestern and Polytechnic. Southwestern president Hyer became SMU's first president. Hiram A. Boaz, a Southwestern graduate, resigned as president of Polytechnic to become SMU's second president. Polytechnic attempted to become a feeder school of SMU before becoming a women's college. SMU acquired Southwestern's medical school in Dallas and operated it until 1915. Southwestern and SMU were athletic rivals until Southwestern became a small liberal arts college.</p>
<p>The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the <a>General Conference</a> of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new <a>connectional institution</a> in the wake of a 1914 <a>Tennessee Supreme Court</a> decision stripping the church of authority at <a>Vanderbilt University</a>. The church decided to support the establishment of SMU and dramatically increase the size of <a>Emory University</a> at a new location in <a>DeKalb County, Georgia</a>. At the 1914 meeting of the General Conference, SMU was designated the connectional institution for all <a>Conferences</a> west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>Classes were planned to officially begin in 1913, but construction delays on the university's first building prevented classes from starting until 1915. In the interim, the only functioning academic department at SMU was the medical college it had acquired from Southwestern University.</p>
<p>SMU named its first building Dallas Hall in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university's location. Dallas Hall remains the university's symbol and centerpiece.  Designed by <a>Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge</a> after the Rotunda at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, Dallas Hall opened its doors in 1915 and housed the entire university as well as a bank and a barbershop. Dallas Hall is registered in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. SMU's nickname &quot;The Hilltop&quot; was inspired by Dallas Hall, which was built on a hill.</p>
<p>The university's first president, Robert Stewart Hyer, selected <a>Harvard crimson</a> and <a>Yale blue</a> as the school colors in order to associate SMU with the high standards of ivy league universities. Several streets in <a>University Park</a> were named after prominent universities, including <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Purdue</a>, <a>Tulane</a>, <a>Amherst</a>, <a>Bryn Mawr</a>, <a>Drexel</a>, <a>Hanover</a>, <a>Marquette</a>, <a>Southwestern</a>, <a>Vassar</a>, and <a>Villanova</a>.</p>
<p>In 1939, SMU was placed under the South Central Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>The university drew considerable media attention in 1987 when the <a>NCAA</a> administered the <a>death penalty</a> against the SMU football program for repeated, flagrant recruiting violations. The punishment included cancellation of the 1987 and most of the 1988 football season and a two year ban from Bowl Games and all televised sports coverage.</p>
<p>In 2008, SMU was selected as the site of the <a>George W. Bush Presidential Library</a> and the George W. Bush Policy Institute.</li>

<h3>George W. Bush Presidential Center</h3>
<p>On February 22, 2008, the University trustees unanimously instructed President <a>R. Gerald Turner</a> to enter into an agreement to establish the <a>George W. Bush Presidential Center</a> on the southeast side of the campus. SMU has courted Bush&mdash;whose wife, <a>Laura</a>, is an alumna&mdash;ever since <a>Ray Lee Hunt</a> broached the subject with the President a few months after Bush assumed office. The museum will be joined by the George W. Bush Institute.</p>
<p>Laura Bush and project architect <a>Robert A.M. Stern</a> unveiled the center's final design on November 18, 2009, on the SMU campus. Budgeted at $250 million, the  complex will include a museum, library, archive and private Policy Institute. The building will be constructed of Texas limestone and red brick with a central landmark tower to blend with SMU's <a>Georgian Revival</a> architecture, and will look out onto a rolling terrain of native Texas wildflowers and grasses designed by landscape architect <a>Michael Van Valkenburgh</a>.</p>
<p>Specifications sent to prospective architects in June 2007 called for a  library and a  institute to be built in an area bordered by SMU Boulevard to the north, Central Expressway to the east, Mockingbird Lane to the south and Airline Road and Dublin Street to the west.  The specifications called for the buildings to comply with SMU's &quot;distinct architectural character.&quot;</p>
<p>The library and museum will be administered by the <a>National Archives and Records Administration</a> while the institute will be privately maintained.  The university will have representation on the Institute board.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Doak Walker Award</a>, an annual collegiate award given to the &quot;most outstanding college running back&quot;, is named after SMU <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a>Doak Walker</a>.</li>
  <li>The SMU football program has also produced many professional football standouts, such as <a>Don Meredith</a>, <a>Doak Walker</a>, <a>Kyle Rote</a>, <a>Eric Dickerson</a>, <a>Jerry Ball</a>, and <a>Craig James</a>. Four Mustangs are active in the National Football League: cornerback Kevin Garrett (<a>Carolina Panthers</a>), defensive back <a>Bryan McCann</a> (<a>Dallas Cowboys</a>), defensive back <a>Alvin Nnabuife</a> (<a>Green Bay Packers</a>), defensive end <a>Justin Rogers</a>, who was selected in the sixth round of the <a>2007 NFL Draft</a> by the <a>New England Patriots</a> and now plays for the Dallas Cowboys, and kicker Thomas Morstead was drafted by the <a>New Orleans Saints</a> in 2009.</li>
  <li>From 1980&ndash;1985 SMU had one of the winningest programs in Division I-A (now FBS). They posted a record of 55-14-1, and finished these seasons ranked #21, #7, #2, #19, and #8 in the nation.</li>
  <li>On February 25, 1987 the <a>NCAA</a> administered the <a>&quot;death penalty&quot;</a> for <a>repeated, flagrant recruiting violations</a>.  Components included cancellation of the entire 1987 season, a two-year ban from bowl appearances, a two-year ban from television appearances, a limit of seven games, all on road, in the 1988 season, a loss of three assistant coaching positions for two years and a loss of 55 new scholarships over four years. Players were allowed to transfer without sitting out one season, per standard requirement.  SMU responded to the combination of these conditions by canceling the 1988 season outright.</pre>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Celebration of Lights</strong> - This winter tradition is a candlelit ceremony of songs and readings, held each December. The SMU community gathers on the Main Quad of the campus for this popular event. Traditionally, the <a>Christmas</a> story is read from the <a>Bible</a> by the University's president. Those who attend sing Christmas carols led by choirs from the Meadows School of the Arts and nearby high schools. The Christmas lights that decorate Dallas Hall and the surrounding trees are lit during this time.</li>
  <li><strong>Mustang Corral</strong> - This retreat in the Texas Hill Country is for entering first-year students. Student leaders, alumni, faculty, and staff welcome new students to the SMU community while sharing the rich history of spirit and traditions. Students meet professors, get to know each other, perform skits, and learn the school's cheers. They also compete in various events such as tug-of-war, sponge racing, and water balloon throwing in a camp-wide event known as The Olympics. The team that wins the Olympics receives the coveted Golden Rake.</li>
  <li><strong>Red and Blue Fridays</strong> - On the Friday before football games, SMU students wear red or blue shirts to show their support for the team. On game days, students and fans wear red. In the past, the University has sold an &quot;official game day shirt&quot;, which is always red and usually features a clever saying or play on words relating to SMU's mascot, the Mustang.</li>
  <li><strong><a>The Mustang Band</a></strong> - The <a>SMU marching band</a> was the first band to play <a>jazz</a> music on a <a>football field</a> beginning in the 1930s. From 1959 forward, the band's instrumentation was designed to mimic that of a <a>jazz band</a>, consisting only of <a>brass instruments</a>, <a>drums</a>, and <a>saxophones</a>.  And, the band began to use actual <a>jazz</a> arrangements instead of imitation <a>jazz</a> pieces written specifically for <a>marching bands</a>.  The band has a unique uniform style (coat and tie) which evolves over each season.  The band wears different combinations of uniform parts for the first half of the game, switching or adding parts for the second half, and not repeating any of these combinations for the entire season.  The available parts include: coat (red, or blue), vest (red or blue), button-down shirt (white or blue), pants (white, blue, or khaki), and long tie (red or blue).</li>

  <li><strong>Peruna</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Peruna is the official SMU fight song.  It is based on the classic tune &quot;She'll Be Comin' Around The Mountain&quot;.  While officially wordless, the fight song is sometimes sung in parody as &quot;She'll be loaded with Peruna when she comes&quot;.</p>
