<ul>
  <li><strong>Executive MBA</strong>. Around 300 business people take part in the London-based Executive MBA programme. The first year of the programme is taught on alternate Fridays and Saturdays in term-time. A number of week-long blocks are used for leadership skills, career management and international field trips. The second year consists of electives taught in London or at business schools overseas, an optional term or semester on exchange with a business school abroad, and a management report.</li>
  <li><strong>EMBA-Global Americas and Europe</strong>. A further 140 executives are enrolled in the dual-degree EMBA-Global Programme. It is taught in partnership with <a>Columbia Business School</a>, and is designed for fast-track executives able to demonstrate sustained management experience with an international focus. Graduates are awarded degrees from both universities. The first year involves week-long modules each month alternating between London and New York.

  <li><strong>EMBA-Global Asia</strong>. London Business School launched this programme in 2008 jointly with <a>Hong Kong University</a> and Columbia. Teaching takes place at all three business schools. While the first year is modelled on the transatlantic EMBA-Global, the school states that because &quot;EMBA-Global Asia is designed for people who have or will have significant trans-national responsibilities, all courses reflect a greater proportion of global material&quot;.</li>
  <li><strong>Dubai-London EMBA</strong>. This 17 to 20 month, dual campus programme began in September 2007. It has a similar structure to the EMBA-Global.
