<p>   <strong>Sarah Lawrence</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>independent</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> in the <a>United States</a>. It is located in southern <a>Westchester County</a>, <a>New York</a>, in the city of <a>Yonkers</a>,  north of <a>Manhattan</a>. Sarah Lawrence was founded in 1926 as a <a>women's college</a> and became a <a>coeducational</a> institution in 1968. The College is known for its rigorous academic standards and low student-to-faculty ratio of 9-to-1. Individual student-faculty tutorials patterned after the <a>Oxford/Cambridge system</a> are a key component of all areas of study. Sarah Lawrence emphasizes <a>scholarship</a>, particularly in the <a>humanities</a>, <a>performing arts</a>, and <a>writing</a>, and places a high value on independent study. In <em>The Best College for You</em>, a 2000 co-publication of <em><a>Time Magazine</a></em> and <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>, Sarah Lawrence College was named the liberal arts &quot;College of the Year&quot;, citing the school's strong emphasis on writing across the curriculum. It is currently the most expensive college in the <a>United States</a>, with annual tuition, <a>room and board</a>, and fees totaling $54,410 for the 2009/2010 school year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|upright|Sarah Lawrence</a> Sarah Lawrence College was established by <a>real-estate</a> <a>mogul</a> <a>William Van Duzer Lawrence</a> on the grounds of his <a>estate</a> in <a>Westchester County</a> and was named in honor of his wife, Sarah. The College was originally intended to provide instruction in the arts and humanities for women. A major component of the College's early curriculum was &quot;productive leisure,&quot; wherein students were required to work for eight hours weekly in such fields as <a>modeling</a>, <a>shorthand</a>, <a>typewriting</a>, applying <a>makeup</a>, and <a>gardening</a>. Its pedagogy, modeled on the tutorial system of <a>Oxford University</a>, combined independent research projects, individually supervised by the teaching faculty, and seminars with low student-to-faculty ratio&#x2014;a credo it retains to the present, despite its cost.  Sarah Lawrence was the first <a>liberal arts college</a> in the United States to incorporate a rigorous approach to the <a>arts</a> with the principles of <a>progressive education</a>, focusing on the primacy of <a>teaching</a> and the concentration of curricular efforts on individual needs.  During the so-called <a>McCarthy Years</a>, a number of Sarah Lawrence's faculty members were accused by the <a>American Legion</a> of being sympathetic to the <a>Communist Party</a>, and were called before the Jenner Committee. Since that time, activism has played a central role in student life, with movements for <a>civil rights</a> and against <a>the Vietnam War</a> in the 1960s and for student and faculty <a>diversity</a> in the 1980s. Also in the 1960s, students established an <a>Upward Bound</a> program for students from lower-income and poverty areas to prepare for college.  Theatre Outreach, the Child Development Institute, the <a>Empowering Teachers Program</a>, the Community Writers program, the Office of Community Partnership, and the Fulbright High School Writers Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community. In the late 1980s, students occupied Westlands, the main administrative building for the campus, in a sit-in for wider diversity. Students have remained active in recent years, with numerous organizations and movements sprouting in response to the <a>Iraq War</a>. For many years, the College has been considered as being at the vanguard of the <a>sexual rights</a> movement.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>At the <a>undergraduate</a> level, Sarah Lawrence offers a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in liberal arts where, instead of traditional <a>majors</a>, students pursue a wide variety of <a>courses</a> in four different curricular distributions: the Creative Arts (writing, music, dance, theatre, <a>film</a>, and the plastic arts, such as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture); history and the social sciences (e.g., <a>anthropology</a>, economics, political science, and sociology); the humanities (e.g., Asian studies, art history, film studies, languages, literature, philosophy, and religion); and natural science and mathematics (biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics). Classes are structured around a seminar-conference system through which students learn in small, highly interactive classes and in private tutorials with professors. Each student is assigned to a faculty advisor, known as a &quot;<a>don</a>,&quot; to plan a course of study and provide ongoing academic guidance.  Most courses, apart from those in the performing arts, consist of two parts: the <a>seminar</a>, limited to 15 students, and the conference, a private, biweekly meeting with a seminar <a>professor</a>.  In these conferences, students develop individual projects that extend the course material and link it to their personal interests.  Sarah Lawrence has no required courses and traditional <a>examinations</a> have largely been replaced with writing final <a>research papers</a> and essays.  Additionally, <a>grades</a> are recorded only for transcript purposes&#x2014;academic evaluations are given in lieu of grades. The College sponsors <a>international programs</a> in <a>Florence</a>, at <a>Wadham College</a>, <a>Oxford</a>, at <a>Reid Hall</a> in <a>Paris</a>, and at the British American Drama Academy in <a>London</a>.  Sarah Lawrence is one of the only American colleges operating an international program in <a>Cuba</a> .</p>
<p>Sarah Lawrence also offers <a>Master's-level</a> programs in <a>Writing</a>, the <a>Art of Teaching</a>, <a>Child Development</a>, <a>Theatre</a>, and <a>Dance</a>, and is home to the nation's oldest graduate program in <a>Women's History</a> and the nation's first master's degree programs in <a>Human Genetics</a> and Health Advocacy.</p>
<h3>Exchange programs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a>Reed College Exchange Program</a>: In 1994, Sarah Lawrence inaugurated an exchange program with Reed College in <a>Portland, Oregon</a>. This program enables SLC and Reed students to study on one another&#x2019;s campus for an academic semester or year. In order to qualify for the exchange program with Reed, students must have strong academic records and have completed the first and sophomore years. Qualified students also have the opportunity to participate in any one of either college&#x2019;s study-abroad programs.</li>
  <li><a>Eugene Lang College Exchange Program</a>: In 1996 the college began its exchange program with Eugene Lang College, the undergraduate division of the <a>New School</a> in New York City. Eugene Lang has particular strengths in the <a>social sciences</a>. Qualified students may cross register in courses in other divisions of the <a>New School</a>, including the graduate divisions. students must have strong academic records and have completed the first and sophomore years. Qualified students also have the opportunity to participate in Lang&#x2019;s exchange program at the <a>University of Amsterdam</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Spelman College Exchange Program</a>: Beginning in spring 2007, female SLC students began participating in an exchange program with Spelman College in <a>Atlanta, Georgia</a>.  Qualified students may also apply for the Spelman exchange with <a>Tsuda College for Women</a> in <a>Tokyo, Japan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International programs</h3>
<p>The College has a number of international programs in four countries.  Sarah Lawrence makes all practical efforts to preserve its most characteristic elements, such as one-on-one interaction with professors, small classes, and an emphasis on qualitative comprehension, in its programs overseas.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Havana</a>: This is the only formal American university program currently operating in <a>Cuba</a>. The course offerings at the University of Havana include Afro-Cuban culture, art history, Cuban or Latin American cinema, Cuban history, Latin American studies, literature, psychology, urban and rural sociology, U.S.-Cuban relations, and women&#x2019;s studies. All courses are taught by Cuban faculty and are attended by Cuban students. Each student is also required to enroll in an advanced Spanish course. The most distinctive feature is an affiliation with Centro de Estudios Demogr&#x00e1;ficos (CEDEM), one of the research centers at the University of Havana. At CEDEM students meet with experts whose research and professional expertise focus on developments in contemporary Cuban society. Students select a research topic and are paired with a professor from CEDEM with whom they meet on a regular basis, much like the regular conference structure.</li>
  <li><a>London</a>: Jointly sponsored by the British American Drama Academy and Sarah Lawrence College, the program expands Sarah Lawrence's long-standing and vibrant tradition in the performing arts by exposing students to the rigors of professional British training in acting . The faculty includes some of Britain&#x2019;s most distinguished actors and directors. The heart of each student&#x2019;s program is scene study in classical and modern works. Students also take courses in voice, movement, and stage fighting and participate in fully staged performances at the end of each term.</li>
  <li><a>Oxford</a>: Since 1985, Sarah Lawrence College has been associated with <a>Wadham College</a>, one of the undergraduate colleges of <a>Oxford University</a> in <a>England</a>. This program is open to select juniors and seniors. Students are best prepared to undertake the demands of Oxford if their course work in their first and sophomore years have included significant analytical and written work.</li>
  <li><a>Paris</a>: Centered at historic <a>Reid Hall</a> in the <a>Montparnasse</a> quarter of Paris, the program is Sarah Lawrence's oldest and focuses on the humanities and creative arts. The program is conducted entirely in French and includes one required French-language class and three other courses of the student&#x2019;s choosing. Classes may be taken at the University of Paris, Institut d&#x2019;Etudes Politiques, the Ecole du Louvre, and the Institut Catho-lique, or other, more specialized institutions.</li>
  <li><a>Catania</a>: Open to students who have an advanced comprehension of <a>Italian</a>, the Catania program takes advantage of its <a>Sicilian</a> setting to provide students with an experience in cultural immersion.  Students enroll directly at the University of Catania and choose courses offered by the Humanities department, including: Medieval History, Modern Italian Literature, History of Philosophy, Archaeology, Greek and Roman Art History, History of Theatrical Arts, Comparative Literature, Byzantine History, and the History of Europe.</li>
  <li><a>Florence</a>: Open to students at all levels of Italian-language comprehension, the Florence program is noted for its <a>art history</a> program.</li>
  <li><a>Dartington</a>: A highly competitive, music based exchange with <a>Dartington College of the Arts</a> in southern <a>England</a>. The program is open to qualified students with an interest in experimental music and media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graduate programs</h3>
<p>Sarah Lawrence offers eight graduate programs, each of which confers the <a>Master of Arts</a> or <a>Master of Science</a> degree upon its graduates.  In contrast to highly specialized, <a>research</a>-oriented <a>doctoral study</a>, these programs reflect the emphasis on <a>interdisciplinary</a> studies and the close student-teacher relationship that have come to be characteristic of the College's undergraduate program.  Intensive work with faculty members, small <a>seminar</a>s, and one-on-one conferences form the foundation of the curricular model.  According to their own literature, the programs make an effort to balance the &quot;theoretical (usually discussed in seminars and conferences) with the practical (in the form of <a>fieldwork</a>, <a>practicum</a>s, research or creative work). This <a>experiential work</a> is most often conducted not in isolation, but in the midst of a community. Interdisciplinary work and ideas are encouraged, as is an <a>ethic</a> of <a>social responsibility</a>.&quot;  There are approximately 340 graduate students currently enrolled in the following programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Art of Teaching</a></li>
  <li>Child Development</li>
  <li>Health Advocacy</li>
  <li>Human Genetics</li>
  <li>Theatre</li>
  <li>Women's History</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Dance</li>
</ul>
<h3>SAT and academic ranking</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2007, some educators in the <a>United States</a> began to question the impact of <a>rankings</a> on the <a>college admissions process</a>, due in part to the 11 March 2007 <em><a>Washington Post</a></em> article &quot;The Cost of Bucking College Rankings&quot; by <a>Dr. Michele Tolela Myers</a>, the former president of Sarah Lawrence College. As Sarah Lawrence College dropped its <a>SAT</a> test score submission requirement for its undergraduate applicants in 2003, thus joining the <a>SAT optional movement</a> for <a>undergraduate</a> <a>admission</a>, SLC does not have SAT data to send to <em>U.S. News</em> for its national survey. Of this decision, Myers states, &quot;We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.&quot; At present, Sarah Lawrence is the only American college that completely disregards SAT scores in its admission process.  As a result of this policy, in the same <em>Washington Post</em> article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> that if no SAT scores were submitted, U.S. News would &quot;make up a number&quot; to use in its magazines. She further argues that if SLC were to decide to stop sending all data to <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, their ranking would be artificially decreased. <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> issued a response to this article on 12 March 2007 which stated that the evaluation of Sarah Lawrence is currently under review. Myers also indicated in a press release for <em>Sarah Lawrence</em> that the college will be involved in developing the new database of colleges discussed in the Annapolis Group statement as they &quot;believe in accountability and openness, and that the public has a right to solid and reliable information about the important decisions involved in choosing a college.&quot; The press release also indicated that <em>Sarah Lawrence</em> &quot;plans not to participate in the peer reputational survey or data collection for U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s rankings&quot; as, according to Myers, &quot;by submitting data and the peer reputation survey we have tacitly been endorsing these rankings [...] all the information we have provided to U.S. News in the past will be available to the public through other channels.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2009, <a>Forbes</a> rated it 65th of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition and finances</h3>
<p>According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Sarah Lawrence College has been the most expensive college in the country for the previous two academic years (2008&#x2013;2009;2009&#x2013;2010).</p>
<p>The total cost of tuition, fees, room, and board for a student entering in the fall of 2009 was $55,788.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Westlands House</a></p>
<p>The site of  Sarah Lawrence campus is located atop a promontory above the banks of the <a>Bronx River</a>. Much of the campus was originally a part of the estate of the College's founder, <a>William Van Duzer Lawrence</a>, though the College has more than doubled its geographical size since Lawrence bequeathed his estate to the College in 1926. The terrain of the campus is characterized by dramatic outcroppings of exposed <a>bedrock</a> shaded by large oak and elm trees. Much of the older architecture on the campus follows the <a>Tudor style</a> that was popular in the area during the early 20th century, and many of the College's newer buildings attempt to achieve an updated interpretation of the same architectural style.  The campus is divided into two distinctive sections: the &quot;Old Campus&quot; and the &quot;New Campus,&quot; wherein the former is roughly contained within the boundaries of the erstwhile Lawrence estate, and the latter is that which was obtained some time after the College's earliest years.</p>
<p>The area outside the original Lawrence estate is home to the College's more cutting-edge facilities. A number of stately, century-old Tudor-style mansions will be found among these newer additions, including Andrews, Tweed, Lynd, Marshall Field, and Slonim House. Each was once a private estate, purchased by the college during periods of growth and expansion. The more modest Tudor houses along Mead Way, which were also once private residences, now serve as dorms for Sarah Lawrence students. &quot;Slonim Woods&quot; is a group of newer, townhouse-style dorms, built on the grounds of Slonim House.</p>
<p>The Campbell Sports Center was constructed in 1998 in response to an increased focus on physical fitness and sports. This state-of-the-art facility includes an indoor pool, gymnasium, track, raquetball courts, and weightrooms.</p>
<p>In 2004, the College completed construction of a state-of-the-art visual arts facility, the Monika A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center, the sleek architecture and <a>environmentally friendly</a> aspects of which earned the College national press attention. Just down the road is Hill House, a seven-story apartment building purchased by the College in the late 1990s that now houses student residences. Across the street from Hill House is the large Wrexham house, also in the Tudor style, that was purchased by Sarah Lawrence in 2004 from the government of <a>Rwanda</a>. This building, which once housed the Rwandan consul, has been renovated and is used by the College for various graduate studies programs. On the opposite end of the campus stands the Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994.</p>

<p><img></p>
<h4>Academic facilities</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bates Center for Student Life</strong> is one of the original campus buildings. A huge facility designed in the English Tudor style that is common in the area, it has housed not just offices and classrooms, but everything from maids&#x2019; quarters to dining halls to laboratories and arts facilities. At one time, it was home to a miniature basketball court that is now a painting studio, though the lines of the court can still be seen on the floors. Over the years, programs in science, visual arts and physical education have grown to the point that they&#x2019;ve spilled over elsewhere on the campus, requiring three buildings of their own. Bates has always been home to the College's main dining facility and also houses the popular &quot;Health Food Bar.&quot;</li>
  <li><strong>The Esther Raushenbush Library</strong>, designed in 1974 by Walter, Burns, Toan &amp; Lundein an architectural style meant to interpret in a more modern and sleek fashion the implied buttresses and strong features of its much older neighbor, Andrews House. The Raushenbush Library houses over 300,000 volumes.</li>
  <li><strong>The Alice Stone Ilchman Science and Mathematics Center</strong>, completed in 1994, is situated on the far north end of the campus.  It houses science laboratories in addition to classrooms and faculty offices. The building is named for former president <a>Alice Stone Ilchman</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Marshall Field Music Building</strong> was originally created as part of William Lawrence's residential neighborhood, <a>Lawrence Park West</a>.  Built in the Georgian Colonial style, it was situated on  of landscaped land when the college purchased it in 1960 to house the music department and to provide additional student housing. Prior to the purchase, President Harold Taylor played his clarinet in several of the rooms to test the acoustics.</li>
  <li><strong>The Monica A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center</strong> is the newest building on campus.  The building was designed by <a>Polshek Partnership Architects</a>. Completed in 2004, the building has garnered national press for its 'green' design. Relating to the college&#x2019;s stated goals, the building engages the landscape and existing campus circulation patterns, promotes student engagement through transparency, and takes a leadership role in sustainable design. The jury applauded its inventive use of materials; consistent development of the project in relation to the original concept; well-integrated plan/section; and exemplary use of building siting, solar orientation, daylighting, and locally quarried fieldstone to achieve LEED certification. The American Institute of Architects awarded a special 'Sustainable Architecture Honor Award' to the project as well as First Honor Awards at its 2005 &#x201c;Celebration of Architecture&#x201d;.</li>
  <li><strong>The Campbell Sports Center</strong> - One of the newest buildings on campus, the Sports Center was completed in 1997 and houses a swimming pool, a rowing tank, a weight room and exercise center, an indoor running track, squash courts, a basketball court, classrooms, locker rooms, and administrative offices.</li>
  <li><strong>The Charles DeCarlo Performing Arts Center</strong>, remodeled and greatly expanded in 1974, is a large facility on the western end of the South Lawn.    Named for former College president Charles DeCarlo, the complex comprises the Bessie Sch&#x00f6;nberg Dance Theatre, the 200-seat Suzanne Werner Wright Theatre, the 400-seat Reisinger Auditorium, the 117-seat Cannon Workshop Theatre modeled after <a>Shakespeare</a>'s <a>Globe Theatre</a>, and rehearsal spaces and work areas.  The College bookstore is located in the PAC.</li>
  <li><strong>The Ruth Leff Siegel Center</strong>, which is almost exclusively referred to as &quot;The Pub,&quot; was originally constructed as a gardener&#x2019;s cottage on the Lawrence estate, then used as an infirmary and later as a faculty house. When the College began admitting male students in 1968, it became temporary housing for men. During the 1970s, the space was remodeled and christened &#x201c;The Pub&#x201d; for use as an informal dining hall and as a space for student activities. During the 1980s, it was renamed &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s Place,&#x201d; honoring former President DeCarlo. In 1998, the entire structure was renovated, an addition was built, and the new complex took on its present official name. Today, it houses primarily a caf&#x00e9; serving on-the-go food, but also meeting spaces and the College's &quot;Red Room,&quot; which serves as a political activism center.</li>
  <li><strong>The Tea House</strong>, also known as the &quot;Tea Haus&quot; because of the German architecture facade, was originally a gazebo built by the Lawrence family on a small rock hill on the north lawn of their estate. After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect <a>Phillip Johnson</a> in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a caf&#x00e9; selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it is a fact that the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, there seems to be no evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member <a>Joseph Campbell</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Administration buildings</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Andrews Annex</strong>, built in the 1990s adjacent to Andrews House, houses a number of administrative offices.</li>
  <li><strong>Lyles House</strong> is home to the College's Health Services Center.</li>
  <li><strong>The President's House</strong>, built in 1921 and designed by architect <a>Louis Bowman</a> of <a>McKim, Meade &amp; White</a>, is an exquisite example of 16th century <a>Tudor style</a> architecture. Its living room features restored carved beams, representing the various trades, from a 16th century Tudor mansion in England. Additionally, above the mantel a <a>Christian</a> creation story is told in intricate wood carving. Campus legend dictates that a secret panel exists in the living room leading to a wine cellar, which was built during <a>Prohibition</a>. The President's House has housed the College's presidents since 1954, when the first President's House, located north of campus, was demolished to make way for the <a>Sprain Brook Parkway</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Robinson House</strong> on Mead Way is home to the College's communications department. Until 1952, it housed &quot;The Caf,&quot; a student coffee shop, on its main floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Westlands</strong> is primarily an administrative building, but its top floor houses a number of student living spaces. Completed in 1917, it is the oldest building on campus and was home to Sarah Bates Lawrence and <a>William Van Duzer Lawrence</a> before being given to the College. Dynamically situated at the highest point of elevation on the campus, it is another example of English Tudor architecture by <a>Bates &amp; How</a>. When completed the home was pictured on the front page of the <a>New York Times</a>. It has been the heart of the campus throughout the history of the College and, owing to its massive size, it now houses the president's offices, the Office of Admission, the Office of Financial Aid, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of International Programs, the Career Counseling Office, the offices of all of the College's deans, and a number of meeting spaces in addition to the top-floor dorms.</li>
  <li><strong>The Wrexham Road Property</strong>, acquired by the College in 2004, is a large manor house that once belonged to the government of Rwanda and used as a home for its consul. The building currently houses the Center for Continuing Education and various graduate-level programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Housing</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Andrews House</strong>, a former manor house purchased for $200,000 by the College in 1935 from Arthur Lawrence, a son of the College's founders, is known for its high ceilings, fireplaces, and its spiraling main staircase.  The house is designed in the Germantown Colonial Style by architect Penrose Scott.  The majority of the building houses students, but it is also the home of the College's Department of Operations and Facilities and to the offices of the Writing faculty.</li>
  <li><strong>Andrews Court</strong> refers to the 12 cottage-style buildings to the south of Andrews House.  Built in 1974, the buildings have, on average, about 8 units each in addition to full kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dudley Lawrence</strong>, the northernmost building, houses two classrooms in addition to living spaces. It is named for William Lawrence's son, who oversaw the construction of the Old Dorms.</li>
  <li><strong>Gilbert</strong>, named for one of the College's original trustees, is the northernmost building of the three, and is known for being quiet and populated with the College's more studious set.</li>
  <li><strong>McCracken</strong>, named for <a>Vassar College</a> president Henry McCracken, is a few years younger than its neighbors and has, at various times, housed the College library, the bookstore, and a number of other facilities in addition to living spaces.  Although it still serves as a dormitory, it now also houses dance studios, meeting spaces, and administrative offices.</li>
  <li><strong>Titsworth</strong> is an all-girls dorm and was also named for one of the College's founding trustees.  It occupies the space between Gilbert and Dudley Lawrence, and is also home to the Titsworth Lecture Hall.</li>
</ul>
<h5>&quot;New Dorms&quot;</h5>
<p>Designed by the renowned architect <a>Phillip Johnson</a> in the sparse modernist style of the time, the &quot;New Dorms&quot; were completed in 1960. The architectural style of the buildings is meant to be a modernist reflection of the three older dorms (Gilbert, Titsworth, and Dudley Lawrence) that stand on the opposite side of the North Lawn. The three buildings that comprise the New Dorms are connected by two glass atria in which the buildings' primary stairwells are found. With the exception of the large apartments in Rothschild, these dorms typically house first-year students.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong> is a traditional dormitory-style building with shared bathrooms.</li>
  <li><strong>Rothschild</strong> comprises apartment style, air-conditioned dorm spaces with kitchens, living rooms, and an elevator.  The basement houses a number of small classrooms and studios in use predominantly by the theater department.</li>
  <li><strong>Taylor</strong> is nearly an exact copy in design of its neighbor, Garrison.</li>
</ul>
<h5>The Mead Way Houses</h5>
<p>The Mead Way Houses are the eight former private homes that stand along the steep hill of Mead Way on the College's eastern end. The two southernmost houses, Robinson and Swinford, are occupied by administrative offices and the office of the campus internet radio station, and the northernmost six houses, listed below, are reserved for student living spaces.  The northern houses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brebner House</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Mansell House</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Morris House</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Perkins House</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Schmidt House</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Warren Green House</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Presidents</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|300px|SLC Presidents Mansion</a></p>
<p>The first president was Marion Coats from 1924 to 1929.  She was a friend of <a>Vassar College</a> President Henry McCracken and of Sarah Lawrence founder William Van Duzer Lawrence.  Coats had traditional views of women's role in society that were at odds with her progressive approach to women's education.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb</a> The College sponsors intercollegiate teams in <a>crew</a> (aka rowing), <a>equestrian</a>, men's <a>basketball</a>, men and women&#x2019;s <a>tennis</a>, women&#x2019;s <a>volleyball</a>, women&#x2019;s <a>softball</a>, and women's <a>swimming</a>.</p>
<p>The College's official mascot is the <a>Gryphon</a>. It was chosen in the 1990s to represent the College's athletics teams after a long period of fielding sports teams without an official <a>mascot</a>. Unofficially the student body had long adopted the large resident population of '<a>Black Squirrels</a>' as a de facto mascot to the college. The position of silent mascot that the 'Black Squirrel' occupied was financially endorsed by the college itself with the production of various Black Squirrel merchandise (including Sarah Lawrence clothing branded with the Black Squirrel image) and plush toys. It is only recently (post 2003) that efforts on the behalf of the college to establish the Gryphon as the icon of Sarah Lawrence have begun to take root.</p>
<p>Sarah Lawrence recently re-established the men's soccer team that plays in the Hudson Valley Men's Athletic Conference. <img></p>
