<p><strong>&#x00c5;bo Akademi University</strong> ( ) is a <a>Swedish language</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Turku</a>, <a>Finland</a> (&#x00c5;bo is the Swedish name of the city). , there are 7 941 students and a staff consisting of 1125 people. The university has activities not only in Turku, but also in <a>Vaasa</a>, <a>Jakobstad</a>, <a>Helsinki</a> and on <a>&#x00c5;land</a>. &#x00c5;bo Akademi was a private institution until 1981, when it was turned into a public institution.</p>
<p>&#x00c5;bo Akademi should not be confused with the <a>Royal Academy of &#x00c5;bo</a>, which was founded in 1640, but moved to <a>Helsinki</a> after the <a>Turku fire</a> of 1827 and is today known as the <a>University of Helsinki</a>.</p>
<p>&#x00c5;bo Akademi was founded by private donations in 1918 as the second university in Finland, both to let Turku again become a university town and because it was felt that the Swedish language was threatened at the University of Helsinki. The Finnish <a>University of Turku</a> was founded 1920, also by private donations and for similar reasons.</p>
<p>As the only Swedish university in Finland &#x00c5;bo Akademi University is responsible for higher education for all of the Swedish-speaking population (there is also some education given in Swedish at the University of Helsinki, but successful studies there require knowing Finnish). This role has many implications, on the education and research as well as on the social environment. As there are few students in most subjects, cooperation between the subjects and with other universities is very important.</p>
<p>A significant minority of the students are Finnish-speaking. While Turku in itself is mostly Finnish, the university provides a strong Swedish environment. Most of the students, regardless of original language, will be functionally bilingual when finishing their studies.</p>
<p>The university has a policy that non-<a>Swedish</a> speaking applicants from the <a>Nordic countries</a> are required to participate in a Swedish language test, in order to prove their ability to successfully study in Swedish. Applicants from non-Nordic countries can, however, choose between <a>Swedish</a> or <a>English language</a> tests.</p>
