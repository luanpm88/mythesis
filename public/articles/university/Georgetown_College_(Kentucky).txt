<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1829, the <a>Kentucky Legislature</a> chartered the Kentucky Baptist Education Society with the purpose of establishing a Baptist college in the state. Twenty-four trustees under the leadership of Silas Noel selected the town of Georgetown as the site for the new school. Georgetown was selected because the community agreed to raise $20,000 and to donate the assets of Rittenhouse Academy, a failed land grant school in the town that had recently closed.  Rittenhouse Academy was the predecessor of Royal Springs school.</li>
