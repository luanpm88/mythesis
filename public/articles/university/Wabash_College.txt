<p> <strong>Wabash College</strong> is a small, private, <a>liberal arts college</a> for <a>men</a>, located in <a>Crawfordsville, Indiana</a>. Along with <a>Hampden-Sydney College</a> and <a>Morehouse College</a>, Wabash is one of only three remaining traditional all-<a>men's liberal arts colleges</a> in the United States. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wabash College was founded in 1832 by a number of men including several <a>Dartmouth College</a> graduates. It was originally called &quot;The Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College.&quot; In the early days a large number of students, deficient in credits, were required to attend the &quot;Preparatory School&quot; of Wabash.&lt;ref&gt;Gronert: pg. 30&#x2013;31, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Caleb Mills</a>, the first faculty member, would later come to be known as the father of the Indiana public education system and would work throughout his life to improve education in the <a>Mississippi Valley</a> area.  Patterning it after the liberal arts colleges of <a>New England</a>, they resolved &quot;that the institution be at first a classical and English high school, rising into a college as soon as the wants of the country demand.&quot;  After declaring the site at which they were standing would be the location of the new school, they knelt in the snow and conducted a dedication service.  Although Mills, like many of the founders, was a <a>Presbyterian</a> minister, they were committed that Wabash should be <a>independent</a> and <a>non-sectarian</a>.</p>
<p>Elihu Baldwin was the first President of Wabash from 1835 until 1840. He came from a New York City church and accepted the Presidency even though he knew that Wabash was threatened with bankruptcy. He met the challenge and gave thorough study to the &quot;liberal arts program&quot; at Wabash. After his death, he was succeeded by Charles White, a graduate of Dartmouth College, and the brother-in-law of Edmund O. Hovey, a professor at the college.&lt;ref&gt;Gronert: pg. 66&#x2013;67.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Joseph F. Tuttle, after whom Tuttle Grade School in Crawfordsville was named in 1906, (and Tuttle Middle School in 1960), became President of Wabash College in 1862 and served for 30&nbsp;years. &quot;He was an eloquent preacher, a sound administrator and an astute handler of public relations.&quot; Joseph Tuttle, together with his administrators, worked to improve relations in Crawfordsville between &quot;<a>Town and gown</a>&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gronert: pg. 205&#x2013;206.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>National ranking</h2>
<p>According to <a>Forbes magazine's</a> 2010 ranking for academic institutions, <em>America's Best Colleges</em>, Wabash College ranked 42nd.[<a>http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/94/best-colleges-10_Americas-Best-Colleges_Rank_2.html</a>] It has been noted that there is some controversy dealing with the methodology of the survey.[<a>http://www.ivygateblog.com/2008/08/surprise-surprise</a>] The 2010 version of the longstanding <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> rankings places Wabash 58th among national liberal arts colleges. [<a>http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/liberal-arts-rankings/page+3</a>] Wabash College is also listed in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Endowment</h2>
<p>For the 2009 fiscal year, the value of the College&#x2019;s endowment was approximately $272 million.  The benefactors who have funded this endowment include the <a>pharmaceutical</a> <a>industrialist</a> <a>Eli Lilly</a>, the company he founded, and his heirs.  The school's library is named after Lilly.</p>
<h2>Student government</h2>
<p>The <a>student government</a>, referred to collectively as the Student Body of Wabash College, comprises <a>executive</a> and <a>legislative</a> branches.  The executive authority of the student body is vested in a <a>president</a> and <a>vice-president</a> who chair the Senior Council and Student Senate, respectively.  They are <em><a>ex officio</a></em>, non-voting members of the body that they do not chair.  The president has broad powers of appointment over all Senate <a>standing committees</a>.  The vice-president possesses a tie-breaking vote in the Student Senate.</p>
<p>The Student Senate of Wabash College is the legislative authority, consisting of <a>senators</a> from each residence hall and fraternity, four <a>representatives</a> from each of the three underclasses, and the chairmen of the Senate's standing committees.  The body of approximately 32 voting members manages an annual budget of over $400,000, allocating funds and setting guidelines for recognized associations.  The Senate also serves as a general student forum.  The Senate's <a>standing committees</a> are the Audit and Finance Committee, the Board of Publications, and the Constitution, Bylaw, and Policy Review Committee.  The third serves as a non-partisan resource for drafting legislative proposals; it is also empowered to adjudicate constitutional disputes and is occasionally called upon to evaluate proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The Senior Council of Wabash College is a special quasi-legislative body comprising the presidents of certain student organizations and self-selected at-large councilmen.  The Senior Council is responsible for representing student concerns to the faculty and administration, as well as fostering campus unity and maintaining proper regard for college traditions.</p>
<p>The student government does not include a <a>judicial</a> branch.  Power to interpret the Constitution of the Student Body of Wabash College is vested in the legislature; questions of interpretation are generally delegated to the Constitution, Bylaw, and Policy Review Committee.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> The school's sports teams are called the Little Giants.  They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division&nbsp;III and in the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a>, where they are currently back-to-back-to-back-to-back (2005&#x2013;2008) NCAC football champions. Every year since 1911, Wabash College has played rival <a>DePauw University</a> in a football game called the <a>Monon Bell</a> Classic. Wabash College is a member of the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a>.  The rallying cheer of Wabash College athletics is &quot;Wabash always fights.&quot;  Wabash College competes in Men's Intercollegiate Baseball, Basketball, Tennis, Cross Country, Track and Field, Golf, Football, Soccer, Swimming &amp; Diving and Wrestling.</p>
<p>The <a>basketball</a> team at Wabash is coached by Malcolm &quot;Mac&quot; Petty, he is entering his 33rd&nbsp;season at the helm of the Little Giant program. The 18th&nbsp;coach in Wabash's rich basketball history, Petty quickly established himself as an outstanding coach by guiding the 1981&#x2013;82 team to the NCAA Division&nbsp;III title with a 24&#x2013;4 record. Petty led that team, and the two before it, to the NCAA Division&nbsp;III Tournament by winning 19 or more games each year. Petty joined an elite group of coaches in 2003, becoming the 17th&nbsp;active coach in Division&nbsp;III history to record 400&nbsp;career victories. Petty will begin this season with an overall record of 463&#x2013;364, 15th-best among active Division&nbsp;III coaches and 27th-best in the history of DIII basketball.  Wabash won the first <a>national intercollegiate championship basketball tournament</a> ever held in 1922.</p>
<p><a>Football</a> at Wabash dates back to 1884, when student-coach <a>Edwin R. Taber</a> assembled a team and defeated <a>Butler University</a> by a score of 4&#x2013;0 in the first intercollegiate football game in the history of the state of <a>Indiana</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Ancestry.com</a> Edwin R. Taber&lt;/ref&gt;  The current head football coach is <a>Erik Raeburn</a> who replaced <a>Chris Creighton</a> after completion of the 2007 season.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2010, Wabash officially began reconstruction Mud Hollow and Byron P. Hollett Stadium which will provide the football, soccer, baseball and intramural teams with better athletic facilities.</p>
<h3>Monon Bell Classic</h3>
<p>:<em>See also: <a>Monon Bell Classic</a></em> Voted &quot;Indiana's Best College Sports Rivalry&quot; by viewers of <a>ESPN</a> in 2005, DePauw University and Wabash College play each November &#x2014; in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams &#x2014; for the right to keep or reclaim the Monon Bell. The two teams first met in 1890. In 1932, the <a>Monon Railroad</a> donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year. The series is as close as a historic rivalry can be: Wabash leads the series 55&#x2013;53&#x2013;9. The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000&nbsp;seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by <a>ABC</a>, <a>ESPN2</a>, and <a>HDNet</a> (where it will appear from 2007&#x2013;2010.) Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 50&nbsp;locations around the United States for telecast parties, and a commemorative DVD (including historic clips known as &quot;Monon Memories&quot;) is produced each year. The most recent Monon Bell game, played on November&nbsp;13, 2010, saw Wabash defeat DePauw 47-0. </p>
<p>In 1999, <em><a>GQ</a></em> listed the Monon Bell game as reason #3 on its &quot;50 Reasons Why College Football is Better Than Pro Football&quot; list.</p>
<h2>Summer Programs</h2>
<p>Wabash has two summer programs for high school students:  <a>Blueprint Summer Programs</a> and <a>OLAB (Opportunities to Learn about Business)</a>.  </p>
<p>The Blueprint program is for young men entering grades 10-12 and begins on July 10th. Students may choose to stay for one or two weeks. Courses are designed and led by Wabash faculty. 2011 courses include: Critical Pedagogy, Pharmaceutical Development, Coaching for the Greater Good, and Life and Death - Ethics and Law. Students live and study on campus and go on field trips to Indianapolis and other destinations.</p>
<p>OLAB is a co-ed program going into its 39th year at Wabash. OLAB is a one-week hands-on introduction to business and the market economy for young women and men entering their senior year in high school. In 2010, 44 students from 11 states and Korea participated in the OLAB program.</p>

<h2>Fraternities</h2>
<p>The Greek system has a unique role at Wabash; with 49% of students belonging to one of the campus's nine <a>fraternities</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/most-frats</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other colleges and universities, Wabash fraternity members &#x2014; including pledges &#x2014; live in the fraternity houses by default.  While most Wabash fraternities allow juniors and seniors to live outside the house, the majority of Greek students live in their respective house all four years.  This has led to the odd circumstance of a college with fewer than 1,000&nbsp;students being dotted with Greek houses of a size appropriate to campuses ten times Wabash's size.</p>
<p><a>Fraternity rush</a> at Wabash begins before the academic year.  During March, students accepted for the coming year are invited to the campus for Honor Scholar Weekend, during which they take a battery of exams and compete for <a>scholarship</a> money.  The students are distributed among the nine fraternities, where they stay during their visit.  In the evenings following the day's testing, the fraternities and the Independent Men's Association host a variety of parties and events open to all.  Fraternities are allowed to offer bids to prospectives starting that weekend, and rush runs through summer until it concludes one week after school begins.  Upon accepting a bid, the pledge is then housed in the corresponding fraternity house.  As many pledges accept over the summer, it is quite possible for a <a>freshman</a> never to see the inside of a <a>dorm room</a>.</p>

<h2>Wabash in fiction and popular culture</h2>
<p>Wabash College has, despite its small size, been referred to in several cultural contexts:</p>
<p><strong>Fiction</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>George Ade</a> set his 1904&lt;ref&gt;<a>College of Liberal Arts - Purdue Univ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Maybe the source of the confusion as to 1904 vs 1924 is that Purdue University last year put on a production of the 1904 play within a set intentionally forward-dated to 1924. See the reference link---&gt; play <em>The College Widow</em> on a fictionalized version of the Wabash College campus.  (Ade, an alumnus of nearby <a>Purdue</a>, saw his play adapted as a 1930 movie, retitled <em>Maybe It's Love</em>.)</li>
  <li><a>Ernest Hemingway</a> mentions the college in his work <em><a>In Our Time</a></em> Chapter&nbsp;IX, putting it among the ranks of Harvard and Columbia.</li>
  <li><a>Kurt Vonnegut</a> referenced Wabash and used a college alum as the basis for Dwayne Hoover in <em><a>Breakfast of Champions</a></em>.</li>
  <li>One of the protagonists of <a>Dan Simmons</a>'s <em><a>Hyperion</a></em> is a professor of ethics at a fictionalized Wabash; other characters in Simmons' novels are based on people he knew while attending.</li>
  <li>Wabash is also mentioned in <em><a>The Plot Against America</a></em> by <a>Phillip Roth</a>; the protagonist's family is shown around <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, by a guide who was a history lecturer at the college until losing his job in the <a>Great Depression</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Film and Television</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A scene in the sports movie <em><a>Hoosiers</a></em> finds the star player's guardian Myra Fleener (<a>Barbara Hershey</a>) telling coach Norman Dale (<a>Gene Hackman</a>) to stay away from Jimmy Chitwood, the player under her care, saying &quot;He's a real special kid, and I have high hopes for him... I think if he works really hard, he can get an academic scholarship to Wabash College and can get out of this place.&quot;</li>
  <li>The film Leatherheads, the football team states that they played a clean game against Wabash (circa 1925), even though Wabash only had 9 men.</li>
  <li>Wabash's student radio station, WNDY, loaned its call letters to the fictional Chicago radio station featured in the 1992 <a>Dolly Parton</a> movie <em><a>Straight Talk</a></em>.  Alluding to this, a studio engineer is wearing a Wabash sweatshirt in one scene.</li>
  <li>The college's name appears on a fraternity's composite portrait in an <a>episode</a> of <em><a>Drawn Together</a></em>.  The seal resembles the seal of <a>Tau Kappa Epsilon</a>, which would make the composite that of the Alpha-Alpha chapter of TKE at Wabash.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The idea for the 1876 <a>Centennial Exposition</a>, the first official world's fair held in the United States, is credited to former Wabash Prof. John Campbell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On Wabash</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;The poetry in the life of a college like Wabash is to be found in its history. It is to be found in the fact that once on this familiar campus and once in these well-known halls, students and teachers as real as ourselves worked and studied, argued and laughed and worshiped together, but are now gone, one generation vanishing after another, as surely as we shall shortly be gone. But if you listen, you can hear their songs and their cheers. As you look, you can see the torch which they handed down to us.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&#x2014; Byron K. Trippet '30, Ninth President of Wabash College</li>
  <li>&quot;How well we have done together with our purpose will be demonstrated by how well you perform as individuals in the next ten, twenty, or thirty years &#x2013; not as captains of industry or brilliant doctors or lawyers or teachers, but as men of sound character and sound intellect in the communities of which you become a part. And our future strength as a college will be determined to no small extent by what you as alumni feel and say and do about your alma mater.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&#x2014; Byron K. Trippet '30, Ninth President of Wabash College</li>
  <li>&quot;Perhaps we'll learn that there are more things to admire in men than to despise; perhaps, knowing it will never be enough to change the world, we will act more honorably than we expected we would; perhaps we'll have a lot of fun along the way. It wouldn't be a bad life.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&#x2014; William C. Placher '70, 1970 Commencement Address</li>
