<p>The <strong>Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg</strong> (<strong>Ruperto Carola</strong>, <strong>Heidelberg University</strong>, or simply <strong>Heidelberg</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>research</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Heidelberg</a>, <a>Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg</a>, <a>Germany</a>. Founded in 1386, it is the <a>oldest university in Germany</a> and was the fourth university established in the <a>Holy Roman Empire</a>. A <a>coeducational</a> institution since 1899, today Heidelberg consists of twelve <a>faculties</a> and offers degree programs at <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>graduate</a> and <a>postdoctoral</a> levels in some 100 disciplines. It is a <a>German Excellence University</a>, as well as a founding member of the <a>League of European Research Universities</a>, the <a>Coimbra Group</a>, and the <a>European University Association</a>.</p>
<p><a>Rupert I</a>, <a>Elector Palatine</a> established the university when Heidelberg was the capital of the <a>Palatinate</a>. Consequently, it served as a center for theologians and law experts from throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Matriculation rates declined with the <a>Thirty Years' War</a>, and the university did not overcome its fiscal and intellectual crises until the early 19th century. Subsequently, the institution once again became a hub for independent thinkers, and developed into a &quot;stronghold of <a>humanism</a>&quot;, and a center of democratic thinking. At this time, Heidelberg served as a role model for the  implementation of <a>graduate school</a>s at American universities. However, the university lost many of its dissident professors and was marked a <a>NSDAP</a> university during the <a>Nazi era</a> (between 1933 and 1945). It later underwent an extensive <a>denazification</a> after <a>World War II</a>&#x2014;Heidelberg serving as one of the main scenes of the left-wing <a>student protests</a> in Germany in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Modern scientific <a>psychiatry</a>; <a>psychopharmacology</a>; psychiatric <a>genetics</a>; environmental <a>physics</a>; and modern <a>sociology</a> were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Associated with 30 <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates, the university continues to emphasize research. It is consistently ranked among Europe's top overall universities, and is an international education venue for doctoral students, with approximately 1,000 <a>doctorate</a>s successfully completed every year, and with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad. <a>International student</a>s from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body. Heidelberg comprises two major campuses: one in <a>Heidelberg</a>'s Old Town and another in the <a>Neuenheimer Feld</a> quarter on the outskirts of the city. The university's noted alumni include eleven domestic and foreign <a>Heads of State</a> or <a>Heads of Government</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>[[Image:RupertI.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Rupert I, Elector Palatine|Rupert I]] founded the University of Heidelberg in 1386]]</p>
<p>Around 1400, the city of <a>Heidelberg</a> had approximately 3,000 inhabitants, but the <a>Great Schism</a> in 1378, which split European <a>Christendom</a> into two hostile groups made it possible for this relatively small city to get its own university.</p>
<p>The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two <a>pope</a>s after the death of <a>Pope Gregory XI</a> in the same year. One successor resided in <a>Avignon</a> (elected by the French) and the other in <a>Rome</a> (elected by the Italian cardinals). The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in <a>Rome</a>, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in <a>Paris</a>: they lost their stipends and had to leave.</p>
<p>On October 18, 1386, a special <a>Pontifical High Mass</a> in the <em><a>Heiliggeistkirche</a></em> commemorated the opening of the doors of the university.  On October 19, 1386, the first lecture was held, making Heidelberg the <a>oldest university in Germany</a>. In november 1386, <a>Marsilius of Inghen</a> was elected  first <a>rector</a> of the university. As a motto for the seal, he chose <em>semper apertus</em>&#x2014;i.e., &quot;the book of learning is always open.&quot;</p>
<h3>Early development</h3>
<p>[[Image:Heiliggeistkirche Heidelberg (Karl Pfaff) 1896.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Solemn Mass|solemn holy Mass]] was offered in the <em><a>Heiliggeistkirche</a></em> in 1386 to commemorate and bless the establishment of the University (photo ca. 1900).]]</p>
<p>Between 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the <a>Council of Constance</a> and acted as counselors for <a>Louis III</a>, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially teached the <a>nominalism</a> or <em>via moderna</em>. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of <a>John Wycliffe</a> were forbidden at the university, but later around 1454, the university decided that the <a>realism</a> or <em>via antique</em> would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways ().</p>
<p>The transition from <a>scholastic</a> to <a>humanistic</a> culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop <a>Johann von Dalberg</a> in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at the University of Heidelberg particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School <a>Rudolph Agricola</a>, <a>Conrad Celtes</a>, <a>Jakob Wimpfeling</a>, and <a>Johann Reuchlin</a>. <a>&#x00c6;neas Silvius Piccolomini</a> was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of <a>Worms</a>, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as <a>Pope Pius II</a>. In 1482, <a>Pope Sixtus IV</a> permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, <a>Pope Julius III</a> sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefice to secular professors.</p>
<p><a>Martin Luther</a>'s disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading <a>Reformationists</a> in Southwest Germany. With the <a>Palatinate</a>'s turn to the Reformed faith, <a>Otto Henry, Elector Palatine</a>, converted the university into a <a>calvinsitic</a> institution. In 1563, the <a>Heidelberg Catechism</a> was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school. As the 16th century was passing, the late <a>humanism</a> stepped beside <a>Calvinism</a> as a predominant school of thought; and figures like <a>Paul Schede</a>, <a>Jan Gruter</a>, <a>Martin Opitz</a>, and <a>Matth&#x00e4;us Merian</a> taught at the university. It attracted <a>scholar</a>s from all over the continent and developed into a <a>cultural</a> and <a>academic</a> center. However, with the beginning of the <a>Thirty Years' War</a> in 1618, the intellectual and <a>fiscal</a> wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous <a>Bibliotheca Palatina</a> (the <a>library</a> of the university) was stolen from the <a>University Cathedral</a> and taken to <a>Rome</a>. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King <a>Louis XIV</a>, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely. <a>thumb|right|200px|The Old University from 1735 is today the seat of the Rector and the University Senate</a></p>
<p>As a consequence of the late <a>Counter-Reformation</a>, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by <a>Jesuits</a>. In 1735, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the <a>Jesuits</a> a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borrom&#x00e6;um, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the <a>French Congregation of Lazarists</a> in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward, and the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector <a>Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine</a>, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of <a>political economy</a> from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an <a>observatory</a> in the neighboring city of <a>Mannheim</a>, where Jesuit <a>Christian Meyer</a> labored as director. In connection with the commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the university, a revised statute book, which several of the professors had been commissioned to prepare, was approved by the elector. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that period, the number of students varied from 300-400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated. As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the <a>French Revolution</a>, and particularly because of the <a>Treaty of Lun&#x00e9;ville</a>, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the <a>Rhine</a>, so that its complete dissolution was expected.</p>
<p>The German <a>Students Association</a> exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of <a>Liberalism</a> and the movement in favor of German national unity. On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in <a>book burning</a>s at <em>Universit&#x00e4;tsplatz</em> (&quot;University Square&quot;) and Heidelberg was eventually infamous as a <a>NSDAP</a> university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from &quot;The Living Spirit&quot; to &quot;The German Spirit&quot;, and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in <a>Nazi eugenics</a>: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychatric clinic then directed by <a>Carl Schneider</a> was involved in <a>Action T4</a> <a>Euthanasia</a> program.</p>
<p>After the end of <a>World War II</a>, the university underwent an extensive <a>denazification</a>.</p>
<p>Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during WWII, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, the University of Heidelberg became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to &quot;The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity&quot;. There are 4,196 full time faculty, including 476 university professors.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Heidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the <a>Rhine Neckar Triangle</a>, a <a>European metropolitan area</a> with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of <a>Heidelberg</a>, <a>Mannheim</a>, <a>Ludwigshafen</a>, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of <a>Romanticism</a>, and its old town and <a>castle</a> are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40 minutes by train away from <a>Frankfurt International Airport</a>. The University of Heidelberg&#x2019;s facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.</p>
<h3>Old Town Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|The New University of 1931 looked at from inside the Old University</a></p>
<p>The so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the <em>Universit&#x00e4;tsplatz</em> (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, such as the Goldman, Sachs, Morgan, Chrysler and Ford families, as well as other families, in line with a fundraising campaign of <a>Jacob Gould Schurman</a>, an alumnus of the University of Heidelberg and former <a>U.S. Ambassador</a> to Germany. It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in the respective faculty buildings which are spread all over the ancient part of town, though, they are mostly a maximum of ten minutes walk away from University Square. The faculties maintain own extensive libraries and work spaces for their respective students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings. The University Library's stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it holds about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals. Moreover, it holds 6,600 <a>manuscripts</a>, most notably the <a>Codex Manesse</a>, 1,800 <a>incunabula</a>, 110,500 <a>autographs</a>, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. The further 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services. Around 3,000 commercial scientific journals can be accessed via <a>e-journal</a>. The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector <a>Marsilius von Inghen</a> in 1388, which was stored in the <a>Heiliggeistkirche</a>, then the University Cathedral. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus. It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by the University of Heidelberg or in cooperation with the <a>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a> and the <a>University of Chile</a>. The University of Heidelberg has arranged cooperation agreements with both of these universities. The center has responsibility for programs of <a>postgraduate education</a>. It also coordinates the activities of the University of Heidelberg in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>The <a>Rectorate</a> is the '<a>executive body</a>' of the university, headed by rector <a>Bernhard Eitel</a>. The rectorate consists of the <a>chancellor</a>, Marina Frost, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.</p>
<p>The <a>Senate</a> is the '<a>legislative branch</a>' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators <em><a>ex officio</a></em>, as are also the <a>deans</a> of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the <a>University Hospital</a>, and the university's <a>equal opportunities officer</a>. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the <a>student body</a>; and four employees of the university administration.</p>
<p>The <a>University Council</a> is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former <a>Israel</a>i <a>Ambassador</a> to Germany <a>Avi Primor</a>, as well as <a>CEO</a>s of German industries.</p>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p>After a structural reformation in 2003, the university consists of 12 <a>faculties</a> which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the <a>Bologna process</a>, most faculties now offer <a>Bachelor's</a>, <a>Master's</a>, and <a>Ph.D.</a> degrees in order to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in <a>law</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>dentistry</a> and <a>pharmacy</a>, from which students still graduate with the <a>State Examination</a>, a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-W&#x00fc;rttemberg. </p>
<h3>Associated institutions</h3>

<p>Ranked by the number of <a>Nobel Laureates</a> affiliated with the university at the time of <a>Nobel Prize</a> announcement, Heidelberg is placed 1st in Germany, 4th in Europe and 13th in the world by 2008.</p>
<p><a>The Times</a> (London) referred to the University of Heidelberg as &quot;the oldest and most eminent in the country of Luther and Einstein&quot; and as &quot;the jewel of German learning&quot;.</p>
<h3>Organization and length of courses</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px| Main auditorium in the New University</a></p>
<p>The academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from October 1-March 31 and the summer semester from April 1-September 30. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a <a>Bachelor's degree</a> is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive <a>Master's degrees</a>. The normal duration of <a>Ph.D.</a> programs for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by <a>numerus clausus</a>, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%. Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular cell biology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%, 3.8%, and 9.1% respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the <a>Abitur</a> or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities, particularly for those which are conceptually non-vocational like classics, philosophy, and ancient history, unrestricted admission is granted if certain criteria (e.g. relevant language proficiency) are fulfilled, as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available. For prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German &#x2014; such as the <a>DSH</a> &#x2014; is required. Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade &quot;good&quot; (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master's programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. Ph.D. admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized. International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.</p>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>Studying at German universities is heavily subsidized by the state in order to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background. Since 2007, Heidelberg charges tuition fees of approximately &#x20ac; 1,200 p.a., including <a>student union</a> fees, for undergraduate, consecutive Master's, and doctoral programs, for both <a>EU</a> and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from &#x20ac; 2,200 to &#x20ac; 3,000 p.a.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2005, the University of Heidelberg had an overall <a>operating budget</a> of approximately &#x20ac; 856 M, consisting of approximately &#x20ac; 413 M government funds, approximately &#x20ac; 311 M basic budget, and approximately &#x20ac; 132 M from external grants. The university spent approximately &#x20ac; 529 M in payroll costs and approximately &#x20ac; 326 M in other expenditures. Additionally, the university will receive another &#x20ac; 150 M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2007 onwards, due to the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately &#x20ac; 19 M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately &#x20ac; 9.5 M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The Center for Advanced Study Marsilius Kolleg, situated in House Buhl, was founded in 2007</a></p>
<p>Among historical scientific achievements of Heidelberg researchers features prominently the invention of <a>spectroscopy</a>, and of the <a>Bunsen burner</a>; the discovery of chemical elements <a>Caesium</a> and <a>Rubidium</a>; and the identification and isolation of <a>nicotine</a> as the main <a>pharmacological</a>ly active component of <a>tobacco</a>. Modern scientific <a>psychiatry</a>; <a>psychopharmacology</a>; psychiatric <a>genetics</a>; Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of <a>Plastination</a> to preserve <a>body tissue</a>, conducted the first successful transplantation of <a>hematopoietic stem cells</a>, and recently developed a new strategy for a <a>vaccination</a> in order to prevent certain forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Today, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The <em>Marsilius Kolleg</em>, named after <a>Marsilius of Inghen</a>, was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities. Other institutes such as the <em><a>Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing</a></em>, the <em>Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences</em>, the <em><a>Heidelberg Center for American Studies</a></em>, and the <em><a>South Asia Institute</a></em> also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.</p>
<p>Noted regular publications of the <a>Center for Astronomy</a> include the <a>Gliese catalogue of nearby stars</a>, the fundamental catalogues <a>FK5</a> and <a>FK6</a> and the annual published <a>Apparent places</a>, a high precision catalog with pre-calculated positions for over 3,000 stars for each day. The <a>Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research</a> publishes the annual <a>Conflict Barometer</a>, which describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. Regular publications by the <a>Max Planck Institute for International Law</a> include the &quot;Heidelberg Journal for International Law&quot;, the &quot;Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law&quot;; the &quot;Journal of the History of International Law&quot;; the &quot;Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law&quot;; and the semi-annual bibliography &quot;Public International Law&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a>German Research Foundation</a> (DFG) currently funds twelve long-term <a>Collaborative Research Centers</a> (SFB) with a duration of up to 12 years at Heidelberg, four Priority Programs (SPP) with a duration of six years, two Research Units (FOR) with a duration of up to six years, as well as numerous individual projects at the university's faculties and institutes. As a result of the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>, two Clusters of Excellence are funded with &#x20ac; 6.5 M each - &quot;<em>Cellular Networks: From Molecular Mechanisms to Quantitative Understanding of Complex Functions</em>&quot;, and &quot;<em>Asia and Europe in a Global Context: Shifting Asymmetries in Cultural Flows</em>&quot;</p>

The track and field team regularly achieves best placings at the German university championships. The University Sports Club men's basketball team, <a>USC Heidelberg</a>, is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the second division of <a>Germany's national league</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are the student parliament <a>AStA</a>, the student councils of the 12 faculties, four drama clubs, the university orchestra <a>Collegium Musicum</a>, four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO&#x2019;s, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, a debate society, two student management consulting groups, and four religious student groups.</p>
<p>Heidelberg&#x2019;s student newspaper &quot;<em>ruprecht</em>&quot; is &#x2014; with editions of more than 10,000 copies &#x2014; one of Germany&#x2019;s largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the <a>MLP</a> Pro Campus Press Award as Germany&#x2019;s best student newspaper. The jury, consisting of journalists of major newspapers, commended its &#x201c;well balanced, though critical attitude&#x201d;, and its &#x201c;simply great&#x201d; layout which &#x201c;suffices highest professional demands&#x201d;. The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining its independence from the university's management. Some very renowned journalists emerged from <em>ruprecht</em><img>s editorial board. However, the critical online student newspaper &quot;UNiMUT&quot;, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the <em>ruprecht</em> often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented. Heidelberg is also home of Germany&#x2019;s oldest student <a>law review</a> &quot;<em>StudZR</em>&quot;. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.</p>
<p>Heidelberg hosts 34 student <a>corporations</a>, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the <a>fraternities</a> in the US. As traditional symbols (<a>couleur</a>) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (<em>Kommers</em>) and some still practice the traditional <a>academic fencing</a>, a kind of duel, in order to &quot;shape their members for the challenges of life&quot;. In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations' often representative 19th century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.</p>
<p><a>Heidelberg</a> is not least famous for its student night life. Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soir&#x00e9;es of Heidelberg's 34 student fraternities, the city, and the <a>metropolitan area</a> even more, offers night life for any taste and budget. Adjacent to University Square is Heidelberg's major night life district, where one pub is placed next to each other. From Thursday on, it is all night very crowded and full of atmosphere. Moreover, Heidelberg has five major discos. The largest of them is located at the New Campus. The city of <a>Mannheim</a>, which is about three times as large as Heidelberg, is a 15-minute train ride away, and offers an even more diverse night life, having a broad variety of clubs and bars well-frequented by both Heidelberg's and Mannheim's student community.</p>

<p>Alumni and faculty of the university include many founders and pioneers of <a>academic discipline</a>s, and a large number of internationally acclaimed <a>philosopher</a>s, <a>poet</a>s, <a>jurisprudents</a>, <a>theologians</a>, <a>natural</a> and <a>social scientists</a>. 30 <a>Nobel Laureates</a>, at least 18 <a>Leibniz Laureates</a>, and two <a>&quot;Oscar&quot; winners</a> have been associated with the University of Heidelberg. Eight <a>Nobel Laureates</a> received the award during their tenure at Heidelberg.</p>
<p>In <a>William Somerset Maugham</a>'s 1915 masterpiece novel <em><a>Of Human Bondage</a></em>, he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at the University of Heidelberg, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in 1934 (starring <a>Leslie Howard</a> as Philip, and <a>Bette Davis</a> as Mildred), 1946 (with <a>Paul Henreid</a> and <a>Eleanor Parker</a> in the lead roles), and 1964 (with <a>Laurence Harvey</a> and <a>Kim Novak</a> in the lead roles).</p>
<p>The 1927 silent film <em><a>The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg</a></em>, based on <a>Wilhelm Meyer-F&#x00f6;rster</a>'s play <em>Alt Heidelberg</em> (1903), starring <a>Ramon Novarro</a> and <a>Norma Shearer</a>, continued Mark Twain's image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper's daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era. <a>MGM</a>'s 1954 color remake <a>The Student Prince</a>, featuring <a>Mario Lanza</a>, is based on <a>Sigmund Romberg</a>'s <a>operetta version</a> of the story.</p>
<p>In <a>Bernhard Schlink</a>'s semi-autobiographical 1995 novel <em><a>The Reader</a></em>, Heidelberg University is one of the main scenes of part II. Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, Michael Berg, a law student at the university, re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crime trial, which he observes as part of a seminar. The university is also featured in the <a>Academy Award</a>-winning 2008 film version <a>The Reader</a>, starring <a>Kate Winslet</a>, <a>David Kross</a> and <a>Ralph Fiennes</a>.</p>
<p>In 2000, the university was the main scene of the <a>award-winning</a> German thriller <em><a>Anatomy</a></em>. The medical student Paula Henning (played by <a>Franka Potente</a>) wins a place in a summer course at the prestigious <a>Heidelberg Medical School</a>. When the body of a young man she met on the train turns up on her dissection table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, uncovering a gruesome conspiracy perpetrated by an antihippocratic secret society operating within the university.</p>
