<p>:<em>This page refers to a college in <a>Rhode Island</a>. For the college in <a>Manitoba</a>, see <a>Providence College and Theological Seminary</a>.</em>  <strong>Providence College</strong> is a private, <a>Catholic</a> <a>college</a> located about two miles west of downtown <a>Providence</a>, <a>Rhode Island</a>, the <a>state</a>'s capital city. With a 2010&ndash;2011 enrollment of 3,850 undergraduate students and 735 graduate students, the college is known for its programs in the <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>science</a>s. It is the only college or university in North America administered by the <a>Dominican Order</a> of Friars.</p>
<p>Founded in 1917, Providence College has been ranked by the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> as one of the top two regional (<a>master's</a> level) universities in the <a>Northeastern United States</a> since 1997. The College offers fifty majors and thirty-four minors and is one of the few schools in the country that requires all its students to complete 20 credits in the Development of Western Civilization, which serves as a major part of the college's core curriculum.</p>
<p>In <a>athletics</a>, Providence College competes in <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> and is a founding member of the <a>Big East Conference</a> and <a>Hockey East</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding of Providence College</h3>
<p>Providence College was founded as an all-male school in the year 1917 through the efforts of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the <a>Dominican Province of St. Joseph</a>, and with the blessing of Pope Benedict XV. The central figure in the college's incorporation was Bishop Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, who dreamed of an institution which would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The school opened its doors at the corner of Eaton Street and River Avenue in 1919 with only one building, Harkins Hall, which currently serves as the home of the school's administration and a classroom building. One of the oldest clubs at Providence, the Friars Club, was established in 1928 and still operates to this day (known by their signature white suit coats while at school events and while giving tours of the campus to prospective students). Soon after this Providence athletics soon received their moniker, as the &quot;Friars&quot; in black and white had early success in basketball, football, and baseball. PC conferred its first Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, and Master of Sciences degrees by 1935, the year when the school's newspaper (The Cowl) was first published.</p>
<h3>1946&#x2013;1961: Post-war success</h3>
<p>Robert J. Slavin, O.P. is perhaps the most influential and expansive president in College history. By 1951 he helped open Albertus Magnus Hall, the main science complex at Providence, oversaw the original Student Congress, dedicated the old War Memorial Grotto (to the PC students who gave the ultimate sacrifice in World War II as well as those who studied in the Army Specialized Training Program), listened to the first broadcasts from the campus radio station WDOM, organized Friar athletics into the <a>NCAA</a>, and established the College's ROTC chapter. In 1955, Slavin acquired property that pushed the boundaries of campus to Huxley Avenue; also, in addition to hiring <a>Joe Mullaney</a> as the men's basketball coach, Slavin opened <a>Alumni Hall</a> as the new home for Friars basketball instead of playing in local Providence high schools. The bond between the College and its basketball team is unbreakable due to the efforts of Slavin, and he was once quoted after a <a>NIT</a> quarterfinal upset over <a>Saint Louis University</a>, &quot;Seven hundred years of Dominican education and no one ever heard of us until we put five kids on the floor at <a>Madison Square Garden</a>.&quot; His efforts to promote the name of Providence to the country were fulfilled in 1961 when the Friars won their first NIT championship on the leadership of senior <a>Lenny Wilkens</a>; sadly, Slavin died only weeks after that victory and was buried in the Dominican cemetery located on campus along with his predecessor. The campus's student union is now named after Slavin to honor his service to PC.</p>
<h3>1961&#x2013;1965: The Dore era</h3>
<p>Vincent C. Dore, O.P. took over as president of the College soon after Slavin's death, and in his service until 1965, Dore opened the doors of the College's graduate school as well as a new dormitory building, now called Meagher Hall. Providence basketball took home its second NIT championship in 1963, and upon returning to Rhode Island nearly 10,000 students and fans lined Route 6 from the Connecticut state line to downtown Providence to get a glimpse of the returning Friars and their star <a>John Thompson</a>. Dore is commemorated today by a girls' dormitory bearing his namesake.</p>
<h3>1965&#x2013;1973: A time of change</h3>
<p>Dore was succeeded by William P. Haas, O.P. who helped bring Providence through a turbulent time at the end of the 1960s. Haas helped create two popular Providence traditions early in his presidency, Freshman Parents' Weekend and Junior Ring Weekend (JRW). Only months after the first JRW, Haas announced the establishment of the Study Abroad Program for eligible juniors, and after years of fundraising, Haas opened Phillips Memorial Library in 1969 to the students and faculty of the College. 1970 proved to be a controversial final year for Haas; not only did Providence decide to end its policy of being an all-male institution by allowing the admittance of women for the 1971-1972 school year, but students walked out of classes to protest the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in a nationwide phenomenon of campus activism. After stepping down at the end of 1970, Thomas R. Peterson, O.P. was elected as president of the College in 1971. Peterson started off his presidency with a bang by instituting the unique Development of Western Civilization program, organizing the first Freshman Orientation programs, and made Aquinas Hall the co-ed dormitory all in 1971. With the enrollment nearly doubling, Providence basketball tickets became a hot commodity at the cramped Alumni Hall gymnasium, and with the opening of the <a>Providence Civic Center</a> in 1972, the Friars moved downtown for a magical season (in 1976, the College moved commencement exercises to the Civic Center).</p>
<p>The men's basketball team went to the <a>Final Four</a> in the 1972-1973 season on the play and leadership of Providence natives <a>Ernie DiGregorio</a> and <a>Marvin Barnes</a>, while the women's basketball team played their inaugural season in Alumni Hall.  </p>
<p>Men's basketball again took center stage on the Providence campus, as coach <a>Rick Pitino</a> and senior <a>Billy Donovan</a> took the Friars to their second Final Four appearance in 1987. Cunningham used the exposure and fundraising opportunities to build two apartment-style residence halls on campus, providing an alternative to dormitory and off-campus housing for upperclassmen. Cunningham also promoted multicultural diversity and volunteer service during his time as president, holding the first Black History and Multicultural Awareness Celebrations while also organizing the first Urban Action program for incoming freshmen. Under Smith, the College received many accolades from national publications under Smith's leadership, such as top regional college (North) by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> beginning in 1997. Smith also oversaw the new influence of women's athletics at Providence, as several alumni and then-current tudents won the gold medal for <a>women's ice hockey</a> as part of the <a>U.S. national team</a> in the <a>1998 Winter Olympics</a> in <a>Nagano, Japan</a>. Also, in a very controversial decision, Smith stood by athletic director <a>John Marinatto</a> in ending the <a>baseball</a> program at Providence in order to comply with the provisions of <a>Title IX</a>.</p>
<h3>2005&#x2013;present: The Shanley era</h3>
<p>After Fr. Smith stepped down in 2005, Brian J. Shanley, O.P. was elected as president of the College. Shanley so far has overseen the renovations to St. Catherine of Siena Hall and the construction of the Concannon Fitness Center as part of an overall renovation to Alumni Hall. In 2009, Shanley oversaw the renovation and expansion of the Slavin Center, adding new student space, a coffee shop, and a new studio for the campus radio station. The School thus began the process of <a>accreditation</a> by the <a>AASCB</a>, which is expected to be completed by 2012.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> Located on  in the city's <a>Elmhurst</a> neighborhood atop <a>Smith Hill</a>, the highest point in the city of Providence.  The campus is divided by Huxley Avenue; buildings west of the road, around the summit of Smith Hill, are known as &quot;Upper Campus&quot; and those east, on the former Chapin Hospital property, are known as &quot;Lower Campus.&quot; There are three main gates to campus, at Cunningham Square (the intersection of River Avenue and Eaton Street) and on Huxley Avenue to the upper campus, and at the southeast corner of the lower campus, along Eaton Street. There are also two smaller gates, at Alumni Hall (at the corner of Wardlaw Ave. and Cumberland St.) and across from the Huxley Gate, accessing the lower campus (though this gate is used for service vehicles only inbound). The campus consists of nineteen academic and administrative buildings, nine dormitories, five apartment complexes, three residences, four athletic buildings, a Power Plant, a Physical Plant, and a Security Office gate house. There is also a cemetery, two quads, four athletic fields, a six-court tennis court, an artificial turf field, and several parking areas (including a structure below the turf field).</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Providence College comprises four schools:</p>
<h3>School of Arts &amp; Sciences</h3>
<p>The School of Arts &amp; Sciences was created in 2008 as part of the College's addition of a stand-alone School of Business. The School offers undergraduate degrees in <a>social science</a>s, <a>natural science</a>s, the <a>humanities</a>, and <a>fine arts</a>. It also offers graduate programs with <a>Masters of Arts</a> in History, Biblical Studies, Mathematics, and Theology, as well as a <a>Master of Theological Studies</a> degree.</p>
<h3>School of Business</h3>
<p>The School of Business was created in 2008 and immediately began the <a>accreditation</a> process for the <a>AASCB</a>. The school offers four undergraduate degrees, in <a>management</a>, <a>finance</a>, <a>accountancy</a>, and <a>marketing</a>, in addition to a <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA) graduate program. The School also offers a <a>certificate</a> program in business studies.</p>
<h3>School of Professional Studies</h3>
<p>The School of Professional Studies includes undergraduate and graduate degree programs in <a>education</a> and <a>special education</a>, <a>social work</a>, and <a>health policy</a>. It also offers a <a>certificate</a> program in special education administration.</p>
<h3>School of Continuing Education</h3>
<p>The School of Continuing Education offers courses to complete an <a>associate's degree</a> or <a>bachelor's degree</a> with programs including social sciences, theology, organizational studies, humanities, and liberal studies. In addition, it offers numerous <a>certificate</a> programs, including a Teacher Certification Program (TCP).</p>
<h3>Other programs</h3>
<h4>Liberal Arts Honors Program</h4>
<p>The Liberal Arts Honors Program was created in 1957 and accepts approximately the top 125 students in each freshman class, offering three levels of academic scholarships for participation in the program. Honors students take separate Development of Western Civilization courses with smaller classes, in addition to one or two honors-level classes in other programs and a capstone honors &quot;colloquium&quot; course.</p>
<h4>Development of Western Civilization</h4>
<p>The Development of Western Civilization (commonly referred to by students as &quot;Civ&quot;) program distinguishes Providence College from other liberal arts schools, and indeed, most colleges. The DWC program is a two year long program, required of all students attending the school, taken in students' first four semesters at the school. Meeting in Moore Hall, a lecture hall specifically redesigned for the course, the class meets 5 days a week, with one day being typically reserved for seminar work and/or exams. The class is taught by a team of professors, usually four - one who specializes in literature, one in theology, one in philosophy and one in history. Beginning at the beginning of history, students move through history, ending at present time when they have finished the two-year course. Original texts of philosophy, theology, and literature are used as the course progresses, and there are occasional music and art lectures as well. The goal is to give students a general well rounded knowledge of cultures development through history. The program is a very strong bond for students, since it is the only absolutely universal requirement of the college. Many students can identify with each other by what &quot;team&quot; of teachers they had (although the teams usually change slightly from year to year and, rarely, from semester to semester).</p>
<p>There is a tradition which has grown over time from the course called &quot;Civ Scream.&quot; The event takes place the night before DWC final exams, and is usually centered on the &quot;quad&quot; area between Aquinas, Meagher, and McDermott Halls. It is intended to be a harmless gathering to let off steam from the long hours of studying for the intense course's final exam, and is completely unsanctioned. The &quot;Civ Scream&quot; can become loud with wild behavior. Over the past few years, Providence College has begun to monitor and govern the event with enhanced coverage from the Office of Safety and Security and with assistance from the Providence Police Department.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Providence Friars logo</a> The school's 19 varsity men's and women's sports teams are called the <em><a>Friar</a>s</em>, after the Dominican Catholic order that runs the school. They are the only collegiate team to use the name. All teams participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> and in the <a>Big East Conference</a>, except for the men's and women's <a>ice hockey</a> programs, which compete in <a>Hockey East</a> and the women's volleyball program, which competes in the <a>America East Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The school's current athletic director is Robert Driscoll. The team colors are black and white, the same as the <a>Dominicans</a>, with silver as an accent color. The school's current logos and identity marks were released in 2002, and feature the profile of a friar wearing the black cappa (hood) of the Dominicans, above the word mark. All teams use the primary logo except the hockey teams, which have used the famous &quot;skating Friar&quot; logo since 1973. In addition to the Friar mascot, the school's animal mascot was a <a>Dalmatian</a> named &quot;Friar Boy.&quot; The school's closest rivalries are <a>Boston University</a> and <a>Boston College</a> in hockey and <a>UConn</a> and <a>URI</a> in the school's other sports, especially in soccer, swimming and diving, and basketball.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p> Friars men's basketball has a storied history in NCAA Division I basketball and is an original member of the <a>Big East</a> Conference, a conference created by a group led by former Providence coach <a>Dave Gavitt</a> and headquartered in Providence. The Friars play their home games at the 13,000 seat <a>Dunkin' Donuts Center</a> in downtown Providence, a facility that underwent an $80 million renovation completed in 2008. The arena can be a difficult arena to play in for opponents due to raucous fans and a boisterous student section. Despite having the smallest enrollment of any Big East school, the Friars have routinely averaged over 10,000 fans per game during the 30-plus year history of the facility, all while earning postseason berths and placing many players in the <a>National Basketball Association</a>. In addition to producing NBA players, former Friars players and coaches have also gone on to become basketball icons in the coaching world, such as <a>Rick Pitino</a>, <a>Billy Donovan</a>, <a>Lenny Wilkens</a>, <a>Pete Gillen</a>, <a>Rick Barnes</a>, and <a>John Thompson</a>.</p>
<p>Providence College won the 1961 and 1963 <a>NIT</a> championship and participated in the 1973 and 1987 <a>Final Four</a>, and the 1997 squad advanced to the NCAA <a>Elite Eight</a>. Overall, the team has 15 <a>NCAA basketball tournament</a> berths and 16 <a>NIT</a> berths, as well as twenty four basketball All-Americans.</p>
<h2>Marks and seals</h2>
<p>The college's graphic identity represents the shape of a window in Harkins Hall with a flame inside, representing <em><a>Veritas</a></em>, or <em>Truth</em>, the official college motto. The college motto was borrowed from the <a>Dominican Order</a>, and has been used since the college's inception.</p>
<p>The official seal of Providence College is an ornate triangle, representing the <a>Trinity</a>, with the flame of learning and a scroll with the College Motto, <em>Veritas,</em> superimposed on it. The seal is surrounded by a ring with the words <em>Sigillum Collegii Providentiensis</em> (&quot;Seal of Providence College&quot;) inside it.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
<p> Alumni of Providence College include successful individuals from a wide range of fields such as politics, business, medicine, and athletics. Two <a>Basketball Hall of Fame</a> players or coaches have graduated from Providence College: <a>Lenny Wilkens</a> and <a>John Thompson</a>. In addition, two-time <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> champion, <a>Florida Gators men's basketball</a> head coach <a>Billy Donovan</a>, graduated from Providence College.</p>
