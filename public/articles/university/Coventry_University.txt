<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Frederick Lanchester Building housing the library</a> Coventry University has a long tradition as a provider of education. It can trace its roots as far back as Coventry College of Design in 1843. It was in 1970 that Coventry College of Art amalgamated with Lanchester College of Technology and Rugby College of Engineering Technology. The resulting institution was called Lanchester Polytechnic: 'Lanchester' after the Midlands automotive industry pioneer, Dr <a>Frederick Lanchester</a>. In 1987 the name changed to Coventry Polytechnic and in 1992 it adopted the title Coventry University. </p>
<ul>
  <li>1829 <a>Mechanics Institute</a>: merges with the <a>Religious and Useful Knowledge Society</a> in 1835; becomes the <a>Coventry Institute</a> in 1855, merges with the new <a>Technical Institute</a> in 1902 and becomes the <a>Lanchester College of Technology</a> in 1960.</li>
  <li>1929 <a>Rugby College of Technology and Arts</a>: work divided between <a>Lanchester College of Technology</a> and <a>Rugby College of Engineering Technology</a> in 1960.</li>
  <li>1843 <a>Coventry College of Design</a>: becomes <a>Coventry School of Art</a>, 1852, and transfers science classes to the <a>Technical Institute</a> in 1888, becomes <a>Municipal School of Art</a> in 1902, and is designated <a>College of Art</a> in 1954.</li>
  <li>1970 Merge of all three of the above (Lanchester College of Technology, Rugby College of Engineering Technology and College of Art) leads to Lanchester Polytechnic.</li>
  <li>1987 Coventry Polytechnic</li>
  <li>1992 Coventry University</li>
</ul>
<p>Between 1970 and 1987 the institution's name (then Lanchester Polytechnic) caused a certain degree of confusion as it was occasionally mistaken for both <a>Manchester Polytechnic</a> and <a>Lancaster University</a>, whilst there is also a small town in <a>Co. Durham</a> called <a>Lanchester</a>. The history of the institution is explored in its new publication The Phoenix Rises.</p>

<h2>Logo</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Alan Berry Building and pedestrian area, situated opposite Coventry Cathedral</a> The University's logo designed by A. Faris shows a <a>phoenix</a>, a mythical bird with splendid plumage, reputed to live in the <a>Arabian Desert</a>. Fabled to be the only one of its kind, it lived for five or six centuries, after which it burned itself to death on a funeral pyre of aromatic twigs ignited by the sun and fanned by its own wings. It rose from the ashes with renewed youth to live through another cycle. Such a symbol is a fitting reminder of the way in which the <a>City of Coventry</a> rebuilt itself after suffering devastation during the <a>Second World War</a>. It is a symbol with which Coventry University is proud to be associated and to have adopted as its own. In the summer of 2006 the symbol was flipped on its vertical axis in order to portray the head of the phoenix looking to the right. The reason behind the decision was the desire to portray the university as looking forward rather than back. As such all of the signs on the campus buildings were removed and replaced with new stainless steel ones in which the phoenix looked right. The difference can be seen on this page. The logo to the top right of this page is the revised logo (post 2006). In the picture of Coventry University's main building, the Alan Berry Building to the right, the logo is pre-2006, as the building predates the change of logo.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

In addition, Coventry University Advanced Digitising and Modelling Laboratory opened in December 2002 and is formally known as the <a>Bugatti</a> Building. It provides full-sized vehicle design and styling facilities and is the only resource of its kind in the world attached to a university. The University has a &#x00a3;20&nbsp;million library that has won awards for its highly innovative interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building.</p>
<p>One of the most recent additions to the campus is an <a>aerospace</a> laboratory, which features a <a>Harrier Jump Jet</a> and <a>Scout helicopter</a>. </p>
<p>Another development for both the University and for the city has been the creation of the  Coventry University Technology Park. It is home to the TechnoCentre, a unique complex offering a focus for training, conferences and business opportunities; the Enterprise Centre, a &#x00a3;3&nbsp;million development providing dedicated accommodation for new small- and medium-sized enterprises; and the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology.</p>
