<p><strong>Murray State University</strong>, located in the city of <a>Murray</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>, is an approximately 10,000-student, four-year public university. Murray State maintains a strong academic reputation and has been rewarded with high marks when compared with other regional public universities in <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> and other college ranking publications. The school is Kentucky&#x2019;s only public university to be listed in the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> regional university top tier for the past 18 consecutive years (non-doctoral degree granting universities).  In addition to the main campus, Murray State University operates extended campuses offering upper level and graduate courses in Paducah, Hopkinsville, Madisonville, and Henderson.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of Murray State University can be traced to the passage of Senate Bill 14 by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which would create two <a>normal school</a>s to address the growing demand for professional teachers.  One of these schools would be in the western part of the state, which caused many cities and towns to bid for the new normal school.  <a>Rainey T. Wells</a> spoke on behalf of the city of Murray to convince the Normal School Commission to choose his city.  On September 2, 1922, Murray was chosen as the site of the new western normal school, and <a>Morehead</a> was chosen as the site for the eastern normal school.  On November 26, 1922, John Wesley Carr was elected as the first president of the <a>Murray State Normal School</a> by the State Board of Education.  At the same time, the Normal School Commission, under the belief that it had the right to elect the first president, elected Rainey T. Wells. May 15, 1923, The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the decision made by the State Board of Education, and Carr would be the first president.</p>
<p>Opening day for Murray State Normal School was September 23, 1923.  Until the first building was completed, now Wrather Hall, the Normal School held classes on the first floor of Murray High School.  All students commuted to classes until the first dormitory was constructed in 1925 as Wells Hall.  Wilson Hall was also completed under Carr's presidency, and other structures were in progress.  In 1926, Rainey T. Wells, recognized as the founder of Murray State, also became the second president.  Wells served as president from 1926 to 1932, and during this time Lovett Auditorium, Carr Health Building, and Pogue library were all completed.  In 1926, the Normal School was also renamed to Murray State Normal School and Teachers College when the General Assembly granted the institution authority to confer baccalaureate degrees.  In 1928, the college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and in 1930 the name was changed to Murray State Teachers College when the school was granted authority to offer liberal arts and preprofessional courses.  The name was changed again in 1948 to Murray State College, and then in 1966 the General Assembly authorized the Board of Regents to change the name to Murray State University.</p>
<h3>The Shield</h3>
<p>The Shield is the official seal of the University. It is taken from the heraldic coat-of-arms of the family of <a>William Murray</a>, Earl of Mansfield and Lord Chief Justice of Great Britain in 1756. William Murray is an ancestor of the Murray family from whom the city and the University take their names. The shield is blue with a double gold border, and the three stars represent hope, endeavor, and achievement.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>The Quad</h3>
<p><a>thumb|300px|right|Pogue Library and the quadrangle, featuring the statue of founder Rainey T. Wells.</a> The oldest and most easily recognizable buildings on the Murray State campus are situated around a large, grassy, tree-lined area on the south side of campus.  This part of campus, known as the quadrangle, is bounded by 16th Street to the West, 15th Street to the East, <a>Lovett Auditorium</a> to the North, and Wilson Hall to the South.  In the Southwest corner of the quad sits the oldest building on campus, Wrather Hall.  Wrather Hall first housed administrative offices and classrooms, and it is now home to the Wrather West Kentucky Museum and a large auditorium that is frequently used for lectures and meetings.  Faculty Hall, Wells Hall, and the College of Business line the western edge of the quad.  The Lowry Center, <a>Pogue Library</a>, and the <a>Price Doyle Fine Arts Center</a> line the eastern side of the quad.  The 11-story Doyle Fine Arts Center is the tallest building on campus, housing the Robert E. Johnson Theatre, Clara Eagle Art Gallery, WKMS-FM and MSU-TV 11 studios, as wells as numerous classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls.  Directly south of the quad is Sparks Hall.  Sparks Hall is the main administrative building, housing the offices of student financial aid, admissions and registration, accounting and financial services, vice president for administrative services, center for continuing education and academic outreach, human resources, marketing and public relations, and school relations.  The 6-story, , Sparks Hall was completed in 1967 at a cost of $1,308,514.  Also to the south of the quad, and directly west of Sparks Hall is Oakhurst, which is the residence of the university president.  Oakhurst was constructed in 1927, by Murray State's second president, Rainey T. Wells.</p>
<h3>Central campus</h3>
<p>The central portion of the Murray State campus lines 15th Street between Chestnut Street and Olive Boulevard.  This portion of 15th Street was originally open to automobile traffic, but it has since been closed and converted into a pedestrian thoroughfare.  Along the west side of the 15th Street pedestrian pathway is the Martha Layne Collins Center for Industry and Technology, Blackburn Science Building, and Oakley Applied Science Building.  To the east of the pedestrian pathway lies the <a>Curris Center</a>, Carr Health Building and Cutchin Fieldhouse, <a>Waterfield Library</a>, Ordway Hall, Woods Hall, and Mason Hall.</p>
<h3>West campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Alexander Hall, named for former Murray State president Kern Alexander</a> An aggressive building campaign on campus has resulted in a westward expansion of the main academic campus of Murray State.  The expansion began with a massive renovation and expansion of what is now known as Alexander Hall on the west side of 16th Street near Calloway Avenue.  The project was the first to unveil a new architectural style that would become consistent through all renovation and new construction projects on campus.  Alexander Hall is home to Murray State's Adolescent, Career and Special Education program.  Construction continued with the new state-of-the-art science complex for biology, chemistry and engineering that is located just to the southwest of Alexander Hall.  The massive new science complex was constructed in phases, with the biology building opening in 2004 and the rest of the complex and centerpiece clock tower reaching final completion in March 2008.  The new clock tower was dedicated in 2007 as the Jesse L. Jones Family Clock Tower.</p>
<h3>Sports and recreation facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Roy Stewart Stadium</a> The majority of the university's sports and recreation facilities are located on the northern most edge of the campus, along the KY-121 Bypass.  The most prominent structure in the sports complex is <a>Roy Stewart Stadium</a>.  The stadium, which is home field to the Murray State Racers football program, was completed in 1973 and named for former Murray State football coach Roy Stewart.  It seats 16,800.  The outdated AstroTurf surface was replaced with <a>FieldTurf</a> in 2007.  Located on the second floor of the seven-story press box and seating structure is the Pat Spurgin Rifle Range, which is the home of the three-time NCAA champion rifle squad.  The 8,602-seat <a>CFSB Center</a> was completed in 1998 to replace the aging Racer Arena that was no longer large enough to serve as an adequate home to the men's and women's basketball teams.  On April 16, 2005, the new Susan E. Bauernfeind Student Recreation and Wellness Center was dedicated.  The new  student recreation center includes a swimming pool, two racquetball courts, a walking/jogging track, an aerobic studio, basketball courts, and free weights and cardio workout machines.  The center is located just north of the residential colleges, near Roy Stewart Stadium.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>Currently, a building campaign has begun to replace many of the aging residence halls. A replacement building for Clark College was completed and ready for residents at the beginning of the 2007 Fall semester. This made Clark College the newest building, and the only residence hall specifically designed around the residential college concept and model. Another new residential college has now been constructed. J.H. Richmond College opened in Fall 2009. It has the same concept and design as Clark College. In the fall of 2009 old Clark College was torn down.</p>
<h2>Your World To Explore</h2>
<p>Murray State recently adopted a new moniker, &quot;Your World to Explore.&quot;  Since the moniker's inception the University has implemented a campaign to showcase the slogan.</p>
<p>Murray State's previous self-adopted moniker &quot;Kentucky's Public Ivy&quot; came with some criticism.  The term <a>Public Ivy</a> is generally used to describe state-funded institutions of higher learning that excel on a national level and successfully compete with the <a>Ivy League</a> schools in academic rigor.  Such institutions have been discussed by name in several books, and Murray State was not named in those publications.  Murray State used the term to emphasize its ambition to maintain a strong academic reputation and high marks when compared with other regional public universities, as well as its emulation of some of the institutional features of certain Ivy League schools, including a <a>residential college</a> system (discussed below). Murray State eventually dropped the &quot;Public Ivy&quot; branding from its website in December 2008.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Murray State University offers 11 associate, 64 bachelor's, and 42 master's and specialist programs, which are administered through five academic colleges, one school, 30 departments, and one joint program shared by the College of Business and Public Affairs together with the Department of Industrial and Engineering Technology.  The College of Business and Public Affairs is the largest college, enrolling 23% of undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Murray State has been institutionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and School, Commission on Colleges, continuously since 1928.  Murray State is one of only eight schools in the state of Kentucky to achieve <a>AACSB</a> accreditation of business programs; however the school is not AACSB accredited in Accounting programs. Several other programs have achieved specialized accreditation - primarily programs in teaching, fine arts, and nursing.  As a former <a>normal school</a> and teachers college, Murray State is best known for its NCATE-accredited education programs, but the university has also gained national recognition for its fine arts programs.  The Department of Music has been a member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1936.</p>
<p>Murray State University offers a wide range of majors, minors, and areas of study, many of which are not commonly found at Colleges and Universities similar to MSU in size. These include: </p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<h3>Residential colleges</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Elizabeth Residential College</a> Murray State was the first public university in the nation to adopt a successful campus-wide <a>residential college</a> program [<a>http://www.murraystate.edu/campus/residential_colleges/index.htm</a>].  The residential college structure, which took form on the campus in 1996, is based on similar, but much more established, programs at the Universities of <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a> as well as <a>Yale University</a>, <a>Harvard College</a> and <a>Princeton University</a> in the United States. </p>
<p>The Murray State model lacks several critical components of the classical residential college model, including dining halls and libraries at each college, sufficient common meeting areas for activities, group study, and academic training, and large courtyards or outdoor spaces for socializing and recreation. The Murray State model still forces students to share central dining areas and recreation areas, and the current buildings also lack significant common space that would be utilized for a variety of functions.  This weakness causes the residential colleges to lose some of their sense of envisioned identity, and they remain to many as just dormitories that happen to each have a coat of arms. As the older structures are eventually phased out, the university is taking steps to design new residence halls with the residential college model in mind.</p>
<p>Although the physical structures of Murray State's residential colleges do not compare to those of the elite institutions, the basic residential college concept was implemented.  All faculty, staff, and students, even those who live off-campus, are assigned to one of the eight residential colleges.  Once assigned to a residential college, a person remains a member of that college throughout their time at the University, developing friendships, traditions and lasting bonds that are meant to endure years after leaving Murray State. One of the goals in establishing the program was to improve student life and retention and graduation rates, and measurable progress has been made in that endeavor.  </p>
<p>The eight colleges of Murray State</p>
<ol>
  <li><a>Clark College</a>, named for Lee Clark, who assisted Rainey T. Wells in founding the University. Clark later served as the superintendent of grounds and buildings. The current Clark residence hall opened in August 2007 as the first new residence hall built on campus since 1970.  The new Clark is the first residence hall at Murray to be specifically designed to support the residential college concept. </li>
  <li><a>Elizabeth College</a>, named for Elizabeth Harkless Woods, wife of fourth Murray State President Ralph H. Woods.</li>
  <li><a>Hart College</a>, named for George Hart, a Board of Regents member and former mayor of Murray.</li>
  <li><a>Hester College</a>, named for Cleo Gillis Hester, who served Murray State University from 1927 to 1960, as registrar. </li>
  <li><a>Regents College</a>, named in honor of the outstanding citizens who have served on Murray State University&#x2019;s Board of Regents. Regents Hall was completed in 1970.</li>
  <li><a>Richmond College</a>, named for the third president of the University, James H. Richmond.</li>
  <li><a>Springer-Franklin College</a>, named for O.B. Springer,  member of the Board of Regents from 1950&#x2013;58 and 1960&#x2013;70, and Hollis C. Franklin, who served on the Board from 1947-56.</li>
  <li><a>White College</a>, named for R.H. &quot;Bob&quot; White, a Board of Regents member.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student Government Association</h3>
<p>The <a>Student Government Association</a>, commonly known as SGA, is the officially organized body governing all students and student organizations at Murray State University.  The purposes of the <a>Student Government Association</a> are to promote the welfare, growth, and development of student life in an environment of academic excellence, to represent the students in all phases of administrative effort, and to provide a means of promoting cooperative efforts for the general welfare of the University community.  SGA is made up four branches: Senate, Campus Activities Board, Judicial Board, and the Residential College Association.  The Senate is the main branch of SGA, and it is the governing body with the power to pass resolutions, bills, rules, and regulations necessary for the general welfare of the University and to implement and maintain any programs consistent with SGA purposes.    The president of SGA holds a student seat on the Board of Regents.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>Murray State is home to active chapters of several social Greek organizations.  The oldest fraternities on campus are <a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> and <a>Sigma Alpha Iota</a> (both relating to music).  For the 2006-2007 academic year, 873 students were involved with Greek life (10.4% of undergraduates).</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Alma Mater</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; The Alma Mater of Murray State University is sung to the tune of <a>Annie Lisle</a> and has two verses. Words were written by A.B. Austin, Dean of Men, in 1935.  The Alma Mater is traditionally sung at student orientation, convocation and commencement ceremonies, athletic events, and other special events on campus.</p>
<p><strong><em>All-Campus Sing</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; All-Campus Sing is an annual event, first held in 1958, that takes place each April in which residential colleges, fraternities, sororities, and other student organizations compete in choreographed song and dance. The event is hosted by the Iota Beta chapter of <a>Sigma Alpha Iota</a> (original organizer of the event), in conjunction with the MSU Alumni Association and the Office of Student Affairs.  It's held on the steps of historic Lovett Auditorium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Campus Lights</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; Campus Lights is the longest running student produced and performed musical in the South.  The show started in 1938 by the Gamma Delta chapter of <a>Phi Mu Alpha</a> as a fund raiser to pay the chapter's chartering fees.  Campus Lights is now produced by a joint effort of the Gamma Delta chapter of Phi Mu Alpha and the Iota Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota. All proceeds from the show are given to the Department of Music in order to fund scholarships.</p>
<p><strong><em>Racer One</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; In 1976, the tradition of having a thoroughbred run around the track after every MSU football touchdown began.  The name of that first racehorse was Violet Cactus.  After the death of Violet Cactus in 1984, the horse Nancy Duster took over the job for one year.  Violet Cactus is actually buried at Roy Stewart Stadium near the area where Racer One begins its run around the football field after a Racer touchdown.  In 1985, the first Racer One began circling the football field after touchdowns.  Several horses have filled the role of Racer One since  1985.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shoe Tree</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; Located in front of Pogue Library on the quad is a tree with many pairs of shoes nailed to the trunk.  The tradition is that if a couple gets married after meeting at Murray State, then they return to the quad and each one nails a shoe to the &quot;shoe tree.&quot;  Many of the shoes include names and dates written on them. If the couple has a baby, the baby's shoes are then nailed to the tree. It should be noted that this tree (due to a high zinc content from the nails) is a common target of lightning, and has caught fire in the past.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>120px|right</a> Murray State's men's and women's athletic teams are known as the Racers, with the exception of the baseball team which is known as the Thoroughbreds. All of its athletic teams compete in the <a>Ohio Valley Conference</a>, whose conference roster includes 10 other regional public universities.</p>
<p>Murray State is particularly renowned for its men's basketball program, which has made 14 appearances in the <a>NCAA</a> Tournament, most recently in <a>2010</a>. As a 13 seed, Murray State won their second ever NCAA tournament game on a buzzer beater against 4th seeded Vanderbilt. Former <a>Alabama</a> head basketball coach <a>Mark Gottfried</a> coached the Racers to three Ohio Valley Conference Championships, all three years he coached there, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.. The basketball program has been recognized as one of the top 30 basketball programs in modern history by ESPN..</p>
<p>Murray State also is home to one of the nation's top rifle programs. The Racers claimed national championships in 1978 (NRA), 1985 (<a>NCAA</a>) and 1987 (NCAA) and have produced six individual <a>NCAA</a> national champions, including two-time national titlist and <a>1984 Summer Olympics</a> gold medalist <a>Pat Spurgin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>football</a> program has become a steppingstone to major-college coaching success. <a>Frank Beamer</a>, the current <a>Virginia Tech</a> head coach who built that program into a national power in the 1990s and early 2000s, and current <a>Ole Miss</a> head coach <a>Houston Nutt</a> are both former Racers head coaches. Current <a>Maryland</a> head coach <a>Ralph Friedgen</a> is a former Racers assistant under Beamer, and current <a>Illinois</a> head coach <a>Ron Zook</a> was an assistant under current <a>ESPN</a> college football analyst <a>Mike Gottfried</a>, who was Beamer's predecessor as head coach.</p>
<h2>Publications</h2>
<p><strong><em>The Murray State News</em></strong>&lt;br/&gt; <em>The Murray State News</em> is the student newspaper of Murray State University.  The newspaper has been the recipient of several <a>ACP Pacemaker awards</a>, the highest award given to collegiate newspapers.  The  most recent awards were earned in 2004, 1999, and 1998.
