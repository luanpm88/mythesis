<p>The <strong>University of Saskatchewan</strong> (<strong>U of S</strong>) is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> <a>research university</a>, founded in 1907, and located on the east side of the <a>South Saskatchewan River</a> in <a>Saskatoon</a>, <a>Saskatchewan</a>, Canada. The <em>University of Saskatchewan Act</em> was passed by the <a>Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan</a> in 1995. It established the provincial university on April 3, 1907 &quot;for the purpose of providing facilities for <a>higher education</a> in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage&quot;. The University of Saskatchewan is now the largest education institution in the Canadian <a>province</a> of <a>Saskatchewan</a>.</p>
<p>The university began as an agricultural college in 1907 and established the first Canadian university-based department of extension in 1910.  were set aside for university buildings and  for the U of S farm, and agricultural fields. In total 10.32&nbsp;km&#x00b2; was annexed for the university. Currently, main University campus is situated upon  with another 500&nbsp;acres (2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to neighbouring urban research lands. University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals. Since its origins as an agricultural college, <a>research</a> has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the <a>cobalt-60</a> cancer therapy unit. The university currently offers over <a>200 academic programs</a>. Duncan P. McColl was appointed as the first registrar, establishing the first convocation from which Chief Justice <a>Edward L. Wetmore</a> was elected as the first chancellor. <a>Walter Charles Murray</a> became the first president of the university's board of governors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The eastern fa&#x00e7;ade of the Academic Health Sciences Building prior to the construction of the E-Wing.</a></p>
<p>The institution was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The <a>University</a> was created on April 3, 1907 by a provincial statute known as the <em>University Act</em>. It provided for a publicly funded, yet independent institution to be created for the citizens of the whole province.</p>
<p>The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.  In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.</p>
<p>The University of Saskatchewan<code>s Arms were registered with the <a>Canadian Heraldic Authority</a> on February 15, 2001.</code></p>
<h3>Campus</h3>
<p><a>National Historic Site</a> located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan</p>
<p>A location next to the <a>South Saskatchewan River</a>, across from the <a>city centre</a> of Saskatoon, was selected for the <a>campus</a>. The <a>Prime Minister of Canada</a>, <a>Sir Wilfrid Laurier</a>, laid the cornerstone of the first building, the <a>College Building</a>, on July 29, 1910. Brown and Vallance were the initial architects constructing the first university buildings in <a>Collegiate Gothic style</a>. The original buildings were built using native <a>limestone</a> &ndash; greystone &ndash; which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, the greystone was to become one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall Stone, so called because it is quarried at Tyndall, Manitoba. The first building to be started on the new campus, the <a>College Building</a>, built 1910- 1912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada    The Old Stone School, built in 1887, was declared a National Historic Site of Canada  </p>
<p>Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. <a>Walter Scott</a>.</pre>
<p>[[Image:CollegeBuilding-UofS.jpg|thumb|right|[[College Building (Saskatchewan)|College Building]]]] The original architectural plan called for the university buildings to be constructed around a green space known as <em>the bowl</em>. Currently, the original university buildings are being connected by skywalks and tunnels. Clockwise, from the north; Thorvaldson Building (August 22, 1924) (Spinks addition); Geology, W.P. Thompson Biology (1960) adjoined to Physics Building (1921); College Building (May 1, 1913) (Administration addition); Saskatchewan cojoined with Athabasca Hall (1964); Qu'Appelle Hall (1916); Marquis Hall adjoined to Place Riel &ndash; Qu'Appelle Addition; Murray Memorial Main Library (1956); Arts (1960) cojoined with Law and adjoined to Commerce building complete the initial circle around the perimeter of the bowl.</pre>
<h3>Establishment of colleges</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Entrance to Thorvaldson Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan</a>  Roughly adhering to the original plan of 1909, numerous colleges were established: <a>Arts &amp; Science</a> (1909), <a>Agriculture</a> now called Agriculture and Bioresource (1912), <a>Engineering</a> (1912), <a>Law</a> (1913), <a>Pharmacy now called Pharmacy &amp; Nutrition</a> (1914), <a>Commerce</a> now the N. Murray Edwards School of Business (1917), <a>Medicine</a> (1926), <a>Education</a> (1927), Home Economics (1928), <a>Nursing</a> (1938), <a>Graduate Studies and Research</a> (1946), <a>Physical Education</a> now called Kinesiology (1958), <a>Veterinary Medicine</a> (1964), <a>Dentistry</a>(1965), and <a>School of Physical Therapy</a> (1976).</p>
<p>The U of S also has several graduate programs amongst these colleges, which give rise to a masters or doctorate degree. In 1966, the University of Saskatchewan introduced a masters program in adult education. Diploma, and certificate post secondary courses are also available to aid in professional development.</pre>
<p><a>thumb|right|Entrance to the Field Husbandry &gt; Crop Science &gt; Anthropology &amp; Archaeology Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan</a> Theological Colleges, affiliated with the university, were also established: <a>Emmanuel College</a> &ndash; (Anglican denomination) (1909), St. Andrew's College (as <em><a>Presbyterian</a> College, Saskatoon</em>) then <a>United Church of Canada</a> (1913), <a>Lutheran Theological Seminary</a> (1920), <a>St. Thomas More College</a> (1936), and <a>Central Pentecostal College</a> (1983). </p>
<p>Regina College was saved from bankruptcy and became part of the university in 1934, and was given degree-granting privileges in 1959, making it a second University of Saskatchewan campus. By another act of legislation in 1974, Regina College was made an independent institution known as the <a>University of Regina</a>.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities.</p>
<h3>Land holdings</h3>
<p>Up until the late 1980s, the University of Saskatchewan held an extensive area of land in the northeast quadrant of Saskatoon, stretching far beyond the core campus, east of Preston Avenue and north of the <a>Sutherland</a> and <a>Forest Grove</a> subdivisions. Much of this land was used for farming, though some areas were intended for future campus and facility development. In the late 1980s, most U of S land beyond Circle Drive was earmarked for residential development; <a>Silverspring</a> was the first of these neighbourhoods to be developed. <a>thumb|right|<em>The Bowl</em> located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan</a> <a>thumb|right|Saskatchewan Hall is a student residence</a> <a>thumb|right| U of Saskatchewan Huskies football</a> <a>thumb|right| Royal University Hospital (1955 Wing)</a> <a>thumb|right|U of S Cobalt Therapy Unit</a> Another section of land, west of the Preston Avenue/Circle Drive interchange and north of the <a>CPR</a> line, was zoned for commercial use, and led to &quot;big box&quot; retail development in the early 2000s called <a>Preston Crossing</a>). Realignment of two major roads in the area around this same time (Preston Avenue and 108th Street) also used up a portion of university land. The U of S now maintains a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits that it obtained after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land. The U of S leased a site to the [[Correctional Service of Canada]] north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Drive.</pre>
<p>In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the &quot;green belt&quot; offered by the university led to these plans being dropped. </p>

<h2>Students and alumni</h2>
<p> The <em>University Act</em> provided that the University should provide &quot;facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage&quot;. It further stated that &quot;no woman shall by reason of her sex be deprived of any advantage or privilege accorded to the male students of the university.&quot; Seventy students began the first classes on September 28, 1909. The first class graduated on May 1, 1912. Of the three students who earned graduation honours, two were women.</pre>
<p>342 students, faculty, and staff enlisted for <a>World War I</a>. Of these, 67 were killed, 100 were wounded, and 33 were awarded medals of valour.</pre>
<p>Between 1907 and 2007 there have been over 132,200 members of the <a>University of Saskatchewan Alumni Association</a>. The alumni feature those who have successfully graduated from a degree, certificate and/or diploma programme at the University of Saskatchewan.</pre>

<h2>Distinguished research</h2>
<p>Over the years, some of the most prominent projects at the University have been associated with the Department of Physics. In 1948, the university built the first <a>betatron</a> facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial [[cobalt-60 (isotope)|cobalt-60]] therapy unit was constructed. (The first female Chancellor of the University, [[Sylvia Fedoruk]], was a member of the Cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] from 1988&ndash;1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a [[linear accelerator]] as part of the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]] in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for [[synchrotron light]] research, the [[Canadian Light Source]]. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size of a football field. The [[Plasma Physics Laboratory (Saskatchewan)|Plasma Physics Laboratory]] operates a [[tokamak]] on campus.  The University used the [[SCR-270 radar]] in 1949 to image the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]] for the first time.</pre>
<p>The university owns the <a>Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization</a>. [[Innovation Place Research Park]] is an industrial science and technology park that hosts private industry working with the university.</pre>
<h2>Royal connections</h2>
<p>[[Image:Sylvia Fedoruk.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Lieutenant Governor [[Sylvia Fedoruk]] was Chancellor of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon from 1986-1989.]]</p>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Saskatchewan has numerous royal and vice-regal connections. Lieutenant Governor <a>Archibald McNab</a> is credited with bringing the institution to Saskatoon. Its campuses have been venues for royal and vice-regal visits, including visits by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who lodged at the President's Residence in 1978. A handful of University alumni were invited to a reception for Canadians at [[Buckingham Palace]] ahead of that visit to Saskatoon. The main campus is home to Saskatoon's only royally designated institution, the [[Royal University Hospital]]. The Diefenbaker Canada Centre, also on campus, houses original correspondence between the Queen and Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]], and has staged such exhibits as ''Happy and Glorious: The Royal Presence in Canada'', opened by Lieutenant Governor [[Lynda Haverstock]] in 2004. The campus was the first in Western Canada to host the [[Vanier Cup]], named for Governor General [[Georges Vanier]], in 2006. Fifteen fellows of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] are affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan.</pre>
<p>Saskatchewan's <a>Lieutenant Governors</a> have filled the office of <strong>Visitor to the University of Saskatchewan</strong> since its establishment. Former Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Lake was famously called upon to assume the visitor's role in the so-called <em>Crisis of 1919</em>. Four senior members of the Board of Governors had been dismissed after three among them abstained from a vote of confidence in university president <a>Walter Murray</a>. Murray was under scrutiny for his maintenance of University finances. The public and press clamoured for an explanation, and, in accordance with provincial law, Lake held a series of hearings through the office of the <a>King&#x2019;s Bench</a>. His findings, delivered in April 1920, vindicated the dismissals, saying they were &#x201c;regular, proper and in the best interest of the university.&#x201d; In other words, their acts of disloyalty were enough to cost them their jobs.</p>
<p>Certain vice-regal representatives have held teaching and governance positions on campus. Before becoming Lieutenant Governor, <a>Gordon Barnhart</a> was university secretary and professor in Canadian politics. <a>Sylvia Fedoruk</a> was university chancellor, professor in oncology and associate member in physics. <a>Grant MacEwan</a>, before becoming Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, was director of the School of Agriculture and professor of animal husbandry at the University of Saskatchewan. Honorary <a>Doctor of Laws</a> degrees have been conferred by the university on vice-regal representatives. Recipient Lieutenant Governors include <a>William Patterson</a> in 1955, <a>Robert Hanbidge</a> in 1968, <a>Stephen Worobetz</a> in 1984 and <a>Sylvia Fedoruk</a> in 2006. Recipient Governors General include <a>Vincent Massey</a> in 1955 and <a>Ramon Hnatyshyn</a> in 1990.</p>
<h2>University administration</h2>
<p>There are three separate areas of governance at the University of Saskatchewan. Financial, management, as well as administration affairs are handled by the Board of Governors, which comprises 11 members. The University of Saskatchewan liaison between the public and professional sector is dealt with by the university Senate, a body of 100 representatives. Finally, the General Academic Assembly is the university's advisory body wherein, all the faculty members and elected students combine to determine academic policies and direction. In 1995, the General Academic Assembly is represented by elected members to the University of Saskatchewan Council which is made up of a combination of 116 faculty and students. As of 2006, faculty and staff total 7,000, and student enrolment comprised 15,005 full time students as well as 3,552 part time students.</pre>
<p>In October 2008, the University of Saskatchewan was named one of <a>Saskatchewan's Top Employers</a>, which was announced by the Saskatoon <a>StarPhoenix</a> and <a>Regina Leader-Post</a> newspapers.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors administrators comprise Chancellor W. Tom Molloy, <a>O.C.</a>, <a>Q.C.</a>, <a>B.A.</a>, <a>LL.B</a>, President and Vice-Chancellor Dr. R. Peter MacKinnon <a>Q.C.</a>, <a>B.A.</a>, <a>LL.B</a>, <a>LL.M.</a>, <a>LL.D.</a>; Vice-Presidents or Resource Officers: Dr. Michael Atkinson, Provost and Vice-President Academic; Richard Florizone, Vice-President (Finance &amp; Resources); Dr. Steven Franklin, Vice-President (Research); Heather Magotiaux, Vice-President (University Advancement).</pre>
<h3>University presidents</h3>
<p>The past 100 years have seen eight university presidents beginning with <a>Walter Charles Murray</a> (1908&ndash;37) who helped establish and set the groundwork for the University of Saskatchewan. In other words, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>to make a University where no University existed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a>James Sutherland Thomson</a> (1937&ndash;49) was the second president </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>during some of the most difficult years in the institution's history. His term spanned the final years of the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the hectic, early post-war years. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <a>Walter Palmer Thompson</a> persidency term (1949&ndash;59) spanned the university's 50th anniversary year. Dr. Walter Murray said to him </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Do not be appalled at the absence of all you have been accustomed to find in other Universities. We have all had to start with nothing.. .You have virgin soil to break.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In many fields Biologist Walter P. Thompson leadership brought innovation, insight and research to new areas beginning with rust resistant varieties of wheat which curtailed the 1916 catastrophic outbreak of rust. He also was instrumental in developing in Saskatchewan a comprehensive medicare program. His popularity and qualities of administrator and teacher served the U of S well during his presidency. The fourth and youngest Canadian university president, [[John William Tranter Spinks]] (1959&ndash;74) brought in a whirlwind era for the university. &lt;blockquote&gt;...enrolment sky rocketed, a new campus was opened, new buildings were erected, new colleges and schools were started and course offerings were increased. This included a comprehensive health care complex, establishment of a Crop Development Centre, a Linear Accelerator Laboratory, SED Systems, an Institute for Northern Studies, and an Indian and Northern Education Program.&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Robert William Begg]] (1974&ndash;80) became the fifth U of S president, who received the [[Order of Canada]] during his term in office &lt;blockquote&gt;for his distinguished career in education and for his contributions to cancer research. &lt;/blockquote&gt; The next president was [[Leo Friman Kristjanson]] (1980&ndash;89) who served a foreshortened term due to the onset of Parkinson's disease. However, even during this tenure from which he left early, the University saw the addition of the Innovation Place research park, Geology Building, Kinsmen Children's Centre, The Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, a new Saskatoon Cancer Clinic, expansion of health science facilities, the Rt. Hon. John G. Diefenbaker Centre, and the groundwork was laid for the new agriculture building. The sixth university president was [[J.W. George Ivany]] (1989&ndash;99). &lt;blockquote&gt; The J.W. George Ivany Internationalization Award, to be presented annually, was established in 1998 to acknowledge Dr. Ivany's &quot;commitment to internationalization and his leadership in fulfillment of that commitment&quot;. &lt;/blockquote&gt; The current president ushering forward the University of Saskatchewan's centennial year is [[R. Peter MacKinnon]] (1999&ndash; ).</pre>
<h3>University chancellors</h3>
<p>The University of Saskatchewan chancellor would have the duties to preside over convocation ceremonies whereupon they would confer degrees, they chair the Senate and become members of the Board of Governors.</pre>
<p>The first University of Saskatchewan chancellor was Justice <a>Edward Ludlow Wetmore</a> <a>B.A.</a> (1909&ndash;1917). The University of Saskatchewan Board of Governors honoured him with an honorary <a>D.C.L.</a>, in recognition of the contributions Edward Wetmore gave to </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>both (the province and country) [which] enjoy in rich measure the results of his great common sense, his judiciousness and his high sense of public duty in shaping those fundamental traditions which give character and direction to the activities of two of the most influential institutions of the State, the judiciary and the University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honourable Sir <a>Frederick W. A. G. Haultain</a> <a>K.B.</a>, the second chancellor served the university 1917&ndash;1940. Sir Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, was instrumental in the establishment of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the <a>North West Territories</a>, also Commissioner of Education, he also spent time and energy developing the early school system on the rugged frontier. Next, in line was Justice <a>P. E. MacKenzie</a> <a>B.A.</a> and <a>LL.B</a>. between 1940&ndash;1946. In the years 1946&#x2013;1947 <a>Donald Maclean</a> <a>BSc</a>, <a>LL.B</a> and was a valued contributor to the University of Saskatchewan, and was awarded an honorary bachelor of law as well as appointed fourth chancellor. <a>F. H. Auld</a> <a>LL.D.</a>, <a>OBE</a> became the University's fifth chancellor holding several three year terms between 1947&ndash;1965. Francis Hedley received great recognition as Deputy Minister of Agriculture in Saskatchewan for his improvements. [[E.M. Culliton]] [[Order of Canada|CC]], [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|S.O.M.]], [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]], [[Doctor of Civil Law|D.C.L.]], served the university as chancellor from 1965 to 1969.
