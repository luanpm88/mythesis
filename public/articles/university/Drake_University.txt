Today, Drake is one of the twenty-five oldest law schools in the country. Distinguished alumni include <a>Dwight D. Opperman</a>, former CEO of West Publishing Company, after whom Drake's law library was named; <a>Neal Smith</a>, who served in the <a>United States House of Representatives</a> from 1959 until 1995; and <a>Terry Edward Branstad</a>, a former four-term <a>Republican</a> <a>Governor of Iowa</a>, who served from 1983 until 1999.

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Francis Marion Drake</a> <a>thumb|Old Main</a> The institution was founded in 1881, when most of the staff of <a>Oskaloosa College</a> left that college to establish what would become Drake University, founded by <a>Francis Marion Drake</a>, a resident of <a>Centerville</a>, <a>Iowa</a> and <a>Governor of Iowa</a> (1896&#x2013;1898).  From its founding in 1881, Drake University maintained affiliation with the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a> although no religious affiliation is officially recognized today.</p>
<p>The university's <a>law school</a>, the oldest law school in the country west of the Mississippi River, was established in 1865 by Chester C. Cole [<a>http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/about/history/justices/CCCole.asp</a>], who served on the <a>Iowa Supreme Court</a> from 1864 to 1876. In 1969 Drake's basketball team went to the Final Four under coach Maurice John, but were defeated by the <a>UCLA</a> Bruins by three points. Drake did defeat the <a>North Carolina Tar Heels</a> by 20 points in the third place game. </p>
<p>On September 17, 1969 the Drake student newspaper, <em>The <a>Times-Delphic</a>[<a>http://www.timesdelphic.com</a>],</em> published what appears to be the first documented account of the famous <a>Paul is dead</a> hoax, written by Tim Harper. No articles published prior to this piece about the supposed death of <a>Paul McCartney</a> are known, although fellow <em>Times-Delphic</em> reporter and musician Dartanyan Brown, one of the sources for the article, recalled hearing about the hoax from other musicians and reading about it in some underground newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions of learning must come under this rule: By their fruits ye shall know them. A practical education is that which gives the mind the most power and adaptability. The credentials that your young and hopeful alma mater will soon confer upon each of you can only give you an introduction to the world of letters and of actual life. They can serve you no further. In whatever of the varied vocations of life you may engage, as well as in general society, you must work out your own destiny.&quot; - Drake Founder George Carpenter at Drake University's third commencement in 1884</p>

<h3>The Knapp Center</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The Knapp Center</a> The <a>Knapp Center</a> is a 7,002 seat multi-purpose arena at Drake. Its main purpose is to host Drake athletic events, but is also used for, among other things, concerts, Bucksbaum Lectures, and <a>commencement</a>. It was built in 1992, and is the home of the Drake Bulldogs. Prior to the Knapp Center, Drake's basketball teams played their games at <a>Veterans Memorial Auditorium</a> in downtown Des Moines.  Other sports previously used the fieldhouse which is about a block west of the Knapp Center.  The first Drake basketball game in the Knapp Center was played on December 5, 1992.</p>
<h3>Drake Relays</h3>
<p> Drake University also hosts the <a>Drake Relays</a> during April. This <a>track and field</a> event has been held since 1910, and is the second-largest collegiate track and field event in the United States. Participants come from all over the world to compete in this three-day event, which also helps to draw large crowds of spectators to Des Moines. Many Olympic athletes can be found participating in these events, which commonly break national and world records.  Des Moines police units are in heavy presence for the event, though most students claim many of the city's <a>laws</a> and <a>ordinances</a>, especially those regarding underage alcohol cosumption, are suspended for the event.  </p>
<p>Students kick-off the Relays in the annual tradition of <em>Street Painting</em>, in which student organizations colorfully decorate areas of Carpenter Avenue near the center of campus under a common theme. The theme in 2007 was &quot;The Legacy Lives On&quot;&#x2014;referencing the $15 million renovation of Drake Stadium.  Other themes have included 2009's &quot;Running Strong a Century Long&quot;, in honor of the 100th running of the Relays, and 2010's &quot;History to you, Tradition to us&quot;. <a>Streaking</a> the street painting was an annual occurrence for a period in the mid-1990s and has occasionally occurred in a few years following.</p>
<h3>Fight Song</h3>
<p>The fight song for Drake University is <em>The &quot;D&quot; Song</em>.  The lyrics are: </p>
<p>Here's to the one who wears the &quot;D&quot;,&lt;br&gt; Makes a good fight for varsity,&lt;br&gt; Here's to those who've fought and won,&lt;br&gt; Made a good fight as a true Drake alum,</p>
<p>Here's to the one who's brave and bold,&lt;br&gt; Ready to battle like days of old,&lt;br&gt; Fights like a Bulldog for victory,&lt;br&gt; Oh, here's to the one who wears the &quot;D&quot;.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p>Drake University advanced to seventh in the &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; rankings and gained sole possession of fourth place in the overall rankings of 142 Midwest Universities - Master's category published by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> magazine in the 2007 edition of &quot;America's Best Colleges.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year Drake ranked eighth in the &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; category. The rankings are based on a formula that relates a school's academic quality, as indicated by its <em>U.S. News</em> ranking, to the net cost of attendance for a student who receives the average level of need-based financial aid. &quot;The higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost, the better the deal,&quot; according to the magazine.</p>
<p>Drake continues to be ranked No. 2 in reputation for academic quality (peer assessment). It has the highest ranking in its category of any Iowa college or university. Drake improved in several areas this year, including student/faculty ratio, average freshmen retention rate and freshmen in the top 25 percent of their high school class.</p>
