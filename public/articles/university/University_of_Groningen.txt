It is <a>one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands</a> as well as one of its largest. Since its inception more than 100,000 students have graduated. It is a member of the <a>Coimbra Group</a>. </p>
<p>The University of Groningen has 9 faculties, 9 Graduate Schools, 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175 degree programmes. </p>
<h2>The Institution</h2>
<p>The <strong>University of Groningen</strong> () is organized in nine faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, Life Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Technology. Each faculty (<em>cf.</em>, College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and Exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|500px|Senaatszaal in the Academy Building</a> The founding of the University in 1614 &#x2013; at that time still a college of higher education &#x2013; was an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties &#x2013; Theology, Law, Medicine and Philosophy. The first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the University with about 100 students enrolling every year. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands &#x2013; the first Rector Magnificus, <a>Ubbo Emmius</a>, came from <a>East Frisia</a> in modern day <a>Germany</a>, for instance &#x2013; but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the University and the city and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>The development of the University came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by <a>&#x2018;Bommen Berend&#x2019;</a> in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the University at any one time during this period. <a>Petrus Camper</a>, though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient&#x2019;s clinic for surgical medicine. </p>
<p>Opportunities and threats followed on each other&#x2019;s heels during the nineteenth century. In 1815, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the University gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the University, which was renamed the &quot;Rijksuniversiteit Groningen&quot; (RUG). Teaching now took place in Dutch as well as in Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty. This laid the foundations for the present research university.</p>
<p>The University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the University celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 26,500 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.</p>
<h2>Arms</h2>
<p>The <a>coat of arms</a> of the university was confirmed by the <a>States</a> of the <a>City and County of Groningen</a> in <a>1615</a>. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls. </p>

<h3>Graduate Schools</h3>
<p>The University of Groningen&#x2019;s Graduate Schools are organized somewhat different from its international counterparts. The main difference is that the Graduate Schools do not contain all Master's programmes; Graduate Schools manage and facilitate the two-year Master's programmes: top Master's degree programmes and Research Master's degree programmes. </p>
