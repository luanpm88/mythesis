<p><strong>Los Angeles Pierce College</strong>, also known as <strong>Pierce College</strong>, <strong>Pierce</strong>, is a two-year <a>community college</a> that serves more than 23,000 students in the northern <a>Chalk Hills</a> of <a>Woodland Hills</a>, a community within the <a>San Fernando Valley</a> region of the <a>city of Los Angeles</a>, <a>California</a>.</p>
<p>The college began with 70 students and 18 faculty members on September 15, 1947. Originally known as the <em>Clarence W. Pierce School of Agriculture</em>, the institution&#x2019;s initial focus was <a>crop cultivation</a> and <a>animal husbandry</a>. Nine years later, in 1956, the school was renamed to <em>Los Angeles Pierce College</em>, retaining the name of its founder, Dr. Pierce, as well as his commitment to agricultural and veterinary study. (Pierce still maintains a  working farm for hands-on training.)</p>

<h2>Bond construction</h2>
<p>Since the approval of Los Angeles County Propositions A and AA, Pierce College has been undergoing large-scale renovation.</p>
<p>By 2010 two new &#x201c;green&#x201d; complexes now under construction&#x2014;a . Center for the Sciences and a . Student Services Building&#x2014;will add increased capacity and classrooms and laboratories with enhanced technologies. Other key improvements are increased parking, new infrastructure and roadways, and renovations to existing facilities.</p>
<p>The 2008 passage of Measure J for Jobs will bring further enhancements to the College, with a new Library/Learning Center/Instructional Media Center, and classroom facilities that offer programs focusing on emerging green technologies and new media in the planning stages.</p>
<p>The two-acre S. Mark Taper Foundation Life Science Botanic Garden, completed in 2007, is a &#x201c;living classroom&#x201d; in the middle of campus. It features one of the finest collections of drought-resistant plants in the region.</p>
<p>Pierce College prides itself as an environmentally-forward institution, with a 191-kilowatt <a>solar generation system</a> that has 1,274 <a>photovoltaic panels</a> and a 360-<a>kilowatt</a>, natural gas co-generation system. This project is the largest of its kind to be undertaken by a U.S. community college, yielding around 4.4 million <a>kilowatt-hours</a> of electricity a year and reducing <a>Carbon dioxide</a> emissions by more than 1,500 tons over its operating lifetime. The college also has a <a>water retention pond</a> beneath its soccer field, collecting run-off from the adjacent parking lot. The <a>Los Angeles River</a> is nearby to the north. Under propositions A and AA, a new <a>water reclamation</a> facility is also being planned, and the new facilities will meet rigorous Silver-level guidelines set by the <a>U.S. Green Building Council</a> for <a>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a>.</p>
<p>The campus is home to &quot;Old Trapper's Lodge,&quot; an <a>outsider art</a> environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator, John Ehn.</p>
