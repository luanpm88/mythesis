<p>&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSSION BEFORE CHANGING THE UNIVERSITY NAME TO PASHTO!!!!! --&gt;  The <strong>Kabul University</strong> (<strong>KU</strong>) is located in <a>Kabul</a>, capital of <a>Afghanistan</a>. It was founded in 1931 but officially opened for classes in 1932. Kabul University is currently attended by approximately 7,000 students, of which 1,700 are women. The university is still recovering from the long period of war and chaos in the country. The main building was rebuilt about 500 meters from the old one, which has almost the same design.</p>
<p>Kabul University consists of 14 faculties in fields of <a>Agriculture</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Pharmacy</a>, <a>Islamic Studies</a>, <a>Law</a>, Language and <a>Literature</a>, <a>Science</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Journalism</a>, <a>Veterinary medicine</a>, <a>Social Science</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Geoscience</a> and <a>Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>There is some debate on the name of the university. Officially, the university is known by the <a>Pashto</a> name <em>Da K&#x0101;bul Pohant&#x016b;n</em> (<strong>&#x062f;&#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644; &#x067e;&#x0648;&#x0647;&#x0646;&#x062a;&#x0648;&#x0646;</strong>). Recently, it has been suggested to use three different official names in Pashto, Persian (<strong>&#x062f;&#x0627;&#x0646;&#x0634;&#x06af;&#x0627;&#x0647; &#x06a9;&#x0627;&#x0628;&#x0644;</strong> - <em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e K&#x0101;bul</em>), and English (<em>University of Kabul</em>); most of all, because Persian-speaking students feel discriminated by the governmental ban of the Persian word for university. This lead to a clash between students and the police in November 2008, as mostly Persian-speaking students demanded to lift the ban on Persian words.</p>
<p>Previously, the <em>Minister of Culture, Information, Tourism and Youth Affairs</em>, <a>Karim Khoram</a>, had officially banned the use of Persian expressions in government institutions and in state-controlled media, As a result, that university's name was officially changed from Pashto (<em>Pohant&#x016b;n-e Balkh</em>) to Persian (<em>D&#x0101;neshg&#x0101;h-e Balkh</em>).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Biology class at Kabul University during the late 1950s or early 1960s.</a> Kabul University was established in 1931 during the reign of <a>Mohammed Nadir Shah</a> and then <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Mohammad Hashim Khan</a>, opening its doors one year later to students from across the country. Having benefited from partnerships with the governments of <a>France</a>, <a>Germany</a>, <a>Russia</a>, and the <a>United States</a> the university became one of the finest institutions of its kind in <a>Asia</a>, the intellectual heart of the country.</p>
<p>In the 1960s foreign-educated scholars populated the campus, exposing the new generation to new topics such as <a>communism</a>, <a>feminism</a> and <a>capitalism</a>. Students influenced during this era included <a>Ahmad Shah Massoud</a>, <a>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>, Dr. <a>Faiz Ahmad</a>, and <a>Saydal Sokhandan</a>.</p>
<p>Many different political groups were influenced in the University such as <a>Khaliqis</a>, <a>Parcham</a>is, Sholayees, Ikhwanies, and etc.</p>
<p>In a clash between Ikhwanies and Sholayees, a poet named Saydal Sokhandan was killed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the 1970s. Saydal was fired upon and shot by Gulbuddin during an argument.</p>
<p>During the governance of the <a>People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)</a>, Kabul University lost several lecturers and staff. The majority of the university's faculty left during the 10 year period of unrest or civil war that followed after the fall of the PDPA government in 1992.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding</h3>

In January 2004, the campus had only 24 computers and one <a>stethoscope</a>. As part of its recovery program, Kabul University has established partnerships with four foreign universities, including <a>Purdue University</a> and the <a>University of Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, Iran donated $800,000 to Kabul University's <a>dentistry</a> faculty. It also donated 25,000 books to the university. At present, the main library of Kabul University is the best-equipped library in Afghanistan. The library is equipped with many computers, books and magazines.</p>
<p>In July 2010, a newly constructed <em>Faculty of Arts</em> building was inaugurated. The $10 million project was funded by Pakistan.[<a>http://www.pajhwok.com/img2.asp?sz=600&amp;file=/cms/photos/img_201072816334.jpg</a>]</p>
