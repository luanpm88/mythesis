<p>The <strong>Kenya Methodist University (KeMU)</strong> is a Chartered private University founded by the <a>Methodist Church</a> in <a>Kenya</a>. It is situated within woodland on the North Eastern slopes of <a>Mount Kenya</a>, five kilometers from Meru Town. The evolution of KeMU is based on the 1906 <a>Methodist Church</a> education policy that resulted in the development of schools, industrial institutes and colleges.</p>
<h2>Brief History</h2>
<p>In 1987, the Methodist Church in Kenya (MCK) formed a Working Committee to work out modalities of establishing a University in this region. In 1995 the Commission for Higher Education made an inspection visit of the project, and later in June 1997 granted a Letter of Interim Authority, giving approval for the establishment of Kenya Methodist University. This authority paved the way for the creation of academic programmes, research and post-graduate training. KeMU became a fully <strong>Chartered University in June 2006</strong>.&#x00a0;The University maintains an ecumenical character. From the first batch of 9 students in 1997, the population has grown tremendously to over 8,000 currently. The university has satellite campuses in Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa and Nyeri.</p>
<h2>Philosophy of KeMU</h2>
<p>The University&#x2019;s philosophy is to foster the intellectual, spiritual and physical development of the wholesome individual in order to recognize and utilize the available opportunities for enhancement of human development with the appropriate recognition and respect for other creations.
