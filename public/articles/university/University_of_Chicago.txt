<h2>History</h2>
<p>  [[File:Uchicago convocation 1894.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|An early [[convocation]] ceremony at the University of Chicago]]</p>
<h3>Founding&#x2013;1910s</h3>
<p>The University of Chicago was created and <a>incorporated</a> as a <a>coeducational</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; secular institution in 1890 by the <a>American Baptist Education Society</a> and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>. It emerged from a <a>Baptist university of the same name</a> that had closed in 1886 due to financial difficulties. <a>William Rainey Harper</a> became the modern University's first president on July 1, 1891, and the first classes were held on October 1, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>business school</a> was founded in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>law school</a> was founded in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harper died in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by a series of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the <a>Oriental Institute</a> was founded.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>1920s&#x2013;1980s</h3>
<p>In 1929, the University's fifth president, <a>Robert Maynard Hutchins</a>, took office; the University underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the University in an attempt to deemphasize athletics over academics,&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the <a>Common Core</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;core&quot; /&gt; and organized the University's graduate work into its current four divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and <a>Northwestern University</a> into a single university.&lt;ref name=&quot;merger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students,&lt;ref name=&quot;hospitalhistory&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>Committee on Social Thought</a> was created.</p>
<p>[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|left|thumb|350px|The University of Chicago team that worked on the production of the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction, including [[Enrico Fermi]] in the front row|alt=A group of people in suits standing in three rows on the steps in front of a stone building.]] Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> helped the school to survive through the <a>Great Depression</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; During <a>World War II</a>, the University made important contributions to the <a>Manhattan Project</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;manhattan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The University was the site of the first isolation of <a>plutonium</a> and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by <a>Enrico Fermi</a> in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;manhattan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the University became a major sponsor of a controversial <a>urban renewal</a> project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. For details of this urban renewal effort, see <a>Hyde Park</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, John W. &quot;The Kind of University That We Desire to Become&quot;, Annual Report to the Faculty of the College (October 28, 2008). Excerpt available online at: <a>http://www.uchicago.edu/pdfs/boyer_report.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The University experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the University's off-campus rental policies. In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, <a>Marlene Dixon</a>, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1978, <a>Hanna Holborn Gray</a>, then the provost and acting president of <a>Yale University</a>, became President of the University of Chicago, in which capacity she served for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>1990s&#x2013;2000s</h3>
<p>In 1999, then-President <a>Hugo Sonnenschein</a> announced plans to relax the University's famed <a>core curriculum</a>, reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>The Economist</a></em>, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the University became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;corewar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In the past decade, the University began a number of multi-million dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the <a>Milton Friedman Institute</a>. The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the <a>Chicago Theological Seminary</a>. Some faculty members and students have signed petition against these plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;petition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, investor <a>David G. Booth</a> donated $300&nbsp;million to the University's <a>Graduate School of Business</a>, which is the largest gift in the University's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.&lt;ref name=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A recent two billion dollar campaign has brought substantial expansion to the campus, including the unveiling of the <a>Max Palevsky Residential Commons</a>, the South Campus Residence Hall, the <a>Gerald Ratner Athletics Center</a>, a new hospital, and a new science building. Current construction projects include: the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, as well as further additions to the medical campus of the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;knapp&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>[[Image:Mitchell-Magdalen comparison.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The older buildings of the University of Chicago employ [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture like that of the <a>University of Oxford</a>. For example, Chicago's Mitchell Tower (left) was modeled after Oxford's <a>Magdalen Tower</a> (right).]]</p>
<p>The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of  in the Chicago neighborhoods of <a>Hyde Park</a> and <a>Woodlawn</a>, seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of <a>downtown Chicago</a>. The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the <a>Midway Plaisance</a>, a large, linear park created for the 1893 <a>World's Columbian Exposition</a>.</p>
<p>The first buildings of the University of Chicago campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a &quot;master plan&quot; conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect <a>Henry Ives Cobb</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot; /&gt; The Main Quadrangles consist of six <a>quadrangles</a>, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, <a>Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge</a>, <a>Holabird &amp; Roche</a>, and other architectural firms in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style, deliberately patterned after the layouts of the <a>Universities of Oxford</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's <a>Magdalen Tower</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the University Commons, <a>Hutchinson Hall</a>, is a duplicate of Oxford's <a>Christ Church</a> Hall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)</p>
<p>After the 1940s, the Collegiate Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot; /&gt; In 1955, <a>Eero Saarinen</a> was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen);&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; a series of arts buildings;&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; a building designed by <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> for the University's School of Social Service Administration;&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; and the <a>Regenstein Library</a>, the largest building on campus, a <a>brutalist</a> structure designed by <a>Walter Netsch</a> of the Chicago firm <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;twentytwenty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; produced the <a>Gerald Ratner Athletics Center</a> (2003),&lt;ref name=&quot;twentytwenty&quot;/&gt; the <a>Max Palevsky Residential Commons</a> (2001),&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; <a>South Campus Residence Hall</a> and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital,&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and other constructions, expansions, and restorations.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0878/features/on_the_map.shtml</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The site of <a>Chicago Pile-1</a> is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and is marked by the <a>Henry Moore</a> sculpture <em><a>Nuclear Energy</a></em>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Robie House</a>, a <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a> building acquired by the University in 1963, is also a National Historic Landmark,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; as is room 405 of the <a>George Herbert Jones Laboratory</a>, where <a>Glenn T.

<h3>Satellite campuses</h3>
<p>The University of Chicago also maintains facilities apart from its main campus. The University's <a>Booth School of Business</a> maintains campuses in <a>Singapore</a>, <a>London</a>, and the downtown <a>Streeterville</a> neighborhood of Chicago. The Center in Paris, a campus located on the <a>left bank</a> of the <a>Seine</a> in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Chicago also opened a new center in Beijing in fall 2010.</p>
<h2>Administration and finances</h2>
<p>The University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees. The Board of Trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the University and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 50 members including the University President.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Directly beneath the President are the Provost, fourteen Vice Presidents (including the <a>Chief Financial Officer</a>, <a>Chief Investment Officer</a>, and Dean of Students of the University), the Directors of <a>Argonne National Laboratory</a> and <a>Fermilab</a>, the Secretary of the University, and the Student <a>Ombudsperson</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;orgchart&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2009, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees is <a>Andrew Alper</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the President of the University is <a>Robert Zimmer</a>.</p>
<p>The University's endowment was the 11th largest among American educational institutions and state university systems in 2008&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as of July 2010 is valued at $5.578 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment1&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>The academic bodies of the University of Chicago consist of the <a>College</a>, four divisions of graduate research, six professional schools, and the Graham School of General Studies (a <a>continuing education</a> school). The University also contains a library system, the <a>University of Chicago Press</a>, the <a>University of Chicago Laboratory Schools</a>, and the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>, and holds ties with a number of independent academic institutions, including <a>Fermilab</a> and <a>Argonne National Laboratory</a>. The University is accredited by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegenavigator&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The University runs on a <a>quarter system</a> in which the academic year is divided into four terms: Summer (June&#x2013;August), Autumn (September&#x2013;December), Winter (January&#x2013;March), and Spring (April&#x2013;June).&lt;ref name=&quot;calendar&quot;/&gt; Full-time undergraduate students take three to four courses every quarter&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; for approximately eleven weeks before their quarterly academic breaks. The school year typically begins in late September and ends in mid-June.&lt;ref name=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Undergraduate college</h3>
<p> The College of the University of Chicago grants <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees in 49 <a>academic major</a>s and 22 minors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The college's academics are divided into five divisions: the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division, the Social Sciences Collegiate Division, the Humanities Collegiate Division, and the New Collegiate Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegiatedivisions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first four are sections within their corresponding graduate divisions, while the New Collegiate Division administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit in one of the other four divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Undergraduate students are required to take a distribution of courses to satisfy the University's <a>core curriculum</a> known as the <a>Common Core</a>. Most of the Core classes at Chicago contain no more than 25&nbsp;students, and are generally led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a <a>teaching assistant</a>).&lt;ref name=&quot;curriculum2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2009&#x2013;2010 school year, 15&nbsp;courses, tested proficiency in a foreign language, passage of a swim test, and up to three physical education courses (depending on results of an entrance examination) are required under the Core.&lt;ref name=&quot;core&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>In fiscal year 2006, the University of Chicago spent US$305,301,000 on scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsfresearch&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> as an institution with &quot;very high research activity&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a founding member of the <a>Committee on Institutional Cooperation</a> and the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.</p>
<p>The University operates 12 research institutes and 113 research centers on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are the <a>Oriental Institute</a>&#x2014;a museum and research center for <a>Near East</a>ern studies owned and operated by the University&#x2014;and a number of <a>National Resource Center</a>s, including the <a>Center for Middle Eastern Studies</a>. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with a number of research institutions apart from the university proper. The University partially manages <a>Argonne National Laboratory</a>, part of the <a>United States Department of Energy</a>'s national laboratory system, and has a joint stake in <a>Fermilab</a>, a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the <a>Apache Point Observatory</a> in <a>Sunspot, New Mexico</a>. Faculty and students at the adjacent <a>Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a> collaborate with the University,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and although formally unrelated, the <a>National Opinion Research Center</a> is located on campus.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago has been the site of some important experiments and academic movements. In economics, the University has played an important role in shaping ideas about the <a>free market</a>&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Sherryl (2002) <em>The Revival of Laissez-Faire in American Macroeconomic Theory: A Case Study of Its Pioneers</em>. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing. ISBN 1-84064-606-3&lt;/ref&gt; and is the namesake of the <a>Chicago school of economics</a>, the school of economic thought supported by <a>Milton Friedman</a> and other economists. The University's <a>sociology</a> department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the <a>Chicago school of sociology</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In physics, the University was the site of the <a>Chicago Pile-1</a> (the first self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction, part of the <a>Manhattan Project</a>), of <a>Robert Millikan</a>'s <a>oil-drop experiment</a> that calculated the charge of the electron,&lt;ref name=&quot;oildrop&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and of the development of <a>radiocarbon dating</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p> There have been 85&nbsp;Nobel Laureates affiliated with the University of Chicago,&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt; 17 of whom were pursuing research or on faculty at the University at the time of the award announcement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In addition, many Chicago alumni and scholars have won the <a>Fulbright awards</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 44 have matriculated as <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>The University of Chicago hosts 19 varsity sports teams: 10 men's teams and 9 women's teams,&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsfacts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; all called the <a>Maroons</a>, with 585 students participating in the 2008&#x2013;2009 school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsfacts&quot; /&gt;</p>
