<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of St Andrews</strong>, informally referred to as <strong>St Andrews</strong>, was founded between 1410 and 1413, and is the <a>oldest</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Scotland</a> and the third oldest in the <a>English-speaking world</a> after <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>. The University is situated in the town of <a>St Andrews</a>, in <a>Fife</a>, on the east coast of Scotland.  It was founded between 1410 and 1413, when a Papal Bull was issued by the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII.  In post-nominals the University of St Andrews was historically abbreviated as St And (from the Latin Sancti Andreae).</p>
<p>Academically, St Andrews is considered one of the United Kingdom's best universities.  Over the past five years, domestic league tables have tended to place it amongst the top five institutions in the nation and the Times Higher Education (THE) currently show St Andrews as one of the top 20 Arts and Humanities universities in the world.  Overall, the THE places St Andrews 103&#x2014;just behind the American Ivy League&#x2019;s Dartmouth College.  St Andrews has an extremely diverse student body due to a high intake of internationals.  Throughout its history St Andrews has maintained strong links with academic institutions in the United States.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University was founded in 1410 when a <a>charter</a> of incorporation was bestowed upon the <a>Augustinian</a> <a>priory</a> of <a>St Andrews Cathedral</a>. A <a>Papal Bull</a> was issued in 1413 by the <a>Avignon Pope Benedict XIII</a>. A royal charter was granted in 1532. The University grew in size quite rapidly; A <a>pedagogy</a>, <a>St John's College</a> was founded 1418-1430 by Robert of Montrose and Lawrence of Lindores, <a>St Salvator's College</a> was established in 1450, <a>St Leonard's College</a> in 1511, and <a>St Mary's College</a> in 1537. St Mary's College was a re-foundation of St Johns College and earlier pedagogy. Some of the early college buildings that are in use today date from this period such as <a>St Salvator's Chapel</a> and St Leonards College chapel and St Mary's College quadrangle. At this time, much of the teaching was of a <a>religious</a> nature and was conducted by <a>cleric</a>s associated with the <a>cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>From the 17th to 19th centuries, St. Andrews underwent a dramatic decline which at some point even menaced the university's own survival. Pupil numbers were very low; for instance, when <a>Samuel Johnson</a> visited the university in 1773, the university barely had 100 pupils, and this situation did not improve during the 19th century, as in the 1870s, the student population was fewer than 150. Apart from a low number of pupils, it was also unusual for them to graduate: especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, students would attend college for a term or two. This was due to relative irrelevance of academic degrees for educated people at that time, as they did not secure any social position for those coming from upper classes, and those coming from more humble origins could not commonly afford a college education if they did not hold a scholarship. The poverty of <a>Scotland</a> also damaged St. Andrews, as few were able to patronize the university and its colleges -state support being improbable- , and the income these ones got was scarce. Hence Samuel Johnson's depiction of St. Andrews as a place of quiet decadence.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The independent IpsosMORI <a>National Student Survey</a>s in 2006-2008 commissioned by <a>HEFCE</a> placed it joint third among the UK universities. In the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> 2001 the University did not received a rating lower than 4 on a grading scale 1-5*, where 5* denotes outstanding international research. The departments of English and Psychology have received a 5*, and 72% of staff across the university received a 5 or 5* rating. Furthermore, The <a>Philosophical Gourmet</a> report ranked St Andrews' joint graduate programme in philosophy with <a>Stirling University</a> second in the UK in 2009.</p>
<p>The latest national <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE 2008) sponsored by the UK government, <em><a>The Times</a></em>, <em><a>The Guardian</a></em> and <em><a>The Independent</a></em> ranked St Andrews as 16th by grade point average and quality index across the units of assessment it submitted.</p>
<p>Nearly 86% of its graduates obtain a First Class or an Upper Second Class Honours degree. The ancient Scottish universities award <a>Master of Arts</a> degrees (except for science students who are awarded a Bachelor of Science degree) which are classified upon graduation, in contrast to <a>Oxbridge</a> where one becomes a Master of Arts after a certain number of years, and the rest of the UK, where graduates are awarded BAs. These can be awarded with honours (and the majority of students do graduate with honours) which again, distinguishes them from the Oxbridge MA, which is not awarded with. honours The latest UCAS figures show that there are generally 10 applications per undergraduate place available, and the University has not entered Clearing since 2003. The standard offer of a place tends to require five best Highers equivalent to AAABB, or three best A-levels equivalent to AAB,</p>
<p>The university has a widening participation policy; however, the university has one of the smallest percentages of students (13%) from lower income backgrounds, out of all higher education institutions in the UK. Intake from <a>Independent schools</a> in England is high (around 40%). At the same time, the average price for accommodation for students at St Andrews is more than that for students at any other university in Scotland.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>Sponsio Academica</h3>
<p>In order to become a student at the university one must take an oath in <a>Latin</a> at the point of <a>matriculation</a>, called the Sponsio Academica:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We students who set down our names hereunder in all good faith make a solemn promise that we shall show due deference to our teachers in all matters relating to order and good conduct, that we shall be subject to the authority of the <a>Senatus Academicus</a> and shall, whatever be the position we attain hereafter, promote, so far as lies in our power, the profit and the interest in our University of St Andrews. Further, we recognise that, if any of us conducts ourselves in an unbecoming or disorderly manner or shows insufficient diligence in their studies and, though admonished, does not improve, it is within the power of the Senatus Academicus to inflict on such students a fitting penalty or even expel them from the University.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Gowns</h3>
<p> One of the most conspicuous traditions at St Andrews is the wearing of academic dress, particularly the distinctive red undergraduate gown of the United College. Undergraduates in Arts and Science subjects can be seen wearing these garments at the installation of a Rector or Chancellor, at chapel services, on 'Pier Walks', at formal hall dinners, at meetings of the <a>Union Debating Society</a>, or giving tours to prospective students and visitors as well as on St Andrews day, where recently many students wear their gown throughout the entire day. Divinity students wear a black undergraduate gown. (See <a>Academic dress of the University of St Andrews</a>.)  It is considered bad luck to wear the gown when one is not a matriculated student, such an event is said to result in a similar curse as stepping on the Patrick Hamilton cobbles, the only cure for which is the May Dip.</p>
<h3>Chapels</h3>
<p>The University owns two college chapels, St Salvator's and St Leonard's, both have their own choirs.  The Chapel of St Leonard's is considerably older whilst St Salvator's (or 'Sallies' as it is affectionately known) has a full peel of bells, the only university chapel in Scotland to have this feature.</p>
<h3>Raisin Weekend</h3>
<p><a>Raisin Weekend</a> is the highlight of the social calendar at the University. Held annually over the last weekend of November, first years are entertained by their <a>academic parents</a>, normally consisting of a tea party thrown by the mothers and then a tour of pubs or house party conducted by the fathers. This culminates in a shaving foam fight on the Monday morning in quad of <a>St Salvator</a>'s College. <a>right|thumb|200px|The &quot;cursed&quot; cobblestone initials outside St Salvators College chapel.</a></p>
<h3>Cobblestones</h3>
<p>Situated around the town of <a>St Andrews</a> are cobblestone markings denoting where Protestant martyrs were burnt at the stake. To students, the most notable of these is the cobblestone initials &quot;PH&quot; located outside the main gate of St Salvator's College. These cobblestones denote where <a>Patrick Hamilton</a> was martyred in 1528. According to student tradition, stepping on the &quot;PH&quot; will cause a student to become cursed, with the effect that the offender will fail his or her degree and so students are known to jump over the cobblestones when passing.  Aside from the May Dip, an older tradition is that the remedy for this is to walk three times round the post at the end of the pier.  Other, less superstitious, students pointedly <em>do</em> step on it to prove the tradition incorrect. It is not uncommon for graduates to deliberately step on the cobbles immediately after receiving their degree, as a celebration of having escaped the curse during their undergraduate study.</p>
<h3>May Dip</h3>
<p>The May Dip is a student tradition held annually at dawn on May Day. Students stay awake until dawn, at which time they collectively run into the North Sea to the sound of <a>madrigals</a> sung by the University Madrigal Group. The May Dip is also traditionally the only way of removing the curse inflicted by stepping on the PH cobbles. If a student is to step on the stones he/she can be forgiven if on the dawn of the first of May, they run into the North Sea.</p>
<h3>Kate Kennedy procession</h3>
<p>The annual Kate Kennedy procession is the Kate Kennedy Club's main event. Club members dress up in Period outfits and ride down Market street in horse-drawn carriages.</p>
<h2>Governance and administration</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The &quot;Gateway&quot; building, built in 2000 and now used for the University's Management department</a> </p>
<p>As with the other <a>Ancient universities</a> of Scotland, governance is determined by the <a>Universities (Scotland) Act 1858</a>. This Act created three bodies: the <a>General Council</a>, <a>University Court</a> and <a>Academic Senate</a> (<em>Senatus Academicus</em>).</p>
<h3>General Council</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the <a>graduates</a>, <a>academics</a> and former academics of the University. It meets twice a year and appoints a <a>Business Committee</a> to transact business between these meetings. Its most important functions are to appoint two <a>Assessor</a>s to the <a>University Court</a> and elect the University <a>Chancellor</a>.</p>
<h3>University Court</h3>
<p>The <a>University Court</a> is the body responsible for administrative and financial matters, and is in effect the governing body of the University. It is chaired by the <a>Rector</a>, who is elected by all the <a>matriculated</a> students of the University. Members are appointed by the General Council, <a>Academic Senate</a> and <a>Fife Council</a>. The President of the <a>Students' Representative Council</a> and Director of Representation are <em>ex officio</em> members of the Court. Several <a>lay</a> members are also co-opted and must include a fixed number of alumni of the University.</p>
<h3>Senatus Academicus</h3>
<p>The <a>Academic Senate</a> (Latin <em>Senatus Academicus</em>) is the supreme academic body for the University. Its members include all of the <a>Professor</a>s of the University, certain senior <a>Readers</a>, a number of <a>Senior Lecturer</a>s and <a>Lecturer</a>s and three elected student Senate Representatives - one from the Arts / Divinity faculty, one from the Science / Medicine faculty and one postgraduate student. It is responsible for authorising degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates. Another function of the Senate is to discipline students. The <a>President</a> of the Senate is the <a>University Principal</a>.</p>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The University of St Andrews Classics Building, Swallowgate</a> The University is divided into four academic <a>Faculties</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Arts</a></li>
  <li><a>Divinity</a></li>
  <li><a>Medicine</a></li>
  <li><a>Science</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each is governed by a Faculty Council and administered by a <a>Dean</a>. Students apply to become members of a particular faculty, as opposed to any particular school or department.</p>

<h3>Departments</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|180px|Department of Social Anthropology at St Andrews</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>School of Psychology</a>: Psychology at St Andrews has a long and distinguished history. Psychology had been taught at St Andrews since the late 1800s within the School of Philosophy, Logic, and Metaphysics, but when Psychology was moved to Dundee (which was then part of the University) it formed a separate department led by Alfred Flook. After the ceding of the <a>University of Dundee</a> from St Andrews in 1967, Psychology was re-established two years later with Professor <a>Malcolm Jeeves</a> taking the Foundation Chair of Psychology in 1969. Significant expansion and success of the department and its research saw it move to its current home in the Old Library in St Mary's College in 1979 where it became the School of Psychology. Ever since then the School has continued to succeed and lead in Scottish and British Psychology, coming in the top category for each Research Assessment Exercise carried out (an achievement only held by St Andrews and three other UK departments of Psychology: the <a>University of Cambridge</a>, the <a>University of Oxford</a>, and the <a>University of York</a>). The latest RAE in 2008 saw the School of Psychology at St Andrews come 1st in Scotland for its research, and 7th overall in the United Kingdom. Latest rankings from the Guardian University Guide 2011 also see Psychology at St Andrews standing as the 3rd best department in the UK. The School's main research interests centre around: Social Psychology, Perception, Origins of Mind, Human Cognition, Behavioural Neuroscience, and Applied, Clinical &amp; Health Psychology. The Head of School is currently <a>Professor Malcolm MacLeod</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Department of Social Anthropology</a>: The Anthropology Department at the University of St Andrews is noted for its research work, with recognition given to the department by research councils such as the <a>Scottish Funding Council</a> (SFC) in the last years and the department has achieved high standings in the latest <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE).</li>
  <li>The <a>School of Chemistry</a> was founded in 1811 and has undergone rapid development and improvement over the past decade. In the 2008 RAE Chemistry was ranked 4th for quality in the UK and as a consequence of its joint submission with Edinburgh chemistry it was ranked 1st in the 'power rating'.  Currently The School of Chemistry has 35 academic staff, over 120 PhD students, and 80 postdoctoral research workers with outstanding research in synthesis (e.g. selenium chemistry, <a>Woollins reagent</a> carbenes, fluorocarbons) energy storage and conversion (fuel cells and lightweight batteries) X-ray crystallography (e.g. robotic chemical crystallography), biological chemistry and surface science.  The current Head of School is Derek Woollins.</li>
  <li>The Department of Earth Sciences continues a tradition of teaching and research in <a>Geology</a> dating from 1903. The Department&#x2019;s research focuses on fundamental questions about Earth System behaviour from the present through to Deep Time, and the application of such knowledge to benefit societies and create sustainable economies. In the 2010 league tables of UK Geology/Earth Science courses the University of St Andrews was ranked 2nd (Independent), 3rd (The Times) and 4th (Guardian) and currently enjoys the best record nationally for graduate employability. The Head of Department is Professor Peter Cawood.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Office of the Principal</h3>
<p>The <a>Principal</a> is the <a>chief executive</a> of the University and is assisted in that role by several key officers.</p>
<p>The current composition of the Office of the Principal is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Principal and Vice-Chancellor: Professor <a>Louise Richardson</a></li>
  <li>Deputy Principal and Vice-Principal (Research): Professor Christopher Hawkesworth FRS</li>
  <li><a>Master of the United College</a>: Professor Neville Richardson</li>
  <li>Vice-Principal (Governance and Planning): Professor Ronald Piper</li>
  <li>Vice-Principal (Learning and Teaching): Professor Pat Willmer</li>
  <li>Vice-Principal (External Relations): Mr Stephen Magee</li>
  <li>Proctor and Provost of St Leonard's College: Professor Peter Clark</li>
  <li><a>Quaestor</a> and <a>Factor</a>: Derek Watson</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deans of the Faculties</h3>
<p>The Deans are academics appointed by the Master of the United College to oversee the day to day runnings of each faculty. They were once elected by their constituents but this was changed to appointment in 2005</p>
<p>The current Deans are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dean of the Faculty of Arts: Professor Roy Dilley</li>
  <li>Dean of the Faculty of Divinity: Professor James Davila</li>
  <li>Dean of the Faculty of Medicine: Professor R. Hugh MacDougall</li>
  <li>Dean of the Faculty of Science: Professor Alyson Tobin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student Residence Halls</h3>
<p>St Andrews is characterised amongst Scottish Universities as having a significant number of students in University operated accommodation. Approximately half of the overall student population live 'in Hall'. All are now co-educational and non-smoking. Residences include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Albany Park</a></li>
  <li><a>Andrew Melville Hall</a></li>
  <li><a>David Russell Apartments</a> (built on the site of the now-demolished original <em><a>David Russell Hall</a></em>)</li>
  <li><a>Deans Court</a> (Postgraduate only)</li>
  <li>Fife Park</li>
  <li>New Fife Park Apartments</li>
  <li>Gannochy House (Postgraduate only)</li>
  <li>John Burnet Hall (known as Atholl, and was male only)</li>
  <li>McIntosh Hall (known as Chattan, and was female only)</li>
  <li><a>New Hall</a></li>
  <li>St Regulus Hall (originally male only)</li>
  <li><a>St Salvator's Hall</a> (originally male only)</li>
  <li>Stanley Smith House &amp; Angus House (Postgraduate only)</li>
  <li>University Hall (originally female only)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Former residences</h3>
<p>In addition to the residences listed above, the University formerly also had the following residences:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Hamilton Hall</a></li>
  <li>Hepburn Hall - (although Hepburn remains a university residence under lease)</li>
  <li>Southgait Hall - (Largely rebuilt in the 1990s and still let to students albeit privately)</li>
  <li>Kinnessburn Hall</li>
  <li><a>David Russell Hall</a></li>
  <li>Bishops Hall (now part of St Leonards School)</li>
</ul>
<p>and West Park, which was pulled down to make way for the Students' Union building, built in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The University guarantees every first year student a place of accommodation. For this reason, when 400 extra students joined for the 2008/09 academic year, the university had to rent out flats in the previously sold Hepburn Hall to accommodate the rise in student numbers.</p>

<h2>Famous Rectors</h2>
<p><a>thumb|1922, Field Marshal Haig (centre), Chancellor of the University, with author J. M. Barrie new Rector of the university</a> In Scotland, the position of Rector exists in the four ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) - as well as in the University of Dundee. The post (officially Lord Rector, but by normal use Rector alone) was made an integral part of these universities by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The <a>Rector of the University of St Andrews</a> chairs meetings of the University Court, the governing body of the university, and is elected at regular intervals by the matriculated student body</p>

<h2>Links with the United States</h2>
<p>The University has a strong link with the United States. Significant numbers of students matriculate from the United States. Many important American figures (and emigrants to the United States) from Scotland have been associated with the university:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Andrew Carnegie</a>, Lord Rector of the University. See the following link to the NY Times article which documents his controversial Inaugural Address: <a>LORD RECTOR CARNEGIE</a>.</li>
  <li><a>Bill Bryson</a>, author.</li>
  <li><a>Bobby Jones</a>, golfer.</li>
  <li><a>Guy Sands-Pingot</a>, Brigadier General, USAR.</li>
  <li><a>Bob Dylan</a>, awarded honorary degree.</li>
  <li><a>Michael Douglas</a>, awarded honorary degree.</li>
  <li><a>Jonathan Taylor Thomas</a>, actor, exchange student.</li>
  <li><a>Arnold Palmer</a> honorary Doctor of Laws</li>
  <li><a>Jack Nicklaus</a> honorary Doctor of Laws</li>
  <li><a>Tom Watson</a> honorary Doctor of Laws</li>
</ul>
<h3>Signatories of the Declaration of Independence</h3>
<p>Also, three of the signatories of the 1776 <a>American Declaration of Independence</a> attended or received degrees from St Andrews, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>James Wilson</a>, born at Carskerdo, near <a>Cupar</a> (signer from the state of Pennsylvania)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilson attended three Scottish Universities including St Andrews, but did not earn a degree from any of them. Carrying important letters of introduction, Wilson arrived in the US in 1765. He became a Latin tutor at Philadelphia College (now the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>), and successfully petitioned that institution to grant him an honorary Master of Arts.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>John Witherspoon</a>, born at <a>Gifford, East Lothian</a> (signer from the state of New Jersey)</li>
</ul>
<p>Witherspoon had an impressive list of credentials and was a significant public figure. He was president of the College of New Jersey (now <a>Princeton University</a>). Witherspoon was largely responsible for converting the institution into a success by employing Scottish educational standards. He received his <a>Master of Arts</a>, <a>Bachelor of Divinity</a>, and was made a <a>Doctor of Divinity</a> at the University of St Andrews.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Benjamin Franklin</a>, born Boston, Massachusetts (signer from the state of Pennsylvania)</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1759 Franklin received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of St Andrews.</p>
<h3>Exchange Programmes</h3>
<p><a>The College of William &amp; Mary</a> sends several students each year to study in Scotland, while in return several St. Andrews students frequently participate in the reverse exchange program. As of Fall 2010, incoming freshmen at William &amp; Mary will be given the option of a four-year, joint degree program, spending their first year in Williamsburg, the second in St. Andrews, and the two final years as they decided. St. Andrews students will be offered the same program, with their first year at their home institution. <a>Emory University</a> in Atlanta runs an exchange programme with St Andrews called the <a>Bobby Jones Scholars</a> programme, which allows for recent graduates of both universities to study at the other university. In addition, the School of Physics and Astronomy maintains a postgraduate exchange with The <a>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. Both of these exchanges are funded by the Robert T. Jones Memorial Trust. The Robert Lincoln McNeil Scholarship is run in conjunction with the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>. One of the largest exchanges is with the <a>University of California</a>, and students are routinely sent to <a>Berkeley</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, and <a>UCSD</a>. The School of International Relations and the School of Modern Languages also oversee an undergraduate student exchange with <a>Sciences Po</a> in Paris. <a>Queen's University</a> and the <a>University of Western Ontario</a> in Canada provide a reciprocal exchange with St Andrews through the Robert Tyre Jones Jr. Scholarships  program.</p>
<h3>University of St Andrews</h3>
<p>Any alumnus, student or staff member can wear a scarf of dark blue, sky blue and white:  University of St Andrews&lt;br&gt;  <a>St Mary's College</a>&lt;br&gt;  <a>Bute Medical School</a>&lt;br&gt;  <a>St Leonard's College (Postgraduate)</a></p>
<h2>Student organisations</h2>
<p>[[Image:St Salvators chapel and north street -St Andrews.jpg|thumb|[[St Salvator's Chapel]] viewed from North Street.]]</p>
<h3>Students' Association</h3>
<p>The <a>University of St Andrews Students' Association</a> is the organisation which represents the <a>student body</a> of the University of St Andrews. The Association was instituted in 1983 under the Constitution and Laws of the University of St Andrews Students&#x2019; Association. It comprises the <a>Students' Representative Council</a> (SRC), established in 1885 and legally defined under the <a>Universities (Scotland) Act 1889</a>, and the Students' Union (which was itself a merger of the Students' Union and the Women's Union). The Students' Association is registered with the <a>Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator</a> as charity SCO19883</p>
<p>The Students' Association Building (colloquially known as <em>the Union</em>) is located on St Mary's Place, <a>St Andrews</a>. External bodies operating in the building include a <a>Blackwells</a> bookshop and the University's Student Support Services. The Students' Association is affiliated to, and indeed a founding member of, the <a>Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland</a> (CHESS) and is <em>not</em> a member of the <a>National Union of Students</a>.</p>
<h3>Societies</h3>
<p>Students at the university form various voluntary societies for <a>academic</a>, social, artistic, political, religious and other purposes. Many of these are affiliated with the Students' Association, such as the <a>University of St Andrews Union Debating Society</a> and the Just So Society which recently put on the controversial musical 'Jerry Springer: The Opera' which attracted both protesters and national press attention. Among the most recently affiliated societies there is The Sandclock Society. Other groups are not affiliated to the University or the Students Association, and therefore not a part of the University structure. Notable <a>independent student groups</a> include the Global Investment Group, the <a>International Politics Association</a>, The Conservative &amp; Unionist Association, The Psychology Society, The Philosophy Society, <a>Left Society</a> and The Regulus.</p>
<p>The university's Music Society comprises many student-run musical groups, including the University's flagship orchestra; the  symphony orchestra, wind band, and chorus. They also organise their own series of weekly lunchtime recitals. The Society was noted for particular strength in the University in the Sunday Times Universities Guide 2011. The music society is organising a major composition competition in the candlemas term of 2011 &#x2013; details can be found at <a>http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mussoc/600</a>.  Another notable music society is the University Madrigal Group, widely reputed to be the best choir in St Andrews</p>
<p>Students and Staff from the University of St Andrews are developing the unique <a>Project Zambia</a>. Piloted in 2009, the project is now embedded in the work of the Department of Sport and Exercise and the Student Experience Office in the University of St Andrews. Students are recruited from two sections of the University's student body: top performance athletes are chosen for their commitment to sport, while students who have shown commitment to pastoral volunteering, aiding their fellow students, are chosen to extend their experience in the caring professions.The students, and staff seeking professional development, travel to <a>Zambia</a> to live and work in the communities, schools and orphanages for the summer months in conjunction with the Zambian organisation 'Sport In Action'.</p>
<h3>Athletic Union</h3>
<p>The <a>University of St Andrews Athletic Union</a> is the Student representative body for sport.</p>

<h3>Media</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Newspapers:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em><a>The Saint</a></em> is the longest-lived student newspaper, published fortnightly since 1997 and tracing its roots several decades further. It is fully independent of both the Student's Union and the University, which has led to some controversy about certain articles in the past. This independence is only matched by four other student newspapers in Britain - <em><a>Felix</a></em> at <a>Imperial College London</a>, <em><a>Cherwell</a></em> in <a>Oxford</a>, <em><a>Varsity</a></em> in <a>Cambridge</a> and <em>The Inquirer</em> at <a>City University</a> in London</li>
      <li>On 17 April 2006, the <em>Vine</em> magazine (supported by the Students' Association) was re-launched. The magazine claimed to generate discussion and thought throughout the student population of the town, and was printed at irregular intervals. Sales were poor, and the publication eventually closed down in 2007.</li>
      <li><a>The Tribe</a> &quot;an off-beat art and lifestyle publication appealing to University of St Andrews students passionate about journalism and photography&quot; was launched in 2009.</li>
      <li>The Regulus Magazine, founded in January 2010, is a student-run publication entirely devoted to political and economic affairs featuring contributions from prestigious members of the international community.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Academic Journals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2007 the James Crichton Society was created to foster &quot;academic inquiry and discussion&quot;. It produced a monthly journal but has since ceased to publish.</li>
      <li>St. Andrews Psychology Review (S.P.R.) founded in 2008 in association with St. Andrews Psychology Department and The St. Andrews Psychology Society (independently funded and not affiliated with The St. Andrews Student Union). While it is the first Independent Academic Journal at The University St. Andrews it has a number of individuals who aren&#x2019;t university staff or students as writers and staff.</li>
      <li>Aporia (The Philosophy Society Journal) A biannual philosophy journal, founded in 2006, that features undergraduates, graduates, and postgraduates from around the UK.</li>
      <li>Ha@sta, a student produced annual journal for those interested in the History of Art has been published since 1995.</li>
      <li>There is a postgraduate journal for Museum and Gallery Studies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Radio:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On 28 February 2005, a number of St Andrews students launched the University's first <a>FM</a> station broadcasting over 5&nbsp;km on the 87.7 <a>MHz</a> frequency. The station was granted a <a>Restricted Service Licence</a> by <a>Ofcom</a>, which allowed for six hours of broadcast a day. Subsequent periods of broadcast followed until the end of 2007, when it was decided to re-brand Star FM as <a>STAR</a> or <a>St Andrews Radio</a> and broadcast solely as an Internet station online for twenty-four hours a day. The radio station is now a sub-committee of the Students' Association under the name of the Broadcasting Committee. It broadcasts 24/7 during University term time. The station can be found at www.standrewsradio.com.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Web:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An independent website has been set up by students at the University for topical discussion and an unbiased review of the town and University. This can be found at <a>TheSinner.net</a></li>
      <li>On 15 August 2009, a group of independent St Andrews students launched a detailed and interactive unofficial  'survival guide' for incoming undergraduates, providing information on the town and university life. The guide features a <a>Twitter</a> feed to interact with new students and a newsletter that encourages dialogue with current students. The guide is at <a>StAndrewsFreshers.com</a>.</li>
      <li>In 2010 <a>StAnd Science</a>, a student science and technology blog was launched. At the end of March 2010 its first paper issue will be launched.</li>
