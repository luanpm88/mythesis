<p>The <strong>Carnegie Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>CIT</strong>), is the name for <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a>&#x2019;s College of Engineering. It was first called the Carnegie Technical Schools, or Carnegie Tech, when it was founded in 1900 by <a>Andrew Carnegie</a> who intended to build a &#x201c;first class technical school&#x201d; in <a>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, for the sons of local steel mill workers. Since its inception more than 100 years ago, the school&#x2019;s original four programs have expanded into Carnegie Mellon University. Today, CIT has seven departments of study and is consistently ranked one of the top ten engineering programs in the nation.</p>
<p>There are approximately 1,650 full-time undergraduate, 620 master&#x2019;s, and 680 doctoral students enrolled at CIT. The college employs 170 faculty members whose research is recognized and supported by such sources as the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Health, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of Carnegie Mellon University, the College of Engineering works to carry out the university&#x2019;s mission of &#x201c;changing the needs of society by building on its traditions of innovation, problem solving and interdisciplinarity&#x201d; . Students in the College of Engineering have the advantage of working with experts in their own field of study, as well as with students and faculty across the other engineering departments and academic colleges.  Because of the college&#x2019;s small size and focus on interdisciplinary collaboration, students graduate with a high-quality education that extends far beyond their expert technical knowledge, ensuring they have the problem-solving skills needed to be successful in a diverse collection of individual careers . </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1905, the massive buildings of the Carnegie Technical Schools began to rise out of a barren field east of the city. Applications poured in, and the first students of the School of Science and Technology began classes in unfinished buildings, still surrounded by the sounds of construction. In 1908 the first graduating class of Carnegie Tech consisted of 58 students and a year&#x2019;s tuition was a whopping five dollars.  </p>
<p>In 1912 the Carnegie Technical Schools officially became the Carnegie Institute of Technology when the school earned accreditation and began offering four-year degrees. By this time the School of Science and Technology was joined by three additional academic programs - the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School. CIT continued to expand, offering its first master&#x2019;s degree program in 1914 and its first engineering doctoral degree in 1920. </p>
<p>In 1937 the school&#x2019;s president, Thomas Doherty, divided it into two distinct branches &#x2013; scientific and humanistic-social. Both of these branches excelled and CIT became well-known not only for its engineering and science programs, but also for its progressive programs in drama and fine arts. CIT&#x2019;s recognition as an academically prominent institution set the stage for a merger with <a>Mellon Institute</a>, the prototype of modern applied research institutes. In 1967, Carnegie Mellon University emerged from the union as one of the nation&#x2019;s most prestigious research universities. </p>
<p>In 1970 the College of Science and Engineering was divided into the <a>Mellon College of Science</a> and the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or the College of Engineering. </p>
<p>CIT has led the way in many engineering fields and trends, establishing the nation&#x2019;s first robotics institute in 1978 and the <a>Information Networking Institute</a> in 1989 .</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s College of Engineering offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in seven academic departments and two institutes:<a>thumb|350px|Hamerschlag Hall is one of the principal teaching facilities of the College of Engineering</a> </p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary graduate programs</h3>
<p>In addition to graduate degrees in the traditional disciplines, CIT offers the following interdisciplinary programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Energy, Science, Technology and Policy</a></li>
  <li><a>Engineering and Technology Innovation Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Colloids, Polymers and Surfaces</a></li>
  <li><a>Architecture-Engineering Construction Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Product Development</a></li>
  <li><a>Air Quality Engineering</a></li>
  <li><a>Engineering/MBA 5-year Integrated Program </a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bi-Coastal/international campuses and programs</h3>
<p>CIT is a global institution that offers graduate students around the world opportunities for a top 10 Engineering Program.</p>
<p><a><strong>Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley</strong></a>  &lt;br /&gt; In 2002 Carnegie Mellon University established a Silicon Valley campus at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California to expand the reach of its outstanding professional programs and to perform innovative research that connects it to the high tech companies in the region. In collaboration with CIT they offer two bi-coastal engineering degrees: <a>MS Engineering &amp; Technology Innovation Management</a>, and <a>PhD Electrical and Computer Engineering-Mobility</a>. </p>
<p><a><strong>Carnegie Mellon|Portugal</strong></a>  &lt;br /&gt; The Carnegie Mellon|Portugal Program is a collaborative program between Carnegie Mellon and several universities and companies in Portugal.  &lt;br /&gt; <strong>M.S. Information Technology &#x2013; Information Security</strong> (MSIT- IS) &lt;br /&gt; In partnership with Faculdade de Ci&#x00ea;ncias, <a>Universidade de Lisboa</a> (FCUL) in Portugal, INI offers a masters program that prepares students for leadership in information security by blending education in information security technology, business management and policy. The program uses a hybrid distance education model in which select classes are taught from Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s Pittsburgh campus through teleconferencing technology and the remaining courses taught locally at the University of Lisbon by its faculty.</p>
<p><strong>PH.D in Technological Change and Entrepreneurship</strong> &lt;br /&gt; In association with the Carnegie Mellon|Portugal Program&#x2019;s Information and Communications Technology Institute (ICTI), this is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in the area of Technological Change and Entrepreneurship. Graduates of the Ph.D. program receive a degree by Carnegie Mellon University, as well as one awarded by the Portuguese Partner University (either <a>Technical University of Lisbon</a> or <a>Catholic University of Portugal</a>).</p>
<p><strong>CIT-USACH Research and Education Collaboration</strong> &lt;br /&gt; CIT and the School of Engineering at the <a>University of Santiago</a> in Chile (USACH) have a joint collaborative agreement for research and education. The program encourages the exchange of engineering students, faculty, and scholars pursuing and participating in mutually agreed scientific research and study. There are also opportunities for professional internships where appropriate. </p>
<p><strong>MS Information Technology &#x2013; Information Security</strong> (MSIT-IS) &lt;br /&gt; In collaboration with Hyogo Institute of Information Education Foundation, the INI offers a Master of Science in Information Technology - Information Security Track (MSIT-IS) at Carnegie Mellon CyLab Japan. The degree is a joint initiative between the INI and the <a>H. John Heinz III College's School of Public Policy and Management</a>. The MSIT-IS degree prepares students to become leaders in information security by blending education in information security technology, business management, and policy.</p>
