<p>KAIST was established under the name of Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS) under a special law on February 16, 1971, as the first research oriented graduate school in science and engineering in Korea. In 1989, KAIST established the education/research system of special talents in science and engineering fields in bachelor, master and doctoral degrees. Students accepted into the extraordinarily competitive program, were exempt from military duty, but required to remain in Korea for 5 years following graduation, to prevent <a>brain drain</a>. All other Koreans, of college age, are required to do military duty, unless they are in college, then they must report for military duty soon afterward.</p>
<p>[[Image:Korean scientist-Jang Yeongsil-01.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A statue of [[Jang Young Sil]], a Korean Scientist, in front of science library, Daejeon campus]] KAIST has led other colleges and research institutions in Korea and was verified by the <a>ABET</a> assessment (graduate course is within 10% of top US college level) in 1992, evaluation of nationwide colleges by Joongang Ilbo (1995, 1998&#x2013;2001, 2006, 2008-2010: number one in overall rank, and evaluation of Asian colleges by Asiaweek (1999~2000: Number one in science and technology), Chosun Ilbo evaluation of Asian colleges(2009,overall rank number one in the nation, 7th in Asia, world university ranking of The Times newspaper(2008: 34th of Top 100 world university in Technology) and others.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, KAIST has produced 8,453 bachelors, 17,762 masters, 6,726 doctorate holders (doctors under 30 years of age were 2,920, 43.4%) giving a total of 32,941 alumni. The thesis published in SCI (US, Science and Technology Quotation Thesis Search) journals reached approximately 4 articles per each faculty member, and the commissioned research grant was approximately 200 million won per each facility, which is world-class level. The famous scientific publications such as&#x300c;Nature&#x300d; (GB, July 1993) and &#x300c;Science&#x300d; (USA, October 1993) have assessed that, &#x201c;KAIST has the potential to be the world best level education institution.&#x201d;</p>
<p>It founded the National Nano Lab in 2002 and established the KAIST Institute in 2006.</p>
<p>The first act of President Suh upon his inauguration in July 2006 was to lay out the KAIST Development Plan. The &#x2018;KAIST Development Five-Year Plan&#x2019; was finalized on February 5, 2007 by KAIST Steering Committee after a thorough examination. The goals of KAIST set by Suh are to become one of the best science and technology universities in the world, and to become one of the top-10 universities by 2011.</p>
<p>In January 2008, the university dropped its full name, <em>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</em>, and changed its official name to only <em>KAIST</em>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>'KAIST' Decides Not to Use Original Full Name</a>, KAIST announcement, January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Academic Program</h2>

<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p>Researchers at the <a>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called <a>Online Electric Vehicle</a>,  OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via <a>non-contact magnetic charging</a>, (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself. As a possible solution to traffic congestion and to improve overall efficiency by minimizing air resistance and so reduce energy consumption, the test vehicles followed the power track in a <a>convoy</a>. In July 2009 the researchers successfully supplied up to 60% power to a bus over a <a>gap</a> of  from a power line embedded in the ground using power supply and pick up technology developed in-house.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
