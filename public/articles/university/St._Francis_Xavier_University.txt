<p>In 1866, St.Francis Xavier College was given university status, becoming St. Francis Xavier University and awarding its first degrees in 1868. </p>
<p>In 1883, Mount St Bernard Academy, was founded for female education teaching from primary grades to twelve and taught by the <a>Sisters of Notre Dame</a>. </p>
<p>In 1894, the academy affiliated with St Francis Xavier University as Mount St Bernard College. </p>
<p>In 1897 the school became the first co-educational Catholic university in North America to grant degrees to women.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.</p>

The university has also ranked first in alumni support for the past six years (2001&#x2013;2006). This In 2007 <em><a>Maclean's Magazine</a></em> had changed the requirements for being the best &quot;Primarily Undergraduate&quot; university and it put the university in 3rd place in the <em>Primarily Undergraduate</em> category, having been replaced by two other Atlantic Canadian universities, who tied for first place.  However early in 2009, Maclean's did report that according to students, St FX University ranked 1st in choosing to return to their current institution among other categories.</p>

<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Physical Sciences Centre Classroom</a></p>
<p>Approximately 50% of students at St. Francis Xavier live on-campus in the university's traditional residences or apartment-style housing. Students who live in traditional residence are registered in a mandatory meal plan at the central dining facility, Morrison Hall. Residents may choose to buy a plan consisting of 11, 14, or 17 meals per week, with unused meals forfeited at the end of each month. Alternatively students may also choose to enroll in a block plan that provides a specificied number of meals, which are usable anytime but are forfeited if unused by the end of the year. Apartment-style residences consist typically of four bedroom apartments with 2 full bathrooms and a small kitchen. All students in residence regardless of housing style are required to purchase a minimum amount of &quot;declining cash balance&quot; or DCB, which is loaded onto student ID cards and can be used at any of the food outlets on campus. St. FX has an exclusive contract with <a>Sodexo</a> giving that company a monopoly on food and conference services at every facility on campus.</p>

<h2>X-Ring</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left| Actual X-Ring Graduates Receive on December 3rd of their fourth and final year</a></p>
<p>St. Francis Xavier University is known for its distinctive X-Ring, awarded to students on December 3 of each year before their graduation. December 3 marks the feast day of the University's patron saint and namesake, Saint <a>Francis Xavier</a>. On average, more than 95% of the graduating class opt for the ring.</p>
<p>The X-Ring is presented to students in a ceremony during the afternoon, which only recipients may attend. Traditionally, this ceremony was held in the University Chapel; however, in recent years it has been hosted in the <a>Charles V. Keating Millennium Centre</a>. There is typically a live video link of the ceremony available for family and friends to watch from across the world or from a large screen set up in the Oland Centre on campus.</p>
<p>[[File:SchwartzSchoolCupola.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Gerald Schwartz School of Business]]]]</p>
<p>Each X-Ring is engraved with initials and other distinguishing marks so that no two rings are exactly alike. This ensures that if an X-Ring is ever lost, the finder can send it back to the University and the original owner can be traced. </p>
<p>In addition to those awarded to students, there is one Honorary X-Ring awarded annually. The X-Ring Eligibility Policy states that this recipient must not already hold an X-Ring, and must demonstrate outstanding contribution to the Xaverian community and be exemplary of the Xaverian motto: &quot;Quaecumque sunt vera&quot; (Whatsoever things are true).</p>
