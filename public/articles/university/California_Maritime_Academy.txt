<p>The <strong>California Maritime Academy</strong> (also known as <strong>CMA</strong>, <strong>Cal Maritime</strong>, and <strong>CSU, Maritime</strong>) is one of 23 campuses in the <a>California State University</a> system and is one of only seven degree-granting maritime academies in the <a>United States</a>.  It is located in <a>Vallejo</a>, <a>California</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cal Maritime was established as the <strong>California Nautical School</strong> in 1929 when the California State Assembly Bill no. 253 was signed into law by Governor <a>C. C. Young</a>.  The bill authorized the creation of the school, appointment of a Board of Governors to manage the school and the acquisition of a training vessel.  The school's mission was &quot;<em>to give practical and theoretical instruction in navigation, seamanship, steam engines, gas engines, and electricity in order to prepare young men to serve as officers in the American Merchant Marine.</em>&quot;  By 1930 a training vessel and a school site was acquired, the original location of what would become Cal Maritime was California City (now <a>Tiburon, California</a>) in the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the <a>Great Depression</a>, the early days of the Academy were full of financial uncertainty.  As early as 1933, some state legislators were calling for the school's abolition. In order to save money, the cadets and instructors alike lived and held classes aboard the training vessel, the <em>T.S. California State</em>.  Only after the passage of the <a>Merchant Marine Act of 1936</a> did the funding for the Academy become stabilized.</p>

<p>In 1939 the California Nautical School adopted its present name, the <strong>California Maritime Academy</strong>.  By 1940 the Academy was granting Bachelor of Science degrees and Naval Reserve commissions to its graduates; this step marked the beginning of the transition from the status of trade school to college.  During <a>World War II</a> the Academy moved to its present location in <a>Vallejo, California</a> in 1943.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, after surviving another round of budget cuts and calls for the Academy's abolition, Cal Maritime became a four-year institution.  The 1970s also marked the time when the first minority and female cadets graduated from Cal Maritime.</p>
<p>In 1996 Cal Maritime became the twenty-second campus of the California State University system.  The new affiliation improved the academy's funding prospects considerably. The current training vessel is the <em><a>T.S. Golden Bear</a></em>, and is the third training ship to carry that name.</p>

<p>Cal Maritime has a long history of athletic activities. Before it joined regular intercollegiate athletics, the teams from Cal Maritime usually played military teams from local bases.  Cal Maritime began to organize its sports under intercollegiate guidelines in the 1970s and the student body chose the &quot;Keelhaulers&quot; as the Academy's mascot.  Until then the Cal Maritime teams were known as the Seawolves.</p>
<p>Today, Cal Maritime is a member of the <a>NAIA</a> and the Men's Soccer, Basketball, Golf and Women's Volleyball teams are charter members of the <a>California Pacific Conference</a>.

<p>Cal Maritime's Rugby team, despite the small size of the school, has been nationally ranked in club rugby and won the Pacific Coast League's Western Division Championship in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>The University's Sailing team captured the Kennedy Cup - the National Collegiate Sailing Championship - in the fall of 2009.  That victory earned it the right to serve as the U.S. representative in the annual Student World Yachting Cup championships in October 2010 in La Rochelle, France, where it placed 5th of 14.</p>
