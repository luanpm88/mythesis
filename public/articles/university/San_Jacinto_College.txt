<h2>History</h2>
<h5>Getting Started: </h5>
<p>:Established in 1961, the district originally consisted of the areas of <a>Channelview ISD</a>, <a>Deer Park ISD</a>, <a>Galena Park ISD</a>, <a>La Porte ISD</a>, and <a>Pasadena ISD</a>. The district now also serves <a>Sheldon ISD</a>. Some facilities are also located within the boundaries of <a>Clear Creek ISD</a>.</p>
<p>:In May 1960, voters in the Channelview, Deer Park, Galena Park, La Porte, and Pasadena school districts approved the creation of East Harris County Union Junior College, elected seven members to serve on the Board of Regents and authorized the Board of Regents (now Board of Trustees) to levy a tax for the College operations and maintenance. &lt;br /&gt; :On February 16, 1961, the Board of Regents changed the name of the district to The San Jacinto Junior College District. Using renovated buildings in Pasadena, the college welcomed 876 students to its first classes in September 1961. The San Jacinto Junior College District was approved and accredited by the Texas Department of Education when the college opened. The college was granted full membership in the Association of Texas Colleges and Universities on April 6, 1963. On November 4, 1968, Sheldon Independent School District was voted part of the College district.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h5>Expansion:</h5>
<p>:Bonds issued in 1972 included funds for the North Campus. Following five terms of extension classes offered at North Shore High School, the North Campus opened for classes on its site in the fall of 1975. In 1976, bonds were approved for a third campus. After several terms of extension classes offered at J. Frank Dobie High School, San Jacinto College South opened for classes in September 1979.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>:On November 30, 1966, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools first granted San Jacinto College accreditation. The North and South campuses were first accredited in 1976 and 1979, respectively. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation for all three campuses occurred in 1999.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h5>Major Upgrades &amp; Re-accreditation:</h5>
<p>:In December 1999, voters approved the issuing of $91 million in general obligation bonds, allowing us to add six new buildings including the Interactive Learning Centers and Fine Arts Centers along with substantial infrastructure improvements throughout the district. Then in May 2008 another vote earmarked $295 million to create updated science facilities, allied health facilities, library improvements, and physical education facility improvements.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>:This decade of funding has led to some extraordinary growth and innovation. Clear Horizons Early College High School opened its doors on the South campus in the fall of 2007. A partnership with Clear Creek ISD, this program allows students to earn an associate degree while simultaneously earning a high school diploma.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>:San Jacinto College has also faced some tough challenges. In 2008, Hurricane Ike inflicted significant damage to the three campuses. Thanks to the strong college leadership and innovate faculty, students were back in class in less than three weeks with a plan in place for students to complete the semester on time, a fact that didn&#x2019;t elude the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, who awarded the College re-accreditation later that Fall.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>:As the College looks back over the past five decades, it is very proud of the vision, passion and anything-it-takes attitude that has marked this institution&#x2019;s growth. &lt;br&gt;</p>
