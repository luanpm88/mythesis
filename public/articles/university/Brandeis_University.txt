<p><strong>Brandeis University</strong> () is an American <a>private</a> research university with a <a>liberal arts</a> focus. It is located in the southwestern corner of <a>Waltham, Massachusetts</a>, nine miles (14&nbsp;km) west of <a>Boston</a>. The University has an enrollment of approximately 3,200 undergraduate and 2,100 graduate students. In 2010, it was ranked by the <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> as the number 34 national university in the United States. <a>Forbes</a> listed Brandeis University as number 57 among all national universities and liberal arts colleges combined in 2010. </p>
<p>Brandeis was founded in 1948 as a <a>nonsectarian</a> <a>coeducational</a> institution on the site of the former <a>Middlesex University</a>. The university is named for <a>Louis Dembitz Brandeis</a> (1856&#x2013;1941), the first Jewish <a>Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founders</h3>
<p>Names associated with the conception of Brandeis include <a>Israel Goldstein</a>, George Alpert, C. Ruggles Smith, <a>Albert Einstein</a>, and <a>Abram L. Sachar</a>.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|350px|Usen Castle, an iconic building on campus</a></p>
<p>C. Ruggles Smith was the son of Dr. John Hall Smith, founder of <a>Middlesex University</a>, who had died in 1944. In 1946, the university was on the brink of financial collapse. At the time, it was one of the few medical schools in the U. S. that did not impose a <a>Jewish quota</a>; but it had never been able to secure <a>AMA</a> accreditation&#x2014;in part, its founder believed, due to institutional antisemitism in the AMA&#x2014;and, as a result, Massachusetts had all but shut it down. </p>
<p>Israel Goldstein was a prominent rabbi in New York from 1918 until 1960 (when he immigrated to Israel), and an influential <a>Zionist</a>. Before 1946, he had headed the <a>New York Board of Rabbis</a>, the <a>Jewish National Fund</a>, and the <a>Zionist Organization of America</a>, and helped found the <a>National Conference of Christians and Jews</a>. On his eightieth birthday, in Israel, <a>Yitzhak Rabin</a> and other leaders of the government, the parliament, and the Zionist movement assembled at his house to pay him tribute. But among all his accomplishments, the one chosen by the New York Times to headline his obituary was: &quot;Rabbi Israel Goldstein, A Founder of Brandeis.&quot;</p>
<p>C. Ruggles Smith, desperate for a way to save something of Middlesex University, learned of a New York committee headed by Goldstein that was seeking a campus to establish a Jewish-sponsored secular university, and approached Goldstein with a proposal to give the Middlesex campus and charter to Goldstein's committee, in the hope that his committee might &quot;possess the apparent ability to reestablish the School of Medicine on an approved basis.&quot; Goldstein was concerned about being saddled with a failing medical school, but excited about the opportunity to secure a  &quot;campus not far from New York, the premier Jewish community in the world, and only  from Boston, one of the important Jewish population centers.&quot; He is best known today as the father of Richard Alpert (<a>Baba Ram Dass</a>). He was influential in Boston's Jewish community. His Judaism &quot;tended to be social rather than spiritual.&quot; He was involved in assisting children displaced from Germany. Alpert was to be chairman of Brandeis from 1946 to 1954, and a director from 1946 until his death. when he agreed to the establishment of the Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc., until June 22, 1947, when he withdrew his support. </p>
<p>The trustees offered to name the university after Einstein in the summer of 1946, but Einstein declined, and on July 16, 1946 the board decided the university would be named after <a>Louis Brandeis</a>.</p>
<p>On August 19, the plans for the new university were announced by prominent rabbi and Zionist <a>Israel Goldstein</a>, president of the Albert Einstein Foundation. Goldstein said that the planned university was to be supported by contributions from Jewish organizations and individuals, and stressed the point that the institution was to be without quotas and open to all &quot;regardless of race, color, or creed.&quot; The institution was to be &quot;deeply conscious both of the Hebraic tradition of Torah looking upon culture as a birthright, and of the American ideal of an educated democracy.&quot; In later stories the New York Times' capsule characterization of Brandeis was &quot;a Jewish-supported non-quota university.&quot;</p>
<p>The Foundation acquired the campus of the Middlesex University in Waltham, which was almost defunct except for the Middlesex Veterinary and Medical College. The charter of this small and marginal operation was transferred to the Foundation along with the campus. The Foundation had pledged to continue operating it, but began to feel that it would never be more than third-rate, while its operating costs were burdensome at a time when the Foundation was trying to raise funds. Disputes arose whether to try to improve it&#x2014;as Einstein wished&#x2014;or to terminate it.</p>
<p>In 1954 Brandeis inaugurated a graduate program and became fully accredited. The student protesters renamed the school &quot;<a>Malcolm X</a> University&quot; for the duration of the siege (distributing buttons with the new name and logo) and issued a list of ten demands for better minority representation on campus. Most of these demands were subsequently met. Ford Hall was demolished in August 2000 to make way for the Shapiro Campus Center, which was opened and dedicated October 3, 2002.</p>
<h3>Rose Art Museum</h3>
<p> The Rose Art Museum opened in 1961, the result of a decade-long struggle to house the art donations Brandeis had been receiving. Abram Sachar had written of the importance of fine arts to Brandeis and his &quot;determination to expose our students and faculty to every kind of art orientation.&quot; Of the museum itself he had written:</p>
<p>But in response to a university budget shortfall of $10 million, a formerly $700 million endowment now reduced, and the loss of longtime donors who lost money through investments with <a>Bernard Madoff</a>, on January 26, 2009 the university announced it would close the Rose Art Museum in September 2009 and sell off a prized collection of contemporary American art, stating &quot;The bottom line is that the students, the faculty and core academic mission come first. (Trustees) had to look at the college's assets and came to a decision to maintain that fundamental commitment to teaching.&quot;  Amidst protests and criticism, the Massachusetts Attorney General plans to review the planned sale and wills and agreements between the museum and donors.  The university subsequently indicated that it would sell only a limited number of pieces, if any, and would keep the museum open as a teaching and exhibition gallery.</p>
<p>The failure to resolve the university's budget difficulties through the art sell-off led to a decision in May 2009 to suspend the university's contribution to employees' retirement funds for one year.</p>
<p>Brandeis University's president, Jehuda Reinharz, has announced that he will resign at the end of the academic year, The <a>Boston Globe</a> reported. The announcement took many on the campus by surprise, but Mr. Reinharz said the recent criticism over his financial stewardship and plans to close the university's Rose Art Museum was not a factor in his decision. At age 65, he said, he felt the time had come to move on.</p>

<p><a>right|thumb|250px|Shapiro Campus Center</a></p>
<p>The university has an active student government, the <a>Brandeis Student Union</a>, as well as more than 270 student organizations. <a>Fraternities and sororities</a> are officially prohibited by Brandeis University, as they are contrary to a central tenet of the university, namely, that student organizations be open to all students, with membership determined by competency or interest. According to an official handbook, &quot;[e]xclusive or secret societies are inconsistent with the principles of openness to which the University is committed.&quot;</p>
<p>Brandeis has eleven <a>a cappella</a> groups, six undergraduate-run theater companies, one sketch comedy troupe, and four <a>improv-comedy</a> groups, as well as many other cultural and arts clubs. Brandeis is also home to what has been cited as one of the country's few undergraduate-run law publications. Of particular note is the Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society (B.A.D.A.S.S.) which consistently ranks as one of the top 10 <a>debate</a> teams in the United States, and participates across the globe in the <a>World Universities Debating Championships</a> each year.</p>
<p>Cholmondeley's coffeehouse, commonly referred to as &quot;Chums,&quot; is located in Brandeis' <a>Usen Castle</a>. Chums is a popular site for student performances and concerts, including <a>Tracy Chapman</a>, <a>Joan Baez</a>, <a>Matt Pond PA</a>, and <a>Genesis</a> (notable as their first American performance). Cholmondley's is named after a notoriously ill-tempered <a>Basset hound</a> that was the on-campus pet for Ralph Norman, the campus Photographer during the first years of Brandeis. He would roam the campus after dark, growling at students, often nipping at their cuffs and making a general nuisance of himself. After his death, the coffee house was named for him, not so much in remembrance but in celebration.</p>
<p>Brandeis University's Campus Sustainability Initiative seeks to reduce the University's environmental and climate change impact.  The University's accomplishments in the arena of <a>sustainability</a> include the creation of a student-organized on-campus Farmers' Market, the implementation of a <a>single-stream recycling</a> program, and the transition to GreenE certified wind power for 15% of the school's electricity needs.  Brandeis also offers a course called &quot;Greening the Campus and Community,&quot; in which students &quot;examine the environmental impacts of the Brandeis and Waltham community, and then design and implement projects to address those impacts.&quot; Student projects have included greening campus offices, running after-school environmental education programs for children in the Waltham schools, and cleaning up local streams and ponds. which does not charge a fee for any of its emergency services.</p>
<p>Security escort services are provided around the campus and into Waltham by the student-run &quot;Branvan,&quot; which  runs on a daily schedule from 4:00 pm to 2:30 am on weekdays and from 12:00 pm to 2:30 am on weekends. </p>
<p>The university is  west of Boston and is accessible through <a>Brandeis/Roberts station</a> on the <a>Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line</a>, a free shuttle that services Boston and Cambridge (<a>Harvard Square</a>) Thursday through Sunday, the nearby <a>Riverside subway station</a> (above ground) on the <a>Green Line</a>, and the 553 <a>MBTA Bus</a>.</p>
<h2>Wien International Scholarship</h2>
<p>Wien International Scholarship is a scholarship instituted by Brandeis University for international undergraduate students. The Wien International Scholarship was established in 1958 by <a>Lawrence A.</a> and Mae Wien. The Wien family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the <a>United Nations</a> in <a>New York City</a>, and did relief work in <a>New Orleans</a> following <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>. In April 2008, the University hosted a 3-day long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.</p>
<h2>Institute for Informal Jewish Education</h2>
<p>The Institute for Informal Jewish Education aims to support Jewish educators in creating meaningful Jewish experiences through professional development opportunities including pre-service experiences, in-service experiences related to educators&#x2019; practice, practitioner research, curriculum development, and strategic organizational support. The IJE is funded partially through grants, from The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies, The Legacy Heritage Fund, The Covenant Foundation, and <a>AVI CHAI Foundation</a>.</p>
