<p>The <strong>Royal College of Music</strong> is a <a>conservatoire</a> located in <a>South Kensington</a>, <a>London</a>, <a>England</a>. </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Royal College of Music was founded by Royal Charter in 1882. The first director was Sir <a>George Grove</a> and he was followed by Sir <a>Hubert Parry</a>. The first building was opposite the west side to the Royal Albert Hall but by 1887 the college was seeking to move to larger premises.</p>
<p>The college's current building, of red brick dressed with buff-coloured Welden stone, designed by Sir <a>Arthur Blomfield</a> in <a>Flemish Mannerist</a> style and built in 1892-94, is situated on <a>Prince Consort Road</a> in the district of <a>South Kensington</a>, next to <a>Imperial College</a>, directly opposite the <a>Royal Albert Hall</a>, near the <a>Royal College of Art</a> and five minutes' walk from the <a>Science</a>, <a>Natural History</a> and <a>Victoria and Albert</a> Museums. The dense presence of these cultural institutions has earned this Kensington neighbourhood the nickname of <a>Albertopolis</a>.</p>
<p>The new college building was largely paid for by two large donations from <a>Samson Fox</a>, a Yorkshire industrialist, whose statue, along with that of the Prince of Wales, stands in the entrance hall.  A hall of residence serving 170 students was opened in 1994 on Goldhawk Road in <a>Shepherd's Bush</a>, west <a>London</a>.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1882 and the state opening of its building on 2 May 1894 by the Prince of Wales, later <a>Edward VII</a>, the College has been linked with the Royal family. Its patron is currently Her Majesty, <a>The Queen</a>. For 40 years, Her Majesty <a>Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a> was President; in 1993 HRH <a>The Prince of Wales</a> became President, Her Majesty The Queen Mother becoming President Emerita. </p>
<p>The College is a <a>registered charity</a> under English law. Its current director is the clarinettist and scholar Professor Colin Lawson.</p>
<h2>Curriculum</h2>
<p>The college teaches all aspects of Western <a>classical music</a> from undergraduate to doctoral level. There is a Junior Department, where 300 children aged 8 to 18 are educated on Saturdays, under the scrutiny of Director; Peter Hewitt BA PGCE HonRCM FRSA. It also has an extensive museum of <a>musical instrument</a>s which is open to the public, see below.</p>
<h2>Performance venues</h2>
<p>The RCM's main concert venue is the <a>Amaryllis Fleming Concert Hall</a> a 468 seat barrel-vaulted concert hall designed by Sir <a>Arthur Blomfield</a>, built in 1901 and extensively restored in 2008/9. The <a>Britten Theatre</a>, which seats 400, was opened by <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1986 and is used for opera, ballet, music and theatre. There is also a 150 seat recital hall dating from 1965, as well as several smaller recital rooms, including three organ-equipped <a>Parry Rooms</a>.</p>

<h2>Other collections</h2>
<p>Due partly to the vision of its founders, particularly Sir <a>George Grove</a>, the RCM holds significant research collections of material dating from the fifteenth century onwards.  These include autographs such as <a>Haydn</a>&#x2019;s String Quartet Op. 64/1, <a>Mozart</a>&#x2019;s <a>Piano Concerto K491</a> and <a>Elgar</a>&#x2019;s <a>Cello Concerto</a>. More extensive collections feature the music of <a>Herbert Howells</a>, <a>Frank Bridge</a> and <a>Malcolm Arnold</a> and film scores by <a>Stanley Myers</a>. Amongst over 300 original portraits are <a>John Cawse</a>&#x2019;s 1826 painting of <a>Weber</a> (the last of the composer), <a>Haydn</a> by Thomas Hardy (1791) and Bartolommeo Nazari's painting of <a>Farinelli</a> at the height of his fame. A recent addition to the Collection is a portrait of Russian composer Alfred Schnittke by Irish artist Reginald Gray.</p>
<p>10,000 <a>print</a>s and <a>photograph</a>s comprise the most substantial archive of images of musicians in the UK. The RCM&#x2019;s 600,000 concert <a>programme</a>s document concert life from 1730 to the present day. Paintings on display at the Museum include two portraits of <a>Jan Ladislav Dussek</a> and <a>George Henschel</a>.</p>
