<p><strong>Jadavpur University</strong> (<strong>JU</strong>) () is an educational and research institution in <a>India</a>. It is located in <a>Kolkata</a>, <a>West Bengal</a> and comprises two campuses - the main campus at <a>Jadavpur</a> and the new campus at <a>Salt Lake</a>. Jadavpur University is also closely affiliated to leading research institutes like the <a>Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science</a>, <a>Indian Institute of Chemical Biology</a> and the <a>Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>University Grants Commission</a> has identified JU as one of the first five universities in the country with &quot;Potential for Excellence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Jadavpur University has been accorded the highest grading and rated as a &quot;Five Star University&quot; in India by the <a>National Assessment and Accreditation Council</a>. JU was also nominated as the lead institution for TEQIP, a <a>World Bank</a> funded program in India.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Golden Jubilee logo of Jadavpur University</a> The National Council of Education (NCE) was set up in 1906 to impart literary, scientific and technical education on a national basis. The year was significant in Bengal's history as the province had just been partitioned by <a>Lord Curzon</a>, the <a>Governor-General of India</a>, into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become <a>Bangladesh</a> in 1971) and West Bengal and <a>Orissa</a> on the other. In 1906, a group of Bengali intellectuals including <a>Rabindranath Tagore</a>, <a>Aurobindo Ghosh</a>, Raja <a>Subodh Chandra Mullick</a> and <a>Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury</a> decided that they would protest the partition of Bengal by setting up an institution that would challenge British rule by offering education to the masses 'on national lines and under national control'. The NCE was set up with <a>Rashbihari Ghosh</a> as its first president.</p>
<p>Almost on the same day a rival organisation, the Society for Promotion of Technical Education in Bengal, was set up by <a>Taraknath Palit</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Haridas Mukherjee and Uma Mukherjee, <em>The Origins of the National Education Movement</em> (Calcutta: National Council of Education, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and under it the Bengal Technical Institute came into being on July 25, 1906. The two organisations fought it out for a few years until the SPTE was amalgamated with the NCE in 1910 and the Bengal Technical Institute passed into its hands. In 1921 the Institute became the first in <a>India</a> to introduce <a>Chemical Engineering</a> as a discipline. By 1940, the institute was virtually functioning as an independent university, and after <a>Indian Independence</a> in 1947, the <a>West Bengal State Legislature</a>, with the concurrence of the <a>Government of India</a>, enacted the Jadavpur University Act, 1955 to convert the institute into Jadavpur University with full autonomy on (December 24, 1955). Since then the university has observed this date in its calendar as Convocation Day.</p>
<h2>The University Emblem</h2>
<p>The emblem of the university is a three-flamed lamp encircled by Lotus petals. The Lamp represents Knowledge. The three flames represent-Intellectual Training, Cultivation of Emotions and Imagination, and Spiritual Development. Petals of the Lotus on the periphery represent Fine Arts and Culture. The logo was designed by the Late <a>Nandalal Bose</a>, a key member of the <a>Bengal school of art</a>, who was also one of the great masters at <a>Kala Bhavan</a> in <a>Rabindranath Tagore</a>'s <a>Visva-Bharati University</a> in <a>Santiniketan</a>. As sthe university celebrated its Golden Jubilee on December 24, 2005, a special emblem (see above) was created to commemorate the occasion, and the motto 'To Know is to Grow' was coined. This date was also the centenary of the National Council of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Lal, Rama Prasad De, and Amrita Sen, <em>The Lamp in the Lotus: A History of Jadavpur University</em> hj(Calcutta: Jadavpur University, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Engineering Science building, Jadavpur University.</a></p>
<p>Jadavpur University operates out of two urban campuses, one in <a>Jadavpur</a> (58 acres) and another in Salt Lake (26 acres). It recently acquired National Instruments, a defunct <a>CSIR</a> located in Jadavpur, becoming the first Indian university to so.  The main campus in Jadavpur houses most of the departments of the three faculties- Engineering, Science and Arts in addition to the Jadavpur University Central Library and the Blue Earth Workshop. Five engineering departments operate out of the Salt Lake campus. The main ground at the Salt Lake campus has been leased out to the Cricket Association of Bengal and it often plays host to various inter and intra state cricket matches. The new National Instruments campus is expected to add much needed space for new laboratories especially for the Departments of Electrical, Electronics &amp; Telecommunication and Computer Engineering.</p>
<p>Recently, Jadavpur University has been considered to be upgraded to a <a>Central University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Publication House</h2>
<p>In 26 October 2010 the institution announced plans to launch a publication house, named Jadavpur University Press, though no date was given. The main focus of the publication house will be to publish textbooks and thesis written by research scholars and authors from all universities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Jadavpur University is primarily a unitary university with faculties in Engineering, Science and Arts. However, few specialized institutes are affiliated to it such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jadavpur Vidyapith College of Education</li>
  <li><a>Institute of Business Management</a></li>
  <li>J. D. Birla Institute</li>
</ul>
<p>Admission to JU is competitive, especially for the engineering courses. Undergraduate students are admitted through <a>WBJEE</a>, an entrance examination for students all over India. There is no <a>domicile</a> quota in JU. Postgraduate students are admitted through <a>GATE</a>.</p>
<h2>Placements</h2>
<p>For good placements of students the university offers Industrial Training facilities such as Factory Training and Soft Skill trainings. Officer of Placement and Training is responsible for placements and provides assistance and guidance to the students. About 100 companies come each year for campus recruitment during pre final year. Rate of placement from campus is around 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; JU reported about 350 job placements on the first 3 months of the 2010-2011 placement season, though the number is unverified.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Jadavpur University placement status - Placements Updates 2010-11 - about 350 Offer</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Sanskriti</h2>
