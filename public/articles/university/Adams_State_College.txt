<p><strong>Adams State College</strong> is a small state-supported <a>liberal arts</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Alamosa</a>, <a>Colorado</a>, <a>U.S.</a>, in the <a>San Luis Valley</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Adams State was founded in 1921 as a <a>teacher's college</a> but now offers a variety of programs including masters degrees in many fields. Billy Adams, a <a>Colorado</a> legislator who would later become governor, worked for three decades before obtaining the authorization to found Adams State Normal School in 1921. His goal was to educate teachers for remote, rural areas, such as the <a>San Luis Valley</a>. The college's first graduate, [<a>http://www.adams.edu/about/asc_history.pdf</a>] in 1926, was Harriett Dalzell Hester, who went on to become the school's librarian and Alamosa County's schools superintendent. With only a grade school education himself, Adams came to the SLV in 1879 at the age of 17 to begin ranching. Within three years, he was mayor of <a>Alamosa</a>. Alamosa was a rough-hewn town in those days. The Rio Grande typically flooded each spring, turning Main Street to mud. Once the college was built, a hedge of <a>Russian olive</a>s had to be planted along the campus edge to keep out herds of horses. Then, as now, potatoes were the area&#x2019;s primary cash crop. But grain and vegetables were also raised, as well as cattle, sheep and pigs. The <a>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad</a> shipped them east. The perseverance demonstrated by Billy Adams in founding his teachers college also characterized those who took over the task of making Adams State more than a dream. The communities of Alamosa and the San Luis Valley faithfully supported the efforts of individuals such as Dr. <a>Ira Richardson</a>, the college&#x2019;s first president. Billy Adams died in 1954, just shy of his 93rd birthday. He left the school $10,000. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|Adams State College Theatre Building</a> --&gt;</p>
