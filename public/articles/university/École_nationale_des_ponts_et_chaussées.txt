<p>Founded in 1747, the <strong>&#x00c9;cole nationale des ponts et chauss&#x00e9;es</strong> (ENPC) (literally &quot;National school of Bridges and Roads&quot;), often referred to as <strong>les Ponts</strong>, is the world's oldest civil engineering school. It remains to this day one of the most prestigious and selective <a>French</a> <a>Grandes &#x00c9;coles</a>.</p>
<p>It is headquartered in <a>Marne-la-Vall&#x00e9;e</a> (<a>suburb</a> of <a>Paris</a>). It is the oldest and among the most prestigious institutes members of <a>ParisTech</a> (Paris Institute of Technology).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1747-1794: Origins</h3>
<p>Following the creation of the <a>Corps of Bridges and Roads</a> in 1716, the <a>King's Council</a> decided in 1747 to found a specific training course for the state's engineers, as &#x00c9;cole royale des ponts et chauss&#x00e9;es. In 1775, the school took its current name as &#x00c9;cole nationale des ponts et chauss&#x00e9;es.</p>
<p>The school's first director, from 1747 until 1794, was <a>Jean-Rodolphe Perronet</a>, engineer, civil service administrator and a contributor to the <a>Encyclop&#x00e9;die</a> of <a>Denis Diderot</a> and <a>Jean le Rond d'Alembert</a>. Without lecturer, fifty students initially taught themselves <a>geometry</a>, <a>algebra</a>, <a>mechanics</a> and <a>hydraulics</a>.</p>
<h3>1794-1945: Growth and industrialisation</h3>
<p>During the <a>First French Empire</a>, a number of members of the Corps of Bridges and Roads (including <a>Barr&#x00e9; de Saint-Venant</a>, <a>Belgrand</a>, <a>Biot</a>, <a>Cauchy</a>, <a>Coriolis</a>, <a>Dupuit</a>, <a>Fresnel</a>, <a>Gay-Lussac</a>, <a>Navier</a>, <a>Vicat</a>) took part in the reconstruction of the French road network that had not been maintained during the <a>Revolution</a>, and in large infrastructural developments, notably hydraulic projects.</p>
<h3>From 1945: Modernisation</h3>
<h2>Teaching and degrees</h2>
<p>With traditional core competences in civil engineering, environment, transport, town and regional planning, mechanics, industrial management and logistics, &#x00c9;cole des Ponts ParisTech offers high-level programmes in an extensive range of fields, from applied mathematics to economics and management.</p>
<p>&#x00c9;cole des Ponts ParisTech is among the schools called &quot;g&#x00e9;n&#x00e9;ralistes&quot;, which means that students receive a broad, management-oriented and non-specialised education, and often quickly become top industrial managers.</p>
<p>Three major types of programmes are on offer :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineering programmes: leading to a 5-year postgraduate engineering degree (accessible, after competitive examinations, by both undergraduate-graduate curriculum and the 2-year master course) or to masters of science </li>
  <li>Doctoral programmes:  <a>Ph.D.</a>s </li>
  <li>Professional programmes for postgraduates: <em>Mast&#x00e8;res sp&#x00e9;cialis&#x00e9;s</em> (M.S.), <a>MBA</a>.</li>
  <li>In conjunction with <a>Temple University</a>-Philadelphia, USA, &#x00c9;cole des Ponts ParisTech is the first leg of the <a>Fox School of Business International MBA</a>, with study in Paris, Philadelphia, and Tokyo.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x00c9;cole des Ponts ParisTech is also an application school of <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a>, and provides education for the <a>Corps of Bridges and Roads</a>.</p>
<h3>Departments</h3>
<p>Education for the Master of Engineering is organised in the six following departments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Civil Engineering and Construction</li>
  <li>Transport, Planning, Environment</li>
  <li>Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science</li>
  <li>Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences</li>
  <li>Economics, Management, Finance</li>
  <li>Industrial Engineering and Management</li>
</ul>
