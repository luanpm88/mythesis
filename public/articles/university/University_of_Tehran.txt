<p> [[File:UTEH gates.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Tehran University main entrance|University of Tehran Entrance]]]] The <strong>University of Tehran</strong> (), also known as <strong>Tehran University</strong> and <strong>UT</strong>, is <a>Iran</a>'s oldest university. Located in <a>Tehran</a>, the university is among the most prestigious in the country, and is consistently selected as the first choice of many applicants in the annual nationwide entrance exam for top Iranian universities. Based on its historical, socio-cultural and political pedigree, as well as its research and teaching profile, UT has been nicknamed &quot;The mother university of Iran&quot; (). The school admits students from across the globe, and is known for offering wide-ranging fields of research. UT houses 111 bachelor degree programs, 177 masters' degree programs, and 156 Ph.D. degree programs.</p>
<p>The adjacent <a>Tehran University of Medical Sciences</a>, although administratively separate, shares the same main campus, and also collaborates in many fields of interest and as such, shares the ethos of one university.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> In 1928 Professor <a>Mahmoud Hessaby</a> has proposed to the Minister of Education, the Late <a>Ali Asghar Hekmat</a> to establish a comprehensive institute that could covers most of the sciences.</p>
<p>The Late <a>Hekmat</a>, in collaboration and consultation with <a>Andre Godard</a> and a team of European architects, selected and designed the master plan of the university's main campus. Most Faculties of the University of Tehran were created by integrating already existing higher education institutions such as <a>Dar al-Funun</a>.</p>
<p>In 1934 the <a>women</a> for the first time admitted to the university, with a policy supporting universal education. In 1934 , the University of Tehran officially inaugurated. In 1945, after WW II, the American troops left a large area in the North of Tehran, called &quot;Amir Abad&quot;; now called Karegar Shomali street, thus a new campus was added to UT. The other colleges and faculties were founded later.</p>
<p>In 1986, by the Iranian legislation called in Persian <a>National Parliament</a>, the university's oversized College of Medicine separated into the independent <a>Tehran University of Medical Sciences</a> (TUMS), coming under the new Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The (TUMS) is the most prestigious medical school in Iran with over 13,000 students. Tehran University of Medical Sciences however publishes all its scientific research under the name &quot;University of Tehran&quot; and continues to enjoy close relations with Tehran University's main campus.</p>
<h2>Colleges</h2>
<p>At present, UT comprises 40 faculties, institutes, and centers of research and education. The university consists of seven campuses:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The central Pardis campus, on Enghelab Ave, is the oldest and the best known of the campuses.</li>
  <li>North Kargar Campus, where the dormitories are mostly located</li>
  <li><a>Karaj</a> campus [<a>http://utcan.ut.ac.ir/en/index.aspx</a>] of agriculture and natural resources</li>
  <li><a>Varamin</a> College</li>
  <li><a>Kish</a> College</li>
  <li><a>Qom</a> College [<a>http://qc.ut.ac.ir/en/index.htm</a>]</li>
  <li>Choka Campus</li>
</ol>

<h2>Emblems</h2>
<p>[[File:Embleme Universite Teheran.jpg|frame|right|The emblem of the University of Tehran was modeled after this [[Sassanid]] <a>stucco</a> relief discovered in <a>Ctesiphon</a>]]</p>
<p>The <a>emblem</a> of the University of Tehran, which was designed by Dr. Mohsen Moghadam, a late faculty member of the Faculty of Fine Arts, is based on an image, which can be found in the <a>stucco</a> relief and seals of the <a>Sasanid</a> period. In this case, it is a copy from a stucco relief discovered in the city of <a>Ctesiphon</a>.</p>
<p>The seal symbolized ownership. In the <a>Sassanid</a> period, these seals were used in stucco <a>reliefs</a>, coins, and silver utensils as a family symbol. Since the alphabet of Sasanid <a>Pahlavi</a>&#x2019;s script was used in these badges, they have the nature of a monogram as well.</p>
<p>The motif is placed between two eagle wings. One can also find these motifs in other images of this period, such as in royal crowns, particularly at the end of the Sasanid period. Crowns with these seals have been called &#x201c;two-feather crowns&#x201d; in The <a>Shahnameh</a>. The motif between the wings was made by combining Pahlavi scripts. Some scholars have tried to read these images. The script is in the form of &#x201c;Afzoot&#x201d; (Amrood), which means plentiful and increasing.</p>

<h2>Political role</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|UT's central mosque has been a center for religious and political activity in Tehran during the past 30 years.</a> University of Tehran's central place in Iranian elite circles has made it the setting for many political events and cultural works.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to historians, the University of Tehran is most notably remembered for its key roles in the political events of recent history. It was in front of the same gates of this school that <a>The Shah's</a> army opened fire on dissident students, killing many and further triggering the <a>1979 revolution</a> of Iran. It was there and 20 years later in July 1999 that, albeit, a much smaller number of dissident students confronted the police.</p>
<p>University of Tehran (UT) has always been a bastion of political movement and ideology. At UT the leaders of the country deliver some of their most potent speeches often on Friday during prayers. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the main campus of the university and its surrounding streets have been the site for Tehran's <a>Friday prayers</a>.</p>
<p>The political and social role of University of Tehran in the Iranian domestic arena has continued to be so pronounced that in November 2005 (to February 2008) a senior Islamic scholar became chancellor of the university, replacing Dr. Faraji-dana (professor of electrical engineering faculty). Ayatollah <a>Abbasali Amid Zanjani</a> (&#x0639;&#x0628;&#x0627;&#x0633;&#x0639;&#x0644;&#x06cc; &#x0639;&#x0645;&#x064a;&#x062f; &#x0632;&#x0646;&#x062c;&#x0627;&#x0646;&#x06cc;) is a professor in Law, is known for his strong ties to Ayatollah <a>Khomeini</a> in the 1979 revolution, and had spent time in the Shah's prisons before the Islamic Revolution. In February 2008, an Iranian economist, Dr. Farhad Rahbar, a former vice president of Iran and head of Management and Planning Organization of Iran, became the new (31st) chancellor of the university.</p>
<p>One hundred and nineteen faculty members of the University of Tehran is said to have resigned on June 15, 2009 to protest the attack on university dorms in the wake of contested <a>2009 presidential elections</a>.</p>
