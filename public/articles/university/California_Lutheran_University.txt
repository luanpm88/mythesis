<h2>History</h2>
<p>CLU was founded in 1959 as California Lutheran College (the name was changed to University in 1986) on farmland donated by the Pederson family, who were among many <a>Scandinavia</a>n immigrants populating the hills of Thousand Oaks. The Scandinavian influence has stayed with the school since its founding. Every spring, a cultural festival is held on campus to celebrate the Scandinavian heritage of the school and the Conejo Valley. Many buildings on campus and streets in the area are named for prominent Scandinavians who helped establish CLU.</p>
<p>Orville Dahl, Ed. D. was the first president of the College from 1959-1962. Dahl had many ambitious dreams for what the college was to become. He originally thought that the Pederson and Thompson dormitories would be hotels for on campus guests and families of students. These residence halls are still in use for present day freshmen. Dahl had dreamed of developing a North campus near Mount Clef. He also brought the university's first football coach, Robert Shoup, to the campus in 1962. Shoup used an orange orchard for football practice and used the local high school stadium for home games for the first two seasons. He won 13 NAIA District 3 Championships in 17 years. The Kingsmen appeared in the playoffs five times, winning the NAIA National Championship in 1971. He was named NAIA Coach of the Year in 1971.</p>
<p>In 2010, California Lutheran University was ranked 18th among Regional Universities in the West by U.S. News and World Report. </p>
<p>Chris Kimball, Ph.D., became the seventh President of California Lutheran University in April 2008 and was officially inaugurated into that position on April 26, 2009. Dr. Kimball became President after serving as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>

<h4>Senate</h4>
<p>The ASCLU Senate is primarily responsible for the financial needs of the students. Some of their duties include (but are not limited to): approving and allocating funds to new campus clubs, purchasing equipment for residence halls, and discussing and/or changing campus dining policies. The Senate is usually divided into three or four committees, headed by a committee chair (who has usually served on Senate for one or more years), and each has a specific jurisdiction regarding campus policies. </p>
<h4>Programs Board</h4>
<p>The ASCLU-G Programs Board is primarily responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and running many of the on- and off-campus events that go on throughout each academic year. The principle event that Programs Board is responsible for is known as Club Lu, a free event for traditional undergraduate students every Friday night. Each Club Lu is different; in the past, some Club Lu events have included rollerskating, on-campus dances, iceskating, bowling, movie nights, the Homecoming carnival, Christmas festivals, and talent shows. Programs Board is also responsible for planning larger off-campus events such as the Homecoming Dance and Spring Formal. Like Senate, Programs Board is divided into three or four committees, each headed by a committee chair (who has usually served on Programs Board for one or more years), and each is assigned specific events to plan throughout the academic year.</p>

<p>Recognizing her contributions to international business and philanthropic work, Maria Lee received a Doctor of Law degree from California Lutheran University, and Katie Yang, for her work as a businesswoman, artist, actress, and eminent performances in Chinese opera as well as film, received a Doctor in Humane Letters from the university.</p>
<p>The Kwan Fong Gallery inaugurated its role in providing a venue for art in the <a>Conejo Valley</a> by an exhibit of the paintings of the sisters, as well as resplendent costumes worn by Ms. Yang on stage.</p>
<p>Since its establishment the gallery has become an important center for art in <a>Ventura County</a>, exhibiting works by <a>Cyn McCurry</a>, Gary Palmer, Christophe Cassidy, Morgan Alexander, Christopher Marshall and many others. Recently the gallery has seen residencies by artists become part of its programming, the first in 2007 by Dallas / Fort Worth based figurative painter Cyn McCurry.</p>
