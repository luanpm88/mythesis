<p> The <strong>University of Redlands</strong> is a private liberal arts and sciences university located in <a>Redlands, California</a>. The university's campus sits on 160 acres (0.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) near downtown Redlands. The university was founded in 1907 and was associated with the <a>American Baptist Church</a>. The land for the university was donated by church member Karl C. Wells. The university maintained its religious orientation and required chapel attendance of all students until 1972. The university is now an independent institution but maintains an informal relationship with the <a>American Baptist Churches USA</a>.</p>
<h2>History of the University of Redlands</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|Administration building.</a></p>
<h3>Founding the University</h3>
<p>The University of Redlands had its roots in the founding of two other <a>American Baptist</a> institutions, <a>California College</a> in Oakland, and Los Angeles University. After the <a>San Francisco earthquake of 1906</a> damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in <a>Southern California</a>. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field, a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least 100,000 dollars and  for an interdenominational campus (on land donated by layman Mr. K.C. Wells). On June 27, 1907 the Commission voted all in favor of the Redlands proposal.</p>
<p>Ground was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the newly completed Administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion were the only two other buildings completed. President Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for <a>endowment</a>, but the <a>Great Freeze of 1911</a>, which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible.</p>
<p>President Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke, Dean and Professor of Mathematics, became the next president. The Southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment.  <a>thumb|left|The Quad with the Memorial Chapel in the distance.</a></p>
<p>By 1925 the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, UR was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, memorial chapel and gymnasium were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the university. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2,592,000, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.</p>
<h3>Redlands during the Great Depression</h3>
<p>By the beginning of 1932, the effects of the <a>Great Depression</a> started to be felt at the University. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the University owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, the day after the governor declared a moratorium on banks, President Duke died of a <a>cerebral hemorrhage</a>.</p>
<p>The administration of UR's third President, Dr. Clarence Howe Thurber, soon ran afoul of <a>ultra-conservative</a> churches. Student members complained of a <a>liberal</a> attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of Dr. William H. Roberts, a Redlands psychology professor who became the campaign manager of <a>Upton Sinclair</a>'s run for governor in 1934, also severely strained <a>town and gown</a> relations.</p>
<h3>Redlands during and after World War II</h3>
<p>The 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands. They began with the bombing of <a>Pearl Harbor</a>. As conscriptions and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and <a>March Field</a>.</p>
<p>The July 1, 1943 arrival of a <a>Navy V-12</a> unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands&#x2019; largest enrollment ever, and gradually lead to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the Trustees finally discarded the &#x201c;no dancing&#x201d; policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.</p>
<p>The passage of the <a>GI Bill</a> further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veteran's families were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June, 1949, 126 were veterans, and of these 70 were married. </p>
<p>The 50s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the University was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hummex, in Philosophy. </p>
<p>Compulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 70s.  The seventh President of the University, Dr. Douglas Moore, was not even Baptist. The campus became truly interdenominational and multicultural, going for some years without clergymen on the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Following Dr. Moore, Dr. James R. Appleton served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987-2005. Under his leadership, the University of Redlands saw significant enhancements in campus facilities and technology; strong enrollments; balanced budgets and record-breaking private fund raising. </p>
<p>Dr. Stuart Dorsey served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005-10.  During this period, the University opened the  Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library adding five computer labs and a caf&#x00e9;. Dr. Dorsey resigned his position on March 16, 2010 amid controversy over budget deficits and proposed cuts. </p>
<p>On March 17, 2010, current Chancellor and former president Dr. James R. Appleton was appointed interim president.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Armacost Library</a> Students at the university study in one of five schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, the School of Business, the School of Music, or the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies.</p>
<h3>College of Arts and Sciences</h3>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences serves approximately 2,407 students from 43 states and 10 foreign countries. About 24 percent are Asian, Latino, African American, Native American or multi-ethnic students.</p>
<p>The college has 167 full-time faculty members. Eighty-five percent of full-time faculty have a Ph.D. or terminal degree.</p>
<h4>Johnston Center for Integrative Studies</h4>
<p> Born in the midst of the Experiential Education Movement, Johnston College, an endowed college which was to become the first cluster college at the University of Redlands.  It began as an experiment in professor-student mentor relationships where a student-initiated, contract-driven education, and operated as an autonomous unit of the university for approximately 10 years. The first class of approximately 30 students, graduated in 1972.  The structure of the educational system was based on seminars (8-10 students), tutorials (3-8), and independent studies.  </p>
<p>In 1979, it was integrated into the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) as the Johnston Center for Individualized Studies. It operated under that name until the mid-1990s, when it was renamed The Johnston Center for Integrative Studies.</p>
<p>Today, some two-hundred Redlands students live and learn together in the Johnston complex, which includes two residence halls and five faculty offices. Students design their own majors in consultation with faculty, and write contracts for their courses, for which they receive narrative evaluations in lieu of traditional grades.</p>
<h4>School of Music</h4>
<p>The University of Redlands School of Music was founded along with the University as its School of Fine Arts. It is today an accredited institutional member of the <a>National Association of Schools of Music</a>, and its requirements for entrance and graduation comply with the standards of this accrediting organization.</p>
<p>Approximately 185 students study Music with 13 full-time and 26 adjunct faculty.</p>
<p>Any University student may participate in musical activities through enrollment (usually by audition) in the University Choir, Chapel Singers, Madrigals, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Studio Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, University Opera, and a variety of chamber music ensembles. Students are invited to register for private, group, or class lessons, available on all instruments and for voice.</p>
<p>Renowned concert organist <a>Frederick Swann</a> is professor of organ.</p>
<h3>School of Education</h3>
<p>The oldest graduate division within the university, the School of Education was founded in 1924. As of 2006, it serves 584 students in graduate coursework, with 17 full-time professors and 30 adjunct professors, and offers a nationally unique &quot;Doctorate in Leadership for Educational Justice&quot; (Ed.D.), the only doctoral program on campus, which engages 20 students each year.</p>
<p>Geared primarily for the working professional, the school partners with the College of Arts and Sciences to offer undergraduates a chance to earn their teaching credential. The school currently offers students the chance to obtain their Preliminary Teaching Credential, as well as Administrative and Pupil Personnel Services Credentials. It also offers Masters of Arts Degrees in School Counseling, Curriculum and Instruction, Educational Administration and higher Education.</p>
<p>In 2001 the School of Education partnered with the Lewis Center for Educational Research in Apple Valley. They offer Preliminary Teaching Credentials and Master of Arts in Education programs onsite and serve Apple Valley and the surrounding high desert communities.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2008, the University of Redlands, School of Education expanded to a second satellite campus in Orange County. Working with the University of Redlands, School of Business, the School of Education offers Multiple and Single Subject Teacher Credential Programs and an Education Masters degree in Counseling. Credential courses are held twice a week and Masters level courses are held one to three nights a week.</p>
<h3>School of Business</h3>
<p>Founded in 1976 as the Alfred North Whitehead College for Lifelong Learning, the School of Business started as an experiment in providing educational services to working adults in locations throughout Southern California. It was one of the first successful ventures in quality education through <a>off-site learning</a>. It evolved to become the School of Business in 2001.</p>
<p>The School of Business currently has 1,019 full-time students (2006), taught by 22 full-time and 46 adjunct professors. Classes are held at the Redlands campus as well as satellite locations in <a>Burbank</a>, <a>Orange County</a>, <a>Rancho Cucamonga</a>/<a>Ontario</a>, <a>Riverside</a>, <a>Temecula</a>, <a>Torrance</a>,  and <a>San Diego</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Business also offers a daytime MBA program, which was launched in 2006. The program provides an opportunity for a Redlands graduate to stay a fifth year and complete a masters. Some aptly prepared students could even complete the program in as little as 30 units. According to Keith Roberts, associate dean, &quot;The school of business has traditionally only taught working adults in an evening program, but we saw there was a need for traditional students who completed their bachelor's to move right into a graduate program so this was a new market that our school of business had never really addressed.&quot; &#x00e1;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Redlands competes in the <a>Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (SCIAC), which operates within NCAA Division III.  Redlands was one of the founding members of the SCIAC in 1915 and is one of only two schools to have had continuous membership.  The university currently fields ten men&#x2019;s teams and eleven women&#x2019;s teams.</p>
<p>The team mascot is the bulldog.  The university has traditionally maintained a live bulldog in this capacity.  The current mascot is Duke, who has held the title since 2003.  He is commonly seen at sporting events or around campus.</p>
<h2>Campus housing</h2>
<p>The University offers its students guaranteed housing during their four years of undergraduate study. Many dorms are &quot;themed&quot;, with themes such as &quot;freshman&quot;, &quot;social justice&quot;, &quot;substance-free&quot;, etc.  These themes and configurations change from time to time.  </p>
<p>Students must live on campus unless there is parental consent and a compelling reason until the age of 23.  </p>
<p>The majority of students live in double-occupancy rooms with semi-private hallway bathrooms located around the Quad.  Most rooms offer a sink and some dorms offer open, gym-style open showering facilities.  There are a few semi-private showers that are gender neutral, primarily in the Holt building of the Johnston complex. </p>
<p>Air conditioning is not standard in many dorms.  Where air conditioning is provided, the thermostat is usually controlled centrally, outside of the dorms, and may only be available 2&#x2013;6 hours per day, depending on the dorm.  It can be very hot at the beginning and end of the academic year.  During the winter, heat is provided in all dorms but, again, may be subject to limited hours of operation, leading, in some dorms, to very cold nights and mornings.  </p>
<p>Students live in the following halls and complexes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anderson Hall: The largest Residence Hall on campus, Anderson houses approximately 200 undergraduates primarily in first or second years. The rooms are in a suite-style layout, with two double-occupancy or triple-occupancy rooms sharing a single bathroom. Air conditioning is only provided in the lobby, leading to uncomfortably warm rooms in the late spring and early fall. Anderson is known for its very social community as well as its music-themed hallway on the first floor.</li>
  <li>Bekins Hall: One of the two &quot;Johnston Complex&quot; housing and classroom buildings, Bekins has the distinction of being the first residence hall on campus. Non air-conditioned and does not meet current earthquake standards. Contains a cafe.</li>
  <li>Bekins-Holt: Johnston Complex's other building includes the Johnston lobby and is air conditioned during certain hours of the day.  Contains a basement cafe.</li>
  <li>Brockton Avenue Apartments: The newest housing at the University, the Brockton Apartments opened for the 2003-2004 academic year. The complex houses approximately 250 residents in four-person units. These units share two bathrooms and a common area/kitchen. Brockton is viewed as the best place for upperclassmen to live, however it comes at a higher cost than the halls.</li>
  <li>California-Founders Hall: Consists of an all male wing (California) and an all female wing (Founders) joined by a common lobby to form a living area for approximately 200 sophomore and junior students. This hall underwent major renovation in the summer of 2006 to outfit the hall with modern fire equipment, as well as electrical upgrades, structural bolstering, and air conditioning. The hall reopened September 1, 2006 for staff, hosting residents the next day.</li>
  <li>Cortner Hall: Home to 130 residents, usually in the upper classes of juniors and seniors. The hall was renovated in 2000 and is viewed by many to be the epitome of upperclass housing within the hall system.</li>
  <li>East Hall: Originally built for the Johnston Complex, East hosts approximately 120 freshmen in its three air conditioned, quadrangle-layout floors.</li>
  <li>Fairmont Hall: The campus' smallest dorm, Fairmont hosts 60 residents who come together with an interest in Social Justice. It houses a combination of two first-year seminars and upperclass students with an interest in social justice.  Fairmont is the only hall with its own mascot: a rock, deemed such a prize for its theft and relocation over the years that Fairmont residents anchored it to the ground in concrete in 1976. To this day, various other halls attack the rock in a friendly water-balloon battle late at night.</li>
  <li>Grossmont Hall: Home to approximately 120 women, Grossmont is the largest unisex hall on campus. The financier specified that the hall were to be for the use of women exclusively for the duration of its lifetime; thus it stands today. Non air-conditioned.</li>
  <li>Merriam Hall: The school's dedicated &quot;green hall&quot;, Merriam houses a combination of first-year seminars and upperclass students interested in environmental sustainability.  Merriam has air-conditioned rooms and features energy-efficient lighting, low-flow plumbing fixtures, and furniture made from recycled materials.  Gym-style open showers.</li>
  <li>Melrose Hall: The &quot;quiet&quot; hall, which houses 65 students, features extended quiet hours, from 9pm to 9am daily. It is often referred to as &quot;Hotel Melrose&quot; by students due its large rooms, new facilities, and overall tranquility and cleanliness. </li>
  <li>North Hall: Merriam's twin hall, North is the Wellness Hall, featuring substance-free living, and a primary pick for athletes due to its proximity to the athletic facilities.  Gym-style open showers.</li>
  <li>Williams Hall: East's twin hall, Williams hosts approximately 120 freshmen in its three partially air conditioned, quadrangle-layout floors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New units</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Lewis Hall</a> The University has recently added two new buildings: Lewis Hall (named after U.S. Congressman <a>Jerry Lewis</a>) and Appleton hall (named after the former university president). Lewis hall opened in fall of 2005, and is home to the Master of Science in Geographic Information Systems Program, the Environmental Studies Program, and the Redlands Institute (an environmental research institute). Appleton Hall opened in spring 2006 and is home to the physics, math, and computer science departments, which were previously in Duke and Hentschke halls.  Appleton Hall, named after UR chancellor and former president Jim Appleton, cost the university about $10.3 million. Its southern wall is graced by a giant <a>sundial</a> designed by physics professor Tyler Nordgren, including a version for daylight-saving time, that is accurate within 10 minutes. The occupants of the second building call it &quot;Hall of Numbers.&quot;</p>
<h3>Alternative living</h3>
<p>The University also offers alternative housing to various organizations. Merit houses, such as the Billings and Harrison Houses are awarded to organizations for use in the school year. The university also offers a <a>Greek System</a>, unaffiliated with national Greek organizations, which also contains several houses for residence by the groups' members. The houses that compile the group of Greek housing are usually located on Frat Row which is located behind the school softball field, all with the exception of the Sigma Kappa Alpha and Chi Rho Psi house.</p>
