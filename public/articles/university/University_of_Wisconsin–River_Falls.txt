<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Wisconsin&#x2013;River Falls was founded in 1874 as River Falls State Normal School, which was renamed River Falls State Teachers College in 1927. From 1951 to 1964, the school was called Wisconsin State College&#x2013;River Falls. In 1964, it became Wisconsin State University&#x2013;River Falls. The school became a member of the <a>University of Wisconsin System</a> and was renamed University of Wisconsin&#x2013;River Falls in 1971, when the former University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin State Universities merged.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>In the past few years, UWRF has updated many of its aging buildings. North Hall, which, prior to the construction of the Ames Teacher Education building, housed the Campus School, is now an administration building. The university opened a new <a>student union</a> called University Center in January 2007 to replace the Hagestad Student Center (renamed to Hagestad Hall). A day care center (The CHILD Center) was constructed and dedicated in 2004. In 2005, the university opened a suite-style residence hall named George R. Field South Fork Suites, serving 240 students.  A new locker room addition for the Hunt-Knowles Complex opened in 2005, serving the college athletic department and the <a>Kansas City Chiefs</a> during their summer training camp. In October 2007, the Dairy Learning Center complex was dedicated at the Mann Valley campus laboratory farm. The complex contains nine buildings that include classrooms, labs, a milking parlor, herd weighing and tracking systems, and an ecologically friendly animal waste disposal system.  A new wing of South Fork Suites containing an additional 240 beds is currently in the planning phase.  </p>
