<p> <strong>Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</strong> (), formerly known as <strong>&#x5317;&#x4eac;&#x5de5;&#x4e1a;&#x5b66;&#x9662;</strong>, is a leading <a>public</a>, <a>co-educational</a>, <a>national key university</a>, located in <a>Beijing</a>, <a>China</a>. Established in 1940 in <a>Yan'an</a> (&#x5ef6;&#x5b89;), the university used to be administered by the <a>Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense</a> (COSTIND). After COSTIND was merged into the newly established <a>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> (MIIT) in 2008, the university is now under the direct administration of the MIIT.</p>
<p>BIT has been a tier-1 research university in China for more than 50 years. It is one of the first Chinese universities to run a graduate school and received privileged fund from the Chinese government in &#x201c;the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Five Year Plan.&#x201d;  BIT is also one of the national &#x201c;<a>Project 211</a>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<a>Project 985</a>&#x201d; universities, which were given priority for development by the Chinese government, the <a>Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense</a>, the <a>Ministry of Education (MOST)</a> and the Beijing Municipal Government. </p>
<p>BIT's strategic collaborators include eleven Chinese provinces and <a>direct-controlled municipality</a>, as well as forty city or county level governments. The university also has various cooperations with ninety higher education institutions in 29 countries, as well as over one hundred major domestic and international corporate enterprises.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history (1940-1952)</h3>
<p>BIT it is the first science and <a>engineering</a> university founded by the <a>Chinese Communist Party</a>. The predecessor of BIT is the Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences, which was founded in January 1940. In 1943, the Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences was merged into the Yan'a University as the Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences (&#x5ef6;&#x5b89;&#x5927;&#x5b78;&#x81ea;&#x7136;&#x79d1;&#x5b78;&#x9662;). In January 1946 and January 1947, the academy merged with the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Industrial Vocational School (&#x6649;&#x5bdf;&#x5180;&#x908a;&#x5340;&#x5de5;&#x696d;&#x5c08;&#x9580;&#x5b78;&#x6821;), and the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei border Industrial Traffic College (&#x6649;&#x5bdf;&#x5180;&#x908a;&#x5340;&#x5de5;&#x696d;&#x4ea4;&#x901a;&#x5b78;&#x9662;), respectively. In 1948, the academy became part of the North China University as the School of Engineering.  Several science and engineering departments of the Sino-French University (&#x4e2d;&#x6cd5;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) were merged into the school in 1950. </p>
<p>In 1951, the school was separated from the North China University. However, according to the discipline adjustments policy of the Chinese government, some departments were terminated and transferred to other universities. For example, the Biology Department was transferred to the <a>China Agricultural University</a>. Part of the Aerospace Science Department was transferred to support the newly founded <a>Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>.</p>
<p>In 1952, the school was renamed as the Beijing Institute of Technology.</p>
<h3>Milestone events after 1952</h3>
<p>In 1959, BIT was designated by the Chinese government as one of the 16 national key universities, which were authorized to offer graduate degrees. In 1978, BIT was still designated as one of the 88 national key universities by the Chinese government, despite that most research was stopped during the <a>Cultural Revolution</a> from 1966 to 1976.</p>
<p>In 1984, BIT was chosen as one of the 25 national key universities to receive special supports from the Chinese government during the <a>Seventh Five-Year Plan</a>. In the same year, BIT was authorized as one of the first 22 Chinese universities to run graduate schools on trial. In 1988, the institution changed its Chinese name from &quot;Institute&quot; to &quot;University&quot;, while the English name remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In 1991, BIT was chosen as one of the 14 national key universities to receive special supports from the Chinese government during the <a>Eighth Five-Year Plan</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1995, BIT was ratified by the Chinese government as one of the 15 first-tier &quot;<a>Project 211</a>&quot; universities. </p>
<p>In 1996, BIT became one of the first 32 Chinese universities to officially run graduate schools. In the same year, BIT was designated as one of the 27 national key universities during the <a>Ninth Five-Year Plan</a>. In 1999, BIT's undergraduate education was evaluated as &quot;Excellent&quot; in the assessment organized by the <a>Chinese Ministry of Education</a>.</p>
<p>In 2000, BIT was the 10th university to be admitted into &quot;<a>Project 985</a>&quot;, which gave prioritized supports to selected universities to develop into top domestic universities with international fame. In the same year, BIT was also designated as one of the top 22 universities in the &quot;21st Century Education Promotion&quot; plan during the <a>Tenth Five-Year Plan</a>.</p>

However, some of its research are not allowed to be disclosed and a great amount of the research work cannot be published.</p>
<p>BIT's traditional research strength lies in <a>Electrical Engineering</a> (now with the Chinese name of <a>Information Engineering</a>), <a>Automation</a>, <a>Photonics</a>, <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>, <a>Vehicle Engineering</a>, <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> and <a>Chemical Engineering</a>.

<p>BIT has five national key laboratories (research centers), six national defense key laboratories (research centers), two <a>MOST</a> key laboratories (research centers) and four Beijing municipal key laboratories (research centers). It also has a national key <a>science park</a>. The annual research expenditure in 2004 was more than 620 million <a>RMB</a>.</p>
<h3>Rankings and controversies</h3>
<p> Historically, BIT was widely considered by Chinese education officials among top 20 universities in China. In recent national level evaluations, BIT was among the first 15 universities to be designated into the &quot;<a>Project 211</a>&quot;. It is also the 10th university to be designated into the prestigious &quot;<a>Project 985</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>According to the <a>China Discipline Ranking</a> conducted by the a research center affiliated with the China Ministry of Education, BIT ranks among top 10 nationally in the following ten disciplines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weaponry Science and Technology: ranked 1st.</li>
  <li>Information Engineering: ranked 5th.</li>
  <li>Optical Engineering: ranked 5th.</li>
  <li>Aerospace Science and Engineering: ranked 5th.</li>
  <li>Mechanical Engineering: ranked 7th.</li>
  <li><a>Metallurgical Engineering</a>: ranked 7th.</li>
  <li>Transportation and Traffic Engineering: ranked 9th.</li>
  <li>Instrument Sciences and Technology: ranked 10th.</li>
  <li>Automation Science and Engineering: ranked 10th.</li>
  <li>Chemical Engineering: ranked 10th.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to the ranking's classification of academic disciplines, BIT was evaluated in about 30 disciplines.</p>
<p>However, the rankings of BIT provided by non-governmental parties are slightly different. According to the controversial <a>Wu Shulian</a>'s Chinese University Ranking provided by independent researcher <a>Wu Shulian</a>, BIT ranked 37th in 2005, 35th in 2006, 33rd in 2007 and 31st in 2008, among all Chinese universities.</p>
<p>A lot of BIT alumni argued that such rankings provided by non-governmental parties tend to undervalue BIT, because a lot of research conducted at BIT are classified. Therefore, BIT has various limitations in publicizing its faculty members and research achievements. In addition, independent ranking researchers also have limited access to BIT's data.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>Established in 1940, the BIT library now consists of one main library and four branch libraries. Nine new branch libraries are in construction or planning. </p>
<p>The renovation of the main library was completed in 2006. The state-of-the-art building has an area of 25,509 square meters and is covered by wireless network. It now has a total collection of more than 3 million items, including 1.13 million electronic items .</p>
<h3>Press</h3>
