<p><strong>Anglia Ruskin University</strong> is a <a>university</a> in <a>England</a>, with campuses in <a>Cambridge</a> and <a>Chelmsford</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anglia Ruskin University has its origins in the <strong>Cambridge School of Art</strong> opened in 1858 by <a>John Ruskin</a>. In 1960 this became the <strong>Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology</strong> (CCAT). In 1989 CCAT merged with the <strong>Essex Institute of Higher Education</strong> to form the <strong>Anglia Higher Education College</strong>.  The merged college became a <a>polytechnic</a> in 1991, using the name <strong>Anglia Polytechnic</strong>, and was then awarded university status in 1992.</p>
<p>Initially <strong>Anglia Polytechnic University</strong> (APU), it retained the word 'polytechnic' in its title because &quot;the term 'polytechnic' still had value to students and their potential employers, symbolising as it did the sort of education that they were known for &#x2013; equipping students with effective practical skills for the world of work&quot; although in 2000 there was some self-doubt about including the term 'polytechnic' &#x2014; it was the last university in the country to have done so. Wanting to keep the 'APU' abbreviation, a suggestion put forward by the governors was 'Anglia Prior University' (after a former Chancellor), but the Governors decided to keep 'polytechnic' in the title.</p>
<p>The University eventually reconsidered a name change, because &quot;Nowadays, few remember the old polytechnics and technical colleges, and there was no longer any value to students or faculty in retaining the word 'polytechnic' in the title. Indeed, it was sometimes seen as a hindrance, especially in non-vocational subject areas.&quot; Author <a>Tom Sharpe</a> was a lecturer in History at CCAT between 1963 and 1972 and <a>Anne Campbell</a>, the Labour MP for Cambridge from 1992 to 2005, was formerly a lecturer in Statistics at CCAT.</p>

<p>There are five Faculties of study at Anglia Ruskin University:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashcroft International Business School</li>
  <li>Faculty of Arts, Law &amp; Social Sciences</li>
  <li>Faculty of Education</li>
  <li>Faculty of Health &amp; Social Care</li>
  <li>Faculty of Science &amp; Technology</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculties are sub-divided into departments or divisions.</p>
<p>HSHS, the former Homerton School of Health Studies, was acquired by the University from the Trustees of <a>Homerton College</a> in 2005, after working closely in partnership for a number of years. The two organisations have now integrated to form the Faculty of Health &amp; Social Care.</p>
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<p>Anglia Ruskin's Cambridge Campus is home to one of only 5 <a>optometry</a> schools in England (of only 8 in the whole of the UK) having its own optometry clinic offering free <a>eye tests</a> and a full range of optometric services to members of the public throughout the academic year.itself</p>
<p>The Cambridge campus is currently undergoing extensive redevelopment, which began with the refurbishment of Helmore, the main building on East Road, completed in 2006. In 2009, one of the University's largest buildings, Rackham, in the centre of the campus, was demolished to make way for the new Ashcroft International Business School (AIBS) which is rivalled only by the University of Cambridge itself, demonstrating Anglian Ruskin Cambridge Campus's all round academic reputation and prestige.</p>
<h3>Ruskin Gallery</h3>
<p>The Ruskin Gallery is the University's public art gallery.  Admission is free.  Exhibits have included historic and contemporary art, as well as works by students and staff.  The gallery is surrounded by fine art, illustration, design, and media studios.</p>
<h2>Profile and reputation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Anglia Ruskin University's Helmore Building, East Road, Cambridge.</a></p>
<p>Anglia Ruskin University is one of the largest universities in the East of England, and one of the largest providers of face-to-face part-time training in the country.</p>
<p>In the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE) 2008, 31% of Anglia Ruskin's submissions were rated as Internationally Excellent (3*) or World-Leading (4*), resulting in 86&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; place in the THES rankings, a 35 position improvement over 2001. Among the academic disciplines now rated World-Leading are Allied Health Professions &amp; Studies; Art &amp; Design; English Language &amp; Literature; Geography &amp; Environmental Studies; History; Music; Psychology; and Social Work &amp; Social Policy &amp; Administration.</p>
<p>Anglia Ruskin University was shortlisted for the Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiative Award at the <em><a>Times</a></em> Higher Education Awards 2008.</p>
<p>In July 2010, Anglia Ruskin University was rated 10th in the &quot;Green League&quot; of British universities, compiled by <a>People and Planet</a>. The league is based on nine environmental criteria, both policy and performance related. It incorporates data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, including the percentage of waste recycled and <a>CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</a> emissions for each individual institution.</p>
<p>Anglia Ruskin University is ranked as the 2272nd best university in the world  just ahead of <a>Hanoi University of Technology</a>. Its low position is the result, to a great extent, of its poor performance in the annual National Students Survey.</p>
<p>A recent investigation performed at the end of 2007 by the <a>QAA</a> reveal that as a result of its investigations, the audit team's view of Anglia Ruskin University is that <em>confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the institution's present and likely future management of the academic standards of the awards that it offers and the quality of the learning opportunities available to students</em>.. However, an external inspection of the Education faculty revealed inadequacies in 2010. The areas highlighted were the effectiveness of the provision in securing high quality outcomes for trainees, and the extent to which the training and assessment ensures that all trainees progress to fulfil their potential given their ability and starting points. </p>
