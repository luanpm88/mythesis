<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1908 as a <a>women's college</a>, university was established by the <a>Virginia General Assembly</a>. It was originally called <em>The State Normal and Industrial School for Women</em> at Harrisonburg. In 1914, the name of the university was changed to the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. At first, academic offerings included only today's equivalent of technical training or junior college courses, however authorization to award bachelor's degrees was granted in 1916. During this initial period of development, the campus plan was established and six buildings were constructed.</p>
<p>The university became the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1924 and continued under that name until 1938, when it was named Madison College in honor of the fourth president of the United States. In 1976 the university's name was changed to James Madison University. Additionally in June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing the former Harrisonburg High School building from Harrisonburg City. In May 2006 the university offered to purchase the property. The sale was approved in June 2005 for $17 million. The university named the old HHS building as Memorial Hall.  Recently completed projects include a second library located on the east side of campus. East Campus Library (ECL), opened on August 11, 2008, just before students returned for the fall semester.  The  Forbes Center was opened in June 2010, it will be the new home to JMU's School of Theatre and Dance and provides performance venues and support spaces for the School of Music.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left|Newman Lake</a> The campus of JMU originally consisted of two buildings, known today as Jackson and Maury Halls. The early campus design was modeled after that of <a>Union College</a>, thus resembling the ideal city of Renaissance. Today, the campus of James Madison University has 111 major buildings on . The campus is divided into five parts: Bluestone, Hillside, Lakeside, Skyline, and the Village. The Skyline area is located on the east side of <a>Interstate 81</a>, while the Bluestone, Hillside, Lakeside, and Village areas of the campus are located on the west side. The two sides of campus are connected both by a bridge and a tunnel underneath the highway (Duke Dog Alley). Other unique features on the campus include Newman Lake, a  pond located in the Lake Area next to Greek Row and Sonner Hall, the Edith J. Carrier Arboretum, and one set of railroad tracks passing directly through the campus.</p>
<p>The original portion of campus is situated on South Main Street and has, since the late 1990s, expanded east across the <a>Interstate 81</a>. The expansion included the addition of The College of <a>Integrated Science and Technology</a> (CISAT), the University Recreation Center (UREC), the Festival Conference and Student Center, the Leeolou Alumni Center, several residence halls, the Chemistry and Physics Building, which houses the chemistry department as well as the department of Physics and Astronomy, and athletic fields. The East Campus Library, completed in the August of 2008, is one of the most recently added building to the east side of JMU's campus. </p>
<p>Several new construction projects on the campus of James Madison University have been included in Governor Tim Kaine's $1.65 billion higher education bond package. Governor Kaine's proposal designates more than $96 million for JMU projects. Among the projects included in the proposal are the construction of a new biotechnology building, Centennial Hall ($44.8 million) and the renovation and expansion of Duke Hall ($43.4 million). The proposal also includes $8.6 million as the final installment payment for Rockingham Memorial Hospital. The university received state and private funding to construct a state of the art Performing Arts Complex, The Forbes Center, near the quad in 2007. The Forbes Center, built at a cost of $82 million, opened in June 2010 to house performing arts programs  </p>
<p>Bus service around campus and the city is provided by the <a>Harrisonburg Department of Public Transportation</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Students on the James Madison University quad</a></p>
<p>The <a>Princeton Review</a> also recognized James Madison as one of 81 schools in America &quot;with a conscience&quot;, and in the latest year ranked behind only the <a>University of Virginia</a> in the number of <a>Peace Corps</a> volunteers it sent from its student body among &quot;medium-sized&quot; universities. In 2009, <a>Playboy</a> ranked JMU as the 22nd Best Party School in the nation.  These rankings take into consideration the surrounding area's activities, academics, as well as the social scene on campus.</p>
<p>The school has 35 residence halls, nine of which serve as sorority houses. While most residence halls are only for housing, several halls are used for multiple purposes. For example, Chandler Hall, located in the Lake area, has a basement dining facility and a computer lab, in addition to upperclass housing. As freshmen must live on campus, a large portion of JMU's housing availability is set aside for incoming students. Consequently, most upperclassmen and graduate students live off campus; those who wish to live on campus must apply for housing each year. While occasional exceptions are granted, generally freshmen are not granted parking permits. JMU's Greek life makes up roughly 12% of the student body.</p>

<h3>Board of Visitors</h3>
<p>Like all public universities in Virginia, James Madison is governed by a Board of Visitors, mostly appointed by the Governor of Virginia. In addition to the 15 members appointed by the governor, the speaker of the Faculty Senate and an elected student representative serve as representatives for the faculty and the student body respectively. The appointed members serve for a maximum of two consecutive 4 year terms, while the student representative is limited to two one-year terms. The faculty representative serves for as long as he or she remains the speaker of the JMU Faculty Senate.</p>
<h4>Past presidents</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a>Julian Ashby Burruss</a> (1908&#x2013;1919)</li>
  <li>Dr. <a>Samuel Page Duke</a> (1919&#x2013;1949)</li>
  <li>Dr. <a>G. Tyler Miller</a> (1949&#x2013;1971)</li>
  <li>Dr. <a>Ronald E. Carrier</a> (1971&#x2013;1998)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community relations</h2>
<p>The University's rapid expansion has created tension in the city-university relationship with issues such as growth planning. In 2006, the Board of Visitors approved the invocation of eminent domain against a neighboring business, a funeral parlor, to make way for the school's new Performing Arts Center.  Before eminent domain was exercised, the property owner chose to accept a purchase offer from the University. In the May 2006 city election, incumbent mayor Larry Rogers, who also serves on JMU's Board of Visitors, lost his bid for reelection to a JMU graduate. JMU has nearly doubled in size in the last 20 years. JMU purchased the former Harrisonburg High School building, now known as Memorial Hall, and promised to keep some of the important features intact for the benefit of the community.</p>
<h3>Association with local riots</h3>
<p><a>Riots</a> have broken out twice within the student housing area of Harrisonburg during large events involving <a>alcohol</a>.</p>
<p>A riot took place in August 2000, when about 2,500 students clashed with police at a <a>block party</a> at the Forest Hills <a>townhouse</a> complex on Village Lane.</p>
<p>On April 10, 2010, during the <a>annual</a> (non-university sanctioned) Springfest <a>Block Party</a>, a group of 8,000 college-aged individuals were gathered in the townhouse development on Village Lane, just off campus.  JMU sent out an <a>emergency mass text message</a> warning students to &quot;disperse from social events in that area immediately for safety reasons.&quot;  Police also reportedly relayed the message via loudspeaker, and thousands heeded the warning.  A riot developed when fire was set to dumpsters and some people threw beer bottles at police officers.  It was unclear whether JMU students or non-JMU students were responsible for the initiation of the riot and ignition of the fires. Moments later, Harrisonburg Police and <a>Virginia State Police</a> in <a>riot gear</a> moved into the crowd, launching <a>tear gas</a> grenades and shooting <a>rubber bullets</a> at the crowd.  The crowd moved to another <a>apartment</a> complex and riot police followed.  They released tear gas on the crowd once again. <a>Police helicopters</a> circled the city with spotlights for much of the night, trying to locate any other unlawful gatherings. Between 30 and 35 people were arrested, both JMU and non-JMU students, and over fifty people were injured by flying glass bottles and went to the hospital for treatment.  Countless others were injured by the effects of the tear gas.  Several injuries were severe enough to warrant the need for patients to be airlifted to the <a>University of Virginia</a> Medical Center in <a>Charlottesville</a>.   </p>
<p>In a statement to students, JMU President <a>Linwood H. Rose</a> condemned the behavior of Springfest attendees while recognizing the influx of students from neighboring universities, and noted the effect of the weekend's events on the university's reputation.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|Duke Dog Athletics Identity.</a> James Madison University's athletic teams use the name &quot;Dukes&quot; in competition, with the <a>Duke Dog</a>, a gray bulldog dressed in a purple cape and crown, as the school's mascot. &quot;Dukes&quot; is in honor of Samuel Page Duke, the university's second president. Madison competes in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> (<a>Football Championship Subdivision</a> for football), the Colonial Athletic Association, and the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a>. The Dukes played football in the Atlantic 10 Football Conference until it disbanded after the 2006 season and currently play in the Colonial Athletic Association, which picked up the Atlantic 10's football operations beginning fall 2007 Students compete in football, basketball, soccer, women's swimming, diving, women's volleyball, baseball, women's lacrosse, field hockey, golf, cross country, track and field, and softball. James Madison's two national championships ranks them tied for third most national titles in Virginia. James Madison's baseball team advanced to the 1983 <a>College World Series</a>, the only Division I institution in Virginia to do so besides the University of Virginia in 2009. The JMU women's field hockey gave the university their first national title in 1994. JMU football also won the <a>NCAA Division I-AA</a> national title in 2004, with a 13-2 record, and are the only team in history to win the title after playing four straight road playoff games. Since then they have appeared in the playoffs in 2006, 2007 and 2008, losing in the semi-finals after being ranked #1 in Division I-AA most of the season. In 2006, considerable controversy arose after the decision to cut 10 varsity teams (including both men's and women's teams) was deemed necessary by the Board of Visitors to comply with <a>Title IX</a> restrictions.</p>
<p>Most recently, James Madison University has used funds to create a new baseball and softball field complex by Memorial Hall.  Additionally, after the last football game of 2009, the university began an expansion of Bridgeforth Stadium that will increase the amount of seating by 10,000. Construction on the stadium is expected to be finished in time for the Dukes to start their 2011 football season.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2010, the JMU Dukes Football team beat the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) #13 ranked <a>Virginia Tech Hokies</a> 21-16 at <a>Lane Stadium</a> in front of over 66,000 fans in one of the biggest upsets in college football history.</p>
