<p> <strong>Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science</strong>, () (also referred to as <strong>BITS Pilani</strong>) is a private technical university  located in <a>Pilani</a>, <a>Rajasthan</a>, <a>India</a>. BITS also has campuses in <a>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</a>, <a>Goa</a>, India, <a>Hyderabad</a>, India and an extension center in <a>Bangalore</a>, India</p>
<p>The University has developed and administers the all-India computerized entrance test BITSAT (BITS Admission Test), which is the first of its kind in India. Students are granted admission solely on the basis of merit (as assessed by the BITSAT Examination) and not through any kind of reservations. The institute is privately supported and fully residential. It is the first Indian institution to set up a campus outside <a>India</a>.</p>
<p>The University has strong linkages with Industry, as can be seen by its off-campus Work Integrated Learning Program(WILP) which enrolled 19,000 students from diverse corporate enterprises in 2009. Also, it is known to be one of the first (and only) Indian engineering universities to require compulsory industry internship of its on-campus students through its &quot;Practice School&quot; program.</p>
<p>It should not be confused with the <a>Birla Institute of Technology</a>, a completely unrelated Institute which is located in <a>Ranchi</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>The institute was founded by Dr. <a>Ghanshyam Das Birla</a> in 1929 as an intermediate college.</p>
<p>During <a>World War II</a>, the Government of India established a technical training center at Pilani to train technicians for defence services and industry. In 1946, it was converted into the Birla Engineering College with degree programmes in electrical and mechanical engineering. The college was set up with very limited infrastructure. Prof. V Lakshminarayan became Vice Principal of Birla College of Engineering in 1946. The Masters programme in Electronics began in 1955.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the first <a>Indian Institute of Technology</a>'s (IITs) were being set up. It was then that <a>Ghanshyam Das Birla</a> decided that  Therefore, in 1964, the Birla Colleges of Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Pharmacy and Science were merged to form the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) with Dr. G.D. Birla as the founder chairman.</p>
<p>It was largely as a result of Dr. Birla's perseverance and contacts that in this period, (especially during 1964&#x2013;1970) BITS Pilani received support from the <a>Ford Foundation</a>. The Ford Foundation also supported an alliance between BITS and <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (During 1964-1970), during which the faculty at BITS were sent abroad to receive training at MIT  The faculty members at MIT also helped to reshape the curriculum at BITS by introducing the semester system, continuous evaluation and world-class textbooks for the courses.</p>
<p>To hasten the pace of reforms, the Ford Foundation and its MIT advisers convinced Birla to hire Prof . C. R. Mitra, former head of <a>Harcourt Butler Technological Institute</a>, as the new Director of the Institute. It was  Mitra who pushed for a &quot;practice school&quot; internship program far more ambitious than anything MIT had done, as a requirement for all faculty and students. This Practice School Program is now a part of all BITS campuses.</p>
<p>According to Robert Kargon and Stuart Leslie: </p>
<p>BITS Pilani became a Deemed University established vide Sec. 3 of the UGC Act, 1956 under notification No. F.12-23/63.U-2 of June 18, 1964.</p>
<h3>Expansion into Multiple Campuses</h3>
<p>    </p>
<p>BITS Pilani has undergone a gradual and planned expansion since 1999, both in India and abroad, to help meet the demand for engineers. In 1999, student capacity was expanded from 2500 to 4000 The BITS Pilani <a>Hyderabad, India</a> campus started functioning in 2008. BITS also runs a virtual university and an extension center in <a>Bangalore</a>.</p>
<h3>Chancellor and Academic Head</h3>
<p></p>
<p>BITS Pilani has a tradition of long-serving Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors. Its founder Mr. G.D. Birla was the Chancellor from the college's inception until his demise in 1983. He was followed by his son Dr. <a>Krishna Kumar Birla</a>, who was the Chancellor until his death in 2008. Currently <a>Kumar Mangalam Birla</a> is the Chancellor and Shobhana Bhartia is the Pro-Chancellor. The first academic head of the institution was Dr. V. Lakshminarayanan, who served in this capacity from 1946 to 1969. He was succeed by BITS Directors C.R. Mitra (1969&#x2013;1989) and S. Venkateswaran (1989&#x2013;2006). With the opening of multiple campuses, the overall head came to be known as 'Vice Chancellor', while 'Director' denoted the head of a campus. L.K. Maheshwari became the first Vice Chancellor in 2006, while Bijendra Nath Jain is the current Vice Chancellor and fifth academic head of the institute since its inception.</p>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<h3>Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad Campuses</h3>
<p>Since 2005, admission to BITS campuses have been offered to students based on their performance in an all-India Entrance Examination, called BITS Admission Test BITSAT. The test, exclusive to the BITS Pilani University, is conducted online and held in May and June in many cities all over India. Toppers of higher secondary examinations of each single board are exempted from taking BITSAT test and are considered for direct admission. BITSAT differs from the conventional written examination as it is an online exam held at more than 20 places all over India. Acceptance rate in BITS is very low, less than 2.08% in 2007, making it one of the most selective in India. The admission is purely on the basis of merit and not through any kind of reservation.</p>
<h3>Dubai Campus</h3>
<p>Admission to <a>Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science, Pilani - Dubai</a> is based entirely on the marks secured on the 12th standard qualifying exam and no other entrance test.
