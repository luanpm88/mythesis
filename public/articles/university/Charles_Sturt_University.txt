<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|CD Blake Auditorium, Bathurst campus, CSU</a> The University was established on 1 July 1989 from the merger of several existing separately-administered <a>Colleges of Advanced Education</a> including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga and the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga, through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989). It is named in honour of explorer <a>Charles Sturt</a>.</p>
<p>The Mitchell College of Advanced Education had been formed on 1 January 1971, and the Riverina-Murray Institute in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1985. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College. </p>
<p>In 1998, CSU established the first Study Centre in Sydney  and then in Melbourne  in 2007. These study centres are operated by a private education group called Study Group Australia </p>
<p>On 1 January 2005, CSU formalised moves to assume control of the <a>University of Sydney</a>'s <a>Orange</a> campus, which came into force on 1 January 2005. From that date, all new Orange campus students were eligible to qualify for degrees from CSU; continuing students continued to be awarded their degrees from Sydney.</p>
<p>On 10 July 2007, fire destroyed a chemistry laboratory at the University's Wagga Wagga campus </p>
<p>In 2008 CSU opened a new Veterinary Clinical Centre on Wagga Wagga Campus and 2011 sees the opening of a publicly available Dental and Oral Health Clinic.</p>

<p>Initially, CSU was one of a handful of Australian universities not to increase tuition fees by 25%, one of the reforms introduced by federal education minister <a>Brendan Nelson</a> in 2004, but it later voted to increase fees by the full 25% allowable starting from 2006.</p>
<p>On its Bathurst campus, CSU operates a radio station, <a>2MCE</a>, which also acts as the originating studio for <em><a>National Radio News</a></em>, a popular community radio news service.</p>
