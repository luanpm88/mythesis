<h2>Athletics and mascots</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Hofstra Pride logo</a></p>
<p>Hofstra University teams had the unofficial <a>nickname</a> of the <a>Flying Dutchmen</a> (or <em>Dutchmen</em> or just <em>Dutch</em>). The school's official team name became &quot;The Pride&quot; in 2004, referring to a pair of <a>lion</a>s which became the school's athletic <a>mascot</a>s in the late 1980s. The Pride nickname evolved from the Hofstra Pride on-and off-campus image campaign that began in 1987, during the university's dramatic recovery and growth. This followed a financial crisis in the 1970s that forced the layoff of more than 100 employees. The school's revival was credited in large part to the man who led the University from 1976 to 2001&#x2014;educator, government official and former Hofstra football star Dr. James M. Shuart. <a>Hofstra Stadium</a>, the school's main outdoor athletic facility, has been named James M. Shuart Stadium since 2002.</p>
<p>Prior to 2008, the <a>New York Jets</a> held summer training camp at their on-campus headquarters before moving to their new headquarters in <a>Florham Park, New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2009, the university announced it was terminating the football program. Under NCAA rules, any football players who choose to transfer to other schools will be eligible to play immediately, and not subjected to normal residency waiting periods. Scholarship-holders who wished to stay at Hofstra were permitted to keep their scholarships.</p>
<h2>Medical School</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, October 16, 2007 Hofstra University and <a>North Shore-LIJ Health System</a> announced plans to establish a new school of <a>medicine</a>. While it will not be the first medical school in <a>Nassau County</a> (that distinction is held by the <a>New York College of Osteopathic Medicine</a>), it will be the first to grant the <a>Doctor of Medicine</a> (M.D.) degree. They are now accepting applications for their first class.</p>

<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p>The University has had a long history of Greek-Lettered organizations dating back to its founding. Many local chapters that began with the University are maintained to this day, such as Phi Epsilon and Alpha Theta Beta (AOB). In the early 1990s, as Hofstra began to grow so did its social organizations. Many national chartered chapters were founded in 1989. One of the local chapters, the Wreath and Foil Sorority, founded in 1937, became Phi Sigma Sigma. One of the more notable changes in the 1990s was the removal of many local chapters and growth of nationally chartered fraternities, such as Zeta Beta Tau, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Kappa Sigma, and a business fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi (1989). Tau Epsilon Phi and Tau Kappa Epsilon are the oldest fraternities on campus, both arriving in 1969.  The Sigma Delta Tau Sorority claims to be one of the oldest nationally recognized sororities on campus. </p>
<p>Hofstra, as a University that promotes diversity, has also adopted in its Interfraternity-Sorority Council several ethnic organizations. Many national black and Latino organizations also surged in development in the 1990s and as a result have a large presence on the campus. Several are currently inactive. Overall Greek Lettered organizations contribute to much of the philanthropy on campus, well as much of the school spirit. During events like Homecoming parades, students and alumni notice a majority of Greek Lettered floats. And the Sinterklaas celebration, a fifteen year-old tradition of a holiday village built and constructed annually by members of the Greek lettered community for local children to play in and around during the December holiday season. One of its largest events, Greek Week held in the Spring semester, is a week long series of events of competition. Mainly sports, well as toga skits, banner competitions, a can castle, for local homeless shelters, and a relay race the community generates a lot of attention. The Greek-Lettered community is often noted for maintaining many traditions, and loyalty towards their alma mater. In addition, is noted for creating much of the social life on and off campus.</p>
<p>Since 2001, when the newest President of the University took office three additional social organizations have colonized and chartered chapters on campus: the Delta Chi Fraternity, the Delta Gamma Fraternity, and the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity applied successfully for colonization in the Spring 2010 semester. The Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity applied successfully for re-colonization in the Spring 2010 Semester. As of August 2010, no new organizations are pending. Only two social organizations, the Sigma Sigma Sigma Sorority and the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity, remain inactive.</p>
