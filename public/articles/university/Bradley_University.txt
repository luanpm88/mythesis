<p><strong>Bradley University</strong> is a private, <a>co-educational</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Peoria, Illinois</a>. It is a medium-sized institution with an enrollment of approximately 6,100 undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|left|Bradley Hall is one of the first buildings constructed for the university and bears the name of the university's founder.</a> The Bradley Polytechnic Institute was founded by <a>philanthropist</a> <a>Lydia Moss Bradley</a> in 1897 in memory of her husband Tobias and their six children, all of whom died early and suddenly, making Bradley a childless widow. The Bradleys had discussed establishing an orphanage in memory of their deceased children. After some study and travel to various institutions, Mrs. Bradley decided instead to found a school where young people could learn how to do practical things to prepare them for living in the modern world. As a first step toward her goal, in 1892 she purchased a controlling interest in Parsons Horological School in LaPorte, Indiana, the first school for watchmakers in America, and moved it to Peoria. She specified in her will that the school should be expanded after her death to include a classical education as well as industrial arts and home economics: &quot;...it being the first object of this Institution to furnish its students with the means of living an independent, industrious and useful life by the aid of a practical knowledge of the useful arts and sciences.&quot;</p>
<p>In October 1896 Mrs. Bradley was introduced to Dr. William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago. He soon convinced her to move ahead with her plans and establish the school during her lifetime. Bradley Polytechnic Institute was chartered on November 13, 1896. Mrs. Bradley provided  of land, $170,000 for buildings, equipment, and a library, and $30,000 per year for operating expenses.</p>
<p>Contracts for Bradley Hall and Horology Hall (now Westlake) were awarded in April and work moved ahead quickly. Fourteen faculty and 150 students began classes in Bradley Hall on October 4&#x2014;with 500 workers still hammering away. (The Horological Department added another eight faculty and 70 students.) Bradley Polytechnic Institute was formally dedicated on October 8, 1897. Its first graduate, in June 1898, was Cora Unland.</p>
<p>Originally, the institute was organized as a four-year <a>academy</a> as well as a two-year college. There was only one other <a>high school</a> in the city of Peoria at the time. By 1899 the institute had expanded to accommodate nearly 500 pupils, and study fields included <a>biology</a>, <a>chemistry</a>, food work, <a>sewing</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>German</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>Latin</a>, <a>Greek</a>, <a>history</a>, manual arts, drawing, <a>mathematics</a>, and <a>physics</a>. By 1920 the institute dropped the academy orientation and adopted a four-year collegial program. Enrollment continued to grow over the coming decades and the name <em>Bradley University</em> was adopted in 1946.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300pix|right|Seen here from bottom left to bottom right are Wyckoff, Heitz, and Elmwood Halls, with Harper and Geisert (also from left to right) dominating the background.</a></p>
<p>Bradley's  campus is located on Peoria's west bluff and is minutes from the city's downtown. The campus of Bradley University is relatively compact. There are few places on campus which cannot be reached from any other part of campus in under ten minutes on foot. Bradley's student housing is concentrated on the campus's east side, and the residence halls include: College (all women's), Geisert, Harper, Heitz, University, Williams, and Wyckoff Halls. There is also a complex of singles dormitories and two university-owned apartment complexes: St. James Apartments and the Student Apartment Complex.</p>
<p>Also located on the south side of Bradley's campus is Dingeldine Music Center, which was acquired from the Second <a>Church of Christ, Scientist</a> in 1983. The Center serves as the main performance and practice facility for Bradley's instrumental and choral programs. <a>thumb|300pix|right|The Dingeldine Music Center</a> Bradley University is also the site of Peoria's <a>National Public Radio</a> affiliate, <a>WCBU-FM</a>, located on the second floor of Jobst Hall.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|The athletic emblem of the Bradley University Braves.</a>Bradley University is a member of the <a>Missouri Valley Conference</a>. Conference-approved sports at Bradley for men are baseball, basketball, cross country running, golf, soccer, and tennis. Women's' sports consist of basketball, cross country running, golf, indoor and outdoor track, softball, tennis, and volleyball. The men's basketball team has appeared eight times in the NCAA Tournament: 1950, 1954, 1955, 1980, 1986, 1988, 1996, and 2006. In <a>1950</a> and <a>1954</a> they were national runners up in the <a>Final Four</a>, and in 2006 the Braves made their first <a>Sweet Sixteen</a> appearance since 1955, defeating 4th seed Kansas and 5th seed Pittsburgh. However, Bradley's run came to an end in the <a>Sweet Sixteen</a> with a loss to the <a>University of Memphis</a>. Bradley also won the <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> in 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1982.  In 2008, the men's basketball team was selected to participate in the inaugural <a>College Basketball Invitational</a>. They reached the Championship game but lost to <a>Tulsa 2-1 in a 3 game series</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Bradley soccer team lost in the MVC Championship.  In 2007, the Bradley soccer team returned to the MVC Championship and defeated Creighton 1-0 to claim their first MVC Tournament Championship and fourth appearance in the NCAA postseason soccer tournament. They had never won a game in the NCAA tournament. Following their first ever NCAA tournament game victory over DePaul 2-0, the Braves continued on a magical run to the Elite Eight by defeating seven-time national champion Indiana University on penalty kicks (5-4)and the University of Maryland in overtime, both on the road.  During the Maryland game they were down 2-0 with less than 3 minutes left and won. The match has been referred to as &quot;The Miracle in Maryland.&quot;  Bradley&#x2019;s coach, Jim DeRose, was named the national Coach of the Year by Soccer America after their great season.</p>
<p>The university does not have a <a>football</a> team.  The football program was disbanded in 1970.</p>
<p>Bradley University was a member of the <a>Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1910-1937.</p>
<p><strong>Bowl games</strong> </p>
<h3>Controversy</h3>
<p>The school's teams are named the &quot;Braves&quot;, originally in reference to the <a>Peoria</a> tribe from which the city takes its name.</p>
<p>In August 2005, the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>, which conducts collegiate athletics, instituted a ban on schools that use &quot;hostile and abusive&quot; American Indian nicknames from hosting postseason games, beginning February 2006. Bradley was initially placed on a list of schools with such names. In April 2006, after a lengthy and contentious appeals process by Bradley officials, the NCAA agreed to remove Bradley from the list but placed it on a 5-year watch list. </p>
<h2>Groups and activities</h2>

Bradley's forensics team hosts the nation's oldest intercollegiate competition, known as the L.E. Norton Invitational.  The tournament is named after former forensics director L.E. Norton.  The team also hosts an annual tournament for high school speech teams, known as the George Armstrong Invitational.</p>
<p>In April 2010 Bradley's Speech Team regained the American Forensics Association title in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, winning the title after a decade long dry spell. Three senior students set a new record by taking the top three spots in individual sweepstakes.</p>

<h3>Broadside</h3>
<p>The annual student literary journal, <em>Broadside</em>, publishes student art and writing in a 100-page journal that is released each spring.  The publication is staffed and run entirely by students.

<h3>The Scout</h3>
<p>The student-run weekly newspaper, <em>The Scout</em>, covers student life and issues on campus, Bradley sports, and local Peoria news that concerns students.

<h3>Project Springboard</h3>
<p>Project Springboard is an annual business plan competition started in 2007 to complement Bradley's Entrepreneurship major.

Project Springboard's inaugural winner, iRepair Squad, announced in February 2008 that their sales had topped $1 million.  The competition was brought to Bradley by Peoria businessman <a>Alexis Khazzam</a>, owner of <a>Junction Ventures</a>, who donated $200,000 to the university to fund the competition.</p>
