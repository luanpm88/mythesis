<p><strong>Osgoode Hall Law School</strong> of <a>York University</a> is a Canadian <a>law school</a>, located in <a>Toronto</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>. Named after the first <a>Chief Justice of Ontario</a>, <a>William Osgoode</a>, the law school was established by <a>The Law Society of Upper Canada</a> in 1889 and was the only <a>accredited</a> law school in <a>Ontario</a> until 1957. The school was at the centre of the debates over the principles of modern legal education in the 1950s. Osgoode Hall Law School provided many of the founding members of the bar in the <a>prairie provinces</a>. Today, the law school offers a professional degree in law that is accepted for bar admission in every province with the exception of Quebec, as well as <a>Massachusetts</a> and <a>New York</a>, three joint degree programs, as well as Canada's largest graduate program in law. It also offers a United States JD degree in conjunction with <a>New York University School of Law</a>. Osgoode Hall Law School has adopted the Juris Doctor degree designation which has replaced their previous <a>Bachelor of Laws</a> designation. <a>thumb|left|The current building which houses the law school, occasionally called &quot;New Osgoode Hall&quot;.</a> The law school is home to the <a>Law Reform Commission of Ontario</a>, the <a>Osgoode Hall Law Journal</a>, and the largest law library in the <a>Commonwealth</a>. The law school houses a <a>student clinic</a> (<a>the Community and Legal Aid Services Programme</a>), the Innocence Project, and according to the Official Guide to Canadian Law Schools, the most extensive range of clinical programs in Canada. The primary student government at Osgoode is the <a>Legal and Literary Society</a>.</p>
<p>Osgoode Hall Law School is particularly known for its leading role in the areas of constitutional law, the Charter and human rights, and international law. (<a>Peter Hogg</a>, <a>Brian Slattery</a>, <a>Patrick J. Monahan</a>, <a>Jean-Gabriel Castel</a>)</p>
<p>Some of the world's most important legal scholars teach at Osgoode, including <a>Leslie Green</a> who holds the <a>University of Oxford</a>'s statutory Chair in <a>Philosophy of Law</a>. Former <a>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> and former judge at the <a>Supreme Court of Canada</a>, <a>Louise Arbour</a> taught at, and later became the associate dean of, Osgoode Hall Law School.</p>
<p>Other world-class leading scholars at Osgoode include <em><a>Alan Hutchinson</a></em> (Torts, Public law, Legal Theory), <em>Robert S Wai</em> (International Trade Regulation), <em>Benjamin Geva</em> (Commercial and Banking Law), <em>Ian MacDougal</em> (Corporate Governance, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions), <em>Jinyan Li</em> (International Taxation Law), <em>Kent McNeil</em> (Native Law), <em>Eric Tucker</em> (Labour Law), <em><a>Mary Jane Mossman</a></em> (Feminist Legal Theory, Family Law, Law Reform), <em>Gary D Watson</em> (Civil Litigation), <em>Stepan Wood</em> and <em>Benjamin Richardson</em> (Environmental Law), <em><a>Brian Slattery</a></em> (Constitutional Law).</p>
<p>The current dean of the law school is <a>Lorne Sossin</a>. He succeeds <a>Patrick J. Monahan</a>.  Monahan, in turn, succeeded <a>Peter Hogg</a> who is a leading Canadian constitutional expert and the author of <em>Constitutional Law of Canada</em>, the single most-cited book in decisions of the <a>Supreme Court of Canada</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The first year class of Osgoode Hall Law School in 1944</a> For its first seven decades, Osgoode Hall Law School was located at <a>Osgoode Hall</a> at the corner of Queen Street and <a>University Avenue</a> near the <a>University of Toronto</a>. The law school was not affiliated with the University of Toronto since <a>law schools</a> at that time traditionally were not connected with a university. The <a>Law Society of Upper Canada</a> maintained control of professional legal education in <a>Ontario</a> until 1957. In 1969, after a decision by the Ontario Ministry of Education requiring <a>law schools</a> to be affiliated with a <a>university</a>, the Osgoode Hall Law School relocated to New Osgoode Hall, on the campus of <a>York University</a>. </p>
<p>The structures at Queen and University (the earliest dating from 1832) are still known as <a>Osgoode Hall</a>, but are commonly referred to as &quot;Old Osgoode Hall&quot;.  They remain the headquarters of the Law Society of Upper Canada and house the <a>Court of Appeal for Ontario</a>. </p>
<p>The law school is responsible for numerous firsts in legal education in Canada. Osgoode was the first law school to introduce curricular streams in 2001, giving a student the opportunity to graduate with a concentration in a particular area of law, namely <a>International</a>, <a>Litigation</a> or <a>Tax</a>. Osgoode was the first law school to establish a combined law and business degree. Osgoode was the first law school to establish a combined law and environmental studies degree. Osgoode was the first law school to establish a student-staffed community legal services clinic (Parkdale Community Legal Services, in 1972). Osgoode was the first law school to develop innovative intensive programs and clinical teaching programs. In 2007 Osgoode's Intensive Program in Aboriginal Lands, Resources and Governance won the <a>Canadian Bureau for International Education</a> (CBIE) Award for &quot;Outstanding Program&quot; in recognition of &quot;high quality&quot; of education.

<h2>Renovation project</h2>
<p>[[Image:Osgoode Library Stacks 2007.jpg|thumb|Osgoode Hall Law School has the largest law library in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].]] In May 2007, Dean Monahan announced plans for an extensive renovation and extension of Osgoode Hall Law School's current premises. The project involves a renovation of the existing building, and addition of an additional wing.</p>
<p>Construction of the renovated building began in the summer of 2009.  When completed the new building, designed by architect <a>Jack Diamond</a>, will introduce natural light to classrooms, lecture theatres, and social spaces.  It will showcase classroom windows and a multi-story atrium that will serve as the living room or common area for the law school, uniting student space, faculty offices and the library.  The library will be revamped to emphasize comfortable work-spaces, while maintaining its extensive holdings.  Staircases will be removed to provide more &quot;universal&quot; accessibility, and student spaces, such as the cafeteria and student-run &quot;Junior Common Room&quot; will be thoroughly upgraded and relocated to prominent areas within the facility.  </p>
<p>The new wing of New Osgoode Hall be named the &quot;Ignat Kaneff Building&quot;, in recognition of a $2.5 million dollar contribution to the Building Osgoode Campaign by businessman and developer Ignat Kanneff.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>In 2007, teams from Osgoode Hall Law School won several major mooting competitions in Canada. During this same year they went on to win the Sopinka Cup, to be honored by the American Trial Lawyer's Association for their excellence, and to win all three of the 1st prizes at the US Mediation Tournament.</p>
<h3>Clinical Programs</h3>
<p>Osgoode is well known for the breadth of its <a>clinical programs</a>, which include well known clinics such as the Innocence Project and the Community and Legal Aid Services Programme (CLASP). Other clinics include the Osgoode Business Clinic, the Advanced Business Clinic, the Aboriginal clinic, the Poverty Law clinic at Parkdale, and several more.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>Osgoode Hall has recently altered its admissions process to a more <a>holistic</a> system, similar to that employed at <a>McGill University Faculty of Law</a>. Holistic admissions processes take into account both Undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores, as well as &quot;other relevant criteria&quot; such as graduate degrees, work experience, and difficulty of prior academic studies. The median undergraduate GPA of accepted students is 3.67 (about 80%), and the median LSAT score is 162 (85th percentile). While it is possible to be admitted with only three years of undergraduate university study, in practice the majority of successful candidates arrive to first year law at Osgoode already possessing one or more degrees.<a>http://www.lsac.org/jd/Choose/Canadian/York.asp</a></pre>
<h3>Joint degrees</h3>
<p>Osgoode Hall Law School offers a joint <a>M.B.A.</a>/<a>J.D.</a>. program with the <a>Schulich School of Business</a> at <a>York University</a>, and a combined <a>J.D.</a> and Master of Environmental Studies degree.</p>
<p>Osgoode Hall Law School also offers the Osgoode/NYU Juris Doctor program with <a>New York University School of Law</a>.  Both schools offer joint-degree programs where students can earn an American J.D. (<a>ABA</a>-Approved) and Canadian LL.B. in four years, spending two years at each institution.  Osgoode and NYU have also recently introduced an Osgoode J.D./NYU <a>LL.M.</a> program, whereby a student can obtain both degrees in just three and a half years instead of the four years it would normally take.</p>
<p>Osgoode is also one of the few law schools to offer the possibility of graduating with both an English Canadian LL.B. and a Quebec <a>LL.L.</a> degree, enabling graduates to practice in the province of Quebec and providing graduates of this program with training in the Civil Law System in addition to common law. This program is offered in conjunction with the law school at the <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al</a>.</p>
<h3>Academic Graduate programs</h3>
<p>Osgoode is home to the largest academic <a>Graduate Program</a> in Law in Canada. Osgoode also hosts the only Professional Development Program in Canada, whose courses are taught at the satellite campus located at the Osgoode Professional Development Centre at 1 Dundas Street West in downtown Toronto. A variety of <a>LL.M.</a> and academic Ph.D. degrees in law are available.</p>
