<p><strong>Cairo University</strong> (, previously <em>Egyptian University</em> and later <em>Fuad University</em>) is an institute of <a>higher education</a> located in <a>Giza</a>, <a>Egypt</a>. Cairo University includes a <a>School of Law</a> and a <a>School of Medicine</a>. The <a>Medical School</a>, also known as <em><a>Kasr Alaini</a></em> (, Qasr-el-'Ayni), was one of the first medical schools in Africa and the Middle East. Its first building was donated by <a>Alaini Pasha</a>. It has since undergone extensive expansion. The first president of Cairo University, then known as the Egyptian University, was Professor <a>Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was founded on December 21, 1908, as the result of an effort to establish a national center for educational thought.  Several constituent colleges preceded the establishment of the university including the College of Engineering () in 1816, which was shut down by <a>Muhammad Said Pasha</a> in 1854.  Cairo University was founded as a European-inspired civil university, in contrast to the religious university of <a>al-Azhar</a>, and became the prime indigenous model for other state universities in the region.</p>
<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>On March 31, 1914; <a>Husayn Kamil</a>, minister of Justice and the University Rector was speaking at the university's ground ceremony for a new building, he said: &quot;On the eastern side of Cairo, al-Azhar has stood for nearly a 1000 years. It has been a lofty beacon sending light all directions and immortalizing the sciences of the Arabs and the civilization of Islam. Now here is the new university which will be built in the age on the western side of the city to spread Arabic sciences together with Western learning. These twin brothers will cooperate henceforth in enlightening both banks of the blessed Nile, from the right and from the left, in the things which will restore the people of the valley to complete well-being and full glory&quot;.</p>
<h2>The Egyptian University</h2>
<p>As a major offshoot of the national Egyptian movement that goes back to the beginning of the century, a number of national leaders, enlightenment pioneers and social thinkers called for the establishment of an Egyptian university. In the beginning of this century, social thinkers like <a>Muhammad Abduh</a>, <a>Mustafa Kamil</a>, Mohammed Farid, <a>Qasim Amin</a> and <a>Saad Zaghloul</a> called for the establishment of an Egyptian University to be a lighthouse of liberal thought and the basis of a comprehensive academic revival in all  fields of knowledge in order to be able to cope with the international scientific and academic advancement.</p>
<h2>Origin of the university idea</h2>
<p><a>150px||thumb|right|Saad Zaghloul</a> At least five different parties; claim to have planted the seed of the Egyptian University. Royalists; <a>Prince Ahmad Fuad</a>. Nationalists with Watanist affinities pressed Mustafa Kamil's claims, Umma Party and the Wafd; which have emphasized the contributions of <a>Saad Zaghlul</a>, <a>Qasim Amine</a>, and <a>Muhammad Abduh</a>. But early suggestions came from the Armenian bureaucrat Yaqub Artin and the Syrian journalist <a>Jurji Zaydan</a>. In 1894 <a>Yaqub Artin</a>; suggested that the existing higher professional school could well provide the basis for a university. Jurji Zaydan had two models in his mind for the new university.</p>
<p>In 1900 al-Hilal; called for an &quot;Egyptian College School&quot; to provide home-grown modern higher education in Arabic, so that Egyptians would not have to go to Europe. The other model was the Syrian Protestant College which American missionaries had founded in Beirut.</p>
<p>In 1908, Mustafa Kamil and Qasim Amin died, and Khedive Abbas took the project of the university under his wing naming his son Crown Prince Abd al-Munim as honorary head. Then he considered four other princes: <a>Husayn Kamil</a>, Umar Tusun, Muhammed Ali, and Ahmed Fuad; or the actual leadership of the university. Only Fuad was both willing to serve and acceptable to the British. He was named for the post late in 1907. Abbas assigned the university E5,000 annually from the Awqaf Department which, unlike the rest of the state budget, was still under his personal control.</p>
<h2>New Central Library</h2>
<p><strong>First: Motives and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Within the framework of the policy of developing and modernizing Cairo University in an attempt to equip it with all features of the twenty first century, including Information and Communication Revolution, Cairo University Administration has prioritized the issue of developing and modernizing the Central Library.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1994 , and on the occasion of renovating Ahmed Lotfi Al Sayed Hall, at the University Administration, First Lady, Suzanne Mubarak, who conceded to attend the inauguration of this hall drew attention to the renovation and modernization of the university library. She, likewise, promised to muster all potentials to make this project materialize.</p>
<p>In a response to this grand directive, President of Cairo University, Prof. Dr. Mufid Shehab issued a decree to form a highly specialized committee, comprising all experts in the field. This committee was headed by Cairo University Vice President for Higher Studies Prof. Dr. Farouk Ismail.</p>
<p>Considering the status quo of Cairo University Central Library, established in 1932, it is clear that the library has duly performed its assigned role. However, the new developments in the world of information and libraries; the emergence of new scientific specializations; the increasing number of students; and the establishment of new faculties have made it necessary for the comprehensive development of the library.</p>
<p>The current Central Library of Cairo University is composed of two floors as well as the ground floor, which consists of three levels. The ground floor includes the technical processes room (indices &#x2013; classification &#x2013; provision &#x2013; periodicals); photocopying and binding room; and researchers room. The first floor includes: halls of manuscripts, oriental studies, foreign studies, indices, checking out, computer, and stores of Arabic and foreign books.</p>
<p>Second floor includes halls for references and the blind; university theses; and rooms of library administration.</p>
<p>Information forms and media available now at the Central Library include printed materials; books; periodicals; references; university theses; manuscripts and rare books; audio materials in halls for the blind; microfilming and microfiching.</p>
<p>The higher committee assigned with studying the New Central Library Project held meetings over the last two years. It studied the status quo of the Central Library and came up with the fact that renovating and modernizing the present library is not practical. The committee also drew attention to the significance of establishing a new central library to meet future requirements.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there was an agreement after the meetings held by university president, university vice presidents, university secretary &#x2013; general to establish a new central library, through which the university invades the coming century. The current headquarters of the Central Library will be modernized and allocated as a specialized library for Faculty of Arts. The Council of Cairo University agreed on 31/7/1996 to establish a new central library and take the required measures.</p>
<p>Prof. Dr. Ali Raafat, Professor of Architect, Faculty of Engineering prepared a blueprint of the new central library under the supervision of Professor Dr. Farouk Ismail, Cairo University Vice President for Higher Studies and Research Affairs and Head of the two committees on establishments and university libraries.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Mufid Shehab, Cairo University President, a comprehensive study of the proposed new Cairo University Central Library was made.</p>
<p>Following are the objectives of establishing a new Cairo University Central Library:</p>
<p>1-     Providing undergraduates with developed library service.</p>
<p>2-     Meeting the needs of higher studies and scientific research in terms of books, periodicals and new sources of information.</p>
<p>3-     Meeting the needs of common readers and researchers who do not belong to the university.</p>
<p>4-     Integrating the varied libraries of faculties and the university library.</p>
<p>5-     Linking the Central Library with great libraries and world specialized information centers.</p>
<p>6-     Integrating the New Central Library with the new and developed great libraries in Egypt .</p>
<p>7-     Linking Cairo University with world movement of scientific research and higher studies by exploiting information and communication technology to connect the new library with varied world information institutions, such as libraries and international and regional information centers, networks and banks.</p>
