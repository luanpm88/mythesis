<h2>History</h2>
<p>Acadia Divinity College was established in 1968 after the Board of Governors of Acadia University voted to reduce the role of the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches in the governance of the university, thus effectively making Acadia a secular school.  The establishment of Acadia Divinity College was one of the concessions the Board of Governors made to the Convention.</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>ADC offers the <a>Master of Divinity</a> (MDiv) with majors in Pastoral Office, and <a>Youth Ministry</a>, Master of Arts (Theology) (MA(Th)) in <a>Biblical Studies</a>, <a>Church History</a>, and <a>Theology</a>, and the <a>Doctor of Ministry</a> degree. The <a>Bachelor of Theology</a> is a degree for students 35 and older who have the approval of their denomination to pursue that degree for ordination.
