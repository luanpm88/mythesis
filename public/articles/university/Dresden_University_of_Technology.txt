<p>The <strong><em>Technische Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden</em></strong> (usually translated from <a>German</a> as <strong>Dresden University of Technology</strong> and abbreviated <strong>TU Dresden</strong> or <strong>TUD</strong>) is the largest institute of higher education in the city of <a>Dresden</a>, the largest university in <a>Saxony</a> and one of the 10 largest universities in <a>Germany</a> with 34,993 students . The name Technische Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden has only been used since 1961; the history of the university, however, goes back nearly 200 years to 1828. This makes it one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany, and one of the country&#x2019;s oldest universities, which in German today refers to institutes of higher education which cover the entire curriculum. The university is member of <a>TU 9</a>, a consortium of the nine leading German Institutes of Technology.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1828, with emerging <a>industrialization</a>, the &quot;Saxon Technical School&quot; was founded to educate skilled workers in technological subjects such as <a>mechanics</a>, <a>mechanical engineering</a> and ship construction. In 1871, the year the <a>German Empire</a> was founded, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon <a>Polytechnic</a> (<em>K&#x00f6;niglich-S&#x00e4;chsisches Polytechnikum</em>). At that time, subjects not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all disciplines. In 1961 it was then given its present name, the Dresden University of Technology (<em>Technische Universit&#x00e4;t Dresden</em>).</p>

<p>Upon <a>German reunification</a> in 1990, the university had already integrated the College of Forestry (Forstliche Hochschule) in the nearby small town of <a>Tharandt</a>. This was followed by the integration of the Dresden College of Engineering (Ingenieurshochschule Dresden), the <a>Friedrich List</a> College of Transport (Hochschule f&#x00fc;r Verkehrswesen) the faculty of transport science, and the &#x201c;Carl-Gustav Carus&#x201d; Medical Academy (Medizinische Akademie or MedAk for short), the medical faculty. Some faculties were newly founded: the faculties of <a>Information Technology</a> (1991), <a>Law</a> (1991), <a>Education</a> (1993) and <a>Economics</a> (1993). <img></p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>With regard to its ability to generate research money from industry partners, the TU Dresden belongs to the most successful in <a>Germany</a>. In 2004 3,564 projects were financed with 104.1 million Euro from outside sources (other than state funds). The TU Dresden benefits from the strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, but also from the establishment of new research fields such as Biotechnology.</p>
<p>The <em><a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a></em> supports the university in many areas and TU Dresden cooperates closely with renowned research institutes such as <a>Fraunhofer Society</a>, <em><a>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community</a></em> and <a>Max Planck Society</a>.</p>
<h3>Biotechnology and Medical Technology</h3>
<p>The university has established a strong partnership with the <em><a>Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics</a></em> in molecular bioengineering. As part of the <a>German Universities Excellence Initiative</a>, the <a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> has decided to fund a Cluster of Excellence &quot;From Cells to Tissues to Therapies: Engineering the Cellular Basis of Regeneration&quot; <a>(DFG-Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden)</a>, the  as well as a new graduate school, the &quot;<a>Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering</a>&quot; with about 300 PhD students.</p>
<h3>Magnetism and Material Sciences</h3>
<p>The <em><a>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a></em> funds research in the area of electromagnetic flow influence in metallurgy, artificial crystal formation and electrochemistry. Other research is done on the <a>Meissner effect</a> and artificial fibers (textile).</p>
<h3>Micro and Nanotechnology</h3>
<p>Since the early 1990s, the <a>Dresden</a> area has developed into a so called <em>Silicon Saxony</em> and the TU Dresden is incorporated in this network with three departments of the Faculties of Electrical Engineering and Sciences. Together with the <em>Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies</em> (CNT), which is also in Dresden, it is one of the leading universities in the field of nanotechnology. There is also a research cooperation with the semiconductor company <a>Qimonda</a>.</p>
<h3>Other research areas</h3>
<p>The university has a partnership with the <em>Fraunhofer-Institut for Transport and Infrastructure systems</em> to research on IT-systems for public transport in Dresden.</p>
<p>In partnership with TU Dresden, the <em>Ifo Institute of Economic Research (Ifo Institut f&#x00fc;r Wirtschaftsforschung e.V.)</em> is researching the economic development in Eastern Germany.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The main auditorium</a> The university offers a comprehensive spectrum of courses and research. It has a high reputation in technical fields such as <a>electrical engineering</a>, <a>computer science</a>, photo optics, engine construction and traffic logistics.</p>
<p>In university rankings, particularly in the German professional magazine &#x201c;Wirtschaftswoche&#x201d; (Economics Weekly), the best ranked courses are usually <a>engineering</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>psychology</a> as well as <a>Business Administration</a> and <a>economics</a>. Special attention and praise is given to the field of international relations, with the university offering the only undergraduate studies in <a>international relations</a> in Germany, accession to which is restricted by comprehensive admission exams. The university is also highly recognized for the high number of entrepreneurs among the graduates (for example in <a>bioscience</a> firms) and the amount of funds raised from outside sources.</p>
<p>The Center of Biotechnology (&quot;<a>BIOTEC</a>&quot;) is a unique interdisciplinary center focusing on research and teaching in molecular <a>bioengineering</a>. The BIOTEC hosts top international research groups dedicated to <a>genomics</a>, <a>proteomics</a>, <a>biophysics</a>, <a>cellular machine</a>s, <a>tissue engineering</a>, and <a>bioinformatics</a>.</p>
<p>The number of students per professor is lower than the national average but the quality of facilities is ranked slightly worse.</p>
<p>The university is currently developing new strategies to make itself more independent from state funding and decision making. As one of the first universities in Germany it has opened a branch in <a>Hanoi</a>, <a>Vietnam</a> offering a Master's course in <a>mechatronics</a>. It also maintains close partnerships with leading universities around the world, e.g. <a>Boston University</a>, <a>Georgetown University</a>, <a>Harvard Medical School</a> and <a>Tongji University</a>.</p>
<p>In <a>2009</a> <a>TU Dresden</a>, all Dresden institutes of the <a>Fraunhofer Society</a>, the <a>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community</a> and the <a>Max Planck Society</a> and <a>Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a>, soon incorporated into the <a>Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres</a>, published a joint letter of intent with the name DRESDEN-Konzept - Dresden Research and Education Synergies for the Development of Excellence and Novelty, which points out worldwide elite aspirations, which was recognized as the first time that all four big post-gradual elite institutions declared campus co-operation with a university. These German semi-public institutes hire their team leaders globally and settle freely within Germany and the city of Dresden has appealed to an unmatched absolute number of them.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Slub-dresden-reading-room-2.JPG|thumb|right|200px| [[SLUB]] &#x2014; Saxon State Library - Regional and University Library Dresden]] TU Dresden is a campus university in most aspects. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old (such as the buildings around Muenchner Platz square). The architecture of these buildings is mostly influenced by the art nouveau style or the Bauhaus school (e.g. the Chemistry building <em>Fritz-Foerster-Bau</em>). In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).</p>
<p>The main campus, as well as the medical faculty and that of Computer Science, are all within the boundaries of the city of Dresden. The main campus is located South of the city center, mostly in the area bordered by N&#x00f6;thnitzer Stra&#x00df;e, Fritz-F&#x00f6;rster-Platz and M&#x00fc;nchner Platz; the medical faculty can be found in the Johannstadt district. The faculty of forestry resides in a forest area in the nearby town of Tharandt.</p>
