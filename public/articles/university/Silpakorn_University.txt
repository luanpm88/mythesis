<p><strong>Silpakorn University</strong> () is a well-known government-sponsored <a>university</a> in <a>Thailand</a>. The university was founded in <a>Bangkok</a> in 1943 by <a>Italian</a>-born art professor Corrado Feroci, who took the Thai name <a>Silpa Bhirasri</a> when he became a Thai citizen. It is the leading Thai university in the fine arts and archaeology, and now includes many other faculties as well. It has about 20,000 students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1939 the Pranete Silpakam School was founded on the grounds of Thapra Palace, just north of the Grand Palace, by <a>Mom Luang</a> <a>Pin Malakul</a>. Four years later, during <a>World War II</a>, it became Thailand's third government university. </p>
<p>In 1968 the Royal Thai Ministry of Education granted permission for Silpakorn University to include additional majors, which led to the establishment of the <a>Sanam Chan Palace</a> campus in <a>Nakhon Pathom</a>, west of Bangkok. Later, when more faculties were added, the Phetchaburi campus was built. Located on the coast southwest of Bangkok, it is known as the &quot;Phetchaburi IT campus.&quot;</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
