<p>Founded in 1887, it is the oldest educational institution founded as an all-graduate university. Clark now also educates <a>undergraduates</a>.  It is one of only three New England universities, along with <a>Harvard</a> and <a>Yale</a>, to be a founding member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, an organization of universities with the most prestigious profiles in research and graduate education. Clark withdrew its membership in 1999, citing a conflict with its mission; it is one of only two schools to do so. Clark is one of 40 schools profiled in the book Colleges That Change Lives by Loren Pope. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clark University was founded by American businessman <a>Jonas Gilman Clark</a> in 1887. He started the university with a million dollars, and later added another million dollars to the university fund because he feared the university might someday face lack of funds. The university was opened on October 2, 1889 as the first all-graduate university in the United States.</p>
<p><a>G. Stanley Hall</a> was the first president of the university. He was the founder of the <a>American Psychological Association</a>, and earned the first <a>Ph.D.</a> in <a>psychology</a> in the <a>United States</a> at <a>Harvard</a>. Clark has played a prominent role in the development of psychology as a distinguished discipline in the United States ever since. It was the location for <a>Sigmund Freud</a>'s famous &quot;Clark Lectures&quot; in 1909, introducing <a>psychoanalysis</a> to the US. The university celebrated the centennial of the visit in October 2009.</p>
<p><a>Franz Boas</a>, founder of American <a>cultural anthropology</a> and advisor for the first Ph.D. in anthropology, taught at Clark between 1888 and 1892 before resigning (in a dispute with <a>Hall</a> over academic freedom) and moving to <a>Columbia University</a>. <a>Albert Abraham Michelson</a>, the first American to receive a <a>Nobel Prize in Physics</a>, best known for his involvement in the <a>Michelson-Morley experiment</a>, which measured the speed of light, served as a professor from 1889 to 1892. In the 1920s <a>Robert Goddard</a>, a pioneer of rocketry, considered one of the founders of space and missile technology, served as chairman of the Physics Department. The <a>Robert H. Goddard Library</a>, a distinctive modern building by architect <a>John M. Johansen</a> was completed in 1969.</p>
<p>In April 2010, Clark University in Massachusetts received the largest gift in its 123-year history, a $14.2 million offering from the late head of a company that ultimately grew into one of the nation's biggest property and casualty insurers. The gift from John Adam is intended to strengthen Clark's graduate programs in education, promote college-readiness among minority students and bolster its research profile related to urban education.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2010, former provost David Angel became the ninth President of Clark.</p>
<h2>Clark firsts</h2>
<p>Clark University was the second institution in the U.S. with Ph.D. programs. Clark's geography program is the only one in North America to have a mountain range named for it. The <a>Clark Mountains</a>, <a>Antarctica</a>, were named by one of the program&#x2019;s graduates, Paul Siple, famed meteorologist, explorer and inventor of the &#x201c;wind chill factor.&#x201d; Siple named the peaks of the Clark Mountains after his faculty instructors: Jones, Atwood, Burnham, <a>Walter Elmer Ekblaw</a>, and Van Valkenburg.</p>
<p><a>George Blakeslee</a>, history professor from 1903 to 1943, founded the first journal about international relations, which was later absorbed by <em><a>Foreign Affairs</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus is located on Main Street in the <a>Main South</a> neighborhood about two miles west of downtown Worcester, which is about 40 miles west of Boston.</p>
<p>Jonas Clark Hall, which was built in 1887 is in the center of campus and houses the economics, psychology and education departments. The Lasry Center (named for investor <a>Marc Lasry</a> and his wife Cathy) for Bioscience houses the biology department. It received a LEED Gold certification. The Jefferson Academic Center houses various social science departments. The Academic Center at Goddard Library houses more than 375,000 volumes. Administrative offices are housed in small buildings on Downing Street. </p>
<p>Students entering Clark must live on campus for the first two years unless their primary address is within 25 miles of campus. The residence halls at Clark are organized by those who live there; the</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First Year Experience</strong> halls (Bullock, Sanford, and Wright)</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed Class</strong> halls (Johnson, Dana and Hughes)</li>
  <li><strong>Single Sex</strong> hall (Dodd&#x2014;female only)</li>
  <li><strong>Suite-style and Apartment-style</strong> halls (Maywood and Blackstone)</li>
</ul>
<p>Clark owns apartments that, while outside of the main campus area, exclusively house Clark students.</p>
<p>The first Clark &quot;residence halls&quot; (Wright and Bullock) opened in 1959.  Before that time Estabrook Hall was the men's dormitory and small women's dorms stood in the current location of Little Center and Bullock Hall. Blackstone, the newest of the halls, opened in 2007.</p>
<p>As of fall 2007, gender blind/neutral housing is an option at Clark, meaning that students of different genders can room together.</code></p>

<p>Clark University released its Climate Action Plan on December 15, 2009 detailing strategies for the University to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening many of its existing sustainability practices. The plan sets two goals with respect to climate neutrality: First is an interim goal of reducing emissions to 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2015. The second goal is to achieve climate neutrality (net zero greenhouse gas emissions) by the year 2030.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Since its founding in 1887, Clark University in Worcester, Mass., has a history of challenging convention. As an innovative liberal arts college and research university, Clark&#x2019;s world-class faculty lead a community of creative thinkers and passionate doers and offer a range of expertise, particularly in the areas of psychology, geography, urban education, Holocaust and genocide studies, environmental studies, and international development and social change. Clark&#x2019;s students, faculty and alumni embody the Clark motto: Challenge convention. Change our world.</p>
<p>Clark offers 31 undergraduate majors.</p>
<h3>Student body</h3>
<p>Clark has marketed its programs off-campus and accepts a student body largely from out of the city and often from out of the state. Clark&#x2019;s student body comes from all over the country and world. Sixty-eight percent of Clark undergraduate students are from outside Massachusetts and 8% are from abroad. The entire student body of undergraduate and graduate students is 16% international.</p>
<p>, Clark's freshman class consisted of 550 students with an average high school GPA of 3.46, average Verbal SAT of 597 and average Math SAT of 587. Seventy-nine percent of the freshmen were from top 30% of their high school class. Ninety-seven percent of freshmen live in campus housing.  Of the freshmen, 64% are from outside Massachusetts and 90% receive need- or merit-based financial aid.  There were also 27 transfer students.</p>
<h3>Clark and the community</h3>
<p>In 1985, the university engaged in a partnership with community groups and business organizations to revitalize Clark neighborhoods. Its efforts in the University Park Partnership program include refurbishing dilapidated or abandoned homes, reselling them to area residents, and subsidizing mortgages for new home buyers.</p>
<p>In 1997, Clark opened a secondary public school, the <a>University Park Campus School</a> (UPCS), that is also a professional development school for Clark&#x2019;s teacher education program. Because of its long hours and demanding curricula, UPCS has been lauded as a model for collaboration between a university and an urban district. Students are able to attend Clark University free of charge upon graduation, provided they meet certain residency and admissions requirements. In the May 16, 2005, issue of <a>Newsweek</a>, UPCS was named the 68th best high school in the nation. On November 22, 2007, UPCS was featured in a cover story entitled &#x201c;Town-gown triumph In poorest part of Worcester, Clark helps put children on path to college&#x201d;  in the Boston Globe, by Peter Schworm, Globe Staff.</p>
<p>The UPCS collaborative is one of several sponsored by Clark's Jacob Hiatt Center for Urban Education focused on urban teacher education and school reform.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Clark has eight research institutes and centers.</p>
<p><strong>The William and Jane Mosakowski Institute</strong> for Public Enterprise seeks to improve through the successful mobilization of use-inspired research the effectiveness of government and other institutions in addressing social concerns.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>In March 2009, Clark University convened a first-of-its-kind National Conference on Liberal Education and Effective Practice, co-sponsored by Clark&#x2019;s Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise and the Association of American Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>The Mosakowsi Institute for Public Enterprise was established in the fall of 2007 thanks to a generous founding gift from two Clark alumni, William '76 and Jane '75 Mosakowski.</p>
<p>Secretary of State and former senator and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke at Clark University on February 4, 2008 to an audience of approximately 3,500 in The Kneller Athletic Center.</p>
<p>In April 2009, then-President John Bassett denied Clark University Students for Palestinian Rights, a student group, the right to bring <a>Norman Finkelstein</a> to speak about the &quot;<a>Gaza Massacre</a>&quot; (2008-2009 Gaza War) because Finkelstein &quot;would invite controversy and not dialogue or understanding&quot;. He also cited a conflict in scheduling regarding a conference on Holocaust and Genocide Studies put on by the university in the same month. However, following protests, which included a public protest in the center of campus, a petition campaign and outreach by alumni, students and faculty, Basset reversed his decision and allowed Finkelstein to speak on April 27, the last day of classes for the semester. Finkelstein spoke to around 400 students, faculty and community members in Atwood Hall.</p>
