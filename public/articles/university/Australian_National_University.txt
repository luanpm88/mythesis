<p>  <strong>The Australian National University</strong>, commonly abbreviated to <strong>ANU</strong>, is a <a>public teaching and</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Canberra</a>. The University was established by an act of the <a>Parliament of Australia</a> and came into being on 7 February 1947, with the legislated purpose of conducting and promoting research in Australia.</p>
<p>The University is governed by a 15-member council. ANU is a member of several university alliances and cooperative networks, including the <a>Group of Eight (Australian universities)</a>, the <a>Association of Pacific Rim Universities</a>, the <a>Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy</a> and the <a>International Alliance of Research Universities</a>.</p>
<p>ANU includes five <a>Nobel laureates</a> among its <a>staff and alumni</a>.</p>
<h2>Arms</h2>
<p>The ANU logo is composed of three elements; the crest, the logotype, and the name of the University. The name of the University is printed in capitalised <a>Rotis Semi Sans</a>. The university's coat of arms is a blue shield bearing a stylised representation of Australia beneath the stars of the <a>Southern Cross</a>. The motto is written on a scroll beneath the shield,  <em>Naturam Primum Cognoscere Rerum</em> (&quot;First to learn the nature of things&quot;).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Australian National University was established by an act of the <a>Parliament of Australia</a>, introduced by the then Prime Minister <a>Ben Chifley</a> and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <a>J.J. Dedman</a>. The bill was passed on 1 August 1946 with support of the Opposition Leader <a>Robert Menzies</a>.  Its provisions came into effect on 7&nbsp;February 1947. ANU is the only Australian university to be established by an act of the Federal Parliament; all other Australian universities were established by State or Territory parliaments.</p>
<p>A group of eminent Australian scholars were involved in the infancy of ANU, including: Sir <a>Mark Oliphant</a>, a leader in radar development and nuclear physics; Sir <a>Howard Florey</a>, a co-discoverer of the benefits of penicillin; Sir <a>Keith Hancock</a>, an eminent historian;  and <a>H. C. Coombs</a>, a renowned economist and public servant.</p>
<p>After its establishment, the University conducted research and provided postgraduate education.  Later, in 1960, the former <a>Canberra University College</a> was amalgamated into The Australian National University as the School of General Studies to provide for the education of <a>undergraduate</a> students.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>The governing body is a 15 member Council which governs under the <em>Australian National University Act 1991</em>. The Council's key responsibilities include appointing the Vice Chancellor and Principal, approving the strategic direction and annual budget, establishing operational policies and procedures, and overseeing academic and commercial activities as well as risk management. The chair of the Council is the Chancellor, Professor the Hon <a>Gareth Evans</a> AO QC.</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>In 2009, the university had an endowment of approximately $1.1023 billion.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<pre>[[File:Mt Stromlo Obs2.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Stromlo after the fires: remains of the old administration building with the dome of the Farnham telescope]]</pre>
<h3>Acton</h3>
<p>The university's main campus occupies most of the <a>Canberra</a> suburb of <a>Acton</a>. The campus covers  adjoining native bushland, <a>Black Mountain</a>, <a>Lake Burley Griffin</a>, the suburb of <a>Turner</a> and the <a>city centre</a>. The ANU campus is divided into eight precincts, with three on the west side of Sullivans Creek; Dickson Precinct, Linnaeus Precinct, Daley Precinct; and five on the east side; Kingsley Precinct, Baldessin Precinct, Ellery Precinct, Liversidge Precinct and Garran Precinct. With over 10,000 trees on its campus, the ANU was awarded the Silver Greenhouse Challenge Award at the annual Australian Engineering Excellence Awards in 2003.</p>

<h3>Other Campuses</h3>
<p>The Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) is located away from the main campus in Acton, at the <a>Mount Stromlo Observatory</a>, near <a>Weston Creek</a> in south <a>Canberra</a>. RSAA also runs the <a>Siding Spring Observatory</a> near <a>Coonabarabran</a>, <a>New South Wales</a>. Since the destruction of Mount Stromlo's telescopes in the <a>Canberra bushfires</a> of 2003, this is university's only telescope site. The university also runs a coastal campus at <a>Kioloa</a> on the <a>South Coast</a> of <a>New South Wales</a> dedicated to field work training, and a North Australia Research Unit in <a>Darwin</a> in the <a>Northern Territory</a>.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students on all campuses are represented by the <a>ANU Students' Association</a>. Postgraduate students are represented by the Postgraduate and Research Students' Association (PARSA), a member of the <a>Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations</a>. The <a>Australian National University Union</a> provides representation to all students in the provision of catering and retail services as well as functions amenities.</p>
<h3>Residential Halls and Colleges</h3>
<p>Eight of the university's nine affiliated halls and colleges are located on campus, while Fenner Hall is located on Northbourne Avenue in the nearby suburb of <a>Braddon</a>. The halls and colleges are: <a>Bruce Hall</a>, <a>Ursula Hall</a>, <a>Fenner Hall</a>, <a>Burgmann College</a>, <a>John XXIII College</a>, <a>Burton &amp; Garran Hall</a>, <a>UniLodge Davey</a>, <a>UniLodge Kinloch</a>, <a>Toad Hall</a>, <a>University House</a> and <a>Graduate House</a>.</p>
<p>Burgmann and neighbouring John XXIII College are the only remaining independent residential colleges among the Australian National University's ten halls of residence. Burgmann and John XXIII continue to administer their own admissions processes separate from the university's central clearinghouse for accommodation.</p>
<p>Although the University accommodation houses more than 3,700 students, the ANU suffers from chronic shortage of student accommodation, due in part to over-enrolment.</p>
<h2>Academic  Structure</h2>
<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p>The ANU is divided into seven academic Colleges. Each College is responsible for undergraduate and postgraduate education as well as research in its respective field. <a>thumb|right|ANU College of Law.</a> <a>thumb|ANU School of Medicine</a> <a>thumb|right|ANU School of Art</a> </p>

The new National Institute is intended to centralize public policy expertise. A good portion of the funds ($53.1 million) were earmarked for building and developing the previously announced <a>Australian Centre on China in the World</a>, which is one of three specialist centres along with the <a>National Security College</a> and the <a>Australia and New Zealand School of Government</a> to be specifically incorporated under the umbrella of the National Institute. $19.8 million is set aside to create a joint building for the other two centres, with a further $17.3 million expressly dedicated to the National Security College.</p>
<h3>Current Research</h3>
<p>The Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) is based at the <a>Mount Stromlo Observatory</a>. RSAA runs university's telescopes at the <a>Siding Spring Observatory</a>, in <a>NSW</a>. On Thursday 20 April 2006 it was reported that the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics would build the world's most powerful telescope. This project is a collaboration between an elite international group of research institutions which also includes the <a>University of Arizona</a>, <a>Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a> and <a>Harvard University</a>.</p>
<h2>Library System</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|left|Chifley Library</a>[[File:R.G. Menzies Building, ANU Canberra with tree (124083585).jpg|thumb|[[Robert Menzies|R. G. Menzies]] Building]] The <strong>Australian National University Library</strong> is part of the ANU's Division of Information. The Australian National University Library began with the appointment of the first University Librarian, Arthur Leopold Gladstone McDonald in early 1948. The establishment of the ANU Library was deemed so important to the development of the University, that McDonald was appointed by the Interim Council before any of the professors.</p>
<p>Initially McDonald and several assistants were housed in <a>Ormond College</a> at the <a>University of Melbourne</a>, where they began to form the collection. At the end of 1950s the collection, which had grown to approximately 40,000 volumes, was transferred to Canberra, to be located in the Canberra Community Hospital and nearby huts. Over the course of the 1950s the collection grew steadily, and by the time of McDonald's retirement in the 1960s, the collection had grown to 150,000 volumes.</p>
<p>The ANU Library collection is housed in 4 main locations; the R.G. Menzies Building (Asia Pacific material), the J.B. Chifley Building (Social Sciences &amp; Humanities material), the W.K. Hancock Building (Science material) and the Law Library in the Law School Building. Additional services are provided by 5 science branch libraries; Art Library, Chemistry Branch Library, Earth Sciences Branch Library, Eccles Medical Sciences Library, and Music Library. The ANU owns a collection of rare books, housed in a closed access collection held in the Rare Book Room in the R.G. Menzies Building.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
