<p> <strong>Kansas State University</strong>, commonly shortened to <strong>K-State</strong>, is an institution of higher learning located in <a>Manhattan</a>, <a>Kansas</a>, in the <a>United States</a>.  The university saw a record high enrollment of 23,588 students for the Fall 2010 semester.&lt;ref name = Enrollment/&gt;</p>
<p>A branch campus is located in <a>Salina, Kansas</a>, housing the <a>College of Technology and Aviation</a>.  Another branch campus, known as the Olathe Innovation Campus, is presently under construction in <a>Olathe, Kansas</a>.  When completed, the Olathe facility will be the academic research presence within the Kansas Bioscience Park, and will research bioenergy, animal health, plant science and food safety and security.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university is classified as a research university with very high research (RU/VH) by the <a>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kansas State University, originally named Kansas State Agricultural College, was founded on February 16, 1863, during the <a>American Civil War</a>, as a <a>land-grant institution</a> under the <a>Morrill Act</a>.&lt;ref name=Willard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The school was the first land-grant college newly <em>created</em> under the Morrill Act, although several other universities claim to be the <em>oldest</em> land-grant school.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt; K-State is the fourth-oldest school in the <a>Big 12 Conference</a> and the oldest public university in the state of Kansas.</p>
<p>The effort to establish the school began in 1861, when <a>Kansas</a> was admitted to the <a>United States</a>.  One of the new state <a>legislature's</a> top priorities involved establishing a state university. That year, the delegation from Manhattan introduced a bill to convert the old <a>Blue Mont Central College</a> (a private college incorporated in Manhattan in 1858) into the state university.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  But the bill establishing the university in Manhattan was controversially <a>veto</a>ed by Governor <a>Charles L. Robinson</a> of Lawrence, and an attempt to override the veto in the Legislature failed by two votes.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1862, another bill to make Manhattan the site of the state university failed by one vote.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;  Finally, upon the third attempt on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds and established the state's land-grant college at the site &#x2013; the institution that would become Kansas State University.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;</p>
<p>When the college opened for its first session in September 1863, it became only the <a>third public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally</a> in the United States.  Enrollment for the first session totaled 52 students: 26 men and 26 women.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;</p>
<h3>19th century</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The university in 1878</a> The early years of the institution witnessed debate over whether the college should provide a focused agricultural education or a full <a>liberal arts</a> education. During this era, the tenor of the school shifted with the tenure of university presidents.  For example, President <a>John A. Anderson</a> (1873&#x2013;1879) favored a limited education and President <a>George T. Fairchild</a> (1879&#x2013;1897) favored a classic liberal education.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairchild was credited with saying, &quot;Our college exists not so much to make men farmers as to make farmers men.&quot;&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;</p>
<p>During this era, in 1873, Kansas State also helped pioneer the academic teaching of <a>home economics</a> for women, becoming one of the first two colleges to offer the program of study.&lt;ref name=HomeEc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>The name of the school changed in 1931 to Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science.  In 1959, the name changed again to Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Science to reflect a growing number of graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Milton S. Eisenhower</a> served as president of the university from 1943 to 1950, and Dr. James McCain succeeded him, serving from 1950 to 1975. Several buildings, including <a>residence hall</a>s and a student union, were added to the campus in the 1950s. The 1960s witnessed demonstrations against the <a>Vietnam War</a>, though fewer than at other college campuses. Enrollment was relatively high through most of the 1970s, but the university endured a downward spiral from approximately 1976 to 1986, when enrollment decreased to 17,570 and a number of faculty resigned. In 1986, <a>Dr. Jon Wefald</a> assumed the presidency of Kansas State University. During his tenure, enrollment and donations increased. [[Image:PostcardHorticulturalHallManhattanKA1907.jpg|thumb|[[Dickens Hall]], from a 1907 postcard]] On June 15, 2009, <a>Kirk Schulz</a> became the 13th president of Kansas State University.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Kansas State Collegian</a> <em>Schulz begins new term</em>&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 he announced his K-State 2025 plan.&lt;ref&gt;<a>K-State News Services</a> &quot;K-State beginning ambitious plan for next 15 years to be a top 50 public university&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is designed to elevate K-State to a top 50 nationally recognized research university by 2025.</p>
<h3>Historic buildings</h3>
<p>The university moved from the location of Blue Mont Central College to its present site in 1875.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt; The original site is now occupied by <a>Central National Bank</a> and Founders Hill Apartments. The oldest building on the present campus is the original section of Seaton Hall (then named the Industrial Workshop), built in 1875.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;  Holtz Hall, built in 1876, was the first new building erected after the move and is now the oldest free-standing building on campus.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;  The signature building at Kansas State University, <a>Anderson Hall</a>, developed in three stages between 1877 and 1884.  Anderson Hall, now listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>, has housed the university's administrative offices for more than a century.</p>
<h2>Academic profile</h2>
<p>[[Image:KSU Anderson Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Anderson Hall (Kansas State)|Anderson Hall]]]] Since 1986, Kansas State ranks first nationally among state universities in its total of <a>Rhodes</a>, <a>Marshall</a>, <a>Truman</a>, <a>Goldwater</a>, and Udall scholars with 124 recipients.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Kansas State University has 65 academic departments in nine colleges: <a>agriculture</a>; <a>Architecture</a>, planning and design; arts and sciences; <a>business administration</a>; <a>education</a>; <a>engineering</a>; <a>human ecology</a>; <a>technology</a> and <a>aviation</a>; and <a>veterinary medicine</a>.  The graduate school offers nearly 100 master's degree programs and nearly 50 doctoral programs.</p>
<p>In 1991, the former Kansas Technical Institute in <a>Salina, Kansas</a> was merged with Kansas State University by an act of the <a>Kansas</a> legislature.  The College of Technology and Aviation is located at the Salina campus, and is commonly referred to as <a>K-State Salina</a>.</p>
<p>K-State is also known for several distinguished lecture series: Landon Lecture, Lou Douglas Lecture, Huck Boyd Lecture, and Dorothy L. Thompson Civil Rights Lectures.</p>
<p>K-State implemented an academic <a>honor code</a> in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  When students are admitted, it is implied that they will adhere to the Honor Pledge: &quot;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&quot;</p>
<h2>Research and cultural resources</h2>
<p>[[Image:KSU Hale library.jpg|thumb|[[Hale Library]]]]</p>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>The university has had a long-standing interest in <a>agriculture</a>, particularly native <a>Great Plains</a> plant and animal life. The <a>Kansas State University Gardens</a> is an on-campus <a>horticulture</a> display garden that serves as an educational resource and learning laboratory for K-State students and the public. The <a>Konza Prairie</a> is a native tallgrass prairie preserve located south of Manhattan, which is co-owned by <a>The Nature Conservancy</a> and Kansas State University and operated as a field research station by the department of biology.  The university also owns an additional  in cities across the state that it operates as Agricultural Experiment Stations in research centers in Hays, Garden City, Colby, and Parsons.</p>
<h3>Arts and culture</h3>
<p>The university is home to several museums, including the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, the K-State Insect Zoo, the KSU Historic Costume and Textiles Museum, and the Chang, Chapman, and Kemper galleries which feature faculty and student artwork. The university also offers an annual cycle of performance art at McCain Auditorium, including concerts, plays and dance.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|Waters Quad just North of Hale Library</a></p>
<h3>The Biosciences</h3>
<p>In 2006, K-State dedicated the Biosecurity Research Institute. &lt;ref&gt;<a>K-State News Services</a> &quot;K-State's Biosecurity Research Institute to provide research, training space for food safety and security efforts&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;The BRI, in Pat Roberts Hall, is a safe and secure location in which scientists and their collaborators can study high-consequence pathogens. It was designed and constructed for biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and biosafety level 3 agriculture (BSL-3Ag) research. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The availability of the BRI was part of what attracted the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility to K-State and Manhattan. &lt;ref&gt;<a>49 News KTKA</a> &quot;NBAF officials say they plan to do research at the BRI&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; The NBAF will feature about  of research and support space. &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the NBAF will cost an estimated $650 million and should be complete by 2016. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It will stand just north of K-State's College of Veterinary Medicine and east of the BRI. &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Following the NBAF decision, leaders at two additional federal facilities announced they are coming to K-State. The Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Unit, or ABADRU, specializes in animal and plant diseases transmitted by insects. The lab is relocating from Laramie, Wyo., to K-State in order to fully realize its research mandate. &lt;ref&gt;<a>K-State Collegian</a> &quot;City officials announce relocation of federal lab&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; The Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, or CEEZAD, will research foreign animal, zoonotic and newly discovered pathogens that can have a consequential economic impact on U.S. agriculture, homeland security and human and animal health. It will be led by K-State's Dr. Juergen Richt. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Landon Lecture Series</h3>
<p>Kansas State University offers the Landon Lecture Series for students, faculty and the community.  The lecture series' name honors former Kansas governor and presidential candidate <a>Alfred Landon</a>.</p>
<p>The series has featured many prominent speakers &#x2013;&#x2013; primarily current or former political or government leaders. For example, on Jan. 23, 2006, U.S. President <a>George W. Bush</a> delivered the university's 143rd Landon Lecture at <a>Bramlage Coliseum</a>. On March 2, 2007, his predecessor, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, delivered the 149th Landon Lecture.&lt;ref name = LandonList&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, on September 23, 2008, former Mexican president <a>Vicente Fox</a> gave the 152nd Landon Lecture.&lt;ref name = LandonList/&gt; Overall, six <a>U.S. presidents</a> and three foreign presidents have given Landon Lectures at K-State.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  There are approximately four speakers per year.</p>
