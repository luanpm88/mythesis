<p>    The <strong>Innsbruck Medical University</strong> (in German: <strong>Medizinische Universit&#x00e4;t Innsbruck</strong>) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Innsbruck</a>, <a>Tyrol</a>, <a>Austria</a>. It used to be one of the fours historical <a>faculties</a> of the <a>Leopold-Franzens-Universit&#x00e4;t Innsbruck</a> but became an independent university in 2004.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The medical tradition dates back long before the foundation of the university, with the foundation of the first hospital in the nearby silver-mining city of <a>Schwaz</a> in 1307. Due to the population increase over the centuries, an academic education for the medical personnel became crucial. Therefore, a medical faculty was included in the initial university, established in 1669 by <a>emperor Leopold I</a>, making it the first of its kind in the Alpine region.</p>
