<p>  <strong>Colorado State University</strong> is a public institution of higher learning located in <a>Fort Collins</a>, <a>Colorado</a>, in the United States. Colorado State University is the state's <a>land grant</a> university, and the flagship campus <a>university</a> of the Colorado State University System. </p>
<p>The  enrollment is approximately 27,000 students. The university has approximately 1,400 faculty in eight colleges and 55 academic departments. Bachelor's degrees are offered in 62 fields of study, with Master's degrees in 59 fields. Colorado State confers doctoral degrees in 38 fields of study, in addition to a professional degree in veterinary medicine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Colorado State University is a land-grant institution classified as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Extensive. CSU was founded as Colorado Agricultural College in 1870, six years before the Colorado Territory gained statehood. It was one of 68 land-grant colleges established under the Morrill Act of 1862. Doors opened to a freshman class of 5 students in 1879.</p>
<p>The university has operated under four different names:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1879: <strong>Agricultural College of Colorado</strong></li>
  <li>1935: <strong>Colorado College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts</strong> (<strong>Colorado A&amp;M</strong>)</li>
  <li>1944: <strong>Colorado Agricultural and Mechanical College</strong> (<strong>Colorado A&amp;M</strong>)</li>
  <li>1957: <strong>Colorado State University</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>The act to create the university was signed by <a>Colorado Territory</a> governor <a>Edward M. McCook</a> in 1870 arising from the <a>Morrill Act</a>. During the first years of its official existence, the university existed only on paper. A board of 12 trustees was formed to &quot;purchase and manage property, erect buildings, establish basic rules for governing the institutions and employ buildings.&quot;  But the near complete lack of funding by the territorial legislature for this mission severely hampered progress.</p>
<p>The first  parcel of land for the campus was deeded in 1871 by Robert Dazell. In 1872, the Larimer County Land Improvement Company contributed a second 80 acre (320,000 m&#x00b2;) parcel. The first $1000 to erect buildings was finally allocated by the territorial legislature in 1874. The funds were not sufficient, however, and trustees were required to find a matching amount, which they eventually obtained from local citizens and businesses.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Colorado Agricultural College Campus, 1920 with the Oval, Physics Building, and Guggenheim Hall showing.</a> Among the institutions which donated matching funds was the local <a>Grange</a>, which was heavily involved in the early establishment of the university. As part of this effort, in the spring of 1874 Grange No. 7 held a picnic and planting event at the corner of College Avenue and West Laurel Street, and later plowed and seeded 20 acres (80,000 m&#x00b2;) of <a>wheat</a> on a nearby field. Within several months, the university's first building, a -by-24-foot red brick building nicknamed the &quot;Claim Shanty&quot; was finished, providing the first tangible presence of the institution in Fort Collins.</p>
<p>After <a>Colorado</a> achieved statehood in 1876, the territorial law establishing the college was required to be reauthorized. In 1877, the <a>state legislature</a> created the eight-member <a>State Board of Agriculture</a> to govern the school. Early in the 21st century, the governing board was renamed the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System. The legislature also authorized a railroad right-of-way across the campus, and <a>mill levy</a> to raise money for construction of the campus' first main building, Old Main, which was completed in December 1878. Despite wall cracks and other structural problems during the first year, the building was opened in time for the welcoming of the first five students on September 1, 1879 by university president <a>Elijah Evan Edwards</a>.</p>
<p>During Colorado Agricultural College's first term in fall 1879, the school functioned more as a college-prep school than a college because of the lack of trained students. Consequently the first course offerings were arithmetic, English, U.S. history, natural philosophy, horticulture and farm economy. Students also labored on the college farm and attended daily chapel services. The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction. Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member and with students. The board's next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.</p>
<h4>President Charles Ingersoll</h4>
<p>Agricultural research was growing rapidly under Ingersoll. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided federal funds to establish and maintain experiment stations at land-grant colleges. Ainsworth Blount, CAC's first professor of practical agriculture and manager of the College Farm, had become known as a &quot;one man experiment station&quot;, and the Hatch Act expanded his original station to five Colorado locations. The curriculum expanded as well, introducing coursework in engineering, animal science, and liberal arts. New faculty members brought expertise in botany, horticulture, entomology, and irrigation engineering. CAC made its first attempts at animal science during 1883&#x2013;84, when it hired veterinary surgeon George Faville. Faville conducted free weekly clinics for student instruction and treatment of local citizen's diseased or injured animals.  Veterinary science at the college languished for many years following Faville's departure in 1886. President Ingersoll believed the school neglected special programs for women. Despite the reluctance of the institution's governing board, CAC began opening the door to liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll's last year at CAC the college had instituted a &quot;Ladies Course&quot; that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, stenography and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology.  Ingersoll's belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation. In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.</p>
<h3>Turn of the century</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Colorado Agricultural College advertisement</a> Alston Ellis encountered limited funding and rapidly decision in 1895 to reduce the number of Experiment Stations. Female students grew in number from 44 in 1892 to 112 in 1896, and by fall 1895, the college's new domestic-economy program was in place.  <a>Football</a> had a one-year stint at CAC in 1893, but Ellis was not a supporter of extracurricular activities and especially was hostile toward football.</p>
<p>Barton Aylesworth became the school's fourth president in 1899, and the combination of his non-confrontational style with the presence of the vocal Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association on the governing board allowed ranching and <a>farming</a> interests to take the college's agricultural programs to new heights, greatly influencing the development of the entire school. Initially, the influence of <a>ranching</a> interests brought tremendous progress to CAC's agricultural programs. Enrollment quadrupled, studies in veterinary medicine were re-established, and CAC's Experiment Station benefited from lobbying that finally secured state appropriations. Eventually, conflicts with agricultural interests may have prompted Aylesworth to begin promoting a balanced curriculum at CAC, which he then fought hard to defend. The conflict also led him to tire and negotiate his resignation.</p>
<p>Aylesworth was a big supporter of extracurricular activities. Football returned to the college in fall 1899, but <a>baseball</a> was the school's most popular sport. In 1903, the women's basketball team won CAC's first unofficial athletic championship, culminating with a victory over the <a>University of Colorado</a>.  New clubs, fraternities, and sororities also emerged. By 1905, the school had a fledgling music department, which two years later became the Conservatory of Music.</p>
<h3>President Charles Lory</h3>
<p>Taking office in 1909, CAC President Charles Lory oversaw the school's maturation and reconciled longstanding conflicts between supporters of a broad or specialized curriculum. He embarked on a demanding schedule of personal appearances to make Colorado Agricultural College known as an institution that served the state's needs. Another of Lory's notable achievements was putting the school on solid fiscal ground, meeting rising construction costs and freeing the institution of debt.</p>
<p>The onset of <a>World War I</a> influenced all aspects of CAC, but nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the institution's programs for farmers.  <a>World War I</a> created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado.  <a>World War I</a> also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields. In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the <a>Reserve Officers Training Corps</a>. A few months later CAC applied to establish an <a>ROTC</a> unit in <a>Fort Collins</a> and resurrected a defunct <a>National Guard</a> unit on campus. During the early 1930s, CAC's community-wide activities were greatly influenced by the <a>Great Depression</a> and the <a>Dust Bowl</a>. The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food, and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought.  President Lory sought to help <a>Colorado</a> farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens, and played a significant role in a 1930s project that supplied <a>irrigation</a> water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.</p>
<p>Lory and the State Board had challenges of their own back on campus. In response to claims that the university was falling behind national standards, the board retired or demoted several senior professors and administrators deemed past the peak of their proficiency, and hired new doctorate-holding personnel while consolidating sections of lecture courses. A student petition led to the governing-board to change the college's name to more accurately reflect the diversity of its academic programs, and the school became the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or Colorado A&amp;M, in 1935. President Lory announced his retirement in 1938, after 31 years of leadership.</p>
<h3>From World War II into the modern era</h3>
<p>Soon after <a>Pearl Harbor</a>, Colorado A&amp;M began to look like a military post, with the college serving as many as 1,500 servicemen.  New President Roy Green tried to prepare for the sudden departure of students and arrival of servicemen by improving ROTC facilities, and introducing military-training programs. Although servicemen filed onto campus, student enrollment at Colorado A&amp;M, 1,637 in fall 1942, dropped to 701 by fall 1943, and female students outnumbered their male counterparts for the first time. When the war ceased in 1945, soldiers returning from Europe and the Pacific filled U.S. higher-education institutions. Nearly 1,040 students attended the college in fall 1946, and about 1,600 students enrolled by spring 1946. Close to 80 former Aggies died in <a>World War II</a> including football talent Lewis &quot;Dude&quot; Dent.  President Green did not live long enough to enjoy more stable days at Colorado A&amp;M, his life taken by a heart attack in 1948.</p>
<h4>Colorado A&amp;M becomes a University under Bill Morgan</h4>
<p>Colorado A&amp;M shed its image as a narrow technical college and became a university in appearance and title during the 1950s under president Bill Morgan. Providing adequate student housing for an increasing number of youth approaching college age and improving cramped instructional facilities were among the first tests of Morgan's leadership. He responded, and five new residence halls were completed between 1953&#x2013;1957.  Colorado A&amp;M took advantage of a new mill levy won through aggressive lobbying to construct several new academic facilities, among them Morgan Library, completed in 1964.</p>
<p>Academic offerings grew to include advanced degrees. The State Board of Agriculture approved a doctoral degree in civil engineering in 1951, and three years later allowed other qualified departments to offer doctorates. Morgan believed students earning this advanced degree should hold it from a university, and so began a campaign to change the name of Colorado A&amp;M. In 1957, the <a>Colorado General Assembly</a> approved the new name of Colorado State University.</p>
<h4>The 1960s: Student activism</h4>
<p>Colorado State became a scene of intense student <a>activism</a> during the 1960s and early 1970s. The reduction of strict campus regulations for women was among the early targets of student activists, coming to the forefront in 1964 when a 21-year-old female student moved into unapproved off-campus housing to accommodate her late hours as editor of the student newspaper.  Continual student protests eventually led to the loosening of curfews for women and the opportunity for junior and senior coeds to live off campus.</p>
<p>The civil-rights movement on campus also picked up momentum and visibility. In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented a list of demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment. Civil rights tension resurfaced in January 1970 during a peaceful student demonstration before a Colorado State-Brigham Young University basketball game in protest of alleged racist practices of the Mormon Church. The demonstration became violent and clashes with riot police ensued.</p>
<p>Anti-military protest took place in dramatic form at Colorado State from 1968&#x2013;70. On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a placard tied to the memorial. Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers. In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held the second day of a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of <a>Cambodia</a> and the student deaths at <a>Kent State University</a>, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.</p>
<h4>1980s and 90s</h4>
<p> Colorado State entered the 1980s with a new Veterinary Teaching Hospital and a rating of Class I research university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education. The first half of the 1990s brought a renewed emphasis on undergraduate teaching and outreach arms of the university. To support the balance, CSU President Albert Yates appointed a Commission on the Undergraduate Experience, established the Programs of Research and Scholarly Excellence, and implemented a post-tenure review policy for faculty. Under Yates, the university also made significant efforts to improve administrative efficiency and reexamined its annual strategic planning.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 28, 1997, a flash flood ripped through <a>Fort Collins</a> and the Colorado State University campus. Known as the &quot;Spring Creek Flood of '97&quot;, the flood resulted from a series of heavy thunderstorms over a two-day period in west <a>Fort Collins</a>. Five people drowned south of campus, and estimated damages citywide were in excess of $200 million. Colorado State University campus suffered millions of dollars in damages to buildings and property, with Morgan Library and the Lory Student Center among the hardest hit. Fortunately, no people on campus suffered serious injuries or death.</p>
<h3>Future directions</h3>
<p>In his welcoming address for the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to set the standard for the 21st century public land-grant <a>research university</a>.  He has identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries.  A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the <a>university</a> has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace. Initial Superclusters in <a>infectious disease</a> and in <a>cancer research</a> have been launched, and an upcoming <a>clean energy</a> Supercluster dovetails with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability. A <a>wind farm</a> is being built to power the main campus, and new residence halls have been constructed according to national <a>green building</a> standards. A sustainability advisory committee has been charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.</p>
<p>While maintaining historic ties to local <a>agriculture</a>, administration officials have also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community.  Currently, CSU is party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships.  Another goal set by the university is to improve undergraduate education. Essential tasks, Penley says, are access and graduation rates, particularly for qualified low-income and minority students, and an education international in scope suited to a global economy.  Facilities improvements underway include a new biocontainment research lab, a campus center for the arts, and a new <a>computer science</a> building. With state financial support declining, CSU has also put a focus on alternate funding models based on market-based financial strategies and increased forms of private support. Marketing and public relations have also become part of university strategy to attract quality students and increase public awareness of Colorado State.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado, a mid-size city of approximately 142,000 residents at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The university's  main campus is located in central Fort Collins. CSU is also home to a  Foothills Campus, a  veterinary teaching hospital, a  agricultural campus, and the  Pingree Park mountain campus. CSU utilizes  for research centers and forestry service outside of Larimer County.</p>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>At the heart of the CSU campus lies the Oval, an expansive green area  around, lined with 65 <a>American Elm</a> trees.  Once the center of campus, the Oval is still a center of activity and a major landmark at CSU. The administration building, constructed in 1924, faces the Oval from the south end, and several academic buildings occupy its <a>perimeter</a>. The music building, once the university <a>library</a>, and Ammons Hall, formerly the women's recreational center and current home to Career Services, are among the structures around the Oval. Guggenheim Hall, which stands at the north end of the Oval, was constructed in 1910 as a gift from U.S. Senator Simon F. Guggenheim to promote the study of home economics, and was recently renovated according to <a>green building</a> standards.</p>
<p>Another campus focal point is the main plaza, around which can be found several academic buildings, Lory Student Center, and Morgan Library. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU president Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan. This facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998 following the flood of '97. Holdings currently include more than 2 million <a>books</a>, bound journals, and government documents.</p>
<p>Colorado State University's oldest existing building is Spruce Hall, constructed in 1881.  Originally a dormitory that played a vital role in the early growth of the school's student enrollment, Spruce now houses the Division of Continuing Education and the Office of Admissions. The newest academic building is the Behavioral Science building, which was completed in Summer 2010. Several other construction projects are ongoing including a new ampitheater.</em></p>
<h3>Veterinary hospital</h3>
<p>The James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital complex was constructed in 1979 and consists of three main buildings, the Main Hospital, the Horse and Food Animal Hospital, and the Large Animal Isolation Facility. Located south of the main campus in Fort Collins, the Main Hospital is a full service hospital divided into small and large animal clinics that annually serve 19,000 small animals and 2,700 large animals from around the world. The Veterinary program at Colorado State is one of the most respected in the country.</p>
<h3>Pingree Park</h3>
<p>In addition to university property in <a>Fort Collins</a>, large tracts of land for research exist in CSU's name throughout the state of <a>Colorado</a>. Among these is the <a>Pingree Park</a> campus situated in the <a>Mummy Range</a>  northwest of town. It was initially selected by former CSU president Charles A. Lory and began classes for Civil Engineering and Forestry students in 1913 and 1915, respectively. In the summertime, Pingree Park hosts educational programs for students in the College of <a>Natural Resources</a>, and is also used as a conference space for numerous corporations, government and private organizations, and universities.</p>
<h3>Foothills Campus</h3>
<p>The  Foothills Campus, located on northwest edge of <a>Fort Collins</a>, is home to <a>atmospheric sciences</a>, as well as several research and outreach centers. The Center for Disease Control, Engineering Research Center, Agricultural Research Center, B.W. Pickett Equine Center, Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, The Colorado Division of Wildlife, and the Animal Reproduction Biotechnology Lab can all be found at the Foothills Campus. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has converted an aircraft manufacturing facility near Christman Field into a Motorsport Research facility.</p>
<p>A new addition to the Foothills Campus, the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, opened in Fall of 2007 as an addition to the Judson M. Harper (former Vice President of Research) Research Complex. It houses some of the University's top research facilities including three high-security containment &quot;pods.&quot; This laboratory is among few in the United States to have level-tree biocontainment security.</p>

<p>CSU faculty members are noted for their research on great global challenges including the reemergence of tuberculosis, the brown cloud of air pollution in Asian cities, severe weather forecasting, nutrition and wellness, and bio-terrorism. CSU researchers in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences process and manage incoming data from a new satellite called CloudSat, which enables scientists to see cloud properties and vertical structure. Since its launch, CloudSat has made 5,307 orbits around the Earth. Abound Solar (formerly known as AVA Solar), a start-up formed by a CSU engineering professor, is commercializing a method for manufacturing low-cost, high-efficiency solar panels. Another recent research project has taken CSU faculty to Mexico to study dengue fever. Research in the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory has created a technological solution to limit pollutants from single-stroke engines, and is now in widespread use in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Outlying campuses cater to a range of research activities including crops research, animal reproduction, public health and watershed management. The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) was established in 1888 in accordance with provisions of the <a>Hatch Act</a> calling for experiment stations at land-grant universities.  State and federal funds support CAES research programs. In 2007, research activities included pest management, food safety and nutrition, environmental quality, plant and animal production systems, and community and rural development. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultra Violet Science and Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, partners industry with Colorado State University, CU-Boulder, and the University of California-Berkeley. The center has three research thrusts in Engineered EUV Sources, Imaging, Patterning, and Metrology,  The center develops biofuels and bio-refining technologies.</p>
<p>Colorado State's new research Supercluster model brings together researchers across disciplines to work on topics of global concern in which CSU has a demonstrated expertise. Research results are connected to the marketplace through transfer, patenting and licensing activities carried out by experts with a focus on each research area. CSU has established Superclusters in Infectious Disease and Cancer Research and Treatment. A third, in clean energy, is being developed. CSU has a well established research program in infectious disease. The new Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, funded by the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, is home to scientists developing vaccines and drugs for some world's most devastating diseases. The Biocontainment Laboratory also houses one of 10 US Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases, funded by a $40 million grant from the <a>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a>. Much of the Cancer Supercluster, which involves the collaboration of 5 colleges, is based around the work of the university's Animal Cancer Center, the largest center of its kind in the world.</p>
<h4>Programs of Research and Scholarly Excellence</h4>
<p>The Programs of Research and Scholarly Excellence at Colorado State University, initiated in 1991, are internally distinguished every four years following an extensive nomination and review process.</p>
<p><strong>Currently designated Programs of Research and Scholarly excellence are the following</strong>:&lt;br&gt; Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory&lt;br&gt; Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology&lt;br&gt; Center for Research on Writing and Communication Technologies&lt;br&gt; Department of Atmospheric Sciences&lt;br&gt; Department of Chemistry&lt;br&gt; Department of Occupational Therapy&lt;br&gt; Department of Statistics&lt;br&gt; Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory&lt;br&gt; Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Program&lt;br&gt; Infectious Diseases Program&lt;br&gt; Musculoskeletal Research&lt;br&gt; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&lt;br&gt; Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory&lt;br&gt; The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory studies the environment and promotes sustainability through collaborative application of ecology and ecosystem science principles. NREL has widened in scope since its beginnings in 1968 as a leader in grassland research. Current projects include The African Ecosystems Program, Program for Global Environmental Sustainability, and the Rocky Mountain Environment and Society Program.</p>
<h3>International programs</h3>
<p>Approximately 700 students per year participate in educational programs abroad, and 1,200 foreign students and scholars from more than 90 countries are engaged in academic work and research on campus. The initial pilot studies for the Peace Corps were conducted by Colorado State faculty, and the university is consistently one of the top-ranking institutions in the nation for the recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers [<a>http://newsinfo.colostate.edu/index.asp?page=news_item_display&amp;news_item_id=764645172</a>]. Since 1988, CSU and the Peace Corps have participated in four cooperative master's degree programs in English, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Natural Resources, and Agriculture. The program involves at least 2 semesters of course work at CSU combined with time abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer. Colorado State offers various programs on campus for students interested in international issues. Regional specializations with core courses and electives are available in Asian Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central Europe Studies. The Global Village Living Learning Community is a housing option for students with international interests.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Honors Program provides challenging and enriching programs for high achieving students in all majors through two academic tracks. One track is designed for students aiming to complete their general education requirements within the Honors Program, and a second is composed of upper division courses, usually appropriate for currently enrolled or transfer students. The Academic Village, which opened in fall 2007, offers 180 Honor students the opportunity to live in the Honors Living Learning Community.  1,126 students participated in the Honors Program in fall 2007.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Colorado State University competes in 16 sponsored intercollegiate sports, including 10 for women (<a>cross country</a>, <a>indoor track</a>, outdoor track, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>softball</a>, and <a>water polo</a>) and six for men (<a>football</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>indoor track</a>, outdoor track, <a>basketball</a>, and <a>golf</a>). Colorado State's athletic teams compete along with 8 other institutions in the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>, which is an <a>NCAA</a> Division I conference and sponsors Division I FBS football. The Conference was formed in 1999, splitting from the former 16-member Western Athletic Conference. CSU has won 9 MWC tournament championships and won or shared 11 regular season titles. Rams football teams won or shared the Mountain West title in 1999, 2000 and 2002.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|Looking west towards the Intramural Fields on CSU Campus.</a> Fort Collins is located  north of Denver, approximately 2 hours from major ski resorts and 45 minutes from <a>Rocky Mountain National Park</a>. There are opportunities for students to be active, with bike trails and hiking nearby. In 2006, <em><a>Money</a></em> ranked Fort Collins as the &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; in the United States.</p>
<h3>Clubs and activities</h3>
<p>There are 325 student organizations and 34 honor societies at CSU. 60% of undergraduates participate in intramural sports while 5% join one of 19 fraternities and 14 sororities.  There are 27 club sports, including cycling, baseball, water polo, triathlon,Wrestling, and Rugby. 300 music, theatre and dance performances, exhibitions, and other arts events take place on campus each year. The student government is the Associated Students of Colorado State University. CSU's daily newspaper is the <a>Rocky Mountain Collegian</a>. CSU also has a student-run campus <a>television station</a> and a student <a>radio station</a>, KCSU FM.</p>
<h4>Sport clubs</h4>
<p>Sport Clubs at Colorado State University were established in 1978. They are run and funded by student fees and team fundraisers and compete with other colleges and universities but not at the NCAA level. There are currently 27 Sport Club teams. Every year the clubs take a combined 150 trips. There are over 1,000 students associated with the program. Last year 23 of these teams competed at regional and national championships. The programs have enjoyed a significant amount of recent success with National Championships in: Women's Lacrosse (2008, 2010); Baseball (2004,2005,2006,2008,2009,2010); Men's Lacrosse (1999,2001,2003,2006). </p>
<p>The sport clubs at Colorado State University include: Alpine Ski Team, Baseball, Bowling (Coed), Crew, Cycling, Field Hockey, Horse Polo (Men's and Women's), Ice Hockey (Men's and Women's), In-Line Hockey, Lacrosse (Men's and Women's), Logging Sports, Rodeo (Men's and Women's), Rugby (Men's and Women's), Shotgun Sports (Men's and Women's), Snowboard, Soccer (Men's and Women's), Synchronized Ice Skating, Triathlon (Coed), Ultimate Frisbee Summer League, Ultimate Frisbee (Men's and Women's), Volleyball, Water Polo (Men's and Women's), and Wrestling (Men's and Women's)  By the 1970s, the Collegian was consistently publishing daily. Editorial quality and financial support have varied over the years, at times rising among elite college newspapers and at others struggling to publish. During the 1990s, the paper was twice selected as one of the top 12 daily student papers in the country. In late 2007, the Collegian published a staff article that incited national debate about free speech. The article read, in its entirety, &quot;Taser This...Fuck Bush.&quot; This event, as well as president Penley's considerations of &quot;partnering&quot; out the Collegian by Gannett in January 2008, lead to proposals in making CSU's student media, including the Rocky Mountain Collegian, a not-for-profit organization independent from the university.  This resulted in the entirety of CSU Student Media to separate from the university to operate under an independent company, the Rocky Mountain Student Media Corporation.</p>
<p>KCSU is Colorado State's student run station, with a format focusing on alternative and college rock music, including <a>indie rock</a>, punk, hip-hop and electronic music. News, sports and weather updates along with talk programs and specialty shows round out the programming schedule. Broadcasting at 10,000 <a>watt</a>s, KCSU is among the larger college stations in the country, reaching approximately 250,000 listeners. KCSU first began broadcasting in 1964 as a station owned, operated and financed by students. Following a long period as a professional station, KCSU again became student run in 1995, at which time the current format was adopted. As with the Collegian and CTV, KCSU was hit hard by the 1997 flood, and for a time was forced to broadcast from remote locations. Now back in its original Lory Student Center location, KCSU has benefited from revamped production facilities and updated equipment.</p>
<p>CTV is CSU's student-run television station, that allows students to hone their media skills- reporting, writing, producing, shooting, editing- in an educational environment. The station is a winner of fourteen Rocky Mountain Collegiate Media Association awards and a Student Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Heartland Chapter.  Content includes news shows on Tuesdays &#x2013; Thursdays, a sports show on Mondays, and &quot;The Colorado Music Lounge,&quot; a coproduction with KCSU that profiles local bands performing live, which airs weekly. CTV was founded in 1989, and currently broadcasts weeknights on the university cable station (Comcast channel 11) at 9pm, with reruns at 9am and 12 noon the next day.</p>
<p>Student-run magazine College Avenue was founded in 2005 with the goal, as put forth by its founding editors, of giving students a new forum to address controversial issues affecting the campus community from their own vantage point.  Since its first issue in fall 2005, the magazine has been released quarterly, the most recent issue released in spring 2008.</p>
<h4>Greek life</h4>
<p>Greek life at Colorado State began in the fall of 1915. Currently 5% of undergraduates join one of CSUs 19 <a>fraternities</a> and 14 <a>sororities</a>.  The <a>Beta Tau Chapter of Sigma Chi</a> is the only continuously active fraternity on campus since Greek Life was founded in 1915, having never been removed from campus or having it's charter removed.</pre>
<p>From 1932 until 1949, Colorado State University was home to the Eta chapter of [[Phrateres]], a philanthropic-social organization for female college students. Eta was the 7th chapter installed and Phrateres eventually had over 20 chapters in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].  (The chapter name &quot;Eta&quot; was reused for the chapter installed at [[Arizona State University]] in 1958.)</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>12 residence halls provide on campus living for about 5,100 students. 718 apartments for students with families and 190 apartments for older or graduate students are other living options. CSU offers theme floors for people with shared interests. The halls also have a number of Living-Learning communities that directly link the on-campus living environment with a specific academic focus in Honors, engineering, natural sciences, health and wellness, equine sciences, leadership development, or pre-veterinary medicine. The Key Academic and Key Service Communities creates an academically focused residential community for freshmen who share a desire for academic achievement, active involvement in classes, community service, campus activities, and appreciation of diversity. Residents share classes and take advantage of yearlong service opportunities with a close knit group of 19 other students.</p>
<p>CSU Honors Program participants have the opportunity to live in the Honors Living Community. The new Academic Village, which opened in fall 2007, houses Living Learning Communities for 180 Honors and 240 Engineering students. Students in the College of Natural Sciences can choose to live in the Ingersoll Residential College.</p>
<h3>Student demographics</h3>
<p>In fall 2007, CSU opened its doors to 24,983 students, among them 20,765 undergraduates, 2,332 master's students, 1,347 doctoral students, and 539 professional students in the College of Biomedical and Veterinary Medicine. Of minority students, 48% are <a>Hispanic</a>, 24% <a>Asian American</a>, 16% <a>African American</a>, and 12% <a>Native American</a>.  Over the past ten years, <a>minority</a> enrollment has increased 35%, from 2,361 to 3,178, an increase from 10.9% to 13.2% of the student population.  Though progress has been made, increasing minority enrollment at CSU has been a challenge for school administrators, one made yet more difficult by high dropout rates in many Colorado high schools with concentrated minority populations.</p>
<h3>Major speakers</h3>
<p>The Monfort Lecture Series has brought important speakers to campus. Past Lecturers include <a>Jane Goodall</a>, <a>Ernesto Zedillo</a>, <a>Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, <a>Madeleine Albright</a>, <a>General</a> <a>Norman Schwarzkopf</a>, <a>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a>, and most recently, <a>Greg Mortenson</a>.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
