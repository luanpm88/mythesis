<p>  The <strong>University of Fort Hare</strong> is a <a>public university</a> in <a>Alice, Eastern Cape</a>, <a>South Africa</a>. It was a key institution in higher education for black Africans from 1916 to 1959. It offered a Western-style, academically excellent education to students from across <a>sub-Saharan Africa</a>, creating a black African elite. Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries. </p>
<p>In 1959, the university was subsumed by the <a>apartheid</a> system, but it is now part of South Africa's post-apartheid education system.  The University's main campus is located on the <a>Tyhume</a> river, in a town known as <a>Alice</a> in English and eDikeni in <a>Xhosa language</a>. It is in the <a>Eastern Cape Province</a> about 50&nbsp;km west of <a>King Williams Town</a> (or eQonce) in a region that for a while was known as the &quot;independent&quot; <a>Bantustan</a> of <a>Ciskei</a>.  In 2008, the Alice campus had some 5500 students.  A second campus at the Eastern Cape provincial capital of Bhisho was built in 1990 and hosts a few hundred students, while the campus in East London, acquired through incorporation in 2004 has some 3300 students.</p>
<h2>The Fort</h2>
<p>Originally, Fort Hare was a British <a>fort</a> in the wars between British and the <a>Xhosa</a> of the 19th century. Some of the ruins of the fort are still visible today. <a>Missionary</a> activity (<a>James Stewart</a>) led to the creation of a school for missionaries from which at the beginning of the 20th century the <a>university</a> resulted. In accord with its Christian principles, fees are minimal and heavily subsidised. Several scholarships were also available for indigent students.</p>
<h2>University</h2>
<p>Fort Hare is one of the oldest universities in southern Africa, and was the first <a>Western</a>-style <a>tertiary education</a> institution in the whole continent to be open to non-white students. (African <a>madrasah</a>s have been teaching Islam and other subjects, at a scholarly level, to all races since the 9th century.) A number of notable students have attended Fort Hare, including some who were expelled for protests during the period of <a>white minority rule</a> and thus did not <a>graduate</a>.</p>

<h2>Anti-apartheid activity</h2>
<p>In the struggle years there was much anti-<a>apartheid</a> activity, including the <a>Black Consciousness Movement</a> of <a>Steve Biko</a>. A few students became politically active and opposed the apartheid authorities who enjoyed the unqualified support of the Fort Hare authorities since it became a University in 1972. </p>
<h2>University of Fort Hare Strategic Plan 2000</h2>
<p>The programme launched by Prof. Swartz was the <em>UFH Strategic Plan 2000</em>. The plan was meant to address the universities financial situation and academic quality standards simultaneously. The focus of the university was narrowed and consequently 5 faculties remained:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Science &amp; Agriculture</li>
  <li>Social Sciences &amp; Humanities</li>
  <li>Management &amp; Commerce</li>
  <li>Law </li>
</ul>
<p>Further narrowing the focus, 14 institutes have been founded to deal with specific issues, such as the <em>UNESCO Oliver Tambo Chair of Human Rights</em>. Through their location the institutes have excellent access to poor rural areas, and consequently emphasis is placed on the role of research in improving quality of life and economic growth (and especially sustainable job creation). Among the outreach programmes, the <a>Telkom Centre of Excellence</a> maintains a &quot;living laboratory&quot; of 4 schools at <a>Dwesa</a> on the <a>Wild Coast</a>, which have introduced computer labs and internet access to areas that until 2005 did not even have electricity. The projects at Dwesa focus research on <a>Information and Communication for Development (ICD)</a>.</p>
