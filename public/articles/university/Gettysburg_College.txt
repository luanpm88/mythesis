<p><strong>Gettysburg College</strong> is a private four-year <a>liberal arts college</a> founded in 1832, in <a>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>, adjacent to the <a>famous battlefield</a>. Its athletic teams are nicknamed the Bullets. Gettysburg College has about 2,600 students, with roughly equal numbers of men and women. Gettysburg students come from 40 states and 35 countries.</p>
<p>The college is the home of <em><a>The Gettysburg Review</a></em>, a literary magazine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Gettysburg College campus entrance&lt;br&gt; 4 November 2001&lt;/p&gt;</a></p>
<h3>Founding and early roots</h3>
<p>Gettysburg College was founded in 1832 as a sister institution for the <a>Lutheran Theological Seminary</a>. Both owe their inception to <a>Thaddeus Stevens</a>, a <a>Radical Republican</a> and <a>abolitionist</a> from Gettysburg. The college's original name was Pennsylvania College; it was founded by <a>Samuel Simon Schmucker</a>. Seven years after Gettysburg College was first founded, it established a medical school, which was located in <a>Philadelphia</a>. The college was forced to close the medical school in <a>1861</a>, when students from the seceding southern states withdrew to return home, leaving it without adequate revenue.</p>
<h3>Battle of Gettysburg</h3>
<p>In June 1863, southern Pennsylvania was invaded by <a>Confederate</a> forces during the <a>Gettysburg Campaign</a>. Many local <a>militia</a> forces were formed around the area between <a>Chambersburg</a> and <a>Philadelphia</a> to face the oncoming foe.</p>
<p>Among these units was Gettysburg's 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia Regiment (PEMR). Composed mostly of students from the College and Seminary, the 26th PEMR was mustered into service on June 22, 1863. Four days later, the students saw combat just north of town, skirmishing with advanced units of Confederate <a>division</a> commander <a>Jubal A. Early</a>. Neither side suffered many casualties, but about one hundred of the militiamen were captured.</p>
<p>During the <a>Battle of Gettysburg</a>, <a>Pennsylvania Hall</a>, or Old Dorm, was used as both a <a>signal corps</a> station and <a>field hospital</a>. Penn Hall is an interesting anomaly in the battle. Due to the geographic position it held, it was used by both Confederate and <a>Union</a> troops during the battle for signal work and surgery.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1863, College President <a>Henry Louis Baugher</a> gave the benediction at the ceremony opening the National Soldiers&#x2019; Cemetery at Gettysburg; speaking after <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>. Henry Baugher was the president of Gettysburg College from 1850 until his death in 1868.</p>
<h3>Relationship with the Eisenhowers</h3>
<p>Early in his military career, <a>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and his wife, <a>Mamie</a>, lived in a house in Gettysburg that was near the college. Both were fond of the town, so they decided to retire to a working farm adjacent to the battlefield after he left the army. It was there that President Eisenhower recuperated from his 1955 heart attack.</p>
<p>While living in Gettysburg, Eisenhower became involved with Gettysburg College. He served on the Gettysburg College <a>Board of Trustees</a>, and he was given an office, which he used when writing his memoirs. Eisenhower&#x2019;s old office is now named Eisenhower House and is occupied by Gettysburg College&#x2019;s office of admissions. [<a>http://www.higheredjobs.com/InstitutionProfile.cfm?ProfileID=15666</a>] Eisenhower&#x2019;s grandson, <a>David</a>, and his granddaughter <a>Susan</a> continue a certain level of family involvement with the institution.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The college is located on a 200 acre (800,000 m&#x00b2;) campus adjacent to the <a>Gettysburg National Military Park</a>. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, is 36 miles (60&nbsp;km) from <a>Harrisburg</a>, 55 miles (80&nbsp;km) from <a>Baltimore</a>, 80 miles (130&nbsp;km) from <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, 117 miles (190&nbsp;km) from Philadelphia, and 212 miles (340&nbsp;km) from <a>New York City</a>, and 425 miles (680&nbsp;km) from <a>Boston</a>.</p>
<p>The college's main campus is roughly divided in half by <a>Pennsylvania Hall</a> (administration). The northern half contains Plank Gym, Masters Hall (physics and astronomy), Musselman Library, the College Union Building, the College Dining Center, Briedenbaugh Hall (English), and several freshman dorms and fraternities. A section of this part of campus&#x2014;known as &quot;Stine Lake,&quot; is not actually a lake, but rather a quad located outside of the library. Prior to Musselman Library being built in the late 1970s, and due to Gettysburg's wet climate and drainage issues, the quad and library site would be prone to accumulating water, creating a large, muddy &quot;lake&quot; of sorts.  Today, however, Stine Lake does not flood, but the name has stuck, to the confusion of first-year students. Additionally, the College Dining Center is known to students and faculty as &quot;Servo,&quot; after a now defunct 1980s food service company, Servomation.</p>
<p>The southern half of the main campus includes McKnight Hall (languages), Glatfelter Hall (economics, managmenent, political science, mathematics, and others), Schmucker Hall (art and music), Kline Theater, and several fraternities. Over the last half-century, the campus has expanded considerably to include land to the east of North Washington Street and to the west of the traditional campus. Since approximately 96% of students live on campus, most of this additional land is dedicated to housing. It also includes the college chapel, the admissions building, a large gymnasium and field house complex, and several athletics fields. The college has also purchased or leased a large number of buildings for student housing, including residences on Washington Street, Carlisle Street, Middle Street, Stratton Street, and others.</p>

In addition, the building contains a media theatre, computer lab, and media production center. Musselman Library is open around the clock when classes are in session. The library operates 24 hours a day on weekdays and selected hours during the weekends. In order to help facilitate late night studying, the library provides free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate at midnight to patrons who bring their own mugs.</p>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>Full network capabilities in all campus buildings and each residence hall room.

<p>On the student level, adjudication of academic disputes takes place through an Honor Commission, which holds hearings in which students are given a chance to have their say on charges brought against them.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Twenty-four sports programs, for both men and women, participate in <a>NCAA Division III</a>. Gettysburg has earned the distinction of having the best win/loss record in the <a>Centennial Conference</a> for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>The college also offers an extensive array of club, intramural, and recreational programs. Twenty-five percent of Gettysburg's students participate in intercollegiate programs, which include twelve sports for men and twelve sports for women.</p>
<h3>The Center for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness</h3>
<p>The College broke ground on the new $25 million athletic center, named the Center for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness, on May 30, 2008. The 55,000 foot Center is an upgrade from the former athletic facility, known as the Bream/Wright/Hauser Complex, and mostly opened during October 2009. Bream/Wright/Hauser still exists next to the additions. </p>
<p>The Center features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A natatorium, complete with eight lanes, four warm-up lanes, and enough space for 350 seated spectators</li>
  <li>A 10,000 foot weight and cardio room complete with flat-screen TVs </li>
  <li>Additional spaces for yoga, aerobics, spinning and martial arts classes</li>
  <li>An upgraded training room with a Hydroworx pool </li>
  <li>Rock climbing walls</li>
  <li>A student lounge called &quot;The Dive&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>The Center is expected to be fully completed by late fall/early winter, when the climbing wall is complete. It has opened in phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first phase was completed during the summer, when Bream/Wright/Hauser was overhauled. It was given new bleachers, an updated sound system, improved lighting and a new hardwood floor</li>
  <li>The second phase, which finished in October 2009, included all of the additions except for the climbing walls </li>
  <li>The third, and final phase, will be done when the climbing wall is finished&lt;ref name=&quot;GettysburgSportsPage&quot;/&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Center was created in order to provide more opportunities for the high percentage of students who like to maintain their fitness regimens and engage in intramural, club sports programs, and exercise classes. About 25 percent of the student body participates in varsity sports, while over 75 percent are active in intramural sports. More space was needed, and the Center is important to improve life on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;GettysburgAlumni&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>John Jaeger, a 1965 Gettysburg College graduate, donated $1.2 million to encourage others to fund the project. Another important donor, Robert Ortenzio, provided the largest single gift by a living person in the history of the College, by giving $2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;GettysburgAlumni&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>&quot;Loyalty Song&quot;</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Gettysburg College campus&lt;br&gt; 4 November 2001&lt;/p&gt;</a> : Fair Gettysburg our Alma Mater, hear us praise thy name, : We'll ever lend our hearts and hands to help increase thy fame. : The honor of old Gettysburg calls forth our loyalty. : So cheer (Rah! Rah!) old G'burg's Bullets on to victory!</p>
<p>However, another rendition exists with a few differences: </p>
<p>:  <em>Hail</em> Gettysburg our Alma Mater, <em>help</em> us praise thy name. :  We'll ever lend our hearts and hands to help increase thy fame. :  The honor of old Gettysburg calls forth our loyalty, :  So cheer (Rah! Rah!) <em>our</em> G'burg Bullets on to <em>fight for</em> victory!</p>
