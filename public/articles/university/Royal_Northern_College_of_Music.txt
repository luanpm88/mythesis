<p>The <strong>Royal Northern College of Music</strong> or <strong>RNCM</strong> is a <a>conservatoire</a> in <a>Manchester</a>, England. It is located on Oxford Road in <a>Chorlton on Medlock</a>, and is at the western edge of the campus of the <a>University of Manchester</a>. In addition to being a centre of <a>education</a>, the RNCM also functions as an arts centre holding concerts of all kinds, opera and other musical events. Its current principal is the composer Professor <a>Jonty Stockdale</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The roots of the college are in the late 19th century with <a>Sir Charles Hall&#x00e9;</a>'s <a>Royal Manchester College of Music</a>, Ducie Street, established in 1893. In 1973, the Royal Manchester College of Music and the <a>Northern School of Music</a> (established in 1920) merged to create the modern-day RNCM.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>The college building was built in 1968 to 1973 by architects Bickerdike, Allen, Rich and greatly extended 30 years later. </p>
<p>The Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning is housed in the new extension.</p>
<h2>Academic life</h2>
<p>Currently the college offers both undergraduate (BMus and a joint MusB/GRNCM course with the <a>University of Manchester</a>) <a>postgraduate</a> taught programmes (PGDip, MMus) in musical performance and composition. In association with the <a>Manchester Metropolitan University</a> the college now offers research degrees (MPhil, PhD) in musical performance, composition, musicology and music psychology. According to RNCM figures, as of 2007 the student population is 696, with 496 undergraduates and 200 postgraduates; 49% male, 51% female. With 265 academic staff, there is a high staff-to-student ratio. Many of the staff also teach at the Junior RNCM, a Saturday music school for talented young musicians who are keen on pursuing a musical career.</p>
<p>In January 2005, the RNCM was awarded &#x00a3;4.5 million by the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> to become a recognised Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), the only UK conservatoire to be selected. </p>
