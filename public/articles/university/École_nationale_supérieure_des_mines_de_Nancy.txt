<p> The <strong>&#x00e9;cole nationale sup&#x00e9;rieure des mines de Nancy</strong> or <strong>ENSMN</strong>, <strong>les Mines</strong>, <strong>Mines de Nancy</strong>, is one of the prestigious <a>French</a> <em>generalist</em> engineering <a>Grandes Ecoles</a>. The ENSMN is an establishment of teaching and research in engineering with 1000 students, 60 permanent professors, 400 people in research and R&amp;D including a hundred doctorants.</p>
<p>It is located in the city of <a>Nancy</a>, in the east of <a>France</a>, which gather 48 000 students. Despite its small size (around 140 students in a year, with approximately 20% female and 20% foreign), it is well represented in French industry. </p>
<p>It was created in 1919 on the request of the University of Nancy in order to contribute to the reconstruction of the mining and steel industry in the east of France after <a>World War I</a>. At the end of the 1950s, under the impulse of its then-director Bertrand Schwartz (younger brother of <a>Laurent Schwartz</a>), the school reorganized its curriculum to include a balanced blend of engineering, management and social sciences. At the time, it was an innovative educational model for engineers, that was later extended to other <a>Grandes Ecoles</a>.</p>
<p>Its students for the most part hold management positions in industry and large corporations, but some of them prefer scientific research in any of the French research institutes (such as <a>CNRS</a> or <a>INRIA</a>), or abroad.</p>
<h2>The Civil Engineer of Mines diploma</h2>
<p>The former vocation to train mining engineers evolved in the course of time, because of technological progress and transformations of society. ENSMN has turn into a &quot;generalist&quot; school and proposes to its students the following specialisations for their second year :</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;D&#x00e9;partement Mat&#x00e9;riaux&quot; (materials and mechanics) </li>

  <li>&quot;D&#x00e9;partement Proc&#x00e9;d&#x00e9;s, Energie, Environnement&quot; (energetics and environment)</li>
  <li>&quot;D&#x00e9;partement G&#x00e9;nie industriel&quot; (applied mathematics and industrial engineering)</li>
  <li>&quot;D&#x00e9;partement Information et Syst&#x00e8;mes&quot; (computer science)</li>
