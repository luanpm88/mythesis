<p> The <strong>University of Puerto Rico</strong> (<strong>UPR</strong>) is the <a>state university system</a> of <a>Puerto Rico</a>. The system consists of 11 campuses and has  approximately 64,511 students and 5,300 faculty members. UPR has the largest and most diverse academic offerings in Puerto Rico and the <a>Caribbean</a>, with 472 <a>academic program</a>s and 32 <a>doctoral program</a>s.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1900, at <a>Fajardo</a>, the &quot;Escuela Normal Industrial&quot; (<a>normal school</a>) was established as the first higher education center in <a>Puerto Rico</a>. Its initial enrollment was only 20 students and 5 professors. The following year it was moved to <a>Rio Piedras</a>. On March 12, 1903, a law was passed which officially created the University of Puerto Rico.  That same day, the &quot;Escuela Normal&quot; was proclaimed as the first department of the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>In 1908, the <a>United States government</a> extended financial aid to the University of Puerto Rico as part of the <a>Morill Act</a>, thus making UPR a <a>land-grant university</a>. From these new funds, another campus, &quot;El Colegio de Agricultura,&quot; was established in 1911 at <a>Mayag&#x00fc;ez</a>. One year later, its name was changed to College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or &quot;Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mec&#x00e1;nicas&quot; (CAAM).</p>
<p>In 1913 the departments of <a>Law</a> and <a>Pharmacy</a> were established in Rio Piedras.</p>
<p>In 1918 The <a>University High School</a> (UHS) is funded to provide clinical experience and supervised practice teacher candidates, support staff to teaching and other professionals.</p>
<p>The University Law of 1923, reorganized the University providing administrative independence of the Insular Department of Education, establishing the Board of Trustees and Governing Board, and creates the post of <a>Rector</a> as the principal officer. In 1924 he appointed the first Rector. The enrollment is 1,500 students.</p>
<p>In 1926 is established the College of <a>Business Administration</a> and the School of <a>Tropical Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>In 1927 opened the first graduate program: the <a>Master of Arts</a> in Hispanic Studies.</p>
<p>In 1935 the <a>U.S. Congress</a> extended to Puerto Rico the benefits of the Bankhead-Jones Act, which provided funds for research and construction of more buildings. From 1936 to 1939 were built the main structures of historic quadrangle in Rio Piedras Campus Spanish Renaissance style, including landmark buildings such as The Tower and the University of Puerto Rico Theater.</p>
<p>In 1946 the university received accreditation from the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<p>The expansion continued through the 1950s when many programs flourished in the University. The College of <a>Arts</a> and <a>Sciences</a> and the Nuclear Center were established in <a>University of Puerto Rico at Mayag&#x00fc;ez</a>. The Colleges of <a>Humanities</a>, <a>Natural Sciences</a>, and <a>Social Sciences</a> emerged in <a>University of Puerto Rico at R&#x00ed;o Piedras</a>. The <a>UPR School of Medicine</a>, and <a>UPR School of Odontology</a> were established at <a>San Juan</a> in the <a>University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:LaUniversidad.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[University of Puerto Rico at R&#x00ed;o Piedras|R&#x00ed;o Piedras Campus]] ]] On January 20, 1966, then Governor <a>Roberto S&#x00e1;nchez Vilella</a> signed a law which reorganized the University of Puerto Rico. The most important changes were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Granting complete autonomy to the <a>School of Medicine</a>, which became the <a>Medical Sciences campus</a>.</li>
  <li>Granting complete autonomy to the Mayag&#x00fc;ez and R&#x00ed;o Piedras campuses. The former was renamed the &quot;Recinto Universitario de Mayag&#x00fc;ez&quot; (RUM), a name it keeps to this day. Today, the RUM is well known for its excellent Engineering and Science programs. The Rio Piedras campus is best known for Social and Humanities studies, as well as strong science and business departments. The Rio Piedras Campus has a strong emphasis on doctoral level programs. The <a>University of Puerto Rico Law School</a> is the oldest in Puerto Rico.</li>
</ul>
<p>[[Image:UPRM Portal s.jpg|right|thumb|[[Portico]] of the <a>Mayaguez Campus</a> (RUM)]]</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishing three regional colleges at <a>Arecibo</a>, <a>Cayey</a>, and <a>Humacao</a>.</li>
  <li>In 1969, the regional college at <a>Cayey</a> became an official campus. It was granted complete autonomy in 1982.</li>
  <li>In 1969, the regional college at <a>Ponce</a> was inaugurated.</li>
  <li>In 1970, the regional college at <a>Bayam&#x00f3;n</a> was inaugurated.</li>
  <li>In 1972, the regional college at <a>Aguadilla</a> was inaugurated.</li>
  <li>In 1974, the regional college at <a>Carolina</a> was inaugurated. It was granted complete autonomy in 1999.</li>
  <li>In 1978, the regional college at <a>Utuado</a> was inaugurated.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1979 began the broadcasting of <a>WRTU</a> from Rio Piedras Campus.</p>
<p>In 1993, legislation was approved to create a Board of Trustees for UPR that would take on the duties of university governance that were previously performed by the Council on Higher Education, which remains the top regulatory body for all public and private universities in Puerto Rico.</p>
<h3>UPR Today</h3>
<p>UPR's student body has grown from 173 at its founding in 1903 to almost 70,000 today.  These students are served by 5,300 professors and 14,000 non-teaching staff at eleven campuses throughout Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The Master Plan for the R&#x00ed;o Piedras Campus directs future growth for the University of Puerto Rico&#x2019;s largest campus, a branch expected to serve 27,000 students by 2020. The study reviews existing facilities, identifies attainable development scenarios, and provides phasing and implementation strategies.  The plan also envisions new development including a sport and recreation center; housing for 800 students; and academic and research facilities. The $700 million development plan is currently being implemented.</p>
<p>The Master Plan for the Bayam&#x00f3;n Campus addresses the pressing needs of this important facility of the University of Puerto Rico system. Originally built as a campus of temporary structures to serve 2,500 students, the campus today serves more than 5,000 students, a figure expected to double by the year 2020, and its facilities are decaying and subjected to excessive wear and tear.</p>
<p>On July 2010, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education placed the accreditation of the University on probation citing concerns about the lack governance of the institution. </p>

The <a>Governor of Puerto Rico</a>, with the advice and consent of the <a>Senate of Puerto Rico</a>, appoints the lay representatives. The faculty and student representatives are elected from among the non-university administration members of the University Board. Five of the public interest members are appointed to eight-year terms, three members to six-year terms, and the remaining two members to four-year terms. The faculty and student representatives serve a one-year term. Members representing the public interest may be reappointed to additional terms as long as the total time served does not exceed eight years.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees elects its president from among its members. It is responsible for examining and reviewing the budgetary and institutional development plans of the University,  authorizing the institution of new campus, centers, and other institutional units, appointing the President and chancellors of each autonomous unit, defining rights and duties of various constituents in the institutional community, defining student financial aid standards, preparing an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature on the state of the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
