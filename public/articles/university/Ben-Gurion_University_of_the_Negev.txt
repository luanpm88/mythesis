In 2010, a new student dormitory was funded and built by the Jewish Federation of Toronto, the Rashi Foundation, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the municipality of Eilat. The <a>Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research</a> in Sde Boker awards <a>masters degree</a>s and <a>PhDs</a> in desert-related subjects.</p>
