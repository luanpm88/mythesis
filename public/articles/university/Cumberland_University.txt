<p><strong>Cumberland University</strong> is a private university in <a>Lebanon, Tennessee</a> founded in 1842.  The current campus was built 1892-1896.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|270px|right|Drawing of Cumberland University, c.1858</a> The University was founded in 1842 by the <a>Cumberland Presbyterian Church</a> and received its Tennessee State charter the following year. In 1852 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added a <a>law school</a>, the first in Tennessee and the first west of the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a>, and in 1854 a school of <a>theology</a>.  </p>
<p>The original building, designed by <a>William Strickland</a> in 1844, housed schools of art, law and theology.  The building was burned during the <a>American Civil War</a>. On February 13, 2010, Cumberland University hosted a conference basketball game, and donated half of its gate admissions to Sherry&#x2019;s Run, a non-profit organization created to benefit people with <a>cancer</a>. Also, the Cumberland University cycling team formed its own chapter of local non-profit organization <a>Ride for Reading</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>right|270px|thumb</a> Cumberland football began on October 26, 1894 with a 6-6 tie with Peaboby and finished that first year with a 2-1-1 season record. The early days of Cumberland football were very promising. The pinnacle of the early days of CU football was the 1903 season that began with a 6-0 win over Vanderbilt then a 6-0 loss to Sewanee and continued with a five day road trip that fished with victories over Tennessee (Medical)(86-0), Tulane (28-0), LSU (41-0), Alabama (44-0), and Grant of Chattanooga (92-0). Cumberland would play a postseason game against Coach John Heisman's Clemson team on Thanksgiving Day that ended in a 11-11 tie and gave Coach A.L. Phillips and Cumberland University the Championship of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. That game was the first invitational post-season championship football game in the South. Cumberland also won the Smoky Mountain Conference Championships in 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935. Cumberland's baseball program is probably its best-known athletic team, especially those of the 2004 and 2010 <a>baseball</a> seasons, which won the World Series of the <a>NAIA</a>; the 2006 team was runner-up in this event.  The <a>football</a> team is a member of the <a>Mid-South Conference</a>. In 2008 the Football team won a share of the Mid-South Western Championship.  </p>
<p>Other intercollegiate sports are conducted under the auspices of the <a>TranSouth Athletic Conference</a>, which does not contest football. In addition, Cumberland achieved a top-ten finish at the National Collegiate Cycling Association's National Championship, its women's basketball team finished as NAIA National Tournament Runner-Up in 2007, and Cumberland achieved a National Tournament appearance for the No. 17-ranked Men's Tennis Team in 2007.  The men's basketball team also earned success in the 2008-2009 basketball season earning another trip to the National Tournament.</p>
<p>For the 2008 season, CU's football earned a share of the Mid-South Conference West Division.</p>
