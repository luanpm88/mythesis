<p>The <strong>Jewish Theological Seminary of America</strong> (JTS or JTSA) is one of the academic and spiritual centers of <a>Conservative Judaism</a>, and a major center for academic scholarship in Jewish studies.</p>
<p>JTS operates five schools: <a>Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies</a> (which is affiliated with <a>Columbia University</a> and offers joint/double bachelors degree programs with both Columbia and <a>Barnard College</a>); the Graduate School; the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education; the H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music; and the Rabbinical School.  It also operates a number of research and training institutes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau</h3>
<p> <a>Rabbi</a> <a>Zecharias Frankel</a> (1801&#x2013;1875) at one time was in the traditional wing of the nascent <a>Reform Judaism</a> movement. After the second Reform rabbinic conference (1845, Frankfurt, <a>Germany</a>) he resigned after coming to believe that their positions were excessively radical.  In 1854 he became the head of a new rabbinical school, the <a>Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau</a>.  In his magnum opus <em>Darkhei HaMishnah</em> (Ways of the <a>Mishnah</a>), Frankel amassed scholarly support which showed that <a>Jewish law</a> was not static, but rather had always developed in response to changing conditions.  He called his approach towards <a>Judaism</a> 'Positive-Historical', which meant that one should accept Jewish law and tradition as normative, yet one must be open to changing and developing the law in the same historical fashion that Judaism has always historically developed.</p>
<h3>The Morais era (1886&#x2013;1897)</h3>
<p>About this time in America, Rabbi <a>Sabato Morais</a> championed the reaction to American <a>Reform</a>. At one time Morais had been a voice for moderation within the coalition of Reformers. He had opposed the more radical changes, but was open to moderate changes that would not offend traditional sensibilities. After the Reform movement published the Pittsburgh Platform, Morais recognized the futility of his efforts and began the creation of a new rabbinical school in <a>New York City</a>.  The &quot;Jewish Theological Seminary Association&quot; was founded with Morais as its President in 1886.</p>
<p>Morais was soon joined by <a>Alexander Kohut</a> and <a>Bernard Drachman</a>, both of whom had received <em><a>semicha</a></em> (rabbinic ordination) at Rabbi Frankel's Breslau seminary. They shaped the curriculum and philosophy of the new school after Rabbi Frankel's seminary.  The first graduate to be ordained was Morris Mandel who went to lead <a>Adas Israel congregation (Washington, D.C.)</a>.</p>
<p>Morais served as the president of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America until his death in 1897.</p>
<h3>The Schechter era (1902-1915)</h3>
<p>After Morais's death, the financial position of the association became precarious. In October 1901, a new organization was projected entitled the &quot;Jewish Theological Seminary of America,&quot; with which the association was invited to incorporate. This arrangement was carried into effect April 14, 1902. The new organization was endowed with a fund of over $500,000, and was presented with a suitable building on <a>University Heights</a> by Jacob H. Schiff. It obtained a charter from the state of New York (approved Feb. 20, 1902), &quot;for the perpetuation of the tenets of the <a>Jewish religion</a>, the cultivation of <a>Hebrew literature</a>, the pursuit of <a>Biblical</a> and archeological research, the advancement of Jewish scholarship, the establishment of a library, and the education and training of Jewish rabbis and teachers. It is empowered to grant and confer the degrees of <a>Rabbi</a>, <a>&#x1e24;azan</a>, Master and Doctor of Hebrew Literature, and <a>Doctor of Divinity</a>, and also to award certificates of proficiency to persons qualified to teach in <a>Hebrew schools</a>.&quot; The reorganized seminary was opened on Sept. 15, 1902, in the old building of the Theological Seminary Association at 736 Lexington Avenue. According to <a>David Ellenson</a> and Lee Bycel, &quot;each of these men was a distinguished scholar, and the academic reputation of the Seminary soared with the addition of these men to the faculty.... Schechter was determined to carve out the highest academic reputation for the Seminary.&quot;  The curriculum focused especially on <a>Talmud</a>, <a>legal codes</a>, and classical <a>rabbinic literature</a>, but aside from a little time for a Homiletics class, very little time was spent on practical training for serving in a rabbinical position.  The Teachers Institute offered both undergraduate and graduate degrees.  (Its undergraduate division later evolved into the <a>Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies</a>, and its graduate division evolved into the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education.)</p>
<h3>The Adler era (1915-1940)</h3>
<p>In 1915, Schechter was succeeded by  <a>Cyrus Adler</a>, the President of <a>Dropsie College</a>.  A member of the board with impressive academic qualifications, he was initially seen as an interim replacement for Schechter.  But no better chancellor was found, and Adler went on to serve as President until 1940.</p>
<p>During the 1920's, Adler explored the possibility of a merger with <a>Yeshiva University</a>, but <a>Orthodox</a> leaders of <a>Yeshiva University</a> viewed JTS as insufficiently Orthodox.</p>
<p>New faculty appointed during the early part of Adler's tenure included the Biblical scholar <a>Jacob Hoschander</a>.  In the 1920's, <a>Boaz Cohen</a> and <a>Louis Finkelstein</a>, both of whom were ordained at JTS and completed their doctoral degrees at <a>Columbia University</a>, joined the Talmud faculty.  In the 1930's, Adler appointed <a>H.L. Ginsberg</a>, <a>Robert Gordis</a>, and <a>Alexander Sperber</a> as professors of Bible.  He also gave appointments to <a>Israel Efros</a>, <a>Simon Greenberg</a>, <a>Milton Steinberg</a>, and <a>Ismar Elbogen</a>.  </p>
<p>During his tenure, Adler groomed <a>Louis Finkelstein</a> as his chosen successor.  In 1931, he appointed Finkelstein to a full professorship.  Finkelstein became the Solomon Schechter Profesor of Theology.  In 1937 Adler appointed Finkelstein as Provost.</p>
<p>In 1930 the organization commissioned a new headquarters for 122nd Street and Broadway in a neo-colonial style, with a tower at the corner.  The architects were Gehron, Ross and Alley.</p>
<p>In 1931, the Seminary College of Jewish Studies was established for students who wanted college-level courses in Jewish studies but who were not preparing for teaching careers.  (The Seminary College of Jewish Studies later became the <a>Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies</a>.)</p>
<h3>The Finkelstein era (1940-72)</h3>
<p><a>Louis Finkelstein</a> became Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1940.  During his chancellorship, JTS made significant efforts to engage the American public.  One of its signature programs was a radio and television show called <a>The Eternal Light</a>]. The show aired on Sunday afternoons, featuring well-known Jewish personalities like <a>Chaim Potok</a> and <a>Elie Wiesel</a>. Broadcasts did not involve preaching or prayer, but drew on history, literature and social issues to explore Judaism and Jewish holidays in a manner that was accessible to persons of any faith.  The show continued to run until 1985.</p>
<p>During the 1940s, the Jewish Theological Seminary established <a>Camp Ramah</a> as a tool for furthering <a>Jewish education</a>. The founders envisioned an informal camp setting where Jewish youth would reconnect with the <a>synagogue</a> and Jewish tradition, and a new cadre of American-born Jewish leadership could be cultivated.   The first camp opened in <a>Conover, Wisconsin</a> in 1947.  The program was drawn up by <a>Moshe Davis</a> and <a>Sylvia Ettenberg</a> of the JTS Teachers' Institute.</p>
<p>In 1945, JTS established a new institution, the Leadership Training Fellowship, designed to educate young people within Conservative synagogues and guide them into Jewish public service.</p>
<p>In 1952, the Jewish Theological Seminary opened a new school known as the Cantors Institute.  (The school was later renamed the H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music.)  This was at roughly the same time that the other established American Jewish seminaries, <a>Hebrew Union College</a> and <a>Yeshiva University</a> opened cantorial schools.  Prior to this time, American cantors were often trained in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1950, Finkelstein created the Universal Brotherhood program, which &quot;brought together laymen interested in interpreting the ethical dimensions of Judaism to the wider society.&quot; JTS expanded its public outreach in the 1950s with Finkelstein's development of JTS's Institute for Religious Studies and the establishment of its Herbert H. Lehman Institute of Ethics.</p>
<p>During the Finkelstein era, the Institute for Religious and Social Studies brought together Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish scholars for theological discussions. (In 1986, the name of the institute was changed to the Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies in Finkelstein's honor.)</p>
<p>In 1957, JTS announced plans to build a satellite campus in <a>Jerusalem</a> for JTS rabbinical students studying in Israel.  A building was completed in 1962. (The campus eventually evolved into the home of the <a>Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies</a>.)  In 1962, the seminary also acquired the Schocken Institute for Jewish Research and its library in Jerusalem.</em></p>
<p>In 1968, JTS received a charter from the State of New York to create an Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, which conferred bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.  The Institute was designed as a non-sectarian academic institute which would train future college and university professors.  Its first students enrolled in 1970.  The Institute later evolved into the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary.</p>
<h4>Faculty during the Finkelstein era</h4>
<p>When Finkelstein took office, prominent faculty members included <a>Louis Ginzberg</a>, <a>Alexander Marx</a>, <a>Mordecai Kaplan</a>, <a>H.L. Ginsberg</a>, <a>Robert Gordis</a>, and <a>Boaz Cohen</a>.  </p>
<p>In 1940, Finkelstein made his most significant academic appointment, hiring the prominent Talmud scholar <a>Saul Lieberman</a> as Professor of Palestinian Literature and Institutions.  In 1948, Lieberman became dean of the Rabbinical School.  In 1958, he was named rector of the Seminary.</p>
<h4>Library fire</h4>
<p> In April 1966 JTS's library caught fire. 70,000 books were destroyed, and many others were damaged.</p>
<h3>The Cohen era (1972-1986)</h3>
<p><a>Gerson D. Cohen</a> became Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1972.</p>
<p>Prominent faculty during Cohen's chancellorship included <a>David Weiss Halivni</a> of the Talmud Department and <a>Jos&#x00e9; Faur</a>.  Both of these scholars resigned when the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983.</p>
<p><a>Yochanan Muffs</a>, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1954, was a prominent professor of <a>Bible</a>.  <a>Max Kadushin</a>, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1960, taught ethics and rabbinic thought until his death in 1980.</p>
<p>In 1972, Cohen appointed <a>Avraham Holtz</a> as the dean of academic evelopment.  <a>Neil Gillman</a> served as Dean of the JTS Rabbinical School for much of the Cohen chancellorship. Morton Leifman served as Dean of the Cantors Institute.</p>
<p>Cohen oversaw the appointment of <a>Judith Hauptman</a> as the first female professor of Talmud at JTS.  Hauptman began teaching at JTS in 1973.</p>
<p><a>Joel Roth</a>, who had begun teaching at JTS in 1968, was appointed Associate Professor of Talmud upon completing his Ph.D. at JTS in 1973.  Roth went on to serve as the dean of the Rabbinical School from 1981 to 1984.  He was succeeded by <a>Gordon Tucker</a>, who became dean of the Rabbinical School in 1984.</p>
<p>In June 1973, the Seminary's Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities was granted permission to grant Ph.D. degrees in <a>Jewish History</a>, <a>Bible</a>, <a>Talmud</a>, <a>Jewish Philosophy</a>, and <a>Hebrew</a>.  In 1975, the Seminary replaced the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities with the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which brought together JTS's non-theological academic training programs.  Cohen appointed historian <a>Ismar Schorsch</a> as the first dean of the Graduate School.</p>
<h4>Admission of female students</h4>
<p>Beginning in the 1970's, the topic of women's ordination was regularly discussed at JTS.  Women who unsuccessfully sought admission to the rabbinical school during the 1970's included <a>Susannah Heschel</a>, daughter of JTS faculty member <a>Abraham Joshua Heschel</a>.  After years of discussion, the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983. The first female rabbi to graduate from the school (and the first female Conservative Jewish rabbi in the world) was <a>Amy Eilberg</a>, who graduated and was ordained as a rabbi in 1985. The first class of female rabbis that was admitted to JTS in 1984 included Rabbi <a>Naomi Levy</a>, who later became a best-selling author.  Erica Lipitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel were the first women ordained as cantors by JTS (and the first female Conservative Jewish cantors in the world.) They were both ordained in 1987.</p>
<h3>The Schorsch era (1986&#x2013;2006)</h3>
<p><a>Ismar Schorsch</a> became Chancellor of JTS in 1986.</p>
<p>Among his accomplishments was creating the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education, which was established through an endowmen by <a>William Davidson</a> of Detroit in 1994.</p>
<p>Prominent faculty in the Talmud and Rabbinics department during Schorsch's chancellorship included  <a>Joel Roth</a>, <a>Mayer Rabinowitz</a>, <a>David C. Kraemer</a> and <a>Judith Hauptman</a>.  Hauptman was the first woman appointed to teach Talmud at JTS.  The Bible department included <a>David Marcus</a> and <a>Stephen A. Geller</a>.  The Jewish literature Department included <a>David G. Roskies</a>.  The Jewish history department included  <a>Jack Wertheimer</a> and  <a>Shuly Rubin Schwartz</a>.  The Jewish Philosophy department included <a>Neil Gillman</a> and <a>Shaul Magid</a>.  In 2004, <a>Alan Mittleman</a> joined the Jewish Philosophy department and became head of JTS's Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies.</p>
<p>The number of advanced programs in the Graduate School grew over the course of Schorsch's tenure.  The Graduate School came to describe itself as being &quot;the most extensive academic program in advanced Judaica in North America.&quot;</p>
<p><a>Gordon Tucker</a>'s tenure as dean of the Rabbinical School ended in 1992.  His predecessor, <a>Joel Roth</a>, again became dean, serving in 1992-1993. Roth was succeeded by <a>William Lebeau</a>, who served as dean from 1993-1999.  Lebeau was succeeded by Alan Kensky, and then Lebeau became dean of the Rabbinical School again in June 2002.</p>
<p>In 1998, <a>Henry Rosenblum</a> was appointed Dean of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1998, becoming the first Hazzan to hold that position.  Rosenblum remained in this position until 2010.</p>
<h3>The Eisen era (2007-present)</h3>
<p><a>Arnold Eisen</a>, Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and Religion and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University, took office as Chancellor-elect on July 1, 2006, the day after Schorsch stepped down.  Eisen assumed the position full time on July 1, 2007.</p>
<p>Eisen is the second non-rabbi, after <a>Cyrus Adler</a>, to hold this post. He is also the first person with a <a>social science</a> background to serve as Chancellor; previous chancellors had backgrounds in <a>Jewish</a> <a>history</a> or <a>Talmud</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2007, at the start of Eisen's chancellorship, <a>Daniel S. Nevins</a> was named the Dean of the Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, succeeding <a>Rabbi William Lebeau</a>.  In 2010, <a>Henry Rosenblum</a> left the H.L. Miller Cantorial School as part of JTS's restructuring efforts, and Nevins also became responsible for oversight of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School.</p>
<p>In June 2009, <a>Goldman Sachs</a> executive <a>Abby Joseph Cohen</a> was named Chairman of the Board of JTS, the first woman to hold the position.</p>
<p>Also in 2009, with funding from the Charles H. Revson Foundation and the Booth Ferris Foundation, JTS established The Center for Pastoral Education with the goal of teaching the art of pastoral care to seminary students and ordained clergy of all faiths.  The Center was developed by Rabbi <a>Mychal Springer</a>, formerly an Associate Dean of the Rabbinical School.  Springer became the Center's first director.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a>Tikvah Fund</a> endowed a new institute at JTS, the Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought, which is &quot;devoted to the intellectual encounter between the best sources of Jewish and broader Western reflection on the deepest problems of human life.&quot;  According to the Seminary, &quot;JTS was selected by the Tikvah Fund based on its academic excellence and its mission to advance Jewish life in the modern world.&quot;  <a>Alan Mittleman</a>, Chair of the Department of Jewish Thought, was appointed as its director. </p>
<p>Professor <a>Burton L. Visotzky</a> was appointed to replace Mittleman as director of the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies.  His early work as director of the Finkelstein Institute focused on Muslim-Jewish dialogue.  In October 2010, a group of prominent Muslim and Jewish scholars and leaders, joined by the heads of several Christian seminaries, met at JTS for two days to discuss and compare the situations of Islam and Judaism in America.</p>
<h4>Admission of LGBT students</h4>
<p>Since March 2007, JTS has accepted openly gay students into their rabbinical and cantorial programs (the Seminary's other three schools upheld such non-discrimination policies prior to this date). A survey conducted prior to the decision indicated that 58% of the rabbinical student body supported this change. The school issued a press release announcing the new admission policy, without taking a stance on same-sex unions. JTS marked the first year anniversary of the change with a special program. Some students who opposed the change in admission policy said they felt excluded from the day's program because it did not sufficiently recognize the pluralism in the student body.</p>
<h4>New Mission</h4>
<p>In May 2010, the Jewish Theological Seminary under <a>Arnold Eisen</a>'s leadership unveiled the following mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Jewish Theological Seminary of America is a preeminent institution of Jewish higher education that integrates rigorous academic scholarship and teaching with a commitment to strengthening Jewish tradition, Jewish lives, and Jewish communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>JTS articulates a vision of Judaism that is learned and passionate, pluralist and authentic, traditional and egalitarian; one that is thoroughly grounded in Jewish texts, history, and practices, and fully engaged with the societies and cultures of the present. Our vision joins faith with inquiry; the covenant of our ancestors with the creative insights of today; intense involvement in the society and State of Israel with devotion to the flowering of Judaism throughout the world; service to the Jewish community, as well as to all of the communities of which Jews are a part: our society, our country, and our world.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>JTS serves North American Jewry by educating intellectual and spiritual leaders for Conservative Judaism and the vital religious center, training rabbis, cantors, scholars, educators, communal professionals, and lay activists who are inspired by our vision of Torah and dedicated to assisting in its realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Seminary sees its mission statement as based on six principles:  With the new mission statement introduced by Chancellor Arnold Eisen (2007-), the school has positioned itself as serving both &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; and &quot;the vital religious center.&quot;</p>
<p>As of 2010, JTS's website describes JTS as &quot;the academic and spiritual center of Conservative Judaism worldwide.&quot;   Others describe it as &quot;the academic and spiritual centre of Conservative Judaism in the United States.&quot;  A second important center for Conservative Judaism in the United States is the <a>Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies</a> in California, founded by graduates of JTS in 1996.</p>
<h2>Current educational programs</h2>
<h3>Rabbinical School</h3>
<p>The Rabbinical School describes itself as offering &quot;an intensive program of study, personal growth, and spiritual development that leads to <a>rabbinic</a> ordination and a career of service to the Jewish community.&quot;</p>
<p>As of 2010, the rabbinical school requires five or six years of study.  Its curriculum requires extensive study of <a>Talmud</a>, <a>midrash</a>, <a>Bible</a>, <a>Jewish history</a>, <a>Hebrew</a> language, and various professional skills.  Students are required to spend the second year of the program at the <a>Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies</a> in <a>Jerusalem</a>.  </p>
<p>Students must choose a field of concentration during their studies.  Concentrations include:</p>

<h3>Cantorial School</h3>
<p>The Cantorial School describes itself as training &quot;select advanced students as <a>hazzanim</a> (cantors) for congregational service or as teachers of Jewish music, choral directors, composers, or research scholars.&quot;</p>
<p>The school is technically divided into two parts: the entity formally known as the <em>H. L. Miller Cantorial School</em> invests students as <a>hazzanim</a>, while the entity known as the <em>College of Jewish Music</em> awards the Master's degree in Sacred Music.  All students in the Cantorial School are enrolled in both programs simultaneously.</p>
<p>At present, the first year of cantorial school at JTS is generally spent in <a>Israel</a>.  The curriculum during the five years focuses on three main areas: general <a>music</a>, <a>Jewish music</a> and <a>Jewish text study</a>.</p>
