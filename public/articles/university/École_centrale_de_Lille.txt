<p></p>
<p>Located in the campus of the University of <a>Lille</a>  in <a>France</a>, the <strong>&#x00c9;cole Centrale de Lille</strong> is a renowned Graduate Engineering school, with roots back to 1854 as the <em>Ecole des arts industriels et des mines de Lille</em>, re-organised in 1872 as the <em>Institut industriel du Nord</em>.  It is one of the <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>s.</p>
<p>Its different curricula lead to the following French &amp; European degrees :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ing&#x00e9;nieur Centralien de Lille</strong> (Centralien Graduate engineer Master degree)</li>
  <li><strong>Masters</strong> Research &amp; Doctorat (<strong>PhD</strong> doctorate studies)</li>
  <li><strong>Specialized Masters</strong> (Mast&#x00e8;re MS Sp&#x00e9;cialis&#x00e9;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Academic activities and industrial applied research are performed mainly in French and English languages. Students from a dozen of nationalities participate to the different curricula at Ecole Centrale de Lille.</p>
<p>The 1300 graduate engineer students at Ecole Centrale de Lille live in dedicated residential buildings nearby research labs and metro public transports on a campus that is shared with 20,000 students from <a>Lille University of Science and Technology</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lille was founded as <em>&#x00c9;cole des arts industriels et des mines</em> de <a>Lille</a> in 1854, the same year when <a>Louis Pasteur</a> became the dean of the <em><a>Facult&#x00e9; des sciences de Lille</a></em> and pioneered applied research with industry cooperations, with support of scientists such as <a>Charles Fr&#x00e9;d&#x00e9;ric Kuhlmann</a>. Between 1854 and 1871, students attending the two-year curriculum grew to 90 per annum. Baccalaureate was a prerequisite to admission to the engineering school.  </p>
<p>In 1872 lectures and research activities in the engineering school were reorganised into a three-year curriculum and developed within its <em>Institut industriel du Nord</em>, with a focus on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A stress on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science, supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics and telecommmunications. </p>
<p>Since early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a <a>classe pr&#x00e9;paratoire aux grandes &#x00e9;coles</a> or similar undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lille was originally located in Lille central district from 1854 to 1875. Larger buildings with dedicated laboratories were inaugurated in 1875 nearby the <em>Facult&#x00e9; des sciences de Lille</em>. It then moved in 1968 in the modern campus of <a>Lille University of Science and Technology</a>, in the south-east suburb of Lille.</p>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<p><a>300px|thumb|right|&#x00c9;cole Centrale de Lille - Administration hall</a> <a>300px|thumb|right|&#x00c9;cole Centrale de Lille - Tower E</a> Admission to the <strong>Centralien engineering Programme</strong> implemented at Ecole Centrale de Lille is possible after two/three year scientific undergraduate studies and requires success to either: </p>
<ul>
  <li>an admission exam for Bachelors of Sciences : CASTing - Concours d'Admission sur Titre Ing&#x00e9;nieur (2-year curriculum)</li>
  <li>a French nationwide selective exam with <em>numerus clausus</em> : concours Centrale-Supelec (3-year curriculum including at least 2 years in France)</li>
  <li>a selective application as per <a>TIME</a> double degrees procedures applicable in Europe (2+2-year curriculum, including 2 years in France)</li>
  <li>a selective application  as per <a>TIME Overseas</a> double degree procedures applicable for selected Universities and Institutes of Technology  in Brasil, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (2+2-year curriculum, including 2 years in France)</li>
  <li>a selective application as per <a>IMCC</a> procedure for one-semester or one-year accredited post-graduate study period in France and USA (1 year curriculum)</li>
  <li>a specific application process  for other international students presented by their originating University.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Centralien Programme</strong> typically lasts three years and results in a Master degree, augmented with international experience. Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 <a>ECTS</a> credit in the European education system.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>However, graduate students enrolled in the TIME double degree procedure are required to spend two-years at Ecole Centrale de Lille and spend two years in the TIME-partner institute for a total of four years resulting in a double master degree . </p>
<p>Not to mention that 18% students attending courses at  Ecole Centrale de Lille are international students, all students enrolled in the Centralien Programme have an international exposure with opportunities to perform industry training and internship in entreprises worldwide, study abroad for 1 year in selected partner institutes providing Master (M2) courses, or be part of the 2+2 year TIME double degree programme.</p>
<p>In addition to the Centralien Programme, Ecole Centrale de Lille provides a range of Master's degree cursus in science and engineering that are opened to applicants who have completed their undergraduate studies in other institutes. Admission to Masters' second-year research cursus (M2R) is also possible for applicants who have performed their Master's first year (M1) in another institute and wish to focus on a research topic associated to Centrale Lille research labs.</p>
<p>Admission to one of the 6 <strong>Masters</strong> (M1+M2 or M2) from Ecole Centrale de Lille is possible upon an application assessment process based on academic criteria. Note that <strong>Masters/Research</strong> (M2R) workload is 60 <a>ECTS</a> credits and may be the starting point for doctorate studies. These 6 Masters and a larger number of  Masters (M2) from other <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>s and from partner institutes are also possible as electives for a double degree alongside the <strong>Centralien Programme</strong>. </p>
<p>Admission to one of the 6 <a>Specialized Masters</a> for Master-level specialization and continuing education in specific engineering and management fields is possible upon application assessment based on candidate profile. Prerequisite to apply for this specialized curriculum is to already hold a Master or an equivalent postgraduate degree in a different scientific field. MS lectures at Ecole Centrale de Lille are taught in English  and/or in French . MS workload is 75 <a>ECTS</a> credits. <a>thumb|right|300px|Centrale Lille - Rez</a></p>
