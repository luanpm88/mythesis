<p>Each faculty regulates different undergraduate degrees accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yale-China Chinese Language Center</h3>
<p> The Yale-China Chinese Language Center (CLC), formerly New Asia - Yale-in-China Chinese Language Center, was founded in 1963 under the joint auspices of <a>New Asia College</a> and the <a>Yale-China Association</a>. The Center became part of Chinese University in 1974 and has been responsible for the teaching of one language education (<a>Putonghua</a> and <a>Cantonese</a>) of University students as well as other Putonghua and Cantonese learners. Courses are offered in two different series, namely for non-native speakers and for native speakers of Chinese. All series have different levels in order to meet the needs and aptitude of students.  </p>

The university connects itself with the other districts of the city via the <a>Mass Transit Railway</a> and the <a>Hong Kong bus system</a>. Buses and trains stop by Chung Chi College.</p>

<h3>Hostels and dorms</h3>
<p>Due to high demand, only about half of CU students are offered a dormitory room. There are a total of 23 dormitory halls, each of which belongs to one of the four colleges.  There are also six additional halls for graduate students.</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Goddess of Democracy</h3>
<p> On 29 May 2010, when the CUHK student union sought to permanently locate a 'Goddess of Democracy' statue on campus, the administrative and planning committee of the University convened an emergency meeting for 1 June, chaired by incumbent Vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau, to consider the request. The application was turned down; the reason provided was the need for the University to maintain political neutrality. Staff and students objected to the refusal, however, accusing the committee of self-censorship; students declared they were prepared for a stand-off against the University, saying they would ensure the statues were accommodated on campus &quot;at all costs&quot;. <a>240px|thumb|left|Students attend an open-air meeting at the university campus|alt=B/W image of hundreds of people orderly sitting outdoors, with an unfurled banner</a> A student meeting was convened, and student union President Eric Lai told 2,000 attendees that the University officials should apologise for their opposition of the art display. On 4 June, bowing to public outcry and student pressure, the University relented, and allowed the statue on campus. Outgoing Vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau defended the committee's decision as &quot;collective and unanimous&quot; after &quot;detailed consideration,&quot; citing the unanimous vote of the administrative and planning committee, and he disagreed with Sung's characterization of the management team.  While the vote was unanimous, however, Sung stated that he had suggested the wording of the decision include the qualification that the committee &quot;had not reached a consensus.&quot;  </p>
<p>The student union said the two professors should have communicated to reach a consensus, and that Lau's reply &quot;failed to explain why the school used political neutrality as a reason to reject the statue.&quot;</p>
