<p> <strong>Saint Peter's College</strong> is a private, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>college</a> in the <a>United States</a>. Located in <a>Jersey City</a>, <a>New Jersey</a>, it was founded in 1872 by the <a>Society of Jesus</a>.  Today, Saint Peter's College is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>.  Saint Peter's College offers over 33 majors to more than 3,200 <a>undergraduate</a> and 500 <a>graduate</a> students.  Its college <a>mascot</a> is the <a>Peacock</a> (the women's sports teams are called the <a>Peahen</a>s), and its sports teams play in the <a>Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference</a>, of which it is a founding member.</p>
<p>The school is located on a 15 acre (61,000&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) campus just south of <a>Journal Square</a>, and is 2&nbsp;mi (3&nbsp;km) west of <a>New York City</a>.  Evening and weekend classes are offered in Jersey City, <a>Englewood Cliffs</a>, and <a>South Amboy</a>.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><strong>Saint Peter&#x2019;s College</strong>, inspired by its Jesuit, Catholic identity, commitment to individual attention and grounding in the liberal arts, educates a diverse community of learners in undergraduate, graduate and professional programs to excel intellectually, lead ethically, serve compassionately and promote justice in our ever-changing urban and global environment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was chartered in 1872 and enrolled its first students in 1878 at Warren Street, in Jersey City, on the present site of the <a>St. Peter's Preparatory School</a>.  In September 1918, the college was closed, along with several other Jesuit colleges and high schools, because of declining enrollment in the face of <a>World War I</a>.  Although the war ended only two months after its closing, and despite clamoring from alumni, it took until 1930 to re-open the college.  The college was temporarily located on Newark Avenue, before moving in 1936 to its current location on Hudson (now <a>Kennedy</a>) Boulevard, between Montgomery Street and Glenwood Avenue.</p>
<p>Civil rights have had a long tradition at the college.  It was first desegregated in 1936, when the college admitted its first black student.  The college granted an honorary <a>Doctor of Divinity</a> degree to <a>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in 1965, and the next year it became <a>coeducation</a>al.</p>
<p>The college has made an effort to reach out into the New Jersey suburbs, with a satellite campus at <a>Englewood Cliffs</a> opened in 1975 and an extension at <a>South Amboy</a>'s McCarrick High School opened in 2003.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen much construction for the college.  In 1975, the college constructed the Yanitelli Recreational Life Center, a sports complex.  Beginning with the 1983 acquisition of its first residence hall, the college has converted four apartment buildings to dormitory use, and constructed two brand new dormitories.</p>
<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p>Gannon Hall, the science building and one of the first structures on campus, recently underwent an $8.2 million renovation, bringing it up to state-of-the-art standards.</p>
<p>In 2004, the long-awaited pedestrian bridge over Kennedy Boulevard linked the East Campus and the West Campus.  As of 2006, the college is embarking on a $50 million capital campaign, designed to raise funds for a new student center.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2006, sitting college President James N. Lougran, <a>S.J.</a> was found dead in his home.  On May 10, 2007, the Board of Trustees appointed Eugene J. Cornacchia, Ph.D., as the 22nd President of Saint Peter's College. Dr. Cornacchia is the first <a>layperson</a> to serve as President of the 135 year-old Catholic, Jesuit  College in Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2008, Saint Peter's was awarded a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to create the Center for Microplasma Science and Technology.  This grant allowed the college to expand upon its 20 years of studying <a>microplasma</a> as part of its research on water purifiers in conjunction with <a>United Water</a>.  Saint Peter's graduates U.S. Senator <a>Robert Menendez</a> and U.S. Representative <a>Albio Sires</a> helped secure the $2 million grant.</p>
<p>On the day after his narrow defeat in the <a>2008 New Hampshire Presidential primary election</a>, Democratic Presidential candidate <a>Barack Obama</a> held a rally at the college's <a>Yanitelli Center</a> .</p>
<h2>Student clubs and activities</h2>
<p>Saint Peter's College has numerous clubs and organizations that participate in a broad range of activities. Saint Peter's College has over 50 active student-run organizations. Ms. Jan M. Reimer, an alumna of the college, is the current Director of Student Activities.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>150px|thumb|right</a>  Competing in the <a>Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference</a> (MAAC), the college fields 17 <a>athletic</a> teams. The men's teams are known as the Peacocks, and the women's teams are the Peahens; Saint Peter's is the only <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> institution with this <a>mascot</a>. The <a>baseball</a>, <a>softball</a> and <a>soccer</a> teams play at Joseph J. Jaroschak Field, in <a>Lincoln Park</a>. All other teams play at the <a>The Victor R. Yanitelli, S.J. Recreational Life Center</a>, located on campus. The school also uses the <a>Jersey City Armory</a> for some events. On June 14, 2007, it was announced that the football team would be disbanded.</p>
<p><a>Basketball</a> has long been the most popular sport at the college. Under legendary <a>coach</a> Don Kennedy, the men's team gained national attention by defeating heavily favored and nationally ranked <a>Duke University</a> in the 1968 <a>NIT</a> quarterfinals, en route to a fourth-place finish.</p>
<p>Saint Peter's has won the <a>MAAC men's basketball championship</a> and the accompanying automatic bid to the <a>NCAA tournament</a> twice (1991 and 1995) and has appeared in the <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> (NIT) 12 times (1957, 1958, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987 and 1989). The women's basketball team has won seven MAAC championships and automatic bids to the <a>NCAA tournament</a> (1982, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002); it also won the MAAC championship in 1983 and 1984, years when the MAAC champion did not receive an automatic NCAA tournament berth.</p>
<p>In recent years the basketball program has seen a resurgence, owing much to the success of <a>Keydren &quot;Kee-Kee&quot; Clark</a> '05.  In 2004 and 2005, Clark led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion.  On March 4, 2006, Clark became only the seventh NCAA player to score more than 3,000 points in his career; on the next day, he passed <a>Hersey Hawkins</a> to become the sixth-leading scorer of all time.  At the time of his final game on March 6, 2006, Clark held the NCAA all-time record for 3-point shots, with 435. A second fourth-year student and a forward on the basketball team, George Jefferson, died on June 21, 2005, due to a previously undiagnosed heart condition.</p>
<p>[[Image:YanitelliCenterOutside.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Yanitelli Center]], Home of the Peacocks/Peahens]] <a>John Dunne</a> was named the 14th head coach in Saint Peter&#x2019;s College men&#x2019;s basketball history on May 24, 2006. On November 25, 2007, the Peacocks defeated <a>Rutgers University</a> 65-58 at the Jersey City Armory. This victory was Saint Peter's first win against a <a>Big East Conference</a> opponent since defeating <a>Seton Hall University</a> at the <a>Meadowlands</a> in 1995.</p>
<p>The men's soccer team has also enjoyed some success of late. The Peacocks were crowned the 2003 MAAC Men's Soccer Champions after defeating Loyola College (Maryland), 2-1. In 2006 the Peacocks returned to the MAAC Men's Soccer Championship finals where they were outlasted by Fairfield University, 1-0. The Peacocks again returned to the MAAC Men's Soccer Championship Finals in 2007, where they fell to Loyola College, 1-0. In 2007, the men's team earned a place in the 2007 NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament with the first at-large nomination in school history. The Peacocks met the University of Virginia in the first Round of play at Charlottesville, Virginia. Saint Peter's lost by a score of 3-1. In 2010 Saint Peter's College Mens Soccer term earned their 2nd MAAC Championship title defeating Iona College 2-1.</p>
<p>The women's <a>bowling</a> team is one of the most successful programs at the school, winning its first-ever championship title in 2009.</p>
<p>The <a>golf</a> team enjoys access to the prestigious <a>Liberty National Golf Club</a> on the beautiful Jersey City waterfront &#x2014; home to The Barclays 2009, first stage of the PGA Tour Playoffs for the FedEx Cup. Liberty National is noted as a unique course because of its proximity to and panoramic views of both the Statue of Liberty and Manhattan.</p>
<h2>Alma mater</h2>
<p>The Alma Mater was composed by Frederick Joslyn, with lyrics by Richard I. Nevin.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hail, Alma Mater, deathless Saint Peter's. Our loving hearts acclaim thy resurrected name.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor war nor time has power to bind thee, thine is the spirit proud and free. And as year on year comes winging, we will still be singing praises to thy fame.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hail, Alma Mater, hallowed Saint Peter's. With each new day we see how much we owe to thee</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Truth is our guide, we shall not wander, God is our strength, we shall not fail. And our love will ever bind us, so that death will find us thine eternally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<h2>Peacock mascot</h2>
<p><a>150px|thumb|right|</a> As mentioned above, Saint Peter's College is the only <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> institution whose <a>mascot</a> is the <a>peacock</a>. This choice was made for several reasons. Primarily, the land on which Saint Peter's now stands was once owned by a man named <a>Michael Pauw</a>, whose last name means &quot;peacock&quot; in <a>Dutch</a>. His extensive holdings included most of <a>Hudson County</a> and were part of the <a>Pavonia, New Netherland</a> settlement.</p>
<p>In pagan mythology, the peacock is considered to be a symbol of rebirth, much like the <a>phoenix</a>. For Saint Peter's, it is a reference to the closing and reopening of the college in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>At one point in the 1960s, live peacocks roamed the campus.  Many institutions within the college derive their name from the peacock:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The school newspaper is titled the <em>Pauw Wow</em>.</li>
  <li>The literary magazine is titled the <em>Pavan</em>.</li>
  <li>The school's yearbook is titled the <em>Peacock Pie</em>.</li>
  <li>The drama society calls itself <em>Argus Eyes</em>, in reference to <a>Argus &quot;Panoptes&quot;</a>, who, according to <a>Greek mythology</a>, had his 100 eyes preserved by <a>Hera</a> in the tail of the peacock.</li>
  <li>One of the major dining facilities is named the Pavonia Room.</li>
</ul>
