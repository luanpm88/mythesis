<p><a>Brown University</a>, which has an exchange program with Keio, and <a>The Japan Times</a> have stated they consider it to be one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. It ranked 11th in the world in 2009 according to a study by &#x00c9;cole des Mines de Paris. </p>
<h2>History and reputation</h2>
<p>Keio traces its history to 1858 when <a>Fukuzawa Yukichi</a>, who had studied the Western educational system at <a>Brown University</a> in the <a>United States</a>, started to teach Dutch while he was a guest of Okudaira family. In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education.  While Kei&#x014d;'s initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as an influential leader in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008. </p>
<p>Keio university was visited by <a>Albert Einstein</a> where he presented a lecture on the special theory of relativity in 1922. Keio's School of Medicine has long-standing research links with the <a>Harvard</a> Medical School. Keio University has joined the <a>MIT</a> and the French <a>INRIA</a> in hosting the international World W3C. Keio has one of the largest financial endowments of any Japanese university. In 2009, Keio University was selected as a &quot;Global 30&quot; university, a government program &quot;which is aimed at elevating... international competitiveness among the world's top universities and at creating an attractive environment for overseas students, while fostering students and researchers capable of playing active international roles.&quot; </p>
<p>Keio is one of the world-class research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities, making it one of the primary engines for advanced research in Japan  In 2006, a Keio undergraduate had a paper published in the research journal <em>Science</em>, one of the most prestigious academic journals in the world as the first author.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p><a>Edward Bramwell Clarke</a> and <a>Tanaka Ginnosuke</a> first introduced <a>Rugby union</a> to Japanese students at Keio University. (The game had been played in the treaty ports of <a>Yokohama</a> and <a>Kobe</a> before that, but not between Japanese teams.)</p>
<p>The interest of Keio's students in <a>baseball</a> stretches back to the early years of the 20th century; and the history of exhibition games was reported internationally. In 1913, an American professional team made of players from the New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox played the Keio team in an exhibition game.  In a 1932 exhibition game, the Keio team beat the University of Michigan team which was then touring Japan. Keio's baseball team plays in the <a>Tokyo Big6 Baseball League</a> (six prominent universities in the Tokyo area).</p>
