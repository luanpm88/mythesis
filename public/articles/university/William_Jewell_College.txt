<p><strong>William Jewell College</strong> is a private, four-year <a>liberal arts college</a> of 1,050 undergraduate students located in <a>Liberty, Missouri</a>, <a>U.S.</a> It was founded in 1849 by members of the Missouri <a>Baptist</a> Convention and other civic leaders, including <a>Robert S. James</a>, a Baptist minister and father of the infamous Frank and Jesse James. It was associated with the Missouri Baptist Convention for over 150 years, and it has a large collection of materials from Baptist history.  Well respected in its field, Jewell was chosen by <a>Time Magazine</a> as its 2001 <em>Liberal Arts College of the Year</em>.  The school maintained ties to the Missouri Baptist Convention until severing them over a dispute concerning <a>evolution</a> and <a>homosexuality</a> in 2003. Enrollment at William Jewell College has fluctuated recently because of efforts to re-brand the College in a more secular image, increase diversity and raise the quality of incoming students.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p><a>thumb|125px|William Jewell</a> The college is named after Dr. <a>William Jewell</a>, who in 1849 donated $10,000 to start a <a>Baptist</a> school. It was the first four-year men's college west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.  Jewell, who was from <a>Columbia, Missouri</a>, had wanted the school built in <a>Boonville, Missouri</a>.  However, Liberty resident <a>Alexander William Doniphan</a> argued that donated undeveloped land in Liberty would be more valuable than the proposed developed land in Boonville, and Liberty was eventually chosen.  Judge J.T.V. Thompson donated the hilltop land on which the campus sits.  In the <a>American Civil War</a> during the <a>Battle of Liberty</a>, the main building on campus, Jewell Hall, was used as a <a>hospital</a>, infirmary, and stables for the <a>United States Army</a>.  Union troops were buried on the campus.  After the war, two sons of co-founder <a>Robert S. James</a>, <a>Jesse James</a> and <a>Frank James</a>, staged the first daylight <a>bank robbery</a> at the <a>Clay County Savings Association</a> four blocks west of the campus the <a>James-Younger gang</a> inadvertently killed George Wymore, a student who was across the street from the bank.</p>
<h3>Gano Chapel</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Gano Chapel on Jewell's Quad</a> In 1926, the <a>John Gano</a> chapel was built, based on a donation from Gano's great-granddaughter, Elizabeth Price, who lived in Kansas City. Price gave the money for the chapel with provisions that the chapel be named for Gano, that the school take over maintenance of the Gano family cemetery between Liberty and Excelsior Springs, and that it hang a painting of Gano <a>baptizing</a> <a>George Washington</a> in the <a>Potomac River</a> during the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>.  The college says the painting is one of the school's most popular tourist destinations and takes no stance on whether the baptism of Washington (who was Episcopalian) actually took place.  The story is rejected by many historians who question whether Gano was even stationed with Washington and note there is nothing in his Gano's personal correspondence about the event.</p>
<p>Other Gano artifacts in the chapel include a painting depicting Gano leading the troops in a prayer of Thanksgiving in 1783 at the conclusion of the Revolutionary war and a sword that Washington was said to have given Gano (which in turn had been given to Washington by <a>Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette</a>).</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Curry Library and Yates-Gill College Union on Jewell's Quad</a> According to the school's website, <a>Luciano Pavarotti</a> made his international recital debut at the campus in 1973.  Perspiring before the debut, he asked for a handkerchief and only a white dinner napkin could be found. The napkin became a signature part of Pavarotti's act.  During that time, William Jewell College also played host to the <a>Kansas City Chiefs</a> as their pre-season <a>NFL Training Camp</a>.  However, their training camp was moved to <a>River Falls, Wisconsin</a> in 1990.</p>
<p>On May 4, 2003, at the height of a debate over whether the Missouri Baptist Convention should continue to fund the school, an F2 <a>tornado</a> that was part of the <a>May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence</a> hit the campus damaging several buildings, ripping roofs off dormitories, and separating the landmark clock tower from the chapel. Although damage was estimated at between $15 and $20 million, nobody at the school was killed or injured. Despite this disaster, the Baptist Convention followed through on its threat and pulled the financing. Nonetheless, classes resumed the next fall with the school relying on other private sources.</p>
<p>Its library included at one time the 5,103 volume library of the Baptist preacher <a>Charles Spurgeon</a>. The college bought the library from Spurgeon's estate for $500 in 1906.  The Collection was sold in 2006 to <a>Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary</a> in Kansas City.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, President David Sallee announced that the school's endowment lost 35% of its value due to the stock market collapse. As a result, President Sallee implemented several cuts to the College's programs and resources aimed at reducing costs by $2 million over the next two years.</p>
<h2>Academic</h2>
<p>William Jewell College is also known for its distinctive Oxbridge Honors Program.  Oxbridge majors take tutorials in their major, study abroad in <a>Oxford</a> or <a>Cambridge</a>, and take comprehensive exams during their senior year.  The college has also sent many students and professors to the <a>University of Evansville</a>'s satellite campus at <a>Harlaxton Manor</a>.</p>
<p>William Jewell is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>William Jewell College's official mascot is the Cardinal. Its athletic teams compete in the <a>Heart of America Conference</a> of the <a>NAIA</a>.  Jewell's basketball team competes as a NAIA Division I school; the NAIA divides the sport into Division I and Division II categories. William Jewell College is currently in the process of transitioning to the <a>NCAA</a> and will become a full member of the <a>NCAA Division II</a> in the 2011-2012 school year.  They will join the <a>Great Lakes Valley Conference</a> at that time if their candidancy years are successfully completed and are then invited to join the NCAA at the Division II level, as that is the NCAA's process.  William Jewell football teams lead the NAIA in total wins.</p>
