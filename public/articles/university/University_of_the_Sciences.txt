<p>The <strong>University of the Sciences (USciences)</strong>, officially known as The University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP), located in <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in <a>pharmacy</a> and a variety of other health-related disciplines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For the 2010-2011 school year, the University officially unveiled a new name and logo: USciences: University of the Sciences.</p>
<h3>Shaping the profession of pharmacy</h3>
<p><a>William Procter, Jr.</a>, often described as &quot;the father of American pharmacy,&quot; was a PCP professor from 1846&#x2013;1874, as well as serving as an officer of the board. He was instrumental in the founding of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the national professional society of pharmacists, which was founded and organized in Philadelphia in 1852. It is now called the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the first established and largest professional association of pharmacists in the United States. The more than 50,000 members of APhA include practicing pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians, and others interested in advancing the profession.</p>
<p>In 1868, John Maisch, PCP professor (1866&#x2013;1893) and dean (1879&#x2013;1893), proposed the creation of a pharmaceutical board to be appointed by the governor of each state and established the term &#x201c;registered pharmacist.&#x201d; He shared his proposal with each governor, and by 1878 nine states had adopted pharmacy laws which licensed pharmacists. Every state now, of course, has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the practice of pharmacy.</p>
<p>Started in 1820, the <a>United States Pharmacopeia</a> laid down the standards for manufacturing drugs. For more than a hundred years, PCP faculty members were instrumental in its development, serving as editors throughout many editions. </p>
<p>In 1825, the first periodical in the United States devoted to the art and science of pharmacy, the <em>American Journal of Pharmacy,</em> was published by PCP.</p>
<p>PCP professors Franklin Bache and George B. Wood compiled a comprehensive commentary on drugs, <em>The Dispensatory of the United States of America.</em> First published in 1833, the <em>Dispensatory</em> was authored and edited for more than a hundred years by successive generations of faculty at the college.</p>
<p>In 1885, PCP professor Joseph P. Remington published <em>The Practice of Pharmacy,</em> which soon became established as the standard text in the field. Later renamed <em>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,</em> this comprehensive reference work remains widely used throughout the world and is still compiled by the university. University of the Sciences is in final preparation for the 21st edition, which is also published in Spanish.</p>

<h3>Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy</h3>
<p>The Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy  is an integral part of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.  The center&#x2019;s mission is to serve as an educational, cultural, and research resource for the university, pharmacy professionals, historians, and the general public through its collections of artifacts, objects, and records representative of all aspects of pharmacy, including the pharmacy college&#x2019;s history. Through changing exhibitions, tours, and programs, the center aims to deepen appreciation of the past, present, and future significance of the pharmacy industry in the broader social context and in the development of American life, especially in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding region.</p>
<h3>Campus expansion program</h3>
<p>The university doubled the size of the campus in 1998 when it acquired an adjacent, vacant industrial site.  (This site was formerly the home of the original Breyers Ice Cream factory which closed its Philadelphia operation in the early 1990s.)    BLT Architects designed the Athletic and Recreation Center (ARC) in August 2003.  BLT Architects channeled the ambience of a traditional college campus through this building.  ARC is situated between a new campus quad and a commuter parking lot.  Its design features a 1,000 seat event gymnasium, recreation gymnasium, natatorium, fitness areas, and a 1/10 mile indoor track.  The McNeil Science and Technology Center (McNeil STC) was officially dedicated September 2006.  Additional building projects are being planned for the years to come.</p>
<p>The McNeil Science and Technology Center houses many new classrooms, computer research rooms, and teaching laboratories as well as the undergraduate and graduate programs in biology, bioinformatics/computer science, and math/physics/statistics.  The centerpiece of the center is a 400-seat auditorium equipped with modern audio/visual equipment.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>University of the Sciences in Philadelphia has 23 majors for students to choose from including two recently introduced programs, Humanities and Science and Fitness and Health Management.  Students will engage in the study of both Humanities and Science, with courses directed to higher studies of their choice including medical school, law school, and biomedical writing.</p>
<p>In the Fitness and Health Management program, students will be provided a foundation for graduate degrees or careers in athletic training, sports administration, fitness/wellness, health education and other related fields that combine health sciences with exercise physiology, kinesiology, and sports psychology. Rather than focusing on illness and pathology, the curriculum focuses on the prevention of health problems.</p>
<p>University of the Sciences also offers an online Masters program in Biomedical Writing.  This is the one of the few graduate programs in the United States that is geared towards preparing and training medical writers in preclinical and clinical research, medical communications, journalism, and medical publications.</p>

<h3>The J.W. England Library</h3>
<p>The Library of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia was formed in 1821 at the second meeting of the Board of Trustees. Since its beginnings, the library has been considered one of the premier collections of pharmaceutical science in the country. In 1973, the library moved into its present quarters, the free-standing Joseph W. England Library. Small but specialized, the collection is particularly strong in pharmacy, pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics, and foreign drug compendia. Other areas of specialization include toxicology, pharmacology, and physical therapy. Contained in the Leopold Helfand Rare Book and Archives Room is a collection of seventeenth and eighteenth century botanicals, including a book once owned by Isaac Newton. Since the university and its graduates were fundamental to the building of the United States pharmaceutical industry, the university archives are of interest to anyone researching the origins of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
