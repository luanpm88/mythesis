<p>Founded in 1974, the &#x00c9;cole de technologie sup&#x00e9;rieure is part of the <a>Universit&#x00e9; du Qu&#x00e9;bec</a> system. Specialized in applied teaching in engineering and technology transfer to companies, it teaches engineers and researchers who are recognized for their practical and innovative approach. In any given year, 25% of all engineers receiving a diploma from an engineering school or faculty in the province of Qu&#x00e9;bec graduate from the ETS. Hence, it is ranked first in Quebec and third in Canada for the total number of engineering diplomas awarded annually.</p>
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Building A at night</a> The ETS is currently located at 1100 <a>Notre-Dame Street West</a> in Montreal, the site of a former <a>O'Keefe Brewery</a>, which was transformed to house the school. It has two buildings devoted to education programs and research activities.</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>The school features <a>cooperative education</a> in all of its undergraduate programs. The bachelor's programs have all been accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).  Each year, the ETS graduates the largest number of engineers in Quebec and third largest in Canada. Students can choose to specialize in the following disciplines: <a>Construction Engineering</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a>, <a>Information Technology Engineering</a>, <a>Software Engineering</a>, <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>, <a>Industrial Engineering</a> It also offers multiple master's degree programs and a doctorate in engineering. International students at the masters and doctorate levels are mostly coming from Latin America, Europe, North Africa and Eastern Europe. The main research fields are energy, environment, manufacturing and fabrication, health technologies, entreprises systems, IT, micro-electronics and telecommunications and finally, aerospace manufacturing and avionics.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The ETS student-run technical clubs participate in international competitions. The world's fastest human powered submarine, <a>Omer</a> [<a>http://omer.etsmtl.ca</a>], was developed by one such club. An <a>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</a> named S.O.N.I.A.[<a>http://sonia.etsmtl.ca</a>], a walking robot [<a>http://wm.etsmtl.ca/</a>], Eclipse [<a>http://eclipse.etsmtl.ca/</a>] the solar-powered car and many others have won countless prizes in international competitions over the years. The school also houses a concrete canoe club, the reigning Canadian champions three years running.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>The school is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the <a>ETS Piranhas</a>.</p>
<p>The school's <a>student union</a> (<a>student government</a>) is called the <em>Association des &#x00e9;tudiants de l'&#x00e9;cole de technologie sup&#x00e9;rieure</em> (<strong>AEETS</strong>) (The ETS <a>Student Association</a>).</p>
