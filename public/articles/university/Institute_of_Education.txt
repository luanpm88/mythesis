<p>The <strong>Institute of Education</strong> (<strong>IOE</strong>) is a constituent college of the <a>University of London</a>, dedicated to <a>postgraduate</a> study and research in the field of <a>education</a>. The Institute is the largest education research body in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, with over 700 research students in the doctoral school. It also has the largest portfolio of postgraduate programmes in education in the UK, with approximately 4,000 students taking <a>Master's</a> programmes, and a further 1,200 students doing <a>PGCE</a> teacher-training courses. </p>
<p>The Institute has long been recognised as a leading centre of educational enquiry. At any one time it hosts over 100 research projects funded by <a>Research Council</a>s, government departments and other agencies. The Institute publishes <em><a>Educate~</a></em> &#x2013; The Journal of Doctoral Research in Education</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1900, a report on the training of teachers, produced by the Higher Education Sub-Committee of the Technical Education Board (TEB) of the <a>London County Council</a>, called for further provision for the training of teachers in London in universities. The TEB submitted a scheme to the Senate of the <a>University of London</a> for a new day training college which would train teachers of both sexes when most existing courses were taught in in single sex colleges or departments. The principal of the proposed college was also to act as the Professor of the Theory, History and Practice of Education at the University. The new college was opened on the 6 October 1902 as the <strong>London Day Training College</strong> under the administration of the LCC </p>
<p>Its first Principal was <a>Sir John Adams</a>, who had previously been the Professor of Education at <a>University of Glasgow</a>. Adams was joined with a mistress and master of Method (later Vice-Principals). The bulk of the teaching was carried out by the Vice-Principals and other specialists were appointed to teach specific subjects, including <a>Cyril Burt</a>. Initially the LDTC only provided teacher training courses lasting between 1 and 3 years.</p>
<p>In 1909 the LDTC became a school of the University of London and was wholly transferred to the University and was renamed the <strong>University of London, Institute of Education</strong>. Gradually the Institute expanded its activities and began to train secondary school teachers and offered higher degrees. It also moved into specific areas of research with its Child Development Department, administered by [[Susan Isaacs|Susan Sutherland Isaacs]] and the training of teachers for the colonial service. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Institute was temporarly transferred to the [[University of Nottingham]].</pre>
<p>As a result of the report of the McNair Committee, which was established by the <a>Board of Education</a> to examine recruitment and training of teachers and youth leaders a new scheme for teacher training was established in England. &#x2018;Area Training Organisations&#x2019; (ATO) were created to coordinate the provision of teacher training  and were responsible for the overall administration of all colleges of education within their area. The ATO for the London area was based at the University London under the name '''University of London, Institute of Education''', which was responsible for around 30 existing colleges of education and education departments, including the existing Institute of Education.  The colleges (known as 'constituent colleges' of the Institute) prepared students for the 'Certificate in Education' of the Institute, and latterly for the [[Bachelor of Education]] and [[Bachelor of Humanities]] degrees of the University.  The existing Institute (referred to as the &#x2018;Central Institute&#x2019;) and the new ATO (referred to as the &#x2018;Wider Institute&#x2019;) had separate identities, but confusingly were administered from the same building and by the same administrate staff. This dual identity continued until the Wider Institute gradually disappeared and was finally dissolved in 1975, coinciding with the closure (or 'merger' with local polytechnics and other institutions) of many of the colleges of education.</pre>
<p>In 1987 the Institute once again became a school of the University of London and was incorporated by Royal Charter.</p>
<h2>Premises</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Front</a> <a>thumb|right|250px|Rear</a> The first home of the Institute of Education (as the London Day Training College) was Passmore Edwards Hall on <a>Clare Market</a>, which belonged to the <a>London School of Economics</a>. It moved again in its second year to the Northampton Technical Institute in <a>Finsbury</a> and the <a>College of Preceptors</a> building in <a>Bloomsbury Square</a>. In 1907 the College moved to its first purpose built building on <a>Southampton Row</a>. In 1938, the Institute moved to the <a>Senate House complex</a> of the <a>University of London</a> on <a>Malet Street</a>. After <a>World War II</a>, the Senate House complex became unworkable due to a sharp increase in numbers of students. The Institute began to expand into other buildings in the neighbouring area, including four houses on Bedford Way which were leased as a residential hall for students in 1946, a building on <a>Tavistock Square</a> as home of the music department in 1958, and a few 'huts' on Malet Street (formerly belonging to the University of London Student Union) where the library was transferred.  In 1960, plans were prepared for a new building on Bedford Way designed by <a>Denys Lasdun</a>, though only part of his initial design was completed. The library was one of the aspects dropped from the design and in 1968 it was moved from huts into a converted office block on Ridgemount Street. The Bedford building was completed in 1975 and was officially opened by <a>Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother</a>, Chancellor of the University of London in 1977. The library finally moved into an extension of the Bedford Way building in 1992 and was renamed the 'Newsam Library' after Peter Newsam, the Director who oversaw the new construction.</p>
<h2>Newsam Library</h2>
<p>The Institute's Newsam Library is the largest in its field in Europe, containing more than 300,000 volumes and nearly 2,000 periodicals.</pre>
<h3>Main Collections</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Educational collection of publications covering every aspect of education in the United Kingdom.</li>

<h3>Basic Skills Agency Resource Centre</h3>
<p>The Basic Skills Agency Resource Centre, which was established in 1993 by the Basic Skills Agency, contains teaching materials for adult education and is available for anyone interested in basic skills. In 2005 the Basic Skills Agency passed responsibility the funding for the collection onto the Institute and the collection now sits within the Newsam library's teaching resources collection.</pre>
<h3>Special Collections</h3>
<p>There are over 20 special collections of publications held by the Newsam Library. Some of the collections relate to a specific subject area or have been collection by a single source. The collection contains a comprehensive range of documents on education in the UK, the National Textbook Collection, and other unique resources.</pre>
<h3>Archives</h3>
<p>The Institute has been amassing archive collections since the 1940s, and now holds over 100 deposited collections as well as the records of the Institute itself. The deposited collections contain the personal of educationalist and other notable people involved with education and the records of educational organisations such as trade unions, and education projects. The Archives are open to both internal and external researchers by appointment only.</pre>
<h2>Centre for Longitudinal Studies</h2>
<p>The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) is an ESRC Resource Centre based at the IoE.  CLS houses three of Britain's internationally-renowned <a>birth cohort studies</a>:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p><a>National Child Development Study</a> (NCDS)</p>
<p><a>1970 British Cohort Study</a> (BCS70)</p>
<p><a>Millennium Cohort Study</a> (MCS): 2000 birth cohort</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The studies were key sources of evidence for a number of UK Government inquiries such as the <a>Plowden Committee</a> on Primary Education (1967), the Warnock Committee on Children with Special Educational Needs (1978), the <a>Finer</a> Committee on One Parent Families (1966&#x2013;74), the Acheson Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health (1998) and the Moser Committee on Adult Basic Skills (1997&#x2013;99).  A study of working mothers and early child development was influential in making the argument for increased maternity leave. Another study on the impact of assets, such as savings and investments on future life chances, played a major part in the development of assets-based welfare policy, including the much-debated <a>'Baby Bond'</a>.</p>
