<p>The  <strong>National Law School of India University</strong> (NLSIU or NLS) is an institution for under-graduate and graduate legal education. Based in Nagarbhavi, a suburb in the western extremities of the city of <a>Bangalore</a>, the NLSIU was established in <a>1987</a> after a <a>statute</a> was enacted for that purpose by the Legislative Assembly of the State of <a>Karnataka</a>, and officially exists since August 29, 1987.</p>
<h2>A Bold Experiment in Legal Education</h2>
<p>Historically, legal education in India was open only to graduates and seen merely as professional training. Dismayed at the quality of legal education in conventional universities, members of the legal fraternity debated the merits of introducing a new system of legal education through the 1970s and 1980s. NLSIU has been consistently ranked as the best law school in India for 8 out of the past 10 years by <a>India Today</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Bar Council of India</a> decided to make the NLSIU law programme a five-year course (in contrast with the American post-graduate system), with courses in the liberal arts included in the first two years. NLSIU has exchange programmes in place with <a>Georgetown University</a> in the United States, the <a>National University of Singapore</a>, Canada's <a>Osgoode Hall Law School</a> and Germany's <a>Hamburg University</a> and <a>University of Munich</a>. It admits 80 students for its 5-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) programme every year. Students are chosen on the basis of an all-India entrance exam (Common Law Admission Test).  Foreign nationals are encouraged to apply, with five seats being reserved for foreign nationals (preference is given to students from <a>SAARC</a> countries).</p>
<h2>Post Graduate Degree Course</h2>
<p>In its Post-Graduate Degree Course (LL.M.), NLSIU presently offers two specializations, one in Business Laws and the other in Human Rights. This course aims at producing scholars/experts in the pertinent field of law. Therefore, LL.M. students are designated as &quot;Research Scholars&quot;. The LL.M. at NLSIU is a specially designed Post-Graduate Course, different from all the other Post-Graduate Courses presently offered by any other Indian University. There are currently 25 seats for Human Rights and 25 for Business Laws. Two seats are reserved for Foreign Nationals. Students are selected through the CLAT (Common Law Admission Test) conducted by all the Law Schools in India. A prospectus can be obtained from NLSIU on payment of the requisite fee.</p>
<p>NLSIU also offers part-time distance learning programmes, including a<a>Masters Degree</a> in <a>Business Law</a> and <a>Postgraduate Diploma</a> programs in <a>Human Rights Law</a>, Medical Law, <a>Environmental Law</a> and <a>IP Law</a>.</p>
<h2>Early history</h2>
<p>NLSIU was started in 1987 under the stewardship of its Founder-Director, <a>Dr. N.R. Madhava Menon</a> and has since had four other directors, including the present Vice-Chancellor , Dr. R. Venkata Rao who took over the institution in April 2009.  The first batch of students joined the integrated five-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) course on July 1, 1988.  The first classes commenced even before the college buildings had been built, and thus the NLSIU started functioning from the premises of the Central College, Bangalore University and continued there until November 1991, when it finally moved to its present location in Nagarbhavi.</p>
<p>Previously, Dr. N.R. Madhava Menon, Dr. N.L. Mitra, Dr. A Jayagovind and Dr. G. Mohan Gopal have held the position of Director of the NLSIU.</p>
<h2>Legal research and student activities</h2>
<p>The student body enjoys a great degree of autonomy and coordinates a wide range of activities. The Student Bar Association (SBA) is the umbrella body that coordinates all student activities, and all students are members of the SBA. The SBA has created various Activity-Based Committees (ABCs) which are in charge of specific student activities. The high level of student autonomy also runs to the various hostels, which are run by various hostel committees.  Co- and extracurricular activities promoted at NLSIU include debating, quizzing, music, dance, theatre and other literary and cultural activities. Students from the National Law School publish an informal literary magazine called Quirk since January 2005.</p>
<p>NLSIU has played a role in actively promoting <a>Parliamentary Debate</a> in India, and regularly participates in many international competitions, including the <a>World Universities Debating Championship</a> <a>World Universities Debating Championship</a>, where it reached the ESL Finals in 2002 and in 2007. NLSIU is currently ranked as the highest Indian team in the World rankings. [<a>http://flynn.debating.net/colpoint.htm</a>] NLSIU also has the distinction of achieving the 12th best institutional performance in the last two years at the WUDC. It recently won the 15th All Asian Debating Championships held in Dhaka in 2008, with 3 out of the 4 semi-finalist teams, and 6 of the top 10 speakers, being from NLSIU. Another boost for the Parliamentary Debate movement in NLSIU came in the form of the <a>Cambridge University</a> Debate Competition 2009, where the NLSIU team became the first South Asian team to reach the second round of the competition. NLSIU has also performed extremely well in the inaugural Asians BP Tournament held in Chulalongkorn University, with all three of its teams reaching the semi finals of the tournament, and two out of the top ten speakers (and four in the top 20).</p>
<p>NLSIU has produced good teams for <a>Moot Court</a>s. It is the only University in South Asia to have won the prestigious <a>Jessup Cup</a>. Reaffirming its supremacy, NLSIU became the first team from India to emerge as the World Champion at the Manfred Lachs Moot 2009, defeating Georgetown University (United States) in the Final held at Daejeon, South Korea, adjudicated by their Excellencies Judges Koroma, Tomka and Skotnikov. Raeesa Vakil of the NLSIU was awarded the Sterns and Tennen Best Oralist Award, outdoing team mate Abhimanyu George Jain, who had won the Best Oralist award at the Asia-Pacific level. Furthermore, the NLSIU moot team has won India's most prestigious Moot Court Competition the <a>Bar Council of India</a> Moot in 2007, 2008 and 2009, thus keeping their formidable reputation intact.</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p>The NLS library is the largest law library in India. The library is the 'heart' of the academic institution and plays an important role in all academic activities. Keeping in view the aims and objectives of the Law School, the library has been planned and is being developed by a team of qualified professional library staff, guided by the Library Council. It has a collection of over 40,000 volumes covering a wide range of general and special subjects consisting of text books, reference books, back volumes of journals and reports etc., apart from current legal periodicals. The Library functions from 8.30 A.M. to midnight . The library has adopted an open access system so as to facilitate easy access to library resources.</p>
<p>The NLSIU Library has also established links with other important libraries in and around Bangalore in order to provide inter-library access for the benefit of students and teachers of the NLSIU. To assist the Students and Research Scholars in locating literature as well as information in their area of research, general reference, current awareness and computerized catalogues have been introduced. Further, essential reading materials will be supplied to the students in each subject at the beginning of the trimester by the University. An orientation program for new students is also organized to help them acquaint themselves with the library system and services for the maximum utilization of the available resources.</p>
<p>The NLSIU has introduced computerized facilities for both housekeeping as well as information retrieval. Since there is a line connection to the internet, it is possible to have easy access to information directly from all available computerized data bases all over the world, not only in the field of law but also in other disciplines. Keeping in mind the vision to create an E-Law School, the University subscribes to many international online databases like <a>Westlaw International</a>, <a>JSTOR</a>, <a>Kluwer Online</a>, Springer Link etc. which contains enormous resources like international case reporters, statutes, and articles from law reviews, an invaluable source for a law school student. Similarly, Indian online data bases like manupatra.com, indlaw.com are also available for students and faculty. NLSIU is among the first legal educational institutions in India to subscribe to these online databases. The library has CD-ROMs search facilities and the library has acquired important CD-ROM databases such as SCC-Online and Grand Jurix. With a computerized library system it is the aim of the library to establish a network of law libraries in India and also to establish a National Legal Information Centre, which will act as a clearing house of information in the field of law.</p>
<p>The modern, state-of-the-art library building is equipped with wi-fi internet connection as well as modern Audio-Visual equipment, teleconferencing facilities, etc. Special arrangements have been made for physically disabled persons to make use of the library. This is a multi (three) storeyed building with ample space of . built area for storage of books and reading purposes. The building has been designed by well- known architects, with the financial assistance of the <a>University Grants Commission (India)</a>and Mrs. Sudha Murthy.</p>

<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>As stated by a former director, one of the principal objectives in establishing the NLSIU was to increase the quality of the <a>bar</a>. However, it has been pointed out that most of those who graduate from NLSIU prefer a career in corporate litigation or as legal advisers to companies, instead of joining the bar. While this has been attributed to the increased presence of multinational corporations in India, along with the low salaries paid by advocates, no changes seem to have been made to combat this problem. This was intensified when <a>Clifford Chance</a> and the rest of the <a>Magic Circle</a>, <a>Silver Circle</a> law firms handed training contracts to twelve NLS students in 2006, which led to criticism by the Executive Council, including the Chief Justice, that not enough alumni were going into full-time litigation.In fact it was found that most of the students hardly litigate in courts as it's hard to sustain on income during initial years of regular law practice under Indian conditions. Moreover, the amount of fees being charged in the institution is too expensive, compared to the private law colleges of india, which makes it difficult for an ordinary indian student even to think about studying at NLSIU. Annual fee structure of NLSIU bangalore ranges somewhere between INR 1.5 to 1.7 lakhs, which is far expensive than even Engineering courses in india. In such a situation, after investing so much of money into education, it is quite natural that the students chose a better paying job, than pursueing litigation. .</p>
<p>Many reports published by news journals like India Today point out to existence of formidable cartels formed by the alumni of NLSIU which alumni of other recent Law Schools find tough to crack especially among the top law firms and in house legal departments of companies. Its criticised particularly on the point that other Law Schools formed on similar format as the NLSIU but much later in time have been losing out because of the cartelisation by NLSIU alumni of major law firms and Corporate jobs.</p>
<p>Another major criticism among the lawyers about NLSIU is that corporates hire the graduates of NLSIU, just going by their brandname, many times ordinary law graduate would be paid 10 times lesser than an NLSIU graduate, for the same job.</p>
