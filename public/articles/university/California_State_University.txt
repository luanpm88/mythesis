<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>California State University</strong> (<strong>CSU</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> <a>system</a> in the <a>state</a> of <a>California</a>. It is one of three public higher <a>education</a> systems in the state, the other two being the <a>University of California</a> system and the <a>California Community College</a> system. It is incorporated as <strong>The Trustees of the California State University</strong>. The California State University system headquarters are at 401 Golden Shore in <a>downtown Long Beach</a>.</p>
<p>The CSU system is composed of 23 campuses and has over 400,000 students supported by 47,000 faculty members and staff.</pre>
<p>It is the largest senior system of higher education in the <a>United States</a>.</pre>
<p>CSU prepares about 60 percent of the <a>teacher</a>s in the state, 40 percent of the <a>engineering</a> graduates, and more graduates in <a>business</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, <a>communications</a>, <a>health</a>, <a>education</a> and <a>public administration</a> than all other California <a>universities</a> and <a>colleges</a> combined. Altogether, about half the <a>bachelor's degree</a>s and a third of the <a>master's degree</a>s awarded annually in California are from the CSU.</p>
<p>Since 1961 nearly 2.5 million <a>alumni</a> have received a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree from the university system. CSU offers more than 1,800 degree programs in some 240 subject areas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Today's California State University system is the direct descendant of the <a>California State Normal School</a> (now <a>San Jose State University</a>), a <a>normal school</a> established by the California Legislature on May 2, 1862. The California State Normal School was itself derived from the City of San Francisco's <a>Minns Evening Normal School</a> (founded in 1857) a normal school legislature dropped the word &quot;California&quot; from the name of the San Jose and Los Angeles schools, renaming them &quot;State Normal Schools.&quot; Later Chico (1887), San Diego (1897), and other schools became part of the State Normal School system. In 1919, the State Normal School at Los Angeles became the Southern Branch of the University of California (now the <a>University of California, Los Angeles</a>). In 1921, the State Normal Schools became the State Teachers Colleges. By this time most of the campuses started to become identified by their city names plus the word &quot;state&quot; (e.g., &quot;San Jose State,&quot; &quot;San Diego State,&quot; &quot;San Francisco State&quot;).</p>
<p>In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges became the California State Colleges and were administered by the California State Department of Education in Sacramento. The <a>Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960</a> gave the system greater autonomy from the State of California.</p>
<p>The postwar period brought a great expansion in the number of colleges in the system.  Campuses in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Long Beach were added between 1947 and 1949.  Then seven more were authorized to be built between 1957 and 1960.  Six more campuses joined the system after the establishment of the Donohoe Higher Education Act in 1960 bringing the total number to 23.</p>
<p>In 1972 the system became The California State University and Colleges, and all of the campuses were renamed with the words &quot;California State University&quot; in their names.  Former San Diego State University student body president Calvin Robinson wrote the bill, signed into law by Ronald Reagan, that allowed every California State University the option to revert the schools back to their pre-1972 names: San Jose State, San Diego State, San Francisco State, etc.  In 1982, the CSU system dropped the word &quot;colleges&quot; from its name.</p>
<p>Today the campuses of the CSU include comprehensive and <a>polytechnic</a> universities and the only <a>Maritime Academy</a> in the western United States that receives aid from the federal <a>Maritime Administration</a>.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Office of the Chancellor in Long Beach</a> The governance structure of the California State University is largely determined by state law. The California State University is ultimately administered by the 25 member <a>Board of Trustees of the California State University</a>. The Trustees appoint the <a>Chancellor of the California State University</a>, who is the <a>chief executive officer</a> of the system, and the Presidents of each campus, who are the chief executive officers of their respective campuses.</p>
<p>The <a>Academic Senate of the California State University</a>, made up of elected representatives of the faculty from each campus, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.</p>
<h3>Board of Trustees</h3>
<p>The California State University is administered by the 25 member Board of Trustees (BOT). The BOT is composed of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>16 members that are appointed by the <a>Governor of California</a> with the consent of the Senate</li>
  <li>two students from the California State University appointed by the Governor</li>
  <li>a tenured faculty member appointed by the Governor selected from a list of names from the Academic Senate</li>
  <li>a representative of the alumni associations of the state university selected for a two-year term by the alumni council of the California State University</li>
  <li>5 <a>ex officio</a> members:
    <ul>
      <li>Governor</li>
      <li>Lieutenant Governor</li>
      <li>Speaker of the Assembly</li>
      <li>State Superintendent of Public Instruction</li>

<h3>Chancellor</h3>
<p>The position of the Chancellor is declared by statute, and is defined by resolutions of the BOT. The delegation of authority from the BOT to the Chancellor has historically been controlled by a BOT resolution titled &quot;Statement of General Principles in the Delegation of Authority and Responsibility&quot; of August 4, 1961, and is now controlled by the Standing Orders of the Board of Trustees of the California State University. The Chancellor is the chief executive officer, and all Presidents report directly to the Chancellor.</p>

<h2>Endowment</h2>
<p>The California State University's permanent, collective endowment has grown to $874 million U.S. dollars as of the close of the 2006-2007 academic year. In addition, each of the 23 campuses of the CSU raise their own funds through donations and other external funding, and each campus controls its own separate endowment funds not counted in the above endowment amount.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Faculty</h2>
<p>During the fall 2004 semester the system employed 11,069 full-time faculty members. The vast majority, 68.3% were tenured or tenure tracked with 59.2% having tenure. <a>Professors</a> comprised 86.6% of faculty members with a plurality, 43.6% being full professors. Associate professors consitituted 18.6% and Assistant professors 24.4% of faculty members while 13.4% were instructors and lecturers. The percentage of full professors declined 31.4% since fall of 1999, while that of assistant professors has risen 57.4%.</p>
<p>The CSU system requires faculty to sign a loyalty oath dating from the <a>Cold War</a>. Some campuses (most recently CSU Fullerton) have refused to hire academics who have refused to sign one, although others have provided for accommodations such as signing statements. <a>Quaker</a>s have been particular victims of this policy. </p>
<h3>Salary</h3>
<p>The average faculty salary was roughly $74,000 as of Spring 2007. As of April 2007, the faculty union and CSU have reached an agreement increasing faculty base salaries by 20.7%, boosting the average faculty salary from $74,000 to $91,000 by 2011. Salaries for full-professors will increase from $86,000 to $105,000. As of Fall 2004 average salaries were as follows:</p>

<h2>Differences between the CSU and UC systems</h2>
<p>Both <a>university</a> systems are <a>California</a> publicly funded higher education institutions.  Despite having fewer students, some individual UC campuses, as a result of their research emphasis and medical centers, have larger budgets than the entire CSU system. CSU's Chancellor, Dr Charles B Reed, pointed out when delivering his Pullias Lecture at USC, that California was big enough to afford two world-class systems of public higher education, one that supports research (UC) and one that supports teaching (CSU). However, student per capita spending is stretched far thinner at the CSU, and the lack of a <a>research</a> mission or independent  <a>doctoral programs</a> under the <a>California Master Plan</a> leads to a perceived lack of prestige among some academics. For many of the CSU system's early formative years, the more powerful UC system was able to delay or prevent the CSU campuses from gaining the right to grant bachelor's degrees, then later master's degrees and now doctorates in most fields. Thus while similar campuses in other states (e.g., Arizona State University) eventually grew from normal schools into research-oriented state universities, the UC system's powerful research university monopoly has successfully prevented the CSU from experiencing a similar development. Librarian Emeritus <a>Kevin Starr</a> has described the CSU as &quot;in so many ways the <a>Rodney Dangerfield</a> of public higher education.&quot;</p>
<pre>     </pre>
<p>According to the <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> (1960), both university systems may confer <a>Bachelors</a> or <a>Master's</a> degrees as well as professional certifications, however only the University of California has the authority to issue <a>Ph.D degrees (Doctor of Philosophy)</a> and professional degrees in the fields of <a>law</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>veterinary</a>, and <a>dentistry</a>. As a result of recent legislation (SB 724 and AB 2382), the California State University may now offer the <a>Ed.D</a> (also known as the <a>Doctor of Education</a> or &quot;education doctorate degree&quot;) and <a>DPT</a> (Doctor of Physical Therapy) degrees to its graduate students. Additionally, the California State University (CSU) offers Ph.D degrees and some professional doctorates (for instance, audiology, Au.D) as a &quot;joint degree&quot; in combination with other institutions of higher education, including &quot;joint degrees&quot; with the <a>University of California (UC)</a> and accredited private universities. This is why, for instance, San Diego State can qualify as a &quot;Research University with high research activity&quot;  by offering 16 doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>There are 23 CSU campuses and 9 UC campuses representing 414,000 and 191,000 students respectively.  The cost of CSU tuition is approximately half that of UC. Thus, the CSU system has been referred to by former California State University authorities as &quot;The People's University.&quot;</p>
<p>CSU and UC use the terms &quot;president&quot; and &quot;chancellor&quot; internally in exactly opposite ways:  At CSU, the campuses are headed by &quot;presidents&quot; who report to a systemwide &quot;chancellor&quot;; but at UC, they are headed by &quot;chancellors&quot; who report to a systemwide &quot;president&quot;.</p>
<p>CSU has traditionally been more accommodating to the older student than UC, by offering more degree programs in the evenings and, more recently, online. In addition, CSU schools, especially in more urban areas, have traditionally catered to the commuter, enrolling most of its students from the surrounding area. This has changed as CSU schools increase enrollment and some of the more prestigious urban campuses attract a wider demographic.</p>
<h3>Admission standards</h3>
<p>Historically the requirements for admission to the CSU have been less stringent than the UC system. The CSU attempts to accept applicants from the top one-third (1/3) of California high school graduates. In contrast, the UC attempts to accept the top one-eighth (1/8). In an effort to maintain a 60/40 ratio of upper division students to lower division students and to encourage students to attend a California <a>community college</a> first, both university systems give priority to <a>California community college</a> transfer students.</p>
<p>However, as of 2008 the following CSU campuses use <em>higher standards</em> than the basic admission standards because of the number of qualified students who apply to those campuses as first-time freshmen during the initial application filing period which therefore accounts as a <em>more competitive admissions school</em>:</pre>
<ul>
  <li>California Polytechnic State University</li>
  <li>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona</li>
  <li>California State University, Chico</li>
  <li>California State University, Fresno</li>
  <li>California State University, Fullerton</li>
  <li>California State University, Long Beach</li>
  <li>California State University, Northridge</li>
  <li>San Diego State University</li>
  <li>San Francisco State University</li>
  <li>San Jose State University</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profile of Enrolling Freshmen by Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<h4>Impacted Campuses</h4>
<p>An <em>impacted</em> campus or major is one which has more CSU-qualified students than capacity permits. As of 2006, CSU Long Beach, San Diego State, and Cal Poly SLO are impacted for both new freshmen and for transfer students, while CSU Fullerton, Cal Poly Pomona, CSU San Bernardino, and Sonoma State are impacted for new freshmen. Some programs at other campuses are similarly impacted. Despite this, CSU undergraduate admissions are quantitatively based and generally do not include items such as personal statements, SAT Subject Test scores, letters of recommendation, or portfolios. In addition, there is geographic preference given to those residing within the commuting areas of the colleges.</pre>
<h4>Special admissions process for the California Maritime Academy</h4>
<p>The <a>Maritime Academy</a> uses a different admissions process from other CSU schools. Because of the nature of its programs, the Maritime Academy requires all applicants to pass a standard physical examination prior to enrollment. <em>Italic text</em></p>
