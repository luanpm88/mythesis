Beginning in the 1950s, the school was relocated to its current location in the borough of <a>Queens</a>. St. John's also has campuses in <a>Staten Island</a>, <a>Manhattan</a>, and <a>Rome, Italy</a>, as well as a graduate center in <a>Oakdale, New York</a>.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>St. John's University was founded in 1870, by the <a>Vincentian Fathers</a> of the <a>Roman Catholic Church</a> in response to an invitation by the first <a>Bishop</a> of Brooklyn, <a>John Loughlin</a>, to provide the poor youth of the city with an intellectual and moral education.</p>
<p>St. John's Vincentian values stem from the ideals and works of <a>St Vincent de Paul</a> (1581&#x2013;1660), who is the patron saint of Christian charity. Following the Vincentian tradition, the university seeks to provide an education that encourages greater involvement in social justice, charity and service.</p>
<p>St. John's University was originally founded as St. John's College at 75 Lewis Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Beginning with the law school in 1925, St. John's started founding other schools and became a university in 1933. In 1954, St. John's broke ground on a new campus in Jamaica, Queens, on the former site of the Hillcrest Golf Club. The following year, the original school of the university, St. John's College, moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant to the new campus. Over approximately the next two decades, the other schools of the university, which were located at a separate campus at 96 Schermerhorn Street in <a>Downtown Brooklyn</a>, moved out to the new campus in Queens. The last of the schools to relocate to Queens would move there in 1972, bringing an end to the Downtown Brooklyn campus of the university.</p>
<p>The <a>St. John's University strike of 1966-1967</a> was a protest by faculty at the university which began on January 4, 1966, and ended in June 1967. [<a>http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/psc.html</a>] The strike began after 31 faculty members were dismissed in the fall of 1965 without due process, dismissals which some felt were a violation of the professors' academic freedom. The tension of that year was noted in <a>Time Magazine</a> stating, &quot;[A]cademically, [St. John's University] has never ranked high among Catholic schools; in troubles, it outdoes them all.&quot;[<a>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842336,00.html</a>] The strike ended without any reinstatements, but led to the widespread unionization of public college faculty in the New York City area. In 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1971, the <a>New York State Board of Regents</a> approved the consolidation of the University with the former <a>Notre Dame College (New York)</a> a private <a>women's college</a> and the Staten Island Campus of St. John&#x2019;s University became a reality.  Classes began in the fall of 1971, combining the original Notre Dame College with the former Brooklyn campus of St. John&#x2019;s, offering undergraduate degrees in liberal arts, business and education.</p>

<p>In 1999, St. John's purchased the La Salle Center in Oakdale, NY. The  campus served as a military academy since 1926. Before this, the land was owned by Frederick Bourne, President of <a>Singer Sewing Machine Company</a>, who constructed his estate on the grounds. His mansion still remains and is used for party receptions.</p>
<p>St. John's merged with the <a>College of Insurance</a> in 2001. The merger gave St. John's a five-story building located in lower Manhattan which is used by the Peter J. Tobin College of Business and the colleges School of Risk Management, Insurance and Actuarial Science. After the 9/11 attacks to the World Trade Center, the Manhattan campus was used by emergency workers.</p>
<p>In 2007, St. John's, along with several other universities, settled with New York State attorney general <a>Andrew Cuomo</a> for $800,000.00 among allegations of receiving kickbacks from student loan corporations.</p>
<p>Also in 2007, St John's University purchased a <a>Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Center</a> facility in <a>Fresh Meadows</a>. This added two medical programs to the school.  This added a Physician's Assistant program as well as Bio-medical technician program to the school. Tuition for the PA program at Saint Vincent Medical Center was $15,000 per year [<a>http://www.svcmc.org/body.cfm?id=1185</a>], but when purchased by STJ it increased to 29,950 per year. [<a>http://www.stjohns.edu/services/financial/bursar/tuition.stj</a>]/ </p>
<p>St. John's opened its new Rome campus in October 2008. Located in the <a>Prati section</a> of Rome, the . building can house up to 200 students. The university is organized into six colleges and schools: St. John's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, Peter J. Tobin College of Business, the College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, the College of Professional Studies, and the <a>School of Law</a>.</p>

<p><a>thumb|Manhattan vertical campus</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Manhattan</a> - St. John&#x2019;s officially opened its Manhattan Campus in June 2001, after its merger with <a>The College of Insurance</a> (TCI). Through the merger, TCI became the School of Risk Management and operates as a unit of the Peter J. Tobin College of Business. This ten-story, prize-winning &quot;vertical campus&quot; features a five-story entrance atrium, 16 conference and seminar rooms, dormitories, 24 high-tech classrooms, and a variety of computer labs. The new campus is located within the Vincentian Motherhouse in Paris. The building will be named &quot;The D'Angelo Center&quot; after Board of Trustees member Peter D'Angelo '78 MBA, and his wife Peg D'Angelo '70 Ed.</p>
<p>In 2005, St. John's constructed Taffner Field house, and dramatically renovated Carnesecca Hall and the University Center. Renovations to Carnesecca Hall included a . Health Center, for use by Student Life and athletics, including weight training equipment, aerobic and dance studios, and a student lounge. The University Center renovations consisted of reconfigured office and meeting space for Student Life and academic clubs, and the addition of audio/visual rooms for all varsity athletic teams. Taffner Athletic Field House was $23 million initiative. The two-story, . structure adjacent to Carnesecca Hall includes four basketball courts, academic classrooms,</p>
<p>The 2004-2005 academic years saw $35 million in capital projects, including the completion of St. Thomas More church, the DaSilva academic building, Carnesecca Hall Fitness Center, and Belson Stadium. In 2005 the science labs and student life facilities were the target of an additional $60 million in capital enhancements.</p>
<p>In regards to its expansion plans, the university has had an contenscious relationship with the surrounding community in the past. In 2007, however, it was discovered that the university was planning to lease a building under construction by a separate company for an off-campus dormitory. Nevertheless, opponents, including state Senator <a>Frank Padavan</a>, argue that such an explanation is &quot;disingenuous&quot;.</p>
<p>The university has seen much growth on its campuses in order to attract students from outside the New York area. In 1999, the first dormitory was completed on the Queens campus. As of 2008, the campus now contains seven dorms and a townhouse complex. Until 1994, the St. John's mascot was the Redmen, which referenced the red uniforms worn by the university in competition. However, the name was interpreted as a Native American reference in the 1960s, and was changed to the Red Storm after mounting pressure on colleges and universities to adopt names more sensitive to Native American culture. The Redmen name still remains popular among fans, however, as does the pejorative &quot;Johnnies&quot;.  </p>
<p>St. John's basketball according to a Sports Illustrated article was once mighty and has now fallen. [<a>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/the_bonus/11/19/stjohns/</a>] .  It was argued that this is because St. John's could no longer offer the housing stipend to its basketball players that it was allowed when it built dorms. [<a>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/the_bonus/11/19/stjohns/</a>]  .  It was argued in this article that one player <a>Sylven Landesberg</a> chose <a>University of Virginia</a> because it was a superior academic school.
