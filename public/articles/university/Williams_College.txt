<p> <strong>Williams College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Williamstown</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>, <a>United States</a>. Established in 1793 with funds from the estate of <a>Ephraim Williams</a>, Williams is one of the oldest academic institutions in the United States. Originally a <a>men's college</a>, Williams became co-educational in 1970. <a>Fraternities</a> were also phased out during this period, beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Williams forms part of the historic <a>Little Three</a> colleges, along with <a>Wesleyan University</a> and rival <a>Amherst College</a>.</p>
<p>There are three academic curricular divisions (<a>humanities</a>, <a>sciences</a> and <a>social sciences</a>), 24 departments, 33 <a>majors</a>, and two <a>master's degree</a> programs in <a>art history</a> and <a>development economics</a>. There are 315 voting faculty members, with a <a>student-to-faculty ratio</a> of 7:1. As of 2009, the school has an enrollment of 2,124 undergraduate students and 49 graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>academic year</a> follows a 4-1-4 schedule of two four-course <a>semester</a>s plus a one-course &quot;winter study&quot; term in January.  A summer research schedule involves about 200 students on campus completing projects with professors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|Haystack monument</a> Colonel <a>Ephraim Williams</a> was an officer in the Massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family. His <a>will</a> included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of West Hoosac, Massachusetts, provided that the town change its name to Williamstown. Williams was killed at the <a>Battle of Lake George</a> on September 8, 1755.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>After <a>Shays' Rebellion</a>, the Williamstown Free School opened with 15 students on October 26, 1791. The first president was <a>Ebenezer Fitch</a>. Not long after its founding, the trustees of the school petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college. The legislature agreed and on June 22, 1793, Williams College was <a>charter</a>ed.  It was the second college to be founded in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In 1806, a student prayer meeting gave rise to the American Foreign Mission Movement.  In August of that year, five students met in the maple grove of Sloan's Meadow to pray. A thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack, and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the <a>Gospel</a> abroad. The students went on to build the <a>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions</a>, the first American organization to send <a>missionaries</a> overseas.  The Haystack Monument near Mission Park on the Williams Campus commemorates the historic &quot;<a>Haystack Prayer Meeting</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>By 1815, Williams had only two buildings and 58 students and was in financial trouble, so the board voted to move the college to <a>Amherst, Massachusetts</a>.  In 1821, the president of the college, <a>Zephaniah Swift Moore</a>, who had accepted his position believing that the college would move east, decided to proceed with the move.  He took 15 students with him, and refounded the college under the name of <a>Amherst College</a>.  Some students and professors decided to stay behind at Williams and were allowed to keep the land, which was at the time relatively worthless.  According to legend, Moore also took portions of the Williams College library. Though plausible, the transfer of books is unsubstantiated. Moore died just two years later after founding Amherst, and was succeeded by <a>Heman Humphrey</a>, a trustee of Williams College.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Dorr Griffin]] was appointed President of Williams and is widely credited with saving Williams during his 15-year tenure.</pre>
<p>A Williams student, Gardner Cotrell Leonard, designed the gowns he and his classmates wore to graduation in 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academic Garb&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later he advised the Inter-Collegiate Commission on Academic Costume, which met at [[Columbia University]], and established the current system of U.S. [[academic dress]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Helen. &quot;The Story of Caps and Gowns,&quot; p. 9. Chicago: E. R. Moore, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason gowns were adopted in the late nineteenth century was to eliminate the differences in apparel between rich and poor students.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Gardner Cotrell. &quot;The Cap and Gown in America; Reprinted from the University Magazine of 1893; To Which is Added: An Illustrated Sketch of the Intercollegiate System of Academic Costume,&quot; p. 9. Albany, New York: Cotrell &amp; Leonard, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; </pre>
<p>In the last decade, construction has changed the look of the college. The addition of the $38 million Unified Science Center to the campus in 2001 set a tone of style and comprehensiveness for renovations and additions to campus buildings in the 21st century. This building unifies the formerly separate lab spaces of the <a>physics</a>, <a>chemistry</a>, and <a>biology</a> departments. In addition, it houses Schow Science Library, notable for its unified science materials holdings and architecture. It features vaulted ceilings and an <a>atrium</a> with windows into laboratories on the second through fourth floors of the science center.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Thompson Chapel, Lasell Bell Tower</a> In 2003, Williams began the first of three massive construction projects. The $60 million '62 Center for Theatre and Dance was the first project to be successfully completed in the spring of 2005. The $44 million student center, called <a>Paresky Center</a>, opened in February 2007.</p>
<p>Construction has already begun on the third project, called the Stetson-Sawyer project, but economic uncertainty has led to its delay. College trustees initially balked at the cost of the Stetson-Sawyer project and revisited the idea of renovating Sawyer in its current location, an idea which proved not to be cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The entire project calls for two new academic buildings, the removal of the Sawyer Library from its current location, and the construction of a new library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall. The academic buildings, temporarily named North Academic Building and South Academic building, were completed in fall 2008. In the spring of 2009, South Academic Building was re-named Schapiro Hall in honor of former President [[Morton O. Schapiro]].  In the spring of 2010 the North Academic Building was re-named Hollander Hall. </pre>
<p>After several years of planning, the college decided to group undergraduates starting with the Class of 2010 into four geographically coherent clusters, or &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fall of 2006, first-years have been housed in Sage Hall, Williams Hall and Mission Park, while the former first-year [[dormitories]] East College, Lehman Hall, Fayerweather, and Morgan, joined the remaining residential buildings as upperclass housing. A student vote on the names of the four &quot;neighborhoods&quot; selected &quot;Currier&quot;, &quot;Wood&quot;, &quot;Spencer&quot; and &quot;Dodd&quot; by a simple majority. Incoming first-years, who live in groups of approximately 20, together with two junior advisors, are assigned to clusters based on their entries. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors have the opportunity to change neighborhoods each spring if they so choose. The system is an attempt to integrate all undergraduates more successfully than was previously possible, mixing students representing a variety of interests and ethnicities, as well as to foster student-faculty interaction and to de-centralize event planning. During the spring 2009 semester, a committee formed to evaluate the neighborhood system, and released a report the following fall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </pre>
<p>Williams recently ended one of the largest capital campaigns ever undertaken by a liberal arts college, with a goal of raising $400 million by September 2008.  The college reached $400 million at the end of June 2007, a year and a half ahead of schedule. At the close of the campaign, $500.2 million had been raised.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>As of the 2008-09 school year, the College eliminated <a>student loan</a>s from all <a>financial aid</a> packages in favor of grants.  The College is the fourth institution in the United States to do so, following <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>Amherst College</a>, and <a>Davidson College</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>However, in February 2010, the College announced that it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning with the Class of 2014 due to the College's changed financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Most-Colleges-Plan-to-Stick/22392/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In January 2007 the board voted unanimously to reduce college <a>CO2 emissions</a> 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, or roughly 50% below 2006 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams Sustainability Initiative&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  To meet those goals, the college has set up the Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives and undertaken an [[energy audit]] and efficiency timeline. Williams received an 'A-' on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card, following 'B+' grades on both the 2008 and 2009 report cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;College Sustainability Report Card&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>In December 2008, President Morton O. Schapiro announced his departure from the college to become president of <a>Northwestern University</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres. Shapiro to Lead Northwestern&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>On September 28, 2009, the presidential search committee announced the appointment of <a>Adam F. Falk</a> as the 17th president of Williams College. Falk, dean of the <a>Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences</a> at <a>Johns Hopkins University</a>, began his term on April 1, 2010. &lt;ref name&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of the Faculty William Wagner took the position of interim president beginning in June 2009, and continued in that capacity until President-elect Falk took office.</pre>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Williams is a small, four-year, highly selective liberal arts college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The four-year, full-time, undergraduate program is classified as &quot;more selective, lower transfer-in&quot; and has an arts and sciences focus.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=168342&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq=</a>{%22ipug2005_ids%22%3A%224%22%2C%22ipgrad2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22enrprofile2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ugprfile2005_ids%22%3A%2212%22%2C%22sizeset2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22basic2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22eng2005_ids%22%3A%22%22%2C%22search_string%22%3A%22%22%2C%22first_letter%22%3A%22%22%2C%22level%22%3A%22%22%2C%22control%22%3A%22%22%2C%22accred%22%3A%22%22%2C%22state%22%3A%22%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22%22%2C%22urbanicity%22%3A%22%22%2C%22womens%22%3A%22%22%2C%22hbcu%22%3A%22%22%2C%22hsi%22%3A%22%22%2C%22tribal%22%3A%22%22%2C%22msi%22%3A%22%22%2C%22landgrant%22%3A%22%22%2C%22coplac%22%3A%22%22%2C%22urban%22%3A%22%22}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams is <a>accredited</a> by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There are three academic curricular divisions (<a>humanities</a>, <a>sciences</a>, and <a>social sciences</a>), 24 departments, 33 <a>majors</a>, and two small <a>master's degree</a> programs in <a>art history</a> and <a>development economics</a>. The <a>academic year</a> follows a 4-1-4 schedule of two four-course <a>semester</a>s plus a one-course &quot;winter study&quot; term in January. During the winter study term, students study various courses outside of typical curriculum for 3 weeks. Past course offerings have included: Ski patrol, Learn to Play Chess, Accounting, Inside Jury Deliberations, and Creating a Life: Shaping Your Life After Williams, among many others. Williams students often take the winter study term to study abroad or work on intensive research projects. </p>
<p>Williams granted 510 <a>bachelor's degrees</a> and 35 master's degrees in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot; /&gt; The cost of <a>tuition</a> and fees for 2009-2010 was $37,640; 50% of students were given <a>need-based financial aid</a>, which averaged $37,857.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Williams sponsors the <a>Williams-Mystic</a> program at <a>Mystic Seaport</a>; the Williams-Exeter Programme at <a>Exeter College</a> of <a>Oxford University</a>;&lt;ref name=&quot;WEprogram&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Williams in Africa. </p>
<h3>Selectivity</h3>
<p>In 2008, Williams's acceptance rate of 17.0% was the fifth lowest among the top liberal arts colleges ranked by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a>.</em>  Ranking above Williams in selectivity are (in order of lowest acceptance rate) <a>Amherst College</a> (14.8%), <a>Pomona College</a> (15.6%), <a>Swarthmore College</a> (15.9%), and <a>Middlebury College</a> (16.8%).  In 2009, Williams's acceptance rate rose to 20.6%. &lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>Williams ranks first in <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a><strong>s 2011 list of Best Liberal Arts Colleges in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;/&gt;  Williams has been first nine times since 1989, and has been first eleven times since US News started the rankings. August 11th, 2010, Williams was named #1 on Forbes' &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot; list, ahead of Princeton, and rival <a>Amherst College</a>. Williams was ranked # 7 in the 2010 </strong></em><a>Washington Monthly</a><em> rankings,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which focus on key academic outputs such as research, scientific grants won in the natural and social sciences and the number of B.A. graduates earning <a>Ph.Ds</a>. The survey also measures public service contributions. Williams ranked fifth, after <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, and <a>Stanford</a>, in a 2004 </em><a>Wall Street Journal</a><em> survey of the &quot;<a>feeder schools</a>&quot; to the top 15 business, law, and medical schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.wsjclassroom.com/pdfs/wsj_college_092503.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams ranks first in <a>Forbes</a>' 2010 ranking of America's Best Private Colleges, followed by Princeton and Amherst College.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams is ranked first by the National Collegiate Scouting Association, which ranks colleges based on student-athlete graduation rates, academic strength, and athletic prowess. Rounding out the top five are <a>Amherst College</a>, <a>Middlebury College</a>, <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>, and <a>Stanford University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.prnewsnow.com/Public_Release/K-12/226395.html</a>]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</em></p>
<h3>Oxbridge-style tutorials</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Chapin Hall</a> One of the distinctive features of a Williams education is modeled after the <a>tutorial system</a>s at <a>Oxford</a> and the <a>Cambridge</a>, which are rare in American higher education. Although tutorials at Williams were originally aimed at upperclassmen, the faculty voted in 2001 to expand the tutorial program.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Williams Curricular Innovation Faculty Vote May 16 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a diverse offering of tutorials, spanning many disciplines, including math and the sciences, that cater to students of all class years. In 2009-2010 alone, 62 tutorials are offered in 21 departments.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment for tutorials is capped at 10 students, who are then divided into five pairs that meet separately with the professor once a week. Each week, one of the students writes and presents a 5-7 page paper while the other student critiques it. The same pair reverses roles for the next week. The professor takes a more limited role than in a traditional lecture class, and usually allows students to steer and guide the direction of the conversation.</p>
<p>Student course evaluations for tutorials are typically very high. In a survey of alumni who had taken tutorials, more than 80% found their tutorials to be &quot;the most valuable of my courses&quot; at Williams.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>The <a>Board of Trustees</a> of Williams College has 25 members and is the governing authority of the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Employee Handbook&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the College serves on the Board <em><a>ex officio</a>.</em> There are five Alumni Trustees, each of whom serves for a five year term. There are five Term Trustees, each elected by the Board for five year terms. The remaining 14 members are Regular Trustees, also elected by the Board but serving up 15 years, although not beyond their seventieth birthday. </p>
<p>The Board appoints as senior executive officer of the college a President who is also a member of and the presiding officer of the faculty. Nine senior administrators report to the President including the <a>Dean of the Faculty</a>, <a>Provost</a>, and Dean of the College. Adam F. Falk was recently elected the 17th president of Williams, and took office on April 1, 2010.</p>
<p>College Council (CC) is the student government of Williams College.  Its members are elected to represent each neighborhood, each class, the first-year dorms, and the student body at large. CC allocates funds from the <a>Student Activities Fee</a>, appoints students to the faculty-student committees that oversee most aspects of college life, and debates issues of concern to the entire campus community. College Council is the forum through which students address concerns and make changes around campus.  CC is led by two co-Presidents.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Old Hopkins Observatory</a> Williams is situated on a  campus in <a>Williamstown, Massachusetts</a>, located in the <a>Berkshires</a> in rural northwestern Massachusetts. The campus contains more than 100 academic, athletic, and residential buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>Williams College is the site of the <a>Hopkins Observatory</a>, the oldest extant astronomical observatory in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasachoff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Erected in 1836&ndash;1838, it now contains the Mehlin Museum of Astronomy, including [[Alvan Clark]]'s first telescope (from 1852),&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasachoff&quot; /&gt; as well as the Milham Planetarium, which uses a [[zeiss projector|Zeiss Skymaster]] ZKP3/B optomechanical projector and an Ansible [[digital projector]], both installed in 2005.  The Hopkins Observatory's 0.6-m DFM [[reflecting telescope]] (1991) is installed elsewhere on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams joins with [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], [[Wesleyan College|Wesleyan]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Colgate University|Colgate]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], and [[Haverford College|Haverford]]/[[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] to form the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, sponsored for over a decade by the [[Keck Foundation]] and now with its student research programs sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Hopkins Hall serves as the administration building on campus, housing the offices of the president, <a>Dean of the Faculty</a>, <a>registrar</a>, and <a>provost</a>, among others.</p>
<p>There is a <a>Newman Center</a> on campus; the Reverend Father <a>Gary C. Caster</a>, from the <a>Diocese of Peoria</a>, <a>Illinois</a>, is chaplain.  </p>
<p><a>thumb|Chapin Library</a>The Chapin Library supports the liberal arts curriculum of the college by allowing students close access to a number of rare books and documents of interest. The library opened on June 18, 1923, with an initial collection of 9,000 volumes contributed by alumnus <a>Alfred Clark Chapin</a>, Class of 1869. Over the years, Chapin Library has grown to include over 50,000 volumes (including 3,000 more given by Chapin) as well as 100,000 other artifacts such as <a>prints</a>, <a>photographs</a>, <a>maps</a>, and <a>bookplates</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The most famous items in the library's collection include first printings of the <a>Declaration of Independence</a>, <a>Articles of Confederation</a>, <a>United States Constitution</a>, and <a>Bill of Rights</a>, as well as <a>George Washington</a>'s personal copy of the <em><a>Federalist Papers</a></em>. Other notable objects include a range of books, letters, and miscellaneous items relating to <a>Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who was a friend and, at one point, colleague of Chapin in the <a>New York State Assembly</a>.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chapin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The Chapin Library's science collection includes a first edition of <a>Nicolaus Copernicus</a>'s <em><a>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></em>, as well as first editions of books by <a>Tycho Brahe</a>, <a>Johannes Kepler</a>, <a>Galileo</a>, <a>Isaac Newton</a>, and other major figures.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chapin&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb| Charles Moore's Ironic Columns, Williams College Museum of Art</a> The <a>Williams College Museum of Art</a> (WCMA), with over 12,000 works (only a fraction of which are displayed at any one time) in its permanent collection, serves as an educational resource for both undergraduates and students in the graduate art history program.&lt;ref name = &quot;WCMA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Notable works include <em>Morning in a City</em> by <a>Edward Hopper</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a commissioned wall painting by [[Sol LeWitt]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a commissioned outdoor sculpture and landscape work by [[Louise Bourgeois]] entitled ''Eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Though often overshadowed by the neighboring and much larger <a>Clark Art Institute</a> and <a>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art</a>, WCMA remains one of the premier attractions of the Berkshires. Because the museum is intended primarily for educational purposes, admission is free for all.&lt;ref name = &quot;WCMA&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Located in front of the West College dormitory, the Hopkins gate serves as a memorial to brothers <a>Mark</a> and Albert Hopkins.  Both made lasting contributions to the Williams College community.  Mark was appointed as president of the college in 1836, &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Albert was elected a professor in 1829. </pre>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The Hopkins gate is inscribed with an inspirational motto that is familiar to all in the Williams College community.   </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Climb High, Climb Far  &lt;br&gt; Your Goal the Sky, Your Aim the Star.  &lt;br&gt;</p>

<h2>Student activities and traditions</h2>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p>The longest running independent newspaper at Williams is the <em><a>Williams Record</a></em>, a weekly <a>broadsheet</a> paper published on Wednesdays. The newspaper was founded in 1885, and now has a weekly <a>circulation</a> of 3,000 copies distributed in Williamstown, in addition to more than 600 subscribers across the country. The newspaper does not receive financial support from the college or from the student government and relies on revenue generated by local and national ad sales, subscriptions, and voluntary contributions for use of its website. Both Sawyer Library and the College Archives maintain more than a century's worth of publicly accessible, bound volumes of the <em>Record</em>. The newspaper provides access free of charge to a searchable database of articles stretching back to 1998 on its website.</p>
<p>The student yearbook is called <em>The Gulielmensian</em>, which means &quot;Williams Thing&quot; in <a>Greek</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulielmensian&quot; /&gt; It was published irregularly in the 1990s, but has been annual for the past several years and dates back to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulielmensian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Numerous smaller campus publications are also produced each year, including <em>The Telos</em>, a journal of Christian thought, <em>The Mad Cow</em>, a humor magazine, and the <em>Literary Review</em>, a literary magazine.</p>
<h4>91.9 WCFM</h4>
<p><a>WCFM</a> is a college-owned, student-run, non-commercial radio station broadcasting from the basement of Prospect House at 91.9&nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring 85 hours per week of original programming, the station features a wide variety of musical genres, in addition to sports and talk radio.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The station may also be heard on the Internet via [[SHOUTcast.com]]. Members of the surrounding communities above the age of 18 are allowed to [[disc jockey|DJ]] on the station, which, as part of its mission, seeks to serve the surrounding community with news and announcements of public interest.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The board of the radio station holds a concert every semester.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<h3>Williams Trivia Contest</h3>
<p>At the end of every semester but one since 1966, WCFM has hosted an all-night, eight-hour <a>trivia</a> contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends, and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team's only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester's contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivia rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The precise date of the debut contest is uncertain. Most spring contests occur in early May, but during its first decade, Williams Trivia was sometimes held in March or February. Assuming a May date, <a>Lawrence University</a>'s 50-hour-long <a>Great Midwest Trivia Contest</a>, first held on April 29, 1966, would be the oldest continuous competition of its sort in the United States, but if the first Williams contest was held earlier, it would be the oldest.  The distinction is appropriately trivial.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </pre>
<p>While other college-based trivia contests in the United States emphasize marathon endurance and revel in the obscurity of their arcana, the aim of the Williams contest is to cram as much evocative and entertaining material into as concentrated a space as possible. Lasting just eight hours, a typical Williams Trivia contest will demand between 900 and 1,200 separate &quot;bits&quot; of trivial information,&lt;ref name=&quot;trivia rules&quot; /&gt; delivering twice as much content as its &quot;competitors&quot; in a fraction of the time. No discernible rivalry exists between any of the various contests. The contest has occasionally received outside media coverage, including in the Sunday <a>New York Times</a>.</p>
<h3>Student music</h3>
<p> Music ensembles at Williams include Berkshire Symphony, Symphonic Winds, Student Symphony, Brass Ensemble, Clarinet Choir, Concert and Chamber Choirs, <a>Handbell</a> Choir, Gospel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, Kusika and the <a>Zambezi</a> <a>Marimba</a> Band, Percussion Ensemble, and Marching Band.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://music.williams.edu/williams-college-music</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Both music majors and non-majors are welcome to participate in all groups.</p>
<p>The Berkshire Symphony is conducted by Ronald Feldman, a former <a>Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> cellist.  Half of the orchestra consists of students, while the principal players and many section players are area professionals.</p>
<p>Williams Symphonic Winds, led by Steven Dennis Bodner, is a leading proponent of new music on campus.  In recent years, the group has evolved to include strings and premieres and performs works by prominent contemporary composers, including members of the faculty.</p>
<p>Student Symphony is an entirely student-run, student-conducted group.  Student Symphony rehearses weekly and performs once per semester.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Bradley Wells, the Concert and Chamber Choirs perform a wide range of repertoire at a variety of concerts.  A choral highlight is always the Festival of Lessons and Carols held just prior to the holidays in the Thompson Memorial Chapel.</p>
<p>The Williams Jazz program includes academic courses, ensembles (both traditional <a>big band</a>, by audition, and several small ensembles), and applied lessons on primary jazz instruments.</p>
<p>In the <a>Shona language</a> of <a>Zimbabwe</a>, Kusika means &quot;to create.&quot;  Founded in 1989 at Williams College, Kusika performs traditional African music, dance, and storytelling from <a>Ghana</a>, <a>Zimbabwe</a>, and <a>Senegal</a>.  The Zambezi Marimba Band, founded in 1992, was the first African marimba band to be established in the Eastern United States. The ensemble plays marimba music from <a>Zambia</a>, <a>Zimbabwe</a>, <a>South Africa</a>, and from the <a>African diaspora</a> around the world. </p>
<p>Sankofa, called &quot;Kofa&quot; for short, is the Williams College Step Team. It is the most popular performing group on campus. It is a co-ed, student-run dance company. Sankofa choreographs original material that incorporates popular song, drums, hip-hop, break dance, spoken word, poetry, and sheer creative ingenuity. Stepping features precise, synchronized, and complex rhythmic body movements, combined with singing, chanting, and verbal play. The word &#x201c;sankofa,&#x201d; from the Akan people in Ghana, loosely translates to &#x201c;reaching back in order to move forward.&#x201d; Sankofa was formed in the fall of the &#x2018;96-&#x2019;97 school year by five women from the class of 2000: Dahra Jackson, Maxine Lyle, Mya Fisher, Melina Evans and Samantha Reed. In 2005, Lyle founded Soul Steps, a professional step company. &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://62center.williams.edu/dance/ensemble.cfm?cid=10</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Williams' coed hip hop dance group &quot;Nuttin' But Cuties&quot;, usually shortened to NBC, is one of the more prominent groups on campus with well-attended shows in the fall and spring semesters.</p>
<p>The Williams Percussion Ensemble, led by Matthew Gold, explores the masterworks of twentieth century percussion music, experimental music, music of many of the world's traditions, and the most up-to-date works by contemporary composers for percussion instruments.</p>
<p>The Marching Band, named &quot;The Moocho Macho Moocow Military Marching Band&quot;, serves as a cheering section at the football games, as well as an entertainment show for halftime. </p>
<p>Williams also hosts seven student-organized <a>a cappella</a> singing groups.  There are two all-female groups, the Accidentals and Ephoria.  The two all-male groups are Octet and the Springstreeters, and the two co-ed pop groups are Ephlats and Good Question.  The seventh group, the Elizabethans, are a mixed-voice Renaissance ensemble.</p>
<p>The Williams Gospel Choir has served the college since 1986. Their performances are usually at the end of the semester, right before finals start, and serve to provide a spiritual and emotional courage to students during this difficult time of the semester.</p>
<h3>School colors and mascot</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The college sign</a> Williams's <a>school colors</a> are purple and gold, with purple as the primary school color.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A story explaining the origin of purple as a school color says that at the Williams-[[Harvard]] [[baseball]] game in 1869, spectators watching from carriages had trouble telling the teams apart because there were no uniforms. One of the onlookers bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams' players, and the only color available was purple. The buyer was [[Jennie Jerome]] (later [[Winston Churchill]]'s mother) whose family summered in Williamstown.&lt;ref name=&quot;joProctor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The Williams <a>college mascot</a> is a <a>purple cow</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;joProctor&quot; /&gt; The mascot's name, Ephelia, was submitted in a radio contest in October 1952 by <a>Theodore W. Friend</a>, a senior at Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;purple cow&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the cow mascot are unknown, but one possibility is that it was inspired by the ''Purple Cow'' humor magazine, a student publication begun in 1907, which used the college color along with a cow.&lt;ref name=&quot;purple cow&quot; /&gt; The title of the humor magazine was in reference to [[Gelett Burgess]]'s nonsense poem:</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>I never saw a purple cow &lt;br&gt; I never hope to see one; &lt;br&gt; But I can tell you, anyhow, &lt;br&gt; I'd rather see than be one! &lt;br&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Alma Mater</h3>
<p>Williams claims the first <em><a>alma mater</a></em> song written by an undergraduate, &quot;The Mountains,&quot; was by <a>Washington Gladden</a> of the class of 1859.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<h3>Mountain Day</h3>
<p>On one of the first three Fridays in October, the president of the college cancels classes and declares it <a>Mountain Day</a>. The bells ring, announcing the event, and students hike up <a>Stony Ledge</a>.</p>
<p>The first known mention of Mountain Day was made by Williams president <a>Edward Dorr Griffin</a> in his notebook on college business. He wrote, under 'Holidays': &quot;About the 24th of June a day to go to the mountain. If not then about the 14th of July. Prayers at night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2009, with the threat of bad weather for each of the first three Fridays of the month, Interim-president Wagner declared &quot;Siberian Mountain Day.&quot; Festivities were relocated from Stony Ledge to the much more accessible Stone Hill.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The school's athletic teams are called the Ephs (rhymes with &quot;chiefs&quot;), a shortening of the first name of founder <a>Ephraim Williams</a>.  They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division III</a> and the <a>New England Small College Athletic Conference</a> (NESCAC). Williams also competes in <a>skiing</a> and <a>squash</a> at the <a>Division I</a> level. Williams is ranked first among Division III schools for athletic spending per student.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Equity in Athletics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Williams has a traditional rivalry with <a>Amherst College</a> and <a>Wesleyan University</a>.  The &quot;<a>Little Three</a>&quot;, a subset of <a>NESCAC</a>, comprises the three schools. Williams and Amherst participate in notably intense competition, dating back more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although Williams College typically sports purple and gold as their school colors, purple is in fact the only school color. The gold was added in order to differentiate its colors from that of rival school Amherst's purple and white uniforms. On May 3, 2009, Williams and Amherst alumni played a game of <a>vintage baseball</a> at <a>Wahconah Park</a> according to 1859-rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first <a>college baseball</a> game played on July 2, 1859 between the two schools. Amherst-alumnus <a>Dan Duquette</a> was instrumental in organizing the event.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Traditionally, Williams varsity teams sing the song &quot;Yard By Yard&quot; on the eve of every game: </p>
<p>: Yard by yard we'll fight our way  : Thro' Amherst's line,  : Every man on every play,  : Striving all the time.  : Cheer on cheer will rend the air,  : All behind our men.  : And we'll fight for dear old Williams  : And we'll win and win again.</p>
<p>Until 1994, Williams was not permitted, by NESCAC rules, to compete in team NCAA competition. The Williams women's <a>swimming</a> and <a>diving</a> team won the school's first national title in 1981, and claimed the title in 1982 as well.  Williams played in the 2003, 2004, and 2010 men's basketball Division III national championship games, winning the title in March 2003. Men's <a>basketball</a> also played in the 1997 and 1998 Final Fours.  Williams was the first New England basketball team to have won a Division III championship, and since they have been eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament, no team in the country has played in more Final Fours.</p>
<p>Williams teams to win national titles since Williams began participating in NCAA tournaments in 1994 include women's <a>crew</a> (six titles), men's <a>tennis</a> (three), women's tennis (five), men's <a>cross country</a> (two), women's cross country (two), men's basketball, women's indoor <a>track and field</a>, and men's <a>soccer</a>. Other perennial contenders in NCAA tournaments include women's <a>lacrosse</a>, women's <a>volleyball</a>, women's soccer, women's <a>field hockey</a>, men's <a>golf</a>, men's and women's swimming and diving and men's track and field.</p>
<p>Williams also has had success winning the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a>, presented to the institution within each NCAA division that has the greatest overall success in NCAA sanctioned-championships.  Williams has won the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a> 14 of the 15 years since its inception, including the last 12 in a row.</p>
<p>In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 the college achieved #1 rankings in both academics and athletics within its peer groups (liberal arts colleges as ranked by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> and NCAA Division III institutions as ranked by the Director's Cup calculations, respectively).  Dual #1 rankings in any single year was an unprecedented achievement among the 1,053 NCAA member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Williams has an active club and intramural sports program, offering 13 club sports including <a>ultimate</a>, <a>rugby</a>, <a>horseback riding</a>, <a>cycling</a>, <a>fencing</a>, volleyball, <a>gymnastics</a>, <a>sailing</a>, and <a>water polo</a>.  Approximately 50% of Williams' students compete on at least one varsity, junior varsity, or formal club team.</p>

<p>Williams has 315 voting faculty, 96% of whom possess a <a>doctorate</a> or the terminal degree in their field.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Students fill out course surveys at the end of each semester, which play a large role in determining faculty [[tenure]] decisions. Recently, there has been controversy over popular teachers being denied tenure based on other factors, including publication rates.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.williamsrecord.com/wr/?view=article&amp;section=news&amp;id=8830</a> Williams Record ARCHIVES: April 18 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>

<h3>Alumni</h3>
<p>The Society of Alumni of Williams College is the oldest existing alumni society of any academic institution in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Williams Club&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society of Alumni was founded during the &quot;Amherst crisis&quot; in 1821, when Williams College President [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]] left Williams.  Graduates of Williams formed the Society to ensure that Williams would not have to close, and raised enough money to ensure the future survival of the school.</pre>
<p>Not affiliated with the Society of Alumni, but also serving the college's alumni is the <a>Williams Club</a> in <a>New York City</a>.  Located at 24 East 39th Street in <a>Manhattan</a>, the club is open to the paying public as a hotel and restaurant, and operates as a meeting space for Williams alumni living in and visiting the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Williams Club&quot; /&gt; </p>
<p>Williams has produced 37 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, the most of any liberal arts college in the country.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford</h2>
<p>Williams has a close relationship with <a>Exeter College</a>, one of the oldest constituent <a>colleges</a> of <a>Oxford University</a>.  In the early 1980s, Williams purchased a group of houses, today known as the Ephraim Williams House, on Banbury Road and Lathbury Road, in <a>North Oxford</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  </p>
<p>The Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford (WEPO) was founded in 1985.  Originally twenty six undergraduate students from Williams spend their junior year at Exeter each year as full members of the college but since 2010 this has been reduced to twenty four due to budget cuts.</p>
