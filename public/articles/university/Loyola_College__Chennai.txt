The Arts/Humanities stream includes English, Economics, History, Tamil and Sociology. Science courses offered include Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology and Computer Science. Commerce is also a much sought after stream at Loyola. The college was ranked the number one college or institution for Science degrees in India by <em><a>India Today</a></em> magazine in <a>2003</a>, <a>2004</a>, <a>2005</a>, and <a>2006</a>.

Undergraduate students have to pass all examinations and obtain at least 90 credits in three years to be eligible for award of a degree. Non-academic credits are also required of all students, and a wide range of extra-curricular and social service options offer them that choice.</p>
