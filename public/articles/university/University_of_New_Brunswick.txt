<p>The <strong>University of New Brunswick</strong> (<strong>UNB</strong>) is a Canadian university located in the province of <a>New Brunswick</a>. UNB is the oldest English language university in Canada and the first public university in North America.&lt;ref name = facts&gt;University of New Brunswick <a>UNB Quick Facts</a>. Retrieved on: August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The university has two main campuses: the original campus founded in 1785 in <a>Fredericton</a> and a smaller campus which was opened in <a>Saint John</a> in 1964. In addition, there are two small satellite health sciences campuses located in <a>Moncton</a> and <a>Bathurst, New Brunswick</a>, and two offices in the <a>Caribbean</a> and in <a>Beijing</a>. UNB offers over 60 degrees at the <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> levels with a total student enrollment of approximately 12,000 between the two principal campuses. The university presses, The Baron and The Brunswickan, are members of <a>CUP</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>

Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica. Retrieved on: August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, the Provincial Academy of Arts and Science became the College of New Brunswick (Anglican).&lt;ref name = Kernaghan/&gt; King's College was established at <a>Fredericton, New Brunswick</a> in 1828 under the control of the <a>Church of England</a>.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bourinot, G.

<p>The governance of UNB was modeled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty) responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to provide institutional leadership.&lt;ref name = Anisef/&gt; In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law, and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name = Anisef/&gt;</p>
<p>By 1920, the University of New Brunswick had two faculties: Arts, and Applied Science. It awarded the degrees of <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> (BA), <a>Bachelor of Science</a> (BSc), <a>Master of Arts</a> (MA), and <a>Doctor of Science</a> (DSc). The latter was awarded only in <a>civil engineering</a>, <a>electrical engineering</a> and <a>forestry</a>. It had 156 male students and 21 female students, and only eleven academic staff, all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, <em>Canada Year Book 1921</em>, Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building on the campus of the University of New Brunswick. Originally built as a science building in 1924, the Memorial Hall honours the 35 UNB Alumni who died in the <a>First World War</a>. &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.unb.ca/welcome/maps/fredericton/show.php?id=66</a> War Memorial Hall&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Several stained glass windows in the Convocation Hall at the University of New Brunswick were created by Robert McCausland Limited: <a>Robert Burns</a> medallion (1928), &quot;<a>Sir Galahad</a>&quot; (1925), &quot;<a>Long fellow</a>&quot; (1930), Lt. Thomas Carleton; Sir Howard Douglas; and emblems (1942). </p>
<p>In the 1960s University policies changed in response to social pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref name = Anisef/&gt; In 1964, a second, smaller campus was established in <a>Saint John, New Brunswick</a>.&lt;ref name = Countryman/&gt; The growth of the UNBSJ campus is particularly notable, considering it began in 1964 with only 96 students spread throughout various buildings in Saint John's central business district. By the late 1960s, the Saint John Law School was moved to UNBF to become the <a>University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law</a>, and in 1968 UNBSJ moved into its new campus at Tucker Park. The <a>Association of University of New Brunswick Teachers (AUNBT)</a> was established in 1954; in 1979 it became the bargaining agent for full-time academic staff and in 2008 achieved certification for contract academic staff. In 1980, the university offered the first <a>Elderhostel</a> program in Canada.</p>
<p>Both campuses have undergone significant expansion over the years and many University buildings have received funding from <a>Lord Beaverbrook</a> and other prominent industrialists and philanthropists. UNB's largest expansion coincided with the <a>Baby boom</a>, and its Fredericton campus tripled in size. In 1973 the <a>New Brunswick Teachers' College</a> (now the Faculty of Education) was absorbed into UNB. Originally a department in the Arts faculty, the <a>University of New Brunswick Faculty of Business Administration</a> was formed in 1980 and is a major supplier of management education. In 1989, University of New Brunswick established undergraduate degrees in adult education.</p>
<p>Currently UNBF has approximately 9,000 students while UNBSJ has 3,000, although UNBSJ is growing at a faster rate. </p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>UNB Fredericton is located on the banks of the <a>St. John River</a>. The campus is well-known for its colourful fall foliage, Georgian style red-brick buildings and a very steep hill. UNB Fredericton has shared the &quot;College Hill&quot; with <a>St. Thomas University</a> (STU) since 1964, when the former St. Thomas College moved from Chatham, NB (now <a>Miramichi</a>). They share some infrastructure but remain separate institutions.</p>
<p>The UNB Saint John campus (UNBSJ) is located in Tucker Park in the <a>Millidgeville</a> neighbourhood, several kilometres north of the city's central business district, and offers spectacular views of the Kennebecasis River and Grand Bay. New Brunswick's largest health care facility, <a>Saint John Regional Hospital</a>, is located adjacent to the UNBSJ campus. In 2010, a new medical school, a joint project between <a>Dalhousie University</a>, UNBSJ, and the Regional Hospital, will take in its first class.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>University of New Brunswick has attempted to reduce its environmental impact through installing a natural gas burning microturbine at the Central Heating Plant that produces 100&nbsp;kW of electricity for the university.&lt;ref name=&quot; Campus Sustainability Projects&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Heat energy, a result of this process, is used to contribute to the overall heating of the campus to increase its overall energy efficiency.  In addition, all produce and dairy products used within its dining services are obtained from local farmers and local producers.&lt;ref name=&quot; University of New Brunswick 2009 Green Report Card&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With these efforts to create a more sustainable campus, University of New Brunswick received an overall &quot;C&quot; grade in the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card put out by the Sustainable Endowment&#x2019;s Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<h2>Building history</h2>
<p><a>Sir Howard Douglas Hall</a>, which is commonly known as the 'Old Arts' building on the Fredericton campus, is the oldest university building still in use in Canada.</p>
<p>The first astronomical observatory in Canada, the Brydone-Jack observatory lies adjacent to Sir Howard Douglas Hall and was first operational in 1851. The observatory was named after William Brydone-Jack, a professor of mathematics and later president of the university. Due to the work done by Brydone-Jack at this observatory, Fredericton was the first location in Canada that had its longitude accurately determined.</p>
<p>In celebration of UNB&#x2019;s 225th anniversary, John Leroux, was commissioned to write an architectural history of the University&#x2019;s two campuses. <em>Building a University: The Architecture of UNB</em>, published by <a>Goose Lane Editions</a>, is illustrated with archival and contemporary photographs, and traces the development of each campus, highlighting UNB&#x2019;s most treasured and iconic buildings.</p>
<h2>Institute of Biomedical Engineering</h2>
<p>The Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) on the Fredericton campus is one of the leading research institutes in biomedical engineering in Canada. It was founded in 1965 as the Bio-Engineering Institute, making it one of the oldest research institutes to be solely dedicated to the field of biomedical engineering. The institute is also the region's prosthetic fitting centre where amputees are fitted with state-of-the-art intelligent artificial limbs. The institute also carries out research in the field of myoelectric signal processing, biomedical instrumentation and human <a>motion analysis</a>. The IBME also developed the UNB Test of Prosthetic Function which is used by researchers all over the world. Although the institute does not offer degrees in biomedical engineering, students at UNB usually enroll in one of the other faculties of engineering such as electrical or mechanical and pursue their research in biomedical engineering at the IBME.</p>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
<p>UNB gives away four million dollars worth of scholarships each year.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;UNB's TV Ads&quot;</a>, UNB website, retrieved August 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The most prestigious of these are the <a>Blake-Kirkpatrick</a>, <a>Beaverbrook</a>, and President's scholarships. UNB has a scholarship guarantee in which any admitted student with an average of 80% or higher will receive a guaranteed amount of five hundred dollars, or more depending on their marks.&lt;ref&gt;University of New Brunswick. <a>Guaranteed Scholarship Program</a>. Retrieved on: September 26. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>UNB Fredericton is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the <a>UNB Varsity Reds</a> while UNBSJ is represented by <a>UNBSJ Seawolves</a>. UNBF used to have different names for each individual sport's team; for instance, the men's swim team was the Beavers, and the hockey team was the Red Devils.</p>
<p>A variety of sports teams are organized as &quot;club&quot; teams, supported financially by the Student Union as well as by individual members of the team. These club teams do not use the Varsity Reds name, and continue the tradition of different nicknames for each sport. Sports at the club level include rugby, field hockey &quot;Redsticks&quot; baseball, cheer leading, Cross Country Running, and the Woodsmen (among others). The UNB men's rugby team is known as the Ironmen, and boast numerous New Brunswick and Maritime championships at the 'A' and 'B' levels of competition. UNB has recently decided to only invest in eight of varsity teams and move the others to competitive sport club status within the Campus Recreation program. This reorganization took effect in the 2008-09 academic year. This means that some current national athletes will no longer be able to compete for UNB.</p>
<p>The UNB wrestling team is known as the Black Bears, and has produced several CIAU/CIS medals, as well as a record 15 consecutive AUAA titles from 1987-2002. </p>
<p>St. Thomas and UNBF have a fierce rivalry in men's ice hockey and a growing one in women's ice hockey. These &quot;Battle of the Hill&quot; games are among the most attended. UNBF has won three <a>University Cup</a>s (<a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> hockey championships), one in 1998, one in 2007 and one in 2009, making them the current champions.</p>
<p>In 2005, the UNB Cricket Club organized the initial UNB Cricket Cup, which took place in October. Featuring teams from several Residences on campus, it is believed that it is the first of its kind to take place at UNB. The tournament was won by Harrison House who chased a target of over 150 to beat McLeod by a margin of 1 wicket. All games, of innings comprising 10 overs, took place at Queen's Square Ball Field in Fredericton. The trophy is proudly displayed in the Harrison lounge.  In 2007, UNBCC grew to almost 40 members making it arguably the biggest cricket club in the Atlantic Provinces.</p>
<h3>Songs</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are: Carmina Universitatis Novi Brunsvici; 'Alma Mater' (1904); and 'UNB Anthem' with words by A.G. Bailey and music by D.V. Start.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. <a>College Songbooks and Songs - University of New Brunswick</a>. Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. Historia.

<h2>Residence traditions</h2>
<h3>Aitken House Club Med</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Aitken House Crest</a> <a>Aitken House</a>'s Club Med is one of the better known UNB residence traditions. It is a beach party held during the first week in November. It consists of every single resident within the house forming a production line, where 20&#x2013;25 tonnes of sand is brought into the house basement. The sand is left to dry for several days, and decorations are put into place. Then a massive beach party takes place, where in previous years anywhere from 150 to 300 people have shown up to party in this 53-room residence.</p>
<h3>Neville/Jones House Bed Push</h3>
<p>The annual Neville/Jones House Bed Push is a marathon event used to raise money for Women in Transition House, Inc. (WITH), a local shelter for abused women and children. After a door-to-door fundraising campaign, the Norsemen of Neville and Gentlement of Jones travel to Saint John, NB where they construct a bed on wheels and set off on provincial highways to push the bed 100&nbsp;km to Fredericton, overnight&#x2014;a 12-hour running journey. Since its inception, the Bed Push has grown to become the largest student-run fundraiser at UNB, having donated over $200,000 to the transition house, including a student fundraising record of $31,200 in 2007.</p>
<h3>Harrison House Pumpkin Sacrifice</h3>
<p>The Great Pumpkin Sacrifice is a unique tradition that has been in existence since 1973 at <a>Harrison House</a>, a now co-ed dormitory located at the centre of the campus. As part of the ceremony, a large pumpkin is carried around campus, lit and then thrown off the residence roof in a fiery explosion. The pumpkin itself is carved with a unique three-eyed face that is simultaneously frowning and smiling on the onlooker. The sacrifice is made in the hopes for a good academic harvest. </p>
<p>The tradition began on Halloween 1973, when a small group of students threw pumpkins off the roof of the residence.</p>
<h3>Bridges Polar Dip</h3>
<p>The Bridges Polar Dip is an annual fund raising event typically held in late February in which residents of Bridges House gather pledges with the promise that they will jump into a pool of ice-cold water outside in the middle of winter. Since 2005, the polar dip has been raising money for the <a>IWK Health Centre</a> in Halifax, NS. As there are many people that perform this dip, in recent years the entertainment value of this event has been elevated by the individuals dressing up in various costumes ranging from super heroes such as <a>Batman</a> and <a>Captain Planet</a>, Greek togas and full scuba gear.</p>
<h3>Neill House Raise a Little Hell</h3>
<p>Neill House's Raise a Little Hell is a day of celebrations and donations. Fund raising is done throughout the city as well as on the UNB campus. The biggest on-campus fundraiser is the Head Shave and Pie Your Proctor event at McConnell Dining Hall. Camping on the Roof is another fundraiser that is done each February.  A small group of residents is chosen to camp out on the deck at Nicky Zee's Night Club for a weekend.  During this weekend residents will panhandle throughout downtown. All funds raised are donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.</p>
<h3>MacKenzie House Caber Toss</h3>
<p>Residence of MacKenzie House undergo training sessions in preparation to toss cabers infront of the ResLife building.  Money raised from this event is donated to The Boys and Girls Club.</p>
