<p>The <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Penn</strong> or <strong>UPenn</strong>) is a <a>private</a> <a>Ivy League</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>USA</a>. Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of <a>higher education</a>&lt;ref&gt;Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. Penn, <a>Princeton</a>, and <a>Columbia</a> originated within a few years of each other. In 1899, Penn officially changed its &quot;founding&quot; date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank. See <a>Building Penn's Brand</a> for the reasons why Penn did this. <a>Princeton University</a> implicitly challenges this [<a>http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/</a>], also claiming to be fourth. Penn was chartered in 1755, making it the sixth-oldest chartered, following Princeton (1746) and Columbia (1754). A Presbyterian minister operated a &quot;Log College&quot; in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) which would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740. However, Princeton has not done so, and a Princeton historian says that &quot;the facts do not warrant&quot; such an interpretation. [<a>http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; in the <a>United States</a>, and is one of several institutions that claims to have been the <a>first university in America</a>. Penn is a member of the <a>Ivy League</a> and is one of the <a>Colonial Colleges</a>.</p>
<p><a>Benjamin Franklin</a>, Penn's founder, advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the classics and theology. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple &quot;faculties&quot; (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Penn offers a broad range of academic departments, an extensive research enterprise and a number of community outreach and public service programs. It houses a <a>medical school</a>, <a>dental school</a>, <a>business school</a>, <a>law school</a>, nursing school, veterinary school, social sciences and humanities programs, as well as biomedical teaching and research capabilities. Its undergraduate programs are also among the most selective in the country.</p>
<p>In <a>FY</a>2009, Penn's academic research programs undertook more than $730 million in research, involving some 3,800 faculty, 1,000 postdoctoral fellows and 5,400 support staff/graduate assistants. Much of the funding is provided by the <a>National Institutes of Health</a> for biomedical research. Penn tops the Ivy League in annual spending, with a projected 2009 budget of $5.542 billion.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it ranked fifth among U.S. universities in fundraising, bringing in about $475.96 million in private support.&lt;ref&gt;Charitable contributions to colleges and universities in the United States grew by 6.2 percent in 2008 [<a>http://www.cae.org/content/pdf/VSE_2008_Survey_Press_Release_with_Tables.pdf</a>]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Incorporated as <em>The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania</em>, Penn is one of 14 founding members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:College Hall and Ben Franklin Statue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Benjamin Franklin Statue, in front of College Hall. The light on in the upper left window is from the [[Philomathean Society]], Penn's first student group.]]</p>
<p>In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the evangelist <a>George Whitefield</a>. Designed and built by <a>Edmund Woolley</a>, it was the largest building in the city and it was also planned to serve as a charity school. The fundraising, however, fell short and although the building was erected, the plans for both a chapel and the charity school were suspended. In the fall of 1749, eager to create a college to educate future generations, <a>Benjamin Franklin</a> circulated a pamphlet titled &quot;Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania,&quot; his vision for what he called a &quot;Public Academy of Philadelphia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first drew up a proposal for establishing the academy, &quot;thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution.&quot; Unlike the other <a>Colonial colleges</a> that existed in 1743&#x2014;<a>Harvard</a>, <a>William and Mary</a>, and <a>Yale</a>&#x2014;Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy. He advocated an innovative concept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and doing public service. The proposed program of study became the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum.</p>
<p>Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of <a>Philadelphia</a>, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749) the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from <a>Independence Hall</a> was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. On February 1, 1750 the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. In 1751 the Academy, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first students. A charity school also was opened in accordance with the intentions of the original &quot;New Building&quot; donors, although it lasted only a few years.</p>
<p><a>300px|left|thumb|Quad in the Fall, facing Ware College House</a>For its date of founding, the University uses 1740, the date of &quot;the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney, Edward Potts. <em>History of the University of Pennsylvania 1740&#x2013;1940</em> University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia. 1940. pp 46&#x2013;48.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The institution was known as the <strong>College of Philadelphia</strong> from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the <a>Rev. William Smith's</a> <a>loyalist</a> tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a <strong><a>University of the State of Pennsylvania</a></strong>.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791 the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> with twelve men from each institution on the new board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These three schools were part of the same institution and were overseen by the same board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Penn has three claims to being the <a>first university in the United States</a>, according to university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America made Penn the first institution to offer both &quot;undergraduate&quot; and professional education; the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of &quot;University&quot;; and existing colleges were established as seminaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;first university&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the <a>Schuylkill River</a> to property purchased from the <a>Blockley Almshouse</a> in <a>West Philadelphia</a> in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as <a>University City</a>.</p>
<h3>Educational innovations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|College Hall and Cohen Hall viewed from Woodland Ave., ca. 1892.</a></p>
<p>Penn's educational innovations include: the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the <a>Wharton School</a>, the world's first collegiate school of business, in 1881; the first American student union building, <a>Houston Hall</a>, in 1896;&lt;ref&gt;<em>Building America's First University: An Historical and Architectural Guide to the University of Pennsylvania</em> George E. Thomas, David Bruce Brownlee, p3&lt;/ref&gt; the country's second school of veterinary medicine; and the home of <a>ENIAC</a>, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning <a>psychology</a> department in North America and is where the <a>American Medical Association</a> was founded.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Motto</h3>
<p>Penn's motto is based on a line from <a>Horace</a>&#x2019;s III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), <em>quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?</em> (&quot;of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?&quot;) From 1756 to 1898, the motto read <em>Sine Moribus Vanae</em>. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as &quot;Loose women without morals,&quot; the university quickly changed the motto to <em>literae sine moribus vanae</em> (&quot;Letters without morals [are] useless&quot;). In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised, and as part of the redesign it was decided that the new motto &quot;mutilated&quot; Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, <em>Leges Sine Moribus Vanae</em> (&quot;Laws without morals [are] useless&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Colors</h3>
<p>The official school colors are red with <a>hex</a> value #990000, and blue with hex value #011F5B.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In printed materials they are <a>PMS</a> 201 red and PMS 288 blue.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Overlooking Lower Quad from Upper Quad</a> Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the <a>Cope &amp; Stewardson</a> firm, whose principal architects combined the <a>Gothic architecture</a> of the <a>University of Oxford</a> and the <a>University of Cambridge</a> with the local landscape to establish the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style. The present core campus covers over  in a contiguous area of <a>West Philadelphia</a>'s <a>University City</a> district; the older heart of the campus comprises the <a>University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District</a>. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants and pubs, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus.</p>
<p>The Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th &amp; Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/4/7/</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Penn acquired about  between the campus and the Schuylkill River (the former site of the <a>Philadelphia Civic Center</a> and a nearby  site owned by the <a>United States Postal Service</a>). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south. It encompasses the main U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets (the retail post office at the east end of the building will remain open), the Postal Annex between Chestnut Street and Walnut Street, the Vehicle Maintenance Facility Garage along Chestnut Street and the  of surface parking south of Walnut Street. Over the next decade, the site will become the home to educational, research, <a>biomedical</a>, and <a>mixed-use</a> facilities. Penn also plans new connections between the campus and the city, including a pedestrian bridge. In 2010 Penn, in its first significant expansion across the <a>Schuylkill River</a>, purchased 23 acres from <a>DuPont</a> for storage and office space.</p>
<p><a>thumb|350px|left|Upper Quad Gate.</a></p>
<p>The University also owns the  <a>Morris Arboretum</a> in <a>Chestnut Hill</a> in northwestern <a>Philadelphia</a>, the official arboretum of the state of <a>Pennsylvania</a>. Penn also owns the  <a>New Bolton Center</a>, the research and large-animal health care center of its Veterinary School. Located near <a>Kennett Square, Pennsylvania</a>, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when <a>Kentucky Derby</a> winner <a>Barbaro</a> underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the <a>Preakness Stakes</a>.</p>
<p>Penn borders <a>Drexel University</a> and is near the <a>University of the Sciences in Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<h3>Libraries===&lt;!-- This section is linked from <a>NeXT</a> --&gt;</h3>
<p>[[Image:FisherFineArtsLibrary.JPG|thumb|280px|right|[[Fisher Fine Arts Library]], also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]] Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Louis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost <a>William Smith</a> sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. More than 250 years later, it has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 FTE employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million. The library system holds 5.76 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.15 million <a>microform</a> items.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Penn's Libraries, with associated school or subject area: Annenberg (School of Communications), located in the Annenberg School; Biddle (Law), located in the Law School; Biomedical, located adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School; Chemistry, located in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; Dental Medicine; Engineering, located on the second floor of the Towne Building in the Engineering School; Fine Arts, located within the <a>Fisher Fine Arts Library</a>, designed by <a>Frank Furness</a>; Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, located on Walnut Street at Washington Square; Lea Library, located within the Van Pelt Library; Lippincott (Wharton School), located on the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; Math/Physics/Astronomy, located on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; Museum (Anthropology); Rare Books and Manuscripts; <a>Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center</a> (Humanities and Social Sciences) - location of <a>Weigle Information Commons</a>; Veterinary Medicine, located in Penn Campus and New Bolton Center; and High Density Storage.</p>
<h3>The University Museum</h3>
<p> The University Museum was founded in 1887. During the early twentieth century UPM conducted some of the first and most important archaeological and anthropological expeditions to Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turkey, Africa, East Asia and South America, thus the collection includes a very large number of antiquities from ancient Egypt and the Middle East. Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the <a>royal tombs of Ur</a>. The museum also has a strong collection of Chinese artifacts. Features of its <a>Beaux-Arts</a> building include a dramatic <a>rotunda</a> and gardens that include Egyptian <a>papyrus</a>. The Penn Museum participates in scientific research focusing on the application of modern scientific techniques to aid the interpretation of archaeological contexts.</p>
<p>The <a>Institute of Contemporary Art</a>, which is based on Penn's campus, showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p>University residences include DuBois College House, Fisher Hassenfeld College House (formerly Woodland), Gregory College House, Harnwell College House, Harrison College House,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Hill College House</a>, Kings Court English College House, Riepe College House (formerly Spruce House), Rodin College House (formerly Hamilton College House), Sansom Place East and West, Stouffer College House and Ware College House. Within the college houses, Penn has nearly forty themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology.</p>
<p>Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after freshman year, as well as by graduate and professional students.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate schools</h3>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania has four undergraduate schools:<a>250px|right|thumb|Lower Quad in Winter, from Riepe College House</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Nursing</a></li>
  <li><a>The Wharton School</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences, which also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, Penn's division for non-traditional undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers joint-degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's &quot;One University&quot; policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools, except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at <a>Bryn Mawr</a>, <a>Haverford</a>, and <a>Swarthmore</a>, under a reciprocal agreement known as the <a>Quaker Consortium</a>.</p>
<h3>Graduate and professional schools</h3>
<p>The following schools offer graduate programs:<a>thumb|300px|right|University of Pennsylvania Dental School</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Annenberg School for Communication</a></li>
  <li>Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences</li>
  <li><a>Graduate School of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>Law School</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Dental Medicine</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Design</a> (formerly the Graduate School of Fine Arts)</li>
  <li><a>School of Engineering and Applied Science</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Medicine</a></li>
  <li><a>School of Nursing</a></li>
  <li>School of Social Policy &amp; Practice</li>
  <li>School of Veterinary Medicine</li>
  <li><a>The Wharton School</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Coordinated dual-degree and interdisciplinary programs</h3>
<p>Penn offers specialized <a>coordinated dual-degree</a> (CDD) programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the University upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>The Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology</a></li>
  <li><a>The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business</a></li>
  <li>Nursing and Health Care Management</li>
  <li><a>The Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management</a></li>
  <li>Accelerated 7 year Dental Program</li>
</ul>
<p>Dual-degree programs which lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, &quot;dual degree&quot; students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as a Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Some students in the <a>Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences</a> can submatriculate into master's-level programs in the sciences.</p>
<p>For graduate programs, there are many formalized joint-degree graduate programs such as a joint J.D./MBA. Penn is also the home to interdisciplinary institutions such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, and the Executive Master's in Technology Management Program.</p>
<h3>Academic medical center and biomedical research complex</h3>
<p>Penn's health-related programs&#x2014;including the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine, and programs in bioengineering (School of Engineering) and health management (the Wharton School)&#x2014;are among the university's strongest academic components. The combination of intellectual breadth, research funding (each of the health sciences schools ranks in the top 5 in annual NIH funding), clinical resources and overall scale ranks Penn with only a small handful of peer universities in the U.S.</p>
<p>The size of Penn's biomedical research organization, however, adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations, and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and <a>Medicaid</a>/<a>Medicare</a> program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the University of Pennsylvania Health System, thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.</p>
<h3>Admissions selectivity</h3>
<p>Penn is one of the most selective universities in the United States. For the Class of 2014 entering in the fall of 2010, the University received a record-setting 26,938 applications and admitted 14.2 percent of the applicants, marking Penn's most selective admissions cycle in the history of the University.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Penn consistently ranks among the 10 toughest schools to get into, according to the <em>Princeton Review</em>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <em><a>The Atlantic</a></em> also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country.</p>
<p>At the graduate level, Penn's admissions rates, like most universities', vary considerably based on school and program. Based on admission statistics from <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, and veterinary), and its business school.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p> <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked Penn #5 (tied with <a>Stanford</a>) for undergraduate education in its 2011 review. Penn is ranked fifth in the Ivy League behind <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Yale</a> and <a>Columbia</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Penn was ranked #4 by <em>U.S. News</em> in 2005 and 2010, and #6 in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2010 Penn ranked 19th in the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and 12th in the <a>QS World University Rankings</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World University Rankings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Penn placed 15th on the <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>'s Academic Ranking of World Universities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the <a>Mines ParisTech</a> International Professional Ranking, Penn ranks 7th (tied with <a>University of Oxford</a> and <a>Duke University</a>), and 3rd nationally only behind Harvard and Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Measuring University Performance ranks Penn in its top cluster of research universities in the nation, tied with <a>Columbia</a>, Harvard, <a>MIT</a>, and <a>Stanford</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Penn was also ranked 9th by the <a>National Science Foundation</a> in terms of R&amp;D expenditures topping all other Ivy League Schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> ranked Penn 17th overall, and 4th among private institutions (behind <a>Cornell</a>, Stanford, and MIT) on its list of universities' contributions to national service (Research: total research spending; Ph.D.s granted in science and engineering; Community Service: the number of students in ROTC, Peace Corps, etc.; and social mobility: percentage of, and support for, Pell grant recipients).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes.com ranked Penn #36 on their 2010 edition of &quot;America's Best Colleges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania's undergraduate business program at Wharton has retained its #1 ranking in U.S. News for many years. According to MINE ParisTech rankings in 2008, University of Pennsylvania is one of the top five universities in the world, just behind <a>Tokyo University</a>, <a>Harvard University</a>, <a>Stanford University</a>, and <a>Keio University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Undergraduate programs</h3>
<p>Penn's arts and science programs are all well regarded, with many departments ranked amongst the nation's top 10. At the undergraduate level, <a>Wharton</a>, Penn's business school, and Penn's nursing school have maintained their #1, 2 or 3 rankings since <em>U.S. News</em> began reviewing such programs. In the School of Engineering, top departments are <a>bioengineering</a> (typically ranked in the top 5 by <em>U.S. News</em>), <a>mechanical engineering</a>, <a>chemical engineering</a> and <a>nanotechnology</a>. The school is also strong in some areas of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3>Graduate and professional programs</h3>
<p>Penn's graduate schools are among the most distinguished schools in their fields. Penn's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is generally regarded as one of the top schools in the nation (see 1995 rankings by the <a>National Research Council</a>). A study updated the NRC rankings and adjusted them for faculty size and also factored out reputational surveys (saying that such surveys were lagging indicators of academic quality). That study, &quot;The Rise of American Research Universities: Elites and Challengers in the Postwar Era,&quot; ranked Penn's arts, humanities, and sciences departments 7th in the US.</p>
<p>Among its professional schools, the schools of <a>business</a>, <a>communication</a>, <a>dentistry</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>nursing</a>, and veterinary medicine rank in the top 5 nationally (see <em>U.S. News</em> and National Research Council). Penn's <a>Law School</a> is ranked 7th, and its <a>School of Education</a> and University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy &amp; Practice (SP2)|School of Social Policy &amp; Practice (SP2) are ranked in the top 10 (see <em>U.S. News</em>). In the 2009 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Penn was ranked 2nd in North America.</p>

<h3>Selected student organizations</h3>
<p>The <a>Philomathean Society</a>, founded in 1813, is the United States' oldest continuously-existing collegiate literary society. The student-run TV station UTV13 is the oldest college TV station in the country. The <a>Mask and Wig Club</a> is the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. <a>The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club</a>, founded in 1862, is one of the oldest continually operating collegiate choruses in the United States. Its best-known and longest-serving director was <a>Bruce Montgomery</a>, who led the club from 1956 until 2000.</p>
<p><a>The University of Pennsylvania Band</a> has been a part of student life since 1897. The Penn Band performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>) throughout the year. It has a current membership of approximately 80 students. &quot;<a>The Red and the Blue</a>&quot; and &quot;Fight On Pennsylvania&quot; are notable songs commonly played and sung at university events and games.</p>

<h3>Religious life</h3>
<p>Unlike many of its Ivy peers, Penn was not founded with the intention of preparing men for ministerial vocations, nor was the university affiliated with any one particular religious body. Franklin envisioned an institution that would provide students with a liberal arts education: not devoid of religion, but including religion as one among many fields of study.</p>
<p>As a result, Penn has no central area for religious worship and does not supply funding for religious groups, although it does maintain adequate resources for religious students. Its Office of the Chaplain hosts three staff members including the University Chaplain and Associate Chaplain, in addition to an Interfaith Fellow. Penn recognizes more than 40 religiously affiliated student groups and another 40 campus ministries and local congregations connected to campus life, although without monetary support. PRISM (Programs in Religious, Interfaith, and Spirituality Matters)] serves as the representative of all undergraduate faith organizations to the university and facilitates interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and events. PRISM has led the MAJIC trip to New Orleans over Spring Break two of the past three years.</p>
<p>Large campus religious groups include Hillel for Jewish students, <a>Newman Center</a> for Catholics, Muslim Students Association (MSA), Hindu Student Council/Young Jains of America (HSC/YJA), Penn Students for Christ (PSC), Intervarsity Christian Fellowship (PennIV), the <a>Christian Association</a> (CA), the World Peace Buddhists @ Penn (WPB@P), Grace Covenant Church, and the Chabad Lubavitch House.</p>
<p>The Newman Center is the oldest Newman campus ministry in the country, and owns its own complex one block from campus. Penn Hillel's Steinhardt Hall is the largest Hillel building of any college or university in the country.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian Association has produced notable ministers and scholars including <a>Harvey Cox</a>. Some of the other campus religious groups work out of the Religious Activity Commons (RAC) on Locust Walk.</p>
<p>Penn's Religious Studies and Judaic Studies departments are among the finest in the country. Notable professors include <a>John DiIulio</a> of Penn's Political Science Department, the first director of the <a>White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives</a>. The CHORDS initiative, led jointly by the Associate Chaplain and a student board, organize service efforts with faith-based groups in the West Philadelphia community.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Penn's <a>sports</a> teams are nicknamed the <a>Quakers</a>. They participate in the <a>Ivy League</a> and <a>Division I</a> (Division I FCS for football) in the <a>NCAA</a>. In recent decades they often have been <a>league</a> champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was its <a>cricket</a> team.&lt;ref&gt;Kieran, John (1932), &quot;Sports of the Times,&quot; The <a>New York Times</a>, October 8, 1932, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Rowing</h3>
<p> Rowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the <a>University Barge Club</a>. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight mens teams and an openweight women's team, all of which compete as part of the <a>Eastern Sprints</a> League.  In addition to several world class and legendary crews through the years, Penn Rowing has both enjoyed and produced a long list of world famous coaches and olympians, including <a>John B. Kelly, Jr.</a>, <a>Joe Burk</a>, Rusty Callow, <a>Harry Parker</a>, and <a>Ted Nash</a>. The teams row out of <a>College Boat Club</a>, #11 <a>Boathouse Row</a>. The program is currently under the direction of mens head coach Greg Myhr.</p>
<h3>Rugby</h3>
<p> The Penn Men's Rugby Football Club is recognized as the one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in America. The earliest documentation of its existence comes from the <em>Daily Pennsylvanian</em>, October 22, 1910: &quot;Penn's Rugby Team Students Practice on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock am&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, '11, dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail&#x2026;&quot; - <em>Daily Pennsylvanian</em>, 22 October 1910</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team existed on and off during the World Wars, with the current club having it roots in the 1960s. While the current team no longer rises so early in the morning for practice, the tradition of hard work and enthusiasm developed by CC Walton lives on.</p>
<p>The club continues to strive for the highest level of play, while also enjoying the camaraderie and social aspects of the game. In 1992, Penn won the Ivy League Championship, defeating Dartmouth in the final.&lt;ref&gt;www.ivyrugby.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Penn Men's Rugby won the <a>Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union</a> championship.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Penn first fielded a <a>football</a> team against <a>Princeton</a> at the <a>Germantown Cricket Club</a> in <a>Philadelphia</a> on November 11, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Rottenberg, Dan</a> (1985) &quot;Fight On, Pennsylvania&quot; Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|350px|right|Franklin Field</a> Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus <a>George Washington Woodruff</a> introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the <a>forward pass</a>, as well as the <a>place-kick</a> from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897, and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Rottenberg, Dan</a> (1985) &quot;Fight On, Pennsylvania&quot; Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 28, 33&#x2013;34.&lt;/ref&gt; The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era&#x2014;<a>John Heisman</a> and <a>John Outland</a>&#x2014;are remembered each year with the presentation of the <a>Heisman Trophy</a> to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the <a>Outland Trophy</a> to the most outstanding college football <a>interior lineman</a> of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, each year the <a>Bednarik Award</a> is given to college football's best defensive player. <a>Chuck Bednarik</a> (Class of 1949) was a three-time <a>All-America</a>n <a>center</a>/<a>linebacker</a> who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the '47 squad boasted four-time All-American <a>tackle</a> <a>George Savitsky</a> and three-time All-American <a>halfback</a> <a>Skip Minisi</a>. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the <a>College Football Hall of Fame</a>, as was their coach, <a>George Munger</a> (a star running back at Penn in the early '30s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the <a>Philadelphia Eagles</a>, becoming the <a>NFL's</a> last 60-minute man. He was elected to the <a>Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, <a>Harold Stassen</a> attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time <a>college football</a>, but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.</p>
<p><a>ESPN</a>'s <em><a>College GameDay</a></em> traveled to Penn to highlight the <a>Harvard</a>-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.</p>

<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p> Penn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) <a>Final Four</a> appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to <a>Magic Johnson</a>-led <a>Michigan State</a> in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the <a>Philadelphia Big 5</a>, along with <a>La Salle</a>, <a>Saint Joseph's</a>, <a>Temple</a>, and <a>Villanova</a>. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> to <a>Texas A&amp;M</a>.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p><a>Franklin Field</a> is where the Quakers play football, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, sprint football, and <a>track and field</a> (and formerly soccer). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the <a>Philadelphia Eagles</a>, and was the site of early <a>Army &#x2013; Navy</a> games. Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as <a>intramural</a> and club sports, including <a>touch football</a> and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event &quot;the <a>Penn Relays</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Penn's home court, the <a>Palestra</a>, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, <a>volleyball</a> teams, <a>wrestling</a> team, and <a>Philadelphia Big Five basketball</a>, as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn baseball plays its home games at <a>Meiklejohn Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Olympic Boycott Games</a> of 1980 were held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to <a>Moscow</a>'s hosting of the <a>1980 Summer Olympics</a> following the <a>Soviet incursion in Afghanistan</a>. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p>The university has come under fire several times in recent years for free speech issues, such as in the <a>water buffalo incident</a> of 1993, when a student was charged for violating Penn's racial harassment policy. In spite of this, Penn is one of only two Ivy League universities (the other being <a>Dartmouth College</a>) to receive the highest possible free speech rating from the watchdog group <a>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a>, founded by noted Penn professor and civil libertarian <a>Alan Charles Kors</a>. Penn also maintains the Student Committee on Open Expression, which monitors and deliberates over issues of free speech between campus groups.</p>
