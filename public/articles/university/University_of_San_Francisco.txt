<p>The <strong>University of San Francisco</strong> (<strong>USF</strong>), is a private, <a>Jesuit university</a> located in <a>San Francisco, California</a>. Founded in 1855, USF was established as the first university in San Francisco. It is the second oldest institution for higher learning in California and the tenth-oldest university of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>. USF is the eighth largest <a>Jesuit university</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>USF's main campus is located on a  setting between the <a>Golden Gate Bridge</a> and <a>Golden Gate Park</a>. USF's <a>nickname</a> is &quot;The Hilltop,&quot; appropriately named since the campus is located at the peak of one of San Francisco's major hills. USF's close historical ties with the City and County of San Francisco are reflected in the University's <a>motto</a>, <em>Pro Urbe et Universitate</em> (For the City and University).</p>
<p>USF's Jesuit-Catholic identity is rooted in the symbolic vision of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order. Jesuits are characterized by a dedication to both &quot;the life of the mind and the encounter with the world,&quot; a mission distinguished by their intellectual and humanitarian activities &#x2014; notably in the fields of higher education, human rights, and social justice.</p>
<p>USF's inclusive founding mission attracts students and faculty from diverse religious traditions and a broad range of convictions. However, the Jesuit call to justice is evident in work across religious boundaries in community service, reflection retreats, and immersion programs both on campus and abroad.</p>
<p>USF's 8,772-member student body is composed of students from seventy-five countries, all fifty states (including <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, <a>Puerto Rico</a> and <a>Guam</a>), and is ranked in the top 15 national universities for student diversity and international student enrollment. The University is known for its public service efforts (McCarthy Center), its world-renowned Center for the Pacific Rim (Asian and American Studies) and its nationally recognized graduate programs in the fields of law, education, business, nursing, and environmental management.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Founded in 1855 as <a>Saint Ignatius</a> Academy by the <a>Italian</a> Jesuits Rev. <a>Anthony Maraschi</a>, Rev. Joseph Bixio, and Rev. Michael Accolti, USF started in a building along <a>Market Street</a> in what later became downtown San Francisco. St. Ignatius Academy received its charter on April 30, 1859 from the <a>State of California</a> signed by governor <a>John B. Weller</a> (the document survived the 1906 fire and earthquake) and changed its name to St. Ignatius College. The original curriculum included <a>Greek</a>, <a>Spanish</a>, <a>Latin</a>, English, <a>French</a>, <a>Italian</a>, <a>algebra</a>, arithmetic, <a>history</a>, <a>geography</a>, <a>elocution</a>, and <a>bookkeeping</a>. Father Maraschi, was not only the college's first president, but also a professor, the college's treasurer, and first <a>pastor</a> of Saint Ignatius Church.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Saint Ignatius Church, east side view.</a></p>
<p>A new building was constructed in 1862 to replace the first frame building. In June 1863, the university awarded its first <a>bachelor of arts</a> degree.</p>
<p>In 1880, the college moved from Market Street to a new site on the corner of Hayes Street and <a>Van Ness Avenue</a> (currently occupied by the <a>Davies Symphony Hall</a>).  The third St. Ignatius College received little to moderate damage in the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>, but was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire.  The campus moved west, to the corner of Hayes and Shrader Streets, close to <a>Golden Gate Park</a>, where it occupied a hastily constructed structure known as The Shirt Factory (for its resemblance to similar manufacturing buildings of the era) for the next 20+ years. The college moved to its present site on the south slope of <a>Lone Mountain</a> in 1927. The college was built on the site of the former <a>Odd Fellows</a>, Mount Olivet and <a>Masonic</a> Cemeteries. In 1913, the city enacted a law prohibiting more burials in the City and County of San Francisco. The remains were transferred to <a>Colma</a>, California</p>
<p>To celebrate its <a>diamond jubilee</a> in 1930, St. Ignatius College changed its name to the University of San Francisco. According to USF history professor Father John B. Mc Gloin, S.J., the change from college to university was sought by long-time <a>San Francisco Mayor</a> <a>James Rolph Jr.</a>. at the time, running for <a>Governor of California</a>.</p>
<p>A male-only school for most of its history, USF became fully <a>coeducational</a> in 1964. In 1969, the <a>high school</a> division, already wholly separate from the university, moved to the western part of San Francisco and became <a>St. Ignatius College Preparatory</a>.  In 1978, the university acquired <a>Lone Mountain College</a>   Today USF is organized into five academic divisions with 8,772 students and 506 faculty members.</p>
<p>In the name of <a>academic freedom</a> the <a>Jesuit</a> university invites speakers who espouse views at odds with Catholic doctrine. Conservative Catholics sometimes criticize this practice. In 2004, Bishop <a>Allen Henry Vigneron</a> of the <a>Diocese of Oakland</a> forbade the <em>Catholic Voice</em> newspaper to print an advertisement for a seminar called &quot;Imaging the Future Church,&quot; sponsored by a group of Catholic lay people who have called for church reforms. Also in 2004, the <a>Cardinal Newman Society</a> protested the university's selection of Mayor <a>Gavin Newsom</a> as speaker for the business school's annual commencement ceremony, for his views on <a>abortion</a> and <a>gay-rights</a>.</p>
<p>October 2005 marked the 150th anniversary of the university's founding.</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p> Fueled by memories of the 1970s Energy Crisis, the University of San Francisco has made an effort to encourage an environmentally conscious student body as well as making changes towards a more sustainable campus. Throughout the university&#x2019;s campus, students and faculty are involved in multiple clubs and organizations that are dedicated to minimizing the campus&#x2019;s environmental impact including The Green Team, Back to da Roots, Envision, The Garden Project and Trust the Tap. These groups have brought several changes to the campus including the consumption of fair trade coffee, the creation of organic gardens, composting and the encouragement of re-usable containers for tap water.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2007, the Garden Project (a Living Learning Community) was formed based around the creating and maintaining of the Campus&#x2019; first Organic Garden. Initially headed by Media Studies Professor, Filmmaker, and Organic Gardner Melinda Stone and Architecture Professor Seth Watchel, the Garden houses fruits, vegetables, and herbs with the help and continuous care provided by students and community members, alike.</p>
<p>In 2005, USF installed approximately  of solar panels to the top of Gleeson Library.  In addition to energy-saving windows, high-efficiency lighting, energy efficient skylights, and insulated outer walls,  the University has spent $375,000 on solar panels for the recently renovated Kalmanovitz Hall. Combined with Cowell Hall, Gleeson Library, Koret Health and Recreation Center, and the University Center, the added solar panels to Kalmanovitz Hall has boosted USF&#x2019;s energy production from 71 kilowatt hours to nearly 420 kilowatt hours. USF&#x2019;s carbon footprint has subsequently been reduced by 330 tons a year, says Everette Ersery, the assistant director of facilities. Ersery was quoted in the USF Magazine saying &#x201c;it has significantly reduced our carbon footprint and electrical bill, while reducing the amount of energy we and PG&amp;E use.&#x201d; The solar panels produce 16 percent of the lower campus&#x2019;s energy needs.  The assistant vice president of facilities management said that solar heated rooftop water pipes heat 50 percent of the water used in residence halls. The University has also established a composting program that began in September 2008. The new program composts food waste from the kitchen and cafeteria. Through the composting program the University of San Francisco has managed to prevent about 36 tons of material per month from being thrown out.</p>

<h2>Student body</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of San Francisco enrolled 5,278 undergraduates, 2,518 graduate students, and 738 law students in Fall 2007.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, USF's diversity (then St. Ignatius College) was mostly a reflection of the diversity inherent in <a>San Francisco</a>. For example, when <a>German</a> and <a>French</a> migrants came to San Francisco, the population of European students in USF increased as well.  USF's student population diversity has increased throughout the last century. <a>Filipinos</a> started attending the university in the 1920s, after the United State's annexation of <a>Philippines</a>. In 1960s, <a>Mexicans</a>, <a>African Americans</a>, <a>Chinese</a> , <a>Norwegians</a> came to USF. The 1970s marked the start of students from <a>Hong Kong</a>, <a>Japan</a> and <a>Indonesia</a>, coming to USF.  In 1964, 473 women enrolled as full-time undergraduates marking the first time women attended USF.</p>
<p>A school census of Fall 1993 undergraduate freshmen indicated 42.66% <a>Whites</a>, 23% <a>Asian Americans</a>, 11% International students, 10% <a>Hispanic</a>/<a>Latinos</a>. 5% <a>African Americans</a>, 0.34% <a>Native Americans</a> and 8% of students in the census chose not to specify. Enrollment in Fall 1993 was a total of 7,662 students, 62.5% of whom were undergraduates. In 2002, a plan was developed by the university to increase the diversity of the USF student population.  This plan was enacted by university officials, who also enlisted the help of USF alumni to &quot;assemble a mix of students that will help USF achieve its vision: to educate leaders who will fashion a more humane and just world.&quot; In 2002, 64.4% of undergraduates were female and 35.6% were male. The plan sought to address concerns of the gender ratio and increase the percentage of international students at USF from 9.4% to around 15%. A statement made by USF President, <a>Stephen A. Privett</a>, S.J. (2000 to present) in an interview by <em>USF Magazine</em> highlighted the importance the university placed on the diversity of its student population. The USF President also clarified the scope of diversity to include &quot;ethnicity, gender and life experiences.&quot; In December 2006, USF was awarded a $500,000 grant by the Lumina Foundation for Education to examine &quot;how best to recruit and retain low-income, first-generation, and ethnic minority students at <a>Jesuit universities</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Surveys show that USF students consistently value diversity at USF. A survey conducted for graduating students on 24 May 2007 by USF's Office of Student Enrichment Programs indicated that 86% felt that individual ethnicity, religion, race and other differences were valued at USF. The same survey records that 70% of the graduating students agreed that their appreciation of those differences increased while they were at USF.  The result was consistent with past surveys conducted on graduating students, where over the period from May 1997 to December 1999, the result ranged from 78% to 84% for students valued the mentioned differences and 63% to 72% for those who &quot;felt their appreciation of differences increased while at USF.&quot; In 2004, a survey by <a>UCLA</a>'s <a>Higher Education Research Institute</a> indicated that 80% of USF students &quot;considered it essential or very important that their undergraduate experience&quot; developed their personal values. This statistic was higher than the national average sampling of 67%. and enrolls over 700 international students from over 70 countries, including: Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, France, Norway, Austria, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, among others.  USF also hosts <a>J-1</a> exchange and Intensive English Program student participants.</p>
<p>The University of San Francisco attracted 783 international students (9.0% of the student body) in 2007. and a variety of internationally-oriented student groups like the International Student Association, Global Living Community, an International Advisory Council, and an International Network Program. USF sponsors an annual International Education Week with an international fair featuring <a>consulate</a>s in the San Francisco area, storytelling opportunities, educational speakers, and a performance event called Culturescape.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p> According to <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, USF is classified as a more selective university. &quot;</p>
<p>In Fall 2008, 67% of freshman undergraduates who applied were admitted. USF enrolled 4,869 undergraduate students.</li>
  <li>The most popular majors and the percentage of undergrads in each major are: business/marketing 29%, communication/journalism 7%, computer/info sciences 6%, health sciences 8%, psychology 8%, social sciences 14%, visual/performing arts 6%.</li>
  <li>Other schools with the greatest overlap of applicants are San Francisco State University, Santa Clara University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Cruz.</li>
  <li>In an average class 1% graduate in three years or less, 45% graduate in four years or less, 62% graduate in five years or less, 65% graduate in 6 years or less.</li>
  <li>In September 2005 USF admitted 161 students from <a>Loyola University New Orleans</a>, <a>Xavier University of Louisiana</a>, <a>Tulane University</a>, <a>Dillard University</a>, <a>University of New Orleans</a>, and <a>University of Southern Mississippi</a> who were displaced by <a>Hurricane Katrina</a>, housing &quot;approximately 90 on campus.&quot; The students came from universities that were closed as a result of the massive city flooding after Hurricane Katrina. In an email addressed to the USF community, USF President <a>Stephen A. Privett, S.J</a> wrote, &quot;Our policy is to accept as many qualified students as we can accommodate and work out the details later when we and they have more information. &quot; Some of the Hurricane Katrina victims also received scholarships. One such recipient was Stace McRaney, whose home and workplace was destroyed by the hurricane. Stace McRaney was the first recipient of the Lone Mountain Legacy Scholarship, funded by alumnae of the <a>San Francisco College for Women</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financial aid</h3>
<p>For the 2006-2007 academic year, 66.0% of USF's undergraduates received some form of financial aid, 52.6% received institutional aid/grants, and 21.0% received federal <a>Pell Grant</a> support. For the same year, 64.2% of graduate students received some for of financial aid.  However, in a USF student guide published by <a>The College Prowler</a> in 2006 , USF students rated high tuition fees as one of &quot;the ten worst things about USF.&quot;</p>
<h2>Campus dining</h2>
<p>USF's dining options span multiple locations around the campus:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Market Caf&#x00e9;</strong> - The Market Caf&#x00e9;, the main campus' cafeteria, is located on the second floor of the University Center.</li>
  <li><strong>Crossroads Caf&#x00e9;</strong> - Crossroads Caf&#x00e9; is a student-run dining facility, located on the first floor of the University Center building.  The caf&#x00e9; originally started as a commuter students' lounge in the basement of the former Campion Hall, now Kalmanovitz Hall, in 1931.  The lounge was moved to the University Center Building when it was constructed in the Fall of 1966.  At the time, it was called the Green and Gold Room.  Today, Crossroads is a popular spot for dining and socializing.  It also hosts live entertainment events, such as open mike nights, games, performances, and crafts.  Office hours are often held in Crossroads, where students can consult and get advice from their teachers.</li>
  <li><strong>Outtakes Caf&#x00e9;</strong> - The Outtakes Caf&#x00e9;, also known as the Wolf and Kettle, is located on USF's Lone Mountain campus. Outtakes has two sections: a dining center, similar to a smaller cafeteria structure of tables, booths and chairs, and a &#x201c;small retail convenience store, offering a wide variety of grocery items, fresh food and produce, and all the essentials.&quot;</li>
  <li><strong>Club Ed Caf&#x00e9;</strong> - The Club Ed Caf&#x00e9; is located on the bottom floor of USF's School of Education building.</li>
  <li><strong>Outtahere</strong> - The newest addition to the campus' dining facilities, replacing Jamba Juice. Similar to Outtakes, it provides a small dining area that serves breakfast all day and a small convenience store that sells primarily organic foods. This facility is open until 2 A.M. to students of USF.</li>

<p><a>right|thumb|San Francisco Dons logo</a> </p>
<p>USF competes in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> and is a charter member of the <a>West Coast Conference</a>, along with local rivals <a>Santa Clara University</a> and <a>Saint Mary's College of California</a>. Sports offered are men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>track and field</a>, as well as men&#x2019;s <a>baseball</a> and women's <a>volleyball</a>.  USF has won 12 NCAA championships, 1 NIT championships, and 42 WCC championships. USF&#x2019;s mascot is the <a>Don</a> and its colors are <a>green</a> and <a>gold</a>.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Athletics at USF dates back to its founding in 1855, when founder <a>Anthony Maraschi</a>, S.J. organized ball games as recreation for the first students. However, intercollegiate competition only dates back to 1907, when then-St. Ignatius College began playing organized <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, and <a>rugby</a> against other local colleges and high schools. Rivalries with neighboring <a>Santa Clara University</a> and <a>Saint Mary's College of California</a> have their origins in this early period.</p>
<h3>1951 USF Dons Football Team</h3>
<p>The 1951 University of San Francisco Dons football team went undefeated, with a record of 9-0, and the team produced ten future NFL players (<a>Ollie Matson</a>, <a>Gino Marchetti</a>, <a>Bob St. Clair</a>, <a>Dick Stanfel</a>, <a>Ed Brown</a>, <a>Lou Stephens</a>, <a>Burl Toler</a>, <a>Joe Scudero</a>, <a>Roy Barni</a>, <a>Mike Mergen</a>, <a>Merrill Peacock</a>, and <a>Ralph Thomas</a>). Five became NFL Pro-Bowlers, and <a>Gino Marchetti</a>, <a>Ollie Matson</a>, and <a>Bob St. Clair</a> later were inducted into the <a>NFL Hall of Fame</a>&#x2014;a record for one college team. The team also had another first; Burl Toler became the first African American official in the NFL. Even the future NFL Commissioner, Pete Rozelle, played a role as the Dons' Athletic Publicist. At the height of their success, the team experienced one of the greatest snubs in college football history. Due to the team having two African-American star players, Ollie Matson and Burl Toler, they were not invited to play in any of the college football bowl games hosted by the SEC (<a>Southern Conference</a>). This  resulted in the team being invited to the <a>Orange Bowl</a> without Toler and Matson. Outraged, the team refused the invitation saying, &#x201c; &#x2018;No, we&#x2019;re not going to leave &#x2018;em at home,&#x2019; said guard Dick Columbini. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going to play with &#x2018;em or we&#x2019;re not going to play&#x2019;&#x201d;. Walters is an <a>NBA</a> veteran, originally the 16th overall pick by the <a>New Jersey Nets</a> in the <a>1993 NBA Draft</a>.</p>
