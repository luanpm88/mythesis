<h2>Campus lore</h2>
<p><a>right|210px|thumb|T.J. Farr Building</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Dammit the Dog&quot;: a former university president once said &quot;dammit&quot; to a dog in front of a crowd.  He covered by saying that was the dog's name.  The dog has his own tombstone, an operable fire hydrant, on TTU campus opposite Derryberry Hall.</li>
  <li>T.J. Farr Building is one of the few buildings on campus not called &quot;Hall.&quot;  It is said this is because when you say &quot;Farr Hall&quot; in the <a>South</a>, people think you're referring to something other than an academic building, namely a <em><a>Fire Hall</a></em>.</li>
  <li>The golden eagle atop Derryberry Hall was stolen by students from a hotel in <a>Monteagle, Tennessee</a>. After being retrieved by the owner of the hotel many different times, the hotel owner later donated the statue to the university.  The governor officially pardoned the students involved.</li>
  <li>The &quot;Blizzard&quot; is a tradition which started in 1984 when students celebrated the first successful shot made by Tennessee Tech in a basketball game against <a>MTSU</a> by throwing showers of &quot;Tech Squares&quot; (toilet paper) into the air. Since MTSU moved to the Sun Belt Conference, the Blizzard is now performed against <a>Austin Peay State University</a>.</li>

<h2>The Tennessee Tech Hymn</h2>
<p>The quiet hills stand steadfast 'round walls of russet brown.&lt;/br&gt; On halls serene and campus green the smoky hills look down&lt;/br&gt; And steadfast may I cherish what thou hast giv'n to me.&lt;/br&gt; Oh Alma Mater Tennessee Tech, God prosper thee.</p>
<p>Deep purple stand the mountains and golden sets the sun.&lt;/br&gt; We proudly wear these colors fair until our goal is won&lt;/br&gt; We pledge thee faithful service, our love and loyalty.&lt;/br&gt; Oh Alma Mater Tennessee Tech, God prosper thee.</p>
<p>Words and music by Joan Derryberry. </p>
