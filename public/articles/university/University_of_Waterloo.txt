<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> is a comprehensive <a>public university</a> in the city of <a>Waterloo</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>. The school was founded in 1957 by Drs. <a>Gerry Hagey</a> and <a>Ira G. Needles</a>, and has since grown to an institution of more than 30,000 students, faculty, and staff. The school is notable for being the first university in North America to create a <a>Faculty of Mathematics</a>, and for having the largest <a>co-operative education program</a> in the world.</p>
<p>Maclean's <em>Reputational University Rankings</em> for Canadian universities has consistently ranked UW first in the &quot;Most Innovative&quot; and &quot;Leaders of Tomorrow&quot; sections, and second in the &quot;Highest Quality&quot; section. The school is also known for having more company spin-offs than any other Canadian university. As of Fall 2009, there were 24,891 <a>undergraduate</a> and 3,497 <a>graduate students</a>, with 1,030 <a>full-time</a> <a>faculty</a> members and 2,190 staff. The school has approximately 140,000 alumni in 141 countries. The university's newspapers include <a>Imprint</a> (The Official Student Newspaper), <a>The Iron Warrior</a> (Engineering), and mathNEWS (Math).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Waterloo (also known as &quot;uWaterloo&quot;) was originally <a>conceived</a> in 1955 as the Waterloo College Associate Faculties (WCAF), a semi-autonomous entity within Waterloo College (now <a>Wilfrid Laurier University</a>, formerly known as Waterloo Lutheran University). The non-denominational school was founded in 1957 by Dr. Gerry Hagey and Ira G. Needles in Waterloo, Ontario. The Waterloo College of Arts became affiliated with <a>the University of Western Ontario</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>A plaque was erected just inside the entrance to the university on University Avenue West across from Seagram Drive, Waterloo: </p>
<p>Today <a>Wilfrid Laurier University</a> is reputed for its business and liberal arts programs while the University of Waterloo is reputed for its engineering and math programs. The university's first president, <a>Gerry Hagey</a>, gathered teachers of engineering and basic sciences, and also obtained an initial grant of $625,000 from the government. The first 74 students began classes on July 1, 1957, in makeshift temporary buildings on the Waterloo College campus. In 1958, the University of Waterloo established an extension department.</p>
<p>[[File:DSC01967 Iron Ring Cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Ring]] received by Engineering students at the University of Waterloo]]</p>
<p>In January 1958, Hagey and colleagues purchased 74&nbsp;hectares (184&nbsp;acres) of farmland a kilometre west of Waterloo College's main campus in order to meet the growing expansion needs. Soon, construction began of the first academic building on the new site, known as the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Building, later renamed Engineering 1 and now named after <a>Douglas Wright</a>, UW's first Dean of Engineering. Through a series of delicate negotiations which turned into bitter hostilities, the &quot;Faculty of Science and Engineering&quot; broke free from Waterloo College, partly due to the fact that the two campuses were now disjoint. Hagey himself was opposed to the break, as his dream had been to establish a world-class university built on the strengths of Waterloo College's liberal arts strengths and the applied science education of WCAF.</p>
<p>The University of Waterloo in <a>Waterloo</a>, <a>Ontario</a> was incorporated and granted a university charter in 1959. In early 1959, the government established three universities: Waterloo Lutheran University, <a>University of St. Jerome's College</a>, and the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. UW then quickly created a <a>faculty of arts</a> in order to gain respect as a university. In the same year, arts students joined the science and engineering students in the new campus.</p>
<p>Three more church colleges ended up joining the university.  These carried the name of &quot;College&quot; for many years, but this was later changed to the somewhat cumbersome &quot;University College&quot; designation in order to reflect the degree-granting nature of these affiliated institutions.  These colleges are: <a>Renison</a>, <a>Conrad Grebel</a>, and <a>St. Paul's</a>. Waterloo created the first Faculty of <a>Mathematics</a> in North America, and the first co-op programs outside of engineering soon followed. The co-op system then was revised in involving four-month terms rather than the initial three-month terms. In 1967, the College of <a>Optometry</a> of Ontario, at the time an independent institution in Toronto, moved to Waterloo and became affiliated with the university as the <a>School of Optometry</a>. In 1967 the world's first Department of Kinesiology was created, which later grew into the Faculty of Applied <a>Health Sciences</a>. The Faculty of <a>Environmental Studies</a> was created soon after.  It was renamed the Faculty of Environment in 2008.</p>
<p>The University of Waterloo launched its program in architecture in 1967. More recently, in 2004, the <a>School of Architecture</a> was relocated to downtown <a>Cambridge</a> in an effort to enhance the school's facilities and strengthen its community ties. The School, located in a former industrial building on the <a>Grand River</a>, is an important part of plans to bolster the economy of Cambridge's downtown area.  Additionally, Architecture is now part of the Faculty of Engineering.  It formerly fell under Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>In 2001, the University of Waterloo announced its intentions to develop a Research and Technology Park on the university's north campus. The RT Park intends to house many of the high-tech industries in the area and maintain the partnership between university and <a>private-sector</a> innovation. <a>Sybase</a>/iAnywhere Solutions and <a>Open Text Corporation</a> were the first two tenants, and the multi-tenant Accelerator Centre building opened in April 2006.  <a>Google</a> has since established an office in the RT Park. The RT Park continues to grow with 2- and 3- storey multi-tenant buildings, again surrounded by ample parking lots.  Earlier suggestions to include medium- and high-density residential facilities, with the hope of enabling employees in the RT Park to have the option of not having to commute to suburban detached houses, have so far not come to fruition. In 2010, it was announced that the RT Park would bear the name of David Johnston, who will depart Waterloo on October 1, 2010 to become Governor General of Canada.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:WaterlooMathBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|350|The [[brutalism|brutalist]]  Math and Computer Science building, as seen from what was then the B2 Green.]] <a>thumb||350px|left|The Student Life Centre courtyard.</a> The main campus is located along University Avenue in <a>Waterloo</a>, <a>Ontario</a> on what was, until the 1960s, farmland. Since its creation, a considerable level of commercial and <a>residential development</a> has built up around the Waterloo campus, notably with many offices of high-tech firms.  This has resulted in a major urban expansion into the surrounding rural areas, with a consequent loss of prime farmland and degradation of natural areas.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|350|The Dana Porter Arts Library, with sculptures by Ron Baird in the foreground</a> Over a period of five years (2003&#x2013;2008), the University experienced its second largest building boom since the 1960s.  New buildings completed include the Tatham Building (Co-op Education), the Environmental and Information Technologies Building (chiefly Earth Sciences and Electrical Engineering), expansions to Burt Matthews Hall (Applied Health Sciences) and J.G. Hagey Hall, a building for the School of Architecture, a new Solar Technologies Building, a major addition to the School of Optometry Building, and sundry additions to several Engineering buildings.  Currently (2010) under construction are the Quantum Nanotechnology Building, the Engineering 5 Building, the Engineering 6 Building, the Math 3 building, and the Environment 3 building.</p>
<p>To commemorate individuals who have made major contributions to the University of Waterloo, some buildings, most notably in the Engineering realm, have been renamed.  Three examples include Engineering 4 becoming Carl Pollock Hall, Engineering Lecture Hall becoming <a>Rod Coutts</a> Hall, and the aforementioned Engineering 1 becoming the Douglas Wright Engineering Building.  Some buildings, such as the Davis Centre (William G. Davis Computer Research Centre), the J.G. Hagey Hall of the Humanities, and Ira G. Needles Hall (Administration) were named after people at their time of inception.</p>
<p>The <a>geographical coordinates</a> of the main UW campus, using the NAD 83 datum, are .</p>
<p>The <a>School of Architecture</a> was relocated to a former mill in <a>Cambridge</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, in 2004.</p>
<p>A new campus for the health sciences program has been built in <a>Kitchener</a>, <a>Ontario</a> and includes a satellite of <a>McMaster University</a>&#x2019;s Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and the School of Pharmacy. The building opened in December 2008. The building has unique elements, such as a colourful curtain wall featuring images of medicinal plants and its use of natural materials such as wood. <img> <a>thumb||800px|center|South entrance to Main Campus.

<p>The <a>University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance</a> offers undergraduate, masters, and doctoral programs. Its Masters of Accounting graduates are well prepared for the UFE exam for <a>Chartered Accountant</a>s. The programs offered at the School of Accounting and Finance are Accounting and Financial Management (Public Accounting and Financial Management streams), Computing and Financial Management, Mathematics/Chartered Accountancy, and Biotechnology/Chartered Accountancy.</p>
<h3>International rankings</h3>
<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the University of Waterloo 145th overall in the world, dropping back 32 places from its position of 113th in the 2009 <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings), wherein it came 27th in the world for technology, 56th in the world for the natural sciences, and 114th in the world in life sciences and biomedicine.</p>
<p>According to the Academic Ranking of World Universities conducted by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, the University of Waterloo was ranked 201-302, 100-136 in North America, and 76-107 in Engineering Technology/Computer Science.</p>
<h3>Globe and Mail Canadian University Report Card</h3>
<p>In the annual Globe and Mail Canadian University Report Card, Waterloo was ranked first or tied for first amongst large universities in three categories. Waterloo received the highest grades for career preparation, quality of education, and academic reputation. Waterloo also ranked third in student satisfaction category and second on course availability/variety.</p>
<h3><em>Maclean's</em> rankings</h3>
<p>Waterloo prides itself on its high performance in <em><a>Maclean's</a></em> magazine's <a>Canadian university rankings</a>. The university routinely places in the top three in the numerical Comprehensive ranking, and in the reputation survey it placed first as best overall 13 out of 15 times that the ranking was published. <em>Maclean's</em> describes the university as &quot;strong in math, engineering and computer science,&quot; as well as being &quot;internationally recognized for the unparalleled success of its more than 100 undergraduate and graduate co-op programs.&quot;</p>
<h3>Co-operative education</h3>
<p>Waterloo is famous for being a groundbreaking proponent of <a>co-operative education</a> in Canada and currently maintains the largest co-op program in the world with over 10,000 co-op students per year.</p>
<h2>Ties with industry</h2>
<p>Through its large co-op program (the largest in the world) and many spin-off companies, the University of Waterloo maintains close ties with the high-tech industry.</p>
<p>UW has a long-standing <a>intellectual property</a> policy that leaves ownership rights with the inventor, rather than the university, which has helped create many spin-off companies that maintain a good relationship with UW. In particular, it has a strong connection with <a>Research In Motion</a>, the makers of the Blackberry, that goes beyond its close physical proximity. Co-founder and CEO <a>Mike Lazaridis</a> was a UW student before he started RIM, and was the <a>chancellor</a> of the university. RIM hires hundreds of UW co-op students each term and a large proportion of its employees are UW alumni.</p>
<p>During his visit to Waterloo in October 2005, <a>Microsoft</a> co-founder <a>Bill Gates</a> stated, &quot;Most years, we hire more students out of Waterloo than any university in the world, typically 50 or even more.&quot;</p>
<h3>Agreement with Microsoft</h3>
<p>[[File:Bill Gates @ the University of Waterloo (61938659).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bill Gates]] at the University of Waterloo]] The university announced a controversial agreement with Microsoft in 2002. As part of this agreement, the University of Waterloo was to receive $2.3 million in funding from the <a>Microsoft</a> Canada Academic Innovation Alliance and would introduce Microsoft's <a>C# programming language</a> in its Electrical and Computer Engineering programs (also known as ECE.) The university came under harsh criticism for this agreement to develop Engineering courses using Microsoft's <a>.NET Framework</a>. The university administration asserted that this agreement would not jeopardize academic integrity at the institution, although the university president acknowledged making mistakes in announcing the deal.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Computer Science</a> was not part of this agreement, and currently offers <a>Scheme</a> and a choice of <a>C</a> or <a>Python</a> in its introductory courses.</p>
<h3>Spin-offs</h3>
<p>Several companies have roots in, or have been spun off from the university. (The large number of spin-offs from UW is in part due to the University's long-standing policy of allowing creators to retain all the rights to their inventions.) Some of the most notable spin-offs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Certicom</a> (acquired by Research In Motion) - founded by two Waterloo professors, <a>Scott Vanstone</a> and <a>Gordon Agnew</a></li>

<p>The Faculty of Engineering is in the midst of a $150 million expansion between 2008 and 2012 in the form of three new Engineering buildings. Engineering 5 which opened in October 2010 houses a Student Design Centre that showcases the Waterloo Engineering student teams. Engineering 5 will also be the new home for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, and the Department of Systems Design Engineering. Engineering 6 for the Department of Chemical Engineering is in progress and will open Fall 2011.</p>
<p>Other new buildings include Mathematics 3 and Environment 3, scheduled for completion at March 2011.</p>
<p>The university and the <a>City of Kitchener</a> are constructing a health sciences campus, including a <a>School of Pharmacy</a>, in the central Kitchener <a>warehouse district</a>. The project will cost $34 million for the first phase. The Honours co-operative Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy program began in January 2008. Preliminary operations, including staffed medical and optometry clinics, are based out of the former Victoria Public School in Kitchener's downtown.</p>
<p>The Kitchener site will also host a <a>satellite campus</a> of <a>McMaster University</a>'s <a>medical school</a>, bringing 28 first-year medical students to Waterloo Region each year to study. They will remain until the end of the three-year McMaster program, and have the option of continuing as a resident in the area.</p>
<p>On October 16, 2006, President Johnston announced that the university has entered discussions with the City of Stratford and the <a>Stratford Festival of Canada</a> exploring the possibility of establishing a satellite campus in Stratford. On the same day, Stratford City Council unanimously endorsed a <a>memorandum of understanding</a> to continue exploration of the issue. This was clarified further on March 26, 2008, following a funding commitment in the previous day's provincial budget; the campus is to specialize in digital media and global business, and also has a funding commitment from <a>Open Text</a> corp. The <a>University of Waterloo Stratford Campus</a> together with the Canadian Digital Media Network hosted <a>Canada 3.0</a>, a digital media forum in Stratford that attracted 1,500 attendees. In February, 2010 the campus opened its doors at 6 Wellington St., Stratford.</p>
<p>With donations by alumni and matching contributions from government, the university announced in April 2004 the founding of the <a>Institute for Quantum Computing</a>.</p>
<p>Construction began in September 2008 for the Quantum-Nano Centre, a massive building which will house the <a>Institute for Quantum Computing</a> as well as the new <a>Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology</a>.  The building will be located in the centre of campus and its cost will exceed $100M. It is planned to be opened in September 2010.</p>
<p>Though in preliminary discussion there also has been talks for the initiation of a law program.</p>
<p>The university is planning for its sixth decade (2007&#x2013;2017) with an &quot;ambitious plan&quot;. According to the plan's documentation, some objectives are benchmarked by the following targets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By 2017, at least 12 UW academic programs will be the best in North America</li>
  <li>By 2017, at least 12 out of 44 departments/schools will be ranked top 12 in North America</li>
  <li>By 2017, at least 20 UW departments/schools will be ranked top three in Canada</li>
  <li>Each department/school will participate in a <a>doctoral program</a></li>
  <li>All departments/schools will be ranked top 25% in Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>UW has opened, in partnership with the Higher Colleges of Technology, a satellite campus in <a>Dubai</a>; the UAE Dubai Men's College campus. During earlier media releases of the Dubai plans, the campus had come under scrutiny for its perceived lack of transparency in the planning stages, as well as issues regarding the labour used, as well as <a>UAE</a> laws restricting the conventional Canadian freedoms of female and homosexual members of staff. In particular, debate has come up in both the student Senate, the university's Board of Governors over possible violations of Policy 33, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<h3>Logo controversy</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The old logo (left) versus proposed new logo (right)</a></p>
<p>In late July 2009, news of a possible remodeling of the university logo surfaced. With a <a>Facebook</a> group reporting over 4000 members just three days after its creation and an article released in the <em><a>National Post</a></em>, the new logo has gathered somewhat large student and media attention. After considering the feedback, Waterloo's new visual identity will not entirely incorporate a new logo. Instead, the wordmark will be used on marketing materials, and the traditional seal used where a link to tradition is required.</p>
<h2>Mascots</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250|right|King Warrior, the athletics mascot</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>The University's athletics mascot is a lion named King Warrior. The Warriors are the University's <a>sports team</a> and King Warrior's initials, K-W, reflect a common nickname for the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the undergraduate students' Mathematics Society (MathSoc) is the Natural Log (see <a>natural log</a>), which is a wooden log about 60&nbsp;cm (two ft) long, often mistaken as the Faculty's mascot.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Faculty of Mathematics is a 12.2&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) long and 3.4&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft) wide pink tie, often mistaken as MathSoc's mascot.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Engineering Society is a 60&quot; (1.5&nbsp;m) <a>pipe wrench</a> called The TOOL, in 1968. This mascot was stolen by University of Toronto Engineering students in 1982 and returned encased in a 45 gallon drum of concrete. Engineering students worked tirelessly for 6 hours using sledgehammers to free it.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Faculty of Arts is a statue of a boar which was donated to the University of Waterloo Math Faculty in 1978, and in turn donated to the Arts Faculty. It is one of several copies of Italian sculptor Pietro Tacca's (1577&#x2013;1640) &quot;Il <a>Porcellino</a>&quot; statue. Some students claim that rubbing the Boar's nose brings luck.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Faculty of Environment Orientation Week is The Big Banana.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences is a Kangaroo.</li>
  <li>The mascot for the Science Society (SciSoc) is Arriba the Amoeba, a giant human-sized amoeba dressed in a <a>lab coat</a>.</li>
  <li>There is also a pair of 14&nbsp;ft goggles which the Faculty of Science will be introducing for orientation week 2009, and potentially there will be an ongoing theme of goggles as science's mascot. Long term storage for the massive goggles has not yet been decided.</li>
  <li>Arts Students also find solidarity through a recognizable pair of sunglasses that all first-year students to the Faculty receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are: University of Waterloo Seagrams! Seagrams! Vat 69. Warriors, Warriors, Hold that Line! and 'The Black and White and Gold,' with words by K.D. Fryer and H.F. Davis and music by <a>Alfred Kunz</a>.</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>The <a>coat of arms</a> of the University of Waterloo was granted in 1987. The shield's <a>blazon</a> is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Or, on a chevron Sable between three lions rampant Gules a chevronel Argent.</em></p>
<p>The full blazon of the arms (rarely used) continues:</p>
<p><em>Above the Shield is placed a Helm suitable to an Incorporation (a Salade proper lined Gules) with a Mantling Sable doubled Or, and on a Wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest between two maple branches in saltire a trillium displayed and leaved all Proper, and in an Escrol over the same this Motto &quot;CONCORDIA CUM VERITATE&quot;.</em></p>
<p>Representing Waterloo's location in the <a>twin cities</a> of <a>Kitchener-Waterloo</a>, the double-chevron is taken from the coat of arms of <a>Earl Kitchener</a>, and the red lions are taken from the symbol of <a>Arthur, Duke of Wellington</a>, the victor at <a>the Battle of Waterloo</a>.</p>
