<p> The <strong>Stanford Graduate School of Business</strong> (also known as <strong>Stanford Business School</strong>, <strong>Stanford GSB</strong>, or <strong>The GSB</strong>) is one of the professional schools of <a>Stanford University</a>, in <a>Stanford</a>, <a>California</a>. </p>
<p>The Stanford GSB offers a general management <a>MBA</a> degree and thus does not offer degrees in specialized areas such as finance, marketing, human resources etc, although it does offer certificate programs in public management and global management.  The school also offers the <a>Sloan Master's Program</a>, a full-time ten-month <a>MS</a> in Management for accomplished mid-career executives and entrepreneurs, and a <a>Ph.D.</a> program. The school also offers a number of dual degrees jointly with other schools at <a>Stanford University</a> including <a>Earth Sciences</a>, <a>Education</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Law</a> and <a>Medicine</a>.   <a>left|thumb||Aerial view of the Graduate School of Business.</a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The school was founded in 1925. There are three Nobel Prize winners on the faculty, two recipients of the <a>John Bates Clark Award</a>, 15 members of the <a>American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, and three members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>. The gift will go largely toward construction of a $275 million campus, to be called the Knight Management Center, for the Business School. When construction is completed, the Stanford Business School will comprise the Knight Management Center and the Schwab Residential Center (named after alumnus Charles R. Schwab, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of the Charles Schwab Corporation).</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p> Stanford's MBA program was ranked 1st in the 2011 <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> ranking (tied with <a>Harvard Business School</a>), 3rd among US Schools in the 2010 <a>Financial Times</a> Global MBA Rankings  and 6th in <a>Business Week</a> business school rankings in 2008. <a>Forbes</a> ranked Stanford Business School 1st in its sixth biennial ranking of business schools in 2009. The <a>Economist magazine</a> ranked Stanford 4th in its 2008 business school ranking. In its biennial report &quot;Beyond Grey Pinstripes&quot;, the World Resources Institute and the Aspen Institute identified the Stanford Graduate School of Business as the leader among business schools that are incorporating academic content involving ethics, corporate social responsibility, and environmental sustainability into their curricula and activities. The ranking was based on an extensive survey in which schools were asked to describe cases, research, and course content that address these issues.  The MBA program at Stanford also ranked 1st in the latest Los Mejores MBA Globales published by <a>CNN Expansion</a> (2008). In the 2009 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a> Stanford Business School was ranked 5th in North America. <a>left|thumb|Aerial view of the Main Quad.</a></p>
<h2>Student profile</h2>
<p>The Stanford GSB is the most selective business school in the world. It has maintained the highest ratio of &quot;applicants to available seats&quot; of any business school in the U.S. for the last decade.  It has also had the lowest acceptance rates (typically &lt;10%) of any major business school in the world. For the class which entered in 2009, 6.7% of applicants were offered admission.</p>
<p>The school has approximately 380 students per year in its full-time two-year MBA program. It is relatively diverse compared to its peer institutions.  The most recent entering class was approximately 34% female, 25% ethnic minorities and 39% international. Current and past students include <a>Fulbright scholars</a>, <a>Marshall Scholars</a>, Coro, Gardner, Soros, <a>Rhodes</a>, Rotary, and <a>Truman fellows</a>. Approximately 15% of the class entered the MBA program with other graduate or professional degrees; including medical doctors, lawyers, and Ph.Ds. Stanford GSB also offers a <a>PhD in Management</a> degree for those looking to pursue a career in academia.  The PhD program is equally, if not more selective, than its MBA program.</p>
<p>The students at the school have traditionally maintained a policy of grade non-disclosure whereby they do not release grades. Some annual academic distinctions do exist.  Students graduating in the top ten percent of the class are designated &quot;Arjay Miller Scholars&quot;.  The top student receives the Henry Ford II award. The top 5 students during the first academic year are designated Siebel Scholars.</p>
<h2>New curriculum</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Schwab Residential Center, on campus residence for first year Sloan, PhD, and MBA candidates.</a> In June 2006, the School announced a dramatic change to its <a>curriculum</a> model.  The new model, dubbed &quot;The Personalized MBA Education&quot;, has four focus points.  First, it aims to offer each student a highly customized experience by offering broader menus of course topics and providing personal course-planning <a>mentoring</a> from Stanford Business School faculty advisors.  Second, the new program attempts to deepen the school&#x2019;s intellectual experience through several smaller, high-impact seminars focused on <a>critical analytical thinking</a>.  Third, the new program will increase global business education through both new course options and requiring <a>international experience</a> from all students.  Finally, the new program expands the schools focus on <a>leadership</a> and <a>communication</a> through new courses that examine students&#x2019; personal strengths in the topic.  Overall, the school sees the flexible program as an important point of differentiation that leverages the school&#x2019;s smaller relative size versus most other top MBA programs. The graduating class of 2009 was the first class having gone through the new curriculum.</p>
<h2>Organizational relationships</h2>
<p>Stanford GSB has a number of relationships with other leading business schools.  It offers a number of Executive Education programs jointly with <a>Harvard Business School</a>.  It also offers one of the three Sloan Fellows programs, coordinating with the others at the <a>MIT Sloan School of Management</a> and the <a>London Business School</a>. It is also a member of the <a>Global Business School Network</a>, which connects it to over 30 other business schools internationally.</p>
<h2>Alumni Association</h2>
<p>The Stanford Business School Alumni Association provides a wide range of opportunities, services and resources for their alumni, including local regional/chapter activities, special alumni events, continuing education programs, alumni career services, international conferences, reunion programs, Alumni/Student programs and password protected online services. <a>Alumni Statistics</a></p>
