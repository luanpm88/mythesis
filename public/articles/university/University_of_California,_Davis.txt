<p>The <strong>University of California, Davis, (UC Davis)</strong> is a <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Davis, California</a>, and one of ten campuses in the <a>University of California</a> system. Referred locally as <strong>UCD</strong>, the school was originally established in 1905 as the University Farm, an extension of <a>UC Berkeley</a>. UC Davis welcomed its first class in 1908. It was later formally established as a UC campus by the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> in 1959.</p>
<p>UC Davis' graduate and professional programs include the <a>UC Davis School of Medicine</a> (which includes the <a>UC Davis Medical Center</a>), the <a>UC Davis School of Law</a>, <a>UC Davis School of Education</a>, <a>UC Davis Graduate Studies</a>, <a>The Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing</a>, and the <a>UC Davis Graduate School of Management</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>UC Davis Aggies</a> compete in the NCAA Division I level primarily in the <a>Big West Conference</a> as well as <a>Great West Conference</a>, <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>, and <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in other sports. In its first year of full Division I status, 11 UC Davis teams qualified for NCAA post-season.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<pre>[[Image:Creamery and Horticulture buildings, UC Davis (postcard).jpg|thumb|left|Early Creamery and Horticulture buildings, University Farm]] In 1905, Governor [[George Pardee]] signed into law an act to establish a university farm school for the University of California (at the time, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] was the sole campus of the University). It would be more than a year before that commission selected a tiny town, then known as Davisville, as the site. What was to become the third UC Campus opened its doors to 40 degree students (all male) from UC Berkeley in January 1909 as the &quot;University Farm.&quot; (The farm had begun accepting non-degree farmers' short courses in October 1908; there were initially around 115 such attendees.) The establishment of the Farm was largely the result of the vision and perseverance of [[Peter J. Shields]], secretary of the State Agricultural Society, and the namesake of the future Peter J. Shields Library at UC Davis. [[Image:Petershields.jpg|thumb|right|Peter J. Shields, the &quot;Father of the Farm.&quot;]] Shields began to champion the cause of a University Farm to teach agriculture in a more applied fashion after hearing about California students who chose to go to out-of-state universities due to the lack of such programs in the University of California at that time. He later stated:</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>There was a College of Agriculture at Berkeley in connection with the University of California, but it was purely academic. It was largely confined to the study of botany and chemistry; it had no farm and little prestige; it was apt to be thought of as a snap curriculum, attracting students who wanted to go to college but wanted to avoid its more difficult work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After two failed bills, a law authorizing the creation of a University Farm was passed on March 18, 1905, and <a>Yolo County</a>, home to some of California's prime farmland, was chosen as the site. The Farm accepted its first female students in 1914 from Berkeley. Renamed in 1922 the <em>Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture</em>, it continued growing at a breakneck pace: in 1916 the Farm's 314 students occupied the original  campus, but by 1951 it had already expanded to a size of . In 1959, the campus was declared by the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> as the seventh general campus in the <a>University of California</a> system.</p>

<p>The undergraduate student government of UC Davis is the <a>Associated Students of UC Davis</a> (ASUCD), and has an annual operating budget of 10.5 million dollars, making it the best-funded student government in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCD includes an Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branch. Other than representing the student body on campus, the task of ASUCD is to lobby student interests to local and state government. Also under the purview of ASUCD are the student-run Coffee House is an ASUCD unit and <a>Unitrans</a>, the Davis public bus system. ASUCD employs thousands of students&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; annually across its many units.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Aerial view of UC Davis</a></p>
<p>The University of California, Davis campus is the largest campus in the UC system, spanning over  across two counties: <a>Yolo</a> and <a>Solano</a>. Located  west of <a>Sacramento</a> in the <a>Sacramento Valley</a>, part of California's <a>Central Valley</a>, it is adjacent to <a>Interstate Highway 80</a>. The Davis campus is the only school within the UC system with an <a>airport</a>, just west of main campus, and is one of two UC schools with its own <a>fire department</a>; the other being <a>UCSC</a>. It is also one of only two schools in the University of California system, the other being <a>UC Berkeley</a>, with a <a>nuclear</a> lab.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|University of California, Davis Fire Department|UC Davis fire engine</a> Towards the northeast end of campus is the Quad, a large rectangular field which sits adjacent to Freeborn Hall and the Memorial Union, which houses various establishments such as the UC Davis Bookstore, ASUCD Coffee House, food courts, Post Office, Sky Room, and the MU Games Area. The northeast side of campus holds more of the core buildings that were built earlier in UC Davis's history, such as Wellman Hall, Shields Library, <a>Mrak Hall</a>, and Hutchison Hall, as well as the North Entry Parking Structure. Also notable in this northeastern corner is the labyrinthine Social Sciences and Humanities building designed by <a>Antoine Predock</a>, known to students as the &quot;<a>Death Star</a>&quot; for its angular, metallic design.</p>
<p>The northwest end of campus holds the majority of the Segundo undergraduate housing complex and various alternative non-undergraduate housing such as Orchard Park, Russell Park, and The Colleges at LaRue Apartments. The Activities and Recreation Center, or the ARC, is also located near the Segundo complex. Off-campus to the northwest is the Cuarto undergraduate housing complex, which has two dining commons. [[Image:Arboretum, UC Davis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[University of California, Davis, Arboretum|Davis Arboretum]] walkway and garden on The Waterway.]] The Tercero undergraduate housing complex is located near the true geographic center of the UC Davis campus, to the north of the Arboretum Waterway, which stretches longitudinally through almost the entirety of the south end of campus. The <a>Davis Arboretum</a> is a public <a>botanic garden</a> with over 4,000 kinds of trees and plants, including many <a>California native plants</a>, that stretches for over  along The Waterway.</p>
<p>The majority of Equestrian Center, and Animal Sciences buildings are located near the Arboretum Waterway, away from the core campus; the West Entry Parking Complex, the Silo Union, and the newly constructed Science Lecture Hall and the Science Laboratory Building are located nearer to the Tercero residence halls and the core of campus. The <a>Mondavi Center</a>, home of the University Symphony Orchestra and other cultural events, is also located near the Tercero complex.</p>
<p>There are five public art statues found around campus, collectively called <a>The Egghead Series</a>, sculpted by former art professor <a>Robert Arneson</a> who taught at Davis from 1962-1991 before his death in 1992. The egghead statues are considered by many to be among the most recognizable features of UC Davis's campus, and have even inspired a recent <a>blog</a> maintained by University staff. Additional pieces of Arneson's work are part of the Fine Arts Collection maintained by the <a>Richard L. Nelson Gallery</a> located in the Art Building.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The Silo Union</a> &quot;Bookhead&quot; is located at the Shields Library plaza, &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot; is located at the Fine Arts Complex, &quot;See No Evil/Hear No Evil&quot; is at the east lawn of King Hall (the main building for UC Davis' School of Law), &quot;Eye on Mrak (Fatal Laff)&quot; is outside Mrak Hall (housing the registrar office and other administrative offices), and &quot;Stargazer&quot; is located between North Hall and Young Hall. The &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot; egg heads have been recast and duplicated for installment near the Port of San Francisco Ferry Building in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Bicycles, UC Davis</a><a>thumb|One of the double deckers in the city's student-run (and student-driven) bus system</a> UC Davis is famous for its large number of bicycles and bicyclists. The city of Davis boasts the highest number of bikes per capita of any US city. The city of Davis once held the record for the World's Largest bicycle parade. Bicyclists are ubiquitous around campus as well as the city, and thus a lot of bike-only infrastructure exists, such as bike circles, large bike lanes, and traffic signals exclusively for bikes. The UC Davis collegiate cycling team won several national championship titles.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The police department also has some of its officers patrol on bicycles. Furthermore, the police take bicycling under the influence (&quot;BUI&quot;) and bicycling without a headlight at night very seriously. All bikes on the UC Davis campus must be registered with a California Bicycle license.</p>
<p>UC Davis is also well known for its bus service, <a>Unitrans</a>, and its trademark London <a>double decker buses</a>. It has been in operation since 1968 and is believed to be the only general purpose (non-sightseeing) transit system in the U.S. to operate vintage double deck buses in daily service. The system is operated and managed entirely by students and offers fixed-route transportation throughout the city. There is also an <a>inter-campus bus service</a> that ferries back and forth between UC Davis and <a>UC Berkeley</a> twice daily, from Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>The central campus is bounded by freeways on two sides (Highway 113 and <a>Interstate 80</a>). All other UC campuses are either somewhat distant from the closest freeway or are directly adjacent to only one freeway. Two freeway exits are entirely within UCD's boundaries. One, off Highway 113, is signed &quot;UC Davis / Hutchison Drive&quot; and the other, off Interstate 80, is signed exclusively as &quot;UC Davis.&quot;</p>
<p>Easy freeway access, coupled with increasing housing costs in the city of Davis, have led to increased numbers of students commuting via automobile. Some students choose to live in the neighboring communities of <a>Sacramento</a>, <a>Dixon</a> or <a>Woodland</a>, and use their own cars or the county-wide Yolobus to get to UC Davis.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|Mondavi Center for the performing arts</a> The university has 102 undergraduate majors and 87 graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has a <a>Department of Viticulture and Enology</a> (concerning the scientific study of grape-growing and winemaking) that has been and continues to be responsible for significant advancements in winemaking utilized by many Californian wineries. The campus is noted for its Agricultural and Resource Economics programs, and the large Department of Animal Science through which students can study at the university's own on-campus <a>dairy</a>, meat-processing plant, <a>equestrian</a> facility, and experimental farm. Students of Environmental Horticulture and other botanical sciences have many acres of campus farmland and the <a>University of California, Davis, Arboretum</a> at their disposal. The Department of Applied Science was founded and formerly chaired by physicist <a>Edward Teller</a>. Dance, music, studio arts, and theatre are studied extensively on the campus, and the <a>Mondavi Center</a> for the Performing Arts features artists from all over the globe.</p>
<p>UC Davis undergraduate majors are divided into four colleges. The colleges are Letters and Science, Biological Science, Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, and Engineering. </p>
<p>UC Davis has several professional schools: <a>UC Davis Graduate Studies</a>, <a>Graduate School of Management</a>, <a>School of Education</a>, <a>School of Law</a>, California's only public School of Veterinary Medicine, <a>School of Medicine</a> and <a>School of Nursing</a>.</p>
<p>The university is also host to the largest Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program in California, with more than 120 cadets. With more than sixty years in existence, it currently commissions roughly 30 to 40 graduating seniors as second lieutenants every year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

The Peter J. Shields Library has three different architectural styles due to various construction and extensions being added; it is the main library where students study on-campus, with a 24-hour reading room, open computer labs, and unique furniture.</p>
<h2>Faculty and research</h2>
<p>According to the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, UC Davis spent $456,653,000 on research and development in the fiscal year 2002-2003, ranking it 14th in the nation. Specifically, UC Davis's expenditures nationally ranked first in agricultural research ($25,683,000), seventh in biological research ($118,477,000), and 13th in the life sciences ($336,796,000).</p>
<p>Its faculty includes 18 members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>, 6 members of the <a>National Academy of Engineering</a>, 7 members of the <a>American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, 2 <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners, 2 <a>MacArthur Fellows</a> and one member of the <a>Royal Society</a>.</p>
<p>The campus supports a number of research centers including: the <a>Information Center for the Environment</a>, the <a>Center for Health and the Environment</a>, the <a>Center for Visual Sciences</a>, the <a>Advanced Highway Maintenance Construction Technology Research Laboratory</a>, the <a>MIND Institute</a>, the <a>University of California Pavement Research Center</a>, and the very first university run <a>Energy Efficiency Center</a> in the Nation among others. The campus maintains <a>a web site</a> that publishes information and supports discussion about its research activities.</p>
<p>The <a>Crocker Nuclear Laboratory</a> on campus has had a <a>nuclear accelerator</a> since 1966.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Crocker Nuclear Laboratory</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crocker at 40&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is used by scientists and engineers from private industry, universities and government to research topics including <a>nuclear physics</a>, applied <a>solid state physics</a>, <a>radiation</a> effects, and <a>planetary geology</a> and <a>cosmogenics</a> &lt;ref&gt;<a>About Crocker Nuclear Laboratory</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>UC Davis is also one of 62 members in the prestigious <a>Association of American Universities</a> (as of 1996).

It consists of sixty universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|UC Davis Athletics logo</a> <a>thumb|UC Davis Aggies Marching Band</a> <a>Picnic Day</a>, UC Davis's annual Open House, is the largest student-run event in the United States. It attracts thousands of visitors each year with its many attractions. These include a parade, a magic show performed by the chemistry department, the Doxie Derby (<a>dachshund</a> races), film screenings, and a <a>Battle of the Bands</a> between the <a>Band</a> and other college bands including the <a>Cal Band</a>, the <a>Stanford Band</a>, and the Humboldt State Marching Band.</p>
<p>Another highlight of UC Davis is its student-run <a>freeform</a> radio station, <a>KDVS</a>. The station began operations on February 1, 1964 from the laundry room of the all-male dormitory Beckett Hall. The station soon gained a reputation by airing interviews with <a>Angela Davis</a> and a live call-in show with then <a>California Governor</a> <a>Ronald Reagan</a> in 1969. The station can now be heard on 90.3 <a>FM</a> and online at its website.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.kdvs.org/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>UC Davis has some 400 registered student organizations, ranging from political clubs to professional societies to language clubs. Student clubs are managed through the Student Programs and Activities Center (SPAC).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The academic Graduate Students and management students are represented by the <a>Graduate Student Association</a> (GSA). The Law Students are represented by <a>Law Students Association</a>.</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to wear Aggie Blue on game days to show their Aggie Pride. If spotted wearing Aggie Blue by the Aggie Pack, students may have UC Davis paraphernalia thrown at them as a reward.</p>
<p><a>thumb|The UC Davis Tae Kwon Do club</a> One less-known student tradition occurs during the commencement ceremonies, where students toss tortillas into the air at the beginning of the ceremony. Tortillas are smuggled into the building under graduation gowns and released into the air after all the graduates have taken their seats.</p>
<p>Other student activities</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Unitrans</a>, the student run (and driven) bus system.</li>
  <li>The <a>Coffee House</a>, also known as the CoHo, is a student run restaurant serving 7000 customers daily.</li>
  <li>The <a>Bike Barn</a>, a bicycle shop that sells and rents bicycles and cycling equipment, also operating a repair shop.</li>
  <li><a>KDVS</a>, student radio.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://kdvs.org/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</li>

<h3>The California Aggie</h3>
<p><a>UC Davis</a> also publishes a daily <a>student newspaper</a>, <em><a>The California Aggie</a></em>. The <em>Aggie</em> was first published in 1915 as the <em>Weekly Agricola</em> after its approval by the Associated Student Executive Committee. At this point, UC Davis was considered the University Farm, an extension of <a>UC Berkeley</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdavis.edu&quot;&gt;<a>UC Davis: Spotlight: Student news since 1915&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Initially, the <em>Weekly Agricola</em> was focused on both student news and farming-related topics. Novelist <a>Jack London</a> was one of the first readers of the <em>Weekly Agricola</em>. In 1922, it was renamed to match the school's athletic name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdavis.edu&quot;/&gt; Today, the <em>Aggie</em> has the largest print distribution in <a>Yolo County</a>, at around 12,000 copies distributed daily.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|UC Davis water tower</a> Social fraternities and sororities have been a part of the University of California at Davis since 1913. Approximately 8% of the university's undergraduate students are involved in the school's fraternities and sororities. One sorority, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>, was featured during the first season of the MTV reality show &quot;Sorority Life.&quot;</p>
<p>There are currently 16 fraternities that are a part of the Interfraternity Council (IFC) in Davis. The IFC representatives attend weekly meetings to guarantee that all UC Davis rules and regulations are followed. The meetings are also used to inform the fraternities about all upcoming activities throughout the week. The 16 fraternities are: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Gamma Omega, Chi Phi, Delta Chi, Delta Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Lambda Beta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, and Theta Xi. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Panehellenic Council is similar to the Interfraternity Council, but is the governing council for many sororities at UC Davis. They are responsible for organizing recruitment, and overseeing that all regulations are upheld. There are currently 8 sororities that are a part of the Panhellenic Council. The 8 sororities are: Alpha Chi Omega, alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>Phi Chapter of Alpha Gamma Rho</a> was locally established May 1 of 1923 at UC Davis making it the first continuously running national fraternity on campus. They started as the Kappa Tau Fraternity, which was the first Agricultural Fraternity on campus. Many campus buildings are named after alumni of Alpha Gamma Rho such as Emil Mrak (Mrak Hall, Registrar's office), Orville Thompson (Thompson Hall, Segundo student housing), and Dean De Carli (the De Carli room, 2nd floor MU), Mel Olson Scoreboard (Aggie Stadium), and many more. AGR Hall is located inside the Buehler Alumni / Visitor's Center and is commonly used as a conference room. There are both national and local fraternities and sororities at UCD with diverse backgrounds and histories.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Aggie Stadium (UC Davis).jpg|thumb|right|[[Aggie Stadium (UC Davis)|Aggie Stadium]]]] :<em>For more information, see <a>UC Davis Aggies</a></em> The UC Davis <a>Aggies</a> (or Ags) compete in NCAA <a>Division I</a> sports in the <a>Big West Conference</a>. For <a>football</a>, the Aggies compete in Division I <a>FCS</a> (formerly known as Division I-AA), and are members of the <a>Great West Conference</a>, granting UC Davis the distinction of being one of only three UC campuses to field a football team (<a>Cal</a> and <a>UCLA</a> being the other two). The Aggies are also members of the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in gymnastics and lacrosse, the <a>Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association</a> in <a>rowing</a>, and an associate member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> in wrestling.</p>
<p>The UC <a>Davis Men's Crew Club</a> is one of the more successful clubs both on campus and in the West. In 2008 the JV boat won first in nationals at the ACRA Championships in Tennessee and in 2009 the Varsity boat got second place in nationals at the ACRA Championships. They consistently compete against teams such as Stanford, the University of Washington and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Aggies finished first in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> six times in 2003 and won the <a>NACDA Directors' Cup</a> 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003. In 1998, the UC Davis men's basketball team won the NCAA <a>Division II</a> national championship despite being one of the few non-scholarship institutions in Division II at that time. They have also won NCAA Division II championships in Softball (2003), Men's Tennis (1992), and Women's Tennis (1990, 1993). These and other achievements motivated a decision (following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and the local community) in 2003 for the athletics program to re-classify to Division I.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|Aggies at Stanford (half-time show), September 17, 2005</a> The highlight of the recent 4-year transition to Division I occurred on September 17, 2005, when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored <a>Stanford</a> Cardinal at <a>Stanford Stadium</a> by a score of 20-17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game. The Aggies also pulled off an upset against Stanford in basketball just months later, beating the Cardinal 64-58 with a late rally at home on December 4, 2005. The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies' win loss record with Stanford to 5-1 for men's sports the 05-06 year.</p>
<p>The Aggie football team plays <a>Sacramento State</a> in the annual <a>Causeway Classic</a> for the <a>Causeway Carriage</a>. The team also plays <a>Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a> in the annual <a>Battle for the Golden Horseshoe</a>. UC Davis students gather at sporting events to rally as the <a>Aggie Pack</a>, the largest student-run school spirit organization in the United States. The Aggie Pack cheers on the sports team along with the <a>Spirit Squad</a> to the music of the <a>Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh!</a> and its alumni band. <a>Aggie Stadium</a> is the home of the UC Davis football and lacrosse teams.</p>
<p>UC Davis also has a noteworthy wrestling program, which competes in the Pac-10 at the Division I level. In 2007, UC Davis wrestler Derek Moore gained All-American status, as well as won the NCAA Division I Championships for his weight class. In addition, he received the &quot;Most Outstanding Wrestler&quot; award of the NCAA tournament. In so doing, Derek Moore became the first UC Davis student-athlete to become a NCAA champion at the Division I level. That same year, UC Davis finished within the top 25 for Division I collegiate wrestling programs in the country.</p>
<p>Wrestling was cut from the athletic department in April 2010. Other cuts included men's swimming, men's indoor track, and women's rowing. The athletic's department had to cut $1.79 million out of the budget. 14 women's teams and 9 men's teams will be funded for the 2010-2011 school year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The official school colors are blue and gold. The blue is due to the UC's early connection to Yale&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result is often referred to as &quot;<a>Yale Blue</a>&quot; (e.g., see &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), although UCD's official blue, usually called &quot;Aggie Blue&quot;, Pantone 295&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; differs from Yale Blue (approximately Pantone 289&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;).</p>
<p>The official school mascot is the <a>mustang</a>. Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school's agricultural heritage. Unlike most colleges, there is a distinction between the name for students and the mascot. There was a movement to change the school's mascot from the mustang to the <a>cow</a>, but despite student support this was turned down after opposition from alumni. Many people will call the mustang mascot of UC Davis an <a>Aggie</a>, but this is not its proper name; the mustang mascot is named Gunrock. The name dates to 1921 when the US Army brought a horse named <a>Gun Rock</a> to UC Davis to supply high-quality stock for cavalry horses. The mustang mascot was selected to honor that cavalry horse.</p>
