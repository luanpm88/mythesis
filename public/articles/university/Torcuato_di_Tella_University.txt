<h2>History</h2>
<p>The concept of the new university was developed by the university's first dean, <a>Gerardo della Paolera</a>, and the then Argentine ambassador to the United States, <a>Guido di Tella</a>.  They decided to adopt an American university model, and to create a research based university with small class sizes and professors with international studies and recognition.</p>
<p>Universidad Torcuato Di Tella was founded in 1991, with the mission of educating new generations of academics, and business, social and political leaders. It was founded by the Torcuato di Tella Foundation, making use of the experience and resources of the <a>Torcuato di Tella Institute</a>. The latter, a non-profit institute founded in 1958 to promote research in the interest scientific, cultural and artistic development in Argentina, became a leading local center for <a>avant-garde art</a> during the 1960s. The establishments' namesake, <a>Torcuato di Tella</a>, had been a leading Argentine industrialist through his <a>Siam di Tella</a> conglomerate (founded in 1911).</p>
<p>It began offering undergraduate studies in economics, but has since expanded and started offering undergraduate courses in business economics, political sciences, international studies, law, history, and, since 2007, architecture, as well as numerous graduate degrees.</p>
<p>Gerardo della Paolera was dean of Universidad Torcuato Di Tella from its foundation until 2001, when he was replaced by the current dean, Juan Pablo Nicolini. Nicolini was reelected to the deanship in 2005 ,and will be leaving it in September 2010, inelegible for reelection to the post due to term limits established by the university's charter. The reputed sociologist and political analyst <a>Manuel Mora y Araujo</a> was designated dean on May 14, 2009.</p>
