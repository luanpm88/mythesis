<p>The <strong>Joseph Medill School of Journalism</strong> is one of eight schools at <a>Northwestern University</a>.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Medill School was founded in 1921 and named after <a>Joseph Medill</a> (1823&#x2013;1899), owner and editor of the <em><a>Chicago Tribune</a></em>, which was then run by his grandsons <a>Robert R. McCormick</a> and <a>Joseph Medill Patterson</a>. It is headquartered on the southern end of Northwestern's campus in <a>Evanston, Illinois</a> campus, but it also opened a program in 2008 at  <a>Northwestern University in Qatar</a>,  a branch campus located in <a>Qatar</a>.</p>
<p>For many years the school's main location was in Fisk Hall. In fall 2002 the school opened the McCormick Tribune Center, which features a professional-grade TV studio and multimedia classrooms for Medill's growing emphasis on new forms of media.</p>
<p>The <a>journalism</a> program offers Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. The undergraduate curriculum requires a broad liberal arts education as well as the study and practice of journalism. The Integrated Marketing Communications program offers a master's degree over five quarters with concentrations in advertising, public relations, and direct, database and e-commerce marketing. , the school had 55 faculty and 684 undergraduate students. The project was also involved in the overturning of <a>Anthony Porter</a>'s conviction.</p>
<h2>Medill News Service - Chicago</h2>
<p>Medill Chicago is a working news bureau in downtown <a>Chicago</a> that operates as part of Northwestern University's graduate journalism program at the Medill School.</p>
<p>Medill graduate students have been providing news coverage to client newspapers since 1995. Each quarter, approximately 40 graduate students are assigned to cover stories about city and county government, the events in state and federal courts, business and economic development, health and science issues and the arts and sports.</p>
<h2>Medill News Service - Washington, DC</h2>
<p>Every Medill News Service journalist has the opportunity to spend a quarter in a <a>Washington, DC</a> covering breaking news as well as in-depth, enterprise stories on politics, civil rights, energy, technology or education. Medill journalists attend congressional proceedings, press conferences, conventions and congressional hearings and connect those stories to the communities they cover&#x2014;not an insider audience.</p>
<p>The Medill News Service serves newspapers, Web sites, television stations and radio stations, which all pay a quarterly fee to help cover production and communications costs. Print correspondents transmit stories electronically every day. Television stories are sent by network feed or satellite, or shipped overnight, as each station requires.</p>
<h2>&quot;Quotegate&quot; Controversy</h2>
<p>In a February 11, 2008 column written for the <em><a>Daily Northwestern</a></em>,  Medill senior David Spett questioned the use of anonymous sources by Dean <a>John Lavine</a> in a letter Lavine wrote for Medill's alumni magazine. Lavine attributed a quote praising a Medill marketing class to &quot;a Medill junior&quot; in the class. Spett reportedly called all 29 students enrolled in the class, including all five Medill juniors, and according to Spett, all denied saying the quote. Lavine denied fabricating the quote in a February 20 email to students, but expressed regret for what he called &quot;poor judgment&quot; in not keeping his notes.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;Quotegate&quot; controversy was the focus of stories, columns and editorials in local and national media, including the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, the <em><a>Chicago Sun-Times</a></em>, the <em><a>Washington Post</a></em> and <em><a>Editor &amp; Publisher</a></em>.</p>
