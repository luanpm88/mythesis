<p>  The <strong>University of California, San Francisco</strong> (<strong>UCSF</strong>) is one of the world's leading centers of health sciences research, patient care, and education. UCSF's medical, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing, and graduate schools are among the top health science professional schools in the world. The UCSF Medical Center is consistently ranked among the top 10 hospitals in the United States by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>. Some of UCSF's most renowned treatment centers include kidney and liver transplant, <a>radiology</a>, <a>neurosurgery</a>, <a>neurology</a>, <a>oncology</a>, <a>ophthalmology</a>, <a>gene therapy</a>, <a>women's health</a>, <a>fetal surgery</a>, <a>pediatrics</a>, and <a>internal medicine</a>. UCSF also has the nation's leading HIV/AIDS treatment and research centers. Collaborations with African Universities such as the <a>University of Zimbabwe</a> to deal with HIV have been established.   UCSF is administered separately from <a>Hastings College of Law</a>, another <a>UC</a> institution located in San Francisco.  In recent years, UCSF and UC Hastings have increased their collaboration, including the formation of the UCSF/Hastings Consortium on Law, Science, and Health Policy.</p>
<p>Founded in 1873, the mission of UCSF is to serve as a &quot;public university dedicated to saving lives and improving health.&quot; Though one of the ten campuses of the <a>University of California</a>, it is unique for being the only University of California campus dedicated solely to graduate education, and this in health and <a>biomedical science</a>s. UCSF has developed a reputation for unique interdisciplinary collaboration between the health science disciplines which has led to some of the most important discoveries in the biosciences. The graduate-focused environment of UCSF, its relatively small size, and its culture of collaboration allows for a flexibility to translate new discoveries into new treatments hard to find even at many of the world's other top medical centers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|UCSF in 1908, with the streetcar that used to run on Parnassus Avenue</a> UCSF traces its history to Dr. Hugh H. Toland, a <a>South Carolina</a> surgeon who found great success and wealth after moving to San Francisco in 1852.  A previous school, the Cooper Medical College of the <a>University of Pacific</a> (founded 1858), entered a period of uncertainty in 1862 when its founder, Dr. Elias Samuel Cooper, died.  </p>
<p>The <a>University of California</a> was founded in 1868, and by 1870 Toland Medical School began negotiating an affiliation with the new public university.  Negotiations between the Toland and the UC were complicated by Toland's demand that the medical school continue to bear his name, which he finally conceded.&lt;br&gt;On September 15, 1874, the school opened its doors to female students. </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Saunders Court, Parnassus campus</a> UCSF operates four major campus sites within the city of San Francisco and one in <a>Fresno</a>,&lt;br&gt;as well as numerous other minor sites scattered through San Francisco and the <a>Bay Area</a>.</p>
<h3>Parnassus</h3>
<p>Parnassus serves as the main campus and includes numerous research labs, the 600 bed UCSF Medical Center, <a>Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute</a>, and UCSF Children's Hospital. The Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy and the Biomedical Sciences graduate program are also located at Parnassus. It also houses the UCSF neurology outpatient practice that serves as a referral center of most of Northern California and <a>Reno</a>, Nevada.</p>
<p>UCSF's Beckman Vision Center is also located at the Parnassus campus. It is a center for the diagnosis, treatment and research of all areas of eye care, including <a>vision correction surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Also located on the Parnassus campus is the <a>UCSF Fetal Treatment Center</a>, multidisciplinary care center dedicated to the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of fetal birth defects.</p>
<h3>Mission Bay</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Mission Bay, UCSF</a> <a>thumb|Mission Bay Community Center</a> UCSF's <a>Mission Bay</a> Campus, also located in San Francisco, is the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. The  Mission Bay campus, opened in 2003 with construction still ongoing, contains additional research space and facilities to foster biotechnology and life sciences companies. It will double the size of UCSF's research enterprise over the next 10 years. The biotechnology company <a>Genentech</a> contributed $50&nbsp;million toward construction of a building as part of a <a>settlement</a> regarding alleged theft of UCSF technology several decades earlier. Also located on the Mission Bay campus, the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Hall was designed by <a>C&#x00e9;sar Pelli</a> and opened in February 2004. The building is named in honor of <a>Arthur Rock</a> and his wife, who made a $25&nbsp;million gift to the university. Byers Hall serves as the headquarters for the California Institute for Biomedical Research (QB3), a cooperative effort between the UC campuses at San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz. The building is named after venture capitalist <a>Brook Byers</a>, co-chair of UCSF's capital campaign that concluded in 2005 and raised over $1.6&nbsp;billion. Additionally, the William J. Rutter Center, designed along with the adjacent 600-space parking structure by <a>Ricardo Legorreta</a>, opened in October 2005 and contains a fitness and recreation center, swimming pools, student services, and conference facilities.  The building is named in honor of William J. Rutter, former <a>chairman</a> of the university's Department of Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics and co-founder of <a>Chiron Corporation</a>. A housing complex for 750 students and postdoctoral fellows and an 800-space parking garage also opened in late 2005. And a fourth research building, designed by [[Rafael Vi&#x00f1;oly]] and named the [<a>http://cancer.ucsf.edu/diller/index.php</a> Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building], opened in June 2009. Two additional research buildings designated for neuroscience and cardiovascular research are currently in the planning and design phase. UCSF is also in the early stages of planning for a new specialty hospital focused on women, children, and cancer to be built at the Mission Bay campus and scheduled to open by the end of 2014.</pre>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>The Mount Zion campus contains UCSF's <a>NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, its Women's Health Center, the <a>Osher Center</a> for <a>Integrative Medicine</a> and outpatient resources. The <a>San Francisco General Hospital</a> campus cares for the indigent population of San Francisco and contains San Francisco's only <a>Level I trauma center</a>. The hospital itself is owned and operated by the city of San Francisco, but many of its doctors carry UCSF affiliation and maintain research laboratories at the hospital campus. The earliest cases of <a>HIV/AIDS</a> were discovered at SF General Hospital in the 1980s. To this day SF General Hospital has the world's leading <a>HIV/AIDS treatment and research center</a>.</p>
<p>UCSF is also affiliated with the San Francisco <a>VA</a> Hospital and the <a>J. David Gladstone Institutes</a>, a private biomedical research entity that has recently moved to a new building adjacent to UCSF's Mission Bay campus. The headquarters of the new <a>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</a> are also located nearby in the Mission Bay neighborhood.</p>
