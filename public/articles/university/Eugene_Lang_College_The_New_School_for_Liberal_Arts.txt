<p><strong>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts</strong> is the <a>seminar</a>-style, undergraduate, <a>liberal arts college</a> of <a>The New School</a> university.  It is located on-campus in <a>New York City</a>'s <a>Greenwich Village</a> on West 11th Street off <a>6th Avenue</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts was founded as the Freshman Year Program at <a>The New School</a> in 1972 as a pre-college program for <a>high school</a> graduates. Three years later, in 1975, the Freshman Year Program was expanded to a full undergraduate program and renamed The Seminar College. In 1985, following a generous donation by well-known <a>philanthropist</a> and educational visionary <a>Eugene Lang</a> and his wife Theresa, the school was renamed Eugene Lang College. The college currently has an enrollment of over 1,345 students.</p>
<p>In 2005, the phrase &quot;The New School&quot; was inserted into the name of each division of <a>The New School</a> as part of a unification strategy initiated by the University's President Bob Kerrey; thus, Eugene Lang College was renamed <strong>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts</strong>; students and faculty refer to it as &quot;Lang.&quot;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The primary academic building for Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts.</a>Unlike most US universities, The New School has a &quot;student-directed curriculum&quot;, which does not require its undergraduates to take general education courses. Consequently, students at Lang are encouraged to explore before focusing on a major, selecting topics that are of interest to them.  The only &quot;required&quot; classes are two semesters of Writing the Essay.  These intensive writing classes - part composition class and part linguistics - have titles such as &quot;Going Underground,&quot; &quot;What's Love Got to Do With It?,&quot; &quot;Comedy as Critique,&quot; and &quot;Cruel Shoes: A Trek Through the Absurd.&quot;  Students are encouraged to tailor the program to their own interests and academic goals.</p>
<p>Eugene Lang college hosts some of The New School's most experimental and avant-garde courses, including: &quot;Heterodox Identities&quot;, &quot;NYC: Graphic Gotham&quot;, &quot;Punk &amp; Noise&quot;, &quot;Masculinity in Asia,&quot; &quot;Queer Culture&quot;, &quot;Theories of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop&quot;.  </p>
