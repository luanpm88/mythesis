<p>  <strong>California Polytechnic State University</strong>, or <strong>Cal Poly</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>San Luis Obispo, California</a>, <a>United States</a>. The university is one of <a>two</a> <a>polytechnic</a> <a>campus</a>es in the 23-member <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
<p>Comprising six distinct colleges, the university offers 70 undergraduate programs, 26 graduate programs and 6 teaching credentials/certificates. Specifically, the university's engineering, architecture, and agriculture colleges consistently place at the top of United States national academic rankings. In <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a><strong>s 2011 America's Best Colleges report, Cal Poly ranked as the #1 Public Master's University in the Western United States for the 18th consecutive year. U.S. New's describes the university's admission process as &quot;more selective&quot;, yielding an overall acceptance rate of 29% in fall 2010 (freshman acceptance rate: 32%, transfer acceptance rate: 13%). Cal Poly has over 117,000 living alumni and, in fall 2009, 19,325 students currently enrolled.</strong></em></p>
<p>According to an investigative report by the <em><a>Los Angeles Times</a></em>, in 2004 Cal Poly had the lowest rate of underrepresented minorities among all 30 California public universities with comprehensive undergraduate programs and was described as a &quot;largely white, middle-class campus&quot;; this same report stated that &quot;Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is the academic star of the CSU system.&quot; </p>
<p>Cal Poly is a member of the <a>American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)</a> and the <a>National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges</a>. Cal Poly is known for its &quot;learn by doing&quot; philosophy.  Cal Poly is one of four California State Universities that participate in the <a>Big West Conference</a> in athletics. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>The university's full, official name is &quot;California Polytechnic State University.&quot;  In common with many other polytechnic institutions, however, the university has also sanctioned an <a>elided</a> version of its full name for official use: &quot;Cal Poly&quot; (or the lengthier but less &quot;formal&quot; &quot;Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo&quot; when it is necessary to make a distinction between Cal Poly on the Central Coast and its former extension campus, <a>Cal Poly Pomona</a>).  The athletic department is also officially sanctioned to use the initials &quot;CP&quot;.  While Cal Poly is part of the California State University, it is improper to refer to the campus with names such as &quot;CSU San Luis Obispo&quot; or &quot;Cal State SLO&quot;, because Cal Poly officially retains the name it held before its acquisition by the CSU system. </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Cal Poly Performing Arts Center</a>Cal Poly was established in 1901 when <a>Governor Henry T. Gage</a> signed the California Polytechnic School Bill. The California Polytechnic School was built adjacent to <a>San Luis Obispo</a> and held its first classes on September 30, 1903, offering secondary (high school) courses of study. The first incoming class was 20 students. The school continued to grow steadily, except during a period from the mid 1910s to the early 1920s when <a>World War I</a> led to drops in enrollment and drastic budget cuts forced fewer class offerings.  </p>
<p>In 1924, Cal Poly was placed under the control of the California State Board of Education. In 1933, the Board of Education changed Cal Poly into a two year technical and <a>vocational</a> school. The institution began to offer <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees in 1940, with the first baccalaureate exercises held in 1942. The school was renamed the California State Polytechnic College in 1947 to better reflect its higher education offerings, and in 1949, a <a>Master of Arts</a> degree in education was added. In 1960, control of Cal Poly and all other state colleges was transferred from the State Board of Education to an independent Board of Trustees, which later became the <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
<p>The college was authorized to offer Master of Science degrees in 1967. From 1967 to 1970, the school&#x2019;s curriculum was reorganized into different units (such as the School of Science and Math, the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the School of Architecture, which was created in 1968). Cal Poly's <a>FM</a> radio station, <a>KCPR</a>, also began as a senior project in 1968. The state legislature changed the school&#x2019;s official name again in 1971 to California Polytechnic State University.  Since the 1970s, the university has seen steady enrollment growth and the construction of many significant buildings on campus.  Cal Poly celebrated its <a>centennial</a> in 2001, and kicked off a $225 million fundraising campaign, the largest fund raising effort ever undertaken in CSU history. The Centennial Campaign raised over $264 million dollars from over 81,000 donors, more than tripling the university&#x2019;s <a>endowment</a> from $43 million to $140 million. Cal Poly's endowment was ranked 301 out of 864 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada in 2009.</p>
<h3>Relationship with Cal Poly Pomona</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Dexter Lawn</a> <a>Cal Poly Pomona</a> began as a satellite campus of Cal Poly in 1938 when a completely equipped school and farm were donated by <a>Charles Voorhis</a> and his son Jerry Voorhis of <a>Pasadena, California</a>. The satellite campus was initially called the Voorhis Unit. The <a>W.K. Kellogg Foundation</a> then donated an 812 acre (3.3&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) horse ranch in <a>Pomona, California</a> to Cal Poly in 1949.  Located about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the Voorhis campus, the two became known as the Kellogg-Voorhis unit. The Kellogg-Voorhis unit broke off in 1966, becoming the fully independent university, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Since 1949, the San Luis Obispo and Pomona universities have cooperated on creating a float for the <a>Rose Parade</a>. Today, the long-running float program still boasts floats designed and constructed entirely by students year-round on both campuses.</p>
<h3>1960 Football team plane crash</h3>
<p></p>
<p>On October 29, 1960, a chartered plane carrying the Cal Poly <a>football</a> team, hours after a loss to <a>Bowling Green State University</a>, crashed on takeoff at the <a>Toledo Express Airport</a> in <a>Toledo, Ohio</a>. 22 of the 48 people on board were killed, including sixteen players.</p>
<h3>Female admissions</h3>
<p>In 1904, Cal Poly opened as a <a>coeducational</a> school with 40 new male students and 12 new female students. In 1930, Cal Poly banned females from the entire school until 1956 (26 years later) when Cal Poly once again began admitting female students. The university remains coeducational today.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In August 2010, Robert Glidden was announced as Interim President. <a>Warren J. Baker</a> was the previous president of the university, appointed to his post in 1979. In 2009, Baker announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2009-2010 academic year, prompting a presidential search which yielded no suitable candidates and ended with <a>California State University</a> <a>Chancellor</a> <a>Charles B. Reed</a> recommending that the search process be restarted in fall 2010. </p>
<p>The CSU Board of Trustees has appointed Robert Glidden as interim president effective 1 August 2010. Glidden was previously the president of <a>Ohio University</a> and served in academic leadership positions at <a>Florida State University</a>. Glidden will lead Cal Poly on an interim basis until a new permanent president can be named.</p>
<p>Cal Poly's vice president is Robert D. Koob, who rejoined the University in 2008. Koob was Cal Poly's vice president from 1990 until 1995, but left to become president of University of Northern Iowa from 1995&#x2013;2006.</p>
<h3>Cal Poly Corporation</h3>
<p>The Cal Poly Corporation is a separate non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation operating in concert with the university. Its primary role is to furnish non-academic services for the university such as eateries, the bookstore, and endowment administration. This arrangement is relatively common at many of California's public universities. The corporation was founded in 1941 and was known as the Cal Poly Foundation until February 1, 2006.</p>
<h3>Cal Poly Foundation</h3>
<p>The Cal Poly Foundation is the philanthropic auxiliary of the university.  The Foundation raises funds and manages the endowment and other gifts.</p>
<h3>Associated Students Inc.</h3>
<p>Associated Students Inc. (ASI) governs and enriches the quality of student life through social events and advocacy.  It is a complement to the educational mission of the university.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Sunset viewed from Yucca Ridge above the Cal Poly campus, April 2010.</a></p>
<p>Cal Poly is the second largest land-holding university in California, with holdings totaling 9678 acres (2nd only to UC Berkeley and 1st in the CSU system). Part of the Cal Poly property is the <a>Swanton Pacific Ranch</a>, a  ranch located in Santa Cruz County, California, outside the town of <a>Davenport</a>. The ranch provides educational and research opportunities, encompasses rangeland, livestock, and forestry operations for the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental sciences, and fosters Cal Poly&#x2019;s teaching philosophy of &#x201c;Learn by Doing&#x201d; with emphasis on sustainable management of agricultural practices.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>The Cal Poly Master Plan calls to increase student population from approximately 17,000 students to 20,000 students by the year 2020&#x2013;2021. To maintain the university's &quot;Learn by Doing&quot; philosophy and low class sizes, the master plan calls for an increase in classrooms, laboratories, and professors.</p>
<h4>Proposed expansion</h4>
<p>; The Center for Science and Mathematics :  Will replace aging &quot;spider&quot; Science Building 52 with a new  structure.  It will add new laboratories, classrooms, and studios to support the expanding population of the university.  It is planned to be the largest and most technologically advanced structure in Cal Poly once constructed.  In addition a Centennial Park will be constructed adjacent to the structure.</p>
<p>; Recreation Center Expansion : Will expand the Recreation center and triple its usable size.  Two new gym rooms, additional leisure pool, synthetic turf for sports complete fields, triple the size of exercise and weight training rooms (from  to 21,000 sq ft), and a multi-activity center are planned additions to the recreation center. (Student Vote passed on 28 Feb 08.  Construction began Fall 2008)</p>
<h4>Current construction</h4>
<p>; Engineering/Architecture Renovation and Replacement : Include a new building which will provide  of space of classrooms, laboratories, and rooms for student related needs/activities.</p>
<p>;University Union Renovation : For a more open and inviting feel for the UU Plaza, including upgrading the stage/event area, seating and landscape. The UU Plaza is a focal point for group events and social interactions.  Includes the demolition of the center planting area and the concrete steps separating the Union and the campus dining complex. The stage will be relocated and upgraded and landscaping will be added.</p>
<h3>Commuting</h3>
<p>Campus parking is limited. In its most recent survey of available parking spaces on campus, the Cal Poly University Police reported 2,615 general purpose parking spaces, 1,635 dorm resident spaces, and 6,621 total spaces. In its facilities Master Plan, the university admits that while more parking spots will be added, the actual ratio of parking to students will decrease since enrollment is expected to increase sharply. To resolve the disparity, the Master Plan calls on the university to reduce the demand for individual vehicle parking. As part of that plan, the university has constructed additional dorms and has tried to make campus life more enjoyable. However, many students would prefer not to live on campus for a variety of reasons, including alcohol restrictions and a mandatory meal plan for Freshmen. Recently, the school launched a public information campaign called &quot;Options&quot;, which seeks to educate students on commuting alternatives, though it is not clear that the campaign has had any effect. Additionally, the campus police discourage alternate forms of transportation such as skateboarding and rollerblading by prohibiting them on campus. Recent increases in parking costs and gas prices have caused a massive increase in the use of bicycles and buses.</p>
<p>Bicycle racks are available throughout the campus, but the off-campus student population is mostly centered in areas either close enough to walk or areas judged to be too far to ride a bicycle. The city's SLO Transit bus system provides service to and from campus. Since the buses are partially subsidized by student tuition, Cal Poly students can ride for free. Bus service throughout the county is provided by SLO Regional Transit Authority. Discounted passes are available to the Cal Poly community.</p>
