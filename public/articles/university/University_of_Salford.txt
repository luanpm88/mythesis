<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Salford</strong> is a <a>plate glass university</a> based in <a>Salford</a>, <a>Greater Manchester</a>, <a>England</a> with approximately 20,000 registered students. The main campus is about  west of <a>Manchester city centre</a>, on the <a>A6</a>, opposite the former home of the <a>physicist</a>, <a>James Prescott Joule</a> and the <a>Working Class Movement Library</a>. It is situated in  of parkland on the banks of the <a>River Irwell</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The university was founded in 1896 as the <strong>Royal Technical Institute, Salford</strong> following a merger of the <a>Salford</a> Working Men's College founded in 1858 and Pendleton Mechanics Institute founded in 1850. The Institute received royal letters, allowing the word 'Royal' to be appended, with the then <a>Duke and Duchess of York</a> (later to become <a>King George V</a> and Queen Mary) officiating at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, mechanical engineering, chemical works, textiles and construction dominated the industrial scene in <a>Salford</a> and led the choice of subjects on offer. Initially, students became part of one of nine departments: <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a> &amp; <a>Applied Physics</a>, <a>Building</a>, Dyeing, Spinning &amp; Weaving, Domestic, and <a>Art</a>. 1,240 students registered for the first session, and there were only 19 members of staff.</p>
<p>In 1921 the Institute was renamed the Royal Technical College, Salford, but in 1958 the institution split into two separate organisations. The break away college became the Peel Park Technical College but changed its name first to Salford Technical Institute in 1961, then to Salford College of Technology in 1970, and finally to University College Salford in 1992.</p>
<p>In 1963, the <a>Government</a> completed an inquiry into the state of <a>higher education</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a> and produced a report known as the <a>Robbins Committee Report</a>. It was this that paved the way for the Royal College of Advanced Technology (along with a number of other <a>Colleges of Advanced Technology</a>) to assume university status by <a>Royal Charter</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Royal College of Advanced Technology</em>, went on to become the University of Salford on 10 February 1967 when <a>Her Majesty The Queen</a> handed over the <a>Royal Charter</a>. The first <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> was Clifford Whitworth, after whom the university's main library is named. The first <a>chancellor</a> was <a>HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, who remained as the university's chancellor until 1991. <a>Prince Philip</a> took a &quot;keen interest&quot; in the university whilst in office which has continued since then, with him making a visit in 2008 to see the university's award winning acoustics laboratories.</p>
<p>In 1996, the break-away University College Salford (est.1958) and the University of Salford (est.1967) were formally merged into a single institution.</p>

<p><a>thumb|right|The Maxwell Building on the edge of the Peel Park Campus.</a> The main <strong>Peel Park</strong> campus is less than 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometres) from Manchester city centre on the banks of the <a>River Irwell</a>, adjacent to <a>Peel Park</a>, which first opened on 22 August 1846 and is said to be possibly the first public park in the world. A former president of the Students' Union described Salford in 2007 as &quot;a relaxed campus close to Manchester, but cheaper and greener.&quot; There is a mainline railway station adjacent to the campus, <a>Salford Crescent railway station</a> and a number of high frequency bus services to Manchester, Salford and <a>Bolton</a> and <a>Liverpool</a> along the A6. There are a number of other university facilities located within a mile of the main campus, namely the Frederick Road and Adelphi campuses. Most of the University administration is located along Salford Crescent (A6), opposite the Peel Campus. The <a>Salford Museum and Art Gallery</a>, said to be the first unconditionally free public library in England. is also located on the Peel Park Campus.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>International students come from <a>China</a>, <a>India</a>, <a>Pakistan</a>, <a>Saudi Arabia</a>, <a>Cyprus</a>, <a>Greece</a>, <a>Nigeria</a>, the <a>Irish Republic</a> and <a>Malaysia</a>. With its three colleges, 12 schools, nearly 20,000 students, and over 2,500 staff, Salford had a turnover of some &#x00a3;156m in 2006/07.</p>
<p>The university is a founding member of the <a>Northern Consortium</a> of universities.</p>
<p>In October 2008 it was announced that compulsory redundancies are likely at the university as part of a plan to save &#x00a3;12.5 million over three years. A notice by the university registrar said that Salford needed to invest &#x00a3;300 million in university estate and &#x00a3;40 million in moving the arts and media faculty to the &quot;MediaCityUK&quot; site at <a>Salford Quays</a>, where the <a>BBC</a> is to establish its northern headquarters. The notice went on to say that that these additional costs came in the context of a number of pressures: salary bills that had &quot;exceeded the university's expectations&quot;; a &quot;serious problem&quot; with student retention; the &quot;credit crunch&quot;; and three &quot;seriously underperforming&quot; schools. Affected schools include the School of Nursing, Salford Business School and the School of Community Health Sciences and Social Care .</p>
<h3>Teaching quality</h3>
<p>The university has given equal priority to enterprise alongside teaching and research for the past decade. Its commitment to making learning relevant to the outside world has contributed to the university being ranked in the top ten (out of all UK universities) for teaching excellence and top in the <a>North West</a> by a report in the journal <em>Quality in Higher Education</em> . According to <em><a>The Times</a></em>, Salford &quot;averaged 21 points out of 24 from 1996 onwards&quot; on teaching quality grades, &quot;with perfect scores for politics and biological sciences.&quot;. The newspaper also however, ranks Salford lowest out of all pre-1992 universities, currently ranking Salford 84th out of 114 UK institutions.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional strengths in Engineering, the university&#x2019;s School of the Built Environment is currently ranked in the UK top ten according to the Times UK University League Table.</p>

<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p></p>
<p>University House on the Peel Park Campus is home to the University of Salford Students' Union (USSU). As well as representing students, the union plays host to a number of services, including shops and a bar</p>
<p><strong>The Two Cities Boat Race</strong></p>
<p>The Two Cities Boat Race is an annual boat race which has been running since 1972. It is now an established event in the sporting and social calendar of Salford and Manchester. The event is also significant for the amount of work put in by volunteers from both universities, to help with event set-up, stewarding, and  programme selling, raising money for many different charities. In 2007 the recipient of the proceeds was SPARKS, a charity which supports medical research for children.</p>
<p><strong>UAU Champions</strong></p>
<p>In the season 1971-72 the University Rugby League club won the UAU Championship beating Sheffield University in the final at The Willows, the home of Salford Rugby League Club.</p>
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>The university provides five self-catered <a>halls of residence</a> accommodating students from all of the faculties and schools of the university. Four of the sites are owned and run by the university, whereas the Seaford Road iQ Village is owned and run by CRM Ltd in partnership with the university. All accommodation includes free gym membership and free internet access.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Eddie Colman and John Lester Courts</strong> These two blocks of flats contain 755 rooms in total, and each flat is shared between two, three or four people. The flats are the closest accommodation to Salford Shopping City in Pendleton&nbsp;&#x2013; colloquially referred to as 'the Precinct'. <a>Eddie Colman</a> and John Lester Courts were sold by the University of Salford to Campus Living Villages in December 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Horlock and Constantine Courts</strong> Constantine Court is the only <em>en suite</em> university-owned accommodation, consisting of 80 rooms in seven houses. This accommodation is located in the centre of the main university campus, and is situated close to the Students' Union shop, a bank and <a>Salford Crescent railway station</a>.

There are both houses (shared between 10-12 people) and flats (six people). Castle Irwell is a popular choice for first years, due to the cheap rent. There are also grass rugby and football pitches and several floodlit <a>AstroTurf</a> pitches used in society meetings and varsity rags.</p>
<p>This accommodation is the furthest from the main university campus but is served by a free university bus, running every half an hour. A taxi rank is situated outside Castle Irwell and it is near to various amenities in <a>Lower Broughton</a>, including takeaways and local shops.</p>
<p><strong>IQ Student Quarter</strong> This is the newest accommodation site, consisting of a square of houses around a central reception, lounge and laundry building.
