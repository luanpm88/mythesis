<p><strong>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Nantes</strong> is one of the leading <a>French</a> <a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a> of <a>engineering</a>.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Ecole Centrale de Nantes is located in <a>Nantes</a>, <a>France</a> (in a region called <a>Pays-de-la-Loire</a>). Nantes is only at two hours by train from Paris. Nantes is the sixth largest city in <a>France</a>, and is also located on the riverside of the <a>Loire</a> and only 50&nbsp;km away from the Atlantic coast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ecole Centrale Nantes was founded in 1919. Being first called <em>Institut Polytechnique de l'Ouest</em>, the school's courses were various:electricity,mecanics,chemistry and smelting works. In 1977, the school moved and took place in actual premises. In 1991, it became the <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> and since, belongs to the <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>. As a <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>, it implements a similar Centralien programme of engineering education as in <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lille</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lyon</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Marseille</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale Paris</a> and <a>Ecole Centrale de Pekin</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>There are lots of ways to become a student of The Ecole Centrale de Nantes. For foreign students, there are three different curricula (An Engineer Degree, a Master's Degree or a PhD). But the way to enter Ecole Centrale de Nantes is quite similar for these three. The admission depends on each university partner of <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em>. But generally, you can build a case and then have interviews with professors from the <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>. All these steps are made to decide if your level is high enough to follow the courses at <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>French students must succeed in a nationwide selective exam with numerus claususis called Concours Centrale-Supelec. In the French superior educational system, after the <a>Baccalaureat</a> (the equivalent of A-levels) students have two options: Either go to a faculty and make a specialization that gives them a License degree in 3 years and a Master degree in 5 years of study; Or they try to enter a <a>Classe pr&#x00e9;paratoire</a> and then try to integrate a <em><a>French</a> <a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>. The Concours Centrale-Supelec is one way to do so.</em></p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<h4>Engineering Trainee Programs</h4>
<p>Education at <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> is multidisciplinary and lasts from three to four years. During the first two years, students take mandatory classes in science (Mathematics, Physics); in engineering (Solid and Fluid Mechanics, Heat transfer, Digital image processing, Computer programming, electronics...) and in social sciences (Economics, Marketing, Management, foreign languages,...). Students are then offered to sign up for different engineering specialties during their last year at the school. During these 3 years, every student has to validate a minimum 4 months stay abroad, by a semester in a foreign partner university or by an abroad internship. Every student of the engineering trainee program receives the degree of &#x201c;ing&#x00e9;nieur de l'&#x00c9;cole centrale de Nantes&#x201d;, more commonly called &#x201c;ing&#x00e9;nieur centralien&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s equivalent to a European engineering master degree.</p>

<h2>National and international partnerships</h2>
<p>The Ecole Centrale de Nantes collaborates with numerous industrial and educational partners within France as well as in an international scope.</p>
<h3>National partnerships</h3>
<p><em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> is a public amenity and is thus a subject to the <a>French ministry of higher education and research</a>. The Ministry is responsible for the distribution of the allocated state funds and is thus an important partner of <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes </em>.</p>
<p>The five other grandes ecoles <a>Ecole Centrale Paris</a>, <a>Ecole Centrale de Lyon</a>, <a>Ecole Centrale de Lille</a>, <a>Ecole Centrale de Marseille</a> and <a>Ecole Centrale de Pekin</a> and <em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> have joined together and have formed the <a>Centrale Graduate School</a> alliance. Being a member of that alliance,<em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> offers the possibility to its students to enrich their education by attending courses of one of the 5 other members during an exchange.</p>
<p>Besides the members of the Central Graduate School alliance,<em>Ecole Centrale de Nantes</em> has numerous additional French educational partners, which are listed in the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Audencia</a></li>
