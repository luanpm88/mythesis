<p>The <strong>School of Business, Economics and Law</strong> at the <a>University of Gothenburg</a> (<a>Swedish</a>: <em>Handelsh&#x00f6;gskolan vid G&#x00f6;teborgs universitet</em>) is a <a>business school</a> in <a>Gothenburg</a>, <a>Sweden</a>. It was founded in 1923 as an independent business college and is situated in the centre of the city, between the districts <a>Vasastaden</a> and <a>Haga</a>. In 1961 it was integrated into the state-run university system, still as a separate college, but then was integrated into the <a>University of Gothenburg</a> in 1971. Different from the other colleges at the university, it continues to use a Swedish name form (<em>h&#x00f6;gskola</em>) which usually denotes an independent college.</p>
<p>A first major extension of the school's building was made in 1952 according to designs by the architect <a>Carl Nyr&#x00e9;n</a> (in <a>Functionalist</a> style); the second extension was made in 1995, with a new building in Neo-Functionalist style.</p>
