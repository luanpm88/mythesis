<p>    <strong>McMaster University</strong> (commonly referred as <strong>McMaster</strong> or <strong>Mac</strong>)  is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Hamilton</a>, <a>Ontario</a>. The main campus is located on  of land in the residential neighbourhood of <a>Westdale</a>, adjacent to Hamilton's <a>Royal Botanical Gardens</a>. The university operates six academic faculties, comprising of Engineering, Health Science, Humanities, Social Sciences, Science and the DeGroote School of Business. It is a member of the <a>Group of Thirteen</a>, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.</p>
<p>The university bears the name of <a>William McMaster</a>, a prominent Canadian <a>Senator</a> and banker whose substantial bequeathed funds helped form the beginning of the university. McMaster was incorporated under the terms of an act of the <a>Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> in 1887, merging the Toronto Baptist College with Woodstock College. McMaster was originally located in <a>Toronto</a> but moved to its present location in Hamilton in 1930. McMaster continued to be controlled by the <a>Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec</a> until it became a privately chartered, publicly funded non-denominational institution in 1957. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>McMaster University resulted from the outgrowth of educational initiatives undertaken by Baptists as early as the 1830s. Canadian Senator William McMaster, the first president of the <a>Canadian Bank of Commerce</a>, bequeathed funds to endow a university which was incorporated through a merger of Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College. In 1887 the <em>Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College</em> was granted <a>royal assent</a> and McMaster University was officially incorporated. The new University, housed in McMaster Hall in Toronto was sponsored by the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec as a sectarian undergraduate institution for its clergy and adherents. The first courses, initially limited to arts and theology, leading to the BA degree were taught in 1890, and the first degrees were conferred in 1894.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|McMaster University in Toronto circa 1906</a> As the university grew, McMaster Hall started to become more confined. The suggestion to move the university to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton's Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration began to debate the future of the university. The university nearly became federated with the <a>University of Toronto</a>, as had been the case with <a>Trinity College</a> and <a>Victoria College</a>. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer the university to Hamilton. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. By the 1940s the McMaster administration was under pressure to  modernize and expand the university's programs. During the <a>Second World War</a> and post-war periods the demand for technological expertise, particularly in the sciences, increased. This problem placed a strain on the finances of what was still a denominational Baptist institution. In particular, the institution could no longer secure sufficient funds from denominational sources alone to sustain science research. Since denominational institutions could not receive public funds, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec decided to reorganize the University, creating two federated colleges. The arts and divinity programs were reconstituted as University College and science was reorganized under the newly incorporated Hamilton College as a separate division capable of receiving provincial grants. Hamilton College was incorporated in 1948 by letters patent under <em>The Companies Act</em>, although it remained only affiliated with the university.</p>
<p><a>right|200px|thumb|Hamilton Hall was constructed in 1926 in preparation for the university's move to Hamilton.</a> Through the 1950s increased funding advanced the place of sciences within the institution. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the humanities and social sciences were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under <em>The McMaster University Act, 1957</em>, dissolving the two colleges, having its property vested to McMaster and becoming a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The University had traditionally focused on undergraduate studies, having not offered a PhD program until 1949. However, this also changed in 1957 with the creation of a Faculty of Graduate Studies, which was gradually expanded over the coming decades.</p>
<p>In 1965, with the support of the Ontario government, the University established a medical school and teaching hospital, graduating its first class of physicians in 1972. In 1968, the University was organized into the Divisions of Arts, Science, and Health Sciences each with its own Vice-President, while Divinity College continued under its existing arrangement. In 1974 the divisional structure of the university was dissolved and reorganized again under <em>The McMaster University Act, 1976</em> and the vice-presidents were replaced by a single Vice-President (Academic). It is connected to the Life Sciences building and the recently completed Michael DeGroote Centre for Learning &amp; Discovery, which houses many well-funded research groups in areas of <a>genetics</a>, <a>infectious diseases</a> and several specific conditions. </p>
<p>The McMaster Nuclear Reactor is a university-based research reactor that is today the only Canadian medium flux reactor in a university environment. It is a &quot;pool-type&quot; reactor with a core of enriched uranium fuel moderated and cooled by light water. The MNR provides a wide range of irradiation, laboratory and holding facilities which include a cyclotron, an accelerator, a small-angle neutron-scattering detector and wide-angle neutron scattering facilities.</p>
<p>McMaster's four libraries are all part of the collective McMaster University Libraries, which comprises 1,303,969 volumes and 3,495,444 total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and microfilm. Mills Library houses the Humanities and Social Sciences collections, with a wide range of print and digital resources. Innis Library houses content which supports the academic and research interests DeGroote School of Business. Thode Library houses academic material of various disciplines of science and engineering, while the Health Science Library houses books pertaining to the field to medical sciences.</p>
<h3>Housing and student life facilities</h3>
<p><a>right|200px|thumb|McMaster University Student Centre on the left next to Mills Library to the right</a> Currently McMaster has twelve smoke-free residence buildings totalling approximately 3,700 bed-spaces. The latest residence to be built is Les Prince Hall, a large co-ed building, completed in 2006. Prince was a long-serving hall master in the residence system, living with his family on campus until after his retirement in 1980. Building choices include the traditional room and board style, furnished apartment style and suite-style. Brandon Hall and Whidden Hall house the university's substance-free lifestyle living spaces.</p>
<p>The McMaster Residence System is composed of Residence Life Staff who provide guidance and help the transition to university life for many first-year students. Staff members are trained by Housing and Conference service employees and enforce policies which the university has put in place. They also provide programs for students that touch on one or more of its four pillars approach: Academic, Diversity &amp; Social Justice, Life-Skills &amp; Wellness, and Social. Residence students are represented by the Inter Residence Council (IRC), with two representatives in each residence building who represent the students at the upper administration level.</p>
<p>The McMaster University Student Centre (MUSC) is the center of student life and programming. It contains a caf&#x00e9;, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the CIBC Conference Hall. The MUSC also contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the <a>McMaster Students Union</a> and <em><a>The Silhouette</a></em> weekly newspaper as well as other services such as the Campus Health Centre and the campus dentist. The university also has over twenty dining outlets located throughout the campus, including two major residence dining facilities. Notably, the university has a number of vegetarian options, with a completely vegetarian cafe  known as Bridges Caf&#x00e9;. The university, as a result had been voted as the country's most vegan friendly university through <a>PETA</a> for a number of years. Several other dining outlets at McMaster have also garnered a number of awards throughout the years for food services.</p>
<h3>Off campus facilities</h3>
<p>McMaster University's DeGroote School of Business currently operates a  site in the neighbouring city of Burlington. Dubbed the Ron Joyce Centre, construction of the building began on June 17, 2009. The building itself is a four-story,  building. With the building's official opening on October 7, 2010, the Ron Joyce Centre currently fields both DeGroote's MBA program as well as their business management programs (both degree and non-degree programs). Considerations for the new building began in 2004 when McMaster University announced that in partnership with the neighbouring city of Burlington, planning on constructing a new arts and technology intensive campus in that city. In 2009, the City of Burlington, Halton Region, and McMaster University signed an official agreement laying out the timelines and next steps for the university's expansion into Burlington.</p>
<p>McMaster has a number of administrative offices at its Downtown Centre. The centre, located in downtown Hamilton, was formally the Wentworth County Courthouse. The centre also holds McMaster Centre for Continuing Education, which offers a variety of certificate and diploma programs as well as personal and professional development programs.</p>
<p>The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine also hosts a Waterloo Regional Campus in the downtown Kitchener, sharing facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the <a>University of Waterloo</a>. McMaster also hosts another regional campus in St. Catharines, although the university plans to move the Niagara Regional Campus to <a>Brock University</a> campus in 2011. These two campuses are referred to as the <em>regional campuses</em> and approximately 30 medical students in each year of the program attend each campus.</p>
<p>McMaster purchased a large industrial park three kilometres east of its main Hamilton campus in 2005 with the intention of redeveloping the site to contain an array of research facilities for the development of advanced manufacturing and materials, biotechnology, automotive and nanotechnology. In July 2005 the federal government announced that it would be relocating CANMET, a federal government materials research laboratory, from its <a>Ottawa</a> centre to Hamilton, helping spear-head the development of the McMaster Innovation Park. The <a>United Nations University</a>-International Network on Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH) is currently headquartered within the innovation park. UNU-INWEH is currently the only United Nations agency headquartered in Ontario and the only North American host site for a <a>United Nations University</a>.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The Office of Sustainability, created as the All-modes Commuting &amp; Transportation Office in 2002, is currently charged with promoting sustainable operations and growth at the university. The Office of Sustainability, headed by the Manager of University Sustainability, works with members of the university population, external community groups as well as the government. In November 2009, McMaster, along with the other members of the <a>Council of Ontario Universities</a>, signed a pledge known as <em>Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World</em>, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility. On 21 October 2010, the university had signed two accords addressing the issue of climate change, the <a>Talloires Declaration</a>, as well as the <em>University and College Presidents&#x2019; Climate Change Statement of Action for Canada</em>.</p>
<p>The university campus had received a B grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2011.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>[[Image:Petergeorgeatconvocation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Peter George (professor)|Peter George]] was the university's longest serving president, holding the office from 1995-2010.]] The governance of the university is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate, both of which were established in the <em>Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College</em> in 1887. Ex officio governors of the Board include the university's chancellor, president, and the chairman of the board-senate committee on long range planning. The Board also consists of 34 other governors either appointed or elected by the various members of the university's community. </p>
<p>The Senate on the other hand is responsible for the university's academics, including standards for admission into the university and qualifications for degrees, diplomas and certificates. </p>
<p>The president acts as the chief executive officer of the university under the authority of the Board and the Senate, and supervises over and direction of the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staffs. The office was created in 1949, with <a>George Gilmour</a> serving as the university's first president. The office of the vice-chancellor, created at the same time as the office of president, has always been held by the incumbent president of the university.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Programs, departments and schools at McMaster are currently divided among six faculties. By enrolment, the three largest programs were engineering, with 3,662 full time and part time students enrolled in the program, followed by the social sciences, with 3,376 full time and part time students enrolled in the program. At the graduate level, the School of Graduate Studies serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>McMaster is a publicly funded research university, which is a member of the <a>Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada</a>. The full-time undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school's enrolment, made up of 22,852 full time and part time undergraduate students. Students may also apply for financial aid through the federal and provincial government, such as the <a>Ontario Student Assistance Program</a> and <a>Canada Student Loans and Grants</a>. The financial aid provided by these institutions may come in the form of loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt-reduction, interest-relief and work programs.</p>
<h3>The McMaster Model</h3>
<p>McMaster functions on a semester system, operating year-round on academic semesters, fall/winter and spring/summer. The McMaster Model is the university's policy for student-centred, problem-based, interdisciplinary approach to learning, a policy which has been adopted around the world. Most medical schools in Canada and more than 80% of medical schools in the United States now employ PBL in their curriculum, and many international universities are continuing to do to the same.</p>
<p>In 1991, McMaster's <a>School of Medicine</a> had decided to adopt progress testing, developing the personal progress index (PPI), based on progress testing invented concurrently by the <a>University of Missouri-Kansas City</a>'s medical school and the <a>Maastricht University</a>. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at routine intervals to all students in the program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' increases in scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20% on their first write, and increase 5-7% with each successive write.</p>
<h3>Reputation</h3>
<p> McMaster University has consistently been ranked one of Canada's top universities. According to the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> rankings, the university ranked 88th in the world and the fourth highest in the country. Similarly, the 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> placed McMaster 93rd in the world, and the fourth in Canada. The 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the university 162nd in the world. In terms of national rankings, Maclean's had ranked McMaster 6th in their 2010 Medical Doctoral university rankings. McMaster was ranked despite opting out, along with several other universities in Canada from participating in their graduate survey since 2006.</p>
<p>In more specific fields of study, McMaster University was also ranked 40th in the ARWU 2010 in the field of social sciences, the highest in Ontario, and the second highest in the country. McMaster's Health Science program has consistently been ranked well within the top 100 of university rankings. In the 2010 Times Higher Education rankings of clinical, pre-clinical and health universities, McMaster's Health Science program ranked 30th in the world and the fourth in Canada. The program had also ranked within the <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> university rankings for life sciences and biomedicine, placing 82nd in the world and fourth in the country. In the field of clinical medicine and pharmacy, the ARWU in 2010 had similarly ranked the program 51st-75th in the world and third in Canada. In addition, McMaster's DeGroote School of Business has gathered both national and worldwide recognition as it was accredited by the <a>AACSB</a> in 2006. Less than 10 percent of business schools worldwide have earned this accreditation.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>[[Image:Nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Pictures of [[McMaster Nuclear Reactor]], when it was under construction in 1957, and the reactor in 2004.]] In Research Infosource's <em>Decade in Review</em>, McMaster was designated the top performer in research income growth from 1999 to 2009 in the medical doctoral category as well as the second-top performer in research intensity growth for the same period. For the year 2010, Research Infosource had ranked McMaster University the sixth most research intensive school in the country, averaging $309,400 per faculty member, well above the national average of $167,200. In 2004, McMaster earned the designation of research university based on its ability to attract and capitalize on its research income. Its research activities exceed those of universities twice its size and no Canadian university receives a higher proportion of research funding relative to its operating budget than McMaster.</p>
<p>In terms of research performance, <a>High Impact Universities</a> 2010 had ranked McMaster 62nd out of 500 universities and ranking fourth on the national scale. The university was also ranked 25th out of 500 universities, second in the country for research performance in the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacology, and health sciences. The university was also ranked 83rd out of 500 universities, ranking third nationally for research performance in the fields of engineering, computing and technology. In the fields of arts, humanities, business and social sciences, the university's research performance was ranked 60th out of 500 universities, again the third highest nationally. The <a>Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan</a> (HEEACT) had also ranked McMaster in its 2010 rankings 58th in the world and fourth nationally for research performance in social sciences.</p>
<p>McMaster has been particularly renowned for its academic strengths, most notably in the field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in Canada for biomedical and health care research revenues. In 2008-2009, Faculty investigators were overseeing $133 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. For its 2010 rankings, HEEACT had ranked McMaster 26th in the world and second on a national scale for scientific papers in <a>clinical medicine</a>. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute, the DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, and the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute. A portion of <a>Albert Einstein</a>'s brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.</p>
<p>McMaster has had a nuclear reactor Being primarily, in the early days, a nuclear structure laboratory, the academic direction of the laboratory fell to the <a>Physics</a> Department. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was tremendous with hundreds of graduate students trained and many publications generated. The reactor at McMaster is responsible for half of Canada's production of <a>iodine-125</a>. The production of <a>molybdenum-99</a> at the <a>National Research Universal Reactor</a> (NRU) has also been occasionally moved to the university's reactor, notably in 1970 and during the <a>2009 shutdown</a> of the NRU.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada and international students due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. From 2002 to 2003, the acceptance rate of the university was at 55.9%, although it had shown steady decline in the five years previous. McMaster's more high profile programs however, had carried much lower acceptance rates. The secondary school average for full-time first-year students at McMaster University was 84.9%. However, students entering McMaster's more selective undergraduate programs, such as its Health Science program and its <a>Arts and Science program</a> had a secondary school average of 95.1%. McMaster's medical school receives twice the number of applications as other medical programs in Canada, with more than 4,500 applicants competing for 204 positions. This format uses short, independent assessments in a timed circuit to obtain aggregate scores in interpersonal skills, professionalism, ethical/moral judgment, and critical thinking to assess candidates. The MMI has consistently shown to have a higher predictive validity for future performance than traditional interviews.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Iron Ring Clock.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Iron Ring Clock]] located in the McMaster University Student Centre]] The main student unions on administrative and policy issues are the McMaster Students Union for full-time undergraduates, the McMaster Association of Part-Time Students for part-time undergraduates and the McMaster Graduate Students Association for postgraduates. Student representative bodies also exist within the residence system. The aim of each of these groups is to facilitate communication between their respective student body, the university and other organizations.</p>
<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p>McMaster's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests, typically in the interests of academics, culture, religion, social issues and recreation. Many of them are centred on the McMaster University Student Centre, the <a>student activity center</a>. The university is also operates a chapter of the <a>Golden Key International Honour Society</a>. McMaster is home to two semi-professional acting companies, at the university level.  The McMaster Thespian Company, started in 2003, and <a>McMaster Musical Theatre</a>, started in the 1960s, presents productions annually involving student volunteer actors, musicians and crew.  The McMaster Engineering Musical is an annual musical production that is written, directed and cast by engineers that often features unique interpretations of popular songs or musicals. The university as well as the student union does not recognize any <a>fraternity or sororities</a> and existing chapters operate as non-accredited off-campus organizations. Only two fraternities currently operate an active chapter at the university, <a>Alpha Epsilon Pi</a> and <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>. </p>
<p>The university is also home to the student-run <em>The Silhouette</em> newspaper, the oldest student service at McMaster University and has been in publication since 1929. The <a>campus radio</a> station <a>CFMU-FM</a> (93.3 <a>FM</a>) is Canada&#x2019;s second oldest campus radio station and has been broadcasting since 1978. <a>MacInsiders</a>, an online student-run forum and information network, has been operating since 2007.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|100px|McMaster's athletic logo</a> Athletics at McMaster is currently managed by the university's student affairs, under their athletics &amp; recreation department. The university's varsity teams compete in the <a>Ontario University Athletics</a> (OUA) conference of the <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sports</a> (CIS). The varsity teams at McMaster have been known as the McMaster Marauders since 1948. The university's sports programs include baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, volleyball and water polo.  From 1969 to 2002, the men's water polo team had won the OUA championship 25 times, making it the most successful team in the university's history. The university's most successful team on the national level would be the men's wrestling team, winning the CIS championship four times, from 1984 to 1994. McMaster University has graduated 34 <a>Olympic</a> athletes, eight Olympic coaches, two Olympic administrators and two Olympic officials. As is mandatory for all members of the CIS, McMaster University does not give out full-ride athletic scholarships. </p>
<p>The university's sports facilities are located in the northeast corner of the main campus. The university has a number of sports facilities including the <a>David Braley Athletic Centre</a> and the <a>Ron Joyce Stadium</a>. Ron Joyce Stadium fields a full sized Canadian football field and <a>FIFA</a> sized soccer pitch. The stadium is also equipped with permanent seating for 5,500. Notably, Ron Joyce Stadium is not only used by the university's football team, but also as the training camp for the <a>Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a> of the <a>Canadian Football League</a>.</p>
<p>Intramural sport leagues and tournaments are widely participated at McMaster as well. Participation opportunities are offered at multiple skill levels and across a variety of sports to service a range of interest and abilities. Sport offerings include traditional sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer and cricket, as well as less traditional events like <a>dodgeball</a> and Extreme Potato Sack Racing.</p>
<h2>Insignias and other representations</h2>
<h3>Motto and songs</h3>
<p>McMaster motto chosen from <a>Colossians</a> 1:17, is &quot;&#x03a4;&#x0391;&#x00b7;&#x03a0;&#x0391;&#x039d;&#x03a4;&#x0391;&#x00b7;&#x0395;&#x039d;&#x00b7;&#x03a7;&#x03a1;&#x0399;&#x03a3;&#x03a4;&#x03a9;&#x0399;&#x00b7;&#x03a3;&#x03a5;&#x039d;&#x0395;&#x03a3;&#x03a4;&#x0397;&#x039a;&#x0395;&#x039d;&quot;. The motto was adopted in 1888 and translates to &quot;In Christ all things hold together&quot; or &quot;All things cohere in Christ&quot;. The motto itself is unusual in regards to the fact that it is in Greek. Typical university motto's when not in English, are usually in Latin, reflecting the origin of universities in mediaeval institutions in which Latin was more prominent than Greek. It has been said that McMaster's founders evidently desired to go back to the middle ages to the earliest days of the Christian faith, and therefore used the Greek form. </p>
<h3>Coat of arms</h3>
<p>After the university's move to Hamilton in 1930, the university had petitioned <a>Lord Lyon King of Arms</a> in <a>Edinburgh</a> for a coat of arms, which he would later grant on behalf of the Crown on 20 October 1930. On 1997, the Board of Governors in 1997 introduced a simplified shield design which had both recognized the tradition of McMaster&#x2019;s heraldry while improving the quality of print and electronic reproduction. </p>
<p>The design of McMaster's shield includes an eagle, which is symbolic of the heavenly vision, being able supposedly to gaze directly into the blazing mid-day sun. The cross on its breast identifies the university's vision as Christian in inspiration. The open book is a common symbol of learning, and the maple leaves signify that McMaster's Charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. The stag and oak tree itself were incorporated into the coat of arms as a tribute to Senator McMaster, who had used a stag and oak himself on his insignias. Throughout McMaster's history, faculty, alumni, and former students have played prominent roles in many different fields. McMaster also has a number of faculty as well as alumni who have earned <a>Nobel prizes</a> and awards such as the <a>Rhodes Scholarships</a>. Nobel Prize winners include alumni <a>Myron Scholes</a>, who was awarded the <a>Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> in 1997, faculty member <a>Bertram Brockhouse</a> who was awarded the <a>Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1994 and alumni <a>James Orbinski</a> who accepted the <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1992 on behalf of <a>Doctors Without Borders</a>.</p>
<p>Many former students have also gained local and national prominence for serving in government. <a>Lincoln Alexander</a> had served as <a>Lieutenant Governor of Ontario</a>, also becoming the first minority Lieutenant Governor in Canada. Two premiers from Canada, the current <a>premier from Ontario</a>, <a>Dalton McGuinty</a> and the former <a>premier of Saskatchewan</a>, <a>Tommy Douglas</a> were both graduates of McMaster University. A number of alumni have also made their mark in the fields of social sciences. Prominent faculty members in the field of social sciences includes <a>Ruth Landes</a>, a cultural anthropologists, and <a>Henry Giroux</a>, one of the founding theorists of <a>critical pedagogy</a>. A prominent alumnus in the field of social sciences was <a>Harold Innis</a>, who helped shaped both <a>communication theory</a> and the <a>staples thesis</a>.</p>
<p>A significant number of prominent business leaders have also studied at McMaster. Such examples include <a>Stephen Elop</a>, current president and CEO of <a>Nokia</a> and former president of <a>Microsoft</a>'s business division, James V. Sardo, former CEO and chairman of <a>Firestone Canada</a>, <a>Lynton Wilson</a>, current chairman of <a>Nortel</a> and chancellor of McMaster, William Waugh, former vice-president, <a>CFO</a> and director of <a>General Motors Canada</a>, Tayce Wakefield, former vice president of corporate affairs for General Motors Canada, <a>Michael Lee-Chin</a>, current chairman, CEO and <a>CIO</a> of <a>AIC Limited</a>, and Teresa Cascioli, current president and CEO of <a>Lakeport Brewing Company</a>.</p>
<p>Two members of McMaster University had traveled in space, including faculty member <a>Dafydd Williams</a>, who currently is a physician scientist at McMaster Centre for Medical Robotics at <a>St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton</a>,  and former alumni <a>Roberta Bondar</a>, who was the first Canadian woman in space.</p>
