<p><strong>Pepperdine University</strong> is an independent, private, medium-sized university affiliated with the <a>Churches of Christ</a>. The university's  campus overlooking the Pacific Ocean in <a>Malibu, California</a>, <a>United States</a>, is the location for Seaver College, the School of Law, the Graduate School of Education and Psychology, the Graziadio School of Business and Management, and the School of Public Policy.  Courses are taught in Malibu, at six graduate campuses in <a>southern California</a>, and at international campuses in <a>Germany</a>, <a>England</a>, <a>Italy</a>, <a>China</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>, and <a>Argentina</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>In February 1937, against the backdrop of the <a>Great Depression</a>, George Pepperdine founded the University as a Christian liberal arts college in the city of Los Angeles. On September 21, 1937, 167 new students from 22 different states and two other countries entered classes on a newly built campus on  at West 79th Street and South Vermont Avenue in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of <a>South Central Los Angeles</a> , referred to later as the Vermont Avenue campus.  By April 6, 1938, George Pepperdine College was fully accredited by the Northwest Association.</p>
<p>Pepperdine had built a fortune founding and developing the <a>Western Auto Supply Company</a>, which he started with a $5 investment, but his prosperity led to his greater ambition to discover &quot;how humanity can be helped most with the means entrusted to [his] care. [He] consider it wrong to build up a great fortune and use it selfishly.&quot; Mr. Pepperdine voiced his twofold objective for the college that bore his name, &quot;First, we want to provide first-class, fully accredited academic training in the liberal arts&nbsp;... Secondly, we are especially dedicated to a greater goal&#x2014;that of building in the student a Christ-like life, a love for the church, and a passion for the souls of mankind.&quot;</p>
<h3>Move to Malibu</h3>
<p>By the 1960s, the young college faced serious problems. The area around the Vermont Avenue campus developed issues with crime and urban decay; tensions also arose due to the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> and attempts to circumvent it such as <a>California Proposition 14</a>, which challenged federal <a>fair housing</a> laws. Similarly, another November 2007 fire in Corral Canyon, accidentally set off by a group of Los Angeles youths, caused an evacuation of the Drescher Campus.  However, most students were off-campus for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art</a> The main campus is located among several ridges that overlook the <a>Pacific Ocean</a> and the <a>Pacific Coast Highway</a> in <a>Malibu</a>, California. The main campus entrance road ascends a steep, well-groomed grassy slope past a huge stylized cross, known as the Phillips Theme Tower, symbolizing the university's dedication to its original Christian mission. Most buildings were constructed in a typical 1980s-style reinterpretation of classic Californian and <a>Mediterranean architecture</a> (red tile roofs, white stuccoed walls, large tinted windows). There are views of the Pacific Ocean, <a>Catalina Island</a>, <a>Palos Verdes Peninsula</a>, <a>Long Beach</a> and the westside of Los Angeles from numerous points. Graduations take place at Alumni Park, a broad expanse of lawn overlooking Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean. The main academic plaza for undergraduate programs of Seaver College lies just above Alumni Park and includes Stauffer Chapel, Tyler Campus Center, Payson Library, and the Ahmanson Fine Arts Center. Undergraduate housing and athletic facilities sit to the north/northwest of the academic complex. The Law School exists even higher above these areas. The central campus is surrounded by a loop road consisting of Seaver Drive, Huntsinger Circle, and John Tyler Drive. Banowsky Boulevard separates Alumni Park from the main academic complex and is named in honor of William S. Banowsky, the 4th president of Pepperdine.</p>
<p>Spur roads to the east of the central part of campus lead to faculty housing. To the northwest, Via Pacifica winds uphill to the <strong>Drescher Graduate Campus</strong>, completed in 2003 and home to the School of Public Policy, the Villa Graziadio conference center, as well as the fulltime programs of the Graziadio School of Business and Management and the Graduate School of Education and Psychology. Housing for graduate students, undergraduate honors students, and faculty are also located here. </p>
<h3>Graduate campuses</h3>
<p>The Graziadio School of Business and Management and the Graduate School of Education and Psychology are headquartered in <a>West Los Angeles</a> at the <a>Howard Hughes Center</a> next to <a>Interstate 405</a>. These two schools also offer programs at graduate campuses in <a>Encino</a>, <a>Irvine</a>, <a>Santa Clara</a>, and <a>Westlake Village</a>. International programs of the University's various schools take place in <a>London</a>, <a>Heidelberg</a>, <a>Florence</a>, <a>Buenos Aires</a>, <a>Paris</a>, <a>Madrid</a>, <a>Lausanne</a>, <a>Johannesburg</a>, <a>Tegucigalpa</a>, <a>Brisbane</a>, <a>Chiang Mai</a>, <a>Hong Kong</a> and <a>Tokyo</a>.</p>
