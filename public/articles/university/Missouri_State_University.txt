<p><strong>Missouri State University</strong> (<strong>MSU</strong> or <strong>Mo State</strong> formerly <strong>Southwest Missouri State University</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Springfield</a>, Missouri and founded in 1905. It is the state's second largest university, with an official enrollment of 20,949 for the Fall 2010 semester.  The Springfield campus is one of two degree granting institutions within the <a>Missouri State University System</a>, the other being a two-year campus in <a>West Plains, Missouri</a>. A bachelor of science in business from MSU is offered  at the <a>Missouri State University Branch Campus Dalian</a> in the People's Republic of China.  In addition to its main campus, MSU maintains a fruit research station in <a>Mountain Grove</a> and the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies program housed in <a>Fairfax, Virginia</a>.  The school is classified by the <a>Carnegie foundation</a> as one of six master's colleges and universities in Missouri. In 2010, MSU was selected for The <a>Princeton Review</a>&#x2019;s 2010 list of &#x201c;Best Colleges: Region by Region&#x201d; for the eighth consecutive year.  The school was ranked 52nd in the Midwest for 2011 by <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> in the category regional universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Missouri State University was founded as the <strong>Fourth District Normal School</strong>, by legislative action on March 17, 1905. Like other <a>normal school</a>s of the day, the school's primary purpose was the preparation of teachers for the <a>public school</a> system. </p>
<p><a>thumb|220px|left|Carrington Hall</a>The first class, totaling 543 students, started classes on June 11, 1906, in an off-campus facility. The first permanent campus building was Academic Hall. Its cornerstone was laid on August 10, 1907 and construction was completed in January 1909. The building is now known as Carrington Hall, named after William T. Carrington, the first president of the State Normal School. It serves as the University's administrative center. </p>
<p>The Fourth District Normal School became <strong>Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College</strong> in 1919 to reflect its regional and academic emphasis. Throughout the <a>interwar period</a>, the College's programs expanded to include <a>liberal arts</a> and sciences in the curriculum, thus facilitating a name change to <strong>Southwest Missouri State College</strong> in 1945. A burgeoning student population throughout the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the establishment of <a>residence hall</a>s, accompanied by a growth in post-graduate studies. This led to a third name change in 1972, to <strong>Southwest Missouri State University</strong>. In 1973, enrollment surpassed 10,000 students for the first time. </p>
<p>By 1985, SMSU had grown into the second-largest <a>public university</a> in the state, leading administrators to support a bill to change the name to Missouri State University, which eventually died in committee in the <a>Missouri General Assembly</a>. In 1990, enrollment surpassed 20,000 students for the first time, but further attempts to rename the school throughout the 1990s and early 2000s also failed. However, the state legislature did grant the university a statewide mission in <a>Public Affairs</a> in 1995. </p>
<p>In 2004, with the <a>centennial</a> of the university's founding approaching, legislators took it upon themselves to back a new name change attempt. It was opposed by the <a>University of Missouri System</a> (which operates the four campuses of the University of Missouri), which feared that the name change would lead to duplication of academic programs and ongoing battles for students and state funding. In 2005 the name-change bill was passed, following a late-night compromise between University of Missouri System President Elson Floyd and then-Southwest Missouri State President John Keiser, stating that Missouri State University would not duplicate certain programs offered by the University of Missouri. The bill to rename the University finally passed the Missouri Senate (25&#x2013;7). On March 1, 2005, after more than seven hours of debate, the bill passed the Missouri House (120&#x2013;35). The Governor signed it into law on March 17, 2005&#x2014;the centennial anniversary of the University&#x2014;at the Plaster Student Union where several student leaders and state leaders were present.</p>

<h3>Varsity sports</h3>
<p>Missouri State University sponsors <a>NCAA Division I</a> inter-collegiate athletic teams in men's and women's basketball, golf, soccer, swimming and <a>diving</a>; men's baseball and <a>football</a>; and women's <a>cross country</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>track</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>.  MSU teams are nicknamed the <a>Bears</a>, and team colors are maroon and white.  The Missouri State University Bears are members of the <a>Missouri Valley Conference</a> for all sports except football (<a>Missouri Valley Football Conference</a>), men's swimming and diving (<a>Sun Belt Conference</a>),  and field hockey (<a>Mid-American Conference</a>).  Football competes in the <a>NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision</a>. Missouri State teams have made 40 NCAA championship appearances since moving to Division I in the 1982&#x2013;83 season. Missouri Governor Matt Blunt quickly released criticism of the policy change calling it &quot;unnecessary and bad;&quot; also saying the decision &quot;bows to the forces of political correctness&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Grading policy</strong>: Missouri State University converted to a plus or minus grading system instead of the standard A,B,C,D, and F system starting with the Fall 2009 term. Individual professors can decide whether to use this grading system in their classes. Under the new grading scale, a C- will not qualify as a passing grade for courses requiring a C or better.</p>
<p><strong>Tobacco-free campus</strong>: Citing the proven detrimental health effects of tobacco use, effective August 15, 2010, Missouri State University enacted a policy further restricting the use of tobacco products on the campus.  Smoking is allowed only at designated smoking areas outside JQH Arena, Plaster Stadium, Hammons Student Center, and Juanita K. Hammons Hall during performances or events, and inside of private vehicles located on University parking lots. The use of smokeless tobacco is prohibited at all locations on campus.</p>
