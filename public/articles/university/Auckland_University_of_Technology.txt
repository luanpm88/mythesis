<p>The <strong>Auckland University of Technology</strong> (AUT) () is the newest <a>university</a> in <a>New Zealand</a>. It was formed on 1 January 2000 when the <em>Auckland Institute of Technology</em> was granted university status. Its primary campus is on Wellesley Street in Auckland's <a>Central business district</a> (CBD). AUT has two secondary campuses one is at Akoranga on the <a>North Shore</a> and the other campus is in <a>Manukau</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>AUT was originally founded as Auckland Technical School in 1895, offering evening classes only. Daytime classes began in 1906 and its name was changed to Auckland Technical College. In 1913 it was renamed Seddon Memorial Technical College. In the early 1960s educational reforms resulted in the separation of secondary and tertiary teaching; two educational establishments were formed; the tertiary (polytechnic) adopting the name Auckland Technical Institute (ATI) in 1963 and the secondary school continuing with the same name. For three years they co-existed on the same site, but by 1964 the secondary school had moved to a new site in <a>Western Springs</a> and eventually became <a>Western Springs College</a>.  In 1989 ATI became Auckland Institute of Technology (AIT), and the current name was adopted when <a>university</a> status was granted in 2000.</p>
<h2>University population</h2>
<p>In 2006 AUT had 22,000 students. A significant proportion were studying Bachelors degree or above (64.2%) and were full-time (64%), giving a total of 15,382 <a>full time equivalent</a> students. Approximately 2,980 international students attended the university in 2006. In 2006 there were 942 full time equivalent academic staff and 828 full time equivalent administrative and support staff.</p>
<h2>General information</h2>
<p>The process through which AUT was recognised as a university was controversial, as (for instance) it had an inadequate library at the time, and some students were given access to the University of Auckland's library as a stopgap measure. AUT's library grew rapidly and its size was not a significant factor with respect to the disciplines in which AUT taught and researched.</p>
<p>Despite controversial beginnings, the university is now well established. It promotes itself as an advocate of innovative approaches to teaching, learning and research. In particular its focus is on providing a pragmatic 'real world' approach, ensuring excellence in learning, teaching and developing outstanding graduates for practice in their chosen fields. In practice this reflects the continuing survival of vocational type courses and an emphasis upon student development towards employment. For this reason links with employers continue to be fostered.</p>
<p>AUT claims that it maintains very high levels of graduate employment in comparison to other NZ universities. </p>
<p>Since becoming a university, AUT has invested heavily in infrastructure, staffing and programmes. It is half way through its $245 million building programme on both the Wellesley and Akoranga Campuses. Since 2000, new engineering, design, library, and business buildings have been constructed.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|AUT Quad at Wellesley Campus</a> <a>thumb|Quad, Library and Business School</a> AUT has three campuses - Wellesley (Auckland CBD), Akoranga (North Shore) and Manukau (Manukau City). All campuses have student accommodation next door for a certain number of students. AUT runs a shuttle bus between all these campuses. AUT also maintains its own technology park in Penrose, Auckland City. Plans are also in place for a fourth campus.</p>
<h3>Wellesley campus</h3>
<p>The Wellesley campus spreads over several sites in the heart of central Auckland. The main campus is situated on Mayoral Drive, Wellesley Street, Symond and St Paul Street. The Faculties of Applied Humanities, Business, Design and Creative Technologies, and Te Ara Poutama, and the Applied Sciences division share this location.</p>
<h3>Akoranga campus</h3>
<p>The Akoranga campus is located on Akoranga Drive on the North Shore. The Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences (including the Sport and Recreation division) and School of Education share this campus, which has attractive park-like grounds. AUT's main sport and recreation centre is located at this campus.</p>
<h3>Manukau campus</h3>
<p>The AUT Manukau campus opened in 2010 offering a range of degrees and postgraduate programmes. The AUT Business Innovation Centre has already taken up permanent residence at the new Manukau Campus, moving from its previous location in Penrose.</p>

Programmes are offered in the areas/fields of applied sciences, art and design, business, communication studies, computer and information sciences, education, engineering, health care practice, hospitality and tourism, languages, mathematical science, midwifery, nursing, occupational therapy, oral health, paramedic and emergency services, physiotherapy, podiatry, psychology, psychotherapy, public health, rehabilitation and occupation studies, social science, sport and recreation, and Te Ara Poutama (<a>M&#x0101;ori</a> Studies). </p>

<p>AUT summer school offers over 150 papers for study.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Being the newest University, and therefore with a less mature research culture, it came last among the universities in the 2003 <a>Performance Based Research Fund</a> research evaluation exercise. The 2003 PBRF evaluation exercise had counted research conducted by AUT before it became a university as well as post-2000 work, which reflected a period of transition for the institution. The 2007 PBRF exercise assessed all the universities on an equal footing, with AUT having been a university throughout the whole of the assessment period (2000&#x2013;2005).  However, AUT again came last among the universities in the 2007 <a>Performance Based Research Fund</a> research evaluation exercise but growing its research score by more than any other university.</p>
<p>AUT is investing heavily in research and has established new research centres and institutes to further its research profile. Large numbers of leading local and international researchers and experts have been recruited by the university. Research partnerships and exchanges have also been established with some of the worlds leading universities. AUT's growing research profile and reputation has seen an increase in research programme enrolments and external funding.</p>
<p>AUT presently has 19 key research institutes:</p>

</ul>
<p>Within these key research institutes exist a large number of research centres and units.  The NIPHMHR administers the <a>Pacific Islands Families Study</a>.</p>
<h2>Pedagogy (Principles and methods of instruction)</h2>
<p>AUT differentiates itself from traditional universities in its approach to teaching and learning. A 'student-centred' approach is adopted by the university where students are actively engaged in their learning. High levels of communication occur between students and lecturers. This learning environment allows students to ask lecturers questions, work co-operatively with fellow students and receive feedback. This is achieved by having small interactive classes as opposed to traditional university lecture theatres. This is primarily a legacy of the polytechnic origins of the university, and whether it will continue to be a distinguishing feature will depend upon financial and other factors.</p>
