<h2>History</h2>
<p>A liberal arts college, Bethany was chartered on March 5, 1840, by the <a>Virginia</a> legislature and given &quot;all degree-granting powers&quot; of the <a>University of Virginia</a>.  West Virginia's secession from Virginia on June 20, 1863 recognized existing Virginia charters; Bethany College continues to operate under the Virginia charter today. </p>
<p>Founded by <a>Alexander Campbell</a>, who provided the land and funds for the first building and served as the first president, Bethany has been a four-year private liberal arts college affiliated with the <a>Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a>, since its inception. This religious body, of which Campbell was one of the principal founders, continues to support and encourage the College but exercises no sectarian control. An early center of <a>coeducation</a>, Bethany has admitted women since the 1880s.</p>
<p>The College's roots stem from the Buffalo Seminary founded in 1818 by Campbell and held in the <a>Alexander Campbell Mansion</a>, home of Alexander Campbell and <a>Thomas Campbell</a>, located less than a mile away from the College's present location.  <a>thumb|200px|right|Images of Bethany College, 1904</a> The College is the birthplace of <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, an international social fraternity founded in 1858.</p>
<p>Bethany's  campus is located in the northern panhandle of West Virginia in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>
