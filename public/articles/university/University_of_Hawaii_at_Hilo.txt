In 2006, UH Hilo opens its <a>Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii</a>.  By 2007, total investment of tenants at University Park is $800 million with the creation of over 400 jobs. In 2009, the first temporary buildings were placed on what is to become the permanent location of the new College of Pharmacy.</p>
<h2>Location and environment</h2>
<p>The University is located in the town of <a>Hilo</a>, on the east side of <a>Hawaii Island</a>, about  from Honolulu.  The town of <a>Hilo</a> offers a diverse, low-density population of about 45,000.  Within ten minutes of the main campus are shopping malls, theaters, and restaurants, as well as a major harbor and the <a>Hilo International Airport</a>.</p>
<p><a>Hilo</a> is set against <a>Mauna Kea</a> and <a>Mauna Loa</a>, two of the five volcanoes which form <a>Hawaii Island</a>, and the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>.  With over  of varying geography, there are more distinctive climate zones and ecosystem types on <a>Hawaii Island</a> than anywhere else in the State of Hawai<img>i.  <a>The island of Hawaii</a> offers snow-capped mountains, deserts, dormant and active volcanoes, lava flows, thick rainforests, numerous rivers, waterfalls, green pastures, and coastal reefs which drop off into deep ocean.  The University designs many of its programs for hands-on learning in the living laboratory surrounding the school.</p>
<p>Tropical foliage and numerous botanical gardens are located throughout the Hilo area, in addition to those on campus.  Trade winds bring abundant rains, occasionally heavy, with most of the precipitation tending to fall at night.  Daytime temperatures average near 80&#x00b0;F (26.6&#x00b0;C) with night time temperatures seldom falling below 65&#x00b0;F (18.3&#x00b0;C).  Due to regular rainfall, there are numerous covered walkways located between most of the buildings throughout UH Hilo's main campus.</p>
<p>The economy of Hawai<img>i Island is still in transition following the demise of the sugar industry in the 1990s.  Agriculture is diversifying; tourism is growing to include eco-tourism and edu-tourism; and astronomy facilities continue to develop an ever-larger scholarly and technical community to support the world renowned observatories atop <a>Mauna Kea</a>.</p>

<h2>College of Pharmacy</h2>
<p>The College of Pharmacy or <strong>CoP</strong> opened its doors for to an inaugural class of 90 students in August 2007. The four-year graduate curriculum leads to a <strong>Doctor of Pharmacy</strong> degree, also called a <strong><a>Pharm.D.</a></strong> degree.</p>
<p>The founding Dean of the College of Pharmacy, Dr. John M. Pezzuto, Ph.D., is an author of over 400 publications, co-inventor of several patents, the editor of three books, member of eleven editorial boards of international journals, and the current Editor-in-Chief of the <a>academic journal</a> <a>Pharmaceutical Biology</a>.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>The <a>Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education</a> (ACPE) accredits all pharmacy programs in the U.S. through a three-step process: Pre-Candidate status for programs that haven&#x2019;t enrolled students; Candidate Status, awarded to a program with students enrolled pending graduating its first class; and Full Accreditation.</p>
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> achieved the first step in the Pharmacy School Accreditation Process from the <a>ACPE</a> when it was granted Pre-Candidate Status in June 2007. The <strong>CoP</strong> became the first school in the State of Hawai<img>i recognized by the ACPE to offer the Doctor of Pharmacy (<a>Pharm.D.</a>) degree, and will graduate its first class in 2011.</p>
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> was awarded Candidate Accreditation Status during the June 2008 Executive Board Meeting of the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE), which was again reconfirmed in 2009. UH Hilo is on track and eligible in May 2011 to receive Full Accreditation when the first group of <a>Pharm.D.</a> students will graduate. Dean John Pezzuto said this is an important step that will help address a nationwide shortage of pharmacists.</p>
<p>The <strong>CoP</strong> was recently accredited by the <a>ACPE</a> as a provider of <a>continuing pharmacy education (CPE)</a> credits in July 2009. <a>ACPE</a> is also in charge of accrediting providers of continuing pharmacy education in addition to <a>pharmacy school</a>s. The accreditation by the ACPE was granted after the <strong>CoP</strong> was approved to offer <a>continuing medical education</a> (CME) by the Hawai<img>i Medical Association in May 2009. CPE programs sponsored by the <strong>CoP</strong> will cover the same broad range of topics in medicine and patient care, according to Dr. Karen Pellegrin, Chair of the Continuing Education Executive Committee and Director of Strategic Planning for the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>A temporary modular compound of three buildings with one lecture auditorium, laboratories, and offices have allowed the <strong>CoP</strong> to have a presence on the main UH Hilo campus since 2009. The <strong>CoP</strong> is on track to move forward with the building of additional teaching and research facilities, thanks to a newly announced $1 million gift from the J.M. Long Foundation. This gift will support the initial phase of a new health sciences complex. In recognition of this contribution from the J.M. Long Foundation; two lecture halls, a student center, and lanais will be named the Joseph M. Long Pavilion. Additionally, Hawai<img>i Governor <a>Linda Lingle</a> released $5.5 million for planning and design of a permanent building for the College of Pharmacy in October 2009. The state legislature had approved the funding earlier in the year.</p>
<h3>FNP/Pharm.D. and Possible Future Programs</h3>
<p>The University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo is planning to be the first school in the country to offer a dual degree with a Family Nurse Practitioner Specialty and Doctorate in Pharmacy (<a>FNP</a>/<a>Pharm.D.</a>), thanks to a congressionally directed $951,000 grant from the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The new program has been created and jointly offered by the <strong>College of Pharmacy</strong> and from the <strong>College of Arts and Sciences</strong>, Department of Nursing. This program is expected to begin in fall 2010 and will require a six-and-a-half-year commitment from the student, said Dr. Edward Fisher, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>CoP</strong> Dean John Pezzuto said the FNP/Pharm.D. degree would broaden the scope of practice of pharmacists through education and training in the diagnosis and hands-on management of common acute and chronic medical conditions. Additionally, a <a>FNP</a>/<a>Pharm.D.</a> dual degree would provide nurse practitioners detailed skills relating to medications and potential food and drug interactions.</p>
<p>With aid from the Department of Education grant, the College of Pharmacy also plans to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a general practice <a>pharmacy residency</a> program, as well as a drug information and medication therapy management center and <a>distance learning</a> program</li>
  <li>Develop a <a>clinical pharmacist</a> training model for rural and underserved areas in Hawai<img>i. A secondary benefit will be the production of a pharmacist workforce database that will assist in identifying areas in the state where pharmacy and pharmacist needs are not being met</li>
  <li>Enhance training of pharmacy students through the use of new technologies, such as <a>virtual laboratories</a></li>
  <li>Begin the planning phase for a <a>Doctor of Physical Therapy</a> (DPT) program</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hawai<img>i County Beacon Community Consortium</h3>
<p>A consortium led by the College of Pharmacy to use health information technology to provide better health care to Big Island residents has been awarded $16,091,390. <a>U.S. Vice President</a> <a>Joe Biden</a> and <a>U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> <a>Kathleen Sebelius</a> announced the award at a May 4, 2010 press conference in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The UH Hilo College of Pharmacy is the lead applicant organization for the grant from the Hawai<img>i County Beacon Community Consortium, a group of educators, health care providers, insurers and other community members. The group was formed to strengthen and use health information technology to continuously improve healthcare quality, cost-efficiency, and population health in Hawai<img>i County.</p>
<p><a>Hawaii County</a> is one of the 15 communities across the nation chosen to serve as pilot communities to develop wide-scale use of electronic medical records through the Beacon Communities program. The funds were awarded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is funded by the <a>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>.</p>
<h3>Rotations for 4th Year Students</h3>
<p>Students who are in their final year before earning their doctorate must complete the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE), also called &#x201c;rotations&#x201d;. Students in the inaugural class of 2011 are beginning this final portion of their schooling in the summer of 2010, and many have decided to earn their experience in Alaska.</p>
<p>APPE for the fourth-year students begins in the summer after their third year of pharmacy school and includes a minimum of 1,440 hours of pharmacy experiences as required by ACPE, the national accreditation board that oversees pharmacy schools. Students will participate in six different types of six-week rotations. Mandatory rotations include hospital practice, acute medicine, ambulatory care clinic and retail practice. The student may take an additional two electives to fulfill the APPE requirements.</p>
<p>After completing their rotations and receiving their Doctor of Pharmacy (<a>Pharm.D.</a>) at the May 2011 UH Hilo commencement, the graduates must still pass a national exam and then register in the state where they will begin their professional careers.</p>

<h2>Research at UH Hilo</h2>
<p>The University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo supports scholarly research activities by faculty, students and staff.  The university has steadily increased its extramural grant activity, while also establishing an intramural grant program to foster faculty and staff development. Additionally, the Research Corporation of the University of Hawai<img>i or <strong>RCUH</strong> helps to administrate the research activities across the <a>University of Hawaii system</a>.</p>
<p>The research activities at the University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo are coordinated by a Research Office, led by the Interim Vice Chancellor for Research, Dr. Daniel E. Brown.  A Research Council whose members are appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Research for three year terms, is the chief recommending body for the Vice Chancellor.  The Council administers the intramural grant program, proposes policies and procedures for extramural grant activities by the campus, and advises the Vice Chancellor on matters concerned with research and grant activity.  The UH Hilo Research Council is chaired by Dr. Ken Hon.  Limited general use research space is available both on and off campus. Faculty must apply for use of the space on an annual, competitive basis.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Prior to 1994, UH Hilo belonged to the <a>National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> or NAIA. The University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo Office of Intercollegiate Athletics has thirteen varsity teams as a member of the <a>NCAA Division II</a>, <a>Pacific West Conference</a>. UH Hilo has been a member of the <a>PacWest Conference</a> since 2004. The team name for the school is the Vulcans.</p>
<h2>What is a Vulcan?</h2>
<p>In 1965, a process was begun to adapt an individual identity for the University of Hawai<img>i at Hilo Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. Previously known as the &quot;Little Rainbows&quot;, the committee members focused on what would best represent the Island of Hawai<img>i. Active volcanoes were immediately thought of and one of the first considerations was &quot;Pele&quot;, the Hawaiian Volcano Goddess. However, out of respect for the Hawaiian Culture, the committee elected not to commercialize the Hawaiian deity.</p>
<p>In 1966, the University officially adopted &quot;Vulcan&quot; as their nickname. The Vulcan's colors are black and red.  Five main sports venues used by the Vulcans are the new UH Hilo Gymnasium, the Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium, Dr. Francis Wong Stadium, UH Hilo Tennis Courts, and the UH Hilo Softball Field.  The men's and women's soccer and women's basketball athletic programs were added in 2006.</p>
<p><a>Vulcan</a> is the Roman god of Fire and Volcanoes. He was an important member of the pantheon of the Romans. The Vulcan festival, Volcanalia, is held in Italy on August 23, each year. <a>Vulcan</a> is the patron god of artisans and blacksmiths. He was the son of <a>Jupiter</a> and <a>Juno</a> and his home was in the heart of <a>Mount Etna</a>. He fashioned Jupiter's magical thunderbolts and Cupid's arrows. His forge was thought to be the source of volcanic activity.</p>
<p><a>Vulcan's</a> Greek counterpart is <a>Hephaestus</a>, the God of Destructive Terrestrial Fire and Volcanic Fire. He was the divine inventor and builder of magical things. From Vulcan, we receive the term <a>Vulcanization</a>. This is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities, such as strength, elasticity, resistance to solvents, and rendering it impervious to moderate heat and cold.</p>

<h2>&quot;Hawai<img>i State University?&quot;</h2>
<p>There has been a sentiment among some in the community to separate the Hilo campus from the University of Hawai<img>i system, questioning the creation of a &quot;Hawai<img>i State University&quot;.  Supporters of the separation argued that the growing Hilo campus is &quot;shortchanged&quot; by its sister campus in M&#x0101;noa and that being independent of the system would allow the college to grow faster and draw in more money from independent sources, thus better serving the community.  Opponents argue that the state is too small for competing university systems and that financial divisions between M&#x0101;noa and Hilo are fair, given that historically M&#x0101;noa placed emphasis on research and Hilo placed emphasis on teaching.</p>
<p>Former UH Hilo Provost Charles B. Neff stated, &quot;I think (UH Hilo) should always be academically independent from M&#x0101;noa. The notion of making it administratively independent by establishing something like (a) Hawai<img>i State University doesn't make much sense... it won't become an economic salvation for Hilo.&quot; </p>
<p>A bill was introduced in the 2005 session of the House of Representatives of the Hawai<img>i State Legislature to draft legislation to spin off the Hilo campus as the independent Hawai<img>i State University. The bill was approved by the House Higher Education Committee but no hearing on the bill was planned by the House Finance Committee, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>UH Hilo in 2009 brought in over $20 million of grant and research money, more than any other in the UH system, prompting many to finally concede the fact that UH Hilo has reached the status of &quot;research university&quot;. The addition of the College of Pharmacy was a pinnacle achievement for UH Hilo and with the new development of permanent buildings on the horizon, UH Hilo will look more like a full-fledged research facility.</p>
<p>A recent discussion with an unnamed professor about any immediate future possibility of a Hawai<img>i State University was quoted stating &quot;the recent grant money received solidified the connection between UH M&#x0101;noa and UH Hilo, strengthening the relationship of the two campuses to new levels and there is no chance of a breakaway from the UH system in the foreseen future.&quot;</p>
