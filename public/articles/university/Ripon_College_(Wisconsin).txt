<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1851, but its first class of students did not enroll until 1853. Ripon's first class, four women, graduated in June, 1867. In 1868 formal ties with <a>Presbyterian</a> and <a>Congregational</a> churches were cut, but Ripon remained somewhat religious for much of its history. During the 19th century students were required to attend two church services each Sunday. The first six presidents of Ripon College had clerical backgrounds, as does the current president.  The college recognized social and academic Greek letter societies in 1924. The Ripon Chapter of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> was started by Dr. Clark Kuebler, who served as president from 1944-1955. The <a>National Forensic League</a>, which is still located in Ripon, Wisconsin, was founded at the college in 1925.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Students choose from 32 majors, ranging from the arts to the social sciences to the hard sciences to pre-professional programs.    Ripon is a member of the <a>Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM)</a>, a grouping of private liberal arts schools that share expertise and collaborate on off-campus study programs.  Internationally renowned <a>economist</a> <a>Alfred E. Kahn</a> served as Chairman of the Department of Economics for several years, and the present faculty includes <a>Peg Lautenschlager</a>, former Attorney General of Wisconsin.</p>
<h2>Arts</h2>
<p>The college's Rodman Center for the Arts houses the Departments of Art, Music, and Theater.  The Art Department manages two gallery spaces, one of which is dedicated to student work and the other to art more broadly.  Student work is also shown across campus.  Two art works of note in the permanent collection of the college are life-size portraits by <a>Anthony van Dyck</a> of <a>Princess Amalia</a> of the <a>House of Orange</a> and Sir <a>Roger Townshend</a>.  The Classics department manages a collection of classical Greek and Roman <a>artifact</a>s, many of which are displayed in the campus library.  A sculpture garden is located adjacent to the building.  Musical groups on campus include an orchestra, wind band, jazz ensemble, choral group, and drumline.  </p>
<h2>Campus culture</h2>
<h3>Free bicycles</h3>
<p>Ripon is offering new freshmen in fall 2009 the option of receiving a free Trek 820 mountain bike, helmet, and U-lock if they pledge not to bring a car to campus for the entire year. The &quot;velorution&quot; bike program aims to encourage environmentally-friendly transportation, cut down on traffic, encourage athleticism, and limit the amount of necessary student parking lots in the rural campus.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>The college has seven residential dormitories with several sororities, including <a>Alpha Delta Pi</a>, <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a> and the local sorority, <a>Delta Psi Delta</a>, which recently changed to national sorority Kappa Delta. The college has four all-male fraternities including chapters of <a>Sigma Chi</a>, <a>Theta Chi</a>, <a>Phi Delta Theta</a>, and a local fraternity, Phi Kappa Pi, (named Merriman for the college's founding president). Ripon College also has one local co-ed fraternity, <a>Theta Sigma Tau</a>, founded in 1910, the oldest local fraternity on campus. It became co-ed in 1980 after severing ties with <a>Sigma Nu</a> fraternity. All five of the fraternities live in dormitories on campus, following the recent removal of Phi Kappa Pi from Merriman Houuse. Phi Kappa Pi will only be living in the dormitories for this up coming year, for then it will be back in its newly renovated house.</p>
