<p> <a>right|thumb|250px|Photo of Eureka College, 1904</a> <strong>Eureka College</strong> is a <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Eureka, Illinois</a> related by covenant to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and founded in 1855. It has a strong focus on history, political science, and the fine and performing arts.  Enrollment is about 765 students. </p>
<p>The college was founded by a group of abolitionists who had left <a>Kentucky</a> because of their opposition to slavery. When the school opened its doors it became the first school in Illinois (and only the third in the United States) to educate women on an equal basis with men.</p>
<p>Athletics participates at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level.  There are teams for men's and women's soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming, golf and track, as well as football, volleyball, baseball and softball.  Starting in fall 2006, teams will compete as part of the <a>St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a>.  Eureka College was a member of the <a>Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1910-1942.</p>
<p>The school's main library, Melick Library, was named in honor of Wesley M. Melick and Clinton F. Melick.  The building was dedicated on September 28, 1967, by California Governor and Eureka College alumnus <a>Ronald Reagan</a> '32, who was later elected <a>President of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Eureka College failed the Education Department's financial-responsibility test in the years 2007-09.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The academic program at Eureka College seeks to maintain a balance between requirements which all students must meet and freedom for each student to select those courses which will best match and further one's own interests, skills, and life plan. The structure of the curriculum has been designed to reflect this balance.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The College requires that each student acquire and display skills in composition, and mathematics. The College also requires that each student devote a portion of time to the study of humanities, fine and performing arts, natural sciences, and social sciences. These distributional requirements insure that each student will have the opportunity to explore that body of knowledge which is our common cultural heritage.</p>
