<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|ESCP Europe in Paris, avenue de la R&#x00e9;publique. The dedicated building was completed in 1859</a> <strong>ESCP Europe</strong> is the result of a merger in 2000 of two institutions: the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> and the <em>EAP</em> (<em>Ecole Europ&#x00e9;enne des Affaires</em>).</p>
<p>The <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> was founded in 1819 by a circle of economists and traders including the famous economist <a>Jean-Baptiste Say</a> and the banker Vital Roux. As such, it is the oldest establishment dedicated to <a>business</a> and <a>finance</a> teaching in the world. It was modeled on the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was much more modest in its beginnings, mainly because it had not been supported by the state. It gradually gained in stature and importance during the 19th century and moved to its current location, <em>avenue de la R&#x00e9;publique</em>, in Paris, in 1859. The 20th century gave importance to business studies, and soon enough the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> saw its importance rise. Its popularity meant it had to develop a rigorous selection process. By the mid-20th century, the school was considered an elite institution and admitted its students after two years of dedicated <a>preparatory classes</a> through a competitive entrance exam.</p>
<p>The <em>EAP</em> (<em>European School of Management</em>) was created in 1973 as a result of a European initiative to create a trans-national elite business school. From its inception, the school had campuses in four major European cities: Paris, Oxford, D&#x00fc;sseldorf, and Madrid.  The D&#x00fc;sseldorf campus moved to Berlin in 1984.  Students were recruited after two years preparatory classes in France and after a Bachelor's degree in the UK through a competitive entrance exam.</p>
<p>In 2000, the <em>&#x00c9;cole Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Commerce de Paris</em> merged with the <em>EAP-Ecole Europ&#x00e9;enne des Affaires</em> to form the <strong>ESCP-EAP</strong> European School of Management. This merger was the starting point for the new long-term strategy of the school to train managers able to adapt to any culture and work in any country and to gain international visibility. It adopted the slogan &quot;Learn everywhere, Manage anywhere&quot;.  In 2004 it added a campus in Turin and in 2005 it moved its Oxford campus to London.</p>
<p>In April 2009, the school changed its name from ESCP-EAP to <strong>ESCP Europe</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Master in Management</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|ESCP Europe Turin</a> The <em>Master in Management - MIM</em> is a pre-experience program enrolling strictly selected students. It is the flagship programme of the <strong>ESCP Europe</strong>. In that it exemplifies the two century long standing of this French originated, now European &quot;Grande Ecole&quot;. Each year, over 4,500 candidates apply for 475 places in the three-year programme. Over 52% of students are from outside of France, representing 70 nationalities in total. Some 100 additional places are available for direct entry straight into the second year of the program.</p>
