<p> The <strong>Technical University of Denmark</strong> (), often simply referred to as <strong>DTU</strong>, is a university just north of <a>Copenhagen</a>, <a>Denmark</a>. It was founded in 1829 at the initiative of <a>Hans Christian &#x00d8;rsted</a> as Denmark's first <a>polytechnic</a>, and is today ranked among Europe's leading engineering institutions, and the best engineering university in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>The student union at DTU is the 161-year old <a>Polyteknisk Forening</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>DTU was founded in 1829 as the 'College of Advanced Technology' (Danish: Den Polytekniske L&#x00e6;reanstalt) with the <a>physicist</a> <a>Hans Christian &#x00d8;rsted</a>, then a professor at the <a>University of Copenhagen</a>, as one of the driving forces. The inspiration was the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> in Paris which &#x00d8;rsted had visited as a young scientist. The new institution was inaugurated on 5 November 1829 with &#x00d8;rsted as its <a>principal</a>, a position he held until his death in 1851.</p>
<p>The new college's first home was two buildings in Studiestr&#x00e6;de and St- Oederstr&#x00e6;de in central Copenhagen but although expanded several times they remained inadequate and in 1890 a new building complex was inaugurated in S&#x00f8;lvgade in 1890. The new buildings were designed by the architect <a>Johan Daniel Herholdt</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>The university is governed by a board consisting of 10 members: 6 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 1 member is appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students.</p>
<p>The President of DTU is appointed by the university board. The president in turn appoints deans, and deans appoint heads of departments.</p>
<p>Since DTU has no faculty senate, and since the faculty is not involved in the appointment of president, deans, or department heads, the university has no faculty governance.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The university is located on a plain known as <a>Lundtoftesletten</a> in the northeastern end of the city of <a>Lyngby</a>. The area was previously home to the airfield <a>Lundtofte Flyveplads</a>.</p>
<p>The campus is roughly divided in half by the road Anker Engelunds Vej going in the east-west direction, and, perpendicular to that, by two lengthy, collinear roads located on either side of a <a>parking lot</a>. The campus is thus divided into four parts, referred to as quadrants, numbered 1 through 4 in correspondence with the conventional numbering of quadrants in the <a>Cartesian coordinate system</a> with north upwards.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>DTU was the subject of controversy in 2009 because the former institute director of the Department of Chemistry was a high-ranking member of <a>Scientology</a>. In relation to this, the university was accused of violating the principles of free speech by threatening to fire employees who voice their criticism of the institute director. On 7 April 2010, his successor was announced, at a department meeting, as Erling Stenby, who officially took over as Director on 1 May 2010.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>

<h2>Management and freedom of speech controversy</h2>
<p>The head of department at DTU Chemistry, Ole W. S&#x00f8;rensen, has been the centre of several controversial events: An associate professor who had negotiated a bonus with the university, was threatened that the course she was teaching would be cancelled if she accepted the bonus. After she accepted the bonus, Ole W. S&#x00f8;rensen cancelled the course. A journalist covering the case reported that employees preferred to speak anonymously and without use of the university email system, but that only one employee, Rolf W. Berg, went on record by name, blaming the problems on the absence of a faculty role in the governance of DTU. </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the university management threatened Rolf W. Berg with dismissal for publicly criticizing the university.</p>
