<p> </p>
<p> <strong>Miami University</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>) is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Oxford</a>, <a>Ohio</a>, <a>United States</a>. Founded in 1809, it is the 10th oldest public university in the United States and the second oldest in Ohio. In its 2011 edition, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the university 79th overall and ranked its undergraduate teaching 2nd among national universities, tied with <a>Princeton University</a>. The land was located within the <a>Symmes Purchase</a>; Judge <a>John Cleves Symmes</a>, the owner of the land, purchased the land from the government with the stipulation that he lay aside land for an academy. Congress granted one township to be located in the District of Cincinnati to the <a>Ohio General Assembly</a> for the purposes of building a college, two days after <a>Ohio</a> was granted <a>statehood</a> in 1803; if no suitable location could be provided in the Symmes Purchase, Congress pledged to give federal lands to the legislature after a five-year period. The Ohio Legislature appointed three surveyors in August of the same year to search for a suitable township, and they selected a township off of Four Mile Creek.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p> Miami is a large, primarily residential research university with a focus on undergraduate studies. The full-time, four year undergraduate program offers 56 majors in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence. </p>

In order to enroll in graduate courses, students must first be accepted into The Graduate School, and then into the department through which the degree is offered.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Miami's <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I-A</a> program offers 18 <a>varsity sports</a> for men and women. The <a>RedHawks</a>, the name of Miami's collegiate sports teams, participates in the <a>Mid-American Conference</a> (MAC) in all varsity sports except ice hockey, which competes in the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>. Miami's athletic teams were originally called the Redskins up through 1997 when the <a>Oklahoma</a>-based <a>Miami tribe</a> withdrew its support for the nickname; the board of trustees voted to change the nickname to the RedHawks. The current athletic director is Brad Bates, who was promoted to the position in November 2002.</p>
<p>Miami University has never won a national title in any team sport, except in <a>synchronized skating</a> which is not an NCAA-recognized sport. The school has earned the nickname &quot;<a>Cradle of Coaches</a>&quot; for producing star football coaches.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> [[Image:muohiofootball.jpg|thumb|300 px|A football game at [[Yager Stadium (Miami University)|Yager Stadium]] ]]</p>
<p>Miami University has a rich history of <a>football</a>. Miami is known as the <a>Cradle of Coaches</a> for its quality football coaches that leave its program; <a>Ben Roethlisberger</a>, a quarterback from Miami, has gone onto be a two-time <a>Super Bowl</a> winning quarterback for the <a>Pittsburgh Steelers</a>.</p>
<p>Miami's football team plays in <a>Yager Stadium</a>, a 24,286-seat football stadium on campus; they formerly played in the now demolished <a>Miami Field</a>. The current coach is <a>Don Treadwell</a>, who was hired December 29, 2010.  The RedHawks compete each year against the <a>Cincinnati Bearcats</a> for the <a>Victory Bell</a>, a tradition that dates back to 1888.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Miami has appeared in sixteen <a>NCAA basketball championships</a> and have four <a>sweet sixteen</a> appearances, most recently in <a>1999</a>. The team competes in <a>Millett Hall</a> and is currently coached by <a>Charlie Coles</a>, who is in his 11th season and has a 224&#x2013;168 record at Miami.</p>
<h3>Men's ice hockey</h3>
<p> [[File:MiamiFansHockey.jpg|thumb|right|Miami fans gather before a hockey game against the [[UNO Mavericks|Nebraska-Omaha Mavericks]].]]</p>
<p>Miami's men's varsity <a>ice hockey</a> team started in 1978 coached by <a>Steve Cady</a>. The RedHawks made the <a>NCAA national title game</a> in 2009, but lost in overtime to <a>Boston University</a> after leading much of the game. Since the <a>Mid-American Conference</a> does not include Division I men's ice hockey, Miami competes in the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a> (CCHA). It is one of three schools from the MAC in the CCHA along with <a>Bowling Green State University</a> and <a>Western Michigan University</a>.</p>
<p>The men's ice hockey team plays at the <a>Goggin Ice Center</a>. The center contains two rinks: a practice rink, and <a>Steve Cady Arena</a>, which is used by the hockey team. The arena has a <a>seating capacity</a> of 3,200, and it replaced the <a>Goggin Ice Arena</a>.</p>
<h3>Synchronized skating</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Miami's <a>synchronized skating</a> team began in August 1977 as a &quot;Precision Skating Club&quot; at Goggin Ice Center. The program achieved varsity status by 1996. Miami won a silver medal at the 2007 World Championships, the first medal ever won by <a>Team USA</a> for synchronized skating. The collegiate level team has won eleven national titles; Miami created a junior-varsity level team beneath the senior level. All first- and second-year students are required to live on-campus and all dorms are three <a>stories</a> or less. Miami gives students the options of choosing from 35 theme-based living learning communities (LLCs); all of the halls on-campus participate in the LLC program. An LLC focuses on a certain theme, such as &quot;Governmental Relations&quot; or the &quot;Technology and Society Program&quot;, which allows students to live with people who have similar interests to themselves. The <a>Miami Triad</a> refers to the first three fraternities founded at Miami: Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, and Sigma Chi. The Triad is sometimes celebrated with parties at other universities such as the <a>University of Kansas</a>. As of Fall 2009, there are 2,036 sorority members and 1,492 fraternity members. This amounts to about a quarter of Miami's student population. Miami University's office of Greek affairs was endowed with a $1 million dollar gift from Cliff Alexander, a Miami University alumnus and a member of <a>Sigma Nu</a>; Miami believes this gift will support the Greek program well into the next century. Miami currently hosts about fifty different fraternities and sororities governed by three different student governing councils. Miami's fraternities and sororities hold many <a>philanthropy</a> events and community fundraisers.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The first issue of <em>The Miami Student</em></a> Miami University has over 400 student-run organizations. It has an <a>executive branch</a> run by a student president and a unicameral legislature in the student <a>senate</a>.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Miami has a variety of media outlets. The student-run newspaper, the <em>Miami Student</em>, was founded in 1826 and claims that it is the oldest university newspaper in the United States. RedHawk Radio is Miami's only student radio station. Miami University Television (MUTV) is available on cable in Oxford, Ohio.</p>
