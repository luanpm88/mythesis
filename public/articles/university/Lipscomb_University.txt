<p><strong>Lipscomb University</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al, <a>liberal arts</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Nashville, Tennessee</a>, <a>United States</a>. It is affiliated with the <a>Churches of Christ</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lipscomb University was founded in 1891 by <a>David Lipscomb</a> and <a>James A. Harding</a>. The campus grounds consist predominantly of the former estate of David Lipscomb, who donated it to the school. In the early 20th century, the institution was a <a>Bible college</a>.  Its original name was the <strong>Nashville Bible School</strong>, which was changed to <strong>David Lipscomb College</strong>, then to <strong>David Lipscomb University</strong>. Lipscomb graduated its first senior class in 1948, leaving behind the name of &quot;<a>junior college</a>&quot; forever. In 1954, the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted Lipscomb its first accreditation. In 1988, Lipscomb attained Level III (master's degree-granting) status and became known as David Lipscomb University. In 2005, the &quot;David&quot; was legally dropped, and the institution was renamed simply <strong>Lipscomb University.</strong></p>
<p>At the school's inception, all full-time students were required to take daily <a>Bible</a> classes and to attend daily chapel services; however, students are currently required to attend Bible classes three times a week and chapel twice a week. (Half of these chapels are now held in the <a>sport</a>s facility <a>Allen Arena</a>, and half are &quot;break-out&quot; sessions that are held in multiple places at once.)  The school was never intended to function primarily as a <a>seminary</a>, a term looked upon with disfavor by many members of the Churches of Christ, but rather as a <a>Christian</a> <a>liberal arts</a> institution. However, several prominent <a>Church of Christ</a> <a>religious ministers</a> received at least a portion of their <a>higher education</a> there (see &quot;Notable alumni&quot; below), and the institution remains thoroughly ensconced in the Churches of Christ: Potential faculty must prove their membership in a Church of Christ before being hired, and most of the student body comes from a Church of Christ family, background, or high school.</p>
<p>David Lipscomb was a <a>pacifist</a> who was highly skeptical about government, and although many people associated with Lipscomb University maintain this skepticism, most do not agree with Lipscomb's belief that Christians should not vote.</p>
<p>In addition to the university campus, there is also an on-campus <a>high school</a> and <a>middle school</a>; the associated <a>elementary school</a> moved to a renovated former <a>public school</a> a few blocks away in 1986.  All three comprise the <a>David Lipscomb Campus School</a>.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranks Lipscomb University 18th among Regional Universities (South) according to the U.S. News and World Report's &quot;2011 America's Best Colleges&quot; guidebook. Lipscomb's <a>liberal arts</a> curriculum includes a wide range of academic programs in the arts and sciences. Many students also enroll in pre-professional programs and go on to graduate school, with most students matriculating as majors in education, biblical studies, and business. The curriculum continues to evolve, notably with the addition of computer science in the Raymond B. Jones College of Engineering and the doctorate in pharmacy in the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The university has also increased its number of graduate programs, offering 15 degree programs. This is up from three degree programs only a few years ago. The university has also obtained a Level V status with the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> when it began seeking accreditation for the doctorate in pharmacy, allowing Lipscomb to expand its graduate offerings.</p>
<h2>Colleges and Institutes</h2>
<p>Lipscomb University comprises the following Colleges and Institutes: </p>
<h2>Campus Information</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Allen Bell Tower</a> <a>thumb|Bison Square</a> The campus is located in the <a>Green Hills</a> <a>suburb</a>s of Nashville between Belmont Boulevard to the west and Granny White Pike on the east.</p>
<p>The center of the university, known as Bison Square, is located between the Bennett Campus Center and the Willard Collins Alumni Auditorium. The south side of the Bennett Campus Center was converted from a single upstairs and downstairs entry into an amphitheater-style seating area and entryway, as well as having an entirely renovated interior with redesigned seating and lighting that create a more welcoming atmosphere. A full-service <a>Starbucks</a> store has also opened inside the campus center, complete with its own separate entry on both the interior and exterior of the building. The bricked square is traditionally used during warm weather as the location for devotionals, concerts, and other campus activities.</p>
<p>Willard Collins Alumni Auditorium has been completely renovated with new seating, flooring, and audio/video equipment, updating its look from the original design.  Attached to Alumni Auditorium is the A. M. Burton Health Sciences Center. The Burton building was heavily renovated to house the new College of Pharmacy. The entire renovation of the building received <a>LEED</a> Gold certification. On the southeast corner of Burton, a new music wing, the McMeen Music Center, with a large rehearsal room for music ensembles on the main level, with new music offices and practice rooms on the lower level.</p>
<p>To the south side of Burton is the Swang Business Center where business and English classes are held.</p>
<p>The university's newest academic building, the Hughes center, opened in Fall 2010 with space for both engineering and fine arts.  The Ezell Center comprises the religious, education, mass communication, social work, history, political science, and philosophy departments. Other academic buildings include the McFarland Hall of Sciences where the science and math classes are held, and the recently renovated Ward Hall with renovations similar to those in Alumni Auditorium.</p>
<p>Beaman Library was constructed in time for the university's centennial in 1991. The university's old library, the Crisman building, now serves as the university's administrative building.</p>
<p><a>Allen Arena</a>, a 5,028-seat multipurpose facility, opened in October 2001 on the site of the old McQuiddy Gymnasium. Part of the McQuiddy Gymnasium still remains between Allen Arena and the Student Activities Center (the SAC), a multi-purpose student activity space with workout facilities, basketball courts and an indoor track. The SAC offers a variety of workout classes to students, including spin classes on exercise bikes.  Yearwood Hall, a women's dormitory, was torn down for construction of Allen Arena and its accompanying parking garage.</p>
<p>The university has six residence halls. Women's residences include Elam Hall, Fanning Hall, and Johnson Hall, all of which have a large enclosed courtyard. Men's residences include Sewell Hall, which was renovated in the late 1990s, and the eight-story High Rise, the university's tallest structure. The final residence on campus is The Village, a co-ed, apartment style housing for upper classmen. Men and women are not allowed in dorms belonging to the opposite sex, with a few exceptions: 1) members of both sexes can enter the lobby during certain hours, 2) during moving days, and 3) on &quot;open dorm&quot; occasions; 4) and men are also allowed into the central courtyard of the women's dormitories only when cookouts or other such mixers are being held.</p>
<h2>Tax Exempt Bonds</h2>
<p>Some academic buildings were built with tax-exempt municipal bonds, and, because Lipscomb is a Christian school, this led to an extended lawsuit on the basis of whether or not a private religious institutions is allowed to use public bonds. This case was debated for many years and ultimately made it to the <a>Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>The court upheld the decision of the lower court, that, plainly stated, the government could not withhold public bonds based on Lipscomb's religious affiliation. However, one of the stipulations for receiving public funding was that these buildings cannot have religious classes taught in them. For example, no Bible classes are taught in the McFarland Hall of Sciences; however, the rule about excluding Bible classes does not apply to Ward Hall, even though it is attached to McFarland Hall. Construction of Ward was funded through private donations. This decision has allowed other private, religious universities to pursue public funding for capital projects.</p>
<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Lipscomb's student newspaper, <em>The Babbler</em>, is published weekly during the academic school year.</a> Lipscomb does not have <a>fraternities and sororities</a> per se. Rather, it has social clubs, which are local and unique to Lipscomb University and are not part of any national Greek system. The women's social clubs include Delta Xi, Delta Sigma, Delta Omega, Gamma Lambda, Kappa Chi, Phi Sigma, and Pi Delta. The men's social clubs are Delta Nu, Delta Tau, Gamma Xi, Sigma Omega Sigma, Sigma Iota Delta, and Tau Phi.</p>
<p>Students participate in Singarama (an annual spring musical variety show), as well as other entertainment, social, and service activities throughout the year. The university also offers membership in other academic, professional, and service clubs including <a>Alpha Kappa Psi</a> International Business Fraternity (Delta Kappa chapter), Sigma Alpha Iota women's music fraternity, Alpha Phi Chi men's service club, Pi Kappa Sigma women's service club, Sigma Pi Beta co-ed service club, <a>Alpha Chi</a> National Honors Society, <a>Sigma Tau Delta</a> National English <a>honor society</a>, Circle K International, <a>College Republicans</a>, and <a>College Democrats</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Babbler</em> is the defunct student newspaper and was published weekly during the spring and fall semesters. The title of the publication comes from <a>Acts</a> 17:18 which in part says &quot;What does this babbler have to say?&quot; <em>The Backlog</em> is the school's yearbook and is published annually. The LUmination Network, the school's new converged student media outlet, replaces the weekly Babbler and is tied heavily with the academic program of the Department of Communication and Journalism.</p>
<h2>Global Learning</h2>
<p>Lipscomb offers a handful of study abroad programs, which the university terms global learning. In the mid 1990s a semester-long, study abroad program in <a>Vienna</a>, <a>Austria</a>, was first offered, and is the flagship trip for the university. Several academic departments take short trips to various sites around the world. These trips are usually for fewer than 10 hours credit and a shorter time abroad. The university also partners with the <a>Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a> to offer other trips ranging from 10 days to semester long.</p>
<p>The University has several students active in the &quot;Students for International Peace and Justice,&quot; and the faculty began the Center for International Peace and Justice &quot;to promote awareness and understanding of international affairs, particularly as they relate to questions of peace, security and justice.&quot;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Lipscomb Bisons logo</a> Sports teams are <a>nickname</a>d &quot;The Bisons,&quot; and there is a large statue of the <a>namesake animal</a> centrally located on the campus. At one time the school was a small-college sports powerhouse, notably in <a>baseball</a> and <a>basketball</a> in the <a>NAIA</a>; now it is a new member of <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> and competes in the <a>Atlantic Sun Conference</a>.</p>
<p>The university has an ongoing sports rivalry with <a>Belmont University</a>, just  down the road from Lipscomb. Traditionally basketball games between the two schools are called the <a>Battle of the Boulevard</a>, which Lipscomb swept 2-0 in 2007. Overall the Bisons have the series advantage 70-55.</p>
<p>In 2006, the rivalry reached a new level when Belmont and Lipscomb advanced to the finals of the Atlantic Sun tournament at the <a>Memorial Center</a> in <a>Johnson City, Tennessee</a>, with the winner earning its first-ever bid to the <a>NCAA tournament</a>. Belmont won 74-69 in overtime. Lipscomb was invited to the <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> as the regular-season conference champion, losing in its first game.</p>
<p>The Lipscomb Bisons traditionally include the &quot;s&quot;, though the plural of &quot;bison&quot; is usually not &quot;bisons.&quot; However, some dictionaries list this as a rare usage (and the <a>Oxford English Dictionary</a> points out that in <a>Latin</a> the plural is &quot;bisontes&quot;).</p>
<p>The Bison serves as the official <a>mascot</a> of Lipscomb University. The Bison can be seen at basketball, baseball, volleyball games, and other non-athletic activities around the Lipscomb campus. The Bison returned in the fall semester of the '05/'06 season, to continue his career as Lipscomb's mascot.</p>
<p>On November 13, 2007, the Lipscomb women's basketball team defeated <a>Fisk University</a> 123-22 in one of the most lopsided games in NCAA history.</p>
<p>On Sat. May 15, 2010, the Lipscomb men's track and field team defeated <a>Belmont University</a> for the first time in Lipscomb's history.  Also Ryan Chastain won the 15,000m race receiving another conference title for Lipscomb Athletics.</p>
