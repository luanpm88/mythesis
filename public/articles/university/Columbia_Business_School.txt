<p></p>
<p><strong>Columbia Business School</strong> (<strong>CBS</strong>) is the <a>business school</a> of <a>Columbia University</a> in <a>Manhattan</a>, <a>New York City</a>. It was established in 1916 to provide business training and professional preparation for undergraduate and graduate Columbia University students. It is one of six <a>Ivy League business schools</a> and its admission process is among the most selective of top business schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Columbia Business School is known for its close ties to <a>Wall Street</a> and the seminal work completed in the field of <a>Finance</a> by professors <a>Benjamin Graham</a> and <a>David Dodd</a>.  It is affiliated with 13 winners of the <a>Nobel Prize in Economics</a> including current professors <a>Robert Mundell</a>, <a>Joseph Stiglitz</a> and <a>Edmund Phelps</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The school has an international emphasis, and many alumni have achieved distinction in the public as well as the private sector.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:Butler Library - 1000px - AC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Butler Library]]]]</p>
<p><a>A. Barton Hepburn</a>, then president of <a>Chase Manhattan Bank</a>, founded the School in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an opening class of 61 students, including 8 women. The School expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920 and in 1924, added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.</p>
<p>In 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the <a>Master of Business Administration</a> degree (MBA). Shortly thereafter, the School adopted the <a>Hermes</a> emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce and communication.</p>

<p>In 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a <a>Certificate in Business Excellence</a> (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees.  In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the <a>London Business School</a>), the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program (launched in 2002 in conjunction with the <a>Haas School of Business</a> at <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>), and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launching in 2009 in conjunction with the <a>London Business School</a> and the <a>University of Hong Kong Business School</a>). Students in jointly run programs earn an MBA degree from each of the cooperating institutions.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2004, <a>R. Glenn Hubbard</a> became Columbia Business School's eleventh dean. Hubbard, the former chair of President Bush's <a>Council of Economic Advisers</a>, has worked at the intersection of the private, government and nonprofit sectors and has been actively engaged in national and international economic policy issues</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[File:Urishall.JPEG|thumb|right|Uris Hall, standing behind [[Clement Meadmore]]'s 1968 sculpture &quot;The Curl&quot;]]</p>
<p>Today, Columbia Business School is primarily housed in Uris Hall, a recently renovated 1960s structure at the center of Columbia's <a>Morningside Heights</a> campus. An auxiliary space, Warren Hall, is situated on <a>Amsterdam Avenue</a> and is shared with the <a>law school</a>. By 2015, the school will be moved to a new, more spacious facility at Columbia's planned new campus on <a>125th Street</a> in <a>Manhattanville</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In October 2010, Columbia Business School announced that alumnus <a>Henry Kravis</a>, the billionaire co-founder of private-equity firm <a>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</a> (KKR &amp; Co.), pledged $100 million to fund expansion of Columbia Business School, the largest gift in its history. The donation will go toward construction of the business school&#x2019;s new site in the <a>Manhattanville</a> section of <a>New York City</a>, where Columbia University is extending its campus. One of the school&#x2019;s two new buildings will be named for Kravis.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Full Time MBA Program</h2>
<p>The <a>Columbia MBA Program</a> is designed to prepare its students for the challenges they will face as emerging leaders in a rapidly changing business world.  The admission process is highly competitive with an admission rate of 15% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The student body is highly accomplished and diverse.  Students in the class that entered in 2009 come from 61 countries and speak more than 50 languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia Business School&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>The revised <a>core curriculum</a>, launched in the fall of 2008, represents about 40% of the degree requirement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 2 full courses and 12 half-term courses including Corporate Finance, Financial Accounting, Managerial Statistics, Managerial Economics, Leadership, Operations Management, and Marketing Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the first year of the program is usually devoted to completing the requirements of the <a>core curriculum</a>, the second year provides students with the opportunity to choose from the more than 130 elective courses available at the School and supplement them with more than 4,000 graduate-level classes from the University's other graduate and professional schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular electives at Columbia Business School are the Economics of Strategic Behavior, Financial Statement Analysis and Earnings Quality, Launching New Ventures, Modern Political Economy, and the Seminar in Value Investing.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Students enter Columbia's MBA program in two tracks.  The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term &quot;J-Term&quot; is approximately 200 students.  Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters.  The J-Term is aimed at students who want an accelerated 18 month program who usually plan to return to their previous job, are company sponsored, and will not pursue a summer internship because they take classes during the summer.</p>
<p>The recently launched <a>Columbia CaseWorks</a> program utilizes the faculty&#x2019;s research and industry experience and brings that perspective into the classroom through the development of new cases and teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in orientation and continuing through core classes and electives, students are immersed in cases that use faculty research to address real-world business issues. <a>Columbia CaseWorks</a> challenges students to debate corporate decision making and to develop appropriate recommendations and solutions.</p>
<p>In 2009, the median starting base salary was $100,000 with a median $20,000 signing bonus and a median $24,000 of other guaranteed compensation.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Columbia Business School Employment Report &#x2013; 2009</a>.&lt;/ref&gt; According to <em><a>Forbes</a></em> magazine, 90% of billionaires with MBAs who derived their fortunes from finance obtained their master's degree from one of three schools: <a>Harvard Business School</a>, Columbia Business School, or <a>The Wharton School</a> at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Forbes: Billionaire Clusters</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Areas of focus</h3>
<p>[[File:Columbia University 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Low Memorial Library]]]]</p>
<p>Many students choose to focus on a particular area in order to gain deeper knowledge in a specific discipline. Columbia Business School offers the following areas of focus:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Accounting</a></li>
  <li><a>Decision, Risk and Operations</a></li>
  <li><a>Entrepreneurship</a></li>
  <li><a>Finance and Economics</a></li>
  <li><a>Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management</a></li>
  <li><a>Human Resource Management</a></li>
  <li><a>International Business</a></li>
  <li><a>Management / Leadership</a></li>
  <li><a>Marketing</a></li>
  <li><a>Media</a></li>
  <li><a>Private Equity</a></li>
  <li><a>Real Estate</a></li>
  <li><a>Social Enterprise</a></li>
  <li><a>Value Investing</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Value Investing Program</h3>
<p>As part of its <a>MBA curriculum</a>, Columbia Business School offers the Value Investing Program at the prestigious <a>Heilbrunn Center for Graham &amp; Dodd Investing</a>, for a handful of selected business school students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The program includes Applied Value Investing and Special Situations Investing. Adjunct professors include hedge fund managers, such as <a>Joel Greenblatt</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Paul Sonkin</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>William Von Mueffling</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The program also features an extensive list of guest speakers which include <a>Seth Klarman</a>, <a>Michael Price</a>, <a>Bill Nygren</a>, <a>Charles Brandes</a> and <a>Chris Browne</a>. Notable graduates of the <a>value investing</a> program include <a>Warren Buffett</a>, <a>Mario Gabelli</a>, <a>Leon G. Cooperman</a>, <a>Chuck Royce</a>, <a>Paul Sonkin</a> and <a>William von Mueffling</a>.</p>
<h3>Entrepreneurship Program</h3>
<p>Columbia Business School's <a>Entrepreneurship Program</a> strives to provide students with the skills required for venturing and providing opportunities for them to start an entrepreneurial career in four career paths: entrepreneurship in new ventures, entrepreneurship in large organizations, private equity financing and social entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, entrepreneurship among Columbia MBA students is on the rise, with 20 students in the MBA Class of 2007 starting their own businesses directly after graduation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia Business School&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2>Executive MBA Program</h2>
<p>Columbia Business School's <a>Executive MBA (EMBA) Program</a> is a 20-month graduate program designed specifically for businesspeople that are looking to enhance their education without interrupting their careers.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year. </p>
<p>In addition to the New York&#x2013;based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>EMBA-Global</a> program started in 2001. It is a 20-month program administered in partnership with the <a>London Business School</a>. The program enrolls approximately 70 students from around the world per year. Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools. During the first year, the core curriculum classes alternate monthly between the campuses of Columbia University and the London Business School. The core curriculum is similar to that offered in the regular EMBA programs offered separately by each school, but with a more transnational-business emphasis. Second year classes may be selected from the portfolio of EMBA classes offered at either or both partner schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The second partner program is the <a>Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA</a>, administered in conjunction with the <a>Haas School of Business</a> at the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>. This 19-month program enrolls approximately 70 students per year. Classes are divided into five terms. Each term contains five sessions that typically meet Thursday through Saturday. One session per term is held at the Columbia University campus, the other four are held on campus at the Haas School of Business. Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools. The core curriculum is taught during the first three terms and consists of material similar to that given in the other EMBA programs. The last two terms offer elective courses. Students may opt to spend one term studying exclusively in the NY-EMBA program at Columbia or in the other MBA programs offered at Berkeley.</p>
<p>The third partner program is <a>EMBA-Global Asia</a>, run jointly with the <a>London Business School</a> and the <a>University of Hong Kong</a>. This 20-month program follows a curriculum similar to the EMBA-Global program. Classes are held in Hong Kong, London, New York, and Shanghai. The inaugural class starts in May, 2009.</p>
<p>Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.</p>
<h2>Executive Education</h2>
<p>Columbia Business School's Executive Education programs offer graduate Executive Certificate Programs such as the <a>Columbia Senior Executive Program</a> (CSEP),&lt;ref name=&quot;CSEP Program&quot;&gt;[<a>http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/programs/detail/10407/Columbia+Senior+Executive+Program</a>&quot;CSEP Program Details&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Columbia <a>Certificate in Business Excellence</a> (CIBE).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIBE Program&quot;&gt;[<a>http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/certificate</a>&quot;CIBE Program Details&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional programs and courses are offered in General Management, Leadership, Finance and essential business practices.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed</a>&quot;Columbia Executive Education&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Doctoral Program</h2>
<p>The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is offered by the <a>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</a> and is administered by the Business School.  Admission is highly competitive with 894 applicants in 2010 for positions in an entering class of 18 students (2%).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A <a>PhD in Management</a> or Business is a common precursor to an academic career in business schools.</p>
<p>Throughout the program, students become familiar with research methods and the literature of their major fields through research projects and directed reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsb.columbia.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Doctoral candidates begin the program mastering basic research tools by studying subjects such as economics, behavioral science and quantitative methods, in addition to completing course work and examinations in the major field of study. The completion of course work and qualifying examinations normally requires two to three years.</p>
<p>The research phase begins as early as the first year, when students serve as research assistants, and continues throughout their time at the School.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsb.columbia.edu&quot;/&gt; Students gradually become more involved in the design and execution of research and, by the end of the second year, have typically produced at least one paper suitable for publication, often as coauthor with a faculty member. The later years of the program are dedicated to original research and the creation of the dissertation. </p>
<p>Recent <a>Columbia PhD</a> placements include the following:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Harvard Business School</a></li>
  <li><a>Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</a></li>
  <li><a>London Business School</a></li>

<h3>Follies</h3>
<p>The <a>Columbia Business School Follies</a> is a student club that works throughout each semester to put together a production in which students write, choreograph, and perform <a>comedy skits</a>. It achieved notoriety in 2006&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for <a>Every Breath Bernanke Takes</a>, its video parody of the <a>Police</a> song &quot;<a>Every Breath You Take</a>&quot;. It purports to be from <a>Glenn Hubbard</a>, Dean of the Business School, in response to Hubbard's being a runner-up to the <a>Fed Chairmanship</a> assumed by <a>Ben Bernanke</a>. In 2008,  the Follies team released a sequel to this video called &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;<a>The Market Crashed On Me</a>&quot;, a parody of the <a>Boyz II Men</a> song <a>On Bended Knee</a>. The Follies' other notable video parodies include <a>Damn It Feels Good To Be A Banka</a>, <a>B-School Guy vs. Law School Guy</a>, <a>Baby Got WACC</a>, and <a>MRS</a>.</p>
