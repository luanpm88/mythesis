<p> The <strong>University of Richmond</strong> is a selective, <a>private</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, <a>liberal arts</a> <a>university</a> located on the border of the city of <a>Richmond</a> and <a>Henrico County</a>, <a>Virginia</a>. The University of Richmond (UR or U of R) is a primarily undergraduate, residential university with approximately 4,000  undergraduate and graduate students in five schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the <a>E. Claiborne Robins School of Business</a>, the <a>Jepson School of Leadership Studies</a>, the <a>T.C. Williams School of Law</a> and the <a>School of Continuing Studies</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded by Virginia <a>Baptists</a> in 1830 as a <a>seminary</a> for men, with instruction begun by the Rev. Edward Baptist, the school was incorporated ten years later as <strong>Richmond College</strong>.  During the <a>American Civil War</a>, Richmond College was used as a hospital for <a>Confederate</a> troops and later as a <a>Union</a> <a>barracks</a>. By the end of the war, the college was bankrupt and unable to continue functioning.  In 1866, James Thomas donated $5,000 to reopen the college.  The T.C. Williams School of Law opened in 1870.  </p>
<p>In 1894, the college elected Dr. <a>Frederic W. Boatwright</a> president.  President Boatwright would serve for 51 years.  He is most remembered for his decision to move the college in 1914 from its original location in what is now the <a>Fan district</a> to its current location in the <a>Westhampton</a> area of Richmond.  The university's main library, Boatwright Memorial Library, is named in Boatwright's honor.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Looking out over Westhampton Lake from Tyler Haynes Commons</a> In conjunction with the move, a new college for women, Westhampton College, opened on the new campus. In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, followed by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962. In 1969, E. Claiborne Robins, a <a>trustee</a> and <a>alumnus</a>, donated $50 million to the university, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time. Today, the university's endowment totals approximately $1.4 billion and ranked 32nd among North American university endowments for fiscal year 2009. The school, which opened in 1992, was the first of its kind in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 1990, the missions of Richmond and Westhampton Colleges were combined to form the School of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1992, candidates <a>George H. W. Bush</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, and <a>Ross Perot</a> came to campus for the first-ever &quot;town hall&quot; televised presidential debate, viewed by 200 million people worldwide.</p>
<p><a>Edward L. Ayers</a>, former dean of the <a>College of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> at the <a>University of Virginia</a>, is the current president of the University of Richmond.  Dr. Ayers was named the ninth president of the University of Richmond on November 10, 2006.  He took office on July 1, 2007.</p>
<h2>Schools</h2>
<h3>School of Arts &amp; Sciences</h3>
<p>All Richmond undergraduate students begin their course work in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences (A&amp;S), which offers 38 majors and 10 concentrations in the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  After one full year of study, students may decide to pursue majors in the other undergraduate schools, though 70 percent of students choose to remain in A&amp;S.</p>
<p>Opportunities abound in the School of Art &amp; Sciences, as students have the chance to study abroad and pursue internships or research while gaining an education that will prepare them for a variety of careers or graduate programs.</p>
<h3>Robins School of Business</h3>
<p> The Robins School of Business was established in 1949 and offers undergraduate, graduate and executive education programs. It is named after alumnus E. Claiborne Robins.</p>
<p>Ranked 12th nationally overall and tied for first in academic quality by <em>BusinessWeek</em>, the Robins School is the only fully accredited, top-ranked undergraduate business school that also is part of a top-ranked liberal arts university.  In the 2009 <em>BusinessWeek</em> review of part-time MBA programs, the Robins school ranked 3rd in the mid-Atlantic region and 17th nationwide.</p>
<h3>Jepson School of Leadership Studies</h3>
<p> The Jepson School of <a>Leadership Studies</a> was founded to address a perceived need in the modern world for the academic study of leadership. The school blends a curriculum of economics, history, literature, philosophy, politics, psychology and religion so that students can learn conceptual tools that support the exercise of leadership in varied settings. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|250px|left|A view of the Robins School of Business from the T.C. Williams School of Law</a> --&gt;</p>
<h3>T.C. Williams School of Law</h3>
<p> Chartered in 1840, Richmond College was only 30 years old when it added a Law Department. The initial years were very successful for the new Law Department but during the difficult financial times that followed the Civil War, legal education was intermittent at Richmond College until 1890. In that year, the family of the late T.C. Williams, Sr., endowed a Professorship of Law, thus assuring the continuous teaching of law at Richmond College. The Law School was granted membership in the Association of American Law Schools in 1930 and now enrolls approximately 500 full-time students and has 4,300 active alumni.</p>
<h3>School of Continuing Studies</h3>
<p>The School of Continuing Studies offers degree and certificate programs, enrichment opportunities, professional training, and college course work for part-time and non-traditional students of all ages. A variety of evening programs with credit and non-credit courses make it possible for those with busy schedules to further their education or explore new interests.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate Academics</h2>

These requirements include the Core Course, a two-semester course heavily focused on international writings and philosophy that first-year students must complete. Other general education requirements include expository writing, wellness, foreign language, and one class each in six fields of study.</p>
<p>Richmond offers more than 100 majors, minors, and concentrations in three undergraduate schools &mdash; the School of Arts and Sciences, the  Robins School of Business, and the Jepson School of Leadership Studies. The School of Continuing Studies, primarily an evening school focused on part-time adult students, offers additional degree programs in selected areas.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The University of Richmond's campus consists of  in a suburban setting on the western edge of the city.  The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus &mdash; red brick buildings in a <a>collegiate gothic</a> style set around shared open lawns.  Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a> in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Cornell</a>, <a>Rice</a>, and <a>Williams</a>, among other universities.  <a>Warren H. Manning</a>, a former apprentice to <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, designed the original landscape plan.  The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil. In 2000, the campus was recognized by <a>The Princeton Review</a> as the most beautiful in the United States.</p>
<p>The University of Richmond campus was used to film portions of the pilot of <em><a>Commander in Chief</a></em>, and lead character <a>Mackenzie Allen</a>, (played by <a>Geena Davis</a>) served as <a>chancellor</a> of a fictionalized University of Richmond prior to her election as <a>Vice President of the United States</a>. Much of the movie <em><a>Cry_Wolf</a></em> was filmed on the Westhampton side of campus, with several dormitories, including South Court, North Court, and Keller Hall, serving as locations. Several episodes of the television show <em><a>Dawson's Creek</a></em> were also filmed on campus, referring to Richmond only as a nameless &quot;beautiful Ivy League campus.&quot; The filming itself took place in Stern Quad and inside the Jepson Alumni Center.</p>
<p>The University of Richmond also owns the former <a>Reynolds Metals Executive Office Building</a>, purchased from <a>Alcoa</a> in 2001.  Located a few miles from campus, the  building was designed by architect <a>Gordon Bunshaft</a> and opened in 1958.  The building, which incorporates nearly 1.4 million pounds of <a>aluminum</a>, is listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.  It currently serves as the headquarters of <a>Altria Group</a> and its subsidiary, <a>Philip Morris USA</a>, which are leasing it from the university.  In early 2001, the university also finalized the purchase of  of land in eastern <a>Goochland County</a>, a few miles from the main campus.  The land is currently used for biology research, but future uses could include intramural athletic fields.</p>
<p>The University of Richmond campus is also home to the <a>Virginia Governor's School for Visual and Performing Arts and Humanities</a> during the summer.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> The University won its <a>first NCAA national championship</a> in any sport on December 19, 2008 when the Spiders football team defeated the <a>Montana Grizzlies</a>, 24-7, in the <a>NCAA Division I Football Championship</a>.  Richmond was ranked 23rd in men's basketball at one point during the 2009-10 season.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>Within the past year, the University of Richmond has undergone various, large-scale construction projects to update and enlarge its campus.  In addition to yearly renovations of the on-campus residence halls, projects now in construction include the E. Claiborne Robins Stadium [<a>http://construction.richmond.edu/stadium/index.html</a>], the Queally Hall [<a>http://construction.richmond.edu/queally-hall/index.html</a>] addition to the Robins School of Business, and the Carole Weinstein International Center [<a>http://construction.richmond.edu/international-center/index.html</a>]. The Westhampton Center [<a>http://construction.richmond.edu/westhampton-center/index.html</a>] was completed in the Fall of 2009.</p>
