<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p> What is now San Jose State University was originally established in 1857 as the <a>Minns' Evening Normal School</a> in San Francisco. The school was founded by <a>George W. Minns</a>. </p>
<p>[[Image:California-State-Normal-300.jpg|250px|thumb|left|An 1880s lithograph of the original [[California State Normal School]] campus in San Jose.]] In 1862, by act of the <a>California legislature</a>, Minns' Evening Normal School became the <a>California State Normal School</a> and graduated 54 women from a three-year program. A large bell was forged that year to commemorate the original California State Normal School location in San Jose. The bell was inscribed with the words &quot;California State Normal School, A.D. 1881,&quot; and was rung on special occasions until 1946 when the college obtained new chimes. The original bell appears on the SJSU campus to this day, and is still associated with various student traditions and rituals. </p>
<p>In 1921, the school's name changed to the State Teachers College at San Jose. In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges became the California State Colleges, and the school's name was changed again, this time to San Jose State College. In 1972, upon meeting criteria established by the Board of Trustees and the Coordinating Council for Higher Education, SJSC was granted university status, and the name was changed to California State University, San Jose. </p>
<p>Finally, in 1974, the California legislature voted to change the school's name to San Jose State University.</li>
  <li>In 1942, the old gym (now named Yoshihiro Uchida Hall, after SJSU judo coach <a>Yosh Uchida</a>) was used to register and collect Japanese Americans before sending them to internment camps. Coincidentally, Uchida's parents and siblings were among those processed in the building.</li>
  <li>In 1963, in an effort to save Tower Hall from demolition, SJSU students and alumni organized testimonials before the State College Board of Trustees, sent telegrams, and provided signed petitions. As a result of those efforts, the Tower, a prime campus landmark and SJSU icon, was refurbished and reopened in 1966. The Tower was again renovated and restored in 2007. Tower Hall is registered with the California Office of Historic Preservation.</li>
  <li>During the 1960s and early 1970s, San Jose State College witnessed a rise in political activism and civic awareness among its student body, including major student protests against the <a>Vietnam War</a>. One of the largest campus protests took place in 1967 when <a>Dow Chemical Company</a> - a major manufacturer of <a>napalm</a> used in the war - came to campus to conduct job recruiting. An estimated 3,000 students and bystanders surrounded the Seventh Street Administration building, and more than 200 students and teachers lay down on the ground in front of the recruiters.</li>
  <li>In 1972&#x2013;1973, the economics department experienced political turmoil as the administration conducted a purge of left-leaning professors. For several years thereafter, the economics department was under censor by the American Association of University Professors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since 1982, the English department has sponsored the annual <a>Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest</a>.</li>
  <li>In 1999, San Jose State and the City of San Jose agreed to combine their main libraries to form a joint city/university library located on campus, the first known collaboration of this type in the United States. The combined library faced opposition, with critics stating the two libraries have very different objectives and that the project would be too expensive. Despite opposition, the project proceeded, and the new Martin Luther King, Jr. Library opened on-time and on-budget in 2003. The new library has won several national awards since its initial opening in 2003.</li>
  <li>In 2006, the SJSU College of Business received a US$10 million donation from alumni Donald and Sally Lucas. The Lucas donation was listed among the largest philanthropic gifts in the state of California in 2006 by the <a>Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>, and amounted to the largest single monetary gift to SJSU in school history.</li>
  <li>During its 2006-2007 fiscal year, SJSU received a record US$50+ million in private gifts and US$84 million in capital campaign contributions.</li>
  <li>In March 2007, a group of San Jose State students sponsored an official student initiative to restore the words &quot;California State University&quot; to the school's official public identity while preserving the &quot;SJSU&quot; city-state name. Although the measure was defeated, it garnered substantial Bay Area media coverage. Some 600 students voted in favor of the measure, amounting to roughly 25% of the students casting ballots in the election.</li>
  <li>In 2007, SJSU alumna Connie Lurie donated US$10 million to the College of Education. The donation was the largest individual gift ever given to a college of education in the history of the California State University system. The name of the college was later changed to the Connie L. Lurie College of Education.</li>
  <li>In 2007, SJSU alumnus Charles W. Davidson donated US$15 million to the College of Engineering. It was the single largest private gift to SJSU in the history of the university, and tied for the largest individual gift ever received by the California State University System. Accordingly, the name of the college was changed to the Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering. </li>
  <li>In 2008, SJSU received a <a>CASE</a> WealthEngine Award in recognition of raising over US$100 million. SJSU was one of approximately 50 institutions nationwide honored by CASE in 2008 for overall performance in educational fundraising.</li>
  <li>In 2008, then SJSU president Don Kassing enacted a controversial decision to ban blood drives on campus due to the FDA's long-standing policy barring gay men from donating blood. Kassing reasoned the FDA policy stood in violation of SJSU's non-discrimination policy.  &quot;I recognize the importance of giving blood and we know that universities are a significant source of blood,&quot; he wrote in an E-mail sent to faculty, staff, students, and alumni. &quot;Our hope is that the FDA will revisit its deferral policy in a timely manner, and we may soon be able to hold blood drives on this campus again.&quot;  Kassing's decision was reportedly born out of a grievance filed by university employee Seth Hodge. The story was widely reported in the national media.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>250px|thumb|left|A view of the SJSU campus from King Library. The top of Tower Hall appears in the foreground. Campus Village appears in the background.</a></p>
<p>The SJSU main <a>campus</a> comprises approximately 55 buildings situated on a rectangular,  area in downtown San Jose. The campus is bordered by San Fernando Street to the north, San Salvador Street to the south, South 4th Street to the west, and South 10th Street to the east. The South Campus, which is home to many of the school's athletics facilities, is located approximately  south of the main campus on South 7th Street.</p>
<p>California State Normal School did not receive a permanent home until it moved from San Francisco to San Jose in 1871. The original California State Normal School campus in San Jose consisted of several rectangular, wooden buildings with a central grass quadrangle. The wooden buildings were destroyed by fire in 1880 and were replaced by interconnected stone and masonry structures of roughly the same configuration in 1881. These buildings were declared unsafe following the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and were being torn down when an <a>aftershock</a> of the magnitude that was predicted to destroy the buildings occurred and no damage was observed. Accordingly, demolition was stopped, and the portions of the buildings still standing were made into four halls: Tower Hall, Morris Dailey Auditorium, Washington Square Hall, and Dwight Bentel Hall. These four structures remain standing to this day, and are the oldest buildings on campus. </p>
<p>Beginning in the fall of 1994, the on-campus segments of San Carlos Street, Seventh Street and Ninth Street were closed to automobile traffic and converted to pedestrian walkways and green belts within the campus. San Carlos Street was renamed Paseo San Carlos, Seventh Street became El Paseo de <a>C&#x00e9;sar Ch&#x00e1;vez</a>, and Ninth Street is now called the Ninth Street Plaza. The project was completed in 1996.</p>
<p>Completed in 1999, the Business Classroom Project was a US$16 million renovation of the James F. Boccardo Business Education Center. </p>

<p>Completed in 1999, the US$1.5 million Heritage Gateway project was unveiled. The privately-funded project featured construction of eight oversized gateways around the main campus perimeter.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2000, the SJSU Police Department, which is part of the larger <a>California State University Police Department</a>, opened a new on-campus, multi-level facility on 7th Street.</p>
<p>The new US$177 million <a>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library</a>, which opened its doors on August 1, 2003, won the <a>Library Journal's</a> prestigious 2004 Library of the Year award, the publication&#x2019;s highest honor. The King Library represents the first collaboration of its kind between a university and a major U.S. city. The library is eight stories high, has  of floor space, and houses approximately 1.6 million volumes. San Jose's first public library occupied the same site from 1901 to 1936, and SJSU's Wahlquist Library occupied the site from 1961 to 2000, at which point it was torn down to begin construction of the King Library.</p>
<p>In 2002, three of SJSU's six red brick residence halls were demolished and replaced with the new Campus Village residence complex. The US$200 million housing facility comprises three buildings ranging from seven to 15 stories tall. The project increased student capacity for on-campus housing to roughly 3,500, and provides housing options for first-year students, upper-class students, graduate students and faculty, staff and guests of the university. Campus Village officially opened in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2006, a US$2 million renovation of Tower Hall was completed. Tower Hall is the oldest and most recognizable building on campus.</p>
<h3>Additional on-campus facilities</h3>
<p>In 2007, the School of Library and Information Science opened a <a>virtual campus</a> in <a>Second Life</a>, complete with faculty offices, classrooms, student lounge and library e-resources. The project was supported by grants from a number of sources including the <a>Soros Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>SJSU is home to the , three-story Nuclear Science Facility. It is the only nuclear science facility of its kind in the California State University system.</p>
<p>Located on the main campus, the SJSU Aquatic Center features an outdoor <a>Olympic-size swimming pool</a>. The pool is open year-round and is believed to be among the largest outdoor pools in California. </p>
<p>Located on the main campus, <a>The Event Center Arena</a> seats approximately 5,000 people for athletic events and over 6,000 for concerts, and features an attached recreation center that includes a basketball practice gym, racquetball courts, a weight room and a climbing wall. </p>
<p>The SJSU Student Union is a four-story, stand alone facility that features a food court, the Spartan Bookstore, a multi-level study area, ballrooms, a bowling alley, music room, and a large game room. In June 2010, a US$91 million renovation and expansion project of the SJSU Student Union commenced. The project is expected to take about 30 months to complete, with the new facility opening its doors sometime in 2013. </p>
<p>In May 2011, construction of a new student health and counseling facility is scheduled to commence. The project will cost an estimated US$33 million, and is scheduled to be completed in May of 2013.</p>
<h3>South Campus</h3>
<p>Many of SJSU's athletics facilities, including <a>Spartan Stadium</a> and Blethen Field (baseball), along with the athletics department administrative offices and multiple training and practice facilities, are located on the  South Campus approximately  south of the main campus near 7th Street.

<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>Admission to SJSU is based on a combination of the applicant's high school cumulative <a>grade point average</a> (GPA) and standardized test scores. These factors are used to determine the applicant's California State University (CSU) eligibility index. More specifically, the eligibility index is a weighted combination of high school grade point average during the final three years of high school and a score on either the <a>SAT</a> or <a>ACT</a>. As of 2008, the average SAT score for incoming freshmen was 1,004, and the average high school GPA for incoming freshmen was 3.21.</p>
<p>SJSU currently requires a minimum eligibility index of 2900-3200 using the SAT or 694-760 using the ACT depending on the selected major (3502 and 842 respectively for non-residents of California), which is slightly above the CSU minimum of 2900 and 694 respectively.</p>
<p>The CSU eligibility index is calculated by using either the SAT or ACT as follows:</p>
<p>::<em>(SAT scores in mathematics and critical reading) + (800 x GPA) <strong>or</strong> (10 x ACT composite score without the writing score) + (200 x GPA)</em></p>
<p>The university recently formed a cross-enrollment agreement with <a>National Hispanic University</a>. Students enrolled at one institution are able to enroll in up to 6 credits per semester at the other institution. Additionally, students may transfer between institutions with up to 60 credits.</p>
