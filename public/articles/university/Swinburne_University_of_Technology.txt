<h2>Teaching style</h2>
<p>From 2006 to 2009, Swinburne was recognised by the Federal Government for teaching excellence in the Learning and Teaching Performance Fund (LTPF) which rewards universities for outstanding performance. Swinburne was one of only nine universities to have been rewarded for excellence in all four rounds of the LTPF. Swinburne&#x2019;s teaching quality has also been recognised in the Good Universities Guide, ranking as the best in Melbourne for the last four years (see Rankings for more details).</p>
<p>Swinburne&#x2019;s teaching is also known for its relevance and alignment to industry and preparing students to be work ready.  Swinburne&#x2019;s TAFE and university courses both focus on &#x2018;real-life&#x2019; work situations, including learning for work and learning at work. </p>
<p>Swinburne created the Professional Learning Model (PLM) for undergraduate degrees where students are encouraged to &#x2018;learn by doing&#x2019; and are given as much exposure to the real working world as possible. The PLM also includes a compulsory career planning unit, &#x201c;Careers in the Curriculum &#x201d;  which ensures students have the skills to gain their first professional job. </p>
<p>For TAFE, Swinburne developed the Skills Passport which won the Skills Victoria Training Initiative of the Year Award in 2008.  The Skills Passport starts with a record of a student&#x2019;s existing skills and capabilities and as they progress through their studies, new skills are added and recorded into their own Skills Passport. The Skills Passport aims to show employers that students have the skills to do the job and what added value they&#x2019;ll bring with them.</p>
<h5>Personalisation</h5>
<p>Swinburne is known for offering a personalised approach to their teaching due to a history of smaller class sizes and a focus on hands-on learning. Students are also able to personalise their undergraduate degree through the new Flexible Degree Structure which was introduced into courses at the beginning of 2010. The structure allows students to personalise their degree by choosing subjects across the six faculties to suit their interests and career objectives, adding breadth and depth to their degree.</p>
<h5>Flexibility</h5>
<p>There are a number of flexible study options for students studying at TAFE and university level, which include online study, part-time classes in the evening and weekend, and summer and winter terms.</p>
<p>Swinburne TAFE has a number of different intakes throughout the year which make it easier for students to start when they want. Higher Education has the two traditional intake periods in February and August, with the option of summer and winter terms for current students to spread out or speed up their studies.</p>
<h5>Vocational Education</h5>
<p>Swinburne TAFE delivers vocational education to close to an estimated 15,000 students, a majority of which complete their training in the workplace.  For the students who study on-campus, work based learning is integrated into courses through practical placement or by working on real work projects. Swinburne TAFE was recognised for its excellence in vocational education and training when it was named Large Training Provider of the Year at the 2009 National Training Awards. program has long been giving students the chance to continue on to higher education by awarding TAFE students credit for their previous study into a university degree.</p>
<p>More recently, Swinburne has announced a Guaranteed Entry Scheme  where TAFE students are given a guaranteed spot in a university degree when they enrol into a TAFE course and successfully complete it. This scheme has broken new ground in tertiary education as it presents a packaged offer to domestic students, believed to be unlike any other university in Australia.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Swinburne was established as the Eastern Suburbs Technical College by the Honourable <a>George Swinburne</a> in 1908. The aim was to offer technical education to people in Melbourne&#x2019;s eastern suburbs.  The first courses taught represented the interests of the time which were carpentry, plumbing and gas fitting. </p>
<p>By 1913, the institution had changed its name to Swinburne Technical College to commemorate its founder.</p>
<p>After World War II, Swinburne Technical College expanded to include mechanical and electrical engineering, chemistry, television and film and computer programming. The 1960s saw the first international transition course established in response to an increase in overseas students. The 1960s was also the time when Swinburne began to think and develop academic study with industrial experience, which led to the Industry-Based Learning program still in place today.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s the Federal Government was pushing out an education revolution which resulted in Swinburne being granted university status in 1992.  Swinburne was to continue focusing on delivering education to Melbourne&#x2019;s outer east and would be positioned as an inter-sectoral university of technology.</p>
<p>On 1 July 1992, Swinburne was proclaimed a university and its first Chancellor was self-made businessman and philanthropist, <a>Richard Pratt</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Swinburne continued to grow in Melbourne&#x2019;s eastern suburbs and amalgamated with the Outer Eastern College of TAFE to run courses across five campuses which make up Swinburne today: Croydon, Hawthorn, Lilydale, Prahran and Wantirna.</p>
<p>In 2000, Swinburne open an international campus is Sarawak, Malaysia.</p>
