<p>  The <strong>University of Texas at Dallas</strong>, also referred to as <strong>UT Dallas</strong> or <strong>UTD</strong>, is a public <a>research university</a> in the <a>University of Texas System</a>. The main campus is in the heart of the <a>Richardson</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>Telecom Corridor</a>,  north of <a>downtown</a> <a>Dallas</a>. The institution, established in 1961 as the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest and later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS), began as a research arm of <a>Texas Instruments</a>. In 1969 the founders bequeathed SCAS to the State of Texas and <a>Governor Preston Smith</a> signed the bill officially creating the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
<p>UTD offers over 145 academic programs across its seven schools and hosts more than 50 research centers and institutes. With a number of interdisciplinary degree programs, its curriculum is designed to allow study that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and to enable students to participate in collaborative research labs. Entering freshmen average math and critical reading SAT scores are among the highest of the public universities in Texas and the highest in the state for fall 2010. The <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report's</em> 2011 edition of Best Colleges ranked the university as a &quot;Tier 1&quot; national university with a &quot;more selective&quot; admissions policy. The <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classifies UT Dallas as a &quot;high research activity&quot; institution and the university is designated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research by the <a>National Security Agency</a>. Research projects include the areas of space science, bioengineering, cybersecurity, nanotechnology, and behavioral and brain sciences.</p>
<p>UT Dallas owns generally contiguous land in Richardson, Texas consisting of approximately  for campus development and another  adjacent to the main campus. Almost  of new facilities were added from 2007 to the summer of 2010 and an additional  planned for completion by the summer of 2013. In addition to the new facilities a $30-million dollar campus landscape enhancement was completed in late 2010. The university received a &quot;B-&quot; on the 2011 <em>College Sustainability Report Card</em>, which includes efforts to protect and conserve natural resources. </p>
<p>The school has a Division III athletics program in the <a>American Southwest Conference</a> and fields 13 intercollegiate teams. Student activities include more than 160 registered organizations and students provided more than 20,000 volunteer hours at community agencies in 2009. The university has a nationally recognized debate team, recruits worldwide for its chess team and the only school in Texas to field teams in all three of the major pre-law competitions.

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|Founders Building</a> The UT Dallas founders, <a>Eugene McDermott</a>, <a>Cecil Howard Green</a> and <a>J. Erik Jonsson</a>, purchased <a>Geophysical Service Incorporated</a> (GSI) on December 6, 1941, the day before the <a>attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. With the increase in defense contracts the General Instrument Division of GSI grew to the point it was reorganized as Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) in 1951 with GSI a wholly owned subsidiary. Qualified personnel required by TI were not readily available in the <a>Dallas-Fort Worth area</a> because the region's universities did not provide enough graduates with advanced training in engineering and physical sciences. TI was forced to recruit talent from other states during its expansion and the founders observed in 1959 that &quot;To grow industrially, the region must grow academically; it must provide the intellectual atmosphere, which will allow it to compete in the new industries dependent on highly trained and creative minds&quot;. To compensate for this shortage they established the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1961. The institute initially was housed in the Fondren Science Library at <a>Southern Methodist University</a>. Land for the center was acquired by Jonsson, McDermott, and Green in Richardson in 1962 and the first facility, the Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science (later named the Founders Building), opened on the grounds of the present-day UTD campus in 1964. The Graduate Research Center of the Southwest was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967 and in 1969 the founders transferred the land and assets of SCAS to the State of Texas. Following recommendations from the Coordinating Board of the Texas College and University System, on June 13, 1969, Governor Preston Smith signed the bill adding the institution to the University of Texas System and creating the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1969 the school accepted its first students. Physics, biology and geological sciences were the first PhD degrees offered. Francis S. Johnson served as interim president and William B. Hanson was named the director of the Division of Atmospheric and Space Sciences now known as the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences.</p>
<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Engineering and Computer Science Complex</a> In July 1971, <a>Bryce Jordan</a> became the university&#x2019;s first president and served until 1981. At that time the campus consisted of only one facility, the  Founders Building. During Jordan's 10 year tenure the university's campus expanded with the addition of a number of new facilities including the Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building.. The <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded. Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students. Also in 1975, the <a>School of Management</a> opened and has become the uiversity's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first <a>Nobel</a> laureate, the late <a>Polykarp Kusch</a>, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor. Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the <a>Rutford Ice Stream</a> and <a>Mount Rutford</a> in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders. <a>The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science</a> is now the second-largest school at the university. By its 20th anniversary, in 1989, enrollment at UT Dallas topped 8,000. In 1990, the Texas Legislature authorized the University to admit freshman and sophomore students. Franklyn Jenifer became the third president of UT Dallas in 1994 and served until 2005. Under Jenifer, UT Dallas's enrollment increased more than 61 percent to nearly 14,000.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|School of Management</a> In the fall of 2001 Ray Baughman and Anvar Zakhidov left <a>Honeywell International</a> to establish the UT Dallas NanoTech Institute.

Harold Clarke, the Ashbel Smith professor of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, and Marianne Stewart, professor of political science are the co-principal investigators for the study, which began in 1964 and is one of the world's oldest continuous political research projects. The other two co-investigators are David Sanders and Paul Whiteley of the <a>University of Essex</a> in England.</p>
<h3>Scholarship programs</h3>
<p>In addition to the various scholarship programs UTD provides their Academic Excellence Scholarship Program for freshmen. All freshmen admitted to the University for the fall semester are automatically considered for an Academic Excellence Scholarship Award. The awards range from $2,000 per year up to the cost of tuition and mandatory fees through eight semesters (four years) of enrollment plus $2,000 per year contribution toward rental expenses incurred at University on-campus housing and a cash stipend to defray the cost of books, supplies and other educational expenses. The McDermott Scholars Program, established at UT Dallas in 2000, provides full scholarships and unique cultural and civic opportunities to academically talented high school students. UT Dallas is also among only seven universities whose students are eligible for consideration for Terry Scholarships and became part of the program in 2006.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The main campus is in the heart of the Richardson, Texas, Telecom Corridor,  north of downtown Dallas, on the boundary of <a>Dallas</a> and <a>Collin</a> counties. UT Dallas owns generally contiguous land in Richardson, Texas consisting of approximately  for campus development and another  adjacent to the campus. UTD's Waterview Science &amp; Technology Center and the Research and Operations Center, a leased building, are adjacent to the main campus, on the west side of Waterview Parkway in the Dallas, Texas city limits.  UTD's Callier Center, 8 buildings, is on  adjacent to the <a>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</a> in the city of Dallas and nearby the <a>Center for BrainHealth</a>, a single building, on . The city of Richardson, Texas passed a bond election on May 8, 2010, which allocated $2.8 million in funding for a UT Dallas loop road to connect the roads around campus. The loop road will be designed to help keep traffic contained within the campus, rather than on the city&#x2019;s roads. The university received a &quot;B-&quot; on the 2011 <em>College Sustainability Report Card</em>, which includes efforts to protect and conserve natural resources.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Student Services building</a> Early architecture on the campus exhibits typical characteristics of <a>Brutalism</a>, a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built. In accordance with this style, many of the early buildings are pale, off-white, precast concrete with repetitive structures. Later architecture exhibits late modern or <a>postmodern</a> features such as bronze glass, bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This later modern styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (sometimes called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). The Student Services building, completed in 2010, is rated as a <a>LEED</a> Platinum Building and features a limestone fa&#x00e7;ade that has the appearance of floating from various points within the facility. Many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of <a>skyway</a>s.</p>
<h3>Landscape Architecture</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Campus all&#x00e9;e</a> A 30-million dollar Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott the wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010. The project encompassed all aspects of landscape architecture from campus identity to pedestrian strategies, future growth patterns, sustainability and establishing a campus core. The project included the reforestation of the main entry drive with more than 5,000 native trees. Each tree hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after careful study of native stands in Texas, which includes the commitment to a <a>riparian</a> corridor consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus <a>All&#x00e9;e</a>. The main mall or 'All&#x00e9;e' includes 116 hand-picked columnar 'Claudia Wannamaker' Magnolias alongside five reflecting pools and four human-scale chess boards to represent the national and international achievements of the school's chess team.  At the northern terminus of the All&#x00e9;e and between the McDermott Library and the Student Union is a new pavilion-sized plaza. The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis to be eventually covered in wisteria vines and a temperature-modifying shade structure design. The university also received a $1-million dollar anonymous gift designated for the care of the trees.  The landscape architecture firm of <a>Peter Walker and Partners</a> (PWP) was the prime consultant for the project. PWP is recognized for design of the  Millennium Parklands in Sydney, Australia for the 2000 Summer Olympics and currently the World Trade Center Memorial at Ground Zero in Manhattan.</p>

The nominations were for the following categories, Best Use of the Internet, Best Use of Limited Resources and Station of the Year. In 2009, UTD TV, an internet-based campus TV station, was founded and launched by students. Still in its infancy, it has already webcast a range of student-interest programs from campus news and amusing serial stories to student affairs coverage.</p>

<p><a>thumb|UTD apartments</a> On August 12, 2009 a  residence hall opened providing housing for 384 full-time freshmen residents and 16 peer advisers. The new residence hall offers living learning environments that group students with similar interests and majors. The building includes a mix of three-bedroom, single-bath suites for freshmen and one-bedroom, one-bath units for peer advisers. On each wing and each floor are several communal study areas, and the ground floor features a  glass-enclosed rotunda with pool and ping-pong tables, a large-screen television, couches and chairs. The building also has two classrooms for freshmen-level classes. A second residence hall, directly north to the current hall, is scheduled for completion in 2011. The Phase II residence hall will look identical to the first residence hall but will have additional study lounges and music practice rooms.</p>
<p>Waterview Park consists of four &#x201c;phases&#x201d; of apartments for a total of 696 units and spans . Each phase has a pool and occasionally other recreational areas including volleyball courts and basketball courts. There are 11 floor plans that vary from 1-bedroom efficiencies to 4-bedroom units. An additional seven buildings include offices, study/activity centers and laundry facilities. Waterview attracted a certain amount of controversy, being dubbed &quot;the Dorm from Hell&quot; in an April 2005 article in the <em><a>Dallas Observer</a></em>. University authorities took the allegations seriously enough to institute an internal inquiry. In 2006, $874,000 dollars in repairs were recommended by an inspection agency that was hired in response to this article. Most of the issues in that report have been remediated, as UTD <em>Mercury</em> covered in their report one year later.</p>

<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|upright|Love Jack</a> Some of the traditions that give UT Dallas its distinctive flavor are Homecoming, Annual Oozeball Tournament, Ceremonial Mace, Legacy Lane, Welcome Week, Sounds of Class, Family Day, Splatterbeat and Cecil Green&#x2019;s Head. Cecil Green helped found the University of Texas at Dallas and outside Green Hall there is a bronze bust of Cecil Green. Rubbing Green&#x2019;s head for good luck has become a tradition for many students on their way to exams or presentations. Holiday Sing is one of the oldest tradition on campus, the annual Holiday Sing started in 1976 and is hosted by the School of Arts and Humanities during the month of December. In front of the Erik Jonsson Academic Center is the sculpture <em>Jack</em>, created in 1971 by artist <a>Jim Love</a> (1927 - 2005). Margaret McDermott, wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), presented the sculpture to the university in 1976. The sculpture is affectionately known on campus as the Love Jack. Recently added is the Spirit Rock on the mall between the Jonsson and Green buildings. Students and organizations are allowed to paint whatever they like on the rock, provided it conforms to rules of student conduct.</p>
