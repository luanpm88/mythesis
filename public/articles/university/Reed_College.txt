<p></p>
<p><strong>Reed College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>independent</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in southeast <a>Portland, Oregon</a>. Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus located in Portland's <a>Eastmoreland</a> neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the <a>Tudor</a>-<a>Gothic</a> style,&lt;ref name=&quot;coat-of-arms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a forested canyon wilderness preserve at its center. Reed is known for its mandatory freshman <a>humanities</a> program, for its required senior-year thesis, as the only private undergraduate college with a primarily student-run <a>nuclear reactor</a> supporting its science programs,&lt;ref name=&quot;reactor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and for the unusually high percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs and other postgraduate degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;phds&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a list with actual percentages, see &quot;Doctorates Awarded&quot; at <a>http://www.swarthmore.edu/x15575.xml</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Reed College's Eliot Hall on a rare snowy day.</a> The <strong>Reed Institute</strong> (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908, and Reed College held its first classes in 1911. Reed is named for Oregon pioneers <a>Simeon Gannett Reed</a> and Amanda Reed.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon was an entrepreneur in trade on the <a>Columbia River</a>; in his will he suggested that his wife could &quot;devote some portion of my estate to benevolent objects, or to the cultivation, illustration, or development of the fine arts in the city of Portland, or to some other suitable purpose, which shall be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city and to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Retrieved on 19 December 2007.</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  The first president of Reed (1910&ndash;1919) was <a>William Trufant Foster</a>, a former professor at <a>Bates College</a> and <a>Bowdoin College</a> in <a>Maine</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the college did not grow out of student revolts and experimentation, but out of a desire to provide a &quot;more flexible, individualized approach to a rigorous liberal arts education&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;contrary&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded explicitly in reaction to the &quot;prevailing model of East Coast, <a>Ivy League</a> education,&quot; the college's lack of <a>varsity athletics</a>, <a>fraternities</a>, and exclusive social clubs &mdash; as well as its <a>coeducational</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, and <a>egalitarian</a> status &mdash; gave way to an intensely academic and intellectual college whose purpose was to devote itself to &quot;the life of the mind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;reaction&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The college holds a reputation for the <a>progressive</a>&lt;ref name=&quot;lefty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-authoritarian leanings of its community.</p>
<h2>Distinguishing features</h2>
<p>According to <a>sociologist</a> Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the <a>United States</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110 &mdash; an intensive introduction to the <a>Classics</a>, covering ancient <a>Greece</a> and <a>Rome</a> as well as the <a>Bible</a> and <a>ancient Jewish history</a>. Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual &mdash; Reed's <a>TRIGA research reactor</a> makes it the only school in the United States to have a <a>nuclear reactor</a> operated entirely by undergraduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;reactor&quot; /&gt; Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation, and passing a junior qualifying exam at the end of the junior year is a prerequisite to beginning the thesis. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral exam that may encompass questions not only about the thesis, but also about any course previously taken.</p>
<p>Reed maintains a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio,&lt;ref name=&quot;ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and its small classes emphasize a &quot;conference&quot; style, in which the teacher often acts as a mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer. While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.</p>
<p>Although letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed.  According to the school, &quot;[s]tudents are encouraged to focus on learning, not on grades. Students are evaluated rigorously, and semester grades are filed with the registrar, but by tradition, students do not receive standard grade reports. Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed. There is no <a>dean&#x2019;s list</a> or honor roll per se, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an entire academic year receive academic commendations, which are noted on their transcripts, at the end of the spring semester.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/eval_student.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Many Reedies graduate without knowing either their cumulative <a>GPA</a> or their grades in individual classes. Reed also claims to have experienced very little grade inflation over the years, noting, for example,  that only seven students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2007&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;grades&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; (Transcripts are accompanied by a card explaining Reed's relatively tough grading system, so as to not penalize students applying to graduate schools.)&lt;ref&gt;<a>Retrieved on 13 September 2008</a>&lt;/ref&gt; And though Reed does not award <a>Latin honors</a> to graduates, Reed does confer several awards for academic achievement at the time of commencement, including naming students to <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/awards.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed has no fraternities or <a>sororities</a>, and few <a>NCAA</a> sports teams,&lt;ref&gt;One NCAA sports team at Reed has been the Reed College Ski Team, which as early as 1937, and as late as 1988, competed with the <a>University of Oregon</a> and other regional schools. See <a>&quot;Oregon Ski Team to meet Huskies,&quot; Eugene Register-Guard, December 14, 1937</a>&lt;/ref&gt; although physical education classes (which range from <a>kayaking</a> to <a>juggling</a>) are required for graduation. Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic teams, most notably the Rugby, Fencing, and Ultimate Frisbee teams.  Reed's ethical code is known as &quot;The Honor Principle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  First introduced as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior, with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of the burden of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life. While inspired by traditional <a>honor system</a>s, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves, not just their enforcement. Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior. Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>Discrete cases of grievance, known as &quot;Honor Cases&quot;, are adjudicated by a Judicial Board, which consists of nine full-time students. There is also an &quot;Honor Council,&quot; which consists of students, faculty, and staff, designed to educate the community regarding the Honor Principle and mediate conflict between individuals.</p>
<h2>Academic program</h2>
<p>Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program. Overall, Reed offers five <a>Humanities</a> courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Humanities program</h3>
<p>Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole &quot;an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and, ... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Richard F., &quot;Remarks to the Association of American Colleges&quot;, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in &quot;world&quot; literature, the other in &quot;world&quot; history) is one manifestation of this effort. One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995. The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus. These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Humanities 110, Syllabus for 2010-2013</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course <em>Introduction to Western Humanities</em> covering ancient <a>Greek</a> and <a>Roman</a> literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take <em>Early Modern Europe</em> covering <a>Renaissance</a> thought and literature; <em>Modern Humanities</em> covering the <a>Enlightenment</a>, the <a>French Revolution</a>, the <a>Industrial Revolution</a>, and <a>Modernism</a>, and/or <em>Foundations of Chinese Civilization</em>. There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.</p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary and dual-degree programs</h3>
<p>Reed also offers interdisciplinary programs in American studies,&lt;ref&gt;<a>American Studies</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental Studies,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Environmental Studies Interdisciplinary Major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Biochem &amp; Molec Bio interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Chemistry-Physics,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Chem-Physics interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Classics-Religion,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Classics-Religion Interdisciplinary Major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Dance/Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Dance-Theatre Interdisciplinary Major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; History-Literature,&lt;ref&gt;<a>History-Lit interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; International and Comparative Policy Studies (ICPS),&lt;ref&gt;<a>Internat-Compar Policy Studies</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Literature-Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Lit-Theater interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics-Economics,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Math-Econ interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathematics-Physics.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Math-Physics interdisc major</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed offers <a>dual-degree programs</a> in Applied Physics (with <a>OHSU</a>/<a>OGI</a>), Computer Science (with <a>University of Washington</a>), Engineering (with <a>Caltech</a> and others), Environmental Science (with <a>Duke University</a>), and Fine Art (with the <a>Pacific Northwest College of Art</a>).&lt;ref&gt;<a>Dual degree program info</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Admissions and student demographics</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Eliot Hall</a> Until the late 1990s, Reed accepted a larger percentage of total applicants than peer institutions &#x2014; 76% in 1996. This led to high levels of attrition (drop-outs) during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Romel Hernandez, &quot;Many Apply. Few Are Chosen,&quot; <a>Reed Magazine (Spring 2008): 26-33</a>.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of applicants for freshman admission has increased sharply.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2002, Reed's attrition rate has moved toward that of peer institutions, and the five-year graduation rate (76% for the 2003/2004 entering class&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://web.reed.edu/ir/cds/cds0910/cdssecb200910.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;) now exceeds the national average. </p>
<p>In 2009, the applicant pool for the class of 2013 was the third largest in Reed's history: 3,159 students applied and 1,225 were admitted, for an admission rate of 38.8%. The admitted class of 2013's average combined Math and Verbal <a>SAT</a> scores were 1407; the mean composite ACT score was 31; and the mean high school <a>GPA</a> was 4.034.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed's student body is 45% male and 55% female, and includes 22% minority students: 3% self-report as Black (including African-American, African, and Afro-Caribbean); 6% as Hispanic; 9% as Asian, 2% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Minority numbers include some of the 7% international citizens (13% of freshmen did not self-report their ethnicity). In the class of 2010, 38% of students are from the United States's West Coast (<a>California</a>, Oregon, <a>Washington</a>), with the most coming from California.</p>
<h3>Tuition and finances</h3>
<p>The total base cost for the 2010-11 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, is $51,850.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-10 about half of students received financial aid from the college.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Financial aid 2009-10</a>. This cost does not include travel to and from college and home, books and supplies, and miscellaneous expenses.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 (the most recent data available), 1.4% of Reed graduates defaulted on their student loans&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; --  below the national <a>Cohort Default Rate</a> average of 5.1%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed's endowment as of June 30, 2008 was $427.3 million, below the median of about $500m for comparable schools, and well below Amherst and Swarthmore's approximately one billion dollar endowments.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2008 NACUBO Endowment Study,&quot; <a>National Association of College and University Business Officers, January 2009</a>.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 fiscal year, the endowment is expected to contribute about $19 million toward the college's operating expenses, an increase of about $3 million from two years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.reed.edu/ir/endowincome.html</a>. Note, however, that in the economic downturn that began in late 2007, Reed's total endowment declined by about 6% from $455 million in June 2007 to 427 in June 2008. See &quot;2008 NACUBO Endowment Study,&quot; cited earlier.]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> In 1995 Reed College refused to participate in the <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> &quot;best colleges&quot; rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings. According to Reed's Office of Admissions:  </p>
<p><em><a>Rolling Stone</a></em>, in its 16 October 1997 issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by <em>U.S. News</em> after they stopped sending data to <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a>.</em>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Nicholas Thompson reiterated this judgment in an article in <em>The Washington Monthly</em> in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Thompson, &quot;Playing With Numbers How U.S. News Mismeasures Higher Education and What We Can Do About It,&quot; <a><em>Washington Monthly</em> (September 2000).</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  Reed has also made the same claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;College Rankings&quot;/&gt; In discussing Reed's decision, President <a>Colin Diver</a> wrote in an article for the November 2005 issue of the <em><a>Atlantic Monthly</a>,</em> &quot;by far the most important consequence of sitting out the rankings game, however, is the freedom to pursue our own educational philosophy, not that of some news magazine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>However, in 2005 Reed did submit statistics to the <a>Princeton Review</a>, and received first in Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience. In 2009, The <a>Princeton Review</a> ranked Reed number two in &quot;Best Classroom Experience,&quot; number three in &quot;Students Study the Most,&quot; and number five in &quot;Birkenstock-Wearing, Tree-Hugging, Clove-Smoking Vegetarians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeRankings.aspx?iid=1023568</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, <a>Newsweek</a> magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; listing it among &quot;the nation's elite colleges&quot;. The guide to college admissions for <a>About.com</a>, moreover, places Reed as one of the top ten liberal arts colleges in the country.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://collegeapps.about.com/od/choosingacollege/tp/top_colleges.htm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Academic honors</h3>
<p>Reed has produced the second-highest number of <a>Rhodes scholars</a> for any liberal arts college&mdash;31&mdash;as well as over fifty <a>Fulbright Scholars</a>, over sixty <a>Watson Fellow</a>s, and two <a>MacArthur (&quot;Genius&quot;) Award</a> winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholars&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn <a>Ph.D.</a>s, particularly in the <a>science</a>s, <a>history</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>philosophy</a>. Reed is third in percentage of its graduates who go on to earn Ph.D.s in all disciplines, after only <a>Caltech</a> and <a>Harvey Mudd</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;phds&quot; /&gt;  In 1961, <em><a>Scientific American</a></em> declared that second only to Caltech, &quot;This small college in Oregon has been far and away more productive of future scientists than any other institution in the U.S.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sascience&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sascience2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Reed is first in this percentage in <a>biology</a>, second in <a>chemistry</a> and <a>humanities</a>, third in <a>history</a>, <a>foreign language</a>s, and <a>political science</a>, fourth in the <a>physical sciences</a>, <a>math</a> and <a>computer science</a>, and <a>science</a> and <a>engineering</a>, fifth in <a>physics</a> and <a>social sciences</a>, sixth in <a>anthropology</a>, seventh in <a>area and ethnic studies</a> and <a>linguistics</a>, and eighth in <a>English literature</a> and the <a>medical sciences</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;phds&quot; /&gt; </p>
<p>Reed's debating team, which had existed for only two years at the time, was awarded the first place sweepstakes trophy for <a>Division II</a> schools at the final tournament of the Northwest Forensics Conference in February 2004.</p>
<p><a>Loren Pope</a>, former education editor for <em><a>The New York Times</a>,</em> writes about Reed in <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a>,</em> saying, &quot;If you're a genuine intellectual, live the life of the mind, and want to learn for the sake of learning, the place most likely to empower you is not Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, or Stanford. It is the most intellectual college in the country&#x2014;Reed in Portland, Oregon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lpope&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<h3>Political</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Dorm Block</a>&#x0009;  Reed has a reputation for being politically left-wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;lefty&quot; /&gt;  Whether in fact Reed's student body is more leftist than those of similar colleges is difficult to determine, but Reed's academic tradition of open and passionate debate often spills into the off-campus political arena and, combined with the freewheeling social environment, often leads to the appearance of radical leftism.</p>
<p>During the <a>McCarthy era</a> of the 1950s, then-President Duncan Ballantine fired Marxist philosopher Stanley Moore, a tenured professor, for his failure to cooperate with the <a>HUAC</a> investigation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, &quot;because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities. Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and untenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest. At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A statement of &quot;regret&quot; by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees. In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the College, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Drug use</h3>
<p>Since the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students.&lt;ref&gt; Link found to be inactive 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; <em><a>The Insider's Guide to the Colleges</a></em>, written by the staff of <em><a>Yale Daily News</a></em>, notes an impression among students of institutional permissiveness: &quot;according to students, the school does not bust students for drug or alcohol use unless they cause harm or embarrassment to another student&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;yaledaily&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|A. E. Doyle's 1920 Master Plan</a> The Reed College campus was established on a southeast <a>Portland</a> tract of land known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims. The college's grounds include 116 contiguous acres, including a wooded wetland known as Reed canyon (see below).</p>
<p>Portland architect <a>A. E. Doyle</a> developed a plan modeled on <a>Oxford University</a>'s St. John's College that was never implemented in full. The original campus buildings (including the Library, the Old Dorm Block, and what is now the primary administration building, Eliot Hall) are brick <a>Tudor Gothic</a> buildings in a style similar to <a>Ivy League</a> campuses. In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the <a>Modernist</a> style. The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by famed Modernist architect <a>Pietro Belluschi</a> at the same time as his celebrated <a>Equitable Building</a> in downtown Portland.</p>
<p>The campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth, and there are now twenty-one academic and administrative buildings and eighteen residence halls. Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy. At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use. Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a  tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive. Reed&#x2019;s &quot;immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007&#x2013;08 academic year. Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Reed College press release</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed also owns more than a dozen homes adjacent to the campus that are used to house new and visiting faculty.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Old Dorm Block</a> Reed houses about 1,000 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Master Plan&quot; /&gt; Residence halls on campus range from the traditional (i.e., Gothic Old Dorm Block, referred to as &quot;ODB&quot;) to the eclectic (e.g., Anna Mann, a Tudor-style cottage built in the 1920s by Reed's founding architect A. E. Doyle, originally used as a women's hall,&lt;ref name=&quot;romel&quot;&gt;Romel Hernandez, &quot;This New House,&quot; <a><em>Reed</em></a> (Spring 2007), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;) language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), &quot;temporary&quot; housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon - Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan). There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to a cat residence hall. The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the College's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as &quot;Asylum Block&quot; because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an <a>insane asylum</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;asylum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect <a>Pietro Belluschi</a>.  </p>
<p>Under the 10-year Campus Master Plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced, and MacNaughton to be remodeled.&lt;ref name = &quot;Master Plan&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the master plan, &quot;The College's goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the [full-time] student population. At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Master Plan&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>In Spring 2007, the College broke ground on the construction of a new quadrangle with four new residence halls on the northwest side of the campus, which opened in Fall 2008. A new Spanish House residence has also been completed. Together, the five new residences add 142 new beds.&lt;ref name=&quot;romel&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h3>Reed Canyon</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Blue Bridge</a> The Reed College Canyon, a natural area and national wildlife preserve, bisects the campus, separating the academic buildings from many of the residence halls (the so called <em>cross-canyon halls</em>). The canyon is filled by Crystal Creek Springs, a <a>natural spring</a> that drains into <a>Johnson Creek</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Canyon Day, a tradition spanning more than ninety years, is held twice a year. On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;canyon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A landmark of the campus, the <a>Blue Bridge</a>, spans the canyon. It appears on almost every viewbook that the college circulates. This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which &quot;featured stressed plywood girders &mdash; the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge  long and  high. It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Bridge was originally  known as the &quot;Cross Canyon Bridge&quot; until student Rain Lynham bought and installed black lights in 1998 as decoration for Renn Fayre, the traditional end of year, campus-wide party, of which she was the organizer that year. The new look proved so popular with students and faculty alike that the original white bulbs were never replaced.</p>
<p>A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008. This bridge, dubbed the &quot;Bouncy Bridge&quot; by students, is  long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and &quot;connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;romel&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Douglas F. Cooley Gallery</h3>
<p>Reed's Cooley Gallery is an internationally recognized contemporary art space located at the entrance to Reed's Hauser Library. It was established in 1988 as the result of a gift from Susan and Edward Cooley in honor of their late son.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as <a>Mona Hatoum</a>, <a>Al Held</a>, <a>Marko Lulic</a> and <a>Gregory Crewdson</a> as well as the contemporary art collection of <a>Michael Ovitz</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;collection&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits. The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder,&lt;ref name=&quot;snyder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.</p>
<h3>Food services</h3>
<p>The cafeteria, known simply as &quot;Commons&quot;, has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services. The commons dining hall is operated by <a>Bon App&#x00e9;tit</a>, and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis. Suiting the student body, <a>vegan</a> and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu. It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception Caffe Paradiso, a small cafe on the other side of campus which also accepts board points.</p>
<p>The Reed College Co-op is a theme residence located in Garden House, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall. It is the only campus dorm that is independent of the school's board plan. This residence houses ten students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings. It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants. </p>
<p>The Paradox (&quot;Est. in the 80s&quot;) is a student-run cafe located on campus. In 2003 the Paradox opened a second cafe, dubbing it the &quot;Paradox Lost&quot; (an allusion to <a>John Milton</a>'s <em><a>Paradise Lost</a></em>), at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the &quot;Bio Fishbowl&quot;. The new north-campus dorms, which opened in Fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, dubbed &quot;Cafe Paradiso&quot;, thereby providing three coffee shops within a  campus. This third shop is not student-run, but is handled instead by an outside catering service.</p>
<h3>Off-campus housing</h3>
<p>Reed also has off-campus housing. Many houses in the <a>Woodstock</a> and <a>Eastmoreland</a> Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students. Many students traditionally give their houses creative nicknames as well, which can last through multiple cycles of rentership. &lt;!-- Please see note on talk page about house names --&gt;</p>
<h2>Icons and student life</h2>
<h3>Griffin</h3>
<p>The official mascot of Reed is the <a>griffin</a>. In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of <a>Dante</a>'s <em><a>Commedia</a></em> the <a>gryphon</a> is associated with the <a>Tree of Knowledge</a>. The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed&lt;ref name=&quot;coat-of-arms&quot; /&gt; and is now on the official seal of Reed College.</p>
<h3>School color</h3>
<p>The official school color of Reed is Richmond Rose.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Reed Virtual Tour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon. The most common examples of &quot;Richmond Rose&quot; are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.</p>
<h3>School song</h3>
<p>The school song, &quot;Fair Reed,&quot; is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song &quot;Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;. It was composed by former president <a>William Trufant Foster</a> shortly after Reed's founding, and is rarely heard today.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Student nickname</h3>
<p>Reed students and alumni referred to themselves as &quot;Reedites&quot; in the early years of the college. This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous &quot;Reedie&quot; after <a>World War II</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;reeditesreedies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Around campus, prospective students are called &quot;prospies&quot;.</p>
<h3>Unofficial mottos and folklore</h3>
<p>An unofficial <a>motto</a> of Reed is &quot;Communism, Atheism, Free Love&quot;, and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, t-shirts, etc. It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek slogan&quot; in reference to Reed's <a>nonconformism</a>. Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into <a>World War I</a>, as well as the college's support for <a>feminism</a>, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the <a>Socialist Party of America</a> to speak on campus about the <a>Russian Revolution</a>&#x2019;s potential impact on <a>militarism</a>, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its <a>nonsectarian</a> status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.&lt;ref name=&quot;cafl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;caflquote&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>An alternative motto first appeared on shirts in 1976 as &quot;Capitalism, Avarice, Free Beer&quot;, but never overtook the original in popularity. A small group of students has recently been petitioning the bookstore to update the shirts' text to read, &quot;Socialism, Agnosticism, Safe Sex&quot;, a comment on the increasingly moderate (though still quite radical) predominating values of the student body. Additionally, the punning &quot;Reed: You Might Learn Something&quot; was a popular slogan in the mid-1980s.&lt;br /&gt; <a>150px|thumb|left|Faux Reed Seal</a> Another popular characterization was from a letter to the local newspaper, in which Reed students were said to resemble &quot;unmade beds&quot; which provided a subject for creating special Reed occasion costumes. </p>
<p>Every year's <em>Reed College Student Handbook</em> (a manual on student life written by students, not to be confused with the <em>College Handbook</em>, which is written by college officials) contains a test called the &quot;Reed College Immorality Quotient&quot; that tests an individual's <a>immorality</a> on topics such as <a>sex</a>, <a>theft</a>, and <a>drug use</a>.</p>
<p>One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly  concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since 1913. The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl's <a>oral history</a>. The original Doyle Owl was almost certainly destroyed many years ago, but a number of replicas (of varying degrees of quality) remain in circulation, contributing to the frequency of its appearance. </p>
<p>Well-known on-campus myths claim there is an intact <a>MG</a> under the concrete foundation of the college library, an underground primate lab working exclusively with <a>snow monkey</a>s under the Psychology building (the legend states that the presence of this lab was discovered when a snow monkey escaped into the Canyon and necessitated the closing of the facility), and a four-story lab/habitation <a>arcology</a> under the Physics building. There are many other such stories, often referred to as &quot;Reed legends&quot;.</p>
<h3>Paideia</h3>
<p>During the week before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds <a>Paideia</a> (roughly drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education').&lt;ref name=&quot;reed.edu&quot;&gt;<a>http://www.reed.edu/apply/student_life/favorite_traditions.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt; This festival of learning takes the form of ten days (although originally a whole month) of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community. The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed.edu&quot;/&gt; Many such classes are explicitly trivial (one long-running tradition is to hold an <a>underwater basket weaving</a> class), while others are trivially academic (such as &quot;Giant Concrete Gnome Construction&quot;, a class that, incidental to building monolithic <a>gnome</a>s, includes some content relating to the construction of pre-Christian <a>monolith</a>s). More structured classes (such as <a>martial arts</a> seminars and mini-classes on obscure academic topics), tournaments, and film festivals round out the schedule, which is different every year. The objective of Paideia is not only to learn new (possibly non-useful) things, but to turn the tables on students and encourage them to teach.</p>
<p>In his 2005 Stanford commencement lecture, <a>Apple Computer</a> founder and Reed <a>drop out</a> <a>Steve Jobs</a> credited a Reed <a>calligraphy</a> class for his focus on choosing quality typefaces for the <a>Macintosh</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  While the full calligraphy course is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject.</p>
<h3>Renn Fayre</h3>
<p>[[Image:Olde-Reede-RennFayre06.JPG|thumb|right|A student-made [[Katamari Damacy|katamari]] at the 2006 Renn Fayre]] Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration at Reed with a different theme each year. Born in the 1960s as an actual <a>renaissance fair</a>, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the <a>Renaissance</a>, although its name has persisted.</p>
<p>Renn Fayre commences with the Thesis Parade, where graduating seniors make a symbolic march to deliver their theses to the registrar and a fiery pit to burn the year's notes. Students, faculty, and staff gather at the entrance to the library where chaos and champagne get the party started. The parade commences when the senior class moves through the library and out through what was the library's original front entrance (now an emergency exit).</p>
<p>The Fayre runs from Friday to Sunday, beginning on the last day of classes for the spring semester. The week after Renn Fayre is Reading Week, in which no classes are held; final examinations are held in the following week.</p>
<p>Renn Fayre is often called the metaphorical explosion of the student body after a year of intense pressure. Traditions and events include bizarre art installations, bug-eating contests, the alumni Meat Smoke, a naked <a>Slip 'n Slide</a>, occasional motorized couches, fireworks, naked people painting themselves blue (a tribute to the ancient <a>Picts</a>), a <a>beer garden</a>, the Glo Opera (performed at night by actors covered in EL wire and glowsticks), lube wrestling, full-contact human chess, parachuters, castle-storming and bike-jousting by members of <a>C.H.V.N.K. 666</a>, a fire-dancing performance by the Weapons of Mass Distraction (the college's own Fire Troupe), a softball tournament of academic department teams, a feast contributed to by student-donated leftover board points, a cooking contest, and a general sense of mayhem. Serious injuries are rare, thanks in part to the non-profit White Bird Clinic, and the presence of vigilant student volunteers (the &quot;Karma Patrol&quot;) who stay sober, distribute bagels and water, and ensure the wellness of Renn Fayre participants, while the &quot;Border Patrol&quot; sees to the exclusion of unauthorized visitors.</p>
<p>Student participation is almost unanimous; faculty and staff also attend some of the festivities. Alumni and authorized guests may also participate.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p>According to Reed's website, each semester, a $130 student body fee &quot;is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate. The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>College Catalog - Reed College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Student body funds (totalling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester's funding poll. The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either 'top six', 'approve', 'no opinion', 'disapprove' or 'deep six.' These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see <a>Signators' Handbook</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus. The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.  </p>
<p>The school's student-run newspaper, the <em>Quest</em>, has been published since 1913, and its radio station, <a>KRRC</a>, has been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, since 1955.&lt;ref name=reedmag&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=studmedia&gt;<a>Reed College: Student media</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Most organizations are highly informal, although some that partner with outside groups such as <a>Oxfam</a> or <a>Planned Parenthood</a> are more structured. The Reed archive of <a>comic book</a>s and <a>graphic novel</a>s, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various <a>beer garden</a>s throughout the year and during <a>Renn Fayre</a>, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective &ndash; dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture &#x2013; have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Reed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on Mount Hood, recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
