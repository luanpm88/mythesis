<p><strong>Washington University in St. Louis</strong> (<strong>Wash U, WUSTL</strong>) is a private <a>research university</a> located in suburban <a>St. Louis</a>, <a>Missouri</a>. Founded in 1853, and named for <a>George Washington</a>, the university has students and faculty from all fifty U.S. states and more than 110 nations. Twenty-two <a>Nobel laureates</a> have been affiliated with Washington University, nine doing the major part of their pioneering research at the university.  Washington University's undergraduate program  is ranked 13th in the nation and 6th in admissions selectivity by <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em>. The university is also ranked 30th in the world by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>. In 2006, the university received $434 million in federal research funds, ranking seventh among private universities receiving federal research and development support, and in the top four in funding from the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>
<p>Washington University is made up of seven <a>graduate</a> and <a>undergraduate</a> schools that encompass a broad range of <a>academic fields</a>. Officially incorporated as &quot;The Washington University&quot;, the university is occasionally referred to as WUSTL, an acronym derived from the initials of the university's name plus &quot;STL&quot; for St. Louis. To prevent confusion over its location, the <a>Board of Trustees</a> added the phrase &quot;in St. Louis&quot; in 1976.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History (1853&#x2013;1900)</h3>
<p>Washington University was conceived by seventeen <a>St. Louis</a> business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the <a>Midwest</a>. Missouri State Senator <a>Wayman Crow</a> and <a>Unitarian</a> minister <a>William Greenleaf Eliot</a>, grandfather of the poet <a>T.S. Eliot</a>, led the effort.</p>
<p>The university's first chancellor was <a>Joseph Gibson Hoyt</a>. Crow secured the university charter from the <a>Missouri General Assembly</a> in 1853, and he carried out further political maneuvering. While Eliot was in charge of raising funds for the university, he accepted the position as the president of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including <a>John O'Fallon</a>, one of the wealthiest people in St. Louis, but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. In fact, Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support. Financial problems plagued Washington University for several decades after its founding. <a>150px|thumbnail|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees|left</a></p>
<p>During the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved &quot;Eliot Seminary&quot;, but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university. In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to &quot;Washington Institute&quot; in honor of <a>George Washington</a>. Naming the University after the nation's first president, only seven years before the <a>American Civil War</a> and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of America and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the University amended its name to &quot;Washington University.&quot; The university amended its name once more in 1976 when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix &quot;in St. Louis&quot; to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen universities bearing Washington's name. Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, <a>Smith Academy</a>, and the <a>Mary Institute</a>.</p>
<p>In 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian <a>law school</a> west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing the <a>School of Medicine</a>. During the 1890s, <a>Robert Sommers Brookings</a>, the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.</p>
<h3>Modern Era (1900&#x2013;1955)</h3>
<p>[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|190px|right|thumb|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]] Washington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the University began to move west. The University Board of Directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm <a>Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot</a> of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, <a>Henry Ware Eliot</a>, and William Huse found a site of  just beyond <a>Forest Park</a>, located west of the city limits in <a>St. Louis County</a>. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the <a>Acropolis</a> and inspired the nickname of &quot;Hilltop&quot; campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor <a>William H. Danforth</a>.</p>
<p>In 1899, the university opened a national design contest for the new campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm <a>Cope &amp; Stewardson</a> won unanimously with its plan for a row of <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> quadrangles inspired by <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of <a>Brookings Hall</a>, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the <a>1904 World's Fair</a> and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope &amp; Stewardson&#x2019;s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.</p>
<p>In 1922, a young physics professor, <a>Arthur Holly Compton</a>, conducted a series of experiments in the basement of Eads Hall that demonstrated the &quot;particle&quot; concept of electromagnetic radiation. Compton&#x2019;s discovery, known as the &#x201c;<a>Compton Effect</a>&#x201d;, earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927. After working for many years at the <a>University of Chicago</a>, Arthur Holly Compton returned to St. Louis in 1946 to serve as Washington University&#x2019;s ninth chancellor. Compton reestablished the Washington University football team, making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a &quot;strictly amateur&quot; basis with no athletic scholarships. Under Compton&#x2019;s leadership, enrollment at the University grew dramatically, fueled primarily by World War&nbsp;II veterans' use of their GI Bill benefits.</p>
<p>In 1947, <a>Gerty Cori</a>, a professor at the School of Medicine, became the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Professors Carl and Gerty Cori became Washington University's fifth and sixth Nobel laureates for their discovery of how glycogen is broken down and resynthesized in the body.</p>
<p>The process of desegregation at Washington University began in 1947 with the School of Medicine and the School of Social Work. During the mid and late 1940s, the University was the target of critical editorials in the local African American press, letter-writing campaigns by churches and the local <a>Urban League</a>, and legal briefs by the NAACP intended to strip its tax-exempt status. In spring 1949, a Washington University student group, the Student Committee for the Admission of Negroes (SCAN), began campaigning for full racial integration. In May 1952, the Board of Trustees passed a resolution desegregating the school's undergraduate divisions.</p>
<h3>Recent History (1955&#x2013;present)</h3>
<p><a>260px|thumb|right|Graham Chapel</a> During the latter half of the twentieth century, Washington University transitioned from a strong regional university to a national research institution. In 1957, planning began for the construction of the &#x201c;South 40,&#x201d; a complex of modern residential halls. With the additional on-campus housing, Washington University, which had been predominately a &#x201c;streetcar college&#x201d; of commuter students, began to attract a more national pool of applicants. By 1964, over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the St. Louis area.</p>
<p>In 1971, the Board of Trustees appointed Chancellor <a>William Henry Danforth</a>, who guided the university through the social and financial crises of the 1970s and strengthened the university&#x2019;s often strained relationship with the St. Louis community. During his 24-year chancellorship, Danforth significantly improved the <a>School of Medicine</a>, established 70 new faculty chairs, secured a $1.72 billion endowment, and tripled the amount of student scholarships.</p>
<p>In 1995, <a>Mark S. Wrighton</a>, former Provost at <a>MIT</a>, was elected the university&#x2019;s 14th chancellor. During Chancellor Wrighton's tenure undergraduate applications to Washington University have more than doubled. Since 1995, the University has added more than 190 endowed professorships, revamped its Arts &amp; Sciences curriculum, and completed more than 30 new buildings.</p>
<p>The growth of Washington University&#x2019;s reputation has coincided with a series of record-breaking fund-raising efforts during the last three decades. From 1983 to 1987, the &#x201c;Alliance for Washington University&#x201d; campaign raised $630.5 million, which was then the most successful fund-raising effort in national history. From 1998 to 2004, the &#x201c;Campaign for Washington University&#x201d; raised $1.55 billion, which has been applied to additional scholarships, professorships, and research initiatives.</p>
<h3>U.S. Presidential and Vice Presidential debates</h3>
<p>[[Image:Wustldebate08.JPG|260px|thumb|right|[[2008 Vice Presidential Debate]] at the Washington University Field House]] Washington University has been selected by the <a>Commission on Presidential Debates</a> to host more presidential and vice presidential debates than any other institution in history. The University has been selected to host a presidential or vice presidential debate in every United States presidential election since 1992. <a>United States presidential election debates</a> were held at the Washington University Athletic Complex in 1992, 2000, and [[United States presidential election debates, 2004#Second presidential debate&nbsp;&#x2014; October 8|2004]]. A presidential debate was planned to occur in 1996, but owing to scheduling difficulties between the candidates, the debate was canceled. The university hosted the only 2008 vice presidential debate, between <a>Republican</a> <a>Sarah Palin</a> and <a>Democrat</a> <a>Joe Biden</a>, on October 2, 2008, also at the Washington University Athletic Complex.</p>
<p>Although Chancellor Wrighton had noted after the 2004 debate that it would be &quot;improbable&quot; that the University will host another debate and was not eager to commit to the possibility, he subsequently changed his view and the University submitted a bid for the 2008 debates. &quot;These one-of-a-kind events are great experiences for our students, they contribute to a national understanding of important issues, and they allow us to help bring national and international attention to the St. Louis region as one of America's great metropolitan areas,&quot; said Wrighton.</p>

Danforth</a>, the 13th Chancellor of the University, the Danforth family, and the Danforth Foundation.</p>
<p>The construction of Danforth Campus was accelerated through a profitable lease of several buildings to the <a>1904 St. Louis World's Fair</a>. At the fair's conclusion, the newly-constructed buildings assumed their original functions as classrooms and administrative offices. Additionally, <a>Francis Field</a>, the grounds of the <a>1904 Summer Olympics</a>, and Francis Gymnasium were converted for use by the Washington University athletic department.</p>
<p>The Danforth Campus is accessible by the <a>University City-Big Bend</a> and <a>Skinker</a> stations on the MetroLink's recently-opened cross-county extension, which provides easy access to the Washington University Medical Campus, the North Campus, and the West Campus.</p>
<h3>Medical Campus</h3>

The University acquired the building and adjacent property in 2004, formerly home to the Angelica Uniform Factory. Several University administrative departments are located at the North Campus location, including offices for Quadrangle Housing, Accounting and Treasury Services, Parking and Transportation Services, <a>Army ROTC</a>, and Network Technology Services. The North Campus location also provides off-site storage space for the <a>Performing Arts</a> Department. Renovations are still ongoing; the most recent addition to the North Campus space was a small eatery operated by <a>Bon App&#x00e9;tit Management Company</a>, the University's on-campus food provider, completed during spring semester 2007.</p>
<p>The West Campus is located about a mile to the west of the Danforth Campus in <a>Clayton, Missouri</a>, and primarily consists of a three-story former <a>department store</a> building housing mostly administrative space. The West Campus building was home to the Clayton branch of the <a>Famous-Barr</a> department store until 1990, when the University acquired the property and adjacent parking and began a series of renovations. Today, the basement level houses the Library archives and a conference center. The ground level still remains a retail space. The upper floors consolidated capital gifts, portions of alumni and development, and <a>information systems</a> offices from across the Danforth and Medical School campuses. There is also a music rehearsal room on the second floor. The West Campus is also home to the Center for the Application of Information Technologies (CAIT), which provides IT training services.</p>

In 1999, the Program was granted approval by Washington University to offer a <a>Doctor of Physical Therapy</a> (DPT) at both the professional and post-professional levels. The two new clinical doctorate programs replaced the <a>Master of Science</a> in Physical Therapy and the Master of <a>Health Science</a> (MHS). With the transition to the DPT, the program would best equip students to manage the changing needs of the health-care environment and the growing responsibilities of the profession. In its 60-year history, more than 1,500 students, most of whom are still actively involved in the physical therapy profession, have graduated from the Program.</p>
<p>The Program in Occupational Therapy is currently tied for 1st in the nation for &quot;Best Occupational Therapy Schools&quot; according to <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>. Brown also offers a <a>Ph.D.</a> in Social Work in cooperation with the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences and a <a>Master of Public Health</a>. The school was endowed by Bettie Bofinger Brown and named for her husband&nbsp;&#x2014; George Warren Brown&nbsp;&#x2014; a St. Louis philanthropist and co-founder of the <a>Brown Shoe Company</a>. The school is housed within Brown and Goldfarb halls. It has a center for <a>Native American</a> research, as well as acclaimed scholars in <a>social security</a>, health, individual development accounts, etc.</p>
<p>The school's current dean is Edward F. Lawlor.</p>
<h3>Former Schools</h3>
<p>Founded as the Missouri Dental College in 1866, the <a>Washington University School of Dental Medicine</a> was the first dental school west of the Mississippi River and only the sixth dental school in the U.S. The school closed in 1991.</p>
<h2>Museums and library system</h2>
<p> With 14 libraries, the Washington University library system is the largest in the state of Missouri, containing over 4.2 million volumes.

<p><a>left|thumb|260px|Reading room in Anheuser-Busch Hall</a> The <a>Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum</a>, established in 1881, is one of the oldest teaching museums in the country and the first art museum established west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. The collection includes works from 19th, 20th, and 21st century American and European artists, including <a>George Caleb Bingham</a>, <a>Thomas Cole</a>, <a>Pablo Picasso</a>, <a>Max Ernst</a>, <a>Alexander Calder</a>, <a>Jackson Pollock</a>, <a>Rembrandt</a>, <a>Robert Rauschenberg</a>, <a>Barbara Kruger</a>, and <a>Christian Boltanski</a>. Also in the complex is the  Newman Money Museum. In October 2006, the Kemper Art Museum moved from its previous location, Steinberg Hall, into a new facility designed by former faculty member <a>Fumihiko Maki</a>. Interestingly, the new Kemper Art Museum is located directly across from Steinberg Hall, which was Maki's very first commission in 1959.</p>
<h2>Research, Research Centers and Institutes</h2>
<p><a>right|260px|thumb|Brown Hall</a>  Virtually all faculty members at Washington University engage in academic research, offering opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students across the University's 7 schools. Known for its interdisciplinarity and departmental collaboration, most research centers and institutes at Washington University are collaborative efforts between many areas on campus. More than 60% of undergraduates are involved in faculty research across all areas; it is an institutional priority for undergraduates to be allowed to participate in advanced research, which is rather unique among leading private research universities. According to the Center for Measuring University Performance, it is considered to be one of the top 10 private research universities in the nation.  A dedicated Office of Undergraduate Research is located on the <a>Danforth Campus</a> and serves as a resource to post research opportunities, advise students in finding appropriate positions matching their interests, publish undergraduate research journals, and award research grants to make it financially possible to perform research.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2007, $537.5 million was received in total research support, including $444 million in federal obligations. The University has over 150 <a>National Institutes of Health</a> funded inventions, with many of them licensed to private companies. Governmental agencies and non-profit foundations such as the NIH, <a>United States Department of Defense</a>, <a>National Science Foundation</a>, and <a>NASA</a> provide the majority of research grant funding, with Washington University being one of the top recipients in NIH grants from year-to-year. Nearly 80% of NIH grants to institutions in the state of Missouri went to Washington University alone in 2007. Washington University and its Medical School play a large part in the <a>Human Genome Project</a>, where it contributes approximately 25% of the finished sequence. The Genome Sequencing Center has decoded the genome of many animals, plants, and cellular organisms, including the platypus, chimpanzee, cat, and corn.</p>
<p>NASA hosts its Planetary Data System Geosciences Node on the campus of Washington University. Professors, students, and researchers have been very involved with many unmanned missions to Mars. Professor Ray Arvidson has been co-investigator of the Phoenix Rover robotic arm and chair of the Mars Exploration Rover landing site group.</p>
<p>Washington University professor Joseph Lowenstein, with the assistance of several undergraduate students, has been involved in editing, annotating, making a digital archive of the first publication of poet <a>Edmund Spencer</a>'s collective works in 100 years. A large grant from the <a>National Endowment for the Humanities</a> has been given to support this ambitious project centralized at Washington University with support from other colleges in the United States.</p>

<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p><a>right|250px|thumb|Women's Building</a> Washington University has over 200 undergraduate student organizations on campus. Most are funded by the <a>Washington University Student Union</a>, which has a $2 million plus annual budget that is completely student controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including <a>WILD</a> (a semesterly concert in the quad), free copies of the <a>New York Times</a>, <a>USA Today</a>, and the <a>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> through The Collegiate Readership Program; the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series; and the campus television station, <a>WUTV</a> and the <a>radio station</a>, <a>KWUR</a>. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus. Washington University is also home to the National Prestigious Society of Collegiate Jugglers, one of the largest and most talented juggling clubs in the Midwest. There are 12 fraternities and 7 sororities. The Congress of the South 40 (CS40) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board, which operates outside of the SU sphere. CS40's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee of each student living on the South 40.</p>
<p>Many of these organizations and other campus life amenities are housed in the $43 million <a>Danforth University Center</a> on the <a>Danforth Campus</a>, also dedicated in honor of the Danforth family. The building opened on August 11, 2008 and earned <a>LEED</a> Gold certification for its environmentally friendly design.</p>

<h3>Residences</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|260px|The South 40</a></p>
<p>75% of undergraduate students live on campus. Most of the residence halls on campus are located on the <strong>South 40</strong>, named because of its adjacent location on the south side of the <a>Danforth Campus</a> and its size of . It is the location of all the freshman dorms as well as several upperclassman dorms, which are set up in the traditional <a>residential college</a> system. All of the dorms are co-ed. The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Wohl <a>Student Center</a>, the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, <a>University Police</a> Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.</p>
<p>Another group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of <a>Danforth Campus</a>. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p>Washington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's <a>student newspaper</a>, <a><em>Student Life</em></a>, is available for students. <a>KWUR</a> (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. Though KWUR offers streaming content through the Internet, the station only broadcasts at 10&nbsp;watts, and ten in women's <a>volleyball</a> (1989, 1991&#x2013;1996, 2003, 2007, 2009)&nbsp;&#x2013; and 138 <a>UAA</a> titles in 14 different sports. The Athletic Department is headed by John Schael who has served as <a>director of athletics</a> since 1978. The 2000 <a>Division III</a> Central Region winner of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics/Continental Airlines Athletics Director of the Year award, Schael has helped orchestrate the Bears athletics transformation into one of the top departments in Division III. Funding for club sports comes from the Student Union budget, as each club is deemed a campus group.</p>
<p>Washington University is home of <a>Francis Field</a>, site of the <a>1904 Summer Olympics</a>. <a>Francis Field</a> is also home of the <a>Washington University football</a>, soccer, and <a>track and field</a> teams.</p>
