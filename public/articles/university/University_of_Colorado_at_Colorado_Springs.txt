<p>   The <strong>University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</strong> (<strong>UCCS</strong>; formerly <strong>CU-Springs</strong>) is a campus of the <a>University of Colorado System</a>, the <a>state university system</a> of <a>Colorado</a>.</p>
<p>UCCS has about 7,150 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate students, with 18% ethnic minority students and 58% female students.</p>
<p>In 2006, the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> <a>college and university rankings</a> put the UCCS College of Engineering and Applied Science as ranking the fourth-best among <a>public universities</a> and the 16th best overall among <a>bachelor</a> and <a>master's degree</a> <a>engineering</a> schools. <em>U.S. News</em> ranked UCCS as the 32nd in master's universities in the <a>West</a> for the 2009 rankings. For public universities in the Master's Universities-West category it was ranked 6th. It has been ranked in the top ten on that list each year since 2002.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> As early as the 1920s, CU offered classes in the Colorado Springs area at various locations, mostly Colorado College. By the 1960s, however, a permanent campus was desired.</p>
<p><a>Colorado Governor</a> <a>John Arthur Love</a> and <a>Hewlett-Packard Company</a> co-founder <a>David Packard</a> (whose company had a huge presence in the city) led a drive to establish a permanent home for the university. The solution came when George T. Dwire sold the Cragmor Sanatorium property for $1 to the state. </p>
<p>In 1965 UCCS moved to its current location on Austin Bluffs Parkway in the Cragmor neighborhood of northern Colorado Springs. The campus is located at one of the highest parts of the city.</p>
<p>Because of its ties to HP, initial university programs focused on engineering and business, and classes were held in the Cragmor Sanotorium building, what is now Main Hall, and Cragmor Hall, a modern expansion of Main Hall. The first building built exclusively for UCCS, Dwire Hall, was not complete until 1972.</p>
<p>A 1997 community referendum merged Beth-El College of Nursing with UCCS. In recent years, programs such as the Network Information and Space Security Center were added to connect the university with the military to improve <a>national security</a>. Other programs, including the CU Institute for Bioenergetics and the Institute for Science and Space Studies, cast an eye toward the future.</p>
<p>In 2001 UCCS purchased an  building at the corner of Union and Austin Bluffs to house the Beth-El College of Nursing.</p>
<p>While on his campaign trail, Presidential Nominee <a>Barack Obama</a> made a stop on the campus. His agenda was helping senators with current Colorado budget issues and answering questions of Colorado voters.</p>

  <li>Summit Village Expansion (2011?) &ndash; Preliminary plans call for the construction of two additional dormitories adjacent to the current Aspen House, partially removing current Lot 6 to make room for the addition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master plan and future growth</h2>
<p>In 2000, the CU Board of Regents designated UCCS as the CU growth campus. In 2003, the <a>Colorado Legislature</a> approved revisions in the university's statutory role and mission to remove geographic and program restrictions. In 2005, the Regents approved a seven-year plan that calls for the university to add to its base of 7,650 students (Fall 2004), 347 FTE faculty and 254 FTE staff.</p>
<p>The 2006&#x2013;2012 plan calls for growth to 9,100 students with corresponding increases in faculty, staff, programs and campus infrastructure.</p>
<p>In addition to the completion of the recreation center, Dwire Hall renovation, and the third wing of the new science/engineering building, the seven-year plan also calls for the renovation and transition of the old <a>Heller Center</a> on the other side of the bluff that campus sits in front of into a sort of &quot;arts retreat.&quot; This project is expected to cost around $4.4 million. Also, by 2014, two new buildings are in the works for Summit, and by that year the Alpine Village should be built out with three additional buildings across from the current ones.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Mountain Lion logo</a> The school <a>mascot</a> is the <a>mountain lion</a>, with official colors of gold and black, the same de facto <a>school color</a>s of CU-Boulder (actual colors silver and black). </p>
<p>UCCS competes in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> in the <a>Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference</a> (RMAC), fielding teams in <a>men's basketball</a>, <a>women's basketball</a>, women's volleyball, men's cross country, women's cross country, men's indoor track and field, women's indoor track and field, men's outdoor track and field, women's outdoor track and field, men's golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, and women's softball.</p>
<p>In addition to varsity sports, UCCS has a large number of club sports including a dance team and a cheerleading club, cycling, baseball, billiards, fencing, hockey, karate, kendo, kung fu, lacrosse, paintball, racquetball, rugby, tai chi, tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, womans soccer, and an active intramural program. The intramural sports include flag football, ultimate frisbee, outdoor soccer, table tennis, rootbeer pong, volleyball, basketball, billiards, and a 3-point shooting contest. Snowboarding, skiing, rock climbing, bouldering, hiking, mountain biking, trail running, and lesser common slack roping and 4-wheeling are popular student activities at UCCS due to the extreme proximity to <a>Pikes Peak</a>, <a>Garden of the Gods</a>, and the surrounding mountainous terrain. It is not uncommon to see former or current professional or Olympic athletes on campus or training on the nearby trails also with the <a>United States Olympic Training Center</a> in downtown <a>Colorado Springs</a>.</p>
<h3>Athletic facilities</h3>
<p>Varsity basketball and volleyball are currently played in the Lions Den gymnasium at the University Center, which seats 400 and is the smallest venue in all Division II schools, the size of many smaller high school gymnasiums. With the recent success of men&#x2019;s basketball, achieving the best record in UCCS history, amongst other things, led to an acceleration of plans to replace the facility with mounting pressure from students and athletes alike. A temporary fix that was completed in early 2007 cost $40,000 and only slightly expanded and upgraded seating. Attempts at separating seating sections did not significantly help in alleviating overcrowding where students are often turned away at popular events. There also exists major problems with the lack of locker room space for use by the athletic teams during competitions. $2 million of CU Presidential Initiative funds were directed towards the construction of a new athletic field house. &#x201c;Intercollegiate athletics is an important facet of student life and the campus experience, and we&#x2019;re pleased to be able to help with a desperately needed new home for Mountain Lion student-athletics,&#x201d; said CU President Hank Brown.</p>
<p>After projected costs for the field house more than doubled, the university decided that a permanent events center would be a better use of funds amid plans for a major sports arena to be built in less than 10 years. The events center to be completed by January 2010 will seat about 1,200 to 1,400 sporting event fans and have the ability to hold more conferences, camps, and convocation events. The new events center will not however, have an indoor track, weight room, as well as other athletic amenities promised with the field house.</p>
<p>An agreement between the university and the <a>Colorado Springs Christian School</a> nearby lead to the construction of a professional quality soccer and football field at the recently built 4-diamonds sports complex that also consists of three softball fields which are sometimes contracted for use by high school and little league teams. The varsity soccer and softball teams practice and compete at these facilities as well as club and intramural sports.</p>
<p>The varsity cross country, track and field, and golf teams find practice and competition spaces mostly off-campus often at nearby colleges, high schools, or other facilities and locations if required.</p>
<p>A brand new Student Recreation Center was completed in August and September 2007 which houses the Recreation Department overseeing club and intramural sports. The Recreation Center consists of a pool and hot tub, gymnasium, indoor jogging track, bouldering wall, aerobics room, and a cardiovascular and weight lifting floor as well as a small smoothie shop. The Recreation Center was certified as a LEED-Gold building in early 2009 by the U.S. Green Building Council. This was the first LEED-certified building in the campus' history and the first LEED-Gold public building in Southern Colorado. It is believed to be the second recreation center in the U.S. to receive LEED-Gold designation.</p>
