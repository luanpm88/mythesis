At first it offered <a>education</a> in grades 1 through 12 to prepare <a>freedmen</a> for higher education; by 1931 the <a>high school</a>-level <a>Academy</a> was disbanded, leaving Knoxville College a four-year institution of higher education. Knoxville College is a <a>United Negro College Fund</a> member school.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1862, the Reverend O.S. McKee, under the auspices of the Freedmen's Mission of the <a>United Presbyterian Church</a>, founded the <a>McKee School</a> in <a>Nashville</a>, the first organized school for Negroes in Tennessee. The church soon established similar <a>missionary schools</a> for <a>blacks</a> in <a>Mississippi</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>, <a>Alabama</a>, and <a>Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1872, the <a>General Assembly</a> of the church resolved to discontinue support of the schools in order to establish a college where blacks might prepare for ministerial and teaching careers. Two years later, the church selected Knoxville to be the site of the college as the black residents of the city expressed interest in education and the city was strategically located between existent centers of black education, Nashville and <a>Atlanta</a>.</p>
<p>In 1875, Knoxville College began operation in a former freedmen's elementary school. The following year, the college moved to a permanent location on a hill northwest of and overlooking downtown Knoxville. In 1878, only 174 of the student population studied on a level equivalent to or above that of a college freshman.</p>
<p>During the 1880s, black legislators obtained state scholarships for military cadets at the college. During 1890&#x2013;1909, the college served as the Industrial Department for black students of the <a>University of Tennessee</a> in order to acquire funds for the scientific and industrial education of blacks, authorized by the <a>Second Morrill Act</a>.</p>
<p>In 1914, the <a>College of Arts and Sciences</a> was established. From 1920 to 1950, the <a>normal school</a> was emphasized giving to the school the distinction of being the leading supplier of teachers to black schools in <a>East Tennessee</a>. Since 1950, the College of Arts and Sciences has been emphasized including the implementation of community service programs and dramatic productions.</p>
<p>In 1954, the college charter was amended in order to allow formally the admission of white students, although the children of some white faculty members had previously attended the college. In 1957, the college was one of the first group of predominantly black institutions admitted to full membership in the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS). In 1979, the church deeded the title for the college property to the <a>Board of Trustees</a> of the college.</p>
<h3>Accreditation loss and legal issues</h3>
<p>In 1997, the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> withdrew Knoxville College's <a>accreditation</a>.  In August 2005, the Board of Directors fired the college president, Barbara Hatton.</p>
<p>In January 2010 Knoxville College hired Dr. Dr. Horace A. Judson as the interim president. Dr. Judson has implemented a new strategic plan that involves Six Strategic Initiatives for the college, which are:  1. Regain Accreditation 2. Achieve Fiscal Stability 3. Develop Academic Program Distinctiveness 4. Develop a Department of Enrollment Management 5. Develop a Quality Student-Centered Living and Learning Environment 6. Establish New Relationships and Strengthen Former Ones among Key Constituents.</p>
<p>Dr. Judson served as president of Plattsburgh State University of New York from 1994 to 2003 and as president of Grambling State University, a historically black college in Louisiana, from 2004 until fall 2009.</p>
<h3><em>The Tennessean</em> newspaper article</h3>
<p>The July 6, 2006 edition of <em><a>The Tennessean</a></em> newspaper, based in <a>Nashville, Tennessee</a>, reported a reversal of fortune. The article outlined that a year earlier, the college was down to about 130 students, couldn't pay its faculty or electric bills and was drowning in debt. However, according to the report, enrollment was rebounding with more than 400 students accepted for the 2006 Fall semester from more than 700 applicants. The faculty was being paid, the lights are back on, and the college's debts had been cut by about two-thirds, down more than $2 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, let me tell you it's the best problem in the world&quot;, Will Minter, an <a>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> official helping as a development strategist and fundraiser for the college, said of enrollment growth. &quot;I'm happy to have one where we're overloaded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are miles ahead of where we were a year ago&quot;, said Ronald Damper, a Chicago businessman and chairman of Knoxville College's Board of Trustees. &quot;We've had outstanding success in getting assistance from a number of people to get us to this point. The community has embraced the college.&quot;</p>
<p>The Knoxville College Alumni Association, according to the article, was reportedly in the middle of a $1 million fundraising effort, while the college was engaged in a $2.5 million &quot;Road to Success&quot; campaign. Administrators said the college had paid down $2 million in debt, but still was $1 million behind. </p>
<h3>Dormitory fire</h3>
<p>On February 19, 2007, Colston Hall (men's dormitory) caught fire. As a result of the fire two rooms were destroyed with smoke damage throughout the building. Knoxville Fire Department investigators determined that the fire was accidental and was not due to an electrical problem.</p>
