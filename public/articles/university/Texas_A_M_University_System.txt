<p><strong>The Texas A&amp;M University System</strong> is one of the largest systems of higher education in the <a>United States</a>. Through a statewide network of eleven <a>universities</a>, eight <a>state</a> <a>agencies</a> and a comprehensive <a>health science</a> center, the Texas A&amp;M System educates over 100,000 students, conducts more than $600 million in research and reaches another 11 million people through service each year. The system's flagship institution is <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a> in <a>College Station, Texas</a>, which opened in 1876 as the <a>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</a> (the letters &quot;A&amp;M&quot; no longer have any explicit meaning, but are retained as a link to that university's past). New system universities are planned to be constructed in <a>Killeen, Texas</a> (Texas A&amp;M University &#x2013; Central Texas) and <a>San Antonio, Texas</a> (<a>Texas A&amp;M University &#x2013; San Antonio</a>). The system's headquarters are located at the College Station Business Park at 200 Technology Way in <a>College Station</a>.</p>
<h2>Universities</h2>
<p>The nine universities of the Texas A&amp;M University System provide a wide range of opportunities for educational, research, leadership and service activities, from the fifth-largest university in the nation &#x2014; Texas A&amp;M University at College Station &#x2014; to other, regional universities throughout Texas. <a>thumb|right|Texas A&amp;M University System campuses in Texas.</a> [[Image:TexasAMHirshfieldMooreHouse.JPG|thumb|[[Henry Hirshfeld House and Cottage|Hirshfeld-Moore House]], the governmental relations center of the Texas A&amp;M University System, in <a>Austin</a>]]</p>

<h4>Branches</h4>
<p><a>Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston</a> and <a>Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar</a> are branches of Texas A&amp;M University, meaning students study identical curricula and receive identical degrees from <strong>Texas A&amp;M University</strong>. Texas A&amp;M's two branches are separate campuses of the same university. When transferring between branches, students also keep grades for courses they have taken (whereas students transferring from any other university, including others in the A&amp;M system, only receive pass/fail credit for transfer coursework); this is important for <a>GPA</a> considerations. The process involves filling out a change of major form to switch departments between campuses, thereby not requiring any sort of application. Emergency cases are considered, such as after <a>Hurricane Ike</a>, many Galveston students finished the semester at College Station. Texas A&amp;M University at <a>Koriyama</a> was a branch campus from May 1990 until its closure in August 1995 due to lack of funding.</p>
<h2>Agencies</h2>
<p>With a direct presence in all 254 Texas counties, A&amp;M System agencies offer research and service to the state's citizens. The agencies focused on addressing and improving the social, economic, educational, health and environmental conditions of Texans.</p>

<h2>Health Science Center</h2>
<p>The <a>Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center</a> is a premier assembly of colleges devoted to educating health professionals and researchers of extraordinary competence and integrity. Its faculty, staff and students are united by a belief that all people &#x2013; regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, or culture &#x2013; deserve the benefits of compassionate care, superior science and exceptional health education.</p>
<p>Established in 1999, the HSC reaches across all parts of Texas through its six components: Baylor College of Dentistry at Dallas; the College of Medicine at College Station and Temple; the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Dallas, College Station and Houston; the Institute of Biosciences and Technology at Houston; the School of Rural Public Health at College Station; and the latest addition, the Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy at Kingsville. Southern regions of the state also are further served by the Coastal Bend Health Education Center, which covers the 19-county region surrounding Corpus Christi and Kingsville, and the South Texas Center at McAllen.</p>
<p>The HSC received full accreditation in December 2002 from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master&#x2019;s, doctoral and professional degrees. Its components are accredited by accrediting organizations specific to their areas.</p>
