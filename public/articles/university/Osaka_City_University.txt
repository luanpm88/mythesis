<p> </p>
<p>, abbreviated to , is a <a>municipal university</a> in <a>Japan</a>. It is located in <a>Sumiyoshi-ku</a>, <a>Osaka City</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Its root was founded in 1880, as Osaka Commercial Training Institute () with the donations by the local merchants. It developed into Osaka Commercial School in 1885, then was municipalized in 1889. Osaka City was defeated in a battle to draw the Second National Commercial College (the winner was <a>Kobe</a> City), so the city authorities decided to establish a municipal commercial college without any aid from the national budget. It was the beginning of the School's hard history.</p>
<p>In 1901 the school was reorganized into Osaka Municipal Commercial College (), later authorized under Specialized School Order in 1904. The college had grand brick buildings around <a>Taish&#x014d; period</a> - the most prosperous days both of the school and of the city.</p>

<p>In 1928 the college developed into Osaka University of Commerce (), the first municipal university in Japan. The city mayor, Dr. Hajime Seki (, 1873&#x2013;1935) declared the spirit of the municipal university, that <em>it should not simply copy the national universities</em> and that it should become a place for research with a background of urban activities in Osaka. But, contrary to his words, the University was removed to the most rural part of the city by 1935. The first president of the University was a liberalist, so the campus gradually became what was thought to be &quot;a den of the Reds (Marxists)&quot;. During <a>World War II</a>, the Marxists and the socialists in the University were arrested (about 50 to 80 members) soon after the liberal president died. The campus was evacuated and used by the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>After the war, the campus was wholly occupied by U.S. Army (Camp Sakai), so a number of students became anti-American fighters and &quot;worshipers&quot; of the <a>Soviet Union</a>. The campus was given back to the University, partly in 1952, and thoroughly in 1955. In 1949, during the occupation, the University was merged (with other 2 municipal colleges) into <strong>Osaka City University</strong>, under Japan's new educational systems.</p>

<p>At first OCU had five faculties (Business / Economics / Law and Literature / Science and Engineering / Home Economics).&lt;br /&gt; In 1953, the Faculty of Law and Literature was divided into two faculties.&lt;br /&gt; In 1955, Osaka City Medical University was merged and became Medical School.&lt;br /&gt; In 1959, the Faculty of Science and Engineering was divided into two faculties.&lt;br /&gt; In 1975, the Faculty of Home Economics was reorganized into the Faculty of Human Life Science.&lt;br /&gt; In 2003, the faculty members of the Institute for Economic Research (established in 1928) were transferred to establish the Graduate School of Creative Cities.&lt;br /&gt; In 2006, the Institute for Economic Research was reorganized into the Urban Research Plaza. </p>
<p>In September 1950, Osaka City was attacked by Typhoon Jane and the city budget was heavily injured. In addition, a taxation reform (advised by Carl Sumner Shoup) deprived the city of large income from eating houses. So OCU gradually became a mere burden to the city.</p>
