<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of California, Riverside</strong>, commonly known as <strong>UCR</strong> or <strong>UC Riverside</strong>, is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> and one of the ten general campuses of the <a>University of California</a> system. UCR is consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the United States The main campus sits on  in a suburban district of , <a>United States</a>, with a branch campus of  in <a>Palm Desert</a>. Founded in 1907 as the <a>UC Citrus Experiment Station</a>, Riverside pioneered research in <a>biological pest control</a> and the use of <a>growth regulators</a> responsible for extending the <a>citrus</a> growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on <a>citrus diversity</a> and <a>entomology</a>, as well as <a>science fiction</a> and <a>photography</a>, are located at Riverside.</p>
<p>UCR's undergraduate <a>College of Letters and Science</a> opened in 1954. The <a>Regents of the University of California</a> declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000&nbsp;students by 2015, more than $730&nbsp;million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999. Plans are underway to open California's first new research-based public <a>medical school</a> in 40 years there by 2012.</p>
<p><em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> ranked UCR 16th in the United States in terms of social mobility, research and community service, while <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> ranked UCR's undergraduate program 94th in the nation (out of 368 colleges) based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors. <em>U.S. News</em> ranks UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving <a>Pell Grant</a>s (42&nbsp;percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation. UCR's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a &quot;campus of choice&quot; for minority students, including <a>LGBT</a> students. In 2005, UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option.</p>
<p>UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the <a>Big West Conference</a> of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) <a>Division I</a>.  Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of <a>Box Springs Mountain</a>. The UCR women's basketball team won back to back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:A Gary Anderson Graduate School of Managment.JPG|thumb|left|The original UC Citrus Experiment Station which now houses the [[A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management]].]]</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, <a>Southern California</a> was a major producer of <a>citrus</a>, the region's primary <a>agricultural export</a>. The industry developed from the country's first <a>navel orange</a> trees, planted in <a>Riverside</a> in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the <a>UC Regents</a> established the <a>UC Citrus Experiment Station</a> (CES) on February 14, 1907, on  of land on the east slope of <a>Mount Rubidoux</a> in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in <a>fertilization</a>, <a>irrigation</a> and <a>crop</a> improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site,  near <a>Box Springs Mountain</a>.</p>
<p>The 1944 passage of the <a>GI Bill</a> during <a>World War II</a> set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many <a>UC Berkeley</a> alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered <a>liberal arts college</a> next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature. Governor <a>Earl Warren</a> signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2&nbsp;million for initial campus construction.</p>
<p>Gordon S. Watkins, <a>dean</a> of the College of Letters and Science at <a>UCLA</a>, became the first <a>provost</a> of the new college at Riverside. Initially conceived of as a small college devoted to the liberal arts, he ordered the campus built for a maximum of 1,500&nbsp;students and recruited many young junior faculty to fill teaching positions. He presided at its opening with 65&nbsp;faculty and 127&nbsp;students on February 14, 1954, remarking, &quot;Never have so few been taught by so many.&quot;</p>
<p>UCR's enrollment exceeded 1,000&nbsp;students by the time <a>Clark Kerr</a> became president of the UC system in 1958. Anticipating a &quot;tidal wave&quot; in enrollment growth required by the <a>baby boom</a> generation, Kerr developed the <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> and the Regents designated Riverside a general <a>university</a> campus in 1959. UCR's first <a>chancellor</a>, <a>Herman Theodore Spieth</a>, oversaw the beginnings of the school's transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5,000&nbsp;students. UCR's second chancellor, <a>Ivan Hinderaker</a> led the campus through the era of the <a>free speech movement</a> and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside. According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for <a>smog</a> after the mayor asked Governor <a>Ronald Reagan</a> to declare the south coast air basin a <a>disaster area</a> in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25&nbsp;percent through 1979. Hinderaker's development of innovative programs in <a>business administration</a> and <a>biomedical sciences</a> created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Entrance along University Avenue. The Arts Building is visible in the background. (2007)</a> In the 1990s, the UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications, now known as &quot;Tidal Wave II&quot;. The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6.3&nbsp;percent, the fastest in the UC system, and anticipated 19,900&nbsp;students at UCR by 2010. By 1995, African American, American Indian, and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30&nbsp;percent of the UCR student body, the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time. The 1997 implementation of <a>Proposition 209</a>&mdash;which banned the use of <a>affirmative action</a> by state agencies&mdash;reduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR.</p>
<p>With UCR scheduled for dramatic population growth, efforts have been made to increase its popular and academic recognition. The students voted for a fee increase to move UCR athletics into <a>NCAA Division I</a> standing in 1998. Proposals to establish a law school, a medical school, and a school of public policy at UCR have been in development since the 1990s. In June 2006, UCR received its largest gift, 15.5&nbsp;million from two local couples, in trust towards building its medical school. The Regents formally approved UCR&#x2019;s medical school proposal in 2006. Projected to be completed by 2012, it will be the first new medical school in 40&nbsp;years built in California.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> <img>  UCR's main campus sits at an elevation of  to  near <a>Box Springs Mountain</a>, 3&nbsp;miles (5&nbsp;km) east of downtown <a>Riverside</a>, and comprises  divided into eastern and western areas by the <a>State Route 60</a> freeway.</p>
<p>East Campus, occupying approximately , hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the <a>UC Citrus Experiment Station</a>, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the <a>architecture</a> of the major buildings followed the <a>Mission Revival</a> style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of <a>Southern California</a>.</p>
<p>After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: <a>Bourns Hall</a>, completed in 1995; the Humanities &amp; Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998. The Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls were completed in 2000, and the Arts building was completed in 2001. The first phase of a new Commons was completed in 2007, and phase II is in development. Other ongoing projects include a new CHASS Instructional and Research Center and Students Academic Support Services Building. Since 1999, more than $730&nbsp;million has been invested in construction projects.</p>
<h3>Palm Desert graduate center</h3>
<p>The Richard J. Heckmann International Center for Entrepreneurial Management was founded in <a>Palm Desert</a> in 2001. After the  <a>Coachella Valley Agricultural Research Station</a>, it is UCR's second institutional presence in the <a>Coachella Valley</a>. Initially funded by a $6&nbsp;million gift from Richard J. Heckmann, a <a>water treatment</a> entrepreneur, the institution was planned as a teaching and research center of the <a>A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management</a>. The center encourages local <a>entrepreneurship</a> through the Coachella Valley Angel Network, an <a>angel investment network</a>. A further investment of $10&nbsp;million from the State of California and a donation of  of land from the City of Palm Desert allowed for the opening of an expanded graduate center on April 15, 2005, adjacent to the <a>California State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus</a>. The center is also home to university researchers in <a>conservation biology</a>, <a>technology transfer</a> and <a>Native American studies</a>. Master's level instruction in <a>business management</a> and <a>creative writing</a> is available at the center.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As a campus of the <a>University of California</a> system, UCR is governed by a <a>Board of Regents</a> and administered by a president. The current president is <a>Mark Yudof</a>, and the <a>administrative head</a> of UCR is Timothy P. White. UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.</p>
<p>UCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the <a>College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences</a>, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The <a>College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences</a>, founded in 1960, incorporated the <a>CES</a> as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974. Comprising the professional schools are the <a>Graduate School of Education</a>, founded in 1968, and the <a>A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management</a>, founded in 1970. UCR is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in <a>creative writing</a> and <a>public policy</a> and one of three UCs (along with <a>Berkeley</a> and <a>Irvine</a>) to offer an undergraduate degree in <a>business administration</a>. Through its <a>Division of Biomedical Sciences</a>, founded in 1974, UCR offers the Thomas Haider medical degree program in collaboration with <a>UCLA</a>. A new BA program in <a>bagpipes</a> was inaugurated in 2007.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>  <a>Institutional rankings</a> of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, in the 2010 issue of <em><a>US News and World Report</a>'s</em> &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot;, UCR was ranked in the top tier (94th) among national universities; criteria include peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty and financial resources. In the 2007&nbsp;edition of the <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em> college rankings, UCR ranked 15th among national universities. The <em>Washington Monthly</em> assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (e.g., percentage of Pell Grant recipients who graduate), academic quality (e.g., percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs), and community service. According to the <a>Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index</a> published by <em>Academic Analytics</em> in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors. Since 1997, more than 110&nbsp;UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the <a>American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>. Over the course of UCR's history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>, and more than 50 have received <a>Guggenheim Fellowship</a>s.]]</p>
<p>UCR operated under a $435&nbsp;million budget in fiscal year 2005&#x2013;06. The state government provided $153&nbsp;million, student fees accounted for $111&nbsp;million, the federal government financed $84&nbsp;million, and $45&nbsp;million came from university sales and services. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $18&nbsp;million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1&nbsp;billion in California. Total research <a>expenditure</a>s at Riverside are significantly concentrated in <a>agricultural science</a>, accounting for 53&nbsp;percent of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002. Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of <a>gibberellic acid</a> allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months. It also administers six reserves of the <a>University of California Natural Reserve System</a>. UCR recently announced a partnership with <a>China Agricultural University</a> to launch a new center in <a>Beijing</a>, which will study ways to respond to the country's growing environmental issues.</p>
<h3>Libraries and collections</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Tom&#x00e1;s Rivera Library (2003)</a> <a>thumb|left|Raymond L. Orbach Science Library (2007)</a> Total <a>library</a> collections at UCR comprise more than 2&nbsp;million volumes, 14,017&nbsp;electronic journals, 23,000&nbsp;serial subscriptions, and 1.7&nbsp;million microformats. Two large, four-story libraries house most of the physical collections. The  Rivera library was constructed in 1954 and named after <a>Tom&#x00e1;s Rivera</a> in 1985. It seats a capacity of 956 and houses general humanities and social science collections, as well as special collections, including the world's largest collection of <a>science fiction</a>, <a>horror</a> and <a>fantasy</a> literature, the 110,000-volume <a>Eaton Collection</a>. The Rivera Library also hosts the only <a>U.S. Patent and Trademark Depository</a> based on a UC campus. The  Raymond L. Orbach Science Library, built in 1998, seats a capacity of 1,360 and houses 533,000&nbsp;volumes in the physical, natural, agricultural, biomedical, engineering and computer sciences, with special strengths in the areas of citrus and sub-tropical horticulture, entomology, and arid lands agriculture. On November 3, 2009, the Science library was officially renamed the Raymond L. Orbach Science Library in honor of former Chancellor Raymond L. Orbach. Smaller libraries include the Media and Cultural Library, the Music Library, and a branch digital library in Palm Desert. The UCR Library is one of 116&nbsp;members of the <a>Association of Research Libraries</a>, and is ranked 93rd in this group. The <a>Herbarium</a> houses more than 110,000&nbsp;dried plant specimens from across the Western hemisphere. UCR is also home to 40 acres (162,000 m&#x00b2;) of botanical gardens containing more than 3,500 plant species from around the world. The Gardens are located in the eastern foothills of the Box Springs Mountain on the University of California, Riverside campus. Over four miles (6&nbsp;km) of trails wind through many microclimates and hilly terrain. The <a>Entomology Research Museum</a> contains more than three million insect specimens, with particular strengths in <a>Hymenoptera</a>, <a>Chalcidoidea</a>, <a>Aphelinidae</a>, <a>Thysanoptera</a> and <a>Meloidae</a>. The <a>UCR/California Museum of Photography</a> and Sweeney Art Gallery house UCR's primary art collections. The UCR/CMP includes the world's largest holding of vintage <a>stereograph</a>s, one of the three great public collections of photographic apparatus in the US, and the University Print Collection of contemporary and historical images by over 1000 photographers. Located adjacent to the UCR/CMP, the Sweeney Art Gallery holds approximately 650&nbsp;unique works, with especially strong collections from the <a>modern</a> to <a>contemporary</a> periods, including pieces by <a>Alexander Calder</a>, <a>Roy Lichtenstein</a>, <a>Millard Sheets</a> and <a>Kara Walker</a>.</p>
<h3>Admissions, enrollment and retention</h3>
<p>  Historically, UCR has accepted all students who qualify for admission to the UC system based on a 3.0&nbsp;minimum <a>grade point average</a> (GPA) and average <a>SAT</a> scores of 470 on each of the math, English and writing tests. Among freshmen admitted for the fall of 2009, high school GPAs averaged 3.31, SAT scores averaged 1666, and <a>ACT</a> Composite scores averaged 24. Among freshmen enrolled for the fall of 2010, the middle 50 percent range SAT score was 930-1170 out of a total of 1600 (math and reading only). UCR admitted 78.3&nbsp;percent of 24,800&nbsp;first-year applicants in 2009. As most other UC schools typically receive more applicants than there are spots available, the UC refers applicants who met minimum UC admission requirements but do not qualify for the more selective campuses in the system to UC Riverside and <a>UC Merced</a>. Enrollment in the fall of 2007 totaled 17,187&nbsp;students, 15,041&nbsp;undergraduates and 2,146&nbsp;postgraduates. In 2007, <em><a>U.S. News</a></em> ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving <a>Pell Grants</a> (42&nbsp;percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation. However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39&nbsp;percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the <a>National Center for Education Statistics</a>, making the campus a model for successful approaches to <a>diversity</a> in higher education.]]</p>
<p>Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the <em><a>Los Angeles Times</a></em> and <em><a>New York Times</a></em> to run stories lauding UCR as a &quot;campus of choice&quot; for minority students. UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option in 2005. In 2008 the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> student survey ranked UCR sixth in terms of low student happiness, although it also listed UCR as a &quot;Best Western College.&quot; While 70&nbsp;percent of students are non-white, there is a tendency for the different ethnic groups to self-segregate, and racial tension is not unheard of, according to some students.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>[[Image:Sunset, UCR.jpg|thumb|Sunset over UCR [[residence hall]]s]] UCR's <a>residence hall</a>s consist of three structures&mdash;Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills&mdash;which as of 2002 housed 2,930&nbsp;students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus <a>apartment complex</a>es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Greenock/Summer Ridge, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959&nbsp;students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls. About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus.</p>
<p>Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include <em>Unete a Mundo</em>, for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a <a>gender-neutral</a> community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.</p>
<h3>Student organizations and activities</h3>
<p>UCR hosts 281&nbsp;registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues. ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 20&nbsp;elected officers, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees. ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.</p>
<p>[[Image:BigC Box Springs Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|In August 1955, students constructed a  by  concrete &#x201c;C&#x201c; on the western slope of the [[Box Springs Mountain]].]] </p>
<p>Of the registered student groups, 40 are <a>fraternities and sororities</a>. Ten men's fraternities belong to the <a>North-American Interfraternity Conference</a>; six women's sororities belong to the <a>National Panhellenic Conference</a>; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the <a>National Multicultural Greek Council</a>, and two others fall under the campus <a>Raza</a> Assembly and are unique to UCR.  Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted. Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000&nbsp;hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year. Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through <a>UCR Hillel</a>.</p>
<p>Student media organizations include <em>The Highlander</em> student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, the Highlander remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however the Highlander is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue. In 2003, the Highlander published a comic depicting a stereotypical <a>Asian American</a> graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford. Other student news publications on campus include the <em>Asian Community Times, Indian Time, Nuestra Cosa, Queeriosity</em>, and the <em>X-Factor Student Newspaper</em>. UCR broadcasts over <a>radio</a> as <a>KUCR</a> at 88.3&nbsp;FM. The station programs a variety of independent music, news and commentary.</p>
<p>On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Student Film Festival, International Film Festival, World Fest, Welcome Week, Homecoming and Spring Splash.</p>
<p>Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a &quot;party school&quot; stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.</p>
<p>The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|UCR's school mascot, known as Scotty the bear</a> UCR's <a>varsity team</a>s compete in the <a>Big West Conference</a> of <a>NCAA Division I</a>. Programs include men and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from <a>NCAA Division II</a> in 2000.  In December 2008, the UCR women's basketball team upset the #16-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores.</p>
<p>In 2005 the women's soccer team competed in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In 2007, UCR's baseball team won their first Big West championship and reached the Division I postseason for the second time since 2003, and the cross country team sent its first two athletes to the national championships. <a>Football</a> was played until 1975, and the team won two <a>CCAA</a> championships before the sport was discontinued because of low attendance and in anticipation of the impact of <a>Title IX</a> regulations.</p>
<p>The volleyball and basketball teams play home games in the <a>Student Recreation Center</a> (SRC), which seats 3,168. The baseball team competes at the <a>Riverside Sports Complex</a>, just off campus at the corner of Blaine and Rustin streets. UCR graduate <a>Troy Percival</a> personally built UCR's baseball clubhouse to <a>major league</a> quality standards. Softball is played at the Amy S. Harrison Field, named after a UCR graduate who donated $300,000 towards its upgrade in 2004. Adjacent to the softball field are the soccer and track fields. The soccer field was resurfaced with <a>artificial turf</a> in 2007, but the track field remains run-down. UCR has not hosted a track and field meet in five years because of the condition of the field. UCR's Karate Club is organized under the auspices of the American <a>JKA</a> Karate Association, an independent, national karate organization hosted at UCR. It annually holds the <a>Shotokan</a> Karate Championships competition in the SRC. A student club also competes in men's soccer.</p>
<p>In 1954, UCR's founding class adopted the name &quot;Highlanders&quot;, reflecting the campus' high altitude. After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998, the bear mascot was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious. The new &quot;Scotty&quot; featured a half-blue face in homage to <a>William Wallace</a>, the subject of the movie <a>Braveheart</a>. In line with the <a>Scottish</a> motif, UCR assembles a <a>bagpipe</a> band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events. The blue and gold <a>tartan</a> worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California. For the women's basketball team's first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006, UCR sent 22&nbsp;members of the pipe band to play at halftime.</p>
<h3>National Championship Teams (Division II)</h3>
