<h2>Principles</h2>

<h3>Mission statement</h3>
<p>&quot;Manchester College respects the infinite worth of every individual and graduates persons of ability and conviction who draw upon their education and faith to lead principled, productive, and compassionate lives that improve the human condition.&quot;</p>
<h3>Values statement</h3>
<p>&quot;As a primarily undergraduate, residential, liberal arts community rooted in the tradition of the Church of the Brethren, Manchester College values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning</strong>, because high academic expectations in an environment combining liberal arts and professional preparation equip graduates to live healthy, productive, and principled lives;</li>
  <li><strong>Faith</strong>, because our diverse faiths call us to make the world a kinder and better place, establish justice, build peace amid strife, and model lives of agape (selfless love), tikkun olam (repairing a broken world), and salam (peace);</li>
  <li><strong>Service</strong>, because committing self in service to others connects faith with action and abilities with convictions;</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong>, because honesty and trust are the foundations of teaching and learning, enriching, enduring relationships, and strong communities;</li>
  <li><strong>Diversity</strong>, because understanding differences develops respect for ethnic, cultural, and religious pluralism; an international consciousness; and an appreciation for the infinite worth of every person; and</li>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>, because a positive community sharpens self-identity, promotes acceptance of the demands of responsible citizenship, and transforms conflict into mutual respect.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>  Manchester College was founded in <a>Roanoke, Indiana</a>, as the Roanoke Classical Seminary in 1860 by the <a>United Brethren Church</a>. David N. Howe served as the last president of Roanoke Classical Seminary, which was moved to North Manchester to become North Manchester [Manchester] College. He served as Manchester College's first president from 1889&#x2013;1894 and is known as the founder. The school was renamed Manchester College in 1889 when it moved to North Manchester. In 1932, Manchester merged with Mount Morris College of <a>Mount Morris, Illinois</a>, a <a>Methodist</a> seminary founded in 1839. Manchester is a college of the <a>Church of the Brethren</a>.  </p>
<p>The Peace Studies Institute and Program for Conflict Resolution - the first undergraduate <a>peace studies</a> major in the U.S., was established at Manchester in 1948. The program was chaired by <a>Kenneth Brown</a> from 1980 until 2005.</p>

<h3>Department of History and Political Science</h3>
<p>The Department of History and Political Science is one of the oldest and most prestigious programs of study at Manchester College, housing the Mock Trial and Model United Nations organizations.  Well-known graduates include <a>G. John Ikenberry</a>, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at <a>Princeton University</a>'s <a>Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</a>, and co-faculty director of the Princeton Project on National Security; and <a>Steven Shull</a>, '65, University Research Professor at the <a>University of New Orleans</a>.
