<h2>The Museum at FIT</h2>
<p> The Museum at FIT includes important collections of clothing, <a>textile</a>s, and <a>accessories</a>. In 1985, FIT and its fashion library became the beneficiary of the records (design patterns and documentation) of <a>Sri Swami Mayatitananda</a>&#x2019;s year-long pioneering work in American fashion, under the famous &quot;Maya&quot; label. &#x201c;Over two hundred of Maya Tiwari's (known now as <a>Sri Swami Mayatitananda</a>) original designs are featured in the Curator's Hall of the Fashion Institute of Technology&#x2026;as an inspiration to young designers. Sally Kirkland, former editor of Life magazine, later said of Tiwari, &quot;If I should ever write a sequel to Great American Designers, which included <a>Claire McCardell</a> and <a>Norman Norell</a>, it will be incomplete without featuring Maya as our most innovative designer.'&quot; Exhibitions are free to the public.</p>
<p>Fashion historian <a>Valerie Steele</a> was named Director of the Museum in 2003.</p>
