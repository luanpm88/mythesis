<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>The establishment of CSUN began in 1952 with the state proposal of a new satellite campus for Los Angeles State College (Now known as <a>California State University, Los Angeles</a>). Thanks to Valley advocates, state officials decided in favor of a valley campus (originally planned in Baldwin Hills on 1955).</p>
<h3>1972-1988</h3>
<p>The college officially names itself California State University - Northridge on June 1972. and the average SAT score was 926.  Seventy-four  percent of incoming freshmen required remediation in either English, or math or both. Nearly eight in 10 CSUN students rate the university's quality of instruction as good or excellent, and the same share say CSUN was their first choice of a university to attend. </p>
<p>The Roland Tseng College of Extended Learning is a division within the university aimed at addressing the educational needs of mid career professionals. The college develops and offers study opportunities which are designed to ensure that the individuals, communities and organizations served by the university achieve their lifelong learning goals.</p>
<p>CSUN's Chicana and <a>Chicano Studies</a> Department is the largest in California.</p>

  <li>The <a>CSUN Botanic Garden</a> is located in the southeast quad (<em>near Zelzah &amp; Nordoff</em>).  It is part of the Biology Department for university curriculum, and also a regionally important demonstration <a>garden</a> and educational resource for the community.  It has new focus projects for:
    <ol>
      <li>Plants usable for regionally local <a>sustainable landscaping</a> using <a>sustainable gardening</a> techniques</li>
      <li>Studying and 'planting' <a>ethnobotany</a> insights and links.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>One of the few remaining <a>historic</a> (circa 1920s) <a>orange</a> <a>groves</a> is thriving on southeastern campus quad. The citrus industry was formerly had groves covering much of the <a>San Fernando Valley</a>. The rows of large eucalyptus trees, historic windbreaks for agricultural fields from the late 19th century, are found towering over the perimeters of the campus, surviving planners developing campus expansions with valor.</li>
  <li>The Robotics program features a <a>FIRST</a> robot designed by Team 599, the Robot Doctors or RoboDox of nearby <a>Granada Hills High School</a> known as the D.O.C.T.O.R.</li>
  <li>The &quot;CSUN Sculpture&quot; was designed by artist John Banks, in 1976 while in the school's Fine Arts Dept. The sculpture was created so that travelers approaching the campus from the east, west, and north streets will see the abstract <a>sculpture</a> at the edge of the historic orange grove on the northwest corner of Nordhoff Street and Zelzah Avenue. It can be read from these directions as the <em>CSUN</em> acronym identifying the university. Being an '<a>impossible shape</a>,' it's a purely abstract aesthetic form when seen from the campus amongst the orange trees. It's becoming iconic.</li>
