<p> <strong>John Rogers</strong> (January 11, 1630&#x2014;July 12, 1684) was an <a>English</a> academic in early <a>Colonial America</a>.  Eldest son of minister <a>Nathaniel Rogers</a>, he was born in <a>Coggeshall</a>, a small town in <a>Essex</a>, and immigrated to <a>New England</a> with his family in 1636.  In 1649, at age 19, in the recent settlement of Cambridge (known as Newe Towne until 1638), he earned a <a>B.A.</a> from <a>Harvard College</a> which, only seven years earlier, in 1642, had graduated its first class of students.  In 1652, following an additional three years of study, he received an <a>M.A.</a> and, in 1660, married Elizabeth Denison of <a>Ipswich</a>.</p>
<p>Residing in Ipswich and, despite neither having been ordained as a <a>minister</a> or trained as a <a>physician</a>, Rogers practiced medicine and assisted in the ministry of his brother-in-law, local historian <a>William Hubbard</a>, whose service as Ipswich pastor ultimately extended for more than 50 years.  In 1682, Rogers was appointed <a>President of Harvard</a>, but having held the position for only two years, died suddenly at the age of 54.</p>
