<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Royal Academy (1842&#x2013;1864)</h3>
<p>[[File:Jan Adam Kruseman William II King of the Netherlands 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[King William II of the Netherlands]], founder of Royal Academy in Delft.]] Delft University of Technology was founded on January 8, 1842 by <a>King William II of the Netherlands</a> as <em>Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade</em> institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. On September 1, 1997 13 faculties of TU Delft were merged into 9, providing better efficiency in management of the increasing in size university. In the early 1990s, because of an overwhelming outnumbering of female students by men, an initiative to increase the number of women studying at the university resulted in founding a separate <a>emancipation</a> commission at TU Delft. As a result <em>Girls Study Technology</em> () days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.</p>
<p>[[File:Gebouw TU Delft.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The university's former main building has hosted the [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]] since 2008.]]</p>
<p>Since 2006 all buildings of the university are placed outside of the historical city center of Delft. Relatively new building of <a>Material Sciences</a> department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the <a>Haagse Hogeschool</a>. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many <a>institutes of applied sciences</a> from <a>the Hague</a> region as well as <a>Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk</a>, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between <a>Rotterdamseweg</a> street and <a>Leeghwaterstraat</a> street.</p>
<p>On May 23, 2008, a huge fire, presumably from the ruptured water pipe which short circuited a coffee machine in the building, completely destroyed the building of <a>Faculty of Architecture</a>. Luckily, architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well many architecture models, including chairs by  <a>Gerrit Rietveld</a> and <a>Le Corbusier</a>, was completely saved. Currently, Faculty of Architecture has moved to the old <a>Aula</a> of TU Delft.</p>
<p>2007 marks the moment when three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, <a>TU Eindhoven</a> and <a>University of Twente</a>, established a <a>federation</a>, called <a>3TU</a>.</p>
<h3>TU Delft logo</h3>
<p>Through the course of the years the <a>logo</a> of TU Delft changed, as its official name did. The current logo is based on three official university colors <a>cyan</a>, black and white, giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg street (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirect car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Mekelpark</h3>
<p>[[File:TU Delft Mekelpark.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Entrance to the [[Mekelpark]], with the statue of <a>Prometheus</a>, university's symbol.]] New university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating former TU Delft professor, working at the former mining department during the Second World War, <a>Jan Mekel</a>) was opened on July 5, 2009. <a>Mekelpark</a> replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and <a>gas station</a>, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total, Mineralogy-geology museum and <a>Beijerinck</a> en <a>Kluyver</a> archive.</p>
<p>Science Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center (), established in 1976 (became dysfunction in 1989) and later Delft Museum of Technology (), established in 1993 (became dysfunction in 2008). Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including <a>Israel</a> and <a>Czech Republic</a>. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of <a>geodesy</a>. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan street, in the buildings of the former department of <a>naval architecture</a> (), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into <a>lofts</a>), Science Center Delft hosts all collections of the former two technical museums. The current museum is a home to <a>film studio</a>, educational laboratories (like <a>Tesla Coil</a>). Among many exhibits, old models of previous and current TU Delft research projects are available, including <a>Eco Runner</a> and <a>Nuna</a>.</p>
<p><a>Beijerinck</a> en <a>Kluyver</a> archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.</p>
<p>Mineralogy-geology museum is a part of <a>Civil Engineering and Geosciences</a> and contains around 200,000 <a>geological</a>, <a>mineralogical</a> and <a>crystallographical</a> items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then <a>Delft Royal Academy</a>) was established.</p>
<h3>Botanical Garden</h3>
<p>TU Delft <a>botanical garden</a> dates back to 1917, where <em>Proof Garden for Technical Plantation</em> () was established by <a>Gerrit van Iterson Jr.</a>, TU Delft graduate and assistant to <a>Martinus Beijerinck</a>. <a>Iterson Jr.</a> was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of <a>tropical agriculture</a> in then Dutch colony of <a>Dutch East Indies</a>. These are (official Dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets): <a>Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering</a> (3mE) (), <a>Architecture</a> (A) (), <a>Civil Engineering and Geosciences</a> (CEG) (), <a>Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science</a> (EEMCS) (), <a>Industrial Design Engineering</a> (IDE) (), <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> (AE) (), <a>Technology, Policy and Management</a> (), and <a>Applied Sciences</a> (AS) ().</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Since 2004 TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: <a>bachelor</a>, <a>master</a> and <a>doctorate</a>. Academic year is divided into two semesters: first semester from September until January and second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through <a>OpenCourseWare</a>.</p>
<h2>Bachelor-level Studies</h2>
<p> As of 2010 TU Delft offers 14 <a>BSc</a> programmes. TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year long study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught only in Dutch, except for <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> programme, which is taught in both Dutch and English language.</p>
<h2>Master-level Studies</h2>
<p> As of 2010 TU Delft offers around 40 <a>MSc</a> programmes. The MSc studies take two years to complete. First year is devoted to theoretical studies, assignments and laboratory work. Second year is dedicated to research work, internships and thesis preparation.</p>
<p>TU Delft adopted <a>European Credit Transfer System</a>, where each year MSc student are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. Study progress of each TU Delft MSc student is monitored through faculty counsellor. An honors track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in <a>Dutch grading scale</a>) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside regular MSc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of <a>technology in society</a>. The honors track must be completed within the allowed time for MSc programme.</p>
<p>MSc programmes are also offered through <a>3TU</a> federation, <a>Erasmus Mundus</a> programmes, and through <a>IDEA League</a> joint MSc programmes.</p>
<h2>Doctoral-level Studies</h2>
<p>[[File:TU Delft PhD Defense committee.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Typical TU Delft's post-[[Doctoral studies|doctoral defense]] picture. <a>Promovendus</a> (middle) is accompanied by two <a>Paranymph</a>s. Madame <a>Bedel</a>, holds the <a>staff</a>, while all members of the defense committee wear <a>toga</a>s. Red tube held by the <a>doctoral</a> student covers the doctoral diploma. <a>Promovendus</a>, as well as Paranymphs must wear white ties.]] <a>Doctoral studies</a> at TU Delft are divided in two phases. First phase, one-year long, serves as a test during which doctoral candidate must prove that he is capable performing research on a doctoral level. If the candidate passed the evaluation performed by his/her <a>promotor</a>, then during the next three years candidate performs research which must be finalized by submitting a <a>doctoral dissertation</a>. Doctoral thesis is evaluated by doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and academics outside of the university (within and outside of the Netherlands). Once the thesis is revised and comments of the committee members are applied, the candidate can approach the formal doctoral defense. In contrast to USA doctoral-level studies, doctoral candidate does not follow any lectures nor pass additional exams, instead he/she focuses solely on research.</p>
<h3>Doctoral Defense</h3>
<p><a>Doctoral defense</a> is of ceremonial nature. It lasts exactly for an hour, during which doctoral candidate must answer all questions from every committee member. Sometimes doctoral candidate is accompanied by one or two Paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by <a>Bedel</a>, who enters a <a>senate</a> room, holding a university <a>staff</a> and says in Latin <em>It's time</em> (). After that committee moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant a doctorate or not. After that committee moves back to a room where a defense is held, introduced by a Bedel, and if the doctorate is granted <a>promotor</a> presents <a>laudation</a> praising a new <a>doctor</a>. All ceremony is chaired by a <a>rector</a> or its representative. Doctoral defense at TU Delft is public.</p>
<h2>Other degree programmes</h2>
<p>TU Delft also offers <a>Professional Doctorate in Engineering</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Research Institutes</h3>
<p>[[File:IRI Delft.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Building of [[Reactor Institute Delft]].]] TU Delft has three officially recognized <a>research institutes</a>: <a>Research Institute for Housing, Urban and Mobility Studies</a>, <a>International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar</a>, and <a>Reactor Institute Delft</a>. Apart of those three institutes TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including <a>Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology</a>, <a>Kavli Institute of Nanoscience</a>, <a>Netherlands Institute of Metals Research</a> (now part of <a>Materials innovation institute</a>), <a>Delft Centre for Aviation</a>, <a>Delft Centre for Engineering Design</a>, <a>Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems</a>, <a>Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute</a>, <a>International Research Institute for Simulation, Motion and Navigation Technologies</a>. Full list of research schools is available on TU Delft website, which aims at student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with last few pages published in English. <em>TU Delta</em> is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. Weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.</p>
<p>Also, approximately four times a year TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called <em><a>Delft Outlook</a></em>. <em>Delft Outlook</em> is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in <em><a>Delft Integraal</a></em> magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. <a>Columns</a> of some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p>TU Delft is governed by the <a>executive board</a> ().</p>
<p>Executive board is chaired academically by the <a>Rector Magnificus</a>. The currently appointed Rector Magnificus, Prof. Dr. Karel Ch.A.M. Luyben () and AAG (). AAG started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the earl 1970s as a counter-balance to AAG. Currently those two parties are competing each year for seats in TU Delft's Students Council (). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with <a>The Council of Student Societies Delft</a> VeRa () and <a>The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft</a> VSSD ().</p>
<p>Apart from <a>bachelor</a> and <a>master</a> student organizations, <a>PhD</a> students of TU Delft have their own organization called <a>Promood</a> (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) (), which represents TU Delft PhD students at then university. It is also a member of <a>Dutch PhD Students Network</a> ().</p>
<p> Each faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university, many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example <a>aerospace engineering</a> department hosts <a>Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management</a> (), while <a>civil engineering</a> department <a>Society for Practical Studies</a>. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including <a>European Association of Aerospace Students</a>.</p>
<p> Apart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a catholic <a>Wolbodo Student Society</a>, <a>Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft</a>, <a>Sint Jansbrug</a>, that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  Also organization that has its roots in <a>Rover Scout</a> movement <a>Delftsche Zwervers</a> (at the same time the oldest scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European <a>AEGEE</a>.</p>
<p> Student sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing club <a>Proteus-Eretes</a> (with many <a>Olympic medals</a> won by the members of the club) or <a>American football</a> club <a>Delft Dragons</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>[[File:Nuna 5.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Nuna 5]], from a series of <a>Nuna</a> <a>solar-powered</a> cars that won the <a>World Solar Challenge</a> four times, constructed by the students of TU Delft.]]</p>
<p>TU Delft researchers developed many new technologies used today, including <a>Glare</a>, a <a>Fibre Metal Laminate</a> used in <a>Airbus A380</a> <a>skin</a> and <a>Vision in Product Design</a> design method. <a>Cees Dekker</a>'s lab at TU Delft demonstrated in 1998 the first <a>transistor</a> made out of single <a>nanotube molecule</a>. <a>Delta Works</a> plan was, in part, a child of TU Delft graduates, including <a>Johan Ringers</a> and <a>Victor de Blocq van Kuffeler</a>. TU Delft was a precursor of <a>Open design</a> concept.</p>
<p>In architecture, TU Delft is famous for <a>Traditionalist School</a> in Dutch architecture. TU Delft was a home to many prominent <a>microbiologists</a> including <a>Martinus Beijerinck</a>, who in 1898 discovered viruses while working at TU Delft, and <a>Albert Jan Kluyver</a>, father of comparative microbiology, which resulted in the creation of so-called <a>Delft School of Microbiology</a>.</p>
<p>Some recent projects being developed at the university include <a>Flame</a>, first humanoid robot possessing the ability to walk as humans, <a>Superbus</a>, project aiming to design a high speed busses reaching the speeds of 250&nbsp;km/h, <a>Nuna</a>, <a>solar-powered</a> <a>race car</a> and four times winner of the <a>World Solar Challenge</a>, <a>Delfly</a>, <a>Micro air vehicle</a> and the smallest <a>ornithopter</a> so far fitted with a camera, <a>Fhybrid</a>, world's first <a>hydrogen</a>-powered <a>scooter</a>, <a>Tribler</a>, and <a>open source</a> <a>peer-to-peer</a> <a>client</a> with <a>online TV</a> functionalities, <a>Delfi-C3</a>, <a>CubeSat</a> <a>satellite</a> constructed by TU Delft students, <a>Greenchoice Forze</a>, <a>hydrogen fuel cell</a>-powered racing car, as well as <a>Eco-Runner</a> vehicle participating in <a>Eco-marathon</a>.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<h3>Students</h3>
<p>TU Delft is a male-dominated institution. In 2009 among all students of the university (<a>MSc</a> and <a>BSc</a> level) only 20% were women. The biggest imbalance between men and women is experienced by <a>Mechanical engineering</a> and <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> faculty, while the smallest is seen at <a>Industrial Design</a> and <a>Architecture</a> departments. Despite many efforts of the university to change that imbalance, the number of women studying at TU Delft stays relatively constant over the years. The same applies to the total student population (from approximately 13,250 in 2002 to almost 16,500 in 2009). Approximately half of the international students are European, among them the biggest group comes from (in decreasing order, number of students admitted in 2009): Belgium (approximately 340 students), Germany (approximately 100 students), Greece (approximately 100 students), and Italy (approximately 100 students). Among non-Europeans, the biggest nationality group comes from China (approximately 340 students; the number of Chinese and Belgian newly admitted students is relatively equal since 2003), then <a>Iran</a> (approximately 150 students), India (approximately 140 students), <a>Suriname</a> (approximately 100 students), <a>Indonesia</a> (approximately 80 students) and Turkey (approximately 80 students),, with many protests organized at TU Delft campus by Iranian TU Delft students during <a>2009 Iranian Election Protests</a>. The biggest number of international students studies at <a>Aerospace Engineering</a> and <a>Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science</a> departments.</p>
