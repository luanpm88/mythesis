<h2>History</h2>
<p>Green Mountain was founded in 1834 as Troy Conference Academy, a coeducational institution.  In 1863 the school&#x2019;s name changed to Ripley Female College; in 1874 back to Troy Conference Academy; in 1937 to Green Mountain Junior College.  Green Mountain became a two-year junior college for women in 1943. In 1974, the school changed its name to Green Mountain College and returned to coeducational status, offering four-year baccalaureate degrees. Beginning in the 1990s the college began to focus on environmental literacy and citizenship and has since received numerous environmental awards.</p>
<p>On April 22, 2010, GMC formally opened a new combined heat and power (CHP) biomass plant costing $5.8m. The school expects to reduce carbon emissions by more than 50% and reach carbon neutrality by 2011. The plant will burn about 4,000-5,000 tons of locally harvested woodchips each year as the primary fuel and it is expected to provide 85% of the school's heat and generate 20% of its electricity and is capable of generating 400,000 kWh of electricity.</p>

<h2>Green campus</h2>
<p>In 2007, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) awarded Green Mountain College the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award in the &quot;Under 1,000&quot; category. The award recognizes Green Mountain for commitment to environmental sustainability in its governance and administration, curriculum and research, operations, campus culture, and community outreach.</p>
<p>Green Mountain was named an EPA Energy Star Showcase Campus following campus-wide retrofitting of light fixtures.</p>
<p>Students have installed a wind turbine to power the campus green house and solar panel on the roof of the student center.</p>
<p>Through the Student Campus Greening Fund (SCGF) every GMC student contributes $30 from the college activities fee. Students design projects and submit proposals. Awards are based on a student vote. SCGF money has been used to install bike racks, purchase recycling bins, use bio-diesel in campus maintenance equipment, and upgrade the alternative energy systems that power the farm greenhouse.</p>
