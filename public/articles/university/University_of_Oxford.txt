<p>   The <strong>University of Oxford</strong> (informally <strong>Oxford University</strong>, or simply <strong>Oxford</strong>) is a <a>university</a> located in <a>Oxford</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a>. It is the second <a>oldest surviving university</a> in the world and the oldest university in the <a>English-speaking world</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxhist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sager, Peter (2005). Oxford and Cambridge: An Uncommon History. p36&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact date of foundation remains unclear, there is evidence of teaching there as far back as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first teacher known is Thibaud d'Etampes, not before 1116, for he was yet in France in 1114: Gineste, B., &quot;Thibaud d'&#x00c9;tampes&quot;, in <em>Cahiers d'&#x00c9;tampes-Histoire</em> 10 (2009), pp. 43-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The University grew rapidly from 1167 when <a>Henry II</a> banned English students from attending the <a>University of Paris</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxhist&quot;&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt; In <a>post-nominals</a> the University of Oxford was historically abbreviated as <strong>Oxon.</strong> (from the Latin <em>Oxoniensis</em>), although <strong>Oxf</strong> is nowadays used in official University publications.</p>
<p>After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to <a>Cambridge</a>, where they established what became the <a>University of Cambridge</a>. The two &quot;ancient universities&quot; have many common features and are often jointly referred to as <em><a>Oxbridge</a></em>. In addition to cultural and practical associations as a historic part of British society, the two universities have a long <a>history of rivalry</a> with each other.</p>
<p>Most undergraduate teaching at Oxford is organised around weekly essay-based <a>tutorial</a>s at self-governing colleges and halls, supported by lectures and laboratory classes organised by University faculties and departments. <a>League tables</a> consistently list Oxford as one of the UK's best universities,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times 2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Complete University Guide 2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxford consistently <a>ranks</a> in the world's top 10.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>For more than a century, it has served as the home of the <a>Rhodes Scholarship</a>, which brings students from a number of countries to study at Oxford as postgraduates or a second bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>The University is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of research-led <a>British universities</a>, the <a>Coimbra Group</a>, the <a>League of European Research Universities</a>, <a>International Alliance of Research Universities</a> and is also a core member of the <a>Europaeum</a>. It forms part of the <a>'Golden Triangle'</a> of British universities&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a constituent of the <a>'G5'</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:OUCOAcolourCopyrightKaihsuTai.png|thumb|left|The [[Arms of the University of Oxford|coat of arms]] of the University of Oxford.]]</p>
<p>The University of Oxford does not have a clear date of foundation. Teaching at Oxford existed in some form in 1096.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxhist&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The expulsion of foreigners from the <a>University of Paris</a> in 1167 caused many <a>English</a> scholars to return from <a>France</a> and settle in Oxford. The historian <a>Gerald of Wales</a> lectured to the scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, <a>Emo of Friesland</a>, arrived in 1190. The head of the University was named a <a>chancellor</a> from 1201, and the masters were recognised as a <em>universitas</em> or corporation in 1231. The students associated together, on the basis of geographical origins, into two &#x201c;<a>nations</a>&#x201d;, representing the North (including the <a>Scots</a>) and the South (including the <a>Irish</a> and the <a>Welsh</a>). In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a <a>college</a> or <a>hall</a> became customary in Oxford. Members of many <a>religious order</a>s, including <a>Dominicans</a>, <a>Franciscan</a>s, <a>Carmelites</a>, and <a>Augustinians</a>, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence, and maintained houses for students. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges to serve as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest were <a>William of Durham</a>, who in 1249 endowed <a>University College</a>, and <a>John I de Balliol</a>, father of the future <a>King of Scots</a>: <a>Balliol College</a> bears his name. Another founder, <a>Walter de Merton</a>, a <a>chancellor</a> of England and afterwards <a>Bishop of Rochester</a>, devised a series of regulations for college life; <a>Merton College</a> thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford as well as at the <a>University of Cambridge</a>. Thereafter, an increasing number of students forsook living in halls and religious houses in favour of living at colleges.</p>
<p>The new learning of the <a>Renaissance</a> greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onward. Among University scholars of the period were <a>William Grocyn</a>, who contributed to the revival of the <a>Greek language</a>, and <a>John Colet</a>, the noted <a>biblical scholar</a>. With the <a>Reformation</a> and the breaking of ties with the <a>Roman Catholic Church</a>, Catholic <a>Recusant</a> scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the <a>university of Douai</a>. The method of teaching at the university was transformed from the medieval <a>Scholastic method</a> to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered loss of land and revenues. In 1636, <a>Chancellor</a> <a>William Laud</a>, <a>archbishop of Canterbury</a>, codified the university statutes; these to a large extent remained the university's governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for <a>Oxford University Press</a>, and he made significant contributions to the <a>Bodleian Library</a>, the main library of the university. <a>thumb|In 1605 Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls. (North is at the bottom on this map.)</a> The university was a centre of the <a>Royalist</a> Party during the <a>English Civil War</a> (1642&#x2013;1649), while the town favoured the opposing <a>Parliamentarian</a> cause. From the mid-18th century onward, however, the University of Oxford took little part in political conflicts. <a>thumb|left|200px|An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742.</a></p>
<p>The mid nineteenth century saw the impact of the <a>Oxford Movement</a> (1833&#x2013;1845), led among others by the future <a>Cardinal Newman</a>. The influence of the reformed model of German university reached Oxford via key scholars such as <a>Benjamin Jowett</a> and <a>Max M&#x00fc;ller</a>.</p>
<p>Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for <a>religious dissent</a>, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Twentieth century Privy Council decisions (such as the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of theological bequests to colleges to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Although the University's emphasis traditionally had been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded in the course of the 19th century to encompass <a>scientific</a> and <a>medical</a> studies.</p>
<p>The mid twentieth century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by Nazism and Communism, relocating to Oxford.</p>
<p>The list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to <a>British politics</a>, the sciences, medicine, and literature. More than forty Nobel laureates and more than fifty <a>world leaders</a> have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Famous&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Women's education</h3>
<p>The University passed a Statute in 1875 allowing its delegates to create preliminary and final examinations at roughly undergraduate level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannon&quot;&gt;Frances Lannon <a>&quot;Her Oxford&quot;,</a> <em>Times Higher Education</em>, 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first four womens' colleges were established thanks to the activism of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (AEW). <a>Lady Margaret Hall</a> (1878&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;History&quot;,</a> Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;) was followed by <a>Somerville College</a> in 1879;&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;History&quot;,</a> Somerville College, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; the first 21 students from Somerville and LMH attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannon&quot;/&gt; The first two colleges for women were followed by <a>St Hugh's</a> (1886&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;History of the College&quot;,</a> St Hugh's College, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;), <a>St Hilda's</a> (1893&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Constitutional History&quot;,</a> St Hilda's College, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;) and <a>St Anne's College</a> (1952&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;St Anne's History&quot;,</a> St Anne's College, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;). Oxford though was long considered a bastion of male privilege,&lt;ref&gt;Joyce S. Pedersen <a>Book review,</a> H-Albion, May 1996, reprinted on H-Net Review website&lt;/ref&gt; and a quota of female students was instituted by the Universities dons in 1927 fixing the admission of women at about a quarter of the total, a ruling not abolished until 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannon&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Women have been eligible to be full members of the university and entitled to take degrees since 7 October 1920.&lt;ref&gt;1965. - <em>Handbook to the University of Oxford</em>. - University of Oxford. - p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's colleges were only given full collegiate status in 1959. Five previously all-male colleges became co-educational in 1974. Since 2008, when St Hilda's first admitted men, all Oxford colleges have been co-educational.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Women at Oxford&quot;,</a> University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;&lt;ref&gt;Jenifer Hart <a>&quot;Women at Oxford since the Advent of Mixed Colleges&quot;,</a> <em>Oxford Review of Education</em>, 15:3, 1989, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; the ratio is now about 48:52 in men's favour.</p>
<h2>Organisation== &lt;!-- &quot;s&quot; spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 --&gt;</h2>
<p>As a <a>collegiate university</a>, Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a <a>federation</a>: it comprises over forty self-governing <a>colleges</a> and <a>halls</a>, along with a central administration headed by the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>. The academic departments are located centrally within this structure; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabuses and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars. Colleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates. The members of an academic department are spread around many colleges; though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g. <a>Nuffield College</a> as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the <a>Bodleian</a>), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members). [[Image:Sheldonian Theatre Oxford.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Sheldonian Theatre]], built by <a>Sir Christopher Wren</a> between 1664 and 1668, hosts the University's <a>Congregation</a>, as well as concerts and degree ceremonies.]]</p>
<h3>Central governance</h3>
<p>The university's formal head is the <a>Chancellor</a> (currently <a>Lord Patten of Barnes</a>), though as with most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure, rather than someone involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of <a>Convocation</a>, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.</p>
<p>The <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>, currently <a>Andrew Hamilton</a>, is the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the University. Five Pro-Vice-Chancellors have specific responsibilities for Education; Research; Planning and Resources; Development and External Affairs; and Personnel and Equal Opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the Vice-Chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the <a>Student Union</a>. <a>Congregation</a>, the &quot;parliament of the dons&quot;, comprises over 3,700 members of the University&#x2019;s academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council. Oxford and Cambridge (which is similarly structured) are unique for this democratic form of governance.</p>
<p>Two university <a>proctors</a>, who are elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The collection of University Professors is called the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the graduate programmes within the University. Examples of Statutory Professors are the <a>Chichele Professorship</a>s and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with their own Head and elected board. They are the <a>Humanities Division</a>; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.</p>
<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p> [[File:Keble College Chapel - Oct 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Keble College]], one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford]] There are 38 <a>colleges of the University of Oxford</a> and 6 <a>Permanent Private Hall</a>s, each with its own internal structure and activities.&lt;ref name=CollegesandHalls&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; All resident students, and most academic staff, must be members both of a college or hall, and of the university. The heads of Oxford colleges are known by various titles, according to the college, including warden, provost, principal, president, rector, master or dean. The colleges join together as the Conference of Colleges to discuss policy and to deal with the central University administration. Teaching members of the colleges (fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons (though the term is rarely used by members of the university itself). In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments.</p>
<h3>Teaching and degrees</h3>
<p> Undergraduate teaching is centered on the tutorial, where 1&#x2013;4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week&#x2019;s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). Students usually have one or two tutorials a week, and can be taught by academics at any other college&#x2014;not just their own&#x2014;as expertise and personnel requires. These tutorials are complemented by lectures, classes and seminars, which are organised on a departmental basis. Graduate students undertaking taught degrees are usually instructed through classes and seminars, though there is more focus upon individual research.</p>
<p>The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a first degree. The first set of examinations, called either Honour Moderations (&quot;Mods&quot; and &quot;Honour Mods&quot;) or Preliminary Examinations (&quot;Prelims&quot;), are usually held at the end of the first year (after two terms for those studying Law, Theology, Philosophy and Theology, Experimental Psychology or Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology or after five terms in the case of Classics). The second set of examinations, the Final Honour School (&quot;Finals&quot;), is held at the end of the undergraduate course. Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours based on their performance in Finals. An upper second is the most usual result, and a first is generally prerequisite for graduate study. A &quot;double first&quot; reflects first class results in both Honour Mods. and Finals. Research degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after seven years from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a nominal fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to a &quot;MA&quot; or Master of Arts. All MAs were members of Convocation and until 1913 all resident members of <a>Convocation</a> were members of <a>Congregation</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; MAs, as members of Convocation, elected the <a>Chancellor</a> and <a>Professor of Poetry</a>, but recently Convocation has been widened to consist of all graduates.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>[[Image:Tom Quad, Christ Church 2004-01-21.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Quad]], <a>Christ Church</a> in the snow.]]</p>
<h3>Academic year</h3>
<p>The academic year is divided into three <a>terms</a>, determined by Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Michaelmas Term</a> lasts from October to December; <a>Hilary Term</a> from January to March; and <a>Trinity Term</a> from April to June.</p>
<p>Within these terms, Council determines for each year eight-week periods called <a>Full Term</a>s, during which undergraduate teaching takes place. These terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations).</p>
<p>Internally at least, the dates in the term are often referred to by a number in reference to the start of each full term, thus the first week of any full term is called &quot;1st week&quot; and the last is &quot;8th week&quot;. The numbering of the weeks continues up to the end of the term, and begins again with negative numbering from the beginning of the succeeding term, through &quot;minus first week&quot; and &quot;noughth week&quot;, which precedes &quot;1st week&quot;. Weeks begin on a Sunday. Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>Academic dress</a> is still commonly seen at Oxford; until the 1960s students wore it at all times (see <a>Academic dress of the University of Oxford</a>). Other traditions and customs vary by college.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>In 2005/06 the University had income of &#x00a3;608m, and the colleges &#x00a3;237m (of which &#x00a3;41m is a flow-through from the University). For the University, key sources were <a>HEFCE</a> (&#x00a3;166m) and research grants (&#x00a3;213m). For the colleges, the largest single source was endowments and interest (&#x00a3;82m) and residential charges (&#x00a3;47m). While the University has the larger operating budget, the colleges have a far larger aggregate endowment, at around &#x00a3;2.7bn compared to the University's &#x00a3;900m.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. The Central University's endowment, along with that of many of the colleges, is managed by the University's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.</p>
<p>The University also launched a fundraising campaign in May 2008, called <em>Oxford Thinking - The Campaign for the University of Oxford</em>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With a minimum goal of &#x00a3;1.25 billion, the Campaign is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>The admission process for undergraduates is undertaken by the individual colleges, working with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place at the University whichever college they choose.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Selection is based on achieved and predicted exam results; candidate-submitted written work; school references; interviews, which are held between applicants and college tutors; and, in some subjects, written admission tests prior to interview. Prospective students apply through the <a>UCAS</a> application system, in common with most British universities, but (along with applicants for <a>Cambridge</a>) must observe an earlier deadline.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high volume of applications and the direct involvement of the faculty in admissions, students are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year, with the exception of applicants for <a>Organ Scholarships</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The decentralised, college-based nature of the admissions procedure necessitates a number of mechanisms to ensure that the best students are offered admission to the University, regardless of whether the college they originally applied to can accommodate them. As such, colleges can 'pool' candidates to other colleges, whereby candidates can be interviewed at and/or offered admission to another college. Some courses may make &quot;open offers&quot; to some candidates, which do not carry an attachment to a particular college until <a>A Level</a> results day in August.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 the colleges, faculties and departments have published a &quot;common framework&quot; outlining the principles and procedures they observe.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate students may name preferred colleges in their applications. For undergraduate students, an increasing number of departments practice college reallocation to ensure that the ratio between potential students and subject places available at all colleges are as uniform as possible. Students who named colleges which are over-subscribed are reallocated to under-subscribed colleges for their subjects. Generally, students from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply as many factors besides academic performance are taken into account during the stringent admission procedure.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>For the Department of Physics, college reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn up and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.&lt;ref name=PhysicsFAQs&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the college eventually offering a candidate a place to read a subject may not be the one he/she originally applied to.</p>
<p>For graduate student admissions, many colleges express a preference for candidates who will be undertaking research in an area of interest of one of its fellows. <a>St Hugh's College</a>, for example, states that it accepts graduate students in most subjects, principally those in the fields of interest of the Fellows of the college.&lt;ref&gt;<a>St Hugh's College</a> - Subjects accepted&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps as a consequence of this, it is not uncommon for a graduate student to be a member of his/her supervisor's college, although this is not an official university requirement. For graduate students, admission is first handled by the relevant department, and then by a college.<a>thumb|Oxford University Museum of Natural History.</a></p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>Despite the University's claims that its admissions policies avoid bias against candidates of certain socioeconomic or educational backgrounds,&lt;ref name=&quot;Working with Schools and Colleges&quot;&gt;<a>Working with Schools and Colleges</a>, University of Oxford Gazette, 2006. Retrieved 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the fairness of Oxford admissions have continued to attract considerable public controversy through episodes such as the <a>Laura Spence Affair</a> in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Oxbridge entrance remains a central focus for many private and selective-state schools, and the lack of a more representative social mix at the university remains a point of national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Veiled accusations of racism, however, have been refuted by comparison of A-level results with successful applications.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the University refined its admissions procedure to take into account the academic performance of applicants' schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Students who apply from <a>state school</a>s and colleges have a comparable acceptance rate to those from <a>independent school</a>s (25% and 32% of applicants accepted respectively, 2006). However, most pupils who are accepted from state schools come from 'elite' grammar and selective schools, rather than <a>comprehensives</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Admissions Statistics 2006&quot;&gt;<a>Admissions Statistics 2006</a>, University of Oxford Gazette, 2007. Retrieved 11 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; About half of applications come from the state sector,&lt;ref name=&quot;Admissions Statistics 2006&quot;/&gt; and the University of Oxford funds many initiatives to attract applicants from this sector, including the new UNIQ Summer Schools, Oxford Young Ambassadors, Target Schools, and the FE Access Initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Working with Schools and Colleges&quot;/&gt; Most colleges also run their own access schemes and initiatives. [[Image:Ashmolean.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean]] is the oldest museum in <a>Britain</a>.]]</p>
<p>In 2002, the University of Oxford commissioned a research project&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of Professor Anthony Heath.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 2,000 applicants for admission participated in the project; about one third of them were admitted.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that, if anything, admissions tutors treat applicants from state schools more favourably than applicants from private schools with the same attainment.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The research also suggested that this discounting was justified as private school students need higher grades at entry to do as well as their state school educated peers in final university examinations.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the study found that applicants to arts subjects had an advantage in admission when they displayed high levels of <a>cultural capital</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Mature and part-time students are supported by the <a>Oxford University Department for Continuing Education</a>.</p>
<h3>Scholarships and financial support</h3>
<p>There are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate. With a total possible grant of &#x00a3;10,235 over a 3-year degree, it is the most generous <a>bursary</a> scheme offered by any British university.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the University, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from <a>Rhodes Scholarships</a> to the new Weidenfeld Scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Students successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with <a>scholarship</a>s and <a>exhibitions</a>, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although when tuition fees were first abolished, the amounts of money available became purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; &quot;commoners&quot; (originally those who had to pay for their &quot;commons&quot;, or food and lodging) being restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term &quot;scholar&quot; in relation to Oxbridge, therefore, had a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were &quot;noblemen commoners&quot; and &quot;gentlemen commoners&quot;, but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. &quot;Closed&quot; scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, exist now only in name.</p>
<p>From the inception of the <a>Church of England</a> until <a>1866</a> membership of the church was a requirement to receive the <a>BA degree</a> from Oxford, and &quot;dissenters&quot; were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871. Knowledge of <a>Ancient Greek</a> was required until 1920, and Latin until 1960. Women were admitted to degrees in 1920.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>[[Image:All Saints Church Oxford (1).jpg|left|thumb|All Saints Church, now [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College's]] library, on the <a>High Street</a>.]] Oxford has more then 100 libraries nearly 40 of which make up the Bodleian library system. Oxford's central research library is the <a>Bodleian</a>, founded by <a>Sir Thomas Bodley</a> in 1598 and opened in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With over 11 million volumes housed on  of shelving, it is the second-largest library in the UK, after the <a>British Library</a>. It is a <a>legal deposit</a> library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its main central site consists of the <a>Radcliffe Camera</a>, the Old Schools Quadrangle, the <a>Clarendon Building</a>, and the New Bodleian Building. A tunnel underneath <a>Broad Street</a> connects the buildings. There are plans to build a new book depository in Osney Mead,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and to remodel the New Bodleian building &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to better showcase the library&#x2019;s various treasures (which include a Shakespeare <a>First Folio</a> and a <a>Gutenberg Bible</a>) as well as temporary exhibitions. Several other libraries, such as the <a>Bodleian Law Library</a>, <a>Indian Institute Library</a>, <a>Radcliffe Science Library</a> and the <a>Oriental Institute Library</a>, also fall within the Bodleian&#x2019;s remit.</p>
<p>As well as the Bodleian, there are a number of other specialised libraries in Oxford, such as the <a>Sackler Library</a> which holds classical collections. In addition, most academic departments maintain their own library, as do all colleges. The University&#x2019;s entire collection is catalogued by the <a>Oxford Libraries Information System</a>, though with such a huge collection, this is an ongoing task.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Oxford University Library Services</a>, the head of which is Bodley&#x2019;s Librarian, is the governing administrative body responsible for libraries in Oxford. The Bodleian is currently engaged in a mass-digitisation project with <a>Google</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Pitt-rivers-m2.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]].]]</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>Oxford maintains a number of museums and galleries in addition to its libraries. The <a>Ashmolean Museum</a>, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by <a>Michelangelo</a>, <a>Leonardo da Vinci</a>, <a>Turner</a>, and <a>Picasso</a>, as well as treasures such as the <a>Scorpion Macehead</a>, the <a>Parian Marble</a> and the <a>Alfred Jewel</a>. It also contains &quot;<a>The Messiah</a>&quot;, a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence. The Ashmolean reopened in November 2009, after a &#x00a3;49m redevelopment,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; doubling the display space as well as providing new facilities.</p>
<p>The <a>Museum of Natural History</a> holds the University&#x2019;s anatomical and natural history specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on <a>Parks Road</a>, in the University&#x2019;s <a>Science Area</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among its collection are the skeletons of a <em><a>Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em> and <em><a>triceratops</a></em>, and the most complete remains of a <a>dodo</a> found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the <a>Simonyi</a> <a>Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science</a>, currently held by <a>Marcus du Sautoy</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Oxford Botanic Garden in Autumn 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Autumn in the Walled Garden of the [[Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]].]]Adjoining the Museum of Natural History is the <a>Pitt Rivers Museum</a>, founded in 1884, which displays the University&#x2019;s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General <a>Augustus Pitt Rivers</a> stipulated that the University establish a lectureship in anthropology.</p>
<p>The <a>Museum of the History of Science</a> is housed on Broad St in the world&#x2019;s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 15,000 artifacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the <a>history of science</a>. In the Faculty of Music on <a>St Aldate's</a> is the <a>Bate Collection</a> of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly comprising of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. The <a>Botanic Garden</a> is the oldest botanic garden in the UK, and the third-oldest scientific garden in the world. It contains representatives from over 90% of the world&#x2019;s higher plant families. <a>Christ Church Picture Gallery</a> holds a collection of over 200 <a>old master</a> paintings. </p>

<h2>Oxford in literature and other media==&lt;!-- This section is linked from <a>Oxford</a> --&gt;</h2>
<p> Oxford University is the setting for numerous works of fiction. Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when <a>Chaucer</a> in his <em><a>Canterbury Tales</a></em> referred to a &quot;Clerk [student] of Oxenford&quot;: &quot;For him was levere have at his beddes heed/ Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,/ of Aristotle and his philosophie/ Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrie&quot;. As of 1989, 533 Oxford-based novels had been identified, and the number continues to rise.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford in Fiction: an annotated bibliography, Judy G. Batson&lt;/ref&gt; Famous literary works range from <em><a>Brideshead Revisited</a></em>, by <a>Evelyn Waugh</a>, to the trilogy <em><a>His Dark Materials</a></em> by <a>Philip Pullman</a>, which features an alternate-reality version of the University. Sir Humphrey Appleby, GCB, KBE, MVO, MA (Oxon) attended the fictional Baillie College in <em><a>Yes Minister</a></em>, and <em>The Complete Yes Minister</em> book's introduction, dated September 1919, was written from the equally fictitious Hacker College, presumably named for Sir James (or Lady) Hacker, Minister for Administrative Affairs in <em>Yes Minister</em> and Prime Minister in <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, MP for Birmingham South-East.</p>
