<p><strong>Westminster Theological Seminary</strong> is a <a>Presbyterian</a> and <a>Reformed</a> <a>Christian</a> graduate educational institution located in <a>Glenside, Pennsylvania</a>, with a satellite location in <a>London</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The <a>Seminary</a> was formed in 1929, largely under the leadership and funding of <a>J. Gresham Machen</a>. Though independent, it has long had a close relationship with the <a>Orthodox Presbyterian Church</a>, which Machen helped found in 1936.  The first president of the Seminary was <a>Edmund Clowney</a>, who served from 1966 until 1984.  He was followed by George Fuller and Samuel T. Logan.  The current president is Peter Lillback, who also serves as a professor of Historical Theology.</p>
<p>Westminster was <a>accredited</a> in 1986 by the <a>Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada</a> and received accreditation in 1954 by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<p>Two former branch campuses of the Seminary are now independent theological institutions. In 1982, the <a>California</a> branch of Westminster became an independent institution, <a>Westminster Seminary California</a>, and in 2009 the <a>Dallas, Texas</a> branch was established as <a>Redeemer Theological Seminary</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>All trustees and faculty members are required to affirm their agreement with the theological perspective presented in the <a>Westminster Confession of Faith</a> and the <a>Larger</a> and <a>Shorter Catechism</a>s, the core doctrinal statements of many <a>Presbyterian</a> denominations.</p>
<p>The Seminary currently offers the following degrees: <a>Master of Divinity</a>, several <a>Master of Arts</a> variants, <a>Master of Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a>, and <a>Doctor of Ministry</a>.</p>
<p>Westminster publishes the semi-annual <em><a>Westminster Theological Journal</a></em>.</p>
