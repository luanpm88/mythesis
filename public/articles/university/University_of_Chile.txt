<p>The <strong>University of Chile</strong> () is the largest and oldest institution of higher education in <a>Chile</a> and one of the oldest in the Americas. Founded in 1842 as the replacement and continuation of the former colonial Royal University of San Felipe (1738)<em> (Spanish: Real Universidad de San Felipe)</em>, the university is often called <em>Casa de Bello</em> (House of Bello) in honor of its first president, <a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a>. Notable alumni include two Nobel laureates (<a>Pablo Neruda</a> and <a>Gabriela Mistral</a>) and twenty heads of state among many others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Higher education in Chile in colonial times dates to 19 August 1622, when the first university in Chile, <em>Santo <a>Tom&#x00e1;s de Aquino</a></em>, was founded. On 28 July 1738, its name changed to <em>Real Universidad de San Felipe</em>, in honor of King <a>Philip V of Spain</a>. </p>
<h3>Universidad de Chile</h3>
<p>In 1841 the minister of public education, <a>Manuel Montt</a>, conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the &quot;advancement and development of sciences and humanities&quot;. <a>Andr&#x00e9;s Bello</a> formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on 19 November 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.</p>
<p>The Universidad de Chile was formally opened on 17 September 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five <a>faculties</a> (<em>facultades</em>): <a>Humanities</a> &amp; <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Mathematical</a> <a>Science</a>s &amp; <a>Physics</a>, <a>Law</a> &amp; <a>Political Science</a>s, <a>Medicine</a>, and <a>Theology</a>. By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; <a>Education</a> Sciences, <a>Legal</a> &amp; <a>Social Sciences</a>, <a>Biology</a> &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, <a>Agronomy</a> &amp; <a>Veterinary</a>, and <a>Fine Art</a>s.</p>
<p>Almost all of Chile's presidents graduated from the University of Chile, including all of those in the 20th century with the exception of <a>Eduardo Frei Montalva</a> (<a>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a>), General <a>Carlos Ib&#x00e1;&#x00f1;ez del Campo</a> and former military dictator General <a>Augusto Pinochet Ugarte</a>.</p>
<h3>Major Reforms during Military Regime of 1973-1989</h3>
<p>During <a>Augusto Pinochet</a>'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University suffered many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 stated that the University's Presidents would be designated by the Military Regime.</p>
<p>The second major blow to the University's integrity came on 3 January 1981, when another Decree completely restructured the University. All of its provincial campuses were separated, cojoined with provincial campuses of the Universidad T&#x00e9;cnica del Estado (now <a>Universidad de Santiago de Chile</a> and <a>Universidad de Atacama</a>) and designated as separate universities, such as the <a>Universidad de Talca</a>, <a>Universidad de Valparaiso</a>, the Instituto Pedag&#x00f3;gico (Pedagogical Institute, now the <a>Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educaci&#x00f3;n</a>), the <a>Universidad de Antofagasta</a>, the <a>Universidad de Tarapac&#x00e1;</a>, Instituto Professional de Osorno (now <a>Universidad de los Lagos</a>), Instituto Professional de Chill&#x00e1;n (now <a>Universidad del B&#x00ed;o-B&#x00ed;o</a>), <a>Universidad de la Frontera</a>, and <a>Universidad de la Serena</a>.</p>
<p>These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the military government as a way to severely diminish the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements. Simultaneous to this process, the <a>Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x00f3;lica de Chile</a> was heavily supported so that it would grow to a size comparable to the University of Chile. In concrete terms, in 1973 the University of Chile had a record number of students enrolled: over 65,000 students. Today it has only 26,000 students. In contrast, the Catholic University of Chile has grown from approximately 15,000 students in 1973 to over 21,650. Several private universities were created towards the end of the military regime, and some of these institutions have shown tendencies towards neoliberal economics. In this way the &quot;<a>Chicago Boys</a>&quot; have been able to perpetuate their influences on Chilean economics and public policies through higher education.</p>
<p>In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains as one of Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.</p>
