<p> <img> The <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</strong> (Hindi:&#x092d;&#x093e;&#x0930;&#x0924;&#x0940;&#x092f; &#x092a;&#x094d;&#x0930;&#x094c;&#x0926;&#x094d;&#x092f;&#x094b;&#x0917;&#x093f;&#x0915;&#x0940; &#x0938;&#x0902;&#x0938;&#x094d;&#x0925;&#x093e;&#x0928;,&#x0916;&#x0921;&#x093c;&#x0917;&#x092a;&#x0941;&#x0930;)(commonly known as <strong>IIT Kharagpur</strong> or <strong>IIT KGP</strong>) is an autonomous <a>engineering</a>, <a>technology</a> and <a>management</a> oriented institute of <a>higher education</a> established by the <a>Government of India</a> in 1951. The first of the original five <a>IITs</a> to be established, it is officially recognised as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India and is regarded as one of the best engineering institutions in India. IIT Kharagpur has been ranked the best Engineering college by Outlook  magazine for consecutive years in 2009 and 2010.IIT Kharagpur has been ranked amongst the top engineering colleges in India by various education surveys such as <em>India Today</em> &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; &quot;OutLook&quot; &quot;DataQuest&quot;.</pre>
<p>IIT Kharagpur was established to train scientists and engineers after India <a>attained independence</a> in 1947. It shares its organisational structure and <a>undergraduate admission process</a> with sister IITs. The students and alumni of IIT Kharagpur are informally referred to as KGPians. Among all IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the largest campus (2,100&nbsp;<a>acre</a>s), the most departments, and the highest student enrolment. IIT Kharagpur is particularly famous for its festivals: <a>Spring Fest</a> (Social and Cultural Festival), <a>Kshitij</a> (Techno-Management Festival)and Shaurya  (sports festival).</p>
<p>Vinod Gupta School Of Management was founded in 1993 when IIT Kharagpur realized the need for IITs to produce managers who could lead organizations in a dynamic technological environment where change is a way of life. Founded with a generous contribution of Mr Vinod Gupta, founder Infocom, USA along with an equally generous support from Government of India,VGSOM started functioning with a batch size of 30 students. Over the years VGSOM has grown heaps and bounds and now attracts the best management talent in the country.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:IIT Kharagpur Old Building 1951.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Hijli Detention Camp]] (photographed in September 1951) served as IIT Kharagpur's first academic building.]]</p>
<p>With the help of <a>B. C. Roy</a> (then <a>Chief Minister of West Bengal</a>), Indian educationalists <a>Humayun Kabir</a> and <a>Jogendra Singh</a> formed a committee in 1946 to consider the creation of <em>Higher Technical Institutions</em> for <a>post-war</a> industrial development of India. This was followed by the creation of a 22-member committee headed by <a>Nalini Ranjan Sarkar</a>. In its interim report, the Sarkar Committee recommended the establishment of <em>Higher Technical Institutions</em> in various parts of the country along the lines of the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, with affiliated secondary institutions. The report urged that work should start with the speedy establishment of major institutions in the four quarters of the country with the ones in the East and the West to be set up immediately.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The main building of the institute during construction (January 1955)</a></p>
<p>On the grounds that <a>West Bengal</a> had the highest concentration of industries at the time, B. C. Roy persuaded <a>Jawaharlal Nehru</a> (<a>India's first Prime Minister</a>) to establish the first institute in West Bengal. The first Indian Institute of Technology was thus established in May 1950 as the &quot;Eastern Higher Technical Institute&quot;. The institute was initially located in [[Esplanade, Calcutta|Esplanade East]], [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], and in September 1950 shifted to its permanent campus at [[Hijli]], [[Kharagpur]] located 120&nbsp;kilometres southwest of Kolkata. When the first session started in August 1951, there were 224 students and 42 teachers in 10 departments of the institute. The class rooms, laboratories and the administrative office were housed in the historic building of the [[Hijli Detention Camp]] (now known as ''Shaheed Bhawan''), where [[Freedom fighters of India|political revolutionaries]] were imprisoned and executed during the [[British Raj|British rule]]. The office building had served as the headquarters of the Bomber Command of the [[Twentieth Air Force|U.S. 20th Air Force]] during World War II. To honour B.C.Roy (Bidhan Chandra Roy), the area in front of the main building is named Bidhan Chowk.</pre>
<p>The name &quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; was adopted before the formal inauguration of the institute on 18 August 1951 by <a>Maulana Abul Kalam Azad</a>. On 15 September 1956, the <a>Parliament of India</a> passed the <em>Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act</em> declaring it an <em>Institute of National Importance</em>. Prime Minister Nehru, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur in 1956, said: </p>
<p>The Shaheed Bhawan was converted to a museum in 1990. The Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex was incorporated as another academic complex of the institute with <a>Takshashila</a> starting operation in 2002 and Vikramshila in 2003.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Organisational structure of the IITs</a></p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur shares a common <em>Visitor</em> (a position held by the <a>President of India</a>) and the <a>IIT Council</a> with other IITs. The rest of IIT Kharagpur's organisational structure is distinct from that of the other IITs. The Board of Governors of IIT Kharagpur is under the IIT Council, and has 13 members that include representatives of the states of <a>West Bengal</a>, <a>Bihar</a>, <a>Jharkhand</a> and <a>Orissa</a>, in addition to other members appointed by the IIT Council and the institute's <a>senate</a>. Under the Board of Governors is the institute's director, who serves as the chief academic and executive officer of the IIT. He is extensively aided by the deputy director. Under the director and the deputy director are the <a>deans</a>, heads of departments, registrar, president of the students' council, and chairman of the hall management committee. The registrar is the chief administrative officer and oversees day-to-day operations. He is the custodian of records, funds, and other properties of the institute.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur receives disproportionately more funding than other engineering colleges in India. While the total government funding to most other engineering colleges is around <a>Rs.</a>&nbsp;100&#x2013;200&nbsp;million (US$&nbsp;2&#x2013;4.5&nbsp;million) per year, IIT Kharagpur gets nearly Rs.&nbsp;1,300&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;30&nbsp;million) per year. Other sources of funds include student fees and research funding by industry-sponsored projects. IIT Kharagpur subsidises undergraduate student fees by approximately 80% and provide scholarships to all <a>M.Tech.</a> students and research scholars to encourage them to pursue higher studies. The cost borne by undergraduate students, including boarding and mess expenses, is around Rs.&nbsp;90,000 ($&nbsp;2,000) per annum. 35% of undergraduate students are given additional financial support based on personal need and economic background, with their annual expenses being nearly Rs.&nbsp;45,000 ($&nbsp;1000).</pre>
<p>The academic policies of IIT Kharagpur are decided by its senate. It consists of all professors of the institute, and administrative and student representatives. The senate controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards. The director of IIT Kharagpur is the <em>ex officio</em> chairman of the senate.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur follows the <a>credit</a>-based system of performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of [[Grade (education)#India|grades]], with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. For each semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average from all the courses with their respective credit points. Each semester's evaluation is done independently with a cumulative [[grade (education)|grade point average]] (CGPA) reflecting the average performance across semesters. The medium of instruction is English.</pre>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Institute Main Building, IIT Kharagpur</a> IIT Kharagpur is located  west of <a>Kolkata</a>. The campus is located five kilometres away from Kharagpur's railway station. The layout of the present campus and the design of the buildings were carried out by a group of engineers and architects under the guidance of <a>Werner M. Moser</a>, a Swiss architect. The  campus is residence to about 20,000 inhabitants. The campus has a total of 55&nbsp; kilometres (34&nbsp;miles) of roadways.</pre>
<p>The 20 student <a>hostels</a> are located on either side of Scholars Avenue, which extends from the institute gate to the B. C. Roy Technology Hospital. The three earliest halls&#x2014;Patel, Azad, and Nehru&#x2014;together constitute the PAN loop or Old Campus, which is located just next to Scholar's Avenue. There are eight hostels for undergraduate male students (MMM, RP, RK, MS, LLR, HJB, Patel, Azad and Nehru) and one for undergraduate female students (SN). Another hostel for women has quite recently been constructed. In addition, there are a few post-graduate students' hostels including two for women and two hostels for research scholars (BCR and JCB) and a separate hostel for scholars from the armed forces.</pre>
<p>In addition to the main campus at Kharagpur, the institute has an extension centre at Kolkata to provide venues for continuing education programmes, distance learning courses, and guesthouse accommodation. The institute plans to expand the Kolkata extension centre at <a>Rajarhat</a>, and use it to offer full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses from the 2008 session onwards. The  Rajarhat campus will house 2,500 students, and will eventually expand to . The institute's plan for a similar branch campus of  in <a>Bhubaneswar</a> was scrapped following rejection by the Union Human Resource and Development ministry.</p>
<h3>Academic buildings</h3>
<p>[[Image:Takshashila 1.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Takshashila]] complex]] <a>right|200px|thumb|Vikramshila complex in IIT Kharagpur.</a> IIT Kharagpur has 19 academic departments, 8 multi-disciplinary centres/schools, and 13 schools of excellence in addition to laboratories and central research facilities. Apart from the main building in the central academic complex, the <em>Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex</em> also has common academic facilities. In the S. R. Complex, the Takshashila building houses the G. S. Sanyal School of Telecommunication, the School of Information Technology and the Computer and Informatics Centre; and has facilities for conducting lecture classes as well. Vikramshila is another academic building in the S. R. Complex, having four lecture halls, several seminar rooms, and Kalidas Auditorium, which has a seating capacity of 850. The School of Medical Science and Technology is housed in the basement of the Vikramshila building.</p>
<p>The main building houses most of the administrative offices of the institute. It has numerous lecture halls, and two big auditoriums on either side. The tower of the main building has a steel tank with 10,000 imperial gallons of water capacity for emergency supply needs. The Netaji Auditorium in the main building is used for official functions and events, and doubles as a cinema theatre on weekend nights, showing movies to the IIT community at subsidised rates.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur's first library was located in a small room of the institute's Old Building (<em>Shaheed Bhawan</em>). At the time of its opening in 1951, the library had a collection of 2,500 books. Now located in the main building of the institute, the Central Library is one of the largest of its type. Its collection includes over 350,000 books and documents, and it subscribes to more than 1,600 printed and online journals and conference proceedings. The library has six halls and a section exclusively for <a>SC</a> and <a>ST</a> students. The library's collection consists of books, reports, conference proceedings, back volumes of periodicals, standards, theses, micro-forms, CD-ROMs, floppies, and audio-visual material. The library's transaction service is automated and online searches are possible through an <a>Online Public Access Catalog</a> (OPAC). The Electronic Library section has a collection of databases, video lectures and miscellaneous other resources.</p>
<p>The <a>Nehru Museum of Science and Technology</a> has over a hundred indoor exhibits that include technical models collected from various institutions across India. The park outside the museum contains 14 open-air demonstrations and outdoor exhibits, including a hunter plane and a steam engine. The museum also has an archive room, showcasing documents relating to the history of the institute and <a>West Midnapore district</a>. The Rural Museum, located in the Rural Development Centre of the institute, has a collection of exhibits in local culture.</pre>
<h3>Civic amenities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|250px|The B.C. Roy Technology Hospital is a civic hospital inside the IIT's campus.</a></p>
<p>The institute campus has six guest houses, a civic hospital, four nationalised banks, four schools, a railway reservation counter and a police station within its limits. The campus has its own water pumping station, electrical sub-station, telephone exchange, a market, six restaurants, and a garbage disposal section for the daily needs of the residents.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur is located just outside the town of Kharagpur, in the Hijli village. The civic amenities provided to the campus of IIT Kharagpur make it nearly self-sufficient with regards to the basic needs of the residents. As Kharagpur is a small town, there is limited direct interaction between the campus community and the town. There is also little opportunity for the employment of family members of the faculty. Unlike some other IITs (such as <a>IIT Bombay</a>), IIT Kharagpur does not restrict outsiders' entry into the campus. IIT Kharagpur provides much of its benefits to the local community through the Rural Development Centre (RDC) located in the campus. Established in 1975, the RDC helps the local community by developing customised technologies. The RDC also co-ordinates the <a>National Service Scheme</a> (NSS) programs in IIT Kharagpur, with the members of NSS taking part in weekly community service activities such as sanitation, road construction, teaching and building educational models.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2005, IIT Kharagpur started construction of a boundary wall for the security of the campus, which is now complete. Mild restrictions apply to entry of outside vehicles. The boundary wall was opposed by the local community as it would hinder their access to amenities provided by the institute. Campus residents have also been denied direct access to the adjoining Hijli railway station as a result of this wall. The local community also opposes the construction of a <a>flyover</a> from the railway station to the campus, as it would lead to substantial losses of opportunity for the shops along the roads. The construction of the 1052.69&nbsp;m long flyover has been approved by the <a>Indian Railways</a> and <a>West Bengal state government</a>. It will be formally called Hijli Road overbridge, and will be constructed for estimated cost of Rs.&nbsp;237&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;5.3&nbsp;million).</p>
<h2>Admissions and academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Entrance gate of IIT Kharagpur</a></p>
<p>Admission to most undergraduate and postgraduate courses in IIT Kharagpur is granted through written entrance examinations. Admission to M.S. and Ph.D. programmes is based primarily on a personal interview, though candidates have to take written tests as well.</p>
<p>Admission to undergraduate programmes in all IITs is tied to the <a>Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination</a>, popularly known as IIT-JEE. Candidates who qualify for admission through IIT-JEE can apply for admission in 4 year <a>B.Tech.</a> (<em>Bachelor of Technology</em>), 5 year Dual Degree (Integrated <a><em>Bachelor of Technology</em></a> and <em>Master of Technology</em>) and 5 year integrated M.Sc. (<a><em>Master of Sciences</em></a>) courses at IIT Kharagpur. The admissions to postgraduate programmes (M.Tech.) are made primarily through the <a>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</a> (GATE). Other prominent postgraduate entrance exams include Joint Admission to M.Sc. (JAM) for M.Sc., and Joint Management Entrance Test (JMET) for management studies.</p>
<p>As per the rules of admission to IIT Kharagpur, 15% of the seats are reserved for students belonging to <a>Scheduled Castes</a> (SC) and 7.5% for <a>Scheduled Tribes</a> (ST). As of 2008, 27% separate reservation exists for the <em><a>Other Backward Class</a>es</em>.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur is a member of <a>LAOTSE</a>, an international network of universities in Europe and Asia exchanging students and senior scholars. The institute has been ranked as India's best engineering institute by <em><a>India Today</a></em> in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2007. In the <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>'s <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> (2006), IIT Kharagpur was the only engineering school from India listed among the top 500 universities worldwide.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate education</h3>
<p><a>thumb|250px|A lecture auditorium in IIT Kharagpur in the relatively new Vikramshila complex</a></p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur offers a number of degrees as part of its undergraduate programmes. They include <a>Bachelor of Technology</a> (B.Tech.), <a>Bachelor of Architecture</a> (B.Arch.) and the <a>5 year integrated Master of Science</a>. The B.Tech. degree is the most common undergraduate degree in IIT Kharagpur in terms of student enrolment. It is based on a four-year programme with eight semesters. The first year of the B.Tech. curriculum has common courses from various departments. At the end of the first year, an option to change departments is given to meritorious students on the basis of their performance in the first two semesters. In the final year of their studies, most of the students are offered jobs in industries and other organisations through the Training and Placement (T&amp;P) section of the institute. Some students opt out of this facility in favour of higher studies or by applying to recruiting organisations directly. In addition to the [[academic major|major degree]] as part of the undergraduate education, students can take courses from other departments, and by demonstrating knowledge of a discipline based on performance parameters and course objectives set by the department, earn a minor in that department.</pre>
<h3>Postgraduate and doctoral education</h3>
<p>IIT Kharagpur offers a number of postgraduate programmes including Master of Technology (M.Tech.), <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA), and Master of Sciences (M.Sc.). Some specialised graduate programmes offered by IIT Kharagpur include Postgraduate Diploma in <a>Information Technology</a> (PGDIT), Master in Medical Science and Technology (<a>MMST</a>), Master of <a>City Planning</a> (MCP), Postgraduate Diploma in <a>Intellectual Property Law</a> (PGDIPL), and Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Operation &amp; Management (PGDMOM). IIT Kharagpur offers the Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.) as part of its <a>doctoral education programme</a>. The doctoral scholars are given a topic of academic interest by the professor, or sometimes work on the consultancy projects sponsored by various industries. The duration of the programme is usually unspecified and depends on the specific discipline. Ph.D. scholars have to submit a <a>dissertation</a> as well as conduct an oral defence of their <a>thesis</a>. <a>Teaching assistant</a>ships (TA) and <a>research assistant</a>ships (RA) are provided based on the scholar's academic profile. IIT Kharagpur offers an M.S. (by research) programme; the M.Tech. and M.S. being similar to the US universities' non-thesis (course-based) and thesis (research-based) master programmes respectively.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur (along with other IITs) offers Dual Degree programs that integrate undergraduate and postgraduate studies in selected pairs of branches and specialisations. Most of the Dual Degree programs involve specialisation in the major field of education of the student. But for a dual degree involving an MBA from <a>Vinod Gupta School of Management</a>, the selection is made on the basis of an aptitude test of students across all engineering streams. The Dual Degree program spans a period of five years as against six years in conventional B.Tech. (four years) followed by an M.Tech. or MBA (two years). IIT Kharagpur has a management school (<a>Vinod Gupta School of Management</a>) and a law school (<a>Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law</a>) on its premises. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law has been opened in collaboration with <a>George Washington University</a>.</p>
<h3>Continuing education</h3>
<p>IIT Kharagpur offers the Continuing Education Programme (CEP) for qualified engineers and scientists to learn new technologies and developments in their academic disciplines. As part of CEP, the institute offers formal degree programmes (M.Tech. and Ph.D.) and an Early Faculty Induction Programme (EFIP) under the Quality Improvement Programme (QIP), short-term courses supported by the <a>All India Council for Technical Education</a>, self-financed short-term courses supported by course fees, and certificate courses conducted as distance education. In addition to conducting educational courses, the CEP develops model curricula for engineering education. As of 2006, the CEP has facilitated publication of 103 course curriculum books. The CEP administers SIMAP (Small Industries Management Assistant Programme) and STUP (Skill-cum-Technology Upgradation Programme) on behalf of IIT Kharagpur; the institute being a corpus institute of <a>SIDBI</a> (Small Industries Development Bank of India).</pre>
<h3>Sponsored research</h3>
<p>[[File:Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell, IIT Kharagpur.jpg|right|140px||thumb|[[Kalpana Chawla]] Space Technology Cell, IIT Kharagpur.]] The institute received 171 research revenue worth <a>Rs.</a>&nbsp;417&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;9.25&nbsp;million)&#x2014;and 130 consultancy projects in the 2005&#x2013;06 session. The institute transferred 15 technologies to industry during the same session. The institute has filed 125 patents so far and 25 of them have been granted. This does not include patents obtained by individual professors or students. During the same session, the value of the international projects was Rs.&nbsp;9.9&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;220,000), and the revenue from transferred technologies was about Rs.&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;55,000). The institute earned Rs.&nbsp;520&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;11.5&nbsp;million) from research projects in the 2005&#x2013;06 session. IIT Kharagpur has had a separate cell known as the SRIC (Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy) cell since 1982. It handles sponsored research projects and industrial consultancy assignments, and has the infrastructure to simultaneously administer 600 [[research and development|R&amp;D]] projects.</pre>
<h3>Institutes and departments</h3>
<p>One recently established department is the Centre for Ocean, River, Atmosphere and Land Science (CORALs). It is an academic and research department in earth sciences.</p>
<h2>Student life and culture</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|300px|Madan Mohan Malviya Hall: One of the 18 student halls in IIT Kharagpur</a> IIT Kharagpur provides on-campus residential facilities to its students, research scholars, faculty members and many of its staff. The students live in hostels (referred to as <em>halls</em>) throughout their stay in the IIT.</pre>
<p>Hostel rooms are wired for Internet connectivity, for which students have to pay a compulsory charge. Most of the rooms in the halls of residences are designed to accommodate one student per room. Now (2005&#x2013;2009), due to scarcity of sufficient student accommodation, two students are required to share a single seater room for the first two years.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students must choose between <a>National Cadet Corps</a> (NCC), <a>National Service Scheme</a> (NSS) and <a>National Sports Organisation</a> (NSO) for their first two years of study. IIT Kharagpur has common sports grounds for cricket, football, hockey, volleyball, lawn tennis, badminton, and athletics; and swimming pools for aquatic events. Most of the hostels have their own sports grounds.IIT Kharagpur also organises its annual inter-collegiate sports and games meet in the month of october</pre>
<p>The students of IIT Kharagpur compete among themselves in various events held under the purview of open-IIT and inter-hall events, and the results of the latter contribute to the overall tally of points that determine the winner of <em><a>General Championship</a></em>. The four broad categories in which General Championships are decided are Sports, Social &amp; cultural activities, Technology, and Hall affairs. The women's hostel together participate as a single team in all events with the exception of sports, where women's team do not participate at inter-hall level. IIT Kharagpur participates in the <a>Inter-IIT Sports Meet</a>, held annually in one of the IITs by policy of rotation.</pre>
<p>[[Image:RP Hall Common Room.JPG|thumb|left|A common room in a hostel during a [[cricket]] match telecast]] The students of IIT Kharagpur choose their representatives by elections held under the purview of the <a>Technology Students' Gymkhana</a>. The highest-ranking student representative chosen by the elections is the Vice-President of the Gymkhana, and represents the students in the senate. All halls nominate two representatives for the senate. The Gymkhana publishes an annual magazine called <em>Alankar</em>. A fortnightly newsletter called <a>The Scholar's Avenue</a>, named after the avenue common to the student halls, is also published by an independent student body. Individual halls organise &quot;Hall day&quot; &#x2014; an annual event that involves lighting and decoration of the organising hall, with a social gathering of students from all halls&#x2014;during the month of March. The event is also used by the halls to popularise their candidates for student body elections.</pre>
<p>Students who violate the code of conduct of the institute have to defend themselves in front of the Hall Disciplinary Committee (HDC), which investigates the case and prescribes punishment if necessary. Students may appeal against the punishment to the <a>Appellate</a>-cum-<a>Liaison</a> Committee known as Inter Hall Disciplinary Committee (IHDC). The IHDC submits its recommendations to the Senate, which finalises the punishment. Extreme cases of indiscipline are referred directly to the IHDC. The IHDC is empowered to give punishments to students for acts of indiscretion committed anywhere in India. IIT Kharagpur has strict provisions dealing with physical and mental harassment of junior students ([[ragging]]). Students found harassing their juniors are suspended from the institute, without going through the Disciplinary Committee.</pre>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>IIT Kharagpur has vibrant student life in the form of many Festivals like <a>Spring Fest</a>, Kshitij which act as great platform for participants from all over the world. Spring Fest, the annual social and cultural festival, is held in the month of January acting as a excellent stage to hone talent, to enjoy and at the same time send out a strong social message as the youth of the nation. Having a history of 51 years, Spring Fest includes numerous cultural competitions in addition to stage shows (known as <em>Star-nights</em>) by noted singers and performers of likes of <a>K.K.</a>, <a>Pritam</a>, <a>Kailash Kher</a>, <a>Shaan</a>, <a>Breathe</a>, <a>Led Zepplica</a>, <a>Parikrama</a> etc. The event attracts participation from colleges across India.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell) is a student's organisation, functioning under STEP (Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park), from within the Institute, with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship among students throughout India. It provides mentorship and support to startup companies and helps them with financing, through Venture Capitalists and incubation,through STEP and SRIC, IIT Kharagpur.</p>
<p>E-Cell is ranked first among all the student-level entrepreneurship bodies in India in terms of its activity and influence on students.</p>
<p>It conducts two major events, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit(GES), which is a three-day event, held in the month of January at IIT Kharagpur and Entrepreneurship Awareness Drive(EAD), a 10-day event, consisting of Guest Lectures in 10 cities spread across India. The Knowledge Camp is also conducted annually for the benefit of students within IIT-Kgp, while the Innovation Platform and Fund-aKGPian programs continue throughout the year, to recognise and support innovative ideas among students of IIT-Kgp, besides numerous Workshops and Guest Lectures throughout the year.</p>
<p>Prof. Sunil Handa, <a>Padma Shri</a> Prof. Anil K. Gupta, <a>Sanjeev Bhikchandani</a>, <a>Vinod Dham</a>, <a>Arjun Malhotra</a> are some of the speakers, who have delivered lectures within and outside IIT -Kgp, due to the efforts of E-Cell.</p>
<p>E-Cell has been instrumental in the establishment of School of Engineering Entrepreneurship (SoEE), the first of its kind in India. Besides E-Cell has played a key role in the Deferred Placement Programme (DPP), whereby, a student can opt for placement a year after the completion of his/her course, in case they are involved in a startup company. This is the first time such a programme is being offered at the Undergraduate level in India.</p>
<h2>Placements at IIT Kharagpur</h2>
<p>The international placements began in the year 2006. Two foreign companies, oil giants <a>Schlumberger</a> and <a>Royal Dutch Shell</a>, have visited the campus this time and have offered annual salaries to the tune of $80,000. The reason was that earlier the IIT was fully dedicated to the service of the nation but after the fee hike, it had to abandon its policy. IIT Kharagpur&#x2019;s Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSOM) had wrapped up Vantage 2008, its annual recruitment programme, on a high note with a 30% inc.rease in the average compensation levels offered to the 121-strong batch, reports Sreeradha D Basu in Kolkata. The highest international compensation of $80,000 (Rs 32 lakh approximately) this time around beats last year&#x2019;s Rs 13 lakh, with an increase of over 146%.According to IT magazine Dataquest&#x2019;s annual survey,IIT Kharagpur is second best technology college in terms of placement in India.</p>
<p>This huge jump can be attributed to the fact that it is the first time in IIT Kharagpur&#x2019;s history that students have been allowed to take up foreign placements by companies. &#x201c;We, in fact, had a documented policy of not allowing foreign placements. This was overturned last year,&#x201d; GS Sinha, former IIT Kgp&#x2019;s placement in-charge, said. &#x201c;Since all the other IITs were already allowing this, we wanted it to happen at IIT-Kharagpur as well,&#x201d; he added.</p>
<p>&#x201c;Since we got the permission a bit late last year, the kind of active marketing that was required did not happen. This year, we plan to plug into our alumni network and scale up the process in a much bigger way,&#x201d; said Prof Sinha. In 2011 batch,<a>Goldman Sachs</a> recruited 10 students on a package of Rs. 26 lakhs per annum.</p>
<p><a>Barclays Capital</a> recruited 11 students with a package of US $55,000(Rs.22 lacs./annum) in December 2009. The highest salary offered till now is Rs 1.7 crore by <a>social networking site</a> <a>Facebook</a> in an off-shore recruitment (of which ESOPs were offered valued at 1 crore). The 2010 batch of B.Tech students saw 94% placements while the remaining preferred IIMs or entrepreneurship.<a>Deutsche Bank</a> recruited 9 students on a package of Rs. 15 lakhs per annum.</p>
