<p><strong>Ferris State University</strong> (<strong>FSU</strong>, <strong>Ferris</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> with its main campus in <a>Big Rapids</a>, <a>Michigan</a>, <a>USA</a>. Founded in 1884 as the Big Rapids Industrial School by <a>Woodbridge Nathan Ferris</a>, an educator from <a>New England</a> who later served as governor of the <a>State of Michigan</a> and finally in the <a>US Senate</a> where he remained until his death in 1928. The school was noteworthy at its time for accepting female students beginning with its first graduating class. It is also the only public university in Michigan to be founded by an individual.</p>
<p>Today Ferris is the ninth largest university in the state with 14,381 students Two- and four-year degrees are offered through ten academic colleges and graduate degrees from six. Ferris grants professional <a>doctorate</a> degrees via its optometry and pharmacy colleges and a doctorate of education in community college leadership through the College of Professional and Technological Studies.</p>
<p>The school is known for its high rate of employment amongst graduates,</p>
<p>As a child, Woodbridge attended a rural public school, which he claimed, was the horror of his life. He did learn to read fairly well there, however, and by the age of 10 was reading the <a>Civil War</a> news to his father. His father was slightly deaf, and Ferris had to learn to speak clearly in order for his father to hear, because his father objected to the practice of merely reading loudly. The practice of clear enunciation, learned at an early age, was a great help to Ferris in his later life as a speechmaker.</p>
<p>When he was 14&nbsp;years old, Ferris entered the academy at Spencer, NY, where he spent nine months. At the age of 16, Ferris attended his first teaching institute at Waverly, NY, and shortly afterwards began his first teaching job. Later, in early spring of 1871, Ferris entered the Oswego Normal and Training School at Oswego, NY. At Oswego (now the <a>State University of New York at Oswego</a>) Ferris came under the tutelage of Hermann Krusi, instructor of drawing and geometry. Krusi was the son of the chief assistant to <a>Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> at Pestalozzi's school in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Oswego Normal during its formative years was pushing the Pestalozzian theory of learning by doing rather than through theory, and Ferris was considerably influenced by it. At Oswego, Ferris met Helen Gillespie, who later became his wife.</p>
<p>In early 1874, Ferris became the principal of Spencer Free Academy. He married Helen Gillespie who also served as a teacher at Spencer. At the end of the second year at Spencer, the Ferrises decided not to continue in public school work but rather to follow his dream of founding a private school. That dream led Mr. Ferris through several ventures involving private education. In 1879, Ferris once again entered public education as superintendent of schools in Pittsfield, IL. He held this position for five years, leaving it vowing never again to be involved in public education. In May 1884, he moved his family to Big Rapids, MI with the intention of opening a private school. The Big Rapids Industrial School, forerunner of Ferris State University, opened on September 1, 1884.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as an educator, Ferris ran for and was elected to the office of Governor of the State of Michigan in 1912. His overwhelming popularity also got him elected to the office of US Senator in 1922.&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  <a>thumb|right| Ferris Mausoleum in Highland View Cemetery</a> --&gt;Woodbridge Ferris died on March 23, 1928, eleven years to the day of Helen Ferris' death. A thousand Ferris students and townspeople gathered at the train station standing in the drizzling rain in silent tribute as the funeral train pulled in. All businesses and schools, including the Institute, were closed the day of the funeral. Many state elected officials attended the funeral, including Governor <a>Fred W. Green</a>. Six military companies and the 126th infantry band marched in the funeral cortege to Highland View Cemetery in Big Rapids, where Mr. and Mrs. Ferris are both interred.</p>
<h3>The school</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Ferris State University seal, prominently displaying the school's year of foundation, 1884</a> Big Rapids Industrial School, as it was originally named, opened on September 1, 1884 in temporary quarters in the Vandersluis Block (present location of J.C. Penney Co.) in Big Rapids. The goal of the school was to provide students with marketable skills for a changing society. By the beginning of the next semester in January 1885 the school changed its name to Ferris Industrial School. In January 1894, the School moved into and dedicated its new building, Old Main, on the corner of Oak and Ives Streets. At this same time, the school was incorporated with capital stock of $50,000.</p>
<pre> </pre>
<p>In 1898 the institution was again renamed to Ferris Institute. In 1900, W. N. Ferris sold capital stock in Ferris Institute to the public, keeping a controlling interest in his own hands. It remained privately owned until August 25, 1931 when the Board of Incorporators, a group of 39 businessmen, purchased Ferris Institute from the old stockholders and selected a board of trustees from their number to govern the school.</p>
<p>The campus is within easy walking distance of downtown Big Rapids with its restaurants, shops, movie theater, art gallery and municipal park. Bicyclists, hikers and in-line skaters have easy access to the <a>White Pine Trail</a>, Michigan's longest &quot;rails to trails&quot; project.</p>
<p>The campus has undergone major changes over the last nine years. Several new and renovated buildings, reworked roads and parking areas, pedestrian walkways, and greenspace areas have contributed to the changes on campus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The FLITE building (FSU Library for Information, Technology and Education), located at the termination of Perry Street, reintroduced the historic front entrance to the university, and defined the adjacent quad at the campus epicenter.</li>
  <li>The renovation of the Timme Library to the Timme Center for Student Services consolidated previously scattered student services in one location.</li>
  <li>The Granger Center for Construction and HVACR, stimulated redevelopment of the northern part of campus. The building was designed with an open layout that left most of the mechanical components open for viewing by the students as a working lab.</li>
  <li>The IRC Connector between the Business School and the Instructional Resource Center (IRC) created a collaborative meeting and lounge space which is heavily used by students at all hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>The University has  of building space on the Big Rapids campus, with  in academic use.</p>
<h3>Satellite locations</h3>
<p>In addition to the main campus, Ferris State University has programs offered at 18 off-campus locations including <a>Dowagiac</a>, <a>Grand Rapids</a>, <a>Flint</a>, <a>Lansing</a>, <a>Traverse City</a>, and <a>University Center</a>. These locations are managed by the College of Professional and Technological Studies.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Administrative structure</h3>
<p>Ferris State University is governed by a Board of Trustees which has general supervision of the institution and controls and directs institutional expenditures. Members of the Board serve eight-year, staggered terms as appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the <a>State Senate</a>.</p>
<p>The President of the University is appointed by the Board of Trustees as its principal executive officer and serves at its pleasure. The President is an <a>ex-officio</a> member of the Board without the right to vote.</p>
<h3>Current leadership</h3>
<p>At present, the University is led by its 18th president, Dr. David L. Eisler, who was in inaugurated on October 2, 2003.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>&quot;The mission of the Student Government of Ferris State University is to represent student interests in all aspects of campus life as well as maintain open channels of communication between students, faculty, administration, and the Big Rapids community.&quot; The leadership of the group consists of an Executive Board (president, executive vice-president, vice-presidents of finance, internal assessment, technology and campus affairs along with treasurer and parliamentarian), Senate (representing the various colleges) and a House of Representatives (registered student organizations).</p>
<p>The Finance Division is actually separate from the student government itself, but works together as allocating student funds require the approving votes from the Senate and House. The Finance Division is run by the vice-president of finance, along with a committee of members. The Finance Division seeks to distribute student funds to a variety of student organizations around campus on request, as any campus organization may apply for money. Distribution of all student funds, including major events such as homecoming and Ferris Fest, are directed through the Finance Division.</p>
<p>The Division of Internal Assessment (IA) is a committee within the student government that seeks to provide accountability for all members and assessment of progress for the organization. IA is run by the vice-president of Internal Assessment, along with a committee of members in a similar fashion to that of the Finance Division. The Vice-President of Internal Assessment is in charge of running the committee, approving new members before bringing them to a vote before the Senate and House and initiating expulsion procedures along with organizing all aspects of the elections.</p>
<p>At the start of each semester new ad-hoc committees are created and chairpersons are appointed to chair each committee. Many times a committee may reach for an achievable goal and dissolve upon completion. However, most committees are oriented around goals that may be broad and continuous, such as member recruitment and putting on special events, and thus may need to be re-initiated at the start of every semester.</p>
<p>SGFSU is notable for creating Textbookunion.com, a cost saving initiative for textbook prices that has gained recognition across student bodies around the <a>United States</a>. Created in 2006 by the Textbook Committee, textbookunion.com has been presented at state and national student government conferences such as <a>Association of Michigan Universities</a> and <a>COSGA</a>, respectively. Although it currently only feeds textbook information from specific <a>Michigan</a> universities, textbookunion.com is in the process of bringing it to the national level. Any student may still use its sophisticated search engine to find the lowest price on the internet for a specific textbook.</p>
