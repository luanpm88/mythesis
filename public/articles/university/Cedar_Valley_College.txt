<p><strong>Cedar Valley College</strong> is a <a>community college</a> of the <a>Dallas County Community College District</a> (DCCCD), located in <a>Lancaster</a>, <a>Texas</a> (<a>USA</a>) in southern <a>Dallas County</a>.  Cedar Valley first opened its doors in 1977 and has an enrollment of more than 7,000 students.</p>
<p>Beginning in Spring of 2004, Cedar Valley College began operating the Cedar Valley College Center at Cedar Hill.  The extension center, located in <a>Cedar Hill, Texas</a>, will assist the district's continuing education program featuring classes on computer software, dance, English as a second language, health and wellness, writing r&#x00e9;sum&#x00e9;s and <a>CPA</a> accreditation.</p>
<p>For the 2008-09 school year, Cedar Valley began a joint <a>dual credit enrollment</a> project with the <a>Dallas Independent School District</a> and the <a>Cedar Hill Independent School District</a> . The new Dallas school established for the project is named Early College High School and provides the opportunity for its graduates to accomplish a high-school diploma and 60 hours of college credit concurrently. Like most <a>early college high school</a> programs, the school was designed to attract students who do not typically enroll in traditional dual-credit programs, such students whose parents did not attend college and those that might feel a college education is not financially possible.  The new Cedar Hill school is named <a>Cedar Hill Collegiate High School</a>, and attracts students who are seeking 60 college credit hours upon graduating High School. The school's staff worked particularly hard to recruit black and Latino males; groups among the least likely to earn college degrees, but is open to students of all backgrounds</p>
