<p> </p>
<p><strong>Washington State University</strong> (<strong>WSU</strong>, commonly pronounced <strong>Wazzu</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research university based in <a>Pullman</a>, <a>Washington</a>, in the <a>Palouse</a> region of the <a>Pacific Northwest</a>.  Founded in 1890, WSU is the state's original and largest <a>land-grant</a> university and confers bachelor's, master's, professional and doctoral degrees, and offers more than 200 fields of study. The university is well known for its programs in veterinary medicine, agriculture, animal science, food science, plant science, architecture, neuroscience, criminal justice and communications, as well as its atmospheric, biological chemistry, shock physics, sleep and wood materials research laboratories. It is one of 96 public and private universities in America with &quot;very high research activity,&quot; as determined by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>. WSU is ranked among the top half of national universities at 106th according to <em>U.S. News</em>.</p>
<p>The university also operates branch campuses across Washington known as <a>WSU Spokane</a>, <a>WSU Tri-Cities</a>, and <a>WSU Vancouver</a>, all founded in 1989. These campuses award primarily bachelor's and master's degrees. Freshmen and sophomores were first admitted to the Vancouver campus in 2006 and to the Tri-Cities campus in 2007. The university also offers eight undergraduate degrees, a professional science masters and an online <a>MBA</a> to students around the world through WSU Online, formerly known as Distance Degree Programs. Total enrollment for the four campuses and WSU Online exceeds 25,900 students. This includes a record 1,447 international students, the highest since 1994 when there were 1,442.</p>
<p>WSU's <a>Division I</a> athletic teams are called the <a>Cougars</a>. The six men's and nine women's varsity teams compete in the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Washington State University was established by the <a>Washington</a> Legislature on March 28, 1890, less than five months after statehood was declared on November 11, 1889. The institution was one of the land-grant colleges created under the 1862 federal <a>Morrill Act</a> signed into law by President <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>. The federal land grants for the new institution included  of federal land for an agricultural college and  for a school of science.</p>
<p>After an extended search for a location, the state's new land-grant college opened in Pullman on January 13, 1892. The year 1897 saw the first graduating class of seven men and women. The school changed names from <strong>Washington Agricultural College and School of Science</strong> to <strong>State College of Washington</strong> in 1905, and then to Washington State University in 1959.</p>
<p>Enoch A. Bryan, appointed July 22, 1893, was the first influential president of WSU. Bryan held graduate degrees from <a>Harvard</a> and <a>Columbia</a> and previously served as the president of <a>Vincennes University</a> in Indiana. Prior to Bryan's arrival the fledgling university suffered through significant organizational instability. Bryan guided WSU toward respectability and is arguably the most influential figure in the history of WSU. The landmark clock tower in the center of campus is his namesake.</p>
<p>WSU's role as a statewide institution became clear in 1894 with the launch of its first Agricultural Experiment Station west of the <a>Cascade Mountains</a> near <a>Puyallup</a>. WSU has subsequently established extension offices and research centers in all regions of the state, with major research facilities in <a>Prosser</a>, <a>Mount Vernon</a>, and <a>Wenatchee</a>. In 1989, WSU officially gained branch campuses in <a>Spokane</a>, the <a>Tri-Cities</a>, and <a>Vancouver</a>. Overall, the Federal Government and the State of Washington have entrusted 190,000 acres (769&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land to WSU for <a>agricultural</a> and <a>scientific</a> research throughout the <a>Pacific Northwest</a>.</p>
<p>Professional education began with establishment of the School of Veterinary Science in 1899; in 1902 the first two veterinary science students graduated and in 1909 the first Doctor of Veterinary Science degrees were awarded. The veterinary school was elevated to college status in 1916, becoming the College of <a>Veterinary Medicine</a> in 1925.</p>
<p><a>Graduate education</a> began in the early years and, in 1902, the first master's degree was conferred, an M.S. in <a>Botany</a>. In 1917, the institution was organized into five colleges and four schools, with deans as administrative heads, and in 1922 a <a>Graduate School</a> created.  In 1929, the first Ph.D. degree conferred, one in <a>Bacteriology</a>.</p>
<p>In September 2009, the university made national headlines when it was determined that there were over 2,500 possible cases of the H1N1 swine influenza cases among the university's on-campus students. While many colleges and universities either have been, are, or will be the site of large numbers of both H1N1 and seasonal flu cases in the fall and winter of 2009 during the pandemic, this high of a number of suspected cases- even if not all are confirmed as being the H1N1 strain- is unusual.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Regents</h3>
<p>Washington State University is chartered by the State of Washington. A Board of Regents governs the university and provides direction to the President. There are ten regents appointed by the governor, nine of whom serve six-year terms. The tenth is a student regent appointed on an annual basis. As of March 2009 a proposal under consideration by the state legislature would add an eleventh to the board, appointed from the faculty for a three-year term, whose role would be limited to issues not dealing with faculty. Currently the regents are Theodor P. Baseler, Scott E. Carson, Harold A. Cochran, Elizabeth A. Cowles,  Francois X. Forgette, Laura M. Jennings, Connie M. Niva, V. Rafael Stone, Ericka Christensen (student), and Michael Worthy.</p>
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>The President, currently <a>Elson S. Floyd</a>, serves as the chief executive officer. The Provost and Executive Vice President, currently <a>Warwick M. Bayly</a>, handles academics, research and faculty matters for WSU statewide. Floyd, former president of <a>University of Missouri System</a>, succeeded <a>V. Lane Rawlins</a> on May 21, 2007. Bayly was formerly Dean of the WSU College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<h3>WSU Foundation</h3>
<p>The WSU Foundation is an independent, private corporation with its own Board of Governors and Chief Executive Officer that serves as a fundraising organization for the university. The CEO currently is Brenda Wilson-Hale; the Board Chair is Larry A. Culver.</p>
<h3>Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The WSU Alumni Association is also an independent body with a Board of Directors and President. The WSUAA is organized into 34 regional alumni groups called chapters. The Association's mission is &quot;Encouraging excellence to enhance the quality and global recognition of WSU, Supporting Scholarships to help students attain a WSU education, and Making Connections to connect back to WSU through services and programs for alumni and friends.&quot; The Association hosts numerous socials and networking events for alumni in addition to sponsoring many on-campus activities. WSU University Relations also provides support for the Association through the Office of Alumni Relations. The current Executive Director of Alumni Relations is Tim Pavish '80, and the Board President is Rob Ellsworth, '97. The most famous WSU alumnus is <a>Edward R. Murrow</a>, the influential broadcaster for whom the WSU communication college is named.</p>
<h3>Faculty</h3>
<p>The Faculty Senate serves as the sounding board for the more than 2,200 faculty members. All major academic decisions must be approved by the Senate. The Senate is composed of representatives from each academic college and department, and from all four WSU campuses.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a WSU presidential committee analyzing possibilities of creating new synergies through a re-alignment by moving departments and creating new schools.</p>
<h3>Students</h3>
<p>WSU has two representative <a>student body</a> organizations: the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU) founded in 1915 and the Graduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA) founded about 1970. ASWSU's organizational framework is similar to that of most American governments complete with an appointed and confirmed judiciary, elected representatives (from districts) to a senate, and an annually elected president and vice-president team. The president also has a paid staff led by the Chief of Staff ranging in size from 6-12 members, depending on the year. GPSA is similar, but differs in that it lacks a judiciary or a paid staff. The GPSA is centered on the senate which is composed of a large number of senators that represent different graduate and professional programs. The GPSA also has an executive Council that consists of the GPSA President, Vice-Presidents, and nine District Representatives that are elected from the nine colleges of WSU.</p>
<p>In recent years, the student body completed several major projects on campus. In addition to passing a $15 transportation fee to increase Pullman Transit's service, the student body also voted to remodel the Compton Union Building. The building closed in May 2006 and re-opened in August 2008. In March 2006, ASWSU voted to support the renovation of <a>Martin Stadium</a>, adding $25 per semester to undergraduate student fees.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>[[File:CougQ400.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Horizon Air [[Q400]] in unique WSU livery]]</p>
<p>Three primary periodicals serve the university community. They are Washington State Magazine, for alumni, friends, faculty and staff; WSU Today daily e-newsletter and Web site for faculty, staff and graduate students; and <a>The Daily Evergreen</a>, the student newspaper. The first issue of the Evergreen was published in 1895, while the magazine's roots trace to the WSU alumni periodical PowWow, first published in 1910.</p>
<p>WSU broadcast media include <a>Northwest Public Radio</a> and Television, the network of public radio and television stations in the Northwest owned and operated by Washington State University. Today's network of AM and FM radio stations evolved from the university's original station that went on the air December 10, 1922, making it one of the earliest in the country. Its call letters changed over time from KFAE to KWSC to KWSU. <a>Edward R. Murrow</a> got his start in radio at KWSC.</p>
<p><a>Cable 8 Productions</a> is a local student-operated cable TV channel serving WSU and the Pullman-Moscow area. KZUU 90.7 FM, a non-commercial college radio station, is a service of ASWSU. It gained FCC approval in 1979. KUGR Sports Rock is a student-operated, online radio station. Among the students who operate these media are broadcasting students in WSU's <a>Edward R. Murrow College of Communication</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> The university offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in 200 fields of study through 65 departments, schools and programs.</p>
<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p>These departments, schools and programs are organized into 10 academic colleges as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>College of Agricultural, Human and Natural Resource Sciences</li>
  <li>College of <a>Business</a></li>
  <li><a>Edward R. Murrow College of Communication</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Education</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Engineering</a> and <a>Architecture</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Liberal Arts</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Pharmacy</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Nursing</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Sciences</a></li>
  <li>College of <a>Veterinary Medicine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, WSU has a University College for students who have not declared majors, an all-university Honors College, a Graduate School, and an accredited intensive English program for non-native speakers (the <a>Intensive American Language Center</a>).</p>
<h3>WSU Libraries</h3>
<p>WSU Libraries coordinates the administration of the six major libraries on WSU's Pullman campus (Architecture, Brain Education, Fischer Agricultural Sciences, Animal Health, Holland/Terrell, and Owen Science &amp; Engineering libraries) and five libraries off the Pullman campus (Betty M. Anderson, WSU Energy Program, WSU Spokane, WSU Tri-Cities, WSU Vancouver libraries). Five minor libraries on the Pullman campus (GLBA, Heritage House, Human Relations &amp; Diversity, Music, and Women's Resource Center collections) are outside the WSU Libraries. WSU Libraries also participate in the Orbis Cascade Alliance, a consortium of 36 university and college libraries in Washington and Oregon offering the Summit catalog and an inter-library loan system. WSU Libraries utilize ILLiad, ArticleReach, RAPID, and DOCLINE for document delivery.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>WSU spent $283.1 million on research in the 2008 fiscal year. In 2007 National Science Foundation rankings of research and development expenditures, WSU ranked 22nd among public research universities without a medical school, 57th among all public research institutions, and 82nd among all research institutions, public and private.</p>
<p>Research and scholarship at WSU is rooted in agriculture, natural for a land-grant university. The institution's first leader, <a>George W. Lilley</a> (1891&#x2013;1892), was both president of the then named Washington Agricultural College and School of Science and director of the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station. Subjects taught by the first five faculty members included agriculture, botany, horticulture, forestry, and veterinary science.</p>
<p>In 1894, the sixth faculty member, <a>William Jasper Spillman</a>, arrived to teach plant science and mathematics and serve as the first <a>wheat</a> <a>breeder</a>. The WSU wheat research and breeding program continues to serve the Washington wheat industry, the sixth largest in the nation in 2008-2009. The state's wheat growers work closely with WSU researchers on development of new wheat varieties that meet their needs.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s food and agriculture research helps sustain the state&#x2019;s annual $29 billion food industry. Faculty partnered with agriculture interests to create today's $3 billion a year <a>wine grape</a> business  while the Apple Genome Project draws collaboration from scientists worldwide to map the <a>apple</a> genome, research aimed at supporting the apple industry.</p>
<p>Food science is another long-time research field at WSU. Work in the 1940s on types of <a>cheese</a> suitable for storing in cans or tins led to creation of now award-winning <a>Cougar Gold cheese</a>, a white <a>cheddar</a> produced at the WSU Creamery with milk from the university's dairy herd. In 2009, the <a>Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) approved the use of microwave energy for producing pre-packaged, low-acid foods, and WSU professor Juming Tang led development of the technology by university, industry and U.S. military scientists.</p>
<p>In terms of productivity, WSU plant sciences faculty rank No. 2 in the nation, animal sciences faculty rank fourth, and food science faculty rank sixth according to Academic Analytics&#x2019; 2007 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index. In addition, WSU agricultural studies have helped shape U.S. public policy by showing how <a>sustainable farming</a> practices sidestep the environmental hazards of conventional agriculture. The Climate Friendly Farming project helps farmers adopt methods that mitigate global climate change.</p>
<p>Veterinary medicine and animal health are also important research areas at WSU. In 2008, a $25 million grant from the <a>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> funded a large share of the cost for a research facility for a new WSU School for Global Animal Health. Its scientists address global infectious disease challenges by detecting diseases within animal populations and controlling their transmission. The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory located at WSU works closely with the <a>U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> and the <a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to develop and deploy diagnostic tests for livestock diseases.</p>
<p>In the area of <a>clean technologies</a>, university researchers work to raise the efficiency and reliability of the nation&#x2019;s <a>electrical power grid</a>, improve air quality forecasting in the Northwest, and conduct cooperative research projects under the <a>Department of Energy</a> Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI). Scholars are developing an algae-based <a>biofuel</a> that consumes <a>greenhouse gas</a>es in its production and are working to patent nanospring technology that would fit into an ordinary gas tank, solving the problem of <a>hydrogen storage</a>. In 2001, WSU professor M. Grant Norton and <a>University of Idaho</a> physics professor David McIlroy were the first scientists to create nanosprings. Recent <a>positron</a> research discoveries could yield the first practical method for containing and transporting an <a>antimatter</a> fuel.</p>
<p>WSU is also home to one of the few remaining Nuclear Research Reactors in the country. The Nuclear Radiation Center is a 1MW TRIGA Conversion reactor built in 1961 during <a>President Eisenhower's</a> <a>Atoms for Peace</a> initiative. It is a very potent research tool utilized by WSU's <a>radiochemistry</a> graduate program, as well as providing education on the nuclear industry to the public through talks and facility tours.</p>
<p>Other recent research highlights include studies of the effects of <a>sleep</a> and sleep loss on human cognitive functioning, work to advance shock compression science with contracts awarded to the WSU Institute for Shock Physics by the <a>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA) and the Department of Energy, and a program funded by the <a>National Science Foundation</a> that trains doctoral students to analyze evolutionary processes. Reproductive biologist Patricia A. Hunt was named one of the top 50 researchers of 2007 by <a>Scientific American</a> for her work showing a potential threat to human health posed by <a>bisphenol A</a> (BPA), a component of the polycarbonate plastics used to make food and beverage containers.</p>
<p>Over the years, WSU research and scholarship included the 1968 discovery of the <a>Marmes Man</a> at the Marmes Rockshelter in southeastern Washington, the nation's oldest human remains at that time; the development of <a>high-yielding dwarf wheat</a>; discovery of insect resistance to pesticides; and creation of a method to store cheese in tins, which led to the university's well known and still produced <a>Cougar Gold Cheese</a>. WSU fruit breeders have developed many varieties for the state including, in 1952, the sweet, yellow <a>Rainier cherry</a>, and in 2010 an <a>apple</a> specifically for Washington, code name WA 2.</p>
<h3>Outreach and Public Service</h3>
<p>WSU <a>Extension</a> has offices in each of Washington's 39 counties, providing training and assistance in agricultural practices, natural resource management, human and life skills, diversity understanding and outreach, the state <a>4-H</a> program, and many other programs. In 1973 in Seattle, WSU Extension founded the now national <a>Master Gardener Programs</a> of trained volunteers. WSU Extension faculty and staff have also provided assistance for programs in under-developed and developing countries. Many faculty members have appointments to do research, teach, and provide extension services.</p>
<p>The State of Washington's network of Small Business Development Centers is a cooperative effort of Washington State University, other public educational institutions, economic development organizations and the <a>US Small Business Administration</a>. A source of counsel on starting and growing small firms, the centers are found in 17 locations in Western Washington and seven location in Eastern and Central Washington.</p>
<p>The WSU Creamery, an outreach and teaching program, has garnered a reputation for fine dairy products, most notably the <a>Cougar Gold cheese</a> sold at the creamery store, Ferdinand's, as well as online and at some local Pullman stores. The cheese is regionally famous and fetches the price of $18&#x2013;$24 for a 30 oz can. Cougar Gold is marketed as &quot;a white, sharp cheddar with a taste that resembles Swiss or Gouda&quot; and is &quot;aged for at least one year.&quot; Cougar Cheese also comes in other varieties, including American Cheddar, Smoky Cheddar, Viking, Dill Garlic, Sweet Basil, Hot Pepper and Crimson Fire.</p>
<p>Washington State University Press each year publishes an average of eight titles that focus on the <a>American West</a>, with particular emphasis on the prehistory, history, environment, politics, and culture of the <a>greater Northwest region</a>. A member of the <a>Association of American University Presses</a>, the WSU Press publishes in varied genres, including scholarly and trade monographs, reminiscences, essays, biographies and works that tell the story of the West in innovative ways.</p>
<p>Through the Center for Civic Engagement on the Pullman campus, students participate in an estimated 30,000 hours annually of credit and non-credit service activities in the community.</p>
<p>In 2008, the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> granted WSU its Community Engagement elective classification, both for curricular engagement and for outreach and partnerships.</p>
<h3>Museums and Collections</h3>
<p>The Museum of Art/WSU has several permanent collections, including the Ernest O. Holland Collection given by the university's fourth president and the Charles Orton Collection, given by a former regent. Others are the Goya and Daumier Collections, Chaplin Woodcuts, Consortium Collections, Meyer Shapiro Print Collection, Elwood Collection and Marian E. Smith Collection of Northwest glass art. Other permanent collections contain works by Northwest artists D. Griffin, Mark Tobey, Kenneth Callahan, Margaret Tomkins, and former faculty members from WSU and the University of Washington.</p>
<p>The university also has an extensive collection of <a>outdoor art</a> on its Pullman campus. Pieces range from a life-size bronze book-figure &quot;Bookin'&quot; by Terry Allen to &quot;Palouse Columns&quot; by Robert Maki to &quot;Technicolor Heart,&quot; a fourteen-foot painted bronze work by <a>Jim Dine</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2005 the Museum of Art began organizing its own traveling exhibitions.  These exhibitions, including works by <a>Roy Lichtenstein</a>, Gaylen Hansen, and <a>Chris Jordan</a>, have been seen across the country.  Between 2005 and 2011, exhibitions organized by the Museum of Art will have traveled to 20 museums in 11 states, and will have been seen by more than 300,000 people.  The Museum has also published six trade books since 2004. The Museum of Art's latest exhibition publication, <em>Running the Numbers, an American self-portrait</em>, features essays by Chris Bruce, Paul Hawken and Lucy R. Lippard.</p>
<p>Several other museums and collections are found on the WSU Pullman campus. One of the largest is the Charles R. Conner Museum of Natural History, exhibiting more than 700 mounts of birds and mammals, and possessing more than 65,000 research specimens. The Connor Museum has its roots in an 1894 gift of the state of Washington's exhibits from the Chicago's World's Fair, encouraged by then President of the Board of Regents Charles R. Conner. Located on the first floor of Abelson Hall, the museum is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except major holidays.</p>
<p>The Museum of Anthropology, with archaeological and ethnographic collections, also draws visitors. Open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday during the school year, the museum has varied exhibits and special events. It also has a collection of objects representing the culture of Native American tribes in the Inland Northwest, and is an official repository for archaeological collections from Eastern Washington.</p>
<p>Also at WSU are the Harold E. Culver Collection, with fossils of pre-historic animals; the Lyle and Lela Jacklin Collection of Silicified Wood &amp; Minerals; and S. Elroy McCaw Fluorescent Mineral Display. Research collections include an Historic Costume and Textiles Collection, the Maurice T. James Entomological Collection, the Marion Ownbey Herbarium, the Mycological Herbarium, and the Henry W. Smith Soil Monolith Collection.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Student life on WSU's Pullman campus is influenced by a variety of student organizations and their committees. For example, the ASWSU Committees are the lifeblood of that association. Open to all students, they create educational, entertaining and cultural programming for WSU students and the local community. Committees include Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (APASC), Black Student Union (BSU), Election Board, Environmental Task Force (ETF), Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender &amp; Allies (GLBTA), Homecoming Committee, Housing Commission, International Students' Council (ISC), Ku Ah Mah, KZUU Radio, Middle Eastern Students Association (MESA), Movimiento Estudianti Chicano de Aztian (MEChA), Student Entertainment Board (SEB), Student Legal Services (SLS), Veteran&#x2019;s Affairs and Washington Student Lobby (WSL). All ASWSU committees are members of &quot;Committee Squared,&quot; the coalition of all ASWSU Committee leaders.</p>
<p>There are several other influential student organizations. Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Greek Presidents' Council are governmental bodies for university-recognized Greek social houses. The Residence Hall Association is a government body for students in the residence halls, governing all of the residence halls on campus excluding McEachern Hall. It is the second biggest Registered Student Organization at Washington State, representing about 4,700 on campus resident students.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Students' Book Corporation oversees the non-profit campus bookstore with over $17 million in annual revenue. The Students' Book Corporation donates all profits back to WSU students. The Student Services &amp; Activities Fees Committee disperses over $6 million annually from a student-imposed fee to student events and programs. The Compton Union Board oversees the management of the <a>student union</a> building and its services. The University Recreation Board oversees the management of university recreation. The ASWSU Student Entertainment Board brings in high-profile speakers and musicians to campus. The Student Alumni Connection hosts several major campus events.</p>
<p>The Coalition for Women Students provides much of the multicultural programs on campus, including the annual Women of Color symposium, the Week Without Violence, and <a>Take Back the Night</a> rally and march. CWS is made up of Association for Pacific and Asian Women, Black Women's Caucus, Mujeres Unidas, Native American Women's Association, and the <a>YWCA</a> of WSU. The organization also funds the all-volunteer Women's Transit, a safe door-to-door transportation program for women who would otherwise walk alone at night.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The <a>Pullman</a> campus of Washington State University is 620 acres (2.5&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) and is located in the <a>Palouse</a> region, seven miles (11&nbsp;km) west of the <a>Idaho</a>  border and <a>Moscow</a>, home of the <a>University of Idaho</a>.</p>
<p>The Palouse is defined by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which supports one of the world's most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are <a>wheat</a>, <a>peas</a>, <a>barley</a>, and <a>lentils</a>. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular blue-pink sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college's colors (later changed to the current <a>crimson</a> and <a>gray</a> colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.</p>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p><a>Thompson Hall|thumb</a> Most campus buildings are red brick and can be characterized as utilitarian, a fitting style for the land-grant university work ethic and standards of fiduciary prudence. The most dramatic campus building is the recently named Terrell Library with its curving sweep of windows and a cone-shaped skylight above its atrium. It opened in 1994. Another dramatic structure is the Samuel H. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, opened in 2002 and named for WSU's president from 1985&#x2013;2000.</p>
<p>The heart of campus is the <a>Glenn Terrell</a> Friendship Mall, referred to as &quot;the mall&quot; by students. This walkway was named after Glenn Terrell, who was WSU's president from 1967 to 1985. President Terrell's secretary was known to set meetings 10 minutes behind schedule to make up for the time he would spend talking to students along the way. The library, student union, and a number of classroom buildings surround the Mall.</p>
<p>The football stadium, <a>Martin Stadium</a>, named after former Washington Governor Clarence D. Martin, also figures prominently on campus. The stadium, the smallest in the <a>Pac-10</a>, is situated in the core of the campus with the south grandstands built into the Hill (the Information Technology building is part of the south grandstands), and Terrell Library and the Vogel Plant BioSciences buildings overlooking the west and east ends, respectively. Even though it is the smallest in the Pac-10, it offers the most seating to students in the Pac-10. After the conclusion of the 2006 football season, Martin Stadium went under a massive renovation to expand the seating capacity and offer greater amenities for players and spectators, as well as made improvements to the general facilities such as bathrooms and concession stands.</p>
<p><a>Bryan Hall, with landmark clock tower|thumb</a></p>
<p>Other exceptions to the utilitarian architectural style are Thompson Hall, Bryan Hall, and Stevens Hall, the oldest buildings on campus. Thompson Hall was the original administration building, and is now the home of the foreign language department. Bryan Hall is the landmark building on campus with the tall four-sided tower enclosing a carillon and displaying a clock that lights up neon-red in the evening. Stevens Hall is an all-women's dormitory pitched with many gables. Stevens Hall and Thompson Hall are on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>Also notable are the Lewis Alumni Centre and the Webster Physical Science Building. Lewis is an old beef cattle barn renovated in 1989 to be the most luxurious building on campus, with hand-made rugs, palm trees, Italian marble, and beautiful artwork. Rooms in Lewis include the Board of Regents' Boardroom, Lighty Library, the Athletics Hall of Fame, the Alumni Presidents' Room, and the Great Hall for large social events. Webster is the tallest building on campus with twelve above-ground floors of offices and an expansive view of the region from the roof.</p>
<p>From 1911 to 1923, <a>Rudolph Weaver</a> was the first chairman of the architecture department. He designed seven buildings on the WSU campus, including: </p>
<h3>Residential campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Stimson Hall</a> WSU is a residential campus. Many freshmen live in residence halls, while some live in fraternity and sorority houses or in off-campus housing. After their first year, many students move to apartments, several owned by WSU. Most apartments are less than a half-mile from campus. Apartment renters have the benefit of the Pullman Transit system, noted for moving more people per mile of transit than any other bus system in the U.S.; parking spaces on campus are limited.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>A number of the residence halls are <a>co-ed</a>, but there are single-gender living environments as well as a variety of other living options that include age-restricted housing, a mix of domestic and international students, and a global learning community. All of the residence halls, except for McEachern, are part of the <a>RHA</a> (Residence Hall Association).</p>
<p>Residence halls on campus include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Hill Halls: Duncan-Dunn, Community, Honors, McCroskey, Wilmer-Davis and Stevens</li>
  <li>The Northside Halls: Regents Hill, Scott-Coman and Streit-Perham</li>
  <li>The South Central Halls: Gannon-Goldsworthy, Stimson and Waller</li>
  <li>The Upper Division Halls: Rogers, Orton and McEachern</li>
  <li>The Complex: Stephenson East, Stephenson North and Stephenson South</li>
  <li>Opened in Fall 2009: Olympia</li>

<p>Each hall has its own government which organizes events, manages its budget, and acts as a forum for student involvement. These halls range in size from the exclusive Stevens Hall (approximately 70 residents), to the massive Stephenson Complex (approximately 1200 residents total). The highlight of the year for the residence halls is often <a>Homecoming</a> Week when the residence halls, off-campus students, and <a>Greeks</a> compete in various events. Events such as the chariot race determine the winner of Homecoming Week. In the past decade, the winner of Homecoming Week has most often been a residence hall team. In 2008, the Residence Halls swept Homecoming. Waller/Wilmer-Davis/Stevens took first, Scott-Coman took second and Stimson/Regents took third.</p>
<h3>College Hill and Greek Row</h3>
<p>There are currently 26 fraternities and 14 sororities at WSU. <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, the first national fraternity at WSU, celebrated its <a>centennial</a> on the Pullman campus on March 6, 2009. <a>Alpha Delta Pi</a> was the first sorority at WSU it was established in 1912. A Greek Life Centennial 1909&#x2013;2009 for all chapters and alumni was planned for September 14&#x2013;19, 2009. Between 15-20 percent of undergraduate students are in the <a>Greek community</a> annually. Greek Row is situated on College Hill just downhill from Bryan Hall and the Hill Halls (the historic single-gender dormitories) on the WSU campus, and among the homes of faculty, Greek live-outs, and apartment buildings. The Greek Row and College Hill area is a diverse community of students, faculty members, and families (including the President's House). A restaurants, thrift stores and various bars line Colorado Street, the main street on College Hill.</p>
<h3>Recreation and the outdoors</h3>
<p>The university has  Student Recreation Center (SRC), which was the largest student recreation center in the United States when it was opened in 2001. The SRC contains a one-eighth mile elevated indoor track, four basketball courts, two volleyball courts, roller hockey rink, four racquetball courts, swimming pool, 50-person jacuzzi, free weights, weight machines, cardio equipment, exercise instruction rooms, outdoor sand volleyball courts, and a low to high ropes course. The campus also has several other basketball courts, dance rooms, a climbing wall, and the Outdoor Recreation Center where students can check out equipment or register for various events and trips. A seven mile (11&nbsp;km) paved trail links <a>Pullman</a> with <a>Moscow, ID</a> and a bike trail that wraps around the Pullman campus (about eight miles (13&nbsp;km) long). The school has an intramural program, and club sports are also very popular on campus. The campus has a 7,305-yard championship golf course named Palouse Ridge, a $12.3 million project opened on August 29, 2008, intended to improve the school's golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni a new reason to visit the campus. It replaces a sub standard 9-hole course built in 1923 and little improved prior to closure in 2006, to make room for Palouse Ridge, on the same site and adjacent land.</p>
<p>Within , many students have the option to hike at <a>Kamiak Butte</a> and <a>Steptoe Butte</a>. Moscow Mountain provides opportunities for hiking and mountain biking. For aquatic adventures, students can cliff jump or boat at the <a>Snake River</a>. Farther out, white-river rafting, downhill skiing, and hiking in the nearby foothills of the <a>Rocky Mountains</a> are available.</p>
<h3>Arboretum and Botanical Garden</h3>
<p>The WSU Arboretum Committee continues to develop an Arboretum and Botanical Garden on a hilltop adjacent to the Lewis Alumni Center. In addition, about  on the east edge of campus has been identified for a more expansive Arboretum and Botanical Garden, including a wildlife center. Students interested in contributing to the development of the WSU Arboretum are working with the Native Plant &amp; Landscape Restoration Nursery to help establish tree plantings, future habitat restoration sites, or native plant displays that may be part of a campus green belt design.</p>
<h3>Tourism</h3>
<p>The number of tourists varies depending on the time of year. Busy times at the Pullman campus include Dad's Weekend in the fall, Mom's Weekend in the spring, and Cougar sporting events throughout the year. Noteworthy is the Apple Cup football game, the annual rivalry game between the Washington Huskies and the Washington State Cougars, played every other year in Pullman. Dad's and Mom's weekends, Homecoming, the beginning and end of the school year (late August, early May), and December and May commencements are busy weekends for Pullman. WSU is among the co-sponsors of Pullman's annual <a>National Lentil Festival</a> that attracts many visitors on the weekend before university classes begin in August.</p>
<p>Martin Stadium, the Cougars' football stadium, holds more than 35,000 spectators, which makes it the smallest stadium in the PAC-10 conference, but still allows it to hold 125 percent of Pullman's population, including the nearly 20,000 student population. Beasley Performing Arts Coliseum, where the men's and women's basketball teams play, holds 12,000, which is more than 40 percent of the city's population.</p>
<p>During the fall, events such as Fall Preview and Future Cougar Day invite high school students to visit campus and learn about the university. These usually include visits with academic departments, official welcomes from faculty and administrators, and campus tours from current students. Events in the spring such as Destination WSU focus on younger students, high school juniors and sophomores. The university also has a &quot;Welcome Center,&quot; open most days, that lets prospective students get information about the school, campus tours, and directions to campus resources and departments.</p>
<p>The WSU Visitor's Center in an historic railroad station in downtown Pullman assists tourists and campus visitors with campus maps, directions, information and parking permits.</p>
<h2>School of Music</h2>
<p>Established in 1901, the School of Music at Washington State University is recognized for excellence in undergraduate and graduate studies in music. WSU has an internationally recognized faculty and offers degrees in Performance, Music Education and Composition and degrees which combine music with studies in Jazz and Business. Physical facilities at WSU include the beautiful, renovated Kimbrough Music Building containing an extensive music listening library, professional quality recording and electronic music studio, a concert hall, large ensemble rehearsal rooms, practice rooms and classrooms. In addition, the Music Program utilizes excellent stage facilities in Bryan Hall, featuring an 800 seat auditorium, a production shop, piano and instrument repair shops, and a three manual, 44-rank Schantz pipe organ. Director of the WSU School of Music is Dr. Gerald Berthiaume.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Washington State University is a member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>. The school's mascot is &quot;<a>Butch T. Cougar</a>&quot; and the school's colors are crimson and gray. Varsity athletics include men's <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>golf</a>, and <a>track and field</a>, as well as women's basketball, cross country, golf, <a>rowing</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>tennis</a>, and <a>track and field</a>. In the past WSU had varsity programs of <a>boxing</a>, <a>wrestling</a>, <a>gymnastics</a>, and men's <a>swimming</a>. In 1917, WSU won its first National Championship in Men's Basketball. In 1937, Roy Petragallo and Ed McKinnon won the NCAA boxing championship, another national championship. The Cougars third and most recent National Championship was earned in 1977 Indoor Track and Field.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Martin Stadium, home of Cougars football</a> University Recreation also supports 26 club sports, including <a>bowling</a>, men's <a>crew</a>, <a>cricket</a>, <a>cycling</a>, <a>equestrian</a> show team, men's and women's <a>flag football</a>, <a>fencing</a>, <a>polo</a>, <a>men's</a> and women's <a>ice hockey</a>, <a>judo</a>, men's <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>logger sports</a>, <a>rodeo</a>, men's <a>rugby union</a>, women's rugby, <a>sailing</a>, <a>ski</a> team, men's soccer, women's fast-pitch softball, <a>taekwondo</a>, <a>triathlon</a>, <a>Ultimate</a>, men's and women's volleyball, <a>water polo</a> and <a>wrestling</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:martinstadium3.jpg|thumb|right|Cougar fans celebrate on the field after the [[Apple Cup]] win in 2004.]] Washington State's biggest rival is the <a>University of Washington</a> <a>Huskies</a>. Strong rivalries also exist between WSU and the other Pac-10 teams of the Pacific Northwest: the <a>University of Oregon</a> <a>Ducks</a> and <a>Oregon State University</a> <a>Beavers</a>. WSU's closest geographic rival is the <a>University of Idaho</a>, a fellow land-grant school only eight miles east of Pullman across the state line in <a>Moscow</a>. Their rivalry football game, the &quot;<a>Battle of the Palouse</a>&quot;, was played on an annual basis from 1901 until 1978 when the NCAA Division I split. After Idaho returned to Division I-A, a renewed battle lasted from 1998 until 2007, but was dropped from the schedule due to the Cougars' continued dominance of the <a>Vandals</a> in the series, and each school's ability to generate more revenue by playing other opponents.</p>
<p>Acting as a liaison between the athletes and the athletic administration, the Student Athlete Advisory Committee is an active part of Cougar athletics. The Committee, composed of two athletes from every sports team and a few athletic administrators, discusses issues relevant to WSU athletes and legislative changes in the NCAA.</p>
<p>During the 2006&#x2013;07 season, the once-moribund Cougar men's basketball team achieved unprecedented success, including its first Top 10 ranking under then first-year head coach Tony Bennett, reaching as high as #9 in the <a>AP poll</a> on 2-20-07. During the 2007&#x2013;2008 season, the Cougar men's basketball team reached the Sweet Sixteen after beating Winthrop and Notre Dame, before losing to #1 Seeded UNC.</p>
<p>On March 1, 2007, Washington State was awarded a banner for its 1917 NCAA National Basketball Championship prior to its home game against UCLA. The championship was recently approved by the NCAA. In 1941, Coach Jack Friel led the Cougars to the basketball championship game, losing to Wisconsin 39-34. The Cougars are also fighting for the 1915 National Football Championship.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2007, after leading his team to a 26-8 record, 2nd place in the Pac-10 and to their first tournament appearance in over a decade, then Head Coach <a>Tony Bennett</a> was awarded the prestigious AP Coach of the Year award, receiving 40 of a possible 72 votes. Bennett also was awarded the Naismith Award by the Atlanta Tip of Club. This was Bennett's sixth major coach of the year award for the 2006&#x2013;2007 season (the Associated Press, The Sporting News, United States Basketball Writers Association, Basketball Times, and CBS/Chevrolet, and the Naismith Award). This is the most major awards won by a Pacific-10 Conference coach in a single season, surpassing UCLA legend <a>John Wooden's</a> five in 1972.</p>
<p>Bennett had agreed to renew his contract with WSU for an additional seven years (extending his contract until 2014). On March 30, 2009, however, Bennett shocked the Cougar faithful by accepting the head men's coaching position at the <a>University of Virginia</a>. On April 6, 2009, WSU announced former <a>Portland State University</a> men's head coach <a>Ken Bone</a> as the new head coach of the Cougars.</p>
<p>On April 20, 2007, Washington State hired the recently fired <a>Washington Huskies</a> women's basketball coach <a>June Daugherty</a> as the new head coach of the women's basketball team. This is just the second time a head coach has switched schools in the history of their rivalry. Daugherty was fired by the University of Washington less than a month earlier despite leading the Huskies to six NCAA Women's Tournaments, including her last season at the school.</p>
<p><a>Paul Wulff</a> began his second season as WSU head football coach when the Cougars took on the <a>Stanford Cardinal</a> on September 5, 2009, at <a>Martin Stadium</a> in Pullman.  The university's  31st head football coach, Wulff is the first WSU graduate and football letter-winner since Phil Sarboe to lead the Cougars.</p>
<p>On Sept. 22, 2009, then WSU Athletic Director Jim Sterk launched the &quot;TeamBuilt&quot; fund drive for Phase III of the <a>Martin Stadium</a> renovation to add luxury suites, club seats and loge boxes atop the north stands. On Feb. 15, 2010, San Diego  State University announced Jim Sterk as their new athletic director.</p>
<p>On Feb. 24, 2010, President Elson S. Floyd announced the appointment of William &quot;Bill&quot; Moos as WSU's next athletic director, beginning no later than May 1. Anne McCoy, senior associate athletic director is serving as interim athletic director. A three-year letterman in football for the Cougars, Moos was on the WSU athletic staff from 1982&#x2013;1990, then was athletic director for the University of Montana and the University of Oregon.</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events (such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic events) is &quot;Win the Day&quot;, which is more commonly known as the Washington State University <a>Fight Song</a>.  The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fight, fight, fight for Washington State! Win the victory! We're gonna win the day for Crimson and Gray! Best in the West, we know you'll all do your best, so On, on, on, on! Fight to the end! Honor and Glory you must win! So Fight, fight, fight for Washington State and victory!</p>
  <p>W-A-S-H-I-N-G-T-O-N-S-T-A-T-E-C-O-U-G-S! GO COUGS!!</p>
</blockquote>
