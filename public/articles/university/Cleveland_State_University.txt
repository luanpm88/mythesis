<p><strong>Cleveland State University</strong> (otherwise known as <strong>Cleveland State</strong> or <strong>CSU</strong>) is a comprehensive, urban university located in downtown <a>Cleveland</a>, <a>Ohio</a>. It was established in 1964 as a state-assisted university to provide public higher education for citizens of <a>greater Cleveland</a> and northeast Ohio. In that first year, the University acquired the buildings, faculty, staff and programs of Fenn College, a private institution of 2,500 students, and the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law merged with CSU in 1969.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<pre>  </pre>
<h3>Cleveland YMCA</h3>
<p>The origins of Cleveland State University date back to 1870 when the Cleveland <a>Young Men&#x2019;s Christian Association</a> initiated its educational program by offering free evening classes in French and German. Following a period of sporadic course offering in the 1870&#x2019;s, the YMCA&#x2019;s evening educational program became firmly established in the 1880&#x2019;s. In 1906 the YMCA combined its newly created day school with the evening school under the name of the Association Institute.</p>
<p>Four different day schools were established in 1909: The School of Commerce and Finance, The Technical School, The Preparatory School, and the Special School (dropped in 1913). The first female students were admitted in 1918. In 1921 the YMCA&#x2019;s educational branch was re-named the Cleveland YMCA School of Technology.</p>
<p>Finding a demand, the YMCA began offering its first college credit classes in engineering and business in 1923. Classes were conducted at the Central YMCA building on Prospect Avenue and East 22nd Street and three converted residences on Prospect adjacent to the Central YMCA: the Johnson Building; the Edwards Building, and the Medical Building.</p>
<p>Two significant events marked 1927. The first college class graduated, and planning began for a junior college program that became the Nash Junior College in 1931. In 1928 the first building built exclusively for the college, the Fenn Building, was constructed next to the YMCA, behind the Johnson Building. The need to achieve accreditation led the YMCA to re-organize its education program in 1929.</p>
<h3>Fenn College</h3>
<p>In 1929, the school's name was changed to Fenn College, officially in honor of Sereno Peck Fenn, who had served as president of the Cleveland YMCA for 25 years and as a Board Director, 1868-1920.</p>
<p>The Preparatory School and the Nash Junior College ceased operations in 1935 as a School of Arts and Science was added to the Engineering and Business Administration schools. With several prestigious private colleges, including Case Institute of Technology and <a>Western Reserve University</a> nearby, Fenn College focused on students for whom college otherwise would be financially unattainable by offering a low-cost quality education. In line with this policy Fenn College became the second college in Ohio, after the <a>University of Cincinnati</a>, to adopt the cooperative education program. This program of alternating classroom work with actual employment was required for all day students and was optional for evening division students.</p>
<p>In 1937, Fenn College purchased the National Town and Country Club building at Euclid Avenue and East 24th Street. Renamed Fenn Tower in 1939, it provided needed classroom and office space. It additionally gave the college a more prestigious &#x201c;Euclid Avenue&#x201d; address. Fenn&#x2019;s reputation was further enhanced when it received accreditation from the North Central Association in 1940. </p>
<p>Dr. Cecil Vincent Thomas, who served simultaneously as the YMCA&#x2019;s Executive Director and as Fenn&#x2019;s first President, 1930-1947, was responsible for Fenn&#x2019;s early development. During the administration of Dr. Edward Hodnett, 1948-1951, Fenn constructed Foster Hall, an engineering building financed by a donation by Cleveland entrepreneur Claude Foster, and at the recommendation of the North Central Association, separated its operations from the YMCA. In 1953 Fenn expanded again purchasing the Ohio Motors building on East 24th Street. Renovated for classroom use the building was dedicated in 1959 as Stilwell Hall in honor of Board Chairman Charles Stilwell.</p>
<p>By 1963, increasing operating costs, competition from the new community college, and rumors of a possible state takeover had placed Fenn in severe financial straits. That year the college released a plan for Unified Higher Education in Cleveland-Northeastern Ohio, calling upon the State to develop a state university in Cleveland using Fenn College as its nucleus.</p>
<p>During James Rhodes&#x2019; 1962 campaign for governor, he proposed that there should be a state university within a 30 mile radius of every citizen. At that time the nearest state university to Cleveland was Kent State. On 18 December 1964, Governor Rhodes signed legislation creating Ohio&#x2019;s seventh state university, Cleveland State University, and announced the appointment of a board of trustees with James Nance as chairman.</p>
<h3>Cleveland State</h3>
<p>Negotiating committees from Fenn and CSU reached an agreement in April 1965 whereby the State would take control of Fenn College, its facilities and personnel on September 1, 1965. Dr. Harry Newburn served as acting president until the appointment of Dr. Harold Enarson as CSU&#x2019;s first president in February 1966. Dr. Newburn returned in 1972 as interim president until the appointment of Dr. Walter Waetjen as CSU&#x2019;s second president in 1973.</p>
<p>Faced with the demographics of a stagnating or declining pool of college age students, the University undertook several major projects to improve student services and retention during the administration of Dr. Claire Van Ummersen, 1993-2001. Improvements included the conversion to the semester system in 1998 and the implementation of a modern information technology infrastructure. While attempting to update its computer system the University encountered delays and substantial increased costs in implementing the computer software that was supposed to allow the University to integrate its various administrative functions. This, combined with a period of decreasing levels of financial support from the State of Ohio resulted in a rapid increase in tuition and has limited program development and improvements. In the latter half of the 1990&#x2019;s the campus continued to grow with the opening of the Health Sciences Center (1997), Monte Ahuja Hall (2001) and the Urban Affairs College building (2001).</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p><a>Ronald M. Berkman</a> is the current president.  Geoffrey Mearns, former dean of the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, was named <a>provost</a>, as permanent replacement for Mary Jane Saunders, who resigned in 2010.</p>
<h3>Presidents</h3>
<p> On April 26, 2009, Dr. Ronald M. Berkman was named as the sixth President of Cleveland State University.</p>
<h2>Board of Trustees</h2>
<p>The Cleveland State University Board of Trustees consists of nine (9) trustees, a Secretary to the Board, two faculty representatives, and two student representatives.  The board members, along with the University President, are charged with fulfilling the goals set forth in the University Mission Statement as well as acting as the governing body in all policy matters of the University requiring attention.  In January, 2006 the Board of Trustees amended their bylaws so that they could restructure board committees as well as include Community members on the Board.  Community members serve as non-voting advisers and are appointed by the Board Chairman for a term approved by the Board.  </p>

<h3>Cleveland-Marshall College of Law</h3>
<p> [[Image:Cleveland Marshall College of Law.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cleveland-Marshall College of Law]]]] The Cleveland-Marshall College of Law traces its origins to the founding of Cleveland Law School in 1897 as the first evening law school in the state and one of the first in Ohio (and one of the earliest in the U.S.) to admit women and minorities.  In 1946, Cleveland Law School merged with the John Marshall School of Law, founded in 1916, to become Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Cleveland-Marshall became part of Cleveland State University in 1969. </p>
<p>One of the most famous alumni of the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law was <a>Tim Russert</a>, host of <a>television program</a> <em><a>Meet the Press</a></em>. The college has also educated numerous highly esteemed judges and founders of prestigious private law firms. Due to its long tradition of providing evening education, the college has a large number of business and community leaders who are non-practicing attorneys as well.</p>

<h2>Location, Campus, and Community</h2>
<p>[[Image:CSU Rhodes Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rhodes Tower]]]]</p>
<p>CSU's main campus in <a>downtown Cleveland</a> is bounded on the east and west by <a>Interstate 90</a> and 17th Street, respectively; and by Payne Avenue to the north and Carnegie Avenue on the south. It also has satellite campuses in <a>Westlake, Ohio</a> and <a>Solon, Ohio</a>, both in the <a>Greater Cleveland</a> <a>metropolitan area</a> in <a>Cuyahoga County</a>. As of fall 2010, the student body totaled 17,204.</p>
<h3>Expansion Plans</h3>
<p>CSU recently unveiled a long-term plan to make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus by building thousands of housing units, anchored by a new dormitory, <a>Fenn Tower</a>, a reuse of the school's most historic building.  The university is working with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and &quot;collegetown&quot; amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly the main thoroughfare of <a>Euclid Avenue</a>, scheduled to be destroyed and upgraded as part of the Euclid Corridor Project, bringing <a>bus rapid transit</a> to the university and </p>
<p>The University has also recently completed a new state of the art student recreation center, as well as two new buildings for the Colleges of Graduate Studies and Education; there are longer-term plans to create a &quot;Varsity Village&quot; incorporating athletic fields and student housing into a green, residential area.  </p>
<p>Fenn Tower formerly housed what was at one time the longest <a>Foucault pendulum</a> in the world; however, the pendulum has been inoperational since 1980 and was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006. The pendulum currently resides in the Cleveland State University archives.</p>
<p>The Dramatic Arts Program is in the process of transitioning into the <a>Allen Theatre</a> at <a>Playhouse Square Center</a> in collaboration with the <a>Cleveland Play House</a>.</p>
<p>In 2009, Cleveland State University announced their plan  to begin work on $65 million construction project, this project will transform the campus from a commuter school into a residential campus. The construction plans include the new Student Center and Julka Hull, completed in 2010, and more residential areas in Euclid Commons, which are still under construction.</p>
<h3>Student Media</h3>
<p>The campus' student-run radio station, 89.3 <a>WCSB</a>-FM, has a 630-<a>Watt</a> <a>transmitter</a> on top of <a>Rhodes Tower</a> (formerly called University Tower).  Additionally, Cleveland State is served in print by <a>The Cauldron</a>, an independent student newspaper, <a>The Cleveland Stater</a>, a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication, The Vindicator, and The Gavel which won the 2005 American Bar Association's -Student Division's first prize for the best law school newspaper in the country.  There is no student television station at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center.</p>
<h3>Information Technology</h3>
<p>CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) <a>computer network</a>, an initiative of <a>Case Western Reserve University</a> that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network.</p>
<h2>Intercollegiate Athletics</h2>
<p> &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: <a>right|80px|thumb|Old CSU logo &quot;Vike&quot;</a>  --&gt; When the school was still known as Fenn College, the <a>sports team</a>s' <a>nickname</a> was the <a>Foxes</a>. When the University was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU's sports teams became the &quot;Vikings&quot;. That nickname stands to this day. The <a>school colors</a> are forest green and white.  For many years the school mascot was the <a>comic strip</a> character <a>H&#x00e4;gar the Horrible</a> along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, &quot;Vike&quot; was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was gradually phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named &quot;Magnus&quot; was introduced in August 2007.</p>
<p>Cleveland State fields <a>varsity</a> teams in seventeen sports.  Most of the teams compete in the <a>Horizon League</a>.  The <a>men's basketball team</a> was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>tournament</a>, it upset heavily favored 3-seed <a>Indiana</a> and <a>St. Joseph's</a> before being beaten by <a>Navy</a> by one point, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4th seeded <a>Wake Forest</a> before falling to the <a>University of Arizona</a> in the second round.</p>
<h3>Fielding a Football Team</h3>
<p>On October 14, 2008 CSU President Michael Schwartz stated &quot;he wants a blue ribbon panel to give him a recommendation on the <a>football</a> team before July 1, 2009, when he is scheduled to retire. He also said the program will have to be structured to pay for itself.&quot;</p>
<p>The Football establishment issue became an official item on the Cleveland State University, Student Government Association election ballot. From Monday April 12 at 12:01 AM until Friday April 14 the student body voted on the issue. By the Friday evening, the results indicated that  &#x0009; 68.7% of the student population favored establishment of a football team. Furthermore the student body was asked if they were willing to pay a fee for Division 1 non-scholarship football in addition to any potential, future tuition increases that may be instituted by the University. The student body responded 55.6% of the vote as no.</p>
<p>Currently, the university is studying the possibility of establishing a football team, Division I non-scholarship in the University and further reports will be released in the upcoming years.</p>
