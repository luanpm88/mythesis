<p><strong>The College at Brockport: State University of New York</strong>, also known as <strong>SUNY Brockport</strong>, <strong>Brockport State</strong>, <strong>College at Brockport</strong>, or the <strong>State University of New York at Brockport</strong>, is a four-year liberal arts college located in <a>Brockport</a>, <a>Monroe County</a>, <a>New York</a>, near <a>Rochester</a>. A constituent college of the <a>State University of New York</a>, it has been ranked by U.S. News in the first tier of Master's-granting colleges in the Northeast region, and by Kiplinger's among the top 100 &quot;Best Value&quot; public colleges and universities in the United States. Among its faculty are several Fulbright scholars, three Distinguished Professors, and a winner of the 2006 Flannery O'Connor award for fiction.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, The College at Brockport has become one of the most selective of the SUNY comprehensive colleges, with an acceptance rate of 41.9% as of 2007. Average SAT scores have risen from 1,029 ('97) to 1,115 ('06), and high-school averages have increased from 84.4 ('97) to 90.5 ('06).

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumbnail|right|450px|Hartwell Hall</a> The College at Brockport opened as the Brockport Collegiate Institute in 1841, and later became the Brockport State Normal School in 1866.</p>
<p>The last Normal School class graduated in 1942 after which the school officially became a college, meaning it could grant the <a>bachelor's degree</a>. (Normal School graduates received only a certificate of study when they finished, which entitled them to teach in the <a>New York</a> State schools.) This enhancement of status was due in good part to the efforts of President Ernest Hartwell, who, like Malcolm MacVicar and many other <a>Brockport</a> figures, played a leading role in the education movements of the time. Starting as Brockport State Teachers College, the new school was automatically included in the new SUNY system which was established in 1948.</p>
<p>The years after <a>World War II</a> were a time of tremendous growth for <a>higher education</a>, as thousands of veterans went to college on the <a>G.I. Bill</a>. Brockport began a period of expansion in that time that was unprecedented in the school's history.</p>
<p>When Donald Tower became president of the school in 1944, the entire campus was what's now called Hartwell Hall. There were a few hundred students and the faculty and staff numbered under 50 people. The sole purpose of the school was to train elementary school teachers. By the time he (Tower) retired in 1964 there were several thousand students and several hundred faculty and staff members. The campus had expanded greatly, adding residence halls and a college union, and expanding across Kenyon Street and down Holley Street. The purpose and organization of the College had also grown, as it evolved into a liberal arts college with a number of master's degree programs. The first graduate degree was awarded in January 1950. By 1981, there were 1,185 graduate students enrolled in 11 different programs. Today, SUNY Brockport has more than 1,800 graduate students enrolled in 26 programs.</p>
<p>In the early years of President Albert Brown (1965&#x2013;1981), the school's growth rate built to a height of activity, seeing the high-rise residence halls, library and other buildings rise up to make the campus that one sees today. The school continued to evolve in the last years of the 20th century under the leadership of President John Van De Wetering (1981&#x2013;1997), who launched the MetroCenter, SUNY Brockport's classroom complex in downtown Rochester. During his tenure, Brockport's international education program greatly expanded to become the largest in the SUNY system and among the 10 largest in the U.S.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2004, under the leadership of <a>Paul Yu</a>&#x2014;working closely with faculty, staff and students&#x2014;SUNY Brockport achieved new levels of excellence and recognition, from acquiring the latest information technologies to improving campus communications to increasing admissions standards. Brockport became recognized throughout New York and within the SUNY system both as innovative and dynamic. Noteworthy achievements included: an increase in average <a>SAT</a> scores from 1002 in 1998 to 1071 in 2004, increase in first-year retention rate from 71 percent in 1998 to 83 percent in 2004, and an increase in funded faculty research grants from $3.5 million in 1999 to $5.7 million in 2004.</p>
<p>In August 2005, <a>Dr. John R. Halstead</a> became the SUNY Brockport&#x2019;s sixth president. Dr. Halstead brings a range of leadership experience to SUNY Brockport including a seven-year term as president of <a>Mansfield University of Pennsylvania</a>, several vice president positions and post-doctoral work at <a>Harvard University</a>'s Institute of Educational Management. He has met and developed relationships with numerous government, corporate and community leaders to increase SUNY Brockport&#x2019;s visibility in the region and formed partnerships to further promote student success. He was inaugurated on April 7, 2006.</p>
<p>There are two renowned statues on the Brockport Campus. In 1978, Dr. Albert W. Brown presented Soviet artist <a>Zurab Tsereteli</a> with an honorary certificate in recognition of his efforts to foster peace and understanding between people of the Soviet Union and the United States. He then was invited to teach a painting course here at SUNY Brockport. After accepting the invitation, Tsereteli learned about the Fifth International Summer Special Olympics Games, to be held here at SUNY Brockport in August 1979. He then returned to his native Republic of Georgia. Drawing inspiration from his interest in young people, his concern for Special Olympics and the realization that the United Nations had proclaimed 1979 as the International Year of the Child, Tsereteli began his work. Within a year, Tsereteli constructed two sculptures for the Soviet Government, which were then donated to SUNY Brockport in honor of the International Year of the Child and the International Special Olympics. One of the pieces is located in front of the Allen Administration Building, and is titled &quot;<a>Prometheus</a>&quot; (The Greek god who gave fire to man). The other is located in front of the Drake Memorial Library, and is titled &quot;Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World&quot;. The five pillars represent the five continents that would be represented at the Special Olympics Games in 1979. Tsereteli waived his usual royalties which would have amounted to $250,000 because the pieces were for children and students. The two bronze pieces, whose total weight is nearly 30 tons, were shipped overseas to the United States and then loaded into five trucks to be brought to SUNY Brockport.</p>

<h2>Buildings on Campus</h2>
<p><strong>Allen Administration Building</strong></p>
<p>The Allen Building was built in 1973 and named after <a>Gordon F. Allen</a> who was an education professor, dean and then acting president from 1964-65.</p>
<p>Allen Hall is affectionately referred to as the <em>&quot;power tower&quot;</em> and is used for both administrative and academic purposes. It is home to the Office of the President, central administration, as well as some instructional classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Albert W. Brown Building</strong> (Formerly the Faculty Office Building)</p>
<p>Albert W. Brown (1965&#x2013;1981) presided over SUNY Brockport during a period of rapid change and expansion, as the college grew from 3,000 students to a record of 11,000 students. The Faculty Office Building was one of the major construction projects completed during Brown&#x2019;s tenure. Campus growth at that time included the addition of new library, office, academic, athletic and high-rise residence hall buildings.</p>
<p>The Albert W. Brown Building is connected by pedestrian bridge to the Drake Memorial Library and the Allen Administration building. It houses offices for the deans and associate deans of the School of Letters and Sciences, School of Professions and School of Arts and Performance, as well as faculty offices for 15 academic departments. The Albert W. Brown Building is home to an extensive art collection of paintings, sculpture and photographs on display throughout the building within its .</p>
<p><strong>Alumni House</strong></p>
<p>This Victorian era home was built in the 1860s and bought by the state in 1898 for use as a residence by the principal. Before the house was bought, the principals had lived in an apartment in the school building. David Smith was the first principal to live in the house, and the last was Donald Tower who retired in 1964. In a collection of reminisences of the house published in the AlumNews in 1985 the following memories were shared. Mrs. Clyde Walters, class of 1918, recalled her friendship with Principal Thompson's daughter Miriam and attending Miriam's wedding which was held in the house. Mrs. Fletcher Garlock, granddaughter of Thompson, mentioned that she was born in the house and remembered roller-skating in the kitchen! Both Wilbur McCormick '37 and Bruce Schlageter '47 recalled as undergraduates visiting with Dr. Hartwell in the house to chat about school affairs. After 1964 the building was used for office space and other purposes until in 1976 the Alumni Association acquired the building. The house has been restored and is the site of many alumni and community functions.</p>
<p><strong>Benedict Hall</strong></p>
<p>Benedict Hall was built in 1965 and named after Edgar Benedict (1905&#x2013;1990) who was a longtime member of the Board of Trustees (1945&#x2013;1962). Benedict Hall, along with Gordon, Dobson, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students. This three-story dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents. Benedict Hall currently houses freshmen students.</p>
<p><strong>Bramley Hall</strong></p>
<p>Bramley Hall was built in 1968 and named after Herbert Bramley (1867&#x2013;1945), a longtime member of the Board of Trustees from 1935&#x2013;1945, and a prominent local business person. Bramley Hall, considered one of the high-rise dormitories along with Briggs, Perry, and Mortimer Halls, is home to upperclass students. This dorm was designed to have four suites of six students on each floor. The six students share three bedrooms, a living area, and a bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Briggs Hall</strong></p>
<p>Briggs Hall was built in 1968 and named after Elizabeth Briggs (1885&#x2013;1965) who was a Campus School history teacher at Brockport from 1910-1943. Briggs Hall is part of the high-rise dormitory complex along with Bramley, Perry, and Mortimer Halls, located at the west end of campus. This upperclass student dorm was designed to have four suites of six students on each floor. The six students share three bedrooms, a living area, and a bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Brockway Hall</strong></p>
<p>Brockway Hall was built in 1966 and named after <a>Hiel Brockway</a>, a co-founder of <a>Brockport, New York</a> who in 1836 donated the land on which Hartwell Hall now stands.</p>
<p>Today, the Brockway building serves as a dining hall for student who live in the traditional style dormitories. Brockway Hall also houses the BASC offices and is where new students can receive their photo identification.</p>
<p><strong>Cooper Hall</strong></p>
<p>Cooper Hall was built in 1965 and named after Charles Cooper, the head of the &quot;training&quot; school at Brockport from 1911-1936.</p>
<p>Cooper's background included Millersville State Normal in <a>Pennsylvania</a> and a bachelor's degree from <a>Bucknell University</a>, eventually supplemented by a master's from the Teacher's College at <a>Columbia University</a>. Cooper was intensely interested in the Training School and the athletic program of the Normal School.</p>
<p>Cooper Hall was the home to the Campus School, and was designed with elementary students in mind. However, the Campus School closed in 1981, and today the building serves many functions. The elementary classrooms are still filled with young children, as one wing of the building is home to the Brockport Child Development Center, a <a>NAEYC</a> accredited daycare and preschool. Other classrooms and offices are utilized by the Anthropology Education, and Military Science departments, and other wings belong to the Delta College, Honors Program, and McNair Program.</p>
<p><strong>Dailey Hall</strong></p>
<p>Dailey Hall was built in 1967 and named after Vincent Dailey, a Brockport native and the Chairman of the <a>New York State Democratic Party</a> who played a decisive role in obtaining funds for the construction of Hartwell Hall.</p>
<p>Dailey Hall was constructed as one of three dining halls during the building boom of the late 1960s. In 1992, it became the new home of Academic Computing Services and is the main computer lab on campus today. Its centralized location on campus made the building the logical choice for the primary computer facility, and smaller computer labs. Staff in Cooper and Drake Library were consolidated into the new Dailey Hall facility.</p>
<p><strong>Dobson Hall</strong></p>
<p>Dobson Hall was built in 1965 and named after Thomas Dobson (1852&#x2013;1930) who served on the Board of Trustees from the 1890s until 1930. Dobson was appointed Secretary for the Board of Trustees in 1892, as the successor to Daniel Holmes. He was a druggist by occupation, served as Mayor of the Village and was extremely active in church affairs of St. Luke's and the Masons. Mr. Dobson supported student activities like the lecture series and performances and allowed tickets for these events to be sold in his store.</p>
<p>Dobson Hall, along with Gordon, Benedict, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students. This three story tall dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents. Dobson Hall currently houses new freshmen students.</p>
<p><strong><a>Drake Memorial Library</a></strong></p>
<p>In the beginning the library was a little collection of books housed in a room open only a few hours per week, and was largely used by faculty for reference purposes. It also included a textbook collection and the school's laboratory equipment. As teacher training education became more sophisticated, so did the library.</p>
<p>In the last years of the 1890s, Jeanette Reynolds, who had been a secretary at the school, became the librarian. In 1899 she cataloged the collection according to the then new Dewey Decimal system. Affectionately remembered by alumni as &quot;Jenny Wren,&quot; she laid the foundations of a modern library. The library she presided over was in the central part of the old Normal School building, and included such things as a &quot;pen writing room,&quot; for writing with the fountain pens of that era - only pencils were allowed in the library proper!</p>
<p>In Fall 1939 construction began on the building we know as Hartwell Hall, replacing the old Normal School building. The library in Hartwell was on the second floor, in the center of the building. From the 1940s on the school began to expand, beginning with the winning of teacher's college status in 1942, which called for the expansion of library collections and staff. Hours were extended, and the tradition of library instruction which dated back to the era of &quot;Jenny Wren&quot; continued.</p>
<p>With the postwar expansion of the college, the library became terribly crowded and staff schedules actually had to be planned around the small number of available work areas.</p>
<p>In 1961 the college opened the first building dedicated exclusively as a library, Drake Memorial Library. It was named after two unrelated college staff members, Bernard Drake and Ruth Drake. Bernard Drake was an administrator, Education professor and the dean of students from 1936-1957. He graduated from the Normal School at Fredonia and received his master's degree from Columbia. Drake worked in public schools as Supervising Principal or Superintendent of school in New York communities including Celeran, Silver Creek and Babylon. Prior to his arrival at Brockport, he had been working toward his doctorate at Columbia. Drake initiated a study on the existing structured curriculum of the college in 1948, which resulted in the offering of a greater selection of courses to students.</p>
<p>The name also pays homage to Ruth Drake, who was a member of the faculty for 31 years. Ms. Drake was born in Evanston, Illinois and graduated from Wellesley College in 1926. She entered Brockport as a Kindergarten instructor in 1928, and later earned her master's degree from Columbia in 1946, and a degree in Library Science from Western Reserve University. After several years as the campus Kindergarten Critic, Ms. Drake became the Campus School Librarian until her retirement in 1959.</p>
<p>This new building would serve as the home of the library until 1974, when the library moved to its current location on the south side of campus next to Allen. The old building, now named Rakov, serves as home to many of the school's enrollment and business offices.</p>
<p><strong>Edwards Hall</strong></p>
<p>Edwards Hall was built in 1968 and named after Aletta Edwards and William Edwards, no relation. Aletta Edwards (?-1939) was an English professor and chair of the department from 1908-1934. She graduated from the former State Normal School at Brockport and received her Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Syracuse University. She received her master's degree at the University of Rochester and did advanced work toward her doctorate at the University of Wisconsin, and at Cambridge University, England.</p>
<p>William Edwards (1902&#x2013;1959) was chair of the Social Sciences Department from 1941-1959. He was born in Court House, Ohio and attended both the University of Chicago and Ohio State, where he received his bachelor's and master's of history in the same year.

<p><strong>Gordon Hall</strong></p>
<p>Gordon Hall was built in 1966 and named after Ida and Luther Gordon. The Gordon family was prominent locally and Ida Gordon (1854&#x2013;1946) was one of two women appointed to the Board of Trustees in 1917. Luther Gordon (1822&#x2013;1881) was a successful business person who supported the school at a crucial financial point just after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Luther Gordon was a lumber dealer in the village, and a political force in the Republican Party. Mr. Gordon, along with other town members, refused to pay the Normal School taxes, and he instituted a suit in the Supreme Court against the village for seizing lumber. The court declared the village actions legal, and the tax was paid. Yet afterwards, Mr. Gordon bought half the bonds issued to construct the new Normal building.</p>
<p>Gordon Hall, along with Benedict, Dobson, and Harmon Halls, is a dormitory complex that was designed to accommodate over 600 students. This three story tall dormitory is styled in a suite manner, with two bedrooms connected by a living room, and a bathroom shared by four student residents.

<p><strong>Harrison Hall</strong></p>
<p>Harrison hall was built in 1967 and named after Henry Harrison, a member of the Board of Trustees from 1891&#x2013;1935 and an active and influential supporter of the school.</p>
<p>Henry Harrison was one of the village's most distinguished citizens. He served as President of the Local Board of Managers for 44 years. From 1896-1898, he represented the 45th district in the State Senate and later was Collector of Customs in Rochester. Harrison also served as the chairperson of the Monroe County Draft Board during World War I, and was active in the Red Cross, University Club, and the Chamber of Commerce in Rochester.</p>
<p>Harrison Hall serves as a dining center for the high-rise dorms and suite dorms. This building is located on the western end of the campus and offers traditional meals on the second floor. On the first floor there is a fast food eatery called Trax, a <a>Hershey's Ice Cream</a>, and a small convenience store called Snax.</p>
<p>In October 2007, Harrison re-opened after receiving a multi-million dollar renovation.</p>
<p><strong>Hartwell Hall</strong></p>
<p>Construction on Hartwell Hall was initiated in 1938, and completed in 1941. This building is named after Ernest Hartwell (1884&#x2013;1965). Hartwell Hall, a lovely Georgian Colonial style brick building, stands at the historic heart of the campus. It is the oldest building on campus after the Alumni House. When finished, it made up the entire school, including classrooms, offices, swimming pool, and library. As Hartwell Hall was being erected the old building was torn down in stages. At one point students in the old buildings training school wing reached the new building via a wooden gangplank one story up! During 1938-39, Ora Van Slyke's 4th grade class in the training school organized a &quot;Sidewalk Superintendent's Club&quot; which put together a book documenting the construction in word and picture. The book's depiction of stonemasons laying granite steps, roofers putting down copper sheeting and the like is a vivid reminder that the building really is something of which it can be said, &quot;They don't make them like that anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>Hartwell Hall and the surrounding area were recently restored to provide more modern facilities, but it still retains its aesthetically historical feel. As a folklore note, it is reported that the building is inhabited by several ghosts! Aside from housing ghosts, Hartwell currently provides space for the English, Dance, Philosophy, and Recreation and Leisure departments.</p>
<p><strong>Hazen Health Center</strong></p>
<p>Hazen Health Center was built in 1967 and named after Dr. John Hazen (?-1946), a local physician who served the college for many years up until 1946. This building remains today as the Health Center, and is located in between Holmes and Dailey Halls.</p>
<p><strong>Holmes Hall</strong></p>
<p>Holmes Hall was built in 1967 and named for Daniel and Mary Jane Holmes. Daniel Holmes (1828-?) was on the Board of Trustees from 1854 to 1919, and wrote the Quarter Centennial in celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Brockport State Normal School. His wife Mary Jane was a very popular fiction writer who catered to her female readers by writing wholesome stories dwelling on domestic life in exotic surroundings. These backgrounds were inspired by the extensive world traveling done by Mary Jane and her husband. As Brockport's solitary literary celebrity and because of her own forceful personality, Mrs. Holmes held a very special niche in the heart of the village.</p>
<p>Holmes Hall is home to the Psychology and Communications departments, and was the former hub for the <strong>Brockport Stylus,</strong> the student paper. This three level building holds offices, classrooms, and labs and is an important academic building for Brockport students.</p>

It contained two large lounges, four meeting rooms of various sizes, two listening rooms, two guest rooms, a snack bar, a large dining room seating 250 people, a small dining room designed to seat 50, the offices for student publication, the alumni association office, and an apartment for the manager of the union. By the late sixties, the new Seymour Union facility was built to meet the growing enrollment of the student body. Lathrop has also served as the home to the Dance department, but today is the location of Public Safety.</p>
<p>Lathrop Hall was named after Henry Lathrop, a professor of mathematics at the college from 1912-1935. He came to Brockport as a Mathematics teacher, and eventually rose to the Head of that department, a position he occupied until his retirement in 1935. Mr. Lathrop was also advisor to the yearbook Saga staff, was active in civic affairs, and was a charter member of the Brockport Kiwanis club. Lathrop was fondly referred to as &quot;Daddy Lathrop&quot; by his students, and it is in his memory that Lathrop Hall stands.</p>
<p><strong>Lennon Hall</strong></p>
<p>Lennon Hall was built in 1964 and renovated in 2005. It is the permanent home of the science departments (Biology, Environmental Science, Earth Science) and holds many large classrooms and laboratories.</p>

He became Vice-President of the college upon his arrival in Brockport in 1858. Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1856, he found his true interest to be in education rather than preaching. He became the first president and &quot;Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy.&quot;</p>

MacVicar lead the Brockport Collegiate Institute to victory in the fierce competition to become one of the four new state normal schools. The Normal Schools Act which established four Normal Schools was petitioned to the Legislature by Brockport under the activities of MacVicar. The Institute merged with the Normal School in 1866 because of the financial crisis that was threatening the institution's survival. The borrowing of money to upgrade the school to win state acceptance was a source of some local controversy, and he moved on to the Principalship of Potsdam Normal School and other posts of academia.</p>
<p><strong>McFarlane Hall</strong></p>
<p>McFarlane Hall was built in 1963 and named after Charles McFarlane, the head of the school from 1901-1910.</p>

In 1869, he became principal of the Normal School, a position he held for the next thirty years. In spite of his short stature and slight build, President McLean was an athlete and hero to most of the student athletes at the school. Professor McLean was generous in extending financial aid to students. He was both a rigid disciplinarian and a skillful teacher, especially in Mathematics and Pedagogy. Admired by his faculty and respected by his students, McLean was the dominant figure to the academic life of the school during his tenure as principal.</p>

She was born in England in 1816 and was brought to this country while still a young child. At age 13, she was orphaned by the sudden death of her parents. Miss Mortimer, along with her good friend Clarissa Thurston, served as the first preceptresses of the Female Department.

However, Dr. Rakov is best remembered for his love of teaching. As a professor, Chairman and Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Dr. Rakov made a lasting difference in the lives of thousands of students, providing motivation, inspiration and challenges. In the words of Dr. Rakov, &quot;If I could write my own epitaph, it would simply be...He was useful. He was useful to people, to the college and to the educational system.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Buildings</strong></p>
<p>The <a>Quonset</a> hut science laboratory was built in 1954.</p>
<p>The odd Quonset hut structure pictured above was located near Hartwell Hall, by the railroad tracks where now there is a parking lot. Many stories circulate about the poor heat in the building and, in those days when trains ran much more frequently, the deafening noise every time a train went by!</p>
<p>There was a group of temporary buildings placed on the campus during the 1940s and 1950s, which provided not only space for classes and other uses, but many memories as well for alumni and staff emeriti. They included West Hall, a dorm for women, veterans housing, the Quonset huts and of course the field house (which was the last survivor - it was used for an indoor athletic practice area until 1970, when it was moved from its location to across Redman Road. The Field House has recently been demolished by the town of Brockport.)</p>
