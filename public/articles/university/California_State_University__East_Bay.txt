<p> </p>
<p><strong>California State University, East Bay</strong> (informally referred to as <strong>Cal State East Bay</strong>, <strong>CSU East Bay</strong>, <strong>East Bay</strong>, and <strong>CSUEB</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> located in the <a>eastern region</a> of the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.  The university, as part of the 23-campus <a>California State University</a> system, offers over 100 areas of study.  Cal State East Bay has been designated as a &quot;top&#x2013;tier&quot; institution among master's&#x2013;granting universities in the west by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> and has been recognized as a &quot;Best in the West&quot; college for the past seven years by the <a>Princeton Review</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1957, Cal State East Bay has a student body of over 13,000.  The university's largest and oldest campus is located in the <a>Hayward Hills</a>, with additional campus-sites in the cities of <a>Oakland</a> and <a>Concord</a>.  Cal State East Bay is one of only a handful of universities in the California State University system to operate on the <a>quarter system</a>.</p>
<p>With multiple campuses across the region, the university adopted a new, broader mission to serve the eastern San Francisco Bay Area in 2005.  To reflect the university's more widespread objective, the school changed its name from California State University, Hayward to California State University, East Bay that same year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was established in 1957 as State College for Alameda County, with its primary mission to serve the higher education needs of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.  Its construction was part of the <a>California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> as proposed by <a>Clark Kerr</a> and the original site for the school was <a>Pleasanton, California</a>.  The campus was moved to Hayward before plans were finalized due to the efforts of State Assembly member Carlos Bee and other boosters from the Hayward community.  At the time of its opening in 1959, classes were held on the campus of <a>Hayward High School</a>.  With the addition of the school, higher education in the San Francisco Bay Area became more accessible.  To the south was San Jose State College (now <a>San Jose State University</a>) serving the South Bay counties. To the west was San Francisco State College (now <a>San Francisco State University</a>) serving San Francisco and San Mateo Counties. <a>Chabot College</a>, a part of the <a>California Community College</a> system, opened nearby in Hayward in 1961.</p>
<p>The university has undergone numerous transitions in its history, making name changes accordingly. In 1961, the school was moved to its present location in the Hayward Hills and renamed Alameda County State College.  In 1963, the name was changed to California State College at Hayward. The school was granted university status in 1972, changing its name to California State University, Hayward. In 2005, the university implemented a new, broader mission to serve the eastern San Francisco Bay Area and adopted the name California State University, East Bay.  The proposal to rename the campus to California State University, East Bay  was approved by the California State University Board of Trustees on January 26, 2005.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|275px|CSUEB student housing district, facing east, showing both old and new facilities</a></p>
<p>California State University, East Bay's main campus is located in Hayward, California.  Warren Hall, its signature building on top of the Hayward hills, overlooks the scenic eastern portion of the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>. The building is visible from cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, serving as a landmark for Hayward and the surrounding Eastern San Francisco Bay Area. California State University, East Bay also has a campus in Concord, California in <a>Contra Costa County</a>, and a professional development center in Oakland.  <a>Continuing education</a> programs are available at all three locations.</p>
<p>California State University, East Bay is also known for its Solar Energy Project.  Solar panels were installed on four campus rooftops and are used to generate supplemental power during peak periods and is one of the largest <a>photovoltaic</a> systems in Northern California.  Since its completion in 2004 the university has received recognition on a regional and national level for the project; those include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A $3.4 million rebate from <a>PG &amp; E</a>, the largest rebate issued to date for solar power installation.</li>
  <li>The 2004 Business Environmental Achievement Award from the Hayward City Council.</li>
  <li>The 2004 Green Power Leadership Award at the National Green Power Marketing Conference.</li>
  <li>A 2005 Exceptional Project Award from the Western Council of Construction Consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>On April 8, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a fuel cell project of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) allowing Cal State East Bay&#x2019;s Hayward campus to become one of the first college campuses in Northern California to have a fuel cell. Once installed, the waste heat generated by the fuel cell will be converted into hot water to be used in campus buildings. </p>
<p>Since 2004, the <a>Pioneer Amphitheatre</a> on campus has been home of the <a>KBLX</a> Stone Soul Picnic, a day long festival of <a>R&amp;B</a>, <a>soul</a> and <a>Urban Adult Contemporary</a> music, featured performers have included <a>Ronald Isley</a>, <a>The Whispers</a>, <a>Teena Marie</a>, the late <a>Rick James</a>, and <a>The O'Jays</a>. California State University, East Bay's Associated Student Incorporated also hosts concerts with artists like Lupe Fiasco and Guapele.</p>
<p>In 2005, Cal State East Bay launched an aggressive construction project with the building of three new facilities: the Wayne and Gladys Valley Business and Technology Center (VBT), the Pioneer Heights student housing expansion and the University Union annex. The  VBT center was dedicated on February 28, 2007, making it the first new academic building on the Hayward Campus in more than 30 years. The building offers a state-of-the-art home for programs in business, technology management, engineering, multimedia, science, and online degree programs.   An expansion to Pioneer Heights was dedicated in fall 2008. Student housing was able to accommodate more than 450 new residents and offer a  dining commons. An annex to the existing University  Union opened in January 2007.  </p>
<p>Construction continues with the anticipated dedication of the new Student Services and Administration building in summer 2010 and the Recreation and Wellness Center in Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Beginning in June 2010, Pioneer Stadium is the new home to the <a>FC Gold Pride</a> women's professional soccer team. <a>FC Gold Pride 2010 schedule</a></p>
<p>Construction workers removed the stadium&#x2019;s grass and replaced it with artificial turf, while widening the field to regulation size, said Jim Zavagno, director of planning design and construction for Cal State East Bay.</p>
<p>As part of the facility&#x2019;s overall renovation, which began in January, the width of the existing running track circling the playing field was narrowed to five lanes to accommodate the larger field. &#x201c;In addition to the competition areas, improved sidewalks and fencing were added to the facility,&#x201d; said Zavagno, who reported that the construction costs came in under budget at $1.9 million, about $600,000 less than had originally been projected. &quot;Renovations to Pioneer Stadium included new markings and a recently installed artificial turf field that's been widened to meet professional soccer regulations.&quot;</p>
<p>Beginning in September, a parking structure is to be built that will add 1,100 additional parking spaces. The project with a cost of $24.5 million, will be paid by the parking fees. A bridge from the parking structure will allow students and faculty access to the central campus and other buildings such as the Recreation and Wellness center, Warren Hall, and Meiklejohn Hall.</p>

The Biotechnology Program developed at California State University, East Bay affords the university a status as the center of research and development in the <a>Life sciences</a>, <a>Bioinformatics</a> and <a>technologies</a> for the <a>Eastern San Francisco Bay Area</a>.</p>

The report, &#x201c;Working for California: The Impact of the California State University System,&#x201d; also underscores the long-lasting value of a Cal State East Bay education, concluding that approximately $1.6 billion of earnings by alumni in the East Bay area is directly attributable to their college degrees and creates an additional $2.5 billion of industry activity throughout the state.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The university's Department of Communications publishes a weekly newspaper called <em>The Pioneer</em>, its name referring to the school <a>mascot</a>, Pioneer Pete.  The paper is staffed by faculty and students. East Bay is a diverse state university as indicated by the annual headcount report. </p>

<h3>Associated Students Incorporated</h3>
<p>Associated Students Incorporated (ASI) is a student-run and student-owned organization that represents the student body at California State University, East Bay. Elected by the California State University, East Bay student body, the 15-member ASI Board of Directors is the governing body of Associated Students, Inc. The Board makes policy and oversees the fiscal responsibility of ASI. Additionally, the Board assists the University in planning, implementing, and evaluating campus programs, events, and curriculum. ASI currently has four departments: ASI Presents, ASI Business Office, Student Government, and the Early Childhood Education Center. In 2007 the University administration did not allow ASI to hold a student referendum on increasing student fees to fund a recreation and wellness center. It substituted 'alternative consultation'. In 2008, the administration again did not allow ASI to hold a referendum on increasing student fees to fund athletic scholarship for a move to Division II sports. Again, it substituted 'alternative consultation'.</p>
<h3>Mascot</h3>
<p>The mascot of the university is the Pioneer.  At the inception of the athletic program in 1961 the student body chose a spacesuit clad Space Pioneer as the mascot.  In the years since the mascot was shortened to the Pioneers and took a more terrestrial image; first as a frontiersman with a coonskin cap and then as a forty-niner who is reminiscent of <a>Yosemite Sam</a>.  In the 1980s the student body voted to change the mascot to the Vampires, but the decision was overturned by then-president Ellis McCune. In 2005 there was talk of changing the mascot along with the university's name change.  The original plan was to unveil the new mascot by the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.  However, there was little student support for a mascot change; a majority of the students and faculty were in favor of keeping the Pioneer as the school mascot while supporting a redesign of the Pioneer image.  A final decision on whether or not to keep the Pioneer as the mascot of the university was to be reached before the 2006-2007 academic year but is still an open question in 2010.  A new athletics logo was unveiled on November 20, 2009 at a home opener basketball game.</p>
