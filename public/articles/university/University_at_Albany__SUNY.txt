<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University at Albany, State University of New York</strong>, also informally called <strong>SUNY Albany</strong> or <strong>UAlbany</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Albany</a>, <a>Guilderland</a>, and <a>East Greenbush</a>, <a>New York</a>, <a>United States</a>; is the senior campus and a <a>flagship campus</a> of the <a>State University of New York</a> (SUNY) system. Founded in 1844, it is an internationally recognized public research institution, which carries out a broad mission of undergraduate and graduate education, research, and service. The University has three campuses: the Uptown Campus in Albany and Guilderland's <a>McKownville</a> neighborhood, the Downtown Campus in Albany, and one campus in <a>East Greenbush</a>, just east of Albany.</p>
<p>The University enrolls more than 18,000 students in nine schools and colleges, which offer 58 undergraduate majors and 128 graduate degree programs. The University&#x2019;s academic choices are diverse and include a range of new and emerging fields such as <a>public policy</a>, <a>nanotechnology</a>, <a>globalization</a>, <a>documentary</a> studies, <a>biotechnology</a> and <a>informatics</a>. Students take advantage of more than 300 study-abroad programs, as well as extensive internship opportunities that offer real-world experience in New York&#x2019;s capital and surrounding region. The Honors College, which opened in fall 2006, offers opportunities for the best-prepared students to work closely with faculty.</p>
<p>University at Albany, State University of New York faculty attracted $342.3 million in research funding in 2008-2009 for work advancing discovery in a wide range of fields. The research enterprise is distinguished by established and emerging strengths in four areas: nanoscale sciences and <a>engineering</a>, <a>social science</a> and public policy, <a>life sciences</a> and <a>atmospheric sciences</a>. A wide range of explorations in other areas also contributes to the rich spectrum of UAlbany research.</p>
<p>In addition to offering many cultural benefits, including a nationally-recognized contemporary <a>art</a> <a>museum</a> and a world-renowned writers institute, UAlbany plays a major role in the <a>economic development</a> of the <a>Capital Region</a> and New York State &#x2014; particularly through its programs in nanosciences and nanotechnology and in the biotechnology and biomedical sciences. An economic impact study in 2004 estimated UAlbany&#x2019;s economic impact to be $1.1 billion annually in New York State &#x2014; $1 billion of that in the Capital Region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|300px|View of the New York State Normal College on Western Avenue in 1909</a> Although the university is the oldest SUNY component, it was an independent teachers' college for most of its history until SUNY was formed in 1948. The University at Albany began as the <strong>New York State Normal School</strong> on May 7, 1844, by vote of the State Legislature. Beginning with 29 students and four faculty in an abandoned railroad depot on State Street in the heart of the city, the Normal School was the first New York State-chartered institution of higher education.</p>
<p>Dedicated to training New York students as schoolteachers and administrators, by the early 1890s the &#x201c;School&#x201d; had become the New York State Normal College and, with a revised four-year curriculum in 1905, became the first public institution of higher education in New York to be granted the power to confer the bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>A new campus &#x2014; today, UAlbany&#x2019;s Downtown Campus &#x2014; was established in 1909 on a site of  between Washington and Western avenues. By 1913, the institution was home to 590 students and 44 faculty members, it offered a master&#x2019;s degree for the first time, and bore a new name &#x2014; the New York State College for Teachers. Enrollments grew to a peak of 1,424 in 1932.</p>
<p>In 1948 the <a>State University of New York</a> system was created, comprising the College for Teachers and several other institutions throughout the state. SUNY, including its University at Albany, ultimately became a manifestation of the grand vision of Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, who wanted a public university system to accommodate the college students of the post-World War II baby boom. To do so, he launched a massive construction program that developed over 50 new campuses.</p>
<p>In 1957 the University at Albany, State University of New York was officially designated a doctoral-degree granting university center of SUNY. The same year, Rockefeller broke ground for the current Uptown Campus on the former site of the Albany Country Club. The new campus's first dormitory opened in October 1958, and the first classes on the academic podium in the Fall of 1962. By 1970, a year beyond the University&#x2019;s 125th anniversary, enrollment had grown to 13,200 and the faculty to 746. The Uptown Campus, designed by architect <a>Edward Durell Stone</a>, accommodated this growth and gave visible evidence of the schools transition from a teachers college to a broad <a>liberal arts</a> university. The Downtown Campus became dedicated to the fields of public policy: criminal justice, public affairs, information science and social welfare. In 1985, the University added the School of Public Health, a unique joint endeavor with the state&#x2019;s <a>Department of Health</a>.</p>
<p>In 1983, the <a>New York State Writers Institute</a> was founded by <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning author <a>William Kennedy</a>. As of 2007, the Institute had hosted over time more than 850 writers, poets, journalists, historians, dramatists and filmmakers. The list includes eight Nobel Prize winners, nearly 200 Pulitzer Prize and <a>National Book Award</a> winners, several Motion Picture <a>Academy Award</a> winners and nominees, and numerous other literary prize recipients. In addition the Institute has hosted many up-and-coming writers to provide them with exposure at the beginning of their writing careers.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, the university built a $3 billion,  Albany NanoTech complex, extending the Uptown Campus westward. By 2006, it became home to the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering. In 1996, a third campus &#x2014; the East Campus &#x2014; was added  east of the Uptown Campus in <a>Rensselaer County</a>, when the University acquired former Sterling-Winthrop laboratories and converted them into labs, classrooms, and a business incubator concentrating on advances in biotechnology and other health-related disciplines. In 2005, the East Campus became home to the University&#x2019;s Gen*NY*Sis Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics. Growth occurred on the Uptown Campus in the fall of 2004, when a new Life Sciences Building opened, dedicated to basic research and education. In the spring of 2005, the university created the first-of-its-kind College of Computing and Information, with a stated goal of preparing students for the information technology-centric world of the 21st Century.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Uptown Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Uptown Campus from Collins Circle</a> The Uptown Campus, the University&#x2019;s main campus, is located at 1400 Washington Avenue in Albany. Its effect has been described as &quot;Dazzling one-of-a-kind&quot; by architectural critic Thomas A. Gaines in his <em>The Campus as a Work of Art</em> (Praeger, New York, 1991). He called it &quot;a formal masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a study in classical romanticism.&quot; Construction lasted from 1956&#x2013;1958 and designed in 1954-1956 by renowned American architect <a>Edward Durell Stone</a> (1902&#x2013;1978), the campus bears Stone&#x2019;s signature style of bold unified design, expressed by its towers, domes, fountains, soaring colonnades and sweeping canopy. The result is dramatically different from traditional university campuses with dispersed buildings and disparate architectural styles. The campus exemplifies the signature style Stone used in his major projects between 1953 and 1970, including the U.S. Embassy in <a>New Delhi</a>, India; the Hotel Phoenicia in <a>Beirut</a>, <a>Lebanon</a>; the <a>John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>; <a>2 Columbus Circle</a> in Manhattan, New York; and the <a>Aon Center</a>, originally the Standard Oil Building, in Chicago.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Fountain</a> Governor <a>Nelson A. Rockefeller</a> envisioned a public university system to accommodate the college students of the post-World War II &#x201c;<a>Baby Boom</a>&#x2019;&#x2019;, and as a connoisseur and patron of modern art and architecture, he encouraged many of the era&#x2019;s leading modernist architects to design the campuses. Inspired by this vision and the need for a new campus accommodating 7,500 students, Stone viewed the Albany project as a powerful statement concerning the integrated nature of campus life, with facilities for learning and living all part of a unified complex comprising activities and academic. Stone&#x2019;s campus composition emphasizes residential quadrangles, or &#x201c;quads&#x201d; &#x2014; surrounding academic buildings.  At the hub of the campus is the rectangular &#x201c;Academic Podium&#x201d; featuring 13 three-story buildings under a single overhanging canopy roof. The Podium&#x2019;s showpiece is a central pool with fountains and an off-center circular bell tower, or &#x201c;Carillon,&#x201d; which also serves as a water storage reservoir. The domed Main Library, the Performing Arts Center, and Campus Center surround the pool, reflecting facets of campus life. A grand entrance welcomes visitors by way of a &#x201c;great lawn&#x201d; (Collins Circle) and an entry plaza. The four residential quadrangles are located adjacent to the four corners of the academic podium.  Each quads consists of a 23-story high-rise dormitory,  surrounded by a square of low-rise buildings.</p>
<p>On the west end of the Uptown Campus is the Albany Nanotech complex, begun in the late 1990s, still expanding, and home to the College of Nanoscale Sciences and Engineering, the bulk of the university&#x2019;s metrology and characterization tools, the <a>National Weather Service</a> (NWS), and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC).</p>
<p>In addition to the Main Library, the Uptown Campus is home to the newest of the three libraries comprising UAlbany's University Libraries: the Science Library, opened in September 1999.</p>
<h3>Downtown Campus</h3>
<p>The Downtown Campus, located at 135 Western Ave., just one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the <a>New York State Capitol</a> building and <a>Empire State Plaza</a>, is the site of the original New York State College for Teachers. Construction began in 1909 on the first three buildings: Draper, Husted and Hawley halls, after the previous location on Willett Street burned down. Later additions to the campus were Richardson Hall, Page Hall and The Milne School (all in 1929), along with additions to Draper and Richardson halls (both in the 1960s).</p>
<p>The Downtown Campus is home to the University's Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, School of Criminal Justice, College of Computing and Information, and School of Social Welfare. It also houses one of the University's three libraries, the <a>Thomas E. Dewey</a> Graduate Library, located in Hawley Hall.</p>
<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>The University&#x2019;s  East Campus, located in <a>East Greenbush</a>, is home to UAlbany&#x2019;s School of Public Health and the Cancer Research Center (CRC) which opened in 2005. Located also on the campus &#x2014; which contains  of lab, support and associated office space &#x2014; is the Center for Functional Genomics, which facilitates research in the areas of <a>microarrays</a>, <a>proteomics</a>, <a>molecular biology</a> and <a>transgenics</a>, and some 15 private <a>biotechnology</a> companies &#x2014; both established and those which are part of the University&#x2019;s business incubator program. Biopharmaceutical giant <a>Regeneron</a> has a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility adjacent to the campus where it produces the investigational products for all its clinical trials.</p>
<p>UAlbany and Albany Medical Center in July 2008 entered into a memorandum of understanding, to create the  Institute for Biomedical Education and Research at UAlbany&#x2019;s East Campus. The Institute will focus research efforts on cancer, cardiology and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease.</p>
<p>In March 2009 it was announced that <a>Tech Valley High School</a>, a local <a>high-tech</a>, <a>public</a> <a>consortium</a> <a>high school</a>, would be renting  at an annual cost of $450,000 per year, starting in time for the 2009&#x2014;2010 <a>school year</a>.</p>
<h3>Uptown Campus Housing</h3>
<p><a>thumb|State Quad, one of four main dormitories on the uptown campus</a> The Uptown Campus is home to six of the University's seven residential complexes. Four of these &#x2014; Indian Quad, Dutch Quad, Colonial Quad, and State Quad &#x2014; sit at the Academic Podium's corners; each consists of eight three-story, low-rise buildings encircling a 22-story tower with a total capacity of 1,200 students each. The four quads serve as a chronological timeline of New York State history, beginning with Indian Quad, moving clockwise to Dutch, then Colonial, and finally, State. The other two, Freedom Apartments and Empire Commons, are reserved for juniors and seniors. These are &quot;apartment-style&quot; residences and include kitchens, furnished living rooms, and, on Empire Commons, washers, dryers, dishwashers, single bedrooms, and central air conditioning.</p>
<p>The Uptown Campus also contains special housing for students in the honors college.  This housing, offered to incoming freshmen and returning sophomores, is found on State Quad in the Melville and Steinmetz halls.  These recently renovated halls provide moderately better rooms with improved lighting and greater floor space. Renovations are currently being done on halls on Indian, State and Alumni Quads.</p>
<h3>Downtown Housing</h3>
<p>Alumni Quad, one of the University's seven residential complexes, is a short distance away from the Downtown Campus. Its name commemorates the Alumni Association, which purchased most of the land on which the complex stands and funded the construction of the first two residence halls, Pierce and Sayles, which opened in 1935 and 1941. (Brubacher, Alden and Waterbury halls, which completed the quadrangle&#x2019;s edifices, opened in 1951, 1958, and 1959, respectively.) Students living on Alumni are typically sophomores, transfer students and international students. The murder of Richard J. Bailey in October 2008 has made students take extra precautions, around the quad and the entire Pine Hills community which is rich with UAlbany students.</p>
<h2>Event Facilities</h2>
<h3>Campus Center</h3>
<p>The Campus Center, located on the Uptown Campus Podium, is the community center of the University at Albany, State University of New York, serving students, faculty, professional staff, alumni, and guests. Traditionally considered the &quot;hearthstone&quot; or &quot;living room&quot; of the campus, the Campus Center provides services and conveniences that include lounging areas, several cafeterias, a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore, and many national chain eateries operated and staffed by Chartwells. The multi-faceted structure is the site for numerous informal and formal interactions, the latter including the meetings of many student-run clubs, academic conferences, and cultural functions.</p>
<p>The Center&#x2019;s Facilities &amp; Operations staff coordinates and manages eight meeting rooms in all, as well as a ballroom. Together they comprise the conference portion of this multi-faceted facility. During the academic year, the Center&#x2019;s meeting rooms host over 9,000 persons per month. The lobby and exterior areas of the building, the latter which commands a small fountain, are notable for the tabling done by individuals and groups; their purposes include ticket sales, craft items, other vending sponsored by campus organizations, political activism, charitable fundraising, and general campus information.</p>
<p>The Campus Center is currently undergoing a huge multi-year $750 million dollar rennovation and expansion project.</p>
<h3>Performing Arts Center</h3>

<h3>SEFCU Arena</h3>
<p>In the spring of 1992, the University opened <a>SEFCU Arena</a>, an $11 million field house for UAlbany&#x2019;s men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s basketball and track teams. It has an .11 mile indoor track. The 5,000-seat arena also serves as a major venue for community events such as rock and pop concerts, sporting events and University activities.</p>
<p>In addition, SEFCU Arena contains a fitness center with Nautilus and Universal machines, rowing ergometers and exercise bikes; four racquetball/handball courts and four squash courts; athletic training and rehabilitation facilities with three whirlpool baths, a musculoskeletal evaluation device and other therapeutic machines.  SEFCU Arena also houses numerous team and general use locker rooms, as well as an indoor practice facility for the women's golf team.</p>
<p>SEFCU Arena and Physical Education Building were recently air-conditioned, as the state appropriated funds for renovations and permanent improvements to the University's facilities. The $2.3 million in funding was prompted by the New York Giants decision to hold their football training camp at the University in March 1996.</p>
<h3>Physical Education Building</h3>
<p>Adjacent to the SEFCU Arena is the Physical Education Building which houses University Gymnasium; three full-size playing surfaces which can be used for basketball, volleyball, and tennis; four racquetball/handball courts; four squash courts; a swimming pool; a fitness and weight training center with Olympic weights; an aerobic exercise room, and a dance studio. University Gymnasium is home to the UAlbany Women's Volleyball team, and also serves as a practice facility for baseball, softball, field hockey and lacrosse. University Gymasium is also the school's primary indoor student recreational facility, playing host to intramural sport leagues including basketball and street hockey.</p>
<p>The PE Building's lower level also houses the University's swimming pool.  The seven-lane pool is open to University students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members who purchase facility passes.  The lanes are divided to allow  swimmers of all abilities to share the pool at the same time. On the second floor of the PE Building is the UAlbany Strength &amp; Conditioning complex, where varsity student-athletes focus on the proper development and combination of strength, power, speed, agility, mobility, conditioning and body composition to enhance performance in all athletic arenas.</p>
<p>UAlbany's strength and conditioning area is housed in a spacious  varsity strength complex. The weight room is  and is a fully-equipped, Olympic-style free weight room. An efficient design allows for large teams, or several teams, to workout at a single time. The skills room is another  adjacent to the weight room that offers a full line of equipment to enhance agility and quickness. It is equipped with plyometric boxes, jump ropes, medicine balls, bikes, cones and various speed building devices. The strength complex is for varsity athletic team use only and is supervised by two full-time coaches and three student interns.</p>
<h3>The Bubble</h3>
<p>&quot;The Bubble&quot; is an air-supported structure that is used for tennis, basketball, and volleyball.  It also serves as a secondary practice facility for football, baseball, softball, lacrosse, track &amp; field, and strength &amp; conditioning. It was fitted with a brand-new covering with minor interior renovations in the spring of 2003. It is located to the east of the Physical Education Building.</p>
<h3>John Fallon Field</h3>
<p>John Fallon Field, the home for UAlbany men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lacrosse, was completed in the fall of 2005.  Fallon, a former UAlbany student-athlete, and a partner at Leboeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae, LLP in New York City, made a significant contribution to fund the construction of the all-weather turf field, a Sportexe Momentum Turf 41 surface. The first phase of the project was coordinated by UAlbany&#x2019;s Office of Architecture, Engineering and Construction Management.  The plan was designed by Clough Harbor and Associates LLP.  John Fallon Field is adjacent to Alumni Turf Field, which serves as the home for the school&#x2019;s field hockey team and as a multi-use recreational field for UAlbany students.  Both all-weather fields are located just south of Indian Quad on campus.</p>
<h3>University Field</h3>
<p>University Field seats capacity crowds of 5,000 for football games, and has an all-weather, 400-meter track surrounding a natural grass surface.  University Field is home to the UAlbany football and men's and women's track &amp; field teams.  The lighted field can accommodate both day and night events.  In 2004, the men's lacrosse program played its first-ever evening contest at the facility.</p>
<p>On the roof of the adjacent Physical Education building there is a media facility, home and opponent video locations, and a viewing box for use by the University President and other dignitaries.  Inside the PE Building are home, away and officials' locker room facilities.  Directly adjacent to the field, the UAlbany football locker room was renovated in the spring of 2003.  The project, funded through alumni donations, doubled the size of the Great Danes' previous facilities.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The university is a first-tier component of the <a>State University of New York</a>.  It receives annual appropriations as a part of the SUNY budget, and the New York <a>State University Construction Fund</a> manages and finances buildings and capital improvements.  Although the university is governed by the SUNY Board of Trustees, the university does have a separate 10-member council that is appointed by the Governor, with one student-elected member.  The Governor designates the council's chair.  The University has its own President, who is currently George M. Philip.</p>
<p>The university has a separate University at Albany Foundation, which conducts fundraising on behalf of the university.  For example, when the new library was built, state funds paid for the construction of the building, but the Foundation raised $3.5 million to equip the new facility.  The Foundation has a separate Board of Directors, which includes three voting member elected by the faculty and one elected by students.  The Foundation owns a number of facilities that supplement the state-owned buildings, including: the Management Services Center, the President's residence, the East Campus, the State Street Conference Center, the Cancer Research Center. During 2008-09, the Foundation raised $4.5 million and had total assets (including buildings) of $100,431,527.</p>

A major focus of study is the social and personal forces that lead to criminal conduct and the analysis of the organization and operation of crime control systems. Particular emphasis is placed on the interactions among the many agencies which comprise criminal justice systems and on the relationships between these systems and other facets of society.</p>
<p>The School&#x2019;s graduates have been highly successful in both academic and practical fields, including leadership in criminal justice research and teaching, all the operating agencies of criminal justice, and the many private and non-profit organizations which provide services or make policy recommendations.</p>
<h3>School of Education</h3>
<p>The legacy of the University at Albany, State University of New York began with devotion to the enhancement of education quality and practice. Founded as the New York Normal School of Teachers in 1844, the institution was the state's first public institution of higher learning, thriving as the Normal School until it expanded to become the New York State College for Teachers in 1914, and then, in 1962, the State University of New York at Albany.</p>
<p>The School of Education became a reality that year as part of a multi-disciplinary university center. It remained the home of the original teacher training programs and faculty, including, from 1845 until its closing in 1977, the <a>Milne School</a>, the University's campus laboratory school where prospective teachers carried out their practice teaching.</p>
<p>Since 1962, the School has also grown in size and scope, fulfilling its mission to foster enhanced learning and human development. It is home to 1,500 graduate students in more than 30 different master&#x2019;s, certificate and doctoral degree programs housed within four departments: Educational Administration and Policy Studies, Educational and Counseling Psychology, Educational Theory and Practice, and Reading. Now offering only graduate-level degree programs, the School nonetheless provides a broad range of opportunities for undergraduates to explore the field of education.</p>
<p>The School is home to 15 different centers and institutes which aid Capital Region schools and research a broad range of the critical educational issues of our time. These include the School&#x2019;s outreach arm, the Capital Area School Development Association, which provides services to 120 school districts; the Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities, which is funded by a three-year $1.24 million grant from the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>; the Center for Urban Youth and Technology; and the National Research Center on English Learning &amp; Achievement, which since 1987 has been funded by the <a>U.S. Department of Education</a> to conduct research dedicated to improving students&#x2019; English and <a>literacy</a> achievement.</p>
<h3>School of Public Health</h3>

The cabins and campsites at Dippikill are open to reservations from the University&#x2019;s undergraduates, graduate students, alumni, faculty and staff.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p></p>
<p>University at Albany, State University of New York <a>intercollegiate athletics</a> date back to the late 1890s, but its development was hampered for several decades by inadequate facilities, uncertain financial support, and the relatively small number of male students in an institution designed to develop elementary school teachers. Tennis remained a constant from 1898 on and men&#x2019;s <a>basketball</a> dates back to 1909, but attempts to field teams in football (1922), <a>baseball</a> (1896&#x2013;1901), swimming and <a>hockey</a> were aborted. Expansion into men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s sports increased after <a>World War II</a>, and then expanded greatly in the 1960s (men&#x2019;s sports of <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>track &amp; field</a>, <a>cross-country</a> and <a>swimming</a> moved from club to varsity status, and women&#x2019;s <a>tennis</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, basketball and swimming were introduced), a direct result of the introduction of the new Uptown Campus (see item above) and its expanded athletic facilities. A nickname change also occurred, the Pedagogues becoming the Great Danes &#x2014; making UAlbany the only American college or university with that mascot. The school's colors are purple and gold.</p>
<p>After the 1972 <a>NCAA</a> restructuring, UAlbany competed in <a>Division III</a> athletics until the 1995-96 school year, when it moved to the <a>Division II</a> level as part of a transition to <a>Division I</a> competition. That process was completed in the fall of 1999; UAlbany now has 19 varsity sports (8 men, 11 women) competing at the Division I level. All athletic programs are run by the University&#x2019;s Department of Athletics and Recreation.</p>
<p>Other than the sport of football, the school&#x2019;s teams have been members of the <a>America East Conference</a> since 2001. Football participates in the Football Championship Subdivision level (formerly Division I-AA) as an associate member of the <a>Northeast Conference</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to varsity sports, UAlbany competes in many sports at the club level such as swimming, men's hockey, <a>rugby</a>, crew [<a>http://www.albanycrew.coam/</a>] and <a>ultimate frisbee</a>. However, these teams are not affiliated with the Department of Athletics and Recreation and are funded by the Student Association.</p>
<h3>The Earth Tones</h3>
<p>The <strong>Earth Tones</strong> is an all-male <a>a cappella</a> singing group.  Founded in 1998, the Earth Tones is known for its work both on campus as well as within the community, including performances at local high schools and outreach work at facilities like the <a>Albany Medical Center</a>. The group stages two semester shows in the Recital Hall in the PAC (Performing Arts Center) at the university.  In addition to these shows, the Earth Tones also perform at local venues and have even sung for the inaugural proceedings for former <a>New York Governor</a> <a>Eliot Spitzer</a>.  In recent years, the group has attended the Northeast branch of the ICCA (<a>International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella</a>) competition, placing second for two consecutive years and advancing from Quarter Finals to Semi-Finals.  The group's repertoire consists of many diverse styles and genres of music, including pop, rock, hip-hop, R&amp;B, soul/funk, reggae and punk.</p>
<h3>UAlbany Traditions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fountain Day is UAlbany&#x2019;s annual rite of spring when the main fountain on the Academic Podium is turned on for the season. This event draws a huge cross-section of the University Community, gathering students, faculty, and staff for an afternoon of festivities. Fountain Day began in 1978 as Human Awareness Potential day. The University President usually presides over the ceremony and countdown to the turning on of the fountains. In recent years, Fountain Day has been shaped into a carnival-esque atmosphere complete with beach balls, rubber ducks, free caricatures, free massages, fried dough vendors, music, contests, and giveaways.</li>
  <li>The Big Purple Growl is the annual winter homecoming celebration. The Ferocious Feast kicks off the festivities with lots of great food and fun. The Growl usually features a doubleheader with both the women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s basketball teams playing home at the SEFCU Arena. Beginning in 1997, this annual event is regarded as an exciting and spirited day for all members of the University community.</li>
  <li>On the University seal is Minerva, the Roman goddess of crafts and wisdom. But because <a>Minerva</a> was also identified with the Greek goddess <a>Athena</a>, she was known as the goddess of war and victory as well. This famous statue was purchased in 1888 and rescued by Charles Wurtham (a custodian) from a devastating fire in the Normal College&#x2019;s administrative offices. This seven-foot, white plaster landmark of the University at Albany, State University of New York is on display in the <a>Science Library</a> foyer on the Uptown Campus. While there is no official record of where the statue of Minerva came from, it is reported that it was purchased with funds from a $1 student fee collected for make-up exams.</li>
