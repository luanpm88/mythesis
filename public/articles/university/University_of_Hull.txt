<p> The <strong>University of Hull</strong>, also known as <strong>Hull University</strong>, is an <a>English</a> <a>university</a>, founded in 1927, located in <a>Hull</a>, a city in the <a>East Riding of Yorkshire</a>. Though classed as a provincial or &quot;<a>redbrick university</a>&quot;, its expansion in recent decades has seen the addition of a variety of building styles from the traditional main buildings, 1960s teaching blocks to modern 'state-of-the-art' additions. The main campus is located in a residential district of North Hull on <a>Cottingham</a> Road.  The University has a smaller campus in <a>Scarborough</a> on the <a>North Yorkshire</a> coast. It is a partner in the proposed University Centre of <a>Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education</a> in North East Lincolnshire. The main campus is home to the <a>Hull York Medical School</a>, a joint initiative with the <a>University of York</a>.</p>
<p>The University's <a>Brynmor Jones Library</a> was the workplace of the <a>poet</a> <a>Philip Larkin</a> who served as its Head Librarian for thirty years.  The <a>Philip Larkin Society</a> organises activities in remembrance of Larkin including the <a>Larkin 25</a> festival which was organised during 2010 in partnership with the University.  The Library was also the workplace of former <a>poet laureate</a> <a>Andrew Motion</a> and the late film director <a>Anthony Minghella</a>. <a>Lord Wilberforce</a> was chancellor of the University from 1978 until 1994. <a>Robert Armstrong</a> was chancellor from 1994 to 2006. <a>Virginia Bottomley</a> was installed as the current chancellor in April 2006. </p>
<p><a>Alumni of the University of Hull</a> are prominent in the fields of academia, politics, journalism and drama. They include former MP and Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott of Kingston-upon-Hull (<a>John Prescott</a>), social scientist Lord <a>Anthony Giddens</a>, poet <a>Roger McGough</a>, author <a>John McCarthy (journalist)</a>, politician and author <a>Chris Mullin</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Venn Building</a> The foundation stone of <strong>University College Hull</strong>, then an external college of the <a>University of London</a>, was laid in 1927 by the <a>Duke of York</a> (who later became <a>George VI</a>). It was built on land donated by <a>Hull City Council</a> and local benefactors <a>Thomas Ferens</a> and <a>G F Grant</a>. A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students. The college at that time consisted of one building, the Venn building (named after the mathematician <a>John Venn</a>, who was born in Hull). The building is the administration centre of the university</p>
<p>The original university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928. The symbols are the torch for learning, the rose for Yorkshire, the ducal coronet from the arms of the City of Hull, the fleur-de-lys for Lincolnshire and the dove, symbolising peace, from the arms of Thomas Ferens. These symbols have later been reused to create the modern university logo.</p>
<h3>Royal Charter</h3>
<p>The college gained its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1954, which empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the third university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England. The Brynmor Jones Library was constructed in 1960, with a tower block extension added in 1970. During the 1960s more academic buildings were added, with their height diminishing from the centre of the campus towards the perimeter, a barrier which the university was quickly outgrowing.</p>
<h3>Liquid crystal technology</h3>
<p>In 1972 <a>George Gray</a> and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable <a>liquid crystal</a>s in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products. This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the <a>Queen's Award for Technological Achievement</a> for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made <a>liquid crystal display</a>s possible.

<h3>New campuses</h3>
<p>In 2000 the university bought the site of <a>University College Scarborough</a> on Filey Road, Scarborough to become the <a>University of Hull Scarborough Campus</a>. The university then further expanded in 2003, when it purchased the buildings of the adjacent <a>University of Lincoln</a> campus which, from the 2005 academic year, became the west campus of the university. The site now houses the <a>Hull York Medical School</a> and the recently relocated business school, which is housed in three buildings - Wharfe, Derwent and Esk.</p>
<h3>Department closure</h3>
<p>Coming soon after a large expansion of the university by breadth of courses and physical size with the HYMS campus, in 2005, the university decided to close its maths department. This was due to a 'reduction in funding' and general shortage in UK maths undergraduates. Four other UK university maths departments had closed since 1999. The department taught around 175 students, and the department's staff moved to the University of York. The Centre for Mathematics replaced the department. This offers mathematics 'support' instead to physics, chemistry and biology students.</p>
