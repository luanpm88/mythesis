<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>The idea for starting a <a>Bible</a> institute in the Northwest started in <a>1928</a> at an annual meeting of the Northwest District Council of the <a>Assemblies of God</a>. J.S. Secrist, a council member had presented the idea, but it wasn&#x2019;t until the annual meeting in <a>1933</a> that his idea was adopted by council members from all of the states in the District.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small church in <a>Seattle</a> called the Hollywood Temple had invited a young man from <a>Fargo, North Dakota</a> to be the pastor of the small ministry. <a>Henry H. Ness</a> accepted the invitation and moved his family to <a>Seattle</a> the same year. After only a few months, Ness had the impression from <a>God</a> that he should start a <a>Bible</a> school. Ness had started the <a>North Central Bible Institute</a>, now <a>North Central University</a>, four years before moving to <a>Seattle</a>. He approached the Northwest District of the Assemblies of God about starting the institute and offered the Hollywood Temple as the campus. Later that year, Ness became the first president of Northwest Bible Institute and a man named C.C. Beatty became the first Dean and instructor. <a>Charles E. Butterfield</a>, and <a>T.S. Sandall</a>, both pastors from the <a>Puget Sound</a> area also taught a couple times a week. Other staff and faculty included <a>Ruth Morris</a>, an English teacher, Delbert Cox, who taught music, and Mrs. Christiansen, who volunteered as the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>In <a>1949</a>, Ness resigned his position almost overnight due to the political stress that he was facing in the <a>Seattle</a> area. After 5 months of searching for a new president, Charles Butterfield was appointed to the position. Along with the change in leadership came a change in the name of the Northwest Bible Institute to Northwest Bible College. In order to acquire accreditation, Butterfield required the faculty to have degrees or work to obtain them. He also made changes in the structure of the academics and administration so that the new college ran more like an educational institution focused on preparing people for a wide variety of ministries and vocations.  By <a>1952</a>, the <a>Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges</a> gave full accreditation to Northwest Bible College, and the <a>United States Department of Education</a> recognized them as a school of higher learning. <a>400px|thumb|The Donald H. Argue Health and Sciences Center</a></p>
<p>The early <a>'50s</a> also came with some conflict with Hollywood Temple which had changed its name to <a>Calvary Temple</a>. Except for a few years around the time that Ness had resigned, the college had been expanding as had the church. Even with the acquisition of other buildings for dorms and the building of a new sanctuary for the church, the space was very limited. They started a campus fund in <a>1952</a> with $112.41. In <a>1955</a>, the city of <a>Seattle</a> proposed the new <a>I-5</a> freeway that would cut through the middle of campus. Butterfield knew that they needed a new place to go. Through many travels and visitations, he came to an old military shipbuilding ship building facility and housing project on the east side of <a>Lake Washington</a>. As he prayed, he felt that God was promising this location as the future campus of Northwest Bible College. He pursued the purchase of the land and structures, but was rejected. Finally in <a>1958</a>, the <a>Department of Health, Education and Welfare</a> awarded Northwest Bible College twenty-two and one-thirds acres at no cost. The college purchased an additional  for 30,000 dollars. That summer, construction began and finished with 4 buildings designed by Butterfield&#x2019;s son, Robert. H.J. Secrist, son of J.S. Secrist, volunteered as the construction manager with all other laborers volunteering their time as well. Classes began on September 28, <a>1959</a> and within a few years the campus had expanded to women and men&#x2019;s dormitories, a cafeteria, a student center, and a gymnasium.</p>
<p>At the end of the <a>1966</a> school year, <a>D.V. Hurst</a> became the third president of Northwest College. Hurst significantly improved the existing networks established by the <a>Assemblies of God</a> in the <a>Northwest</a>. He began holding info sessions for each district, allowing <a>juniors</a> and <a>seniors</a> to ask questions and meet with their district leaders. He was also the first to produce a hard copy of the policies and procedures of the college in a manual he gave to the faculty.</p>
<p><a>1984</a> marked the 50 year anniversary of Northwest. To commemorate the event, the Lay Council presented the school with a  <a>Ebenezer</a> Stone of Remembrance as a visible sign of thanks to God for the last 50 years. They presented it on May 27, <a>1984</a>, the same day that 173 graduates received their degrees bringing the total number of graduates to 3,460. <a>Don Argue</a>, the president of <a>North Central Bible College</a> was the speaker for graduation.</p>
<p>Northwest College also extended a 20 year lease to the <a>Seattle Seahawks</a> team in 1984 on a  plot of undeveloped land on the west side of campus. The Seahawks signed the lease and built 3 fields, a bubble to house the artificial turf field, and a  office complex. The Seahawks remained at the facilities until 2008 when they moved to a larger facility in <a>Renton, Washington</a>.</p>
<p>After almost 25 years as the president of Northwest College, <a>Hurst</a> decided to retire in the summer of <a>1990</a>. The school had seen physical development, spiritual direction, and academic advance under his guidance and leadership. The board of directors unanimously elected pastor and Superintendent of <a>AG</a> <a>Oregon</a> District <a>Dennis A. Davis</a> to be the fourth president of Northwest College. Above all else, <a>Davis</a> was committed to the highest spiritual aspect of the students, saying that &#x201c;The challenge of the college is to always strengthen the academic programs in response to the mission and purpose of the college and to fulfill that mission and never to detour from it.&#x201d; He invited the students, faculty, and staff to gather on Wednesday mornings for prayer, a tradition that still continues, and offered an open door policy to the students and declared that Wednesday would be &#x201c;Student Day in the life of the President.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Northwest College was also invited to join the <a>Christian College Coalition</a> (now the <a>Council of Christian Colleges and Universities</a>) &#x2013; a large group of Christian schools dedicated to <a>liberal arts education</a> in Christian light. Joining this consortium of colleges and universities led to the possibilities for students to study for a semester either overseas or at other Christian colleges in the country.</p>
<p>In <a>1996</a>, Northwest College began offering an adult degree completion program called <a>Leadership Education for Adult Professionals</a> or <a>LEAP</a>.  Many adults with a <a>high school diploma</a> have the desire to get their college education but do not have the time or money to do so. The LEAP program at Northwest enables working adults to attend night classes to receive a degree. Most of the adults in the program qualify for <a>grants</a> and <a>scholarships</a>, many that they do not have to start paying until they graduate from the program.</p>
<p>After only 8 years as president of Northwest, <a>Dennis A. Davis</a> resigned from his post. <a>Don Argue</a> became  the 5th president of Northwest, but he was no stranger to the institution. His father had taken the pastoral role at <a>Hollywood Temple</a> in the late <a>40&#x2019;s</a> when Northwest&#x2019;s first president Ness had resigned. Argue grew up around Northwest College and knew many of the people who had attended as well as faculty and staff. He had observed Ness and Butterfield&#x2019;s leadership on campus as well. He said about them, &#x201c;Both of these former NC presidents were held in high honor in our home. They were men of vision and spiritual leadership. As a boy I felt my life was positively influenced by these men.&#x201d;  Argue had also served as president of <a>North Central Bible College</a> for 16 years. At his inauguration he committed himself to Northwest College with these words.</p>
<p>&lt;center&gt;<em>&#x201c;We are heirs of the past.</em> <em>We are guardians of the present.</em> <em>We are architects of the future.&#x201d;</em> &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<h3>Recent History</h3>
<p>Northwest College announced the opening of the <a>Mark and Huldah Buntain School of Nursing</a> in <a>1999</a>. Mark and Huldah made a generous donation to the school from the organization they founded called <a>Mission of Mercy</a> in <a>Calcutta, India</a>. The School of Nursing offers a Bachelors of Science degree in <a>Nursing</a> and requires the nursing students to spend a month abroad putting their skills to the test and opening their eyes to some of the hard realities the world has to offer.</p>
<p>In <a>2001</a>, President Argue received word from the National Association of Schools and Colleges that Northwest could offer their first master&#x2019;s degree. Argue took the opportunity and by fall of 2001, Northwest offered the Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology Program. Not only did graduates receive their degree, but became Washington State Board Licensed Professional Counselors. Presently, Northwest University offers eight master&#x2019;s degrees in a variety of avenues.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors made the decision in 2004 to change the name of the college from Northwest College to Northwest University. The decision came after significant enrollment growth as well as growth in the academic programs and degrees offered. Soon after, in <a>2006</a>, Northwest broke ground for the new Health and Sciences Center (HSC) above the Hurst Library. The second floor of the HSC serves as the location for the <a>Mark and Huldah Buntain School of Nursing</a> with offices, classrooms, and practical labs.</p>
<p>At his inauguration on October 27, 2007, <a>Joseph Castleberry</a> became the sixth president of Northwest University. Dr. Castleberry had previously served as the academic dean at the <a>Assemblies of God Theological Seminary</a> in <a>Springfield</a>, <a>Missouri</a>. He had also been a missionary in many capacities in <a>Central</a> and <a>South America</a>, founded the <a>Freedom Valley Project</a> in <a>Ecuador&#x2019;s</a> <a>Chota Valley</a>, and has been published in a variety of books and articles. With regards to the future of Northwest University, Dr. Castleberry has stated, &#x201c;I believe it is within Northwest University&#x2019;s reach to become a world-class model of academic excellence that is loyal to the faith and spiritual power of our forefathers. I can foresee the deployment of Northwest University graduates around the world and an ongoing relationship with them that brings the world to the campus and takes the campus to the world. Given the Northwest Region&#x2019;s rich heritage for foreign missions, such a vision is deeply consistent with our ethos and tradition.&#x201d;</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>300px|thumb|The Donald H. Argue Health and Sciences Center</a> --&gt; On August 14, 2007, the General Contractor released the Certificate of Occupancy for the Health and Sciences Center (HSC). The HSC serves as the home for the Mark and Huldah Buntain School of nursing as well as the University Science Department&#x2019;s  chemistry, biology, environmental studies, and physics labs. The Northwest University Board of Directors unanimously supported the priority of the funding plan for the HSC, the largest fundraising program attempted by the university. Dr. Don Argue, the university president at the time, spearheaded the vision for the HSC. On May 8, 2009, Northwest University formally recognized the former president and current Chancellor for his efforts by naming the building <em>The Donald H. Argue Health and Sciences Center</em>. &#x201c;&#x2019;The new Health and Sciences Center has surpassed our expectations, and we had very high hopes,&#x2019; stated Dan Neary, Northwest&#x2019;s Executive Vice President. &#x2019;The classrooms and the laboratories have been a tremendous boost to both our science and our nursing programs. But even more, this building has become a popular site for conferences, meetings, and receptions. It has quickly become an integral part of our campus, and it&#x2019;s difficult to even remember what it was like here before the HSC was finished!&#x2019;&#x201d;  &#x201c;Two people in particular deserve credit for this merger,&#x201d; says Dr. Castleberry. &#x201c;First, Rev. Bill Wilson, Superintendent of the Oregon Ministry Network, has provided vision and leadership to make it happen. And Dr. Carley Kendrick, President of SBC, has shown the heart of a true servant in this entire process.&#x201d; </p>
<p>In the <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> publication, <em><a>America&#x2019;s Best Colleges</a> 2009</em>, Northwest University ranked 16 in the western region of the 319 national baccalaureate colleges in the nation. &#x201c;&#x2019;It is an honor to be listed among America&#x2019;s best colleges,&#x2019; said Northwest University&#x2019;s president, <a>Joseph Castleberry</a>. &#x2018;As Northwest University adds programs and gets bigger, we are even more committed to getting <em>better</em>, providing the highest quality education. This ranking confirms the capabilities and commitment of our faculty and it is a tribute to them.&#x2019;&#x201d;  In 2009, Northwest University added a Doctorate in Counseling Psychology program. It was the first doctorate program offered by the university.</p>
