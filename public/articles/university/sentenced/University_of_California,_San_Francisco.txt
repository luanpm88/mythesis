<p>  The <strong>University of California, San Francisco</strong> (<strong>UCSF</strong>) is one of the world's leading centers of health sciences research, patient care, and education.
UCSF's medical, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing, and graduate schools are among the top health science professional schools in the world.
The UCSF Medical Center is consistently ranked among the top 10 hospitals in the United States by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/honorroll.htm</a> &lt;/ref&gt; Some of UCSF's most renowned treatment centers include kidney and liver transplant, <a>radiology</a>, <a>neurosurgery</a>, <a>neurology</a>, <a>oncology</a>, <a>ophthalmology</a>, <a>gene therapy</a>, <a>women's health</a>, <a>fetal surgery</a>, <a>pediatrics</a>, and <a>internal medicine</a>.
UCSF also has the nation's leading HIV/AIDS treatment and research centers.
Collaborations with African Universities such as the <a>University of Zimbabwe</a> to deal with HIV have been established.
UCSF is administered separately from <a>Hastings College of Law</a>, another <a>UC</a> institution located in San Francisco.
In recent years, UCSF and UC Hastings have increased their collaboration, including the formation of the UCSF/Hastings Consortium on Law, Science, and Health Policy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Founded in 1873, the mission of UCSF is to serve as a &quot;public university dedicated to saving lives and improving health.&quot;
Though one of the ten campuses of the <a>University of California</a>, it is unique for being the only University of California campus dedicated solely to graduate education, and this in health and <a>biomedical science</a>s.
UCSF has developed a reputation for unique interdisciplinary collaboration between the health science disciplines which has led to some of the most important discoveries in the biosciences.
The graduate-focused environment of UCSF, its relatively small size, and its culture of collaboration allows for a flexibility to translate new discoveries into new treatments hard to find even at many of the world's other top medical centers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|UCSF in 1908, with the streetcar that used to run on Parnassus Avenue</a> UCSF traces its history to Dr. Hugh H. Toland, a <a>South Carolina</a> surgeon who found great success and wealth after moving to San Francisco in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Hugh
Huger Toland (1806&#x2013;1880)</a>, UCSF, <em>Accessed October 6, 2010.</em>&lt;/ref&gt;
A previous school, the Cooper Medical College of the <a>University of Pacific</a> (founded 1858), entered a period of uncertainty in 1862 when its founder, Dr. Elias Samuel Cooper, died.&lt;ref
name = UCSF01/&gt;  In 1864, Toland founded a new medical school, Toland Medical College, and the faculty of Cooper Medical College chose to suspend operations and join the new school.&lt;ref

</p>
<p>The <a>University of California</a> was founded in 1868, and by 1870 Toland Medical School began negotiating an affiliation with the new public university.&lt;ref
name = UCSF02/&gt;  Meanwhile, some faculty of Toland Medical School elected to reopen the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific, which would later become <a>Stanford University School of Medicine</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Chronology of the Stanford University Medical Center</a>, Stanford School of Medicine, <em>Accessed June 11, 2007.</em>&lt;/ref&gt;
Negotiations between the Toland and the UC were complicated by Toland's demand that the medical school continue to bear his name, which he finally conceded.&lt;ref
name = UCSF02/&gt;  In March 1873, the <a>trustee</a>s of Toland Medical College deeded it to the <a>Regents of the University of California</a>, and it became &quot;The Medical Department of the University of California.&quot;&lt;ref
