<p><strong>Michigan Technological University</strong> (<a>abbr.</a>
<strong>Michigan Tech</strong>) is an <a>American</a> <a>public university</a> with a range of degree offerings.
Michigan Tech's <a>campus</a> is located on the <a>Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> in the city of <a>Houghton</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1885 as a response to the needs of the <a>copper industry</a> in the area, the institution has experienced several cycles of funding followed by setbacks.
It has maintained its status through ongoing public-private partnerships, research affiliations, enterprise programs, a strong alumnus, and positive reviews in national educational ranking media.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Michigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the <strong>Michigan Mining School</strong>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.mtu.edu/mtuinfo/history.html</a> |accessdate=2008-01-07&lt;/ref&gt; Established by the state of Michigan to train mining engineers to operate the local copper mines, the school started with four faculty members and twenty-three students.
A few years after the school's creation enrollment grew to such a point that its name no longer reflected its purpose.
The name was then changed to the Michigan College of Mines.
This name lasted through WWI until 1925, but by this time the school had begun offering a wider variety of degrees and once again decided to change its name to the Michigan College of Mining and Technology.
By 1931 enrollment had reached nearly 600.&lt;ref name=history&gt;<a>http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/urel/welcome/history.html</a> |accessdate=2010-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the next few years, due to the great depression, money was scarce causing department heads and even the president of the university, William Hotchkiss, to take pay cuts.&lt;ref
name=history/&gt; Grover C. Dillman was president from 1935-1956.&lt;ref
name=history/&gt; During this time the school underwent many notable changes a few of these include the construction of the memorial union building, a new ice rink, and a new golf course.&lt;ref
name=history/&gt; Around 1948, enrollment passed 2000 students total.&lt;ref
name=history/&gt; In 1956, J. Robert Van Pelt became the new president of the university.
He restarted many PhD programs and created a focus on research.
In the final years of his presidency the school changed from a college to a university, changing its name a final time to Michigan Technological University.&lt;ref
name=history/&gt; The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons according to President J.R. Van Pelt.
First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title.
Also, including &quot;mining&quot; in the name of the college was misleading.
Although engineering still accounts for some 55 percent of all enrollment, the University now offers more than 120 degree programs.
The name Michigan Technological University was chosen in order to retain the nickname of Michigan Tech that had already been in use since 1927.
Along with the new name, Michigan Technological University, the school gained new constitutional status in 1964.
The new status gave responsibility for control of the university to its Board of Control rather than legislature.&lt;ref&gt;&#x201c;Why

Michigan Tech Alumni Relations and the Alumni Association mission is to provide a mutually beneficial link between Michigan Tech alumni and a) the university, b) other alumni, and c) Michigan Tech students (future alumni).
There are many different products and services offered to all alumni and friends including the exclusive HuskyLink online alumni community launched in early 2007.</p>
<h2>School songs</h2>
<p>Michigan Tech has both an official fight song and an official Alma Mater.
At most sporting events, however, both the &quot;<a>Engineer's Song</a>&quot; and &quot;<a>In Heaven There Is No Beer</a>&quot; are played by the <a>Huskies Pep Band</a>, and many students consider these to be the unofficial school songs.
The &quot;Blue Skirt Waltz&quot; is played at home ice hockey games and is called the &quot;Copper Country Anthem.&quot;
During the song, the fans join arms and swing back and forth to the music.</p>
<h2>Campuses and buildings</h2>
<p><a>thumb|210px|Campus view from Mont Ripley</a> The main Michigan Tech campus is located mainly on US 41 in Houghton, Michigan.
It is the safest campus in Michigan, and the among the safest in the United States&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/magazine/dec04/president.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/648/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
Michigan Tech also maintains a building in <a>Hancock</a>; the Ford Forestry Center and Research Forest in <a>Alberta, Michigan</a>; the Keweenaw Research Center at the Houghton County Airport near Hancock (site of vehicle testing, the Winter Driving School)&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.mtukrc.org/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;; the Portage Lake Golf Course in <a>Portage Township</a>, the <a>Mont Ripley</a> ski hill in <a>Ripley, Michigan</a> and the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) in Ann Arbor.
Michigan Tech opened a campus in the New Delhi area, India in 2003.
The University purchased the UPPCO Building one block off of downtown Houghton in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/662/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In addition, the offices of the Michigan Tech Fund are located in the <a>Citizens Bank</a> Building in Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/rbb.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Michigan Tech campus houses the <a>Rhizotron</a>, an underground soil lab that allows for the non-invasive study of underground processes that involve root systems, decomposition, organisms, and bacteria.
The Rhizotron is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service research station located on campus.</p>
<p>Faculty are involved in several <a>distance education</a> programs, with clients such as <a>General Motors</a>.</p>
<p>The Portage Lake Golf Course opened for play in April, 1902.
In 1945 the members could no longer support the needs of the course and sold it to Michigan Tech for the amount of one dollar.
Since then many different improvements have been made such as the addition of another nine holes in 1969.
Then in 1984 the new clubhouse was constructed in place of the original clubhouse.
In 1996 a sprinkler system was installed to modernize the course and keep it playable.
The Portage Lake Golf Course is located only a few miles from the Michigan Tech campus on US-41.</p>

<h4>The Electrical Energy Resource Center</h4>
<p>[[File:MichiganTechnologicalUniversitySignUS41.jpg|thumb|left|Sign on [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan|US 41]]]] The &quot;EERC&quot; is home to both the Department of Electrical Engineering and Michigan Tech Telecom services.
The EERC was built starting in 1974 and opened in 1976, with energy in mind throughout the design.
At the building&#x2019;s groundbreaking in 1974, R.L. Smith (president of Michigan Tech at the time) described the building's intended use in terms of energy, stressing the importance of educating the next generation of engineers to learn to use and transport energy efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,

The building was designed to be energy efficient, hence the lack of large windows on the east and west faces (windows are a major source of heat loss).
In building the EERC, several previous buildings were demolished including Sperr Hall and Hotchkiss Hall &#x2013; only part of Hotchkiss Hall was demolished to build the EERC and the rest was brought down after equipment and personnel had moved into the EERC.&lt;ref

<h4>Chemical Sciences and Engineering Building</h4>
<p>The Chemical Sciences and Engineering Building, Chem Sci for short, was completed in 1969 and originally housed the Chemical Engineering, Chemical, Metallurgy, Biological Sciences, and Humanities departments.
It replaced the second oldest building on campus, the materials processing laboratory, which had housed the shops for several engineering departments.
Since the building has existed, it has had only a few accidents, the most notable two being a ventilation problem causing lead fumes to build up in the labs and the explosion of a batch of volatile chemicals being used in a polymer synthesis process which nearly killed a research assistant, Michael Abbott.
Chem Sci was built for easy modification of key systems in order to keep up with the needs of the lab facilities.
One example of this is the design of the ventilation system, which was placed on the outside of the building and covered in the same red brick as the rest of the structure for easy access during renovations.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan
Technological University Archives &amp; Copper Country Historical Collections Vertical File: Buildings-Chemical Metallurgy&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Mechanical Engineering/ Engineering Mechanics</h4>
<p>The MEEM (also known as the R.L. Smith Building) is semi-famous for being one of the taller buildings in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The building's first floor interior consists largely of &quot;The Fishbowl&quot;, a large, glass-enclosed computer lab, mainly for Mechanical Engineering students.</p>
<h4>Dow Environmental Sciences and Engineering Building</h4>
<p>Michigan Technological University proposed to begin the construction of an environmentally friendly building in the summer of 1996.
The academic and research programs had grown tremendously, so MTU needed to expand.
The building would not only be a valuable upgrade to the students of MTU, but also to the environmental engineering students, geology, biology, and forestry programs.
The primary goal of the building was to help all MTU graduates become environmentally literate, providing leadership for a sustainable future.
The building became known as the Dow Environmental Sciences and Engineering Building.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the Dow building was around $44 million.
MTU was not able to cover the entire cost of the construction of the building, so they needed to find other sources of income.
On May 12, 1993 the Michigan Governor's Office announced that they would be able to contribute $30 million to the project.
This meant that MTU needed to fund the other half of the costs.
Much of the funds to build the Dow building came from donations.
MTU is a public university, so many of their buildings are funded by donations made by alumni, companies, and anonymous funds.</p>
<p>The Dow building currently houses the biology learning center, an exterior solar space- by setting the building back, designers created a courtyard to screen northern winds, making it 10 degrees warmer in all seasons, natural lighting and ventilation, and a rooftop greenhouse for biology research.
All of these innovations were a part of the environmentally friendly way of construction.
Most, if not all of the faculties offices are faced with windows to create natural light.
This helps the university to not only save money, but to help reduce their carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan

<h3>Non-academic buildings</h3>
<h4>Student Development Complex</h4>
<p>The Student Development Complex (S.D.C.) was built in 1980.
The gun range was built as part along with the rest of the S.D.C. in 1980.
Built to handle any cartridges that have a muzzle velocity of up to   per second (f.p.s.) the range is also used for archery shooting&lt;ref&gt;personal email from Zach Simpson, President,Competition Rifle Team&lt;/ref&gt;.
Today, there are three organizations that operate out of the range: the Pistol Club (MTU and Pratical), the Competition Rifle Team, and the Archery Club.
There are also several P.E. and ROTC classes that use the range.
Michigan Tech hockey is currently played in the SDC.
However Tech used to play at the Amphidrome.
Unfortunately the Amphidrome burnt to the ground in 1927.
In its place the New Amphidrome was built in 1928, the New Amphidrome has been renamed to the Dee Stadium.
Tech continued to play at the Dee Stadium until the <a>John MacInnes Student Ice Arena</a> was built in 1972.</p>
<h4>Advanced Technology Development Complex</h4>
<p>The Advanced Technology Development Complex (A.T.D.C.) was built in 2004.
It is a  building that houses the Ford Student Design Center, the Keweenaw Research Center's dynamometer, and lease space for business start-ups &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Ford Student Design Center gives students in the Enterprise and senior design programs shop space to put ideas into practice.</p>
<h4>Residence halls and apartments</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Douglass Houghton Hall</strong>, commonly called DHH, is the smallest and oldest residence hall at Michigan Technological University.
It was built in 1939 when the school&#x2019;s enrollment was reaching 800 and the surrounding community could no longer accommodate the population increase.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass
Houghton Hall was the first residence hall constructed on the Michigan Tech campus.
It was completed in 1939, over 40 years after the campus opened.(<a>http://www.mtu.edu/tools/map/Douglass_Houghton_Hall.htm</a>)&lt;/ref&gt;
The hall was called the Tech Dormitory for its first year, but was then renamed after <a>Douglass Houghton</a>, one of the first geologists in the area&lt;ref&gt;Nordberg, Erik.
&quot;Douglass Houghton Hall.&quot;
Alumnus from the Archives (2004): 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;.
The hall originally housed 200 students, but in 1948 an addition was built on to the building's east side to house an additional 175 students when, once again, the school&#x2019;s enrollment increased.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dorm

  <li><strong>Wadsworth Hall</strong> is a coed dormitory that currently houses approximately 1,100 students.
When the dormitory was first built it could only accommodate 356 people, but two additions have been made to the building since its opening.
The dormitory was built in 1955 and is named after Dr. Marshman E. Wadsworth, who was president of Michigan Tech from 1887 to 1898.
Wadsworth Hall is commonly referred to by its residents as Mother Wads and others as Wads.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tech
dorm named after Dr. Wadsworth.&quot;
<em>The Week That Was</em> 22 June 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Wadsworth Hall was renovated in December 2003 and the project was completed in the fall of 2005.
The renovation of Wadsworth Hall cost around $31.3 million.
The project updated all the plumbing and electrical wiring throughout the building.
It also updated the layout of the building to give the students more privacy, a better community bathroom, and kitchenettes where students could study, cook, and socialize.
The renovations also resulted in an updated cafeteria; the layout was changed from one long line of food to an open-market type of cafeteria, which reduced waiting in line for food.&lt;ref&gt;Fosnes,

&quot;New 'Wads' unveiled&quot; <em>Mining Gazette</em> 21 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li><strong>McNair Hall</strong> has 650 rooms and the complex consists of three buildings; East McNair, West McNair, and a connecting dining services building&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.</li>
<li>The <strong>Daniell Heights Apartments</strong>, often referred to as &quot;The Heights&quot;, were built in the early 1960s to provide living space for staff, faculty and students on campus.
Located behind Hillside Place, this large complex holds 350 apartments.
It is funded completely by its residents and offers a relatively inexpensive housing option.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
As of Fall 2010, with the completion of Hillside Place, Daniell Heights is used primarily for faculty and staff housing.</li>
<li><strong>Hillside Place</strong> was completed in Summer 2010.
This six-story building houses four students per apartment, with individual rooms for each resident.
There is a common kitchen and living area, with two bathrooms inside every apartment.
It serves graduate and undergraduate students who have completed at least one year at Michigan Tech.
Its amenities include a fitness center and lodge that has indoor and outdoor fireplaces and serves as an area for students to socialize.
It is located behind McNair Hall and Wadsworth Hall&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of a very large incoming class in 2008, the Franklin Square Inn, a Best Western located in downtown Houghton, is housing approximately 60 students through an agreement with Housing and Residential Life.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.housing.mtu.edu/fsi/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The residence halls each have a council representing the students of that hall.
The councils are: the Wadsworth Hall Student Association (WHSA), the McNair Hall Association (MHA), and the Douglass Houghton Hall Council (DHHC).
The Inter-Residence Hall Council(IRHC) consists of members from all of these hall councils, as well as several at-large members, and represents all of the residents to the campus and community.</p>
<h3>Campus network</h3>
<p>The campus network at Michigan Tech is a continually evolving entity trying to keep up with the technology curve.
At its heart is an MX960 Ethernet Services Router from Juniper Networks.
This switch provides 10 gigabit ethernet connectivity for the backbone of the network.
Storage is handled by a 100 terabyte network-attached storage/storage area network (NAS/SAN) array.
Junos software is the primary software used for configuring the network.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/case-studies/3520268-en.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>For students, there are two main networks in addition to whatever networks might be used in a computer lab.
The residence halls and university owned apartments have CAT5 ethernet connections running to every room.
These are part of the Resnet network.
There is also a wireless network (called Rovernet) that covers most of every building on campus.
Both of these networks require a login name and password provided by the university upon enrollment to connect to them.
The computer labs for the various departments run on their own networks and require the same login and password as Resnet and Rovernet but will only grant access to students registered for a class in that department or taking a major in that department.
University email is provided by Zimbra and again uses the standard login.
Along with standard email Zimbra also provides limited online document storage (in addition to a networked private H drive that all students have) and a built-in chat system.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>Michigan Tech students are primarily from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois.
The student body is approximately 76% White/Non-Hispanic, 12.8% International, 1.6% Hispanic, 1.5% percent African American, 1.0% Asian, .7%
Native American, .7%
Multiracial, .1% Pacific Islander, and the remaining 5.5% was not supplied.&lt;ref
name=enrollment/&gt;.
The university has recently focused on achieving a more diverse student body, in terms of ethnicity, gender, and areas of study.
A key step in this effort was the recent introduction of several new <a>academic major</a>s, including psychology, biochemistry and molecular biology, <a>Cheminformatics</a>, communication and culture studies, pharmaceutical chemistry, exercise science, sound design, audio production, and theater and entertainment technology.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Students attending Michigan Technological University have a wide range of activities to participate in, whether or not they are living in the <a>residence halls</a>.
In addition to the various small interest groups which form throughout the year, they participate in <a>Greek Life</a>, Student Organizations, and the Enterprise Program; many organize and attend varsity day events, such as K-Day, the Parade of Nations, and the Winter Carnival; furthermore, there are motivational drives to raise student activity levels and involvement in the school community, typically for those without membership in a student organization.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|225px|Students playing Broomball</a> A student organization is a group of students who have formed under a common name, interest, and set of goals.
The size of these organizations varies greatly, from the very large, to the small and specialized.
For example, the Undergraduate Student Government, which despite its name is actually a student organization&lt;ref name=&quot;banweb.mtu.edu&quot;&gt;<a>https://www.banweb.mtu.edu/pls/owa/stuorg.STU_ORG_DATA.p_list?orderby=cat</a>&lt;/ref&gt;, is composed, according to its constitution, of the entire undergraduate body&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://usg.students.mtu.edu/usg/index.php?&amp;curpage=11</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
More specialized groups, such as the various <a>fraternities</a> and <a>sororities</a> located on campus, list in their constitutions that membership pends approval by the organization itself, thus limiting its size.
Many of these groups have long standing histories, such as the WMTU Radio Station, which was chartered in January 1975, while still others are recently established specialty groups, such as the Alpine Racing Team, which was established in January 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;banweb.mtu.edu&quot;/&gt;.</p>
<p>Michigan Tech currently boasts a list of over two hundred different student organizations&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/stulife/stuorg/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;, and the number is continuing to grow at a steady rate.
Any group of students composed of not less than ten members, not including the required faculty advisor, and who has a member-written, university-approved constitution qualifies to be a student organization&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/stulife/stuorg/resources/#stuorgmanual</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/stulife/stuorg/resources/student_organizations_manual.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;. Once this status has been given, the organization may request funding from the Undergraduate Student Government through the submission of a budget proposal&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://usg.students.mtu.edu/usg/index.php?curpage=76</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
Through funding, many of these organizations put on special events, such as the  Winter Carnival, or provide sought-after services to the students, such as WMTU radio.</p>
<p>Notable <a>Student Organizations</a> include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>WMTU-FM</a>, an entirely student-run radio station</li>
  <li><em>The Michigan Tech Lode</em>, an award-winning, weekly published student newspaper</li>
  <li><em>The Daily Bull</em>, a newsletter published five times weekly offering content with a satirical and humorous angle</li>
  <li>The <a>Huskies Pep Band</a>, an integral part to football, men's and women's basketball, and ice hockey</li>
  <li>The Permanent Floating Riot Club, a group of sci-fi, fantasy, science, and game enthusiasts</li>
  <li>The Inter-Residence Hall Council, a governance council and event-planning group representing the one-third of students living on-campus</li>
  <li>Mitch's Misfits, the student section at Husky Hockey home games</li>
  <li>Blue Key, an affiliate of the National Blue Key honor society, which organizes the annual Winter Carnival</li>
  <li><a>Alpha Phi Omega</a>, Epsilon Lambda chapter, National Co-ed Service Fraternity</li>
  <li>Ethnic, cultural, and diversity groups, aimed at exposing the campus to a variety of world views</li>
  <li>Fraternities and sororities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>Greek Life is a part of the &quot;Tech Experience&quot;, and this can be seen in the high level of student participation in the many Greek-sponsored events hosted throughout the school year.
Michigan Tech is currently host to seventeen different fraternities, including three international <a>fraternities</a>, and three local fraternities&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/greek/fraternity.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
Additionally, there are eight <a>sororities</a> on campus, including four local sororities&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/greek/sorority.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt; A&#x0394;A, A&#x039e;Z, &#x03a6;&#x0394;X, and &#x0398;XE.
The four national sororities are A&#x0393;&#x0394;, A&#x03a3;T, &#x0394;&#x03a6;E, and &#x0394;Z.
Events held on campus can be both planned out, and spontaneous.
Students who are interested in <a>Greek Life</a> are encouraged to look at the various campus squares and message boards, where fraternities and sororities will typically publish information pertaining to their scheduled recruitment activities&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sa.mtu.edu/greek/rush.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
Additionally, students already involved can reference the Greek Life Calendar for a list of planned activities.</p>
<p>One of the biggest activities that Greeks participate in is the month long statue competition, which is a favored winter carnival event of both fraternities and sororities at Michigan tech.
Greeks also participate in other school sponsored events like homecoming and spring fling, and they organize the annual Keweenaw Day, or K-Day.

<h3>The Enterprise Program</h3>
<p>Michigan Technological University's Enterprise Program is considered by many to be the University's defining feature.
Originally designed and implemented in the fall of 2000, the Enterprise Program allows students from different disciplines to work together to function as a professional company.
Once established, students work together with industry leaders to solve real world problems, ranging from researching and developing new wireless technologies, the design and manufacture of specialty materials, to the development of an alternatively powered, full scale vehicle.
The program is considered to be a separate <a>curriculum</a> from the student's chosen major, and is typically considered to be a minor program that requires the student to take a certain amount of credit-based participation in each year.</p>
<p>Each year, the university will establish between ten to fifteen different openings, depending on student demand, and industry support.
These openings are then filled by both returning enterprise teams, and potentially new teams as well.
The groups consist of twenty to thirty students from various majors, who are then assigned a specific task by the university staff; in certain cases a team may request their own topic, which is then subject to approval by the university's administration.
Each student is then assigned various roles and responsibilities according to their ability, maturity, and schedule, as evaluated by the university.
Once established, an enterprise is responsible for managing their own budgets, management of multiple projects under their direction, and working with university faculty, who act as mentors and coaches to the students involved.
At the end of April of each year, the various enterprises publish detailed reports outlining their analysis and solution for their particular assignment, and additionally, they will meet with their various industry sponsors to give verbal presentations, and outline their designs and solutions&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.enterprise.mtu.edu/news/about.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>
<p>Notable student enterprises include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aerospace Enterprise, which provides hands-on aerospace education and experience to students.
As part of the <a>University Nanosat</a> program, Aerospace Enterprise placed 3rd and has received over $100k in funding from NASA and the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/71/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
<li>Advanced Motorsports, a consortium of 5 motorsport competition enterprises.
In 2009, the teams have won 2nd overall in the <a>Baja SAE</a> competition in Oregon &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://students.sae.org/competitions/bajasae/oregon/awards.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;,
2nd overall in the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.enterprise.mtu.edu/ams/team_highllights.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;, and 2nd overall in SAE Supermileage with a final fuel economy of   per gallon &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/907/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pavlis Institute for Global Technological Leadership</h3>
<p>The Pavlis Institute for Global Technological Leadership was formed at Michigan Technological University in 2006.
This is a unique program wherein students spend four years learning and applying leadership skills.
The 25 semester hours of courses focus on communication, teaming, business acumen, and globalization.
The heart of the program is the summer between the student&#x2019;s third and fourth year when they prepare for and implement community action programs in developing countries.
Of the five weeks students spend abroad, only two to three days are spent in the company of a university representative although a local on-site representative is available to assist and help in the event of emergencies.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> <a>left|Michigan Tech</a> As the school mascot is the <a>husky</a> (specifically, <a>Blizzard T. Husky</a>), the school's sports teams are known as the &quot;Huskies&quot;.
Michigan Tech competes in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division II <a>Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a>.
The men's <a>hockey</a> team competes in Division I as a member of the <a>Western Collegiate Hockey Association</a>.
Michigan Tech has its own downhill <a>ski</a>/<a>snowboard</a> hill, <a>Mont Ripley</a>, just across <a>Portage Lake</a> from campus, and maintains extensive <a>cross-country ski</a> trails (used for mountain biking in summer).</p>
<p>On June 19, 2008, the Experience Tech fee was passed by popular student vote.
The fee grants students access to Mont Ripley Ski Hill, Portage Lake Golf Course, Husky hockey games, Gates Tennis Center, some events at the Rozsa Center for the Performing Arts, and intramural sports for $64 per semester.</p>
<h3>Special events</h3>

band, Third Coast, performs at Keweenaw Day at [[McLain State Park]].]]</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first Friday of the fall term is K-Day (Keweenaw Day), a university-sponsored, half-day holiday hosted by Greek Life.
It is primarily celebrated at nearby <a>McLain State Park</a>, which is overrun by Michigan Tech students and organizations for the day.
Activities include a student organizations fair, games, swimming, and music.</li>
<li>Michigan Tech began celebrating Homecoming in 1929.
Each year, a new theme was chosen until 1959.
This year marked the first of 48 consecutive Homecomings, except the 50-year celebration, that had a hobo theme.
The Homecoming parade consisted of tissue paper floats until the 1970s when the Phi Kappa Tau float was caught by the wind while it crossed the bridge, but the fraternity decided to enter the float anyways.
It was decided that the float would be ridden as the first true hobo float and from that year on, other organizations followed suit.
They would enter cars that they had bashed up.
This continued until 1982 when a car had its windshield removed and the hood of the car flew up hitting the driver in the face.
The car spun out of control and smashed into a tree, hospitalizing the four Sigma Rho&#x2019;s who were on their way to the parade.
After this year, it was required that cars were registered to prevent future injuries.
The hobo theme was abandoned in 2009, when the administration's sensitivity to the subject of hobos led the University to change the theme to Husky Spirit.
Students have continued to celebrate the hobo theme during the parade and in other events.</li>
</ul>
<p><a>thumb|225px|People gather in Hancock for the Parade of Nations</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each fall Michigan Tech hosts Parade of Nations.
It is an international fest, established for good communication between international students and community.
It was established and first held in 1990 by Betty Chavis.
The Parade is held on the third Saturday of September.
It plays a big role in the life of the community and international students, because it has become a history lesson for both.
The festival usually starts at <a>Hancock High School</a>.
All participants gather there.
Everybody wears beautiful national clothes, there are lots of different colors.
Then parade marches through Hancock and Houghton downtown until it reaches <a>Dee Stadium</a>.

<li>Michigan Tech holds two world records, the largest snowball (21' 3&quot; circumference) and largest snowball fight (3,745), which they accomplished in 2006, as verified by Guinness World Records officials.
They originally held three world records, the third of which was the most people making snow angels simultaneously in a single venue (3,784).
This record was taken from the city of Bismarck, ND, but about a year later, Bismarck took the record back with 8,962 snow angels.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-03-28-snow-angel-record_N.htm</a>]
