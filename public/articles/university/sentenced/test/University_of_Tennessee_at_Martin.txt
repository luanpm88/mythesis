<h2>History</h2>
<p><strong>UT Martin</strong> began in 1900 as <strong>Hall-Moody Institute</strong> in <a>Martin, Tennessee</a>, a Baptist junior college.
In 1927 the school was in danger of closing, and area civic and political leaders asked the state of <a>Tennessee</a> to step in and operate the school under the auspices of the University of Tennessee, which it did, renaming the institution the <strong>University of Tennessee Junior College</strong>.
It operated under this name until 1951, when, with the addition of four-year fields of study leading to a <a>bachelor</a>'s degree, it was redesignated the <strong>University of Tennessee Martin Branch</strong>.
In 1967 it was designated as a primary campus of the UT system and given its current name.
The school grew greatly from the post-<a>World War II</a> era, largely under the influence of the <a>G.
I. Bill of Rights</a>, through the 1960s under the leadership of dean (later chancellor) Paul Meek.
It was noted that the school had almost as many entering freshmen in 1969 as it had overall students in 1961.
Current enrollment is approximately 8,100.
In 1961, it was the first campus in the University of Tennessee system to begin racial <a>desegregation</a>.
A large <a>experiment</a>al <a>farm</a> is operated, and there are several satellite campuses in West Tennessee (and one in <a>Middle Tennessee</a>).</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Given its <a>rural</a> location, much of the focus of the school has been on undergraduate studies in education and agriculture, although many other courses of study are offered, particularly in the liberal arts, and in recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on business and engineering.
There is an active <a>ROTC</a> program, and a school of nursing.
The school is among the top providers of candidates to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis.
There is a small graduate school, with most graduate degrees being conferred in education.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>

<p>The university mascot was changed from &quot;Pacers&quot; to &quot;Skyhawks&quot; in 1995.
The reasoning behind the &quot;Skyhawks&quot; moniker was described thus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first educational institution on the site of UT Martin was Hall-Moody Bible Institute.
The school's athletic teams were called &quot;sky pilots&quot;, a frontier term for preachers in that day, but perhaps the students were thinking of the glamorous flying aces of World War I.</li>
  <li>During World War II, UT Junior College contracted with the Naval War Training Service to help train pilots, who completed their flight training at an airport located on the current site of Westview High School.</li>
<li>Red-tail hawks are indigenous to the West Tennessee region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to being known as &quot;Pacers&quot; the university's teams were called &quot;Volunteers.&quot;
The name was changed in 1971, largely due to fact that, on account of the former junior college status of the school, the teams were often referred to as the &quot;Baby Vols.&quot;</p>
