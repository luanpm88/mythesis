<p><strong>Canisius College</strong> () is a private <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>college</a> in <a>Buffalo, New York</a>, <a>United States</a>.
The college was founded in 1870 by members of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> (Jesuits) from Germany and is named after <a>St.
Peter Canisius</a>.
The college is one of 28 institutions in the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>
<p>The campus sprawls across over a mile of city blocks and includes dedicated athletic facilities along with various academic and residence buildings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Canisius College of Buffalo, commonly referred to as Canisius, has a long and proud history in the city of Buffalo.
The first campus was on Ellicott St. in the city and was created in response to a growing need for higher education in the area.
Buffalo was composed of many ethnic groups and one of the larger populations was German in origin.
As Europe experienced political turmoil, more and more people left for America especially after the failed revolutions of 1848.
By 1866, Prussia had exerted considerable pressure on its Germanic neighbors which cause many more people to leave.
One of the places where many Germans settled was Buffalo, NY.
Part of the immigrant population included German Jesuits.
The college formed with <a>Canisius High School</a> as a natural response to the needs of the Catholic community.
The <a>college archives</a> has an extensive collection pertaining to the history of the college and its founding.</p>
<h2>Schools</h2>
<p>Canisius College has three schools.
They are:</p>
<p><a>College of Arts and Sciences</a></p>
<p><a>Wehle School of Business</a></p>
<p><a>School of Education and Human Services</a>.</p>
<h2>Campaign for Canisius</h2>
<p>In the fall of 2007, the college announced plans to raise $90 million by the year 2010 for capital improvements and to enhance the college&#x2019;s endowment.
It is the largest fund-raising initiative in the college&#x2019;s history.
Of the $90 million goal, $47 million will fund the creation of an interdisciplinary science center at the college.
This impressive undertaking creates a vital physical and visual connection between various parts of the campus through 1901 Main Street.
Included in this program was the full acquisition of a 1,500 space parking ramp which will provide room for additional commuter students.
The college announced on November 20, 2008 the acquisition of the building from The Uniland Partnership of Delaware LP. </p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p><em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranked Canisius as 20th among regional schools in its &quot;North Region.&quot;

<p>Canisius won the Canal Cup in 2008 and 2009.

Canisius has won the trophy two times in the Canal Cup's three year existence.</p>
<p>The Canisius synchronized swim team has been the 3rd place team in the nation since 2008, fielding several national champions in several categories each year.
The team has been ECAC champions since 1996.</p>
<p>Intramural sports are also offered to students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Canisius' mascot is the Golden Griffin.
The college adopted it in 1932, after Charles A. Brady ('33) wrote a story in a Canisius publication honoring Buffalo's centennial year as a city.
Brady wrote about Rene-Robert LaSalle's <a>Le Griffon</a>, the first European ship to sail the upper Great Lakes, built here in <a>Buffalo</a>.
The name stuck, and Canisius' mascot was born.</p>
<p>According to GoGriffs.com, the <a>griffin</a> is a &quot;mythical creature of supposed gigantic size that has the head, forelegs and wings of an eagle and the hindquarters, tail and ears of a lion.&quot;
It represents values such as strength, vigilance, and intelligence, all of which befit a college and qualities that one would look for in students and athletes alike.
</p>
<h3>Pro Football Venue</h3>
<p>The College was also the home field of the <a>Buffalo All-Americans</a> of the early <a>National Football League</a>.
Around 1917, Buffalo manager, <a>Barney Lepper</a>, signed a lease for the team to play their home games at Canisius College.
The All-Americans played several of their games at Canisius before relocating to <a>Bison Stadium</a> in 1924.</p>
