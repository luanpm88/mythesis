<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|left|The Builders of the University Terrace.</a>
When First District Agricultural &amp; Mechanical School&#x2019;s inaugural academic year began in 1908, few could have foreseen a major American university growing out of four faculty members and 15 students in just a little more than one lifetime.
</p>
<p>More than 100 years later, Georgia Southern boasts nearly 20,000 students, 2,000 faculty and staff, and 114 programs of study at the bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s and doctoral levels.
</p>
<p>Founded as a school for teaching modern agricultural production techniques and homemaking skills to rural school children, First District A&amp;M began within two decades to shift its emphasis to meet the growing need for teachers within the state.
Its name and mission were changed in 1924 to Georgia Normal School as a training ground for educators.
Five years later in 1929, full-fledged senior college status was granted and the school was renamed South Georgia Teachers College.

<p>Ensuing decades found more name and mission changes: to Georgia Teachers College in 1939 and Georgia Southern College in 1959.
