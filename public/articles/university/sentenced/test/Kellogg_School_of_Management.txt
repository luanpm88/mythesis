<p>The <strong>Kellogg School of Management</strong> (<strong>The Kellogg School</strong> or <strong>Kellogg</strong>) is the <a>business school</a> of <a>Northwestern University</a> located in <a>Evanston, Illinois</a>, <a>downtown</a> <a>Chicago, Illinois</a> and <a>Miami, Florida</a>.
Kellogg offers full-time, part-time, and executive programs, as well as partnering programs with schools in China, India, Hong Kong, Israel, Germany, Canada, and Thailand.
Degrees granted include MBA, PhD, and a MBA-JD .</p>
<p>Founded in 1908 in downtown Chicago as a part-time evening program, the school was chartered to educate business leaders with &quot;good moral character.&quot;
Kellogg pioneered the use of group projects and evaluations and popularized the importance of &quot;teamwork&quot; and &quot;team leadership&quot; within the business world.
</p>
<p>Kellogg has historically been ranked as one of the top business institutions in the world by <a>BusinessWeek</a>, <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, <a>The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, and other business news outlets.
Alumni from the Kellogg school hold leadership positions in for-profit, nonprofit, governmental, and academic institutions around the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|The Jacobs Center on the Evanston campus.</a>
The school, originally founded in 1908 as Northwestern University's School of Commerce, a part-time evening program, was one of 16 founding members of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the organization that sets accreditation standards for business schools.
As one of the organization's original members, the school later played a major role in helping to establish the Graduate Management Admission Test.
In addition, faculty associated with the school have made contributions to fields such as marketing and decisions sciences.
For instance, Walter Dill Scott, a pioneer in applied psychology, helped establish some of the earliest advertising and marketing courses in the first decade of the twentieth century.
He went on to serve as president of Northwestern University from 1920-1939.
More recently, Philip Kotler and Sidney J. Levy's groundbreaking 1969 Journal of Marketing article, &quot;Broadening the Conception of Marketing,&quot;  laid the foundations for a greatly expanded understanding of marketing.
Similarly, Kotler's Marketing Management text has played a key role in deepening the field's scholarship.</p>
<p>In 1951, Kellogg began offering executive education courses.
The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections.
The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in B&#x00fc;rgenstock, Switzerland.
In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program).
A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs.
The vision of  dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975-2001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably <a>James L. Allen</a>, a Kellogg alumnus and cofounder of consultancy <a>Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct. 31, 1979.</p>
<p>In 1956, the school was renamed as the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills.
In addition, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had largely been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century.
The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors - rather than careers focused solely on traditional business.
To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree.
A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.</p>
<p>These dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965&#x2013;1975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the <em>School of Business</em>) so as to focus its energies solely on graduate education.
In so doing, the school decided to pursue a research-based faculty, quickly attracting a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department, founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor Stanley Reiter.</p>
<p>In 1979, in honor of a $10 million gift made to the school on behalf of <a>John L. Kellogg</a>,[<a>http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20020520/kelloggs.html</a>] the school was renamed as the <em>J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.</em>
The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large student rooming facility designed as a living-learning center.
Even prior to the Kellogg gift, the school had been bolstering its research-based faculty: In 1978 alone the school added six additional &quot;named&quot; professorships and two new research professorships.
In 2001, in an effort to solidify the school's brand, the name was shortened to the <em>Kellogg School of Management.&quot; </em>The story on the Kellogg Centennial site [<a>http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu</a>]
highlights the Kellogg School&#x2019;s journey over the last 100 years<em>.
</em></p>
<p>In June of 2009, Kellogg announced that Dipak C. Jain would step down as dean after eight years of leadership and return to teaching [<a>http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/News_Articles/2009/Dean-Jain-May-2009.aspx</a>].
On September 1, 2009, Sunil Chopra, former Senior Associate Dean:Curriculum and Teaching and IBM Distinguished Professor of Operations Management, assumed as interim dean while the Dean Search Committee worked to find the best candidate to lead the school.
Later in 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building at the northeast corner of its Evanston campus to serve as Kellogg's new home.
The new facility will be located adjacent to Lake Michigan and will include classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces and administrative offices.
As of the announcement date, the timing for completion of the new facility had not yet been determined.[<a>http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/News_Articles/2009/new_building.aspx</a>]</p>
<p>In March of 2010, Kellogg announced that Sally Blount will replace Sunil Chopra as the dean, starting in July.
Blount was the dean of the undergraduate college and vice dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University.[<a>http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/69833de6-3bf0-11df-9412-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=02e16f4a-46f9-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8.html</a>]</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The Kellogg School's Full-Time and Executive MBA facilities are situated along the shores of <a>Lake Michigan</a> in <a>Evanston, Illinois</a> on <a>Chicago's North Shore</a>, while the school's Part-Time MBA program is housed on Northwestern's Downtown Chicago campus in Wieboldt Hall.
Full-time and Executive students of the Kellogg School enjoy access to a private beach, extensive sports and aquatic facilities, bike paths, playing fields and a <a>sailing</a> and <a>windsurfing</a> center.
The downtown campus is in the heart of Chicago, only a few blocks away from either Lake Michigan or Michigan Avenue, and conveniently located near the many Loop office buildings where its students work.
In January 2006, Kellogg opened a new campus for its EMBA program for Latin American executives in Miami.
<a>Kellogg-Miami EMBA Program</a>  Executives fly in from all over Latin America and the United States for weekend courses.
Regardless of location, the Kellogg School EMBA programs deliver the same exemplary content and traditional leadership and teamwork approach that had kept Kellogg consistently in the No. 1 position within EMBA rankings.
</p>
<p>On November 11, 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building to house the Kellogg Full-Time program.
The new facility will be located on the northeast corner of the school's Evanston campus and the timing of its construction will depend upon fundraising efforts.
</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Programs</h3>
<p>Kellogg offers Full-Time MBA, Executive MBA, MMM (MBA + MEM), JD-MBA, and Part-Time MBA, programs, as well as non-degree Executive Education programs.
</p>
<p>The standard Part-Time MBA offers degrees across 19 different areas of focus including (Accounting Information and Management, Analytical Consulting, Analytical Finance, Decision Sciences, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Finance, Health Enterprise Management, Human Resources Management, International Business, Management and Organizations, Management and Strategy, Managerial Economics, Marketing, Marketing Management, Media Management, Operations Management, Real Estate Management, Social Enterprise at Kellogg, and Technology Industry Management.

Most courses are held in downtown Chicago at 340 E. Superior Street and the remainder in the Evanston campus.
Saturday Part-Time MBA program, a program begun June 2007 which is designed for students who do not live near Chicago or travel during the week for work.</p>
<p>The Executive MBA program is offered as a joint degree with the <a>Schulich School of Business</a> at <a>York University</a> in Canada, the <a>WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management</a> in Germany, <a>Tel Aviv University</a>'s <a>Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration</a> in Israel, and  <a>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its MBA programs, the school also offers a PhD program whose principal objective is to train candidates for academic positions in universities.
Seven areas of study are offered at the PhD level: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology (a joint initiative of the Kellogg School and Northwestern University&#x2019;s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences) and Operations Management.
Kellogg also offers a JD-PhD degree that enables doctoral students to earn a law degree and a PhD degree concurrently.</p>
<p>The MMM Program is a dual-degree program for MBA and MEM (Master of Engineering Management) that integrates management, operations and design, from concept to execution.
This program admits approximately sixty students each year and combines the rigors of the Kellogg School's management program with challenging work in operations and design at McCormick, one of the country's leading engineering schools.
MMM students receive the Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management and the Master of Engineering Management from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University.
</p>
<p>The JD-MBA Program is a dual-degree program administered by both Kellogg and the <a>Northwestern University School of Law</a>.
The Northwestern JD-MBA program is completed in 3 years, as opposed to the four years required at most other institutions.
Students graduate with both a <a>Juris Doctor</a> (JD) degree and a <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA) degree.
The program pioneered a unique application process among JD-MBA programs, in that there is a single admissions application and the <a>GMAT</a> is required, but not the <a>LSAT</a>.
In 2010, The University of Pennsylvania revised their JD-MBA application requirements to match those at Kellogg.
The Kellogg JD-MBA program enrolls, on average, 25 students per year.</p>
<p>In addition to degree programs, the Kellogg School offers non-degree executive programs covering an array of topics.
Both open enrollment, custom and longer form general management programs are offered at the Kellogg executive education facility, the James L. Allen Center and at the Kellogg School's Miami campus.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Two of the Kellogg School's other executive MBA programs are also highly ranked by the Financial Times.
The School's Kellogg-HKUST program at the Hong Kong UST Business School is ranked No. 2 in the world, while the school's Kellogg-WHU program at WHU Business School in Germany is ranked No. 12 in the world.</p>

<h2>Students and culture</h2>
<p>Kellogg students are part of a culture that emphasizes <a>teamwork</a> and <a>leadership</a> skills.
Many aspects of the school, from admissions decisions, to admitted students weekend, to orientation week, to the annual conferences and events that the school hosts, are organized and led by students.</p>
<p>Kellogg was the first business school in the world to insist that all applicants be interviewed to assess their leadership potential and suitability for the Kellogg School's cooperative environment.
As a result, in addition to grades, GMAT scores, professional achievement, and demonstrated leadership, 'fit' is an important part of the admissions equation at Kellogg.
</p>
<p>Prior to on-campus orientation many new incoming students go on a Kellogg Worldwide Experiences and Service Trips (KWEST) to destinations all over the world for a week with 25 of their future classmates.
Full-time Kellogg students are grouped into 8 sections (commonly referred to as cohorts at other top business schools): the Poets, Cash Cows, Highlanders, Bucketheads, Bullfrogs, Big Dogs, Jive Turkeys and Moose.
Sections socialize and engage in competition during the first few weeks of Kellogg's orientation, called its Complete Immersion in Management (CIM).
Most students also take first year core courses with their respective sections.
Students completing their graduate studies in an extended 1-year program are designated as a ninth section, the Roadrunners.
</p>
<p>All students enrolled in a course offered by the Kellogg School of Management agree to abide by the Kellogg Honor Code.
The purpose of the Kellogg Honor Code is to promote these qualities so that each student can fully develop his or her individual potential.
Students who violate the Kellogg Honor Code violate this agreement and must accept the sanction(s) imposed by the Kellogg community.
</p>
<p>Kellogg is also known for its amazing entirely student-led annual musical production called &quot;Special K!&quot;, which epitomizes and highlights the myriad talents of its student body.</p>
