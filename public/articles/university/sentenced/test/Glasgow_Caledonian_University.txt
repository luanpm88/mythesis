<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Queen's College, Glasgow</h3>
<p>The origins of The Queen's College, Glasgow date back as far as 1875 when the Glasgow School of Cookery was established.
In 1908, the Glasgow School of Cookery merged with the West End School of Cookery, which had been established in 1878, to form the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science, which was affectionately referred to by Glaswegians as &quot;The Dough School&quot;.</p>
<h3>Glasgow Polytechnic</h3>
<p><strong>Glasgow Polytechnic</strong> was originally planned by the Corporation of Glasgow as two separate colleges on adjacent sites in central Glasgow: the College of Science and Technology and the College of Commerce.
Before opening in 1971 a new polytechnic institution of higher education had been agreed and the Glasgow College of Technology opened to students with the objective of offering <a>Council for National Academic Awards</a> (CNAA) <a>degrees</a> at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
The Scottish Office and the local authority were both opposed to the creation of further Central Institutions in Scotland and the legislation enabling the creation of Polytechnics was specific to England and Wales.
The new institution was constituted under a set of Instruments and Articles of Governance derived from that of the Polytechnics but specific to Glasgow: it had an Academic Board and a Governing Council establishing considerable academic independence but ultimately answerable to the Corporation of Glasgow.
The formal opening of the College took place in 1972.</p>
<p>The College was under the governance of <a>Glasgow Corporation</a> until 1975 when the newly created <a>Strathclyde Regional Council</a> became the <a>funding body</a> and a new <a>constitution</a> was put in place.
In 1985, ownership passed from the Regional Council to an independent <a>board of governors</a> who received their funds directly from the <a>Scottish Education Department</a>.
In subsequent years, the institution changed its name three times for promotional purposes: Glasgow College (1987); 'Glasgow College - A Scottish Polytechnic; and Glasgow Polytechnic (1991).</p>
<h2>Glasgow Caledonian University</h2>
<p>In 1992, The <a>Secretary of State for Scotland</a> approved the <a>merger</a> of Glasgow Polytechnic and The Queen's College, Glasgow to form Glasgow Caledonian University, which opened on 1 April 1993.</p>
<p>The aim of the new university was to offer non-<a>elitist</a>, high quality <a>education</a> and <a>training</a> to a wide and diverse range of <a>students</a>.
It sought to collaborate with commercial and industrial organisations and other providers of education.
The <a>university</a> initially offered more than 140 <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> courses within three <a>faculties</a> and 22 departments.
