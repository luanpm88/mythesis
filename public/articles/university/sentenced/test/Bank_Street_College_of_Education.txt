<p><strong>Bank Street College of Education</strong> is located in <a>Manhattan</a>, <a>New York City</a>.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bank Street was founded in 1916 by <a>Lucy Sprague Mitchell</a> as the &quot;Bureau of Educational Experiments&quot;.
(Mitchell was the first Dean of Women at the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>).
Its original focus was the study of <a>child development</a> and education, but, after two years, it was clear that actual living subjects, i.e. children, were needed, so in 1918 a <a>nursery school</a> was opened.
This nursery school is the direct predecessor of today's School for Children.
It wasn't until the 1930s that Bank Street began to formally <a>train teachers</a>, the start of today's Bank Street <a>College of Education</a>.</p>
<p>In 1965, Bank Street developed the &quot;Bank Street Readers&quot; line of books, which were unique due to their featuring of <a>racial diversity</a> and urban people of contemporary culture.
Also in the 1960s, the Bank Street faculty played an important role in the creation of the federal <a>Head Start program</a>.</p>
<p>The college gets its name from its former location on <a>Bank Street</a> in <a>Greenwich Village</a>.
It moved to its current location in the early 1970s.</p>
