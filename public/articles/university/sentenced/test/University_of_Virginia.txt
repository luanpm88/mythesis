<p>  The <strong>University of Virginia</strong> (also <strong>The University</strong>,&lt;ref&gt;Many universities' students and alumni refer to their respective institutions as &quot;the university&quot; for short.
At the University of Virginia, this title is capitalized as a proper noun (i.e., &quot;The University&quot; or &quot;the University&quot;)[<a>http://www.hrs.virginia.edu/dot/topics/ppd/newsupervisor/university_slang.htm</a>] in reference only to this particular school, much like <a>The Lawn</a> and <a>The Rotunda</a>.
In recent decades many of the school's alumni and students have sported university-licensed bumper stickers and window decals of simply THE UNIVERSITY in the school's colors ([<a>http://www.mincers.com/php-bin/ecomm4/products.php?product_id=514</a>]), a practice not always well understood or appreciated by outsiders, leaving some to declare such usage to be elitist.[<a>http://www.readthehook.com/newcomer.html</a>]
However, the vernacular tradition goes back more than a hundred years, as indicated in the following excerpt from a 1903 novel.[<a>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15573/15573-h/15573-h.htm</a>]&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<strong>Mr.
Jefferson's University</strong>, or <strong>Virginia</strong>; often abbreviated as <strong>U.Va.</strong>
or <strong>UVA</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Charlottesville</a>, <a>Virginia</a>, founded by <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>.
Conceived by 1800 and established in 1819, it is the only university in the United States to be designated a <a>World Heritage Site</a> by <a>UNESCO</a>, an honor it shares with nearby <a>Monticello</a>.</p>
<p>The University is notable in <a>U.S. history</a> for being the first educational institution to offer academic programs in disciplines now common, such as <a>astronomy</a> and <a>philosophy</a>.
Its <a>School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> was the first engineering school in the United States to be part of a comprehensive university.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.che.virginia.edu/history.html</a>
Chemical Engineering - SEAS History&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the University of Virginia is incorporated as <em>The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia</em>.</p>
<p>The early <a>Board of Visitors</a> was filled with former Presidents of the United States: <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a>James Madison</a>, and <a>James Monroe</a>.
Although Jefferson undertook all planning of the University, the land underneath it was once a farm belonging to Monroe.
His farmhouse was located on <a>Monroe Hill</a>, which today is the site of one of three undergraduate residential colleges.</p>
<p>The 2011 edition of <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranks the University of Virginia as the 2nd best public university (tied with <a>UCLA</a>) in the <a>United States</a>, and the overall 25th best university in the nation (tied with <a>Wake Forest University</a> and <a>UCLA</a>).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University is notable for having highly ranked programs including its <a>law school</a> (Ranked 10th), and undergraduate and graduate <a>business schools</a> (Ranked 5th and 13th respectively).
The University is one of the eight original <a>Public Ivies</a>.
</p>
<p><a>Historical secret societies</a> such as <a>Seven</a>, <a>IMP</a>, and <a>Z</a> are very active; as are two rival literary and debating societies, the <a>Jefferson Society</a> and <a>Washington Society</a>.
Many students live in <a>residential college</a>s such as <a>Brown College</a>, <a>Hereford College</a> and the International Residential College.
Yet some aspects of student life are more recognizable to those familiar with other universities across the nation, as there are also <a>fraternities</a> and <a>sororities</a>, and the athletic teams participate in the highly competitive <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a>.
Notably the University has had the highest <a>African American</a> graduation rate of all public universities in the United States for 15 years running.
Achieving a graduation rate of 87% for its black students, UVA topped its nearest public rival, the University of North Carolina, by 11 percentage points in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;JHBE

<h2>History</h2>
<p>On January 18, 1800, <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>, the <a>Vice President of the United States</a>, alluded to plans for a new college in a letter written to British scientist <a>Joseph Priestley</a>: &quot;We wish to establish in the upper country of Virginia, and more centrally for the State, a University on a plan so broad and liberal and modern, as to be worth patronizing with the public support, and be a temptation to the youth of other States to come and drink of the cup of knowledge and fraternize with us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wish&quot;&gt;Noble E. Cunningham, Jr., <em>In Pursuit of Reason: The Life of Thomas Jefferson</em>, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1802, then serving as <a>President of the United States</a>, Jefferson wrote to artist <a>Charles Willson Peale</a> that his concept of the new university would be &quot;on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet.&quot;&lt;ref
name=&quot;Peale&quot;&gt;Alf J. Mapp, Jr., <em>Thomas Jefferson: Passionate Pilgrim</em>, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia was already home to one university, the <a>College of William &amp; Mary</a>, but Jefferson lost confidence in his <em>alma mater</em>, partly because of its religious biases and lack of education in the sciences.&lt;ref
name=&quot;bias&quot;&gt;Phillips Russell, <em>Jefferson, Champion of the Free Mind</em>, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Jefferson flourished under the tutelage of W&amp;M professors <a>William Small</a> and <a>George Wythe</a>, his concerns with the College became great enough by 1800 that he wrote: &quot;We have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.&quot;&lt;ref

University of Virginia stands on land once owned by President [[James Monroe]], who sold the land when he moved into the <a>White House</a>.]]</p>
<p>The University of Virginia stands on land purchased in 1788 by an <a>American Revolutionary War</a> veteran (and eventual fifth <a>President of the United States</a>), <a>James Monroe</a>.
The farmland just outside <a>Charlottesville</a> was purchased from Monroe by the Board of Visitors of what was then <em>Central College</em> in 1817; Monroe was beginning the first of his own two terms in the <a>White House</a>.
Guided by Jefferson, the school laid its first building's cornerstone later in 1817 and the Commonwealth of Virginia would charter the new university on January 25, 1819.</p>
<p>In the presence of <a>James Madison</a>, the <a>Marquis de Lafayette</a> toasted Jefferson as &quot;father&quot; of the <em>University of Virginia</em> at the school's inaugural banquet in 1824.
The University's first classes met in March 1825.
Other universities of the day allowed only three choices of specialization: Medicine, Law, and Religion, but under Jefferson's guidance, the University of Virginia became the first in the United States to allow specializations in such diverse fields as <a>Astronomy</a>, <a>Architecture</a>, <a>Botany</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, and <a>Political Science</a>.
Jefferson explained, &quot;This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind.
For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.&quot;&lt;ref
name=&quot;Reason&quot;&gt;<a>Dumas Malone</a>, <em>Jefferson and His Time: The Sage of Monticello</em>, p. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>An even more controversial direction was taken for the new university based on a daring vision that higher education should be completely separated from religious doctrine.
One of the largest construction projects in North America up to that time, the new Grounds were centered upon a library (then housed in <a>the Rotunda</a>) rather than a church&#x2014;further distinguishing it from peer universities of the United States, most of which were still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular religion or another.&lt;ref
name=&quot;sem&quot;&gt;<a>Joseph J. Ellis</a>, <em>American Sphinx</em>, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jefferson even went so far as to ban the teaching of Theology altogether.
In a letter to <a>Thomas Cooper</a> in October 1814, Jefferson stated, &quot;a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution&quot; and, true to form, the University never had a Divinity school or department, and was established independent of any religious sect.
Replacing the then-standard specialization in Religion, the University undertook groundbreaking specializations in scientific subjects such as Astronomy and Botany.
(However, today the University does maintain one of the highest-rated Religious Studies departments in the U.S. and a non-denominational chapel, notably absent from Jefferson's original plans, was constructed in 1890 near the Rotunda.)</p>
<p>Jefferson was intimately involved in the University, hosting Sunday dinners at his <a>Monticello</a> home for faculty and students, until his death.
So taken with the import of what he viewed the University's foundations and potential to be, and counting it amongst his greatest accomplishments, Jefferson insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the <a>Declaration of Independence</a> and <a>Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</a>, and father of the University of Virginia.
Thus, he eschewed mention of his Presidency and national accomplishments in favor of being remembered for the newly established university.</p>
<p>[[Image:Lawn.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[The
Lawn]] during winter, with tracks through the snow.
At center is the <a>Rotunda</a>, which was the original library building at the head of Jefferson's Academical Village.]]</p>
<p>In 1826, the nation's fourth President <a>James Madison</a> became Rector of the University of Virginia, at the same time America's fifth President <a>James Monroe</a> made his home on the Grounds (at <a>Monroe Hill</a>) and was a member of the Board of Visitors.
Both former Presidents stayed at the University until their deaths in the 1830s.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> opened in 1836, making it the first engineering school in the United States to be attached to a comprehensive university.</p>
<p>At the onset of the <a>American Civil War</a>, the University of Virginia was the largest in the <a>Southern United States</a> and second nationwide only to <a>Harvard University</a> in its scope.&lt;ref
name=&quot;1860size&quot;&gt;<em><a>Encyclop&#x00e6;dia Britannica</a></em>, <a>University of Virginia</a>, retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike many other colleges in the South, the University was kept open throughout the conflict, an especially remarkable feat with its state being the site of more battles than any other.
In March 1865, Union General <a>George Armstrong Custer</a> marched troops into Charlottesville, whereupon faculty and community leaders convinced him to spare the University.
Though <a>Union troops</a> camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the University was able to return to its educational routines.</p>
<p>Jefferson, ever the skeptic of central authority and bureaucracy, had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no President.
Rather, this power was to be shared by a Rector and a <a>Board of Visitors</a>.
As the nineteenth century waned, it became obvious this arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks which had become regrettably but unavoidably necessary amid the inner-workings of the growing University.</p>
<p>[[Image:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Father of the University of Virginia, [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the first and only <a>President of the United States</a> to found an institution of higher learning.]]</p>
<p>In 1904, <a>Edwin Alderman</a> resigned as President of <a>Tulane University</a> to take the same position at the University of Virginia.
As the University's first President, he embarked on a number of reforms for both the University and the state of Virginia's public educational systems in general.
A reform specific to the University of Virginia was one of the first school-sponsored <a>financial aid</a> programs in all of higher learning and, though primitive by today's standards, it included a loan provision for those &quot;needy young men&quot; who were unable to pay.
Initially controversial and opposed by many at what had become a very traditional school, Alderman's progressive ideas stood the test of time.
He remains the longest-tenured President in the University's history, having served for twenty-six years until his death in 1931.
Alderman Library, a popular landmark among today's students, is his namesake.</p>
<p>Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner <a>William Faulkner</a> became writer-in-residence at the University in 1957, keeping open office hours until his death in 1962.
He was also a lecturer at the school, as well as taking the title &quot;Consultant on American Literature to the Alderman Library&quot;.
Faulkner had a large collection of his manuscripts and typesets given to and made available (the request reaffirmed by his wife and daughter) at the library upon his death.</p>
<p>In 2004, resulting from a stark decrease in state support, the University of Virginia became the first public university in the United States to receive more of its funding from private sources than from the state with which it is associated.

<p>Also in 2004, the 100th anniversary of Alderman becoming President, the University announced the AccessUVa financial aid program.
This program guarantees the University will meet 100% of a student's demonstrated need.
It also provides low-income students (up to 200% of the poverty line &ndash; as of 2009, about <a>$44,000</a> for a family of four) with full grants to cover all of their educational needs, and it caps the level of need-based loans for all other students.
This program is the first to guarantee full grants to students of low-income families at any public university in the United States.</p>
<p>In 1944 the <a>Mary Washington College</a> in <a>Fredericksburg, Virginia</a> became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia.
Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as <a>undergraduate</a>s, except in the education and nursing schools.
In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.&lt;ref&gt;<a>University of Mary Washington: History and Development of the University.</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
All-<a>white</a> until 1950 and generally all-male, the University of Virginia is now very diverse.
The story of the racial integration of the University is movingly told in Sarah Patton Boyle's classic book <em>The Desegregated Heart</em> (1962).
Boyle was a faculty wife and civil rights activist who worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (He singled her out for praise in his famous &quot;Letter From Birmingham Jail&quot;.)<strong> </strong>The makeup of the Class of 2008 was 10% <a>African American</a>, 14% <a>Asian American</a>, 5% <a>Hispanic</a>, 5% Other and 5% <a>International</a>; over one-third of the members of the class reported themselves as being non-white.
Approximately eighty-five percent of the University's entering Class of 2009 were ranked in the top 10% of their graduating high school class and 56% are female.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Today, minority students are particularly successful at the University of Virginia.

The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education.
2005</a>&lt;/ref&gt; the University &quot;has the highest <a>black</a> student graduation rate of the <a>Public Ivies</a> at 86 percent.&quot;
The journal goes on to state that &quot;by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The University of Virginia joined with <a>Harvard University</a> and <a>Princeton University</a> as the three universities announced the end of their <a>Early Decision</a> and <a>Early Action</a> programs in September 2006, stating that such policies limit poor and <a>middle class</a> students from competing on an equal footing with applicants from rich families.&lt;ref

<p>Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique <a>Jeffersonian architecture</a>.
In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, <em><a>The New York Times</a></em> said that the design of the University of Virginia &quot;was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century&quot;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;schuyler&quot;&gt;<em>Architectural Record,&quot; 4 (January&#x2013;March 1895), pp.
351-353&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the <a>United States Bicentennial</a> issue of their </em>AIA Journal<em>, the <a>American Institute of Architects</a> called it &quot;the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years&quot;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;aia&quot;&gt;</em>AIA Journal<em>, 65 (July 1976), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the University of Virginia remains an architectural landmark and popular tourist destination.
</em></p>
<p>The University, together with Jefferson's home at <a>Monticello</a>, is a <a>World Heritage Site</a>, one of only three modern sites so listed in the <a>50 states</a>, the others being the <a>Statue of Liberty</a> and <a>Independence Hall</a>.
It was the first collegiate campus worldwide to be awarded the designation.</p>
<p>Jefferson's original architectural design revolves around the &quot;Academical Village&quot;, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of <a>The Lawn</a>, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, <a>The Range</a>, and the larger University surrounding it.
The principal building of the design, <a>The Rotunda</a> (<a>RotundaCam</a>), stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the University.
It is half the height and width of the <a>Pantheon</a> in <a>Rome</a>, which was the primary inspiration for the building.
The Lawn and the Rotunda were the model for many similar designs of &quot;centralized green areas&quot; at universities across the country.
</p>
<p>Most notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by Rotunda-like buildings built at <a>Duke University</a> in 1892, <a>Johns Hopkins University</a> in 1902, <a>Rice University</a> in 1910, Dallas Hall, the central building at <a>Southern Methodist University</a> (1912), Peabody College of <a>Vanderbilt University</a> in 1915, the Green at the <a>University of Delaware</a> in 1916, Killian Court at <a>MIT</a> in 1916 (which was coincidentally founded by <a>William Barton Rogers</a>, who immediately prior to founding MIT was a <a>Natural Philosophy</a> professor at the University of Virginia for 19&nbsp;years), the &quot;Grand Auditorium&quot; of <a>Tsinghua University</a> in <a>Beijing</a> built in 1917, the campus of <a>Yale Divinity School</a> (the Sterling Quad, 1932), and, indeed, the new grounds of the University's own <a>Darden School of Business</a> (designed by Robert A.M. Stern).
</p>
<p>Flanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student rooms.
Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls.
These walls are called &quot;serpentine&quot; because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.
<a>Frank E. Grizzard, Jr.</a>, a former scholar at the University, has written the definitive book on the original academic buildings at the University.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Grizzard,

<p>On October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms.
The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the unfortunate help of overzealous faculty member <a>William &quot;Reddy&quot; Echols</a>, who attempted to save it by throwing roughly 100&nbsp;pounds (45&nbsp;kg) of <a>dynamite</a> into the main fire in the hopes that the blast would separate the burning Annex from Mr. Jefferson's own Rotunda.
His last-ditch effort ultimately failed.
(Perhaps ironically, one of the University's main honors student programs is named for him.)
University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect <a>Stanford White</a> to rebuild the Rotunda.
White took the charge further, disregarding Mr. Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interior &mdash; making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a President's House.
He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza.
The classes formerly occupying the Annex were now moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.</p>
<p>Although undoubtedly useful to the University in providing additional classroom space, and not unattractive, if pedestrian in comparison to the Jeffersonian Pavilions, the White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains.
The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge &quot;quadrangle&quot;, albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the <a>University of Cambridge</a> or <a>University of Oxford</a>.</p>
<p>In concert with the <a>United States Bicentennial</a> in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design.
Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Inside the Dome Room of the Rotunda</a></p>
<p>Though student enrollment has grown well beyond the original Lawn facilities, the University further distinguishes itself by extending the original Academical Village ideal with two exclusively First-Year (freshman) living areas: The Old Dorms (Bonnycastle, Dabney, Echols, Emmet, Hancock, Humphreys, Kent, Lefevre, Metcalf, Page), located on <a>McCormick Road</a>, and The New Dorms (Cauthen, Courtenay, Dunglison, Dunnington, Fitzhugh, Kellogg, Lile, Maupin, Tuttle, Webb, Woody), adjacent to <a>Scott Stadium</a>, both situated wholly on Grounds and considered integral to establishing peer discourse.
The common bonding experience proves such a fixture to the University experience, students often identify themselves by individual &quot;Old&quot; or &quot;New&quot; dormitory.
First-Year living areas also include <a>Hereford College</a>, <a>International Residential College</a>, and <a>Brown College at Monroe Hill</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001, <a>John Kluge</a> donated 7,378&nbsp;acres (30&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of additional lands to the University.
Kluge desired the core of the land to be developed by the University, and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core.
A large part of the gift was soon sold to musician <a>Dave Matthews</a>, of the <a>Dave Matthews Band</a>, to be utilized in an <a>organic farming</a> project.
It is unknown what the University will do with its &quot;core&quot; portion of the land.</p>

Admission to the University of Virginia is competitive, with 90.2% of admitted applicants ranking in the top 10% of their high school classes.&lt;ref
name=&quot;uva-2011stats&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A December 2005 <a>National Bureau of Economic Research</a> study of &quot;high-achieving&quot; undergraduate applicants found U.Va., at twentieth overall, to be the most preferred college located in the state of Virginia, some twenty-three spots ahead of the next highest ranked Virginia school (<a>Washington and Lee University</a>), and the second-most preferred in the <a>American South</a>, just one spot behind <a>Duke University</a>.
The study also revealed the University to be the most preferred <a>public university</a> in the entire United States, placing five spots above both the <a>Georgia Institute of Technology</a> and the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>&lt;!--GT and UCB tied at 5.17--&gt;.
The stated purpose of the NBER study was to produce a ranking system that &quot;would be difficult for a college to manipulate&quot; by basing it on the actual demonstrated preferences of highly meritorious students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Early Decision Abolished, Reinstated</h3>
<p>Three American universities &mdash; <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, and the University of Virginia &mdash; announced in September 2006 that they were discontinuing their <a>Early Decision</a> or <a>Early Action</a> rounds of admission in an effort to promote economic diversity in their student bodies.&lt;ref
name=&quot;EarlyDecision1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyDecision2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Early Decision programs force a student to accept an offer of admission before evaluating the <a>financial aid</a> offers of various universities, while Early Action entails no commitment upfront but may also prevent a comparison of offers before making a decision.
The <a>College Board</a> states that an applicant &quot;should not apply under an Early Decision or Action plan if he plans to weigh offers and financial aid packages from several colleges later in the spring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Through the 2006-2007 admissions cycle, 30% of each class at the University was made up of Early Decision applicants.
Financially, their families were far wealthier than those of other students at the University.
In the most recent year, only 1 student received a full financial aid package under the AccessUVa program out of 947 students who were accepted under Early Decision.&lt;ref
name = &quot;EarlyDecision4&quot;/&gt;  Less than 2% of Early Decision candidates applied for any financial aid at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyDecision3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 2008 admissions cycle, there was no early round at the University for the first time since the 1960s&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyDecision4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and all undergraduate applications were due on one date.
The University again received a record number of applications despite eliminating the Early Decision admissions round.
</p>
<p>In November of 2010, the University announced it would again offer non-binding early action for entering members of the class of 2016.&lt;ref

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Degrees from the University of Virginia must be earned academically &ndash; there has never been an honorary degree offered.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The University of Virginia does not award honorary degrees.
In conjunction with the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, the University presents the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture and the Thomas Jefferson Award in Law each spring.
The awards, recognizing excellence in two fields of interest to Jefferson, constitute the University's highest recognition of scholars outside the University.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The policy was instituted by Thomas Jefferson.
When the Virginia Legislature's Committee of Schools and Colleges was reconsidering it in 1845, then-U.Va.
professor and future <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> founder <a>William Barton Rogers</a> wrote, &quot;[T]he legislators of the University have, we think, wisely made their highest academic honor&mdash;that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia&mdash;the genuine test of diligent and successful literary training, and, disdaining such literary almsgiving, have firmly barred the door against the demands of spurious merit and noisy popularity.&quot;
When MIT was chartered in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1861, Rogers carried the U.Va.
policy through to the new institute.&lt;ref&gt;:&quot;MIT's
founder, William Barton Rogers, regarded the practice of giving honorary degrees as 'literary almsgiving ... of spurious merit and noisy popularity....' Rogers was a geologist from the University of Virginia who believed in Thomas Jefferson's policy barring honorary degrees at the university, which was founded in 1819.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref

<h2>Rankings and recognition</h2>
<p>In 2009 and 2010, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the University of Virginia as the number two public university among &quot;National Universities&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2011 edition, the undergraduate program at U.Va.
ranked &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;2 out of roughly 200 public universities in the United States, tied with <a>UCLA</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews-public2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;25 overall (including private schools), tied with UCLA, <a>University of Southern California</a>, and <a>Wake Forest</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 26-year history of the rankings, U.Va. has never dropped out of the Top 25 listing and has always ranked either &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;1 or &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;2 among public schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In every published edition of the report going back to 1983, the undergraduate program at the University has also retained its position as the highest ranked school, public or private, in its home state of Virginia.
<a>Forbes Magazine</a> ranked the University &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;44 in its 2010 ranking of U.S. universities, the highest ranking for a public university on the list.&lt;ref

In addition, due in part to <a>California Proposition 209</a> and the <a>Michigan Proposal 2</a>, the University also has much higher African American populations than these peer universities.
The University of Virginia has an undergraduate student body that is 8.7%&lt;ref&gt;<a>University of Virginia Fall Headcount Enrollment by Race</a> Retrieved November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; African American, while the <a>University of California</a> undergraduate student bodies at Berkeley and UCLA are just 3.2%&lt;ref&gt;<a>UC Berkeley Enrollment Data</a> Retrieved November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.7%&lt;ref&gt;<a>UCLA Student Enrollment</a> Retrieved November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; African American, respectively.

The current Athletic Director at Virginia is <a>Craig Littlepage</a>.
The <a>Virginia Cavaliers</a>, also called &quot;Wahoos&quot; or &quot;Hoos&quot;, have won 20 recognized national championships, 15 of them since 1980.
Virginia has won multiple national titles in five different sports, including three men's sports (<a>lacrosse</a>, 6; <a>soccer</a>, 6; and <a>boxing</a>, 2) and two women's sports (<a>lacrosse</a>, 3; and <a>cross country</a>, 2).
It also holds a national championship in <a>track and field</a>.
The men's <a>college basketball</a> team has won either the ACC regular season (1981, 1982, 1983, 1995, 2007) or <a>ACC Tournament</a> (1976) titles six times and has been to the <a>Final Four</a> twice, while the women's squad has been three times.

The arena's inaugural year witnessed the Virginia men's basketball team's first place finish in the ACC.</p>
<p><a>Davenport Field</a>, where the <a>UVa baseball team</a> plays, is also new, opening in 2002.
In <a>Brian O'Connor</a>'s first 4 seasons at the helm after being made the head baseball coach in July 2003, the team has averaged 44 wins per year and become a nationally-ranked power.
The team has led the ACC in team <a>ERA</a> for 4 consecutive years.
In 2009, the baseball team won a place in the <a>College World Series</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>The soccer teams are also national powers, with men's soccer having won 6 national championships to date including its most recent in December 2009.
The women's team is regularly ranked in the top 10 nationally.
The teams play their home matches at <a>Kl&#x00f6;ckner Stadium</a>, the largest soccer stadium in the ACC.
The men's team has been invited to the NCAA Tournament for 26 consecutive years and made the College Cup many times.
Former Coach <a>Bruce Arena</a> has coached the US national team and currently coaches the <a>Los Angeles Galaxy</a> in <a>Major League Soccer</a>.</p>
<p>The Aquatics and Fitness Center (<a>webcam</a>) has been popular among University students for working out and swimming since its opening in Fall 1996, and it is also where the <a>Swimming</a> &amp; <a>Diving</a> teams compete in home meets.
The men's swimming and diving team won 8 consecutive ACC Championships between 1999 and 2006.</p>
<p>Also winning consecutive ACC titles has been the men's tennis team, which has won 4 consecutive regular season ACC Championships.
Playing their home matches at the <a>Sheridan Snyder Tennis Center</a>, the men's tennis team had their best season ever in 2007, finishing with a 30-4 record and a #2 national ranking.
<a>Somdev Devvarman</a> became the first ACC player in conference history to win the NCAA Singles Championship, which he won in two consecutive years.
In addition, the tennis team beat Ohio State for the 2008 National Indoor Tennis Championships, 4-1.</p>
<p>Now that <a>Virginia Tech</a> has joined the ACC, the <a>Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry</a> has been strengthened across a number of sports.
This rivalry between the University and its larger neighbor to the southwest is followed statewide.
UVA's athletic teams have bested the <a>Hokies</a> through the years in <a>many of the major sports</a>.
The two universities also faced off in the <a>Commonwealth Challenge</a> between 2005 and 2007, with the Cavaliers routing the Hokies in each Challenge: 14.5 to 7.5 in 2005-2006 and 14 to 8 in 2006-2007.
The competition was then dropped out of sensitivity following the <a>Virginia Tech massacre</a>.</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p><a>The Cavalier Song</a> is the official fight song of the University of Virginia.
The song was a result of a contest held in 1923 by the University.
The Cavalier Song, with lyrics by Lawrence Haywood Lee, Jr. and music by <a>Fulton Lewis, Jr.</a>, was selected as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Traditions
- University of Virginia Cavaliers Official Athletic Site - VirginiaSports.com&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the second half of the song is played during sporting events.
Until the 2008 football season, the entire fight song could be heard during the <a>Cavalier Marching Band</a>'s entrance at home football games.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Student life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions.
The campus of the University is referred to as &quot;the Grounds.&quot;
Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years in order to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a never-ending process, rather than one to be completed within four years.
Also, students do not &quot;graduate&quot; from the University; instead, they &quot;take&quot; their degrees.
Professors are traditionally addressed as &quot;Mr.&quot;
or &quot;Ms.&quot;
instead of &quot;Doctor&quot; (although medical doctors are the exception and are called &quot;Doctor&quot;) in deference to Thomas Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title.</p>
<p>In 2005, the University was named &quot;Hottest for Fitness&quot; by <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> magazine,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities.
Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, situated across the street from the Alderman Dorms.</p>
<p>The University of Virginia sent more workers to the <a>Peace Corps</a> in 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;Peace Corps1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;Peace Corps2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; than any other &quot;medium-sized&quot; university in the United States.
Volunteerism at the University is centered in <a>Madison House</a>, which offers numerous opportunities to serve others.
Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, and an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food made at restaurants to Charlottesville's homeless rather than allowing it to be thrown away.</p>
<p>A number of <a>secret societies at the University</a>, most notably the <a>Seven Society</a>, <a>Z Society</a>, and <a>IMP Society</a>, have operated for decades, leaving their painted marks on University buildings.
Other significant secret societies include <a>Eli Banana</a>, <a>T.I.L.K.A.</a>, the <a>Purple Shadows</a> (who commemorate Jefferson's birthday shortly after dawn on the Lawn each April 13), The Sons of Liberty, and the <a>21 Society</a>.
Not all the secret societies keep their membership unknown, but even those who don't hide their identities generally keep most of their good works and activities far from the public eye.</p>
<p>[[Image:Boyd Tinsley 7-5-08 Rothbury MI.JPG|175px|thumb|left|[[Boyd Tinsley]]'s &quot;jam sessions&quot; would last for entire nights while he was a student at the University, attracting not only college musicians, but professional musicians as well; such as <a>Jorma Kaukonen</a> of <a>Jefferson Airplane</a>.]]</p>
<p>Student Societies have existed on grounds since the early 19th Century.
The <a>Jefferson Literary and Debating Society</a>, founded in 1825, is the oldest collegiate debating organization in the United States, and the second oldest Greek-Lettered organization in the nation.
It continues to meet every Friday at 7:29 PM in <a>Jefferson Hall</a>.
The <a>Washington Literary Society and Debating Union</a> also meets every week, and the two organizations often engage in a friendly rivalry.
In the days before social fraternities existed and intercollegiate athletics became popular, these Societies were often the focal point of social activity on grounds.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Jefferson Society&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several fraternities were later founded at the University of Virginia including <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a> (March 1, 1868) and <a>Kappa Sigma</a> (December 10, 1869).
Many of these fraternities are located on <a>Rugby Road</a>.</p>
<p>The student life building on the University of Virginia is called Newcomb Hall.
It is home to the Student Activities Center, where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups.
Most publications on grounds are produced here, as it is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper <em>The Declaration</em>, <em><a>The Cavalier Daily</a></em>, and the Consortium of University Publications.
It is also home to the University Programs Council, which uses money from student activities fees to provide events for the student community.
Newcomb Hall includes a dining hall, a theatre, a ballroom, an art gallery, and several rooms for magazine and newspaper production.</p>
<p>A national publication's survey recently revealed that U.Va.'s students give their library system higher marks than students at any other school in the United States.
The best-known library is Alderman Library for the humanities and social sciences, which contains 10 floors of stacks with many useful study nooks hidden among them.
U.Va.'s renowned Small Special Collections Library feature one of the premier collections of American Literature in the country as well as an <a>original copy</a> of the <a>Declaration of Independence</a>.
It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English Graduate Student, discovered an unpublished <a>Robert Frost</a> poem from 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost-Poem&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clemons Library, next to Alderman, is a popular study spot.
Hundreds of students can be found gathered on its various quiet floors on any given night.
Clark Hall, home of the Science &amp; Engineering Library, also scores high marks.
Clark Hall is also notable for a large Greek-style mural on the ceiling and walls of the library entrance.
, the University and <a>Google</a> were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>As at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students at the University.
Responding to the prevalence of alcohol and a recent tradition observed by a portion of the student body called the Fourth-Year Fifth (where some fourth-year students strive to drink a fifth (750&nbsp;ml) of alcohol during the day of the last home football game),&lt;ref name=&quot;4thYear5th&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; President Casteen announced a $2.5 million donation from <a>Anheuser-Busch</a> to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006.&lt;ref
name=&quot;SocialNorms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman said: &quot;the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students.&quot;</p>
<h3>Student Safety</h3>
<p>While <a>Charlottesville</a>, which typically registers zero to three murders per year, is generally considered a safe city, students have been involved on both sides of homicides in recent history.</p>
<ul>
  <li>On March 22, 1986, physiology graduate student Pat Collins disappeared after using an ATM in downtown Charlottesville.
He was never found.</li>
<li>On November 8, 2003, student Andrew Alston stabbed an Albemarle County firefighter to death during a fight on 14th Street.
His manslaughter sentence resulted in a jail term of three years, prompting allegations&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of special treatment for students.</li>
<li>On May 3, 2010 in what has become known as the <a>UVA Lacrosse Killing</a>, 22-year-old UVA <a>women's lacrosse</a> player Yeardley Love was found unresponsive in her 14th Street apartment.
Later that day, former romantic partner and then-current lacrosse player George Huguley was charged with her murder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student Events</h3>
<p>One of the largest events at the University of Virginia is called Springfest.
It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert and various inflatables and games.</p>
<p>Another popular event is <a>Foxfield</a>, a <a>steeplechase</a> and social gathering that takes place nearby in <a>Albemarle County</a> in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia and neighboring colleges.&lt;ref
name=&quot;foxfield&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Honor System</h2>
<p>&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 16.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #999999; background: #FFFFFF; text-align: left; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;<strong>HONOR PLEDGE</strong>&lt;/div&gt; On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>The University of Virginia has an honor code, formally known as the Honor System.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The <a>Honor System</a> is entirely student-run and was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death.&lt;ref
name=&quot;dabney-honor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the student was expected to hold himself to a gentleman's code of conduct.
In the wake of the shooting, law professor <a>Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.</a> proposed a basic honor pledge as a gesture of confidence in the honor of Virginia students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>TUCKER,
Henry St. George - Biographical Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times however, the Honor System is composed of only three tenets: a student will not <a>lie</a>, <a>cheat</a>, or <a>steal</a>.
It extends to all matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the University.
This is called the &quot;single sanction&quot;.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|A plaque regarding 150 years of the Honor System, placed on the Lawn in 1992</a> The system is not without its detractors &mdash; it has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
As the system is entirely student run, a change to the Honor Committee constitution could have the effect of ending the single sanction system of punishment.
Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded.
Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the Spring of 2007 a referendum to limit single sanction failed to pass by the necessary 60% margin after earning only 49.5% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
</p>
<p>In theory, the Honor System allows the faculty to do such things as assign timed take-home examinations, and research or studies to be done in a particular way, with the assurance that the strictures placed on the student will be observed.
However, no professor is required to extend such courtesies.
The student is often required to sign all examinations or assignments with the following pledge: &quot;On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.&quot;
The Honor System allows the student to purchase books and supplies on-Grounds upon giving his or her word to pay, and some members of the Charlottesville community accept the word of the student regarding off-Grounds business transactions.</p>
<p>While cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), one large cheating scandal occurred in 2001.
Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, had suspicions that some of his students had copied portions of their term papers from <a>fraternity</a> archives in his Introduction to Physics class.
After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters.
Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the University.
Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked.</p>
<h2>Summer Enrichment Program (University of Virginia)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Summer Enrichment Program</strong> (SEP) was founded in 1979 by Dr. Carolyn Callahan to discover gifted students entering fifth through eleventh grade.
It is a twelve day camp that was originally located at the University of Virginia but has since moved to <a>St.
Anne's-Belfield School</a>.
This camp is for gifted and talented students, who are divided into 5-8 and 9-11 groupings.
Students live in the University of Virginia dorms.
The camp offers three summer sessions.&lt;ref
