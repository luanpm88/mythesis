<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Gloucestershire</strong> is a <a>university</a> primarily based in <a>Gloucestershire</a>, <a>England</a>, spread over four campuses, three in <a>Cheltenham</a> and one in <a>Gloucester</a>.
A campus in London has been sold .
The current <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> and Chief Executive Officer (until July 2011) is Dr. Paul Hartley.
In 2009/2010 several formerly senior figures in the university resigned.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university is the recent successor of a large number of merged and name-changed institutions of further and higher education.
Its history began with the Mechanics' Institute founded in 1834.
From 1992, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education (CGCHE) was permitted to award first and postgraduate degrees and 1998 it achieved Research degree awarding powers.
However, it was only in 2001 that the University of Gloucestershire was awarded university status.
Its history spans nearly two centuries.</p>
<p><a>Dame Janet Trotter</a> was the founding Vice-chancellor and Principal, retiring in 2006.</p>
<p>The University of Gloucestershire has pursued an environmental sustainability strategy since 1993, and was the first UK university to meet the <a>ISO 14001</a> environmental management standard.
In 2008 it was declared the greenest University in the UK.
The University of Gloucestershire is also an active participant of the <a>ERASMUS programme</a> and the only UK university to be part of the <a>BCA</a> Programme offering semester abroad, most notably with the USA.</p>
<p>In October 2008, the University was subject to a journalistic investigation on student initiation rites, after the <a>BBC</a> obtained a copy of a secretly-filmed video featuring students with bags over their heads drinking and vomiting, overlooked by another student dressed in what the press described as a &quot;Nazi officer uniform&quot;.
A further incident resulted in a Rugby club member vomiting on board a bus, following what a local newspaper called a &quot;booze-fuelled initiation ceremony&quot;.</p>
<p><a>Simon Pegg</a>, the comic actor and director who plays <a>Scotty</a> in the 2009 revamp of <a>Star Trek</a>, received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Gloucestershire on the 4th of December 2008, for his contribution to the arts.</p>
<h3>2009/2010 resignations</h3>
<p>In November 2009, Paul Bowler, the deputy vice-chancellor of the University resigned shortly after being suspended from his post only seven months after joining the institution.
Paul Bowler, a former investment banker who joined Gloucestershire in May 2009, was on a week's leave when he was told not return to work.
On 7 December, a university spokesperson said, &quot;The deputy vice-chancellor Paul Bowler, has resigned.
Financial benefits have not been sought by Mr Bowler, who is leaving of his own accord to pursue other interests&quot;.</p>
<p>In December 2009 Dr Sharp, Dean and Associate Pro Vice-chancellor, following his resignation, took up a post in the new UK Higher Education International Unit.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor, <a>Professor Broadfoot</a>, resigned in March 2010, during conflicting views on the financial health of the institution.</p>
<p>In May 2010 the Chancellor, Lord Carey, resigned.</p>
<p>In September 2010 Paul Bowler was a witness in an employment tribunal case brought by a member of staff of the University under the  &#x2018;whistleblowing&#x2019; legislation - the <a>Public Interest Disclosure Act</a>.
The tribunal found for the complainant and outcome was reported in the higher education press.</p>
<h2>Campuses and courses</h2>
<p>The university's undergraduate courses include <a>Business Management</a>, <a>Computing</a>, Media, Art &amp; Communications, <a>Geography</a>, <a>Biology</a>, Social Science, Education and Sports.</p>
<p>The university currently has currently over 9,500 full and part-time students, and has four campuses located in Cheltenham and Gloucester.
A campus in London was sold in April 2010.
Each campus is equipped with IT and library resources.
The four faculties in the university were restructred to three from September 2010 being renamed as: Faculty of Media, Arts and Technology; Faculty of Business, Education and Professional Studies; Faculty of Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>Decisions taken by the University to close the Pittville Campus and the London Campus (see below) have been condemned by the <a>University and College Union</a> (UCU) as resulting from bad management </p>
<h3>Pittville Studios</h3>
<p>Pittville Studios is located on Albert Road and is the home of the Faculty of Media, Art and Communications.
Founded as <em>Cheltenham School of Art</em> over 150 years ago <a>thumb|150px|Chapel at Francis Close Hall Campus.</a></p>
<p><a>thumb|150px|Oxstalls campus</a></p>
<h3>Francis Close Hall</h3>
<p>FCH is based in the restored historic buildings at Francis Close Hall, nearest to Cheltenham's town centre, being just a short walk away from Cheltenham's lively bars, clubs, friendly terraced streets, department stores, specialist shops, community cafes, diners and restaurants.
The campus has a mix of Humanities, Education and Natural &amp; Social Science subjects.
Halls of Residence is available in Shaftsbury hall (on campus), Hardwick Halls and Regency Halls, all featuring ensuite single study bedrooms.
Further accommodation includes St Georges, St Mary's, Maidenhorn and Whitehart .</p>
<h3>The Park</h3>
<p>The Business School is located on this campus providing education for business, management, law, marketing, computing, leisure, tourism and hospitality.
</p>
<p>The Park is the largest of the campuses and holds the most events.</p>
<p>Halls of Residence are available in the Park villas, Challinor, Eldon &amp; Merrowdown and Eldon &amp; Merrowdown Annexe located on and next to the campus.</p>
<p>A partnership with the <a>Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> was launched in April 2009, and the Park Campus grounds became designated as a public nature reserve.
The garden includes over 900 trees, both native and ornamental, a shallow lake, and a meadow with native species.</p>
<h3>Oxstalls</h3>
<p>Oxstalls campus is located in the heart of Gloucester, only five minutes drive from the city centre.
The campus reopened in 2002 (having been previously used for Computing and Business courses in the late 1980s/early 90s) and has quickly gained a reputation for its friendly and sociable atmosphere where students and staff mix together.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Sport, Health and Social Care is located at Oxstalls campus.
This Faculty brings together a range of programmes and activities that embrace what is often described as the Government's 'modernisation agenda' of public services.
At the heart of this agenda is an inter-professional approach to policies in sport and physical activity, health, social work, social care, community regeneration, education and social exclusion.
Halls of Residence are available in Oxstalls Halls (on campus), Ermin Hall and Upper Quay all with ensuite single study bedrooms.</p>
<h3>The London Campus</h3>
<p>The London Campus was established thirty years ago as the <a>Urban Learning Foundation</a> (ULF) with the aim of enhancing the quality of initial teacher training.
In September 2003, the ULF became part of the University of Gloucestershire.
The London Campus offered a one year Postgraduate Certificate in Primary Education and was the base for the North East London Graduate Teacher Programme (Primary).
The university arranged and supervised Teaching Placements in urban schools for students from other colleges around the country.
</p>
<p>&#x00a3;8.3 million pounds was spent refurbishing the London campus.
Following the refurbishment, it reopened in February 2009.</p>
<p>The university announced the closure of the London Campus in September 2009.
<a>Times Higher Education</a> quoted a spokeswoman as saying &quot;We have decided to consolidate our business in Gloucestershire, reducing operational costs.&quot;
This, as with Pittville Studios was another casualty of issues related to the funding cap on recruitment by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the 'financial difficulties' of the University of Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>The London Campus has been sold for &#x00a3;9.7 million to LHA London Limited .
The LHA  was founded in 1940 to help people made homeless by the Blitz.
Today with 12 sites across the city they provide affordable accommodation for more than 1450 students, young professionals and those new to London, providing quality accommodation.</p>
