<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:RobertsonDavies.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robertson Davies]], the founding master of Massey College]] Massey College was conceived by <a>Vincent Massey</a>, the 18th <a>Governor General of Canada</a> who attended <a>University College</a> as an undergraduate.
Of the establishment of a new graduate college, Massey wrote, &quot;It is of great importance that it should, in its form, reflect the life which will go on inside it and should possess certain qualities&#x2014;dignity, grace, beauty, and warmth.&quot;
The <a>Massey Foundation</a>, for which Vincent Massey served as a trustee, provided the <a>financial endowment</a>.
</p>
<p>Opened in 1963, the college was designed by Canadian architect <a>Ron Thom</a>, who subsequently designed the master plan for <a>Trent University</a>.
<a>Alan Beddoe</a> designed the Massey College coats of arms.</p>
<p>The founding Master of Massey College (1963&#x2013;1981) was the celebrated Canadian journalist and author <a>Robertson Davies</a>, CC.
Professor J. N. Patterson Hume, CM, was the second Master (1981&#x2013;1988) and Professor Ann Saddlemyer, OC, the third (1988&#x2013;1995).
The fourth and current Master (1995&#x2013;  ) is the distinguished journalist <a>John Fraser</a>, CM.</p>
<p>Massey is home to an <a>ecumenical</a> worship space, St. Catherine's Chapel, the interior of which was originally designed by stage designer <a>Tanya Moiseiwitsch</a>.
The Chapel features an 18th-century Russian <a>iconostasis</a> and a baroque-style pipe organ.
The chapel was extensively redesigned in 2006 by the College architects, Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe and rededicated in June 2007.</p>
<p>During the 2006-2007 academic year, the College hosted the King and Queen of Sweden, held a special tribute in honour of its Founding Master, Robertson Davies, and was the host of the  <a>Man Booker International Prize</a> in April 2007.</p>

Additionally, three other <em>ex-officio</em> members are nominated to the governing corporation by the <a>Massey Foundation</a>.
