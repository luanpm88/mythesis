<p> <strong>Benjamin Wadsworth</strong> (February 28, 1670 &ndash; March 16, 1737) was an early American clergyman and educator.
He was trained at <a>Harvard College</a> (<a>B.A.</a>, 1690; <a>M.A.</a>, 1693).
He served as minister of the <a>First Church in Boston</a>; and as <a>president</a> of Harvard from 1725 until his death.</p>
<p><strong>Wadsworth House</strong></p>
<p>Built in 1726 for the president of Harvard, Benjamin Wadsworth, and his wife, Wadsworth House has had a long and illustrious history.
It is the second oldest building at Harvard (the first being Massachusetts Hall), and General George Washington briefly set up his first headquarters in the house from July 3 to about July 14, 1775 before transferring to the larger John Vassall house (now the Longfellow House) on Brattle Street.</p>
<p>In 1849, when Jared Sparks decided to stay in his nearby home, presidents ceased to live in Wadsworth House.
After that time, Wadsworth House took in student boarders (including Ralph Waldo Emerson '21) and visiting preachers, among others.
Today, the building houses the offices of the University Marshal, Commencement, the University Library, and several professors.</p>
