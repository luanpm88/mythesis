<p>The <strong>University of Abertay Dundee</strong>, usually known simply as <strong>Abertay University</strong>, is a <a>Modern University</a> in <a>Dundee</a>, Scotland.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>The University of Abertay Dundee</a> was created in 1994, under government legislation granting the title University to the <strong>Dundee Institute of Technology</strong>.
This organisation - focussed on broadening educational access to the working classes of Dundee - was founded in 1888 as Dundee College of Technology.
It was recognised as an &quot;industrial university&quot; by the <a>Scottish Office</a> as early as 1902 and gained independent degree-giving authority in the 1970s.</p>
<h2>Profile and reputation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Right|The student library.</a>
The courses offered by The University of Abertay are aimed at taking students from all backgrounds into rewarding careers.
The University prepares graduates with real skills for employment, and has moved beyond offering traditional academic subjects.
Working closely with local, national and international businesses ensures Abertay's degrees are tailored to industry demands.</p>
<p>One of Abertay's biggest success stories is its computer games courses.
As the first University in the world to offer a &quot;computer games&quot; degree, The University of Abertay is at the forefront of providing talented technical graduates with advanced skills in digital design, computer programming, maths and physics - all of which are crucial to effective games creation.
</p>
<p>The international <a>Dare to be Digital</a> games design competition shows this process in action.
Teams of students from around the world each summer compete to create a new game in just ten weeks.
Working with industry mentors, the teams experience the same studio environment as working with a major company - as do the students on Abertay's courses.
The teams are also nominated for a unique BAFTA award, the Ones to Watch.
Only Dare competitors are eligible for this prestigious prize.</p>
<p>The computer games work at Abertay has seen two major new developments - the building of the UK's first Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, as well as a <a>multi-million pound business support programme</a> to create new prototypes and new digital companies.</p>
<p>Abertay is also highly regarded for its industry-guided approach to subjects such as forensic science, urban water management, mental health and counselling, food science, biotechnology, business management and many, many more.</p>
<p>In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) declared Abertay the best modern university in Scotland for research into environmental sciences, law and psychology.</pre>
<p>Particularly exciting areas of research currently under way at Abertay include using soil science to understand the threats of climate change, combining environmental management and 3D modelling to plan sustainable cities, solving crimes by finding fingerprints on fabrics, and training police firearms officers using digital simulations of crime situations.</p>

<h3>Institute of Arts, Media and Computer Games</h3>
<p>The <a>Institute of Arts, Media and Computer Games</a> has strong links with major companies, which inform the contents of all courses.
These range from games programming at the science and technology end, to narrative-based animation at the arts end.</p>
<p>All the courses are Skillset accredited, with the Institute being awarded prestigious Skillset Media Academy status.
This award recognises that the courses offered are producing highly employable graduates with industry-relevant skills.</p>
<p>The Institute&#x2019;s teaching spaces are like the studio environments used by modern creative companies &#x2013; games programmers work alongside animators and visual artists, and sound technologists create content for computer games and other interactive media products.</p>
<h3>School of Computing and Engineering Systems</h3>
<p>Abertay offered the world&#x2019;s first &#x2018;ethical hacking&#x2019; degrees, which are just one part of what the <a>School of Computing and Engineering Systems</a> teaches.
Other courses include computing and networking, web design, and engineering systems.</p>
<p>The ethical hacking courses &#x2013; offered at undergraduate and postgraduate level &#x2013; teach students to hack systems, so they can develop countermeasures and highly powerful computer security systems.
</p>
<p>This applied approach is common to the other courses on offer, which include new degrees in engineering systems and security informatics.
The first teaches sophisticated computer control of manufacturing processes, while the second is aimed at using technology to understand and prevent major international crimes.</p>
<h3>School of Contemporary Sciences</h3>
