<p> <strong>Minzu University of China</strong> () is a  national-level <a>university</a> located in <a>Beijing</a>, <a>China</a> designated for <a>ethnic minorities in China</a>.
It is colloquially known as <em>M&#x00ed;nd&#x00e0;</em> in <a>Putonghua</a>.
It was formerly known in <a>English</a> as the <em>Central University for Nationalities</em> (<em>CUN</em>).</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The Chinese name has the meaning &quot;central ethnic university&quot;, suggesting a national-level university focused on serving minority ethnic groups.
The old English name translated the ethnic term as &quot;nationalities&quot;, based on the term used in <a>German</a> and <a>Russian</a> language <a>Marxist</a> texts.
On 20 November 2008, the university changed its official English name,.
apparently citing concerns that &quot;central&quot;  might imply a location in the geographical centre of China (as it does in <a>South-Central University for Nationalities</a>), and the old name did not sound good.
The name change of <a>Renmin University</a> has been cited as a precedent.
The new name obscures the university's ethnic character, although student opinion has focused more on the fact that it makes obsolete the university's nickname, &quot;the village&quot;.
The Chinese word for village () has a <a>Hanyu pinyin</a> spelling similar to the English abbreviation &quot;CUN&quot;.
In mainland Chinese culture, <a>villages</a> have homely connotations.</p>
<h2>Academic programmes</h2>
<p>The university awards <a>undergraduate</a>-level degrees in 55 academic subjects, usually after four years of study.
There are also 64 <a>master's</a> programmes and 25 <a>doctoral</a> programmes.
While young people from the majority <a>Han</a> group are the largest single ethnicity amongst the fifteen thousand students, 60% of the students and more than one third of the academic staff are from other nationalities.</p>
<p>By far the strongest research areas are <a>anthropology</a> and <a>ethnology</a>, which are the mainstays of its small publishing house and journal.
In 2001, the <a>People's Daily</a> described CUN as &quot;China's top academy for ethnic studies.&quot;

Other respected departments are the <a>dance</a> school and the various minority language and literature departments.
Other subjects are often studied from the ethnic minorities' perspective, e.g., biology courses may focus on the flora and fauna found in ethnic minority areas of China.</p>
<p>Minzu University also participates actively in <a>social sciences</a> research.
Its social science departments are ranked twentieth in mainland China.
In particular, its economics, management, law and history departments are growing into be dynamic research institutions with the help of <a>Project 985</a>.</p>
<p>The university is the pinnacle of a national network of institutions maintained by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, although academic standards are also monitored by the <a>State Education Commission</a>, which means some students end up sitting for two sets of exams.</p>
<p>In English-speaking countries, Minzu University's main partners are the <a>University of East London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a>, and the <a>Oregon University System</a> <a>USA</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Communist Party of China</a> first established a Nationalities Institute in its <a>Civil War</a> stronghold of <a>Yan'an</a>, in central China, in October <a>1941</a>.
In <a>1950</a>-<a>1952</a>, this was merged with other ethnolinguistic and sociological departments, including elements of <a>Peking University</a> and <a>Tsinghua University</a>.
The result was the Central Institute for Nationalities, which officially opened on 11 June 1952.
The Institute was assigned a large area of parkland on the outskirts of <a>Beijing</a> as its campus.</p>
<p>Both the Yan'an and Central institutes were intended to train cadres (officials) for ethnic minority areas, as well as providing a <a>liberal arts</a> education for promising students from the minorities.
Their research was and is intended to support the policies of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission.
In its early years, the Institute was caught up in the sensitive issue of classifying China's vast population into official ethnic groups, until the <a>Cultural Revolution</a> made conventional education almost impossible.</p>
<p>With the advent of <a>Deng Xiaoping</a>'s reform and opening up policy (c.<a>1978</a>), the Institute went through considerable changes.
On the down side, it lost most of its campus to a variety of development projects and it is now in a heavily built-up area.
Financial pressures in the early 21st century led to a rapid rise in student numbers, particularly of Han students.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Institute expanded into science subjects during the 1980s and achieved university status on 30 November 1993.
In 1999 it was granted &quot;key university&quot; status as part of &quot;<a>Project 211</a>&quot;, which was supposed to identify one hundred Chinese universities which would play leading roles in the 21st century.
Since 2004 the university has been a participant in <a>Project 985</a>, a major national programme to raise 39 universities to world-class status.
The campus has been almost completely reconstructed as part of this programme.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haidian has continued to develop as <a>Beijing</a>'s main university district.
CUN is now adjacent to the <a>National Library of China</a> and <a>Zhongguancun</a>, which local media refer to as &quot;China's silicon valley&quot;[<a>http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30837.htm</a>].
In 2006 a large site was acquired in Beijing's <a>Fengtai</a> district, and it is likely that a second campus will be constructed there.</p>
<h2>Weigongcun</h2>
<p>Minzu University of China dominates one side of the Weigongcun () area, also home to <a>Beijing Foreign Studies University</a> and <a>Beijing Institute of Technology</a>.
It has restaurants from a wide variety of ethnic minorities.
According to Minzu University anthropology professor Zhuang Kongshao, the area has been the <a>Uyghur</a> ghetto in Beijing since the <a>Yuan Dynasty</a>, when it was known as Weiwucun (&quot;Uyghur village&quot;, presumably ) and was a local shopping area.
The <a>Qing</a> scholar Qiao Songnian claimed in 1834 that the Uyghurs had been brought there by <a>Yuan Taizu</a>.
The name Weigongcun is first recorded only in 1915, and removes any reference to Uyghurs.
Others attribute the ethnic variety solely to the presence of CUN.
Most of the Uyghur district was razed around 2001.
Baranovitch notes that &quot;the Xinjiang Village of Weigongcun became according to many people a centre of criminal activity&quot;, including &quot;drug dealing&quot;.</p>
