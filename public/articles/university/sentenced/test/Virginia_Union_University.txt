<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>American Baptist Home Mission Society</a> founded the school in 1865 shortly after Union troops took control of <a>Richmond, Virginia</a> at the end of the <a>American Civil War</a>.
Approximately 4 million former <a>African American</a> slaves, or  freedmen, were to become citizens, although many had been deprived of formal education and prevented from becoming literate by Southern state laws.
Southern states were in upheaval after the war.
Both planters and freedmen were trying to figure out what a free labor market would entail.
</p>
<p>Members of the <a>American Baptist Home Mission Society</a> (ABHMS) proposed a &quot;National Theological Institute&quot; to educate freedmen wishing to enter the Baptist ministry.
Soon, the proposed mission was expanded to offer courses and programs at college, high school and even preparatory levels, to both men and women.
This effort was the beginning of Virginia Union University.
</p>
<p>Separate branches of the National Theological Institute were set up in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> and <a>Richmond, Virginia</a>, with classes beginning in 1867.
In Washington, the school became known as <a>Wayland Seminary</a>, named in commemoration of Dr. <a>Francis Wayland</a>, former president of <a>Brown University</a> and a leader in the anti-slavery struggle.
The first and only president was Dr. <a>George Mellen Prentiss King</a>, who administered Wayland for thirty years (1867&#x2013;97).
Famous students there included Dr. <a>Booker T. Washington</a> and Dr. <a>Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.</a>  established in Richmond, Virginia in 1883, became a part of Virginia Union University.
<a>Storer College</a>, an historically black <a>Baptist</a> college in <a>West Virginia</a> (founded in 1867), merged its endowment with Virginia Union in 1964.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>School of Theology</h3>
<p>Virginia Union University's Theological training program is called &quot;The Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University&quot;.

<p>Virginia Union's gymnasium, Barco-Stevens Hall, is located in the former <a>Belgian</a> Pavilion from the 1939/1940 <a>World's Fair</a> in <a>New York</a>.
Due to the outbreak of World War II, the Pavilion could not be returned to Belgium.
The Belgian government sponsored a competition to determine the building's new home.
