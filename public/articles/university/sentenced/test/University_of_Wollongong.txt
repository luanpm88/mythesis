<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Wollongong was founded in 1951 when a Division of the then <a>New South Wales University of Technology</a> (re-named the <a>University of New South Wales</a> in 1958) was established in Wollongong.
In 1962 the Division became the Wollongong University College.</p>
<p>On the 1st January 1975, the University of Wollongong was incorporated by the <a>New South Wales Parliament</a> as an independent institution of higher learning consisting of five Faculties (Engineering, Humanities, Mathematics, Sciences, and Social Sciences), with Professor <a>Michael Birt</a> as its inaugural Vice Chancellor.
In 1976 Justice <a>Robert Marsden Hope</a> was installed as Chancellor of University.</p>
<p>In 1977, the computer science faculty developed a version of <a>Unix</a> for the <a>Interdata 7/32</a> called <a>UNSW 01</a>, this was the first non-PDP Unix.</p>
<p>In the late 70s, Tim Berners-Lee sourced TCP/IP software, an integral element of the World Wide Web, from the University of Wollongong.</p>
<p>In 1981, Dr <a>Ken McKinnon</a> was appointed Vice Chancellor overseeing the amalgamation of the University with the Wollongong Institute of Education(also known as WIE) in 1982.
The Wollongong Institute of Education had originated in 1971 as the Teachers College (renamed the Wollongong Institute of Education in 1973)</p>
<h3>Overseas expansion</h3>
<p>In 1993, UOW opened what was to become the <a>University of Wollongong in Dubai</a> (UOWD) in the <a>United Arab Emirates</a>.
Initially called the Institute of Australian Studies (IAS), this centre made UOW the first foreign university to open a campus in the UAE, and the first Australian tertiary institution represented in the <a>Persian Gulf</a>.
IAS initially offered English language programs, before becoming a 'feeder college' by 1995, where students completed part of a degree in Business or IT in Dubai before coming to Australia to complete their studies.
In 1999, it was the first foreign-owned institution in the world to be issued a licence from the Federal Government of the United Arab Emirates, and was formally opened as University of Wollongong, Dubai Campus in October 2000.
It was officially incorporated as University of Wollongong in Dubai in 2004.</p>
