<h2>History</h2>
<p>  What is known today as <strong>Azusa Pacific University</strong> is the product of the merger of three <a>Southern California</a>-area Christian institutions: Azusa College, an independent Bible School; <a>Los Angeles Pacific College</a>, a <a>Free Methodist</a> liberal arts college; and Arlington College, a <a>Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)</a> school.</p>
<p>Azusa Pacific University was established as the Training School for Christian Workers in 1899 in Whittier, California, the first Bible college on the West Coast.
</p>
<p>In 1939 the Training School became Pacific Bible College, and four-year degrees were offered.
In 1956, the name was changed to Azusa College.
Azusa College merged first in 1965 with Los Angeles Pacific College and became Azusa Pacific College, and three years later, APC merged with Arlington College.</p>
<p>Upon its achievement of university status in 1981, the college changed its name to Azusa Pacific University.
During that decade, off-site educational regional centers throughout Southern California were instated and <a>master&#x2019;s degree</a> programs were first approved.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Azusa Pacific began offering not only undergraduate, but also graduate degrees, and during that decade the university&#x2019;s first three <a>doctoral programs</a> were awarded.
Student enrollment doubled, and graduate programs quadrupled throughout the decade.
</p>
<p>In November 2000, then-Executive Vice President Jon R. Wallace, DBA, became president.
Under Wallace&#x2019;s leadership, Azusa Pacific University continued to grow.
The university now offers more than 60 areas of undergraduate study, 26 master&#x2019;s degree programs, and 7 doctorates to a total student population of more than 8,100.</p>
