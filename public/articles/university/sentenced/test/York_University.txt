<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|York University Goddess of Democracy</a> Star offensive lineman John Magri rejected offers from Florida, Standford, Alabama and Oregon in order to participate in the Lions' prestigious football program.
York University, a non-denominational institution, was established in 1959 by the <em>York University Act</em>.
&lt;ref&gt;<a>York University Act, 1959</a>&lt;/ref&gt; which received <a>Royal Assent</a> in the <a>Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> on 26 March of that year.&lt;ref

<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref
name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a <a>board of governors</a> (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref

<p>In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, <a>Glendon College</a>, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.&lt;ref

<p>In 1965, the university opened a second campus on Toronto's northern outskirts.
The <a>Glendon</a> campus became a <a>bilingual</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> led by <a>Escott Reid</a>, who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister <a>Lester Pearson</a>, who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;<a>York

Petrol storage facilities are still located across the street.
Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the <a>brutalist</a> designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate.
In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a <a>hockey arena</a>.
The <a>Rexall Centre</a> tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the <a>Canada Masters</a> tennis tournament.
As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up <a>Greater Toronto Area</a> (GTA), and in particular, near the <a>Jane and Finch</a> neighbourhood.
Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location.</p>
<p>On November 6, 2008, the York University Senate suspended classes because of a strike by <a>CUPE</a> Local 3903.
The local represents contract professors, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants.
Classes resumed on Monday, February 2, 2009 after back-to-work legislation was passed by the Ontario Legislative Assembly&lt;ref&gt;<a>National Post.

<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p>York University has eleven faculties including the Faculties of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies (which was formed in July 2009 by the merger of the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies and the Faculty of Arts), <a>Science</a> and <a>Engineering</a>, and <a>Glendon College</a>.
Some faculties' programs overlap: for instance, more than one house separate mathematics departments, although some of these are being merged; the <a>Schulich School of Business</a> offers undergraduate and graduate International Business Administration programmes and the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies offers a Bachelor of Administrative Studies, as well as a minor in Business, to be taken in conjunction with a major in another discipline.
The Schulich School of Business offers undergraduates with the option of pursuing a BBA or iBBA program with a component of mandatory exchange.
Also, Glendon, and Schulich units are offering or are in the processing of preparing to offer degrees in public policy and administration.
The University administration has, however, taken steps in some cases to unify departments in separate faculties, in part to support York's efforts to brand itself as a university focused on interdisciplinarity.
For example, the Faculty of Health, opened on 1 July 2006, houses the School of Health Policy and Management, School of <a>Kinesiology</a> and Health Science, School of Nursing, and the Department of <a>Psychology</a>.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are seven libraries and archives at York, five of them (Scott, Steacie, Peter F. Bronfman, Leslie Frost, and Clara Thomas) constituting <a>York University Libraries</a>, plus the <a>Archives of Ontario</a> and the library of <a>Osgoode Hall Law School</a>.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Keele Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|An outdoor art exhibit outside of Scott Library, Keele Campus</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>York's primary campus (&quot;The Keele Campus&quot;) is located in the former municipality of <a>North York</a>.
Most of the University's faculties reside here, including Arts, Fine Arts, Environmental Studies, Science and Engineering, Education, and Health.
All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus.</p>
<p>York has over 375,000 living alumni.
Although a large number of alumni live in Ontario, a significant number live in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Alberta, New York, and Washington, D.C.  York also has over 25,000 alumni internationally.</p>
<p>York alumni, faculty, or former faculty have been awarded 12 Nobel Prizes and 14 Pulitzer Prizes.</p>
<h3>Glendon</h3>
<p><a>Glendon College</a>, a bilingual liberal arts faculty which conducts its own recruitment and admissions and hosts its own academic programs, is also housed on its own campus on Bayview Avenue in North Toronto.
Glendon is the only university-level institution in central Southern Ontario that offers university courses in both <a>French</a> and <a>English</a>; others elsewhere in Ontario include the <a>University of Ottawa</a> and <a>Laurentian University</a> in <a>Sudbury</a>.
A shuttle bus runs regularly between the Glendon and the Keele campuses.
Glendon students are free to take courses at the Keele campus (and vice-versa).
However, there are students who feel getting from one campus to the other to be inconvenient thus the attractiveness of this option is not universal.</p>
<h3>Schulich School of Business  and Osgoode Hall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Seymour Schulich Building at York's Keele Campus</a></p>
<p>While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto.
Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre, while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre located at 1 Dundas Street West.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>York has more than 50,000 students enrolled.
Many students come from the Greater Toronto Area, but there is a sizeable population of students from across Canada and abroad, making York one of the most international universities in Canada.
To serve this large population, there are 225 student clubs and organisations; six student-run publications and three broadcast programs; six art galleries; 33 on-campus eateries; and a retail mall.
Undergraduate students at York are represented by the <a>York Federation of Students</a>, a student-elected body that sponsors most of the clubs and engages in lobbying with the university administration and the <a>provincial</a> and <a>federal</a> governments.

<h3>Newspapers and other publications</h3>
<p><em><a>Excalibur</a></em> has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966.
In 2008, the <em>YU Free Press</em> was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://yufreepress.org/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Colleges and some programs also have individual newspapers or magazines.
They include: <em>The Flying Walrus</em> (Stong College), <em>MacMedia</em> (McLaughlin College), <em>The Pipe</em> (Calumet College), <em>Winters Free Press</em> (Winters College), <em>SOFA</em> (Spotlight On Fine Arts), <em>The Lexicon</em> (Norman Bethune College), <em>The Vandoo</em> (<a>Vanier College</a>), <em>Obiter Dicta</em> (Osgoode Law School), <em>Pro Tem</em> (Glendon College), <em>The Insider</em> (Schulich School of Business), <em>The Phoenix</em> (Founders College), and <em>The Atkinson Beat</em> (Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies).</p>
<p><em><a>Existere</a> &#x2013; Journal of Arts and Literature</em> (est.
1978) is a national publication with local and international contributors.
It is financed by Vanier College Council.
The journal publishes short fiction, poetry, non-fiction and art from novices and seasoned veterans.
Several major writers got their early start in Existere.</p>
<p><em>YorkU Magazine</em> (est.
2003) is the official magazine of York University.
It publishes five times per year in hard copy and digital editions.</p>
<p>The University is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the <a>York Lions</a>.
Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the &quot;<a>Yeomen</a>&quot;, after the <a>Yeomen Warders</a>, the guardians of the fortress and palace at the <a>Tower of London</a>, otherwise known as Beefeaters.
Later, the name &quot;Yeowomen&quot; was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports.
Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a &quot;Yeowoman&quot; was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit.
In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the University replaced both names with the &quot;Lions&quot;, as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme.
The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams.
Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the &quot;York Lionesses&quot;, even though the name &quot;Lion&quot; is intended to apply to both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Canadian

<p>At sporting events, and in a host of frosh week events on campus, students are often heard singing and chanting the cheer &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot;:</p>
<p>:Deep in the heart of the York U Jungle, :You can hear the Lions rumble, :Oo Oo, YU YU, Oo Oo, YU YU</p>
<p>Another York Fight song that is used at Homecoming games is:</p>
<p>:The red and white are waving over the field :Our team is fighting with the spirit that will not yield :Rah rah rah! :Hail to thee O York U :We'll fight for you :Once again the Lions will reach victory!</p>
<p>There are also college songs, particularly from the friendly feuds between Stong College and Bethune College, and the infamous Winters College and <a>Vanier College</a> cheer songs.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p>Until 1989, membership in a <a>fraternity or sorority</a> at York University was forbidden.
In 1989, the related senate resolution was revoked and replaced with Presidential Regulation Number 5&lt;ref&gt;<a>Presidential Regulation: Presidential Regulation Number 5 - Regulation Denying Official Status to Fraternities and Sororities</a>.

The reasons given in this regulation are that fraternities and sororities deflect students from participation in the College system, that their commitment to exclusivity is in conflict with York's principles of inclusivity (no student club is allowed to deny membership except on the grounds of major&lt;!--What?--&gt;, for those organisations with representation to their department), and are often associated with inappropriate conduct.
Over the years, however, two fraternities and three sororities have operated, unofficially, on campus:</p>

<h2>Transit==&lt;!--
This section is linked from York University --&gt;</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|A TTC Orion V bus at York</a> York University is sometimes referred to as a &quot;commuter school&quot;.
Over 65% of the students and staff have home addresses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), particularly in York Region and downtown Toronto.
Many students are opting for public transit owing to York's high parking fees.
York intends to increase the fees for parking for the 2009/10 academic year to combat the congestion around the campus and to assist the fight for making Toronto more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Close to fourteen hundred buses move people through the campus each day; a proposed <a>extension of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line</a> would help alleviate this problem.
It would run directly under the campus, creating new stations at Keele and Finch (<a>Finch West</a>), at the centre of campus (<a>York University</a>), and at Steeles Avenue, interfacing with York Region Transit (<a>Steeles West</a>).
As of 10 A.M., Friday November 20, 2009, express buses on the very frequent 196 route now use the dedicated <a>York University Busway</a> to get from Downsview Station to York Lanes in about 15 minutes.
It consists of bus-only lanes on the Allen Road/Dufferin Street, and bus-only roadways through a hydro corridor north of Finch Avenue West, and along the east side of the campus.
York University's Glendon and Keele campuses are served by the <a>Toronto Transit Commission</a>.
The Keele site is also served by <a>York Region Transit</a> buses (both regular and <a>Viva</a>) from the immediate north, <a>GO Transit</a> express buses from several other Toronto suburbs and colleges or universities and <a>Greyhound buses</a> for regional transportation.
The department of Security, Parking and Transportation Services operates a shuttle service to GO Transit's York University train station on its Barrie corridor.</p>
<p>As of September 20, 2010, <a>Z&#x00fc;m</a> Queen Street route provides service from downtown <a>Brampton</a> to York.</p>
<h2>Campus safety</h2>
<p>York University Department of Security Services provides security services on the university's campuses.
York Security Services provide uniformed security staff which consist of campus liaison officers (community services unit) and the Investigative Unit which works closely with the <a>Toronto Police Services</a>.
The investigative unit and Toronto Police Investigative Units and 31 Division work jointly on serious investigations.
Patrols are conducted on foot, bicycle and vehicle.
The security service is a member of the Ontario Association of College and University Security Administrators (OACUSA) and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA).
The campus community is over 55,000 people.</p>
<p>The department uses marked Ford Crown Victorias which are clearly identifiable with low-profile LED roof lights.
The department responds to all calls for service, however incidents of a criminal nature should be reported to Toronto Police.</p>
<p>Uniform security staff can be clearly identified by their dark cargo-style pants, red shirt (York University colour) and black exterior body armour (usually bulletproof vest covers).</p>
<p>Residence watch staff are also posted nightly at all undergraduate residence buildings to provide an extra level of protection.</p>
<p>As part of the campus safety system a student escort service is available to all members of the community.
The escort staff are students hired on a part-time basis.
In an emergency escort staff have immediate communication with Security Services.</p>
<p>In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus.</p>

<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|300px|Anti-racism presentation held in the York Student Centre</a></p>
<p>A tradition of activist politics on campus has resulted in vocal demonstrations, particularly concerning issues relating to the <a>Middle East</a> and economic <a>globalization</a>.
There have been criticisms of both activist groups by the administration and media, for disrupting classes and provoking confrontations between students, and of the university administration for its response to demonstrators and activists, including expulsion and alleged police misconduct against activists.</p>
<p>As well, a controversy arose in 2005 regarding the sale of university land for a nearby townhouse development, and whether the developer, Tribute Communities, paid the full market price for the land.
York University maintained that it was the best overall proposal.
An independent investigation conducted by retired judge Edward Saunders verified that there had been no misconduct.</p>
<p>In October 2005, Professor <a>David F. Noble</a>, in opposition to York's practice of cancelling classes on the Jewish <a>High Holidays</a>, which originated in 1974 in deference to the university's large proportion of Jewish students and faculty members at that time, applied to the university's senate body for review of the policy.
Upon the York senate's affirmation of the policy, he pledged that he would teach on those days anyway, but later decided instead to poll students in his courses, asking if they wished future classes to be cancelled out of respect for other religious holidays.</p>
<p>On March 31, 2006, in the case of <a>Freeman-Maloy v. Marsden</a>, the <a>Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> ruled that the university and its president, <a>Lorna Marsden</a>, could be sued by plaintiff Daniel Freeman-Maloy for &quot;misfeasance in public office.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>University

and Mail</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the organizers accused the York administration, mainly the then Dean of the Osgoode Hall Law School and the Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation, of putting undue pressure on the organizers in order to force them to change the content of the conference, invite or disinvite some speakers.
The accusations&lt;ref&gt;<a>Accusations by conference organizers</a>&lt;/ref&gt; were supported by documents and emails that were obtained through the Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Act.
</p>
<p>The York administration appointed former Supreme Court of Canada Judge to review the issue, but the Iacobucci Review was problematic, and the terms of reference&lt;ref&gt;<a>Terms of Reference of Iacobucci review</a>&lt;/ref&gt; for the review were seen as an attack on academic freedom.
The whole issue is being investigated by the Canadian Association of University Teachers.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Canadian

<p>In response to the allegations made, a University spokesperson said that the University should be judged the fact that event took place despite the pressure not to hold it, and that there is always internal discussion as part of the planning of all events.
He added that &quot;In the end, this conference did go on and we do not feel that academic freedom was breached.&quot;&lt;ref

<h3>Alleged discrimination against pro-Israel groups</h3>
<h4>2009</h4>
<p>On February 11, 2009, approximately 100 pro-Palestinian students reportedly initiated a near-riot against a group of Jewish students during a news conference where speakers called for the impeachment of the York Federation of Students (YFS) executive.
According to witnesses, the demonstrators, which reportedly consisted of members of the YFS and Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), shouted &#x201c;Zionism equals racism!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Racists off campus!&#x201d;
One witness stated that &#x201c;a riot broke out.
They [YFS supporters] started banging the door and windows, intimidating Jewish students and screaming antisemitic slurs.&#x201d;
The students barricaded themselves inside the Hillel offices, where protesters reportedly banged on the windows and attempted to force their way in.
Eventually police were called to escort Jewish students through the protesters.

<p>In May 2009, York adjudicator <a>Janet Mosher</a>, who is an associate dean at York&#x2019;s Osgoode Hall Law School, ruled that two York students, Krisna Saravanamuttu and Jesse Zimmerman, had violated the Student Code of Conduct due to their behaviour at the protest, which she described as &#x201c;exclusionary and offensive&#x201d; and which promoted an atmosphere of &#x201c;hostility, incivility and intimidation.&#x201d;
Mosher noted that both students participated in the protest which pursued a group of Jewish students to Hillel&#x2019;s lounge in York&#x2019;s Student Centre, and swarmed outside shouting taunts.
On a video of the incident, Saravanamuttu was shown clapping and apparently leading a chant of &#x201c;Whose campus?
Our campus!&#x201d; as well as  participating in a chant of &#x201c;Racists off campus.&quot;
Saravanamuttu was fined $150 and both he and Zimmerman were given an official reprimand and human rights training.

The University replied that the event could only proceed under certain conditions (which ultimately led to the event's cancellation when the organizers declined to comply with the terms):</p>
<ul>
  <li>the organizers would be required to pay for security, including both campus and Toronto police;</li>
  <li>the organizers must provide an advance list of all program attendees and advance minute-by-minute summaries of all the speeches; and</li>
  <li>No advertising for the program would be permitted on campus.&lt;ref

</ul>
<p>These conditions drew criticism because they were not imposed on the organizers of <a>Israel Apartheid Week</a> which was being held on campus the same month.
In response, Rob Kilfoyle, director of security at York, told the Jewish Tribune that it insisted on the more stringent requirements on pro-Israel groups &#x201c;due to the participation of individuals who they claim invite the animus of anti-Israel campus agitators.&#x201d;
When asked why similar demands were not made of the organizers of Israel Apartheid Week events, Kilfoyle stated that even though the organizers of those events will not be paying for their own security, university personnel will be present &#x201c;to monitor the activities.&#x201d;

<p><strong>Criticism</strong>&lt;br /&gt; York's decision drew sharp criticism from <a>David Frum</a> who wrote in the <em><a>National Post</a></em> that &quot;Since the anti-Israel people might use violence, the speech of the pro-Israel people must be limited.
On the other hand, since the pro-Israel people do not use violence, the speech of the anti-Israel people can proceed without restraint.&quot;
A York University spokesman subsequently told Frum that &quot;all student groups that request university space&quot; must meet &quot;precisely same requirements&quot; but that while the &#x201c;process&#x201d; and the &#x201c;protocols&#x201d; that were the same, a &#x201c;needs-based assessment&#x201d; of each particular case is necessary.
Frum subsequently criticized the &quot;utterly arbitrary ad hoc decision-making of a fathomlessly cowardly university administration.&quot;
Frank Dimant, CEO of <a>B'nai Brith Canada</a> also sharply criticized York's justification, arguing that &quot;York&#x2019;s continued appeasement of anti-Israel agitators at the expense of Zionist Christians and Jews is unacceptable.&#x201d;

<p>Professor <a>Ed Morgan</a> of the <a>University of Toronto</a> criticized York, citing a 1992 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down a county government's increased fee for police protection for a controversial speaker because &quot;speech cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can be punished or banned, simply because it might offend a hostile mob.&quot;
Regarding the situation at York, Morgan wrote that &quot;It's bad enough that there are &quot;hostile mobs&quot; on our campuses; making others pay for that hostility only rubs salt in our wounded freedoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Free

Prof.
Howard C. Tenenbaum, also of the <a>University of Toronto</a>, wrote that York &quot;has lost all stature as an academic institution whose remit is to provide for full academic discourse, freedom from hatred on campus and freedom of speech, unless of course that freedom only includes unabashed hatred for the State of Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>RE:
Free speech versus safety at York University</a> by Howard C. Tenenbaum, National Post, March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
David Murrell of the <a>University of New Brunswick</a> wrote that &quot;Everyone has a supposed right to free speech at York University &#x2013; so long as groups can afford to pay security against leftist intimidation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Not
sending any more grads to York University</a> by David Murrell, National Post, March 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Response from York</strong>&lt;br /&gt; In a letter to the editor in the National Post, Patrick J. Monahan, York University's Provost and VP Academic, denied that Pro-Israel groups were subject to more stringent conditions and that &quot;the procedures applied in this instance were precisely the same as those applied to any event involving high profile and controversial speakers...
In this case, it was determined &#x2013; in consultation with the host student group... that added security would be necessary.&quot;
Consequently, <a>Christians United for Israel (CUFI)</a> agreed to hire two Toronto Police officers and two additional York Security, and that the cost of Toronto Police Services is always paid by the group that requires their attendance.
Monahan further stated that CUFI initially agreed to cover the cost but subsequently stated that its sponsors had refused to provide any funds for security.
The university then proposed several changes to the event and that &quot;the decision not to proceed was CUFI's alone.&quot;
Monahan further rejected Frum's allegations that Pro-Israel groups were treated unfairly, and argued that &quot;the university applied a fair procedure designed to provide and maintain a safe environment balanced against what a university must provide in the terms of debate, free speech and hard-held views.&quot;&lt;ref

responds to Frum column on free speech at York</a> by Patrick Monahan, (posted on Ylife) March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Response from Organizers</strong>&lt;br /&gt; Michael Mostyn, the National Director of public affairs for B'nai Brith Canada responded by suggesting that Monahan was being disengenious  in his letter.
Mostyn wrote that on the morning the &quot;Imagine with Us&quot; event was support to occur, the organizers were effectively given an ultimatum from the University that unless they provided funds for York security and regular police officers, the event would have to be cancelled.
When the students stated that they would not provide these funds, the university then reiterated that the event would be cancelled.
Thus, Mostyn argued that &quot;The cancellation, therefore, was a de-facto decision by York University, not the students.&quot;&lt;ref
name=Mostyn1&gt;<a>Wrong approach for 'free speech'</a> by Michael Mostyn, National Post, March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Mostyn criticized York University for its handling of the situation, pointing out that while Imagine with Us was considered a security risk due to anti-Israel protesters, Israeli Apartheid Week was not because similar disruptions were not expected from Pro-Israel groups.
Mostyn further argued that: &quot;There should be no attempt to frame this debate as one of freedom of speech on campus.
If anything, York has shut down free speech on campus, not enhanced it.&quot;&lt;ref
