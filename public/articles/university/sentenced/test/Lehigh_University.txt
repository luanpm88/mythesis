<h3>Wrestling</h3>
<p>The most storied athletic program at Lehigh is its wrestling team.
Over the past several decades it has turned out several All-Americans and had numerous squads finish with Top 20 NCAA national rankings.
Under coach Greg Strobel, recent teams have dominated the <a>EIWA</a> league.
On April 15, 2008, the athletic department announced the hiring of former assistant coach and two-time national champion <a>Pat Santoro</a> as Lehigh's next head coach.</p>
<h3>&quot;The Rivalry&quot;</h3>
<p> Lehigh University is notable for its rivalry in sports and academics with nearby <a>Lafayette College</a>.
Since 1884, the two football teams have met 146 times, making <a>&quot;The Rivalry&quot;</a> the most played in the history of college football.
It is also the longest uninterrupted rivalry in college football, with the teams playing at least once every year since 1897.
The Rivalry is considered one of the best in all of college athletics and <a>ESPNU</a> recently ranked The Rivalry #8 in their Top Ten College Football Rivalries.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Asa Packer.jpg|right|thumb|215px|[[Asa
Packer]]]]  <a>Asa Packer</a> named his university 'Lehigh' after his other passion, <a>the railroad</a>, despite suggestions from some to call it 'Packer University'.
It was founded to provide a well-rounded education for young men, combining a <a>liberal</a> and <a>scientific</a> education with the technical skills necessary to increase the prosperity of the region.
According to <a>William Bacon Stevens</a>, the first president of the board of trustees, Asa Packer's founding gift of $500,000 was the largest single endowment for a literary institution at that time.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>From 1871 to 1891, Packer's endowment allowed the institution to offer its education free of charge by competitive exam.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus its blend of engineering and liberal arts, attracted some of the nation's brightest students, many of whom went on to distinguished careers in industry and engineering.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering schools of the day, Lehigh was envisioned as a university instead of an &quot;institute of technology,&quot; offering an education that was rooted in both scientific and classical traditions as espoused by <a>John Amos Comenius</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; Initially there were five schools: four scientific (civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgy, and analytical chemistry) and one of general literature.
Over time, additional areas of the arts and sciences were added and engineering curricula were both merged and expanded.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|130px|Lehigh's seal</a> The stock market crash accompanying the <a>Panic of 1893</a> was a major financial blow to the university, since its endowment was largely invested in stocks, particularly shares of <a>Lehigh Valley Railroad</a> donated by the founder.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; As a consequence, Lehigh decided to drop its <a>Episcopal Church</a> affiliation in 1897, allowing it to qualify for state and federal government aid.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of Lehigh engineers who went into industry&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;&gt;Plotnicki, Rita M., <em>Looking Back: A Lehigh Scrapbook,</em> Lehigh University, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; a College of Business &amp; Economics was added in 1910.
Lehigh's business curriculum was unique&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt; in that it combined both the abstract emphasis on Economics seen in the <a>Ivy League</a> with the practical skills of management seen in more common business administration degrees given by other universities.</p>
<p>A similar emphasis on the well-rounded graduate can be seen in Lehigh's approach to education degrees.
Lehigh's respected School of Education started as (and remains) a solely graduate-level program.
This is based&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt; on the principle that you need to learn primary subject matter well before you can learn how to teach it to others.
Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five year program earning both a Bachelors Degree in a specialized field and a Masters Degree in Education.</p>

<h3>The Clery Act</h3>
<p> On April 5, 1986, 19-year-old Lehigh freshman Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in her dorm room and the culprit was later sentenced to death.
It was later disclosed that between 1982 to 1985 there had been 38 violent crimes at the university.&lt;ref&gt;<a>After
Their Daughter Is Murdered at College, Her Grieving Parents Mount a Crusade for Campus Safety</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The victim's parents then settled a civil suit out of court with the university for an undisclosed amount.
The backlash of unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.
The Clery Act requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Complying

<h2>Greek life</h2>

<h2>Spirit and traditions</h2>
<p>Lehigh students have several lasting traditions: Lehigh's school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper of the same name was first published in 1894.</p>
<p>Following the death of Asa Packer in May 1879, the University established &quot;Founder's Day&quot; to be held in October  to remember and recognize those have contributed to the success of the University.
The event remains an annual tradition.</p>
<p>Freshmen are traditionally inducted into the University in a convocation in the <a>Zoellner Arts Center</a> and welcomed at a Freshman-Alumni Rally where their class flag is given to them by the class from fifty years before.</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, freshmen wore small brown hats with their class numbers called &quot;dinks&quot; from the beginning of the fall semester until the Lafayette football game.
The week leading up to the big game was full of festivities created to unite the students and fuel spirit.
In one of these events, &quot;The Pajama Parade,&quot; the freshmen were led across the penny toll bridge in their pajamas singing &quot;We Pay No Tolls Tonight&quot; to the <a>Moravian College</a> dormitories where they would serenade the women.
The week before the game still involves decoration of the Greek houses, a bonfire, parties, rallies and the Marching 97 performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.</p>
<p>While the riots to rip down the goal posts in Taylor Stadium are a thing of the past, many alumni return for the Lafayette game (which is usually sold out three months in advance) to root Lehigh on, to attend parties at their former fraternities and sororities, and to see old friends.&lt;ref
