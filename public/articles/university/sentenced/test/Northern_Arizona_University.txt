<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|150px|left|Old Main, site of Northern Arizona Normal School; currently houses an art gallery, museum, and offices</a> Old Main, site of Northern Arizona Normal School; currently houses an art gallery, museum, and offices Initially named the Northern Arizona Normal School, the institution was formed on September 11, 1899.
The first graduating class, in 1901, consisted of four women who received credentials to teach in the Arizona Territory.
In 1925, the Arizona State Legislature allowed the school, which was now called the Northern Arizona State Teacher's College, to grant the Bachelor of Education degree.
The school became Northern Arizona State Teacher's College.</p>
<p>In 1929, the name was changed to Arizona State Teacher's College of Flagstaff.
The Great Depression took a toll on Flagstaff, but the college, which was able to provide more than 400 jobs for students, saw enrollment rise.
This time period also saw other types of growth at the college; a master&#x2019;s education degree became available in 1937.
</p>
<p>Enrollment dropped sharply, however, as World War II dawned.
ASTC became a Navy V-12 training site, and an aircraft spotting post was maintained by the Campus Civilian Defense Program.</p>
<p>In 1945 the name was changed to Arizona State College of Flagstaff, as the college now awarded degrees outside of the education realm.
The forestry program, created in 1958, marked the beginning of the college&#x2019;s journey to becoming a university.
In 1966, the Arizona Board of Regents recommended the name be changed to the current incarnation, Northern Arizona University.
NAU was granted the authority to bestow doctoral degrees in 1968, and the first doctoral candidates graduated in 1973.</p>
