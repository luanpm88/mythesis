<p><strong>Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC)</strong> is a <a>coeducational</a> <a>college</a> specializing in <a>agriculture</a>, located in <a>Tifton, Georgia</a>.
It is a part of the <a>University System of Georgia</a> and is named for <a>Abraham Baldwin</a>, the first <a>president</a> of the <a>University of Georgia</a>, <a>Georgia</a>'s first <a>university</a>.</p>
<p>Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College was established in 1908 as the <strong>Second District A&amp;M School</strong>, became <strong>South Georgia A&amp;M College</strong> in 1924 and <strong>Georgia State College for Men</strong> in 1929.
Named for a signer of the <a>United States Constitution</a> and the first president of the University of Georgia, the college assumed its present name in 1933 when it became a unit of the University System of Georgia.
At that time ABAC embarked on a mission devoted primarily to associate-level studies in agriculture, home economics, and related fields.
ABAC's role later expanded to include a diverse educational program including offering four-year degrees.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The Division of Agriculture and Forest Resources is the largest division on campus, and nursing is ABAC's largest single program major.
The college offers 40 college transfer programs in which students move on to four-year colleges and universities after their ABAC careers are complete.
Students can also choose from 15 two-year career technological degrees which take them into the job market.
Another option is the certificate program, where ABAC offers 19 selections, each of which can be completed in one year.</p>
<p>The Golf Turf Management program at ABAC is one of the most notable degree programs.
It is respected throughout the golf industry and offers students the opportunity to both study theory and put their knowledge into practice at the learning facility owned by Forest Lakes Golf Club.</p>
<p>ABAC's Nursing program is one of the best in the state.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>There are many student organizations on campus, many of them focused on agriculture.
In addition, ABAC has a variety of athletics for students, with a very strong men's tennis team headed by Alan Kramer.
The college's literary magazine, <em>The Pegasus</em>, has garnered wide acclaim across the state.
The college's paper, <em>The Stallion</em>, has won many awards among Georgia's two-year college newspapers.
The college has a radio station, WPLH, an Honors program, and the Arts Connection which helps bring arts and cultural events to Tift and surrounding counties.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>For a two-year school, the grounds of the college are exceptionally well maintained.
They are used by the teaching staff as an open-air classroom due to the amount of plant materials and conditioning of the facility.
Former alumnus Brad Barbee is the current groundskeeper and sports field manager.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>Many ABAC students live on campus in the ABAC Place apartments, the largest housing project of its kind at a two-year college in America.
The apartment-style housing, as opposed to the traditional on campus dorms which were demolished starting in 2004, is notable because it is managed by the Student Life and Housing Office rather than a third-party management company.
The ABAC Lakeside facility is the newest, offering suite-style rooms to freshmen.
Additionally, ABAC has completed construction of the Welcome Center, which serves as a nexus for guests to the campus, as well as a nerve center for the campus.</p>
<h2>Four-year curriculum</h2>
<p>The college recently changed sectors from two-year to state college, making it an institution that can offer two-year and four-year programs.
Four-year programs include a bachelor's degree in Rural Studies.</p>
