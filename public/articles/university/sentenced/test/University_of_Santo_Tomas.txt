<p>The <strong>Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines</strong> (colloquially <strong>UST</strong> or &quot;Ust&#x00ea;&quot;. <a>Filipino</a>: <strong>Unibersidad ng Santo Tomas</strong>), is a private <a>Roman Catholic</a> university run by the <a>Order of Preachers</a> in <a>Manila</a>.
Founded on April 28, 1611 by archbishop Miguel de Benavides, it has the oldest <a>extant</a> university charter in the <a>Philippines</a> and in <a>Asia</a>.
and is one of the world's largest Catholic universities in terms of enrollment found on one campus.
UST is also the largest university in the city of <a>Manila</a>.
As a <a>Pontifical University</a> in Asia, UST is the only university to have been visited by two popes three times: once by <a>Pope Paul VI</a> on Nov. 28, 1970, and twice by <a>Pope John Paul II</a> on Feb. 18, 1981 and January 13, 1995.</p>
<p>The University is composed of several autonomous faculties, colleges, schools and institutes, each conferring undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees, and the basic education units.
Several degrees have been <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Commission on Higher Education</a> as Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development.</p>
<p>The Patron of the University is <a>St.
Thomas Aquinas</a>, while <a>St.
Catherine of Alexandria</a> is the Patroness.
</p>
<p>Prominent <a>Thomasians</a> include <a>saint</a>s, Philippine <a>president</a>s, <a>hero</a>es, artists, scientists, professionals and religious figures, who have figured prominently in the <a>history of the Philippines</a>.
The athletic teams are the <a>Growling Tigers</a>, members of the <a>University Athletic Association of the Philippines</a> and are consistent winners of the <a>Overall Championship</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>  The foundation of the University is ascribed to <a>Miguel de Benavides</a>&lt;!--
The University library uses Benavides, obviously, with a letter S. --&gt;, O.P., the third Archbishop of Manila.
He came to the Philippines with the first <a>Dominican</a> mission in 1587.
He went on to become bishop of Nueva Segovia, and was promoted archbishop of Manila in 1601.
Upon his death in July 1605, Benevides bequeathed his library and personal property worth 1,500 pesos to be used as the seed fund for the establishment of an institution of higher learning.
Fr.
Bernardo de Santa Catalina carried out Benavides&#x2019; wishes and was able to secure a building near the Dominican church and convent in <a>Intramuros</a> for the College.</p>
<p>In 1609, permission to open the College was requested from King <a>Philip III of Spain</a>, which only reached Manila in 1611.
On April 28, 1611, notary Juan Illian witnessed the signing of the act of foundation by Baltazar Fort, OP, Bernardo Navarro, OP, and Francisco Minayo, OP.
Fort, appointed that year to the post of Father Provincial, was its first Rector.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Colegio de Nuestra Se&#x00f1;ora del Sant&#x00ed;simo Rosario</strong> was established on April 28, 1611, from the Benavides's library.
Later renamed <strong>Colegio de Santo Tom&#x00e1;s</strong>, it was elevated by <a>Pope Innocent X</a> to a university on November 20, 1645 in his brief, <em>In Supreminenti</em>.
This made the university the second royal and pontifical institution in the Philippines, after the Jesuit's Universidad de San Ignacio which was founded in 1590 but closed in the 1768 following the expulsion of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its complete name is <strong>The Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines</strong> ().
It was given the title &quot;Royal&quot; by King <a>Charles III of Spain</a> on 1785; &quot;<a>Pontifical</a>&quot; by <a>Pope Leo XIII</a> on 1902 in his constitution, <em>Quae Mari Sinico,</em> and the appellative &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot; by <a>Pope Pius XII</a> on 1947.</p>
<p>The university was located within the walled city of <a>Intramuros</a> in <a>Manila</a>.
It was started by the Spanish <a>Archbishop of Manila</a> in the early 17th century as a <a>seminary</a> for aspiring young priests, taking its name and inspiration from Saint <a>Thomas Aquinas</a>, a Dominican theologian.
The first courses offered by the Colegio de Santo Tom&#x00e1;s were canon law, theology, philosophy, logic, grammar, the arts, and civil law.
In 1871, it began offering degrees in Medicine and Pharmacy, the first in colonized Asia.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1611, the University's academic life was interrupted only twice: from 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, and from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the country.
In its long history, the university has been under the leadership of more than 90 Rectors.
UST's first Filipino rector was Fr.
Leonardo Legaspi, O.P. who served UST from 1971-1977.
Its current rector is Fr.
Rolando V. de la Rosa, O.P.</p>
<h2>The University seal</h2>
<p>The seal of the University of Santo Tomas is a shield quartered by the Dominican Cross.
Superimposed on the cross is the sun of <a>Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>, patron of Catholic schools, after whom the university is named.
The sun is actually made similar to the <a>Sun of May</a>.
Encircling the Dominican cross are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the upper left is the <a>papal tiara</a>, indicating that the UST is a <a>pontifical university</a>.</li>
<li>The upper right shows the lion derived from the <a>seal of Spain</a>, indicative of royal patronage throughout the greater part of the university's centuries-old existence.</li>
<li>The lower left is occupied by the sea lion taken from the seal of the City of Manila, the national capital, symbolizing the Republic of the Philippines.</li>
<li>The rose on the lower right is a symbol of the <a>Blessed Virgin Mary</a> under whose patronage the university was placed from its very beginnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The symbols are rendered in gold (except for the Dominican cross which is black and white), and are set on a field of light blue, the Marian color.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tongues of Fire</strong> is the official logo for the Quadricentennial celebration of the university.
This logo features the outline of the UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university.
From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out <strong>U</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, and <strong>T</strong>.
The tongues of fire reference the future of the university, some ideals, and are reminiscent of the stripes of the Tiger, the school's mascot.
The Quadricentennial logo was designed by Dopy Doplon, a Thomasian.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|University of Santo Tomas in Espa&#x00f1;a, Manila</a> The University sits on an almost perfect square of 21.5 hectares bounded by <a>Espa&#x00f1;a Boulevard</a>, P.Noval, A.H. Lacson and Dapitan St, in <a>Sampaloc</a>, <a>Manila</a>.
The University transferred to its present campus in 1927 when the Dominicans deemed the <a>Intramuros</a> Campus Inadequate for the University's growing population.
The First Structures in the campus were the imposing Main Building, the Santisimo Rosario Parish, the UST Gym (once the largest gym in the country), and the <a>Arch of the Centuries</a>.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The Campus, at present boasts a mixture of old and new architecture with the inclusion of the UST Multi-Deck carpark which houses the <a>Alfredo M. Velayo College of Accountancy</a>, and the proposed UST Sports Complex, the 2nd Modern Sports facility to be constructed by a <a>UAAP</a> member school.
Other new structures include the Beato Angelico Building which houses the <a>College of Architecture</a> and <a>College of Fine Arts and Design</a>, the Plaza Mayor, the UST Quadricentennial Square and Alumni Park, Thomas Aquinas Research Complex and the UST - Tan Yan Kee Student Center.
<a>right|thumb|250px|UST Quadricentennial Square</a> The University has started to develop upcoming campuses in <a>Santa Rosa City</a> (60 hectares), <a>General Santos City</a> (80 hectares), and <a>Negombo</a>, <a>Sri Lanka</a>, (5 hectares).
The University is also in the process of establishing a presence in Mongolia.
In 2011, the University will be celebrating its 400th founding anniversary, and it is projected that the new campuses will be operational by then.

[[Arch of the Centuries]]]]--&gt; Aside from the basic and major subjects, all undergraduate students are required to take 15 units (tuition-free) of <a>Theology</a> classes.
The students are also required to attend 4 physical education classes, and a choice from among ROTC, civil welfare training service, and literacy training service.</p>
<h3>Basic education</h3>
<p>The <strong><a>UST Elementary School</a></strong> used to offer primary education for children in the <a>K-12</a> levels, but before the Quadricentennial Celebration of the University, the school started denying applications from the K-Level, until the last batch of Grade 6 students who would graduate on AY 2010-2011 are left.
The UST Elementary School, after finishing the last batch of its students in the UST Sampaloc Campus, will be transferred to the new UST Campus in <a>Santa Rosa City</a>, <a>Laguna</a>.</p>
<p>UST has two secondary institutions: The <strong><a>UST High School</a></strong> and the <strong><a>UST Education High School</a></strong> which serves as a laboratory for the College of Education.</p>
<p>All students of these institutions undergo Citizenship Advancement Training, while the students from first to third year level of the <a>UST High School</a> undergo scouting under the <a>Boy Scouts of the Philippines</a> for the boys and the <a>Girl Scouts of the Philippines</a> for the girls.
The scouting program aims to instill nationalism and discipline among the students while the Citizenship Advancement Training aims to introduce students to the National Service Training Program that college students undergo.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate studies</h3>
<p>&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Main Building (UST).jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Main
Building (University of Santo Tomas)|UST Main building]] Fa&#x00e7;ade]] --&gt; The different faculties, colleges and institutes of the University were created at different times in the University's history.
The &quot;Faculties&quot; were founded before the American occupation of the early 20th century, while the &quot;Colleges&quot; were founded during and after American rule.
The &quot;Institutes&quot;  and &quot;Departments&quot; are found within their mother faculties/colleges.
Some Institutes that attained enough enrollment were separated from their mother faculties/colleges and were made into colleges in their own right.</p>
<h4>Faculties</h4>
<p>The degree programs for undergraduate studies were first offered in 1611, where the <strong>Faculties of Sacred Theology and Philosophy</strong> were founded.
The <strong>Faculty of Canon Law</strong> was founded in 1733.

Graduates of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery rank among the top scorers in the medical licensure exams, and the Faculty boasts a high passing rate overall.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Faculty adopted the <a>problem-based learning</a> method for use in the curriculum.
This was highly controversial, as many professors complained that students were not learning the basic sciences adequately.
Eventually, in 2003 the curriculum was changed again, this time to an innovate format which combined elements of both traditional (lecture-based) and problem-based methods.</p>
<p>The Faculty is known for giving its fourth-year students a series of written and oral exams known as the &quot;revalida&quot;.
In the oral exams, groups of three students each are questioned by panels composed of three professors on basic, clinical, and emergency medical sciences.
Passing the revalida is a prerequisite to graduation.</p>
<p>The Faculty is a Center of Excellence.
It has been consistently producing topnotchers in the annual national licensure exams for Filipino physicians and it is proud of its Level 4 National Accreditation for several years.
It is also the <a>alma mater</a> of numerous Secretaries of Health of the Philippines, as well as several Presidents of the Philippine Medical Association, the national organization of medical doctors in the country.
The Faculty was also ranked as the only Asian medical school to be in the top 10 list of foreign medical institutions by the U.S. Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in 2007.</p>
<h4>Graduate School</h4>
<p>As early as the 17th century postgraduate degrees were offered and granted by the various faculties in the University.
In 1938, the <strong><a>UST Graduate School</a></strong> was established to administer and coordinate all the graduate programs in the University.
The Graduate School academic programs have grown to 90 course offerings, spanning about seven clusters of disciplines.
Today the UST Graduate School is recognized as a Center of Excellence in several fields of the Arts and Humanities, Allied Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Engineering by the Commission on Higher Education.
Its programs in business, public management, and education were also recognized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Fund for Assistance of Private Education (FAPE)- Evaluation of Graduate Education Programs (EGEP).</p>
