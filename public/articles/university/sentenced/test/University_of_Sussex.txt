Good University Guide</a>, <em>The Times</em>, accessed 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2010 <em>Guardian</em> university rankings, Sussex has Britain's best chemistry department.
In 2010 the University of Sussex was ranked 156th in the World by <a>QS World University Rankings</a>&lt;ref name=&quot;topuniversities.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Sussex is also a founder member of the <a>1994 Group</a> of research-intensive universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Arts Building on the University of Sussex campus.</a>
The <em>University of Sussex</em> initially began as an idea for the construction of a university to serve <a>Brighton</a>.
In December 1911 there was a public meeting at the <a>Royal Pavilion</a> in order to discover ways in which to fund the construction of a university.
However, the project was halted by the <a>First World War</a> and the money raised was instead used for books for the <a>Municipal Technical College</a>.
However, the idea was revived in the 1950s, and in June 1958, the government approved the corporation's scheme for a university at <a>Brighton</a>, the first of a new generation of <a>red brick universities</a> which came to be known as <a>plate glass universities</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;history &quot;/&gt; The University was established as a company in 1959, with a <a>Royal Charter</a> being granted on 16 August 1961.&lt;ref
name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The University's organisation broke new ground in seeing the campus divided into Schools of Study, with students able to benefit from a multidisciplinary teaching environment.</p>
<p>Sussex quickly came to be identified with postwar social change and developed a reputation for <a>radicalism</a> which it retains.
In 1973, a crowd of 500 students forcibly prevented United States government adviser Samuel Huntington from giving a speech on campus due to his involvement in the <a>Vietnam War</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.thebadgeronline.co.uk/news/huntingtondie</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004 the University started to use a new logo in place of its traditional <a>coat of arms</a>, as part of a wider new 'visual identity'.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Falmer House, home to the Students' Union.</a>
<a>thumb|left|Arts A lecture theatres in 2005.</a>
The campus, designed by Sir <a>Basil Spence</a>, is located in the village of <a>Falmer</a>, next to its railway station, and accessed by car from the <a>A27 road</a>.
It is situated next to the <a>Sussex Downs</a>, which influenced <a>Sir</a> <a>Basil Spence</a>'s design of the campus.</p>
<p>Sir Basil Spence's designs were appreciated in the architecture community, with many of the buildings on the University's campus winning awards.
The <a>gatehouse</a>-inspired Falmer House won a <a>bronze medal</a> from the <a>Royal Institute of British Architects</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Another campus building, The Meeting House, won the <a>Civic Trust</a> award in 1969.&lt;ref
name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the buildings which made up the core of Sir <a>Basil Spence</a>'s designs were given <a>listed building</a> status, with Falmer House being one of only two buildings to be given a Grade 1 status of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;About&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Sussex claimed to be &#x201c;the only English university located entirely within a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&#x201d;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;South Downs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the <a>South Downs National Park</a> replaced the <a>Sussex Downs AONB</a> in March 2010, most of the campus was excluded from the park.</p>
<p>The Gardner Arts Centre, another of Basil Spence's designs, was opened in 1969 as the first university campus arts centre.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It had a 480 seat purpose built theatre, a visual art gallery and studio space and was regularly used for theatre and dance as well as showing a range of films on a modern cinema screen.
The Centre closed in the summer of 2007:&lt;ref name=&quot;Closure&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; withdrawal of funding and the cost of renovating the building were given as the key reasons.</p>
<p>Plans have been put forward to the local council to refurbish the centre, with work starting as soon as mid 2009.
It is hoped the centre will be open in 2011-2012, in time for the University's 50th anniversary celebrations.</p>
<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>
<p>The university was founded with the unusual structure of &quot;Schools of Study&quot; (ubiquitously abbreviated to &quot;schools&quot;) rather than traditional university departments within arts and science faculties.
The Schools were intended to promote high-quality teaching and research.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the University promoted the system by claiming, &quot;Clusters of faculty [come] together within schools to pursue new areas of intellectual enquiry.
The schools also foster broader intellectual links.
<em>Physics with Management Studies, Science and Engineering with European Studies, Economics with Mathematics</em> all reach beyond conventional Arts/Science divisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The
University of Sussex (1990, 1991).
<em>The University of Sussex Undergraduate Prospectus 1991</em> &lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the original schools had been developed somewhat and were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>African and Asian Studies <em>(abbreviated to AFRAS)</em></li>
  <li>Biological Sciences <em>(BIOLS)</em></li>
  <li>Chemistry and Molecular Sciences <em>(MOLS)</em></li>
  <li>Cognitive and Computing Sciences <em>(COGS)</em></li>
  <li>Cultural and Community Studies <em>(CCS)</em></li>
  <li>Engineering and Applied Sciences <em>(ENGG)</em></li>
  <li>English and American Studies <em>(ENGAM or EAM)</em></li>
  <li>European Studies <em>(EURO)</em></li>
  <li>Mathematical and Physical Sciences <em>(MAPS)</em></li>
  <li>Social Sciences <em>(SOC)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2001, as the university was celebrating its 40th anniversary, the then Vice Chancellor Alasdair Smith proposed &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; major changes to the curriculum across the 'Arts schools', and structural changes were agreed by the senate which would create two Arts schools and a &quot;Sussex Institute&quot; in place of the five schools then in place.
Corresponding changes would be made in Sciences.</p>
<p>The changes were finally implemented in September 2003.
After discussion in senate and the schools, the university adopted for the first time in its history the concept of a department.
All subjects were located firmly in one school, and undergraduates were offered straightforward degree subjects rather than the distinctive Sussex differentiation based on the context provided by school courses.</p>
<p>The new schools were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Humanities <em>(HUMS)</em></li>
  <li>Life Sciences <em>(LIFESCI)</em></li>
  <li>Science and Technology <em>(SCITECH)</em></li>
  <li>Social Sciences and Cultural Studies <em>(SOCCUL)</em></li>
  <li>Sussex Institute <em>(SI)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2009 the university adopted a new organisational structure.
The term &quot;Schools of Studies&quot; was retained, but each was headed by a &quot;Head of School&quot; rather than the traditional &quot;Dean&quot;.
Many of these new heads were appointed from outside Sussex rather than from existing faculty.
The schools as of 2009 are listed below.&lt;ref
name=&quot;schools&quot; &gt;  &lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;department&quot; has been retained in some cases, where a school contains separate disciplines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineering and Design</li>
  <li>Informatics</li>
  <li>Life Sciences (Includes: Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry and houses the Centre for Genome Damage and Stability)</li>
  <li>Mathematical and Physical Sciences (Includes: Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy)</li>
  <li>Psychology</li>
  <li>Business, Management and Economics</li>
  <li>Education and Social Work</li>
  <li>Global Studies (Includes: Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Anthropology Goes Global&quot;</a>, <em>Sussex Anthropologist</em> (newsletter), 1:1, Autumn 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Geography and International Relations, as well as interdisciplinary programmes in Development Studies)</li>
  <li>Law, Politics and Sociology</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>History, Art History and Philosophy</li>
  <li>Media, Film and Music</li>
</ul>
<p>The changes did not affect the <a>Brighton and Sussex Medical School</a> (BSMS).</p>
<h3>Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors</h3>
<p>The current and fifth <a>Chancellor</a> of the university is <a>Sanjeev Bhaskar</a>, who succeeded <a>Lord Attenborough</a> in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;<a>New
Chancellor Announced</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<ol>
  <li><a>Viscount Monckton of Brenchley</a> (1961&#x2013;65)</li>

  <li><a>Professor Michael Farthing</a> (2007&#x2013;Present)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Financial crises and protests</h3>
<p>In 2009, despite an annual turnover of &#x00a3;160 million, the University announced that it had to make cuts of &#x00a3;3 million in the current academic year and &#x00a3;5 million in 2010-11 due to reductions in government funding.
The proposal for the cuts includes 115 compulsory redundancies, including a third of the academics in the School of Life Sciences, 13 academics in Informatics, and more redundancies in the schools of Engineering, History, English and the Centre for Continuing Education.
The plans also include reductions in funding and reorganising of many of the university's non-academic services, including severe cuts to student advice services, sexual health clinic UNISEX, and the on-campus nursery and creche.
The necessity of the cuts have been widely criticised, particularly while they run parallel to the University's &#x00a3;100m investment plan for new academic and residential campus buildings.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/22may09/article6.shtml</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The announced cuts have resulted in multiple protest actions.
On 18 March 2010, the <a>University and College Union</a> (UCU) staged a one-day staff strike, urging management to consider alternative cost-cutting proposals,&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8574448.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt; as well as separate protests by parents displeased with the proposed closure of the University's nursery and cr&#x00e8;che facilities.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4498</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The UCU planned further industrial action on 19 and 21 June 2010, but cancelled these actions citing &quot;significant progress&quot; in reaching negotiated settlement for the voluntary departure of staff.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4701</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Alongside the UCU action, the student body formed a &quot;Stop The Cuts&quot; activism movement, which supported the official UCU strike action with picket lines and vocal peaceful protests outside management buildings, as well as sit-in protests of campus facilities.
On 3 March 2010, citing &quot;management's refusal to consider alternative proposals put by the UCU, student advisors, and the cr&#x00e8;che&quot; a group of approximately 50 students from the Stop The Cuts movement barricaded themselves inside the University's main administrative building after breaking in through a fire exit.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.thebadgeronline.co.uk/news/university-calls-police-on-students-who-protest-outside-sussex-house-against-university-cuts/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The students staged a peaceful occupational protest which resulted in a police presence being called onto the campus over security concerns.
The protest ended uneventfully after several hours, though two students were arrested and later released over assault on a security guard and a police officer, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8548529.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
Six students were later suspended from the University over the protest, though reinstated after paying fines.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8556772.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://defendsussex.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/outcome-of-student-disciplinary-hearing.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A group of approximately 500 Sussex students were involved in the <a>Fund Our Future: Stop Education Cuts</a> London demonstration on 10th November 2010, which was organised to protest the government's rise of the tuition fee cap.
The University of Sussex's Students Union subsequently issued a statement refusing to condemn the use of violence by a minority of students who occupied the Conservative Party Headquarters during the protest, claiming it was &quot;a drop in the ocean compared to the true violence and vandalism [by the government]&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-11739527</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The occupation resulted in dozens of injuries (including three police officers) and criminal damage to the building, including smashed windows and spraypaint graffiti.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>[[Image:accommodation.jpg|thumb|300px|Accommodation as seen from the [[Sussex Downs]] behind Park Village in 2007.
Clockwise from the top left: Brighthelm (barely visible), East Slope (furthest), Park Village (closest, showing new pitched roofs).
The construction of new buildings can be seen to the right of the recently modified East Slope car park.]]</p>
<p>The early campus included five &quot;Park Houses&quot; (Essex, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich, and York, named after other 1960s universities) and Park Village.
The &quot;houses&quot;, of which all but Kent House were based on a courtyard design, featured several long corridors with kitchens and bathrooms at the end and a social space on the ground floor, very much in the manner of a traditional hall of residence.
(Essex House was reallocated in the late 1990s as postgraduate teaching space.)
Park Village, by contrast, consists of individual houses with four bedrooms per floor, a kitchen on both the bottom and the top floor, and bathroom facilities on the middle floor.
The houses are arranged in &quot;streets&quot; with a social centre building including porters' office, pigeon-holes for post, and a bar, towards the campus end of the area.
Essex House also featured a self-contained flat (external but attached by a walkway) which was given over to the <a>Nightline</a> confidential listening and advice service in 1992.
Kent House includes the Kulukundis House wing, developed with easy access for residents with special needs.</p>
<p>Accommodation on campus was expanded in the 1970s with the construction of the unusual split-level flats of <a>East Slope</a>.
This development also has a social building with a porters' office and bar.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, as student numbers rose, further developments were constructed in the corner of campus between East Slope and Park Village.
Brighthelm and Lewes Court were constructed in public-private partnership funding arrangements with the <em>Bradford &amp; Northern</em> and <em>Kelsey</em> Housing Associations.
During construction and their first year of use they were named after these associations; students were involved in suggesting the permanent names Brighthelm and Lewes Court.
The name &quot;Brighthelm&quot; owes its <a>etymology</a> to part of the former name of Brighton, Brighthelmstone, whilst Lewes Court is named after the nearby <a>county town</a> of <a>Lewes</a>, to some extent in keeping with Sussex and Falmer Houses elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p>In total there are seven areas of student accommodation on campus.
The two newest accommodation areas were completed recently: one next to <a>Falmer train station</a>, named Stanmer Court, and the other next to East Slope, opposite Bramber House, known as Swanborough.&lt;ref
name=&quot;accommodation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In October 2009 it was announced that new accommodation is to be built on the field north of Lewes Court.
The new residences will contain 744 study-bedrooms, 12 family flats and 21 studio flats.
Building work began in January 2010, with completion in time for the academic year 2011-12.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/09Oct09/article1.shtml</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Sport</h3>
<p>The University competes in the following sports:</p>
