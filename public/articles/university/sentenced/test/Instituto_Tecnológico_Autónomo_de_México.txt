<h2>History</h2>
<p>ITAM was founded as the <em>Instituto Tecnol&#x00f3;gico de M&#x00e9;xico (ITM)</em>, on March 29, 1946 under the aegis of the Mexican Association of Culture (<em>Asociaci&#x00f3;n Mexicana de Cultura</em>).
A group of wealthy individuals with interests in banking, industry and commerce, led by Don <a>Ra&#x00fa;l Baill&#x00e8;res</a>, created the institution with the goal of using higher education as a promoter of economic and industrial change in Mexico.</p>
<p>It was originally an <a>Economics School</a> and one year later it opened its undergraduate <a>Business School</a>.
Due to the opening of the <a>Accounting School</a>, the institute grew from 52 students in 1947 to 500 in 1951.
In 1963, by government decree, the ITAM was recognized as a &#x201c;Free University School&#x201d; and became autonomous (hence its name).
However the inclusion of the word autonomous in its name was not recognized by the government until 1985.</p>
<p>During the 1970&#x2019;s new programs were added including <a>Applied Mathematics</a> (1974), <a>Social Science</a> (1975) and a <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (1974).
In the 80&#x2019;s and 90&#x2019;s the additions were: <a>Law</a> (1980), <a>Actuarial Science</a>(1982), <a>Computer Science</a> (1983), <a>Political Science</a> (1991, instead of Social Science), <a>International Relations</a> (1992), <a>Telematics</a> (1993) and <a>Industrial Engineering</a> (1997).
During the last decade the academic offer was increased by the establishment of <a>Business Engineering</a> (2004), <a>Financial Management</a> and <a>Mechatronics</a> (2010).</p>
<h2>Campi</h2>
<p>During its first four years the ITAM was originally located in a house in <a>Mexico City</a>'s <em><a>centro</a></em> in 518 La Palma street.
In 1950 the institute moved to 65 Serapio Rend&#x00f3;n street in the Colonia San Rafael.
During the late 50&#x2019;s it moved once more to a new building built specially for the institute at the corner of Marina Nacional street and Lago Zirahuen street in the Colonia An&#x00e1;huac.
Finally, in 1978, ITAM moved to its current campus in 1 R&#x00ed;o Hondo, in <a>San &#x00c1;ngel</a>.
In 1991 the smaller graduate school campus, in 939 Camino Santa Teresa, was opened.</p>
