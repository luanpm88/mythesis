In 1968, the College became independent from the <a>Catholic Church</a>, and coeducational in 1971.
Recently, the university has experienced a large increase in on-campus housing, student enrollment, new facilities, and the establishment of both the Wegmans School of Nursing, and The Wegmans School of Pharmacy.
In 2008, the New York State budget provided St. John Fisher College with a $2 million grant to explore the feasibility of opening a law school in downtown Rochester.</p>

</ul>
<p>The school offers undergraduate degrees (BA or BS depending on content area) in Adolescence Education (7-12), Adolescence Education/Special Education (7-12), Childhood Education(1-6), and Childhood Education/Special Education (1-6).

Mr. Wilson and his family have been long-time supporters of St. John Fisher College.</p>
<h3>Bittner School of Business</h3>
<p>The Bittner School of Business prepares professionally competent and ethically responsible graduates for careers as managers and professionals primarily for local and regional business.
The school emphasizes excellence in teaching, close interaction with students, and recognizes that excellent teaching is informed by faculty actively engaged in research and scholarship.

<p>The Bittner <a>MBA</a> Programs are designed for individuals with passion and focus.
Individuals who know where they want to go, and can&#x2019;t wait to get there.
The Bittner School of Business offers two MBA programs, the One-Year MBA and the Flexible MBA.
</p>
<p>Both programs examine real life problems that business executives grapple with on a daily basis, so that students are able to develop informed, creative, strategic and integrated perspectives necessary to take on a lifetime of leadership challenges.</p>
<p>Building on a strong liberal arts foundation, College&#x2019;s accounting/finance/MIS and management/marketing departments have provided our students with a comprehensive and well-rounded education in their respective areas of specialization since the very beginning&#x2019;s of the institution&#x2019;s history.</p>
<p>A significant milestone in the history of Fisher&#x2019;s business programs has been their accreditation by <a>The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a> (&quot;<a>AACSB International</a>&quot;) which is recognized as the hallmark of excellence in management education.
At the time this accreditation was gained, all business programs at the College were brought together in 2003 to form St. John Fisher College&#x2019;s first professional school which was named the Bittner School of Business.</p>
<p>Fisher has also added a lot of supplemental graduate degrees that apply nicely to the Business majors.
