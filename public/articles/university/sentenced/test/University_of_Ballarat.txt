<p>The <strong>University of Ballarat</strong> is a dual-sector <a>university</a> in <a>Ballarat</a>, <a>Victoria</a>, <a>Australia</a>.
It was formed by the passage of an Act of the <a>Victorian Parliament</a> in 1994, from the <strong>Ballarat College of Advanced Education</strong>.
It subsequently merged with the <em>Ballarat School of Mines and Industries</em> (1870) and the Horsham based <em>Wimmera Institute of TAFE</em> in 1998 to create a larger University.</p>
<p>According to the university's records as of 2008, there were 25,810 students consisting of 13,820 higher education students and 11,990 <a>Technical and Further Education</a> students.
The report states that 11,460 students are at the Ballarat campus, but does not differentiate between higher education students and <a>Technical and Further Education</a> students.
In terms of higher degrees, there were 6,145 masters students, which is more numerous than the 6,048 bachelor students.
In terms of students who are not located on a campus of the university, there were 12,481 students with partnership institutions such as the <a>Melbourne Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

Lydiard Street, Ballarat CBD]] </p>
<p>The University of Ballarat has a long history that goes back to the famous gold rush era of the 1850s.
Tertiary education at Ballarat began with the establishment of the School of Mines and Industries in 1870 making it Australia's third oldest tertiary institution.
It is for this reason that the 1870 Founders Hall at the University of Ballarat came into existence.
</p>
<p>People such as <a>Redmond Barry</a> who also founded the State Library of Victoria were involved in the original establishment to create an institution of equivalent standing to a university to offer degree level courses at Ballarat.</p>
<p>The School of Mines had two divisions - a tertiary division and a technical division.
The tertiary division provided higher education courses such as mining engineering, geology, education and business studies, while the technical division provided technical programs such as wool classing, plumbing and bricklaying.</p>
<p>The organisation remained in that form until the 1960s when it was split into two institutions.
The School of Mines remained intact offering technical and secondary level programs, while the tertiary division became Ballarat Institute of Advanced Education.
In the 1970s it was renamed Ballarat College of Advanced Education.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s the <a>Dawkins Revolution</a> had arrived and Ballarat CAE was in trouble in terms of losing its long historical identity.
In an era where larger metropolitan colleges were opting for mergers with existing universities, such as <a>Chisholm Institute of Technology</a> with <a>Monash University</a>, <a>Melbourne College of Advanced Education</a> with <a>Melbourne University</a>, <a>Philip Institute of Technology</a> with <a>RMIT University</a>, <a>Lincoln Institute of Health Science</a> and <a>Bendigo College of Advanced Education</a> with <a>La Trobe University</a>, and <a>Victoria College</a> and <a>Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education</a> with Geelong's <a>Deakin University</a>, Ballarat was faced with the prospects of merging with Deakin University, an option the board of Ballarat CAE did not want to accept arguing in the words of the then director Professor John Sharpham who publicly declared that &quot;Deakin is not strong&quot; and who attempted to arrange a merger of &quot;equal sides&quot; where Ballarat CAE, Warrnambool IAE, and Deakin would merge to become the <a>University of Western Victoria</a>.
Under this arrangement, Ballarat would get 50% of voting power, with Geelong and Warrnambool the other 50%.
</p>
<p>The proposal was rejected by Deakin, which left Ballarat alone as the remaining college in Victoria not to become a university.
Then along came the University of Melbourne which allowed Ballarat CAE to become an affiliated college of the University.
The name of Ballarat CAE was changed to &quot;<em>Ballarat University College, an affiliated College of the University of Melbourne</em>&quot; which are the actual words put on graduates' testamurs.
At this point it seemed that BUC was heading to become the Ballarat campus of Melbourne University which would have given it a sizable rural campus in Western Victoria.
However, this did not eventuate with some critics suggesting that it was too prestigious.</p>
<p>Ballarat University College then pursued the push to become a fully-fledged university in its own right.
This began when Professor John Sharpham asked the board of BUC, that if <a>Southern Cross University</a> is allowed to divorce the <a>University of New England</a> by becoming a university in its own right, then Ballarat should be allowed to do the same.
This led to lobbying efforts to the Federal Government which responded by sending three Vice-Chancellors (incidentally one from University of New England) from Australian Universities to Ballarat to consider whether Ballarat could become a university in its own right.
The result was favorable and the university college became a university in 1994 without any links to Melbourne University except that Melbourne would observe the academic standards at the new university for a five-year period.
</p>
<p>Upon creation of the university, the announcement by the Foundation Chancellor Professor <a>Geoffrey Blainey</a> of the inaugural Vice-Chancellor of University of Ballarat proved controversial with Professor Sharpham being overlooked in favour of Professor David James (incidentally Deakin University's Deputy Vice-Chancellor!).</p>
