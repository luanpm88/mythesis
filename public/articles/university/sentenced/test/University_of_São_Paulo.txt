<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:Faculdade de Direito da USP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S&#x00e3;o Paulo|Law School of USP]].]]
During the &quot;search for alternatives&quot; period in the 1930s, political centralization and the first attempt to provide Brazil with modern administrative, military and educational institutions took place.
The main initiatives included the University of S&#x00e3;o Paulo, which was created in 1934.
Its nucleus was the creation of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, with professors coming from <a>France</a>, <a>Italy</a>, <a>Spain</a>, <a>Germany</a> and other European countries.
</p>
<p>USP also brought together several research and higher-education institutions in the state created before, such as the Faculty of Medicine (Faculdade de Medicina), the <a>Polytechnic School</a> (Escola Polit&#x00e9;cnica), and the <a>College of Law</a> (Faculdade de Direito).
The Polytechnic School includes <a>civil</a>, <a>electrical</a>, <a>mechanical</a>, <a>mining</a>, <a>metallurgical</a>, <a>naval</a> and <a>oceanic</a>, and <a>chemical engineering</a> departments.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>

Students are admitted by an entrance exam, known as the <a>vestibular</a> (<a>FUVEST</a>), consisting of two steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Part I:</strong> composed of 90 multiple-choice questions on <a>Portuguese</a>, English, <a>Chemistry</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Physics</a>, <a>Geography</a>, <a>History</a> and <a>Biology</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Part II:</strong> those who achieve the &quot;cut-off&quot; score during the first stage for their chosen course are classified for the second stage.
The &quot;cut-off&quot; grade varies from year to year, because it depends on the performance of the candidates and the number of available places in each course.
The number of candidates summoned for the second stage is three times the number of available places in the chosen career.
Those who score 22 points or less are automatically disqualified.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the second phase of Fuvest, there are three days of discursive tests.
On the first day there are tests of Portuguese and Writing for all applicants.
The subjects on the second day are: History, Chemistry, Geography, Biology, Physics and Mathematics.
On the third day the test are given according to the chosen career, the students take discursive tests of History, Chemistry, Geography, Biology, Physics, or Mathematics.
Careers in Music, Arts, Audiovisual, Sports, Architecture and Design have tests of specific skills and abilities.</p>
<p>Moreover, candidates who only attended a public high-school receive an extra 12% on their final Part I and Part II scores, arguably, in order to compensate for the general low quality of Brazilian public basic education.</p>
<p>USP's entrance exam is prepared and administered by FUVEST (University Foundation for Vestibular), subject to regulations approved by the university's Undergraduate Studies Council.
In 2006, 142,656 students signed up for Fuvest's vestibular to apply for admission to the University of S&#x00e3;o Paulo.
There were 10,202 openings.
One of the most competitive courses was <a>Journalism</a>, with about 45 applicants per opening.
In order to pass to Part II, the most difficult course (Medicine) required a grade of 83%.
USP is a free university, and students do not have to pay any tuition fees.</p>
<h2>Academic career</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Teaching Assistant (Auxiliar de Ensino) - MS-2 (must have a Master's degree and be enrolled in a doctoral program).
Undergraduate students can also be teaching assistant for a semester, with scholarship from each department.</li>
<li>Professor Doctor (Professor Doutor) - MS-3 (must have a doctoral or equivalent degree)</li>
  <li>Associate Professor (Professor Associado) - MS-5 (must have a <em>Livre Docente</em> title; equivalent to the German <a>Habilitation</a>)</li>
  <li>Full Professor (Professor Titular) - MS-6 (top rank, only MS-6 professors are allowed to hold positions such as Dean of a Faculty/School or Rector of the University)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Race and ancestries</h2>

<p>Brazilian Universities are generally considered elitist, excluding the poor and the non-White through economic selection.
Due to this concern, USP conducted a survey in 2001, called &quot;Censo &#x00e9;tnico-racial&quot;, among its students, to assess to what point such problems where prevalent.
It found that 76.9% of the students reported to be White, 12.8% Yellow (East Asian), 7.0% &quot;pardo&quot;, 1.2% Black, 0.4% Amerindian, and 1.7% did not answer the question.
This can be compared with the general population of the Metropolitan Region of S&#x00e3;o Paulo, in the same year of 2001, which was 65.33% White, 1.84% Yellow (East Asian), 26.88% &quot;parda&quot;, 5.83% Black, and 0.12% Amerindian, showing indeed a high level of overrepresentation of Whites and Yellows, corresponding to an equivalent underrepresentation of Blacks and &quot;pardos&quot;.
This disproportion reflects the huge racial disparities in Brazil, between Whites (and &quot;Yellows&quot;) on one hand, and non-Whites on the other.</p>
<p>98.5% of the students were Brazilian born, 0.5% naturalized Brazilians and 1% foreigners.
92.7% of the students hold only a Brazilian citizenship and 7.3% hold a <a>dual-citizenship</a> (56.7% Italian citizenship, 9.3% Portuguese, 8.5% Spanish, 6% German, 4.2% Japanese and 4% American).</p>
<p>Asked if they are &quot;descendants of foreign immigrants&quot;, 81% of the students reported &quot;yes&quot;, which reflects the composition of the middle class in <a>State of S&#x00e3;o Paulo</a>, which is mostly composed of descendants of 19th and 20th centuries immigrants who went to Brazil.
The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%),
Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (5.6%),
Brazilian (4.3%), African (2.8%), Arab (2.4%) and Jewish (1.2%).</em></p>
