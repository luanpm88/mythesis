<strong>U de M</strong>, transl.
<em>University of Moncton</em>) is a <a>French language</a> university located in <a>Moncton</a>, <a>New Brunswick</a> serving the <a>Acadian</a> community of <a>Atlantic Canada</a>.
It is the only francophone university in New Brunswick and is one of only two such universities in the <a>Maritimes</a>, the other being the <a>Universit&#x00e9; Sainte-Anne</a> in <a>Pointe-de-l'&#x00c9;glise</a>, <a>Nova Scotia</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on 19 June 1963, the modern Universit&#x00e9; de Moncton is the result of the merger of three colleges: <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Saint-Joseph</a> (<a>Memramcook</a>, 1864), <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge du Sacr&#x00e9;-Coeur</a> (Bathurst, 1999), and <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Saint-Louis</a> (<a>Edmundston</a>, 1946).
In 1989, the Universit&#x00e9; of Moncton founded undergraduate degrees in <a>adult education</a>.
<a>Alan Beddoe</a> designed the university coats of arms.</p>
<p>The <a>National Film Board of Canada</a> documentary <code>Acadia Acadia ?!?</code> (1971) directed by Michel Brault documents how the Universit&#x00e9; de Moncton became the setting in the late 1960s for the awakening of Acadian nationalism.

<h3>Faculty of Law</h3>
<p>The <a>University of Moncton's Faculty of Law</a> is one of only three French-language common law schools in Canada.
(The <a>University of Ottawa</a> and <a>McGill University</a> also offer common law degrees in French.)
The school was founded in 1978 in order to respond to the needs of francophone communities outside of Quebec.
As Quebec practices civil law, there was a need to instruct francophone lawyers in common law to practice in other parts of Canada.
The University of Ottawa law school teaches both common and civil law, as does McGill; thus the University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is the only exclusively French, exclusively common law school in Canada.
</p>
<p>U de M offers both the basic <a>LLB</a> and the graduate <a>LLM</a>.
The school also offers joint degrees: the LLB-<a>MBA</a> (Masters of Business) and LLB-<a>MEE</a> (Masters of Environmental Studies).
As well, students who already possess a civil law degree (an <a>LLL</a> or a <a>BCL</a>) from a Canadian school can enroll at the University of Moncton for two semesters to complete an LLB.</p>
<h3>Faculty of Medicine</h3>
<p>The <a>Univerty of Moncton's Faculty of Medicine</a> is the first such francophone school in the <a>Maritimes</a>, outside the province of <a>Quebec</a>.</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>There are six libraries and resource centers across the three campuses: <a>Biblioth&#x00e8;que Champlain</a> (Moncton), <a>Biblioth&#x00e8;que Michel-Bastarache</a> (Moncton), <a>Centre d'&#x00e9;tudes acadiennes</a> (Moncton), <a>Centre de ressources p&#x00e9;dagogiques</a> (Moncton), <a>Biblioth&#x00e8;que Rh&#x00e9;a-Larose</a> (Edmundston) and <a>Biblioth&#x00e8;que Shippagan</a>.
All records from these libraries are gathered into one catalogue: Catalogue &#x00c9;lo&#x00ef;ze.</p>
<p>Two of these libraries, Michel-Bastarache and Centre de ressources p&#x00e9;dagogiques, are special libraries, catering to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education, respectively.
The Centre d'&#x00e9;tudes acadiennes, found on the lower level of Biblioth&#x00e8;que Champlain, is a world-renown and primary resource and archive center for <a>Acadian studies</a>.</p>
