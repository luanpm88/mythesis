<p>The <strong>Moss Landing Marine Laboratories</strong> (MLML) is a multi-campus marine research consortium headquarted at <a>Moss Landing, California</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Moss Landing Marine Laboratories is part of the <a>California State University</a>, administered by <a>San Jose State University (SJSU)</a>, and located in <a>Moss Landing, California</a>.
The main building is located at 8272 Moss Landing Road, .
It was established in 1966.
At the midpoint of the coast of <a>Monterey Bay</a>, it is only a few hundred meters from <a>Monterey Canyon</a>, the largest <a>undersea canyon</a> on the west coast of the Americas.
As a result, researchers are able to reach areas with depths greater than 1000 meters in less than an hour by boat from the facility.</p>
<p>The facility is a <a>sea grant college</a>, which offers a <a>Master's of Science</a> degree in <a>marine sciences</a> through the seven universities that make up the consortium, as well as offering graduate and undergraduate marine science courses to the students of the campuses.</p>
<p>The seven members of  the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories consortium are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>California State University, East Bay</a></li>
  <li><a>California State University, Fresno</a></li>
  <li><a>California State University, Monterey Bay</a></li>
  <li><a>California State University, Sacramento</a></li>
  <li><a>San Francisco State University</a></li>
  <li><a>San Jose State University</a></li>
  <li><a>California State University, Stanislaus</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories also collaborate with scientists at other institutions in analysis of marine chemistry and marine species.
One frequent partner for such collaboration is the <a>Marine Mammal Center</a>.</p>
<h3>Research vessels</h3>
<p>MLML operates a fleet of three <a>research vessel</a>s, the  R/V <em>Point Sur</em>, the  R/V <em>John H. Martin</em>, and the  R/V <em>Sheila B</em>.</p>
<h3>Sea Grant</h3>
<p>Moss Landing Marine Laboratories participates in the <a>Sea Grant Colleges</a> program by hosting an office of the UC Sea Grant Extension Program, affiliated with <a>University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>The Submersible Capable of Under Ice Navigation and Imaging was a <a>National Science Foundation</a> funded research project for robotic under the sea ice for <a>surveying and exploration in Antarctica</a> from 2007 through 2009.</p>
