<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>300px|left|A view of Utah Valley University's campus.</a>
--&gt;UVU was founded in the fall of 1941, when the Utah State Vocational Office consolidated federal work program classes into one campus in <a>Provo</a>.
At this time, the school was known as the Central Utah Vocational School.
Growth brought numerous changes to UVU over the following decades, and the school was renamed several times to reflect its changing role.
In 1963, the name was changed from Central Utah Vocational School to Utah Trade Technical Institute.
In 1967, the school became Utah Technical College at Provo, and was given the authority to confer associate degrees for the first time.
In 1977, the institution began moving to its present location beside the <a>I-15</a> in Orem.
In 1987, it became Utah Valley Community College.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1993 that the school was named Utah Valley State College and began awarding four-year degrees.
The Utah legislature approved renaming it as a university in February 2007 (effective July 1, 2008), allowing it to begin offering master's degrees, although the school continues to place particular emphasis on its two- and four-year degree programs.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2008, the institution was awarded university status and changed its name to Utah Valley University to reflect the shift.</p>
<p>UVU is Utah's second-largest public university, and the largest employer in Orem with over 1,400 full-time faculty and staff, and over 3,200 part-time faculty and staff.</p>
<p>When it was a community college, the school had approximately 8,000 students enrolled, and now has over 28,000 students, growing by approximately 3,000 students a year.
Currently there are 32,670 students enrolled for Fall semester 2010 at UVU.</p>

In December 2006, the UVU School of Business received accreditation from the <a>AACSB</a>.</p>
<p>UVU is an <a>open enrollment</a> university and despite the University's size and growth it looks as though administration will keep enrollment open for the time being.</p>
<p>About 88% of UVU students come from Utah but an increasing number of students are coming from different countries and states.
In 2009, UVU students represented all 50 states and 67 countries.

UVU President William A. Sederburg hired Cooper, Roberts, Simonsen and Associates and Layton Construction as the design/build team for the new Digital Learning Center, with acclaimed New York architect Jacob Alspector as lead architect.
&#x201c;We chose the design we&#x2019;re going with because it was an exceptional design that still kept a lot of the same features of our current campus.
So it looks like it&#x2019;s supposed to be there yet it stands out,&#x201d; said Jim Michaelis, associate vice president of Facilities Planning.
The $48 million project includes networked computers, computer labs, a computer reference area (Information Commons), media center, 31 study rooms, and wireless internet throughout the building.</p>
