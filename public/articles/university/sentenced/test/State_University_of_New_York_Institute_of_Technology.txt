Established by the SUNY Board of Trustees on June 14, 1966, SUNYIT is the State of New York's public institute of technology.
SUNYIT is accredited by the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
A $225-million-dollar partnership between SUNYIT and <a>State University of New York at Albany</a>'s College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering was announced in 2009; construction projects on the SUNYIT campus totaling $100 million are underway.
</p>

SUNYIT students come from all over New York, many other states, and more than 20 other nations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally a graduate and upper-division institution, the college offered classes in temporary locations and at extension sites for several years until the first buildings were constructed on the permanent Marcy, New York campus in the 1980s.
In 2002, the SUNY Board of Trustees approved a mission change, enabling SUNYIT to offer lower-division programs in professional, technological, and applied studies.
In fall 2003, SUNYIT admitted its first class of freshmen, becoming a full, four-year institution.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The developed campus occupies more than 400 acres, with major buildings surrounding by trees and green landscape.
The &quot;west campus&quot; property of more than 300 acres is reserved for the development of the Marcy NanoCenter at SUNYIT.</p>
<p>The campus&#x2019;s current two residential complexes &#x2013; Mohawk and Adirondack Halls &#x2013; offer the privacy and convenience of apartments, with students sharing suites in townhouse-style buildings.
A third complex, Oriskany Residence Hall, is under construction and will be ready for occupancy by the entering freshman class in fall 2011.
Other major campus improvements underway are a $13 million student center and a $20 million field house, both to be completed and occupied in 2011, and a $127.5 million technology complex that will be completed in 2012-2013.</p>
