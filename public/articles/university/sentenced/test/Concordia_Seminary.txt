<p>  <img> <strong>Concordia Seminary</strong> is located in <a>Clayton, Missouri</a>, an inner-ring suburb on the western border of <a>St.
Louis, Missouri</a>.
The institution's primary mission is to train <a>pastor</a>s, <a>deacon</a>esses, <a>missionaries</a>, <a>chaplains</a>, and <a>church</a> leaders for the <a>Lutheran Church&#x2013;Missouri Synod</a> (LCMS).
The current president of the seminary is the Rev. Dr. Dale Meyer.</p>
<p>Concordia Seminary is the second oldest <a>Lutheran</a> seminary (<a>Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg</a>, established in 1826, being the oldest), and one of the largest Seminaries in the United States.
Founded in 1839, the seminary initially resided in <a>Perry County, Missouri</a>.
In 1849 it was moved to St. Louis, and in 1926 the current campus was built.
Concordia shares the duty of clerical training for the LCMS with <a>Concordia Theological Seminary</a> in <a>Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>.</p>
<p>The St. Louis institution was at one time considered the &quot;theoretical&quot; (<em>i.e.</em>, academic) seminary of the LCMS while Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne was considered the &quot;practical&quot; seminary, although those distinctions are no longer widely recognized.
Concordia Seminary currently offers a <a>Master of Divinity</a> degree leading to ordination, as well as <a>Master of Arts</a>, <a>Master of Sacred Theology</a>, <a>Doctor of Ministry</a>, and <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> degrees.
The seminary is considered theologically conservative, as it does not train women for ordination, and also promotes <a>historical-grammatical</a> and <a>reader response criticism</a> interpretation of the <a>Bible</a>.
It is an accredited member of the <a>Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada</a> and the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<p>The radio station <a>KFUO-AM 850</a> has its studios and transmitter tower on the campus; for many years the nationally-broadcast <em><a>Lutheran Hour</a></em> originated from this LCMS radio station.</p>
<h2>The Chapel of St. Timothy and St. Titus</h2>
<p>Dedicated on November 15, 1992, the Chapel of St. Timothy and St. Titus serves as the house of worship for the Concordia Seminary community.
Aside from the primary worship space the chapel building also contains a choir practice room, one classroom, the dean of chapel's office, the housefellow's quarters, and a chapel that is used primarily for small worship services and for worship practice.

<h2>Concordia Seminary Library</h2>
<p>Concordia Seminary Library has the capacity to house 250,000 volumes and to seat over 300 people, providing study space for divinity students and carrels for graduate students and scholars.
The book collection numbers over 245,000 volumes.
Included are the personal libraries of many of the founding fathers of the <a>Lutheran Church&#x2013;Missouri Synod</a> and its theologians like <a>C.
F. W. Walther</a>.</p>
<h2>Luther statue</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|Luther Statue</a> Located next to Founder's Hall, the Luther Statue was originally dedicated at the former site of Concordia Seminary on Jefferson Avenue in St. Louis in 1903.
In 1926, when the present campus was dedicated in Clayton, the statue was relocated to the new campus site.
The statue is an exact replica of one that exists in <a>Worms, Germany</a>.
The statue in Germany is located where <a>Martin Luther</a> made his famous speech, &quot;Here I Stand&quot;, at the <a>Diet of Worms</a>.</p>

<h2>Luther Tower</h2>
<p>Luther Tower designed by architect <a>Charles Klauder</a> and was completed in 1966.
At its base is a small chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Apostles and its crown contains a 49-bell <a>carillon</a>.
The bells are dedicated to the memory of all <a>Lutheran Church&#x2014;Missouri Synod</a> pastors.
The largest bell weighs 2.5 tons and the smallest weighs 17 pounds.</p>
<h2>Concordia Historical Institute</h2>
<p>The Concordia Historical Institute is the Department of Archives and History of the <a>Lutheran Church&#x2013;Missouri Synod</a>.
The Institute is located on the Concordia Seminary Campus.
The building includes a reference room for patrons, a conference room, two levels of museum exhibit space and two stack areas for storage of the collections.
The stack areas are maintained at a constant temperature and humidity to preserve the resources.
The Institute also maintains two historic sites in <a>Perry County, Missouri</a>, publishes the Concordia Historical Institute Quarterly, and assists districts and congregations of the <a>Synod</a> in preserving their historical records.</p>
<h3>Concordia Park</h3>
<p>Concordia Park is located in the DeMun Neighborhood on the grounds of Concordia Seminary.
The City of Clayton has leased this passive  park from Concordia Seminary since 1992.
With gentle rolling hills, open grassy areas, and a canopy of mature trees this park is a lovely place to enjoy nature while sitting at one of the benches or picnic tables provided for visitors.</p>
<h2>The Seminex controversy</h2>
<p>Concordia Seminary became a focus of national media attention in 1974 when 45 of its 50 faculty members, together with the vast majority of students, walked out to form a rival institution known as <a>Seminex</a>, or Concordia Seminary in Exile.
The Seminex walk-out protested the suspension of the seminary's president, <a>John Tietjen</a>, who faced charges from the conservative Synodical president, <a>Jacob Preus</a>, of allowing the teaching of false doctrine.
More specifically, the charges alleged that Tietjen had permitted the teaching of <a>historical-critical method</a>s of scriptural interpretation, rather than upon exegetical principles that consider scripture to be the inerrant word of God <em>(see <a>Biblical inerrancy</a>)</em>.
Seminex was never very successful, due mostly to its difficulties placing graduates in ministerial positions.
Seminex suffered a gradually declining enrollment over the course of the late 1970s.
The last St. Louis commencement was held in May 1983.
Seminex continued to exist as an educational institution on the LSTC campus in Chicago through the end of 1987.</p>
