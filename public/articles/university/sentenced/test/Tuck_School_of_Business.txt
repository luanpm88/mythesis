<p>The <strong>Amos Tuck School of Business Administration</strong> or the <strong>Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth</strong> as it is now called is the <a>graduate</a> <a>business school</a> of <a>Dartmouth College</a> in <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, United States of America.
Founded in 1900, Tuck is the oldest graduate school of business in the world, and was the first institution to offer <a>master's degree</a>s in the field of <a>business administration</a>.
It is one of six <a>Ivy League business schools</a>, and it is considered as one of the world's premier business schools that consistently ranks in the top five in many rankings.</p>
<p>Tuck grants only one degree, the <a>Master of Business Administration</a>, alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates, although there are opportunities for dual degrees with other institutions.
The school places a heavy emphasis on its tight-knit and residential character, and has a student population that hovers near 500 students and a full-time faculty of 46.
Tuck claims over 8,400 living <a>alumni</a> in a variety of fields, and currently enjoys the highest rate of alumni donation of any business school.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Amos tuck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amos
Tuck]], the namesake of the Tuck School]] At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president <a>William Jewett Tucker</a> decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world.
Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of <a>Edward Tuck</a>, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist.
Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of <a>preferred stock</a> shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school.
It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus <a>Amos Tuck</a>.</p>
<p>In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed to the modern <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA).
Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year.
Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building facing <a>the Green</a> at the center of the campus; in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall.
Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's eight academic and administrative buildings.
Tuck's isolated location has been described as an &quot;image problem&quot; for attracting successful applicants and faculty to its rural campus, although some students cite the school's relatively insular character as a positive trait for fostering intimacy and friendship.</p>
<p>Tuck has three residential facilities: Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000), Achtmeyer Hall (constructed 2008) and Pineau-Valencienne (constructed 2008).
The newer residence halls and Raether Hall are part of the Tuck Living and Learning Complex, which houses 85 additional students as well as classrooms and study space.
At a total cost of $27.2 million, the Tuck LLC is was completed in December 2008.
The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) with the adjacent <a>Thayer School of Engineering</a>.
The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.</p>
<p>Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) was renovated in 2009 to convert it from a student residence hall to a combined faculty research facility and executive residence.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>

<p>The Tuck School offers only a single degree: the two-year, full-time <a>Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA).
First-year MBA students at Tuck undertake a 32-week core curriculum in general management and a specialized First Year Project.
During their second year, students take 12 elective courses and design their own focused field of study.</p>
<p>The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for &quot;building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership.&quot;</p>

<p>Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of seven dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions.
Dual degrees include an MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from <a>The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</a> at <a>Tufts University</a>, an MBA/<a>Master of Public Affairs</a> from the <a>John F. Kennedy School of Government</a> at <a>Harvard University</a>, an MBA/Master of Studies in Environmental Law from the <a>Vermont Law School</a>, and an MBA/<a>Master of Arts</a> from the <a>Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies</a> at <a>Johns Hopkins University</a>.
Joint degrees include a <a>Doctor of Medicine</a>/MBA from <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>, a <a>Master of Public Health</a>/MBA from the Dartmouth's <a>Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences</a>, and a Master of Engineering Management/MBA from Dartmouth's <a>Thayer School of Engineering</a>.
The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the <a>Handelshochschule Leipzig</a> in Germany, the <a>HEC School of Management</a> and the <a>ESSEC Business School</a> in Paris, <a>IESE Business School</a> in Barcelona, and the <a>London Business School</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the MBA program, the school also offers an array of executive education and other non-degree programs, such as the Tuck Business Bridge Program for current and recent university undergraduates, and the Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program for high school students.
As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and <a>Board of Trustees</a>.
The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Paul Danos) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.</p>

<p>Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions.
Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven &quot;academic areas&quot;: <a>accounting</a>, <a>finance</a> and <a>economics</a>, <a>marketing</a>, <a>operations management</a> and <a>management science</a>, strategy and management, <a>international business</a>, and management communication.
Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration.
The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates.
The five research centers are the William F. Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership, the Center for Corporate Governance, the Center for International Business, the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, and the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies.
