<p>  <strong>William Greenleaf Eliot</strong> (August 5, 1811 &ndash; January 23, 1887) was an <a>American</a> educator, <a>Unitarian</a> minister, and civic leader in <a>Missouri</a>.
He is most notable for founding <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>, but also contributed to the founding of numerous other civic institutions, such as the <a>St.
Louis Art Museum</a>, public school system, and charitable institutions.</p>
<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<p>Eliot was born in <a>New Bedford, Massachusetts</a>.
After attending the Friends Academy in New Bedford, Eliot attended <a>Columbian College</a> (now the <a>George Washington University</a>) in <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, and graduated in 1831.
Eliot did graduate work at <a>Harvard Divinity School</a> and graduated in 1834.
He was ordained a minister of the Unitarian church on August 17, 1834.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>After his ordination, Eliot moved to <a>St.
Louis</a>, where he lived for the rest of his life, until 1887.
There he founded the Church of the Messiah, the first <a>Unitarian</a> church west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.
Today it is called the First Unitarian Church of Saint Louis.
He led the congregation from 1834 to 1870, through a period of rapid expansion of the city.
</p>
<p>Eliot was active in civic life, and instrumental in founding many civic institutions, including the <a>St.
Louis Public Schools</a>, the <a>St.
Louis Art Museum</a>, Mission Free School, South Side Day Nursery, and the Western Sanitary Commission to provide medical care and supplies during the <a>Civil War</a>.
In 1861 he was part of a small group of men who helped Generals <a>Nathaniel Lyon</a> and <a>Francis P. Blair</a> to retain <a>Missouri</a> in the Union.
He contributed to the development of the Colored Orphans' Home, Soldiers' Orphans' Home, Memorial Home, Blind Girls' Home, Women's Christian Home, and other charitable institutions.
When <a>Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> visited St. Louis, he had met Eliot and called him &quot;the Saint of the West.&quot;
</p>
<p>Eliot had a strong interest in developing educational opportunities in St. Louis.
He co-founded <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a> (initially called <a>Eliot Seminary</a> - much to his chagrin) in 1853.
He donated funds to its construction and served as its chancellor from 1870 to 1887.
In 1859 he founded Mary Institute, a school for girls which he named after his daughter, who died young.
It is now part of the co-educational <a>Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School</a>.
</p>

These ranged from works of <a>theology</a> in the Unitarian tradition to specific moral advice to young people.
