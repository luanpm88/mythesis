<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Alabama Baptist organization first expressed interest in establishing a Baptist college in Mobile in 1946.
At that time the organization was considering combining the already established schools of Howard College (Now <a>Samford University</a>) and <a>Judson College</a> and move the newly formed school to Mobile.
The proposal was unsuccessful, but the concept of establishing a Baptist affiliated school in the Mobile area persisted.

<p>In 1957 the <a>Alabama Baptist State Convention</a> was formally asked to study the possibility of establishing a <a>junior college</a> in Mobile.
In 1959 the convention agreed to the proposal if $1.5 million could be raised by the community.
A year later $2 million had been raised by local churches and businesses.
Sylacauga Baptist Church pastor William K. Weaver Jr. was elected as the founding president after serving on the convention's study committee.
The Alabama Baptist convention approved the establishment of Mobile College on November 14, <a>1961</a> and was granted state recognition less than a month later by  <a>Governor John Patterson</a>.</p>
<p>Mobile businessman Jay P. Altmeyer donated 200 <a>acres</a> in north Mobile as the site for the newly established college.
Ray Loper of Loper Lumber Company donated another  along the Chickasabogue Creek.
Other purchases brought the land total to .
Today the University campus encompasses .
</p>
<p>On February 13, 1998, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark Foley, former executive vice-president of the <a>New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary</a>, as president of the university.
Shortly after being appointed, Foley told board members that &quot;any operation related to the University of Mobile under my administration will operate in the black or it will not operate.&quot;
Two months later, the Nicaragua campus was sold to <a>Tom Monaghan</a>, founder of the <a>Domino's Pizza</a> chain, and was renamed the  <a>Ave Maria College of the Americas</a>.</p>
