<h2>History</h2>
<p>Julius Hartt and Moshe Paranov founded the Hartt  School in 1920.
Paranov married Hartt's daughter Pauline &quot;Dot&quot; or &quot;Dottie&quot;.
Both Moshe and Pauline Paranov were associated with the school for the rest of their lives.
Paranov was associate director of the Hartt School until 1932, when he became dean.
He became president of the school in 1957 after its affiliation with the University.
Pauline was the principal seamstress for many of the elaborate costumes used in Hartt productions.
Later she served as Dean.
After Pauline's death, Moshe married Elizabeth &quot;Libby&quot; Warner, a member of the Hartt faculty.
Elizabeth Warner Paranov organized her late husband's papers and donated them to the University.
Moshe Paranov was well known throughout Greater Hartord and contributed enormously to the musical life of the community.</p>
<p>Before the College was built on its present campus &quot;Julius Hartt, Moshe Paranov and Associated Teachers,&quot; as they were known, occupied a small school in another part of Hartford.
Moshe was instrumental in the growth of the Hartt school and was known for calling on major business persons requesting funding for his school.
(Alfred E. Fuller&#x2014;Fuller Brush Company&#x2014;was a major and constant contributor to his school.)</p>

<h2>Facilities</h2>
<h4>Alfred C Fuller Music Center</h4>
<p>For nearly four decades, the growth of The Hartt School was nurtured by the philanthropy of Alfred C. Fuller, founder of the famous Fuller Brush Company.
Support from the Fuller family enabled Hartt to build the Alfred C. Fuller Music Center, the four-story building that houses The Hartt School on the University of Hartford's main campus.
The Fuller Building is the primary home to classes and administrative offices as well as the Hartt Community Division (excluding dance).
The Fuller Music Center has two major performance spaces: Millard Auditorium and Berkman Recital Hall.
In the summer of 2008, Berkman Recital Hall, in the Fuller Music Center, underwent a complete renovation, turning a former recital hall/black box theater/dance rehearsal space into a dedicated 80-seat recital hall (although the hall is used for meetings, rehearsals, and other miscellaneous events).
Berkman has a direct recording studio connection to The Hartt Recording Studio, Green Room facilities/piano storage.</p>
