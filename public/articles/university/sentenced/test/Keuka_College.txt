<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Founder: George Harvey Ball&lt;br /&gt; Year: 1890</p>
<p>George Harvey Ball envisioned a college that would provide a high-level education to all deserving students, regardless of economic background.
As a brochure produced in 1891 attested: Keuka College was &#x201c;pre-eminently, for the common people&#x2026;With ample endowment,&#x201d; the brochure continued, &#x201c;it will raise an army of country people from comparative ignorance and consequent weakness to superior men and women who shall bring strength to the nation and help to humanity.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Financial troubles forced the College to close in 1915, and it was re-opened in 1921 as Keuka College for Women.
Keuka remained a single-sex institution until 1985, when financial troubles caused by declining enrollment (from 536 total students in 1979 to 407 students in 1984) again forced the issue and the Board of Trustees voted to admit men.</p>
<p>In 1942, Edith Estey, a 1933 Keuka graduate and administrator, created the Field Period program, which remains a major component of a Keuka College education.
Through Field Period, each Keuka student is required to spend 140 hours per year (or approximately one month) in a self-directed learning experience.
This can involve a work <a>internship</a>, a <a>community service</a> project, spiritual exploration, personal development (such as an <a>Outward Bound</a> experience), cross-cultural diversity exploration, or a group cultural experience to another city or country.</p>
