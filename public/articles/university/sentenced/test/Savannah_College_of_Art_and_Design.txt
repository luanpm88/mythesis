<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Poetter Hall, originally Preston Hall, was SCAD's first building and first historic restoration project.</a>
The college is engaged with the city of Savannah and the preservation of its architectural heritage.
By restoring buildings for use as college facilities, the college has been recognized by the <a>American Institute of Architects</a>, the <a>National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>, the <a>Historic Savannah Foundation</a> and the <a>Victorian Society of America</a>.
The college campus now consists of 67 buildings throughout the grid and park system of downtown Savannah.
Many buildings are located on the famous 21 squares of the old town, which are laden with monuments, <a>live oaks</a> and an undeniable Southern-Gothic feel that is sought by the many movies filmed there.</p>
<p>Located in <a>Atlanta</a>'s <a>Midtown</a>, SCAD Atlanta facilities provide classroom and exhibition space, well-equipped computer labs, library, photography darkrooms, printmaking and sculpture studios, a dining hall, fitness center, swimming pool and residence hall.

Originally named Preston Hall, the building was renamed Poetter Hall in honor of co-founders May and Paul Poetter.
SCAD soon expanded rapidly, acquiring buildings in Savannah's downtown <a>historic</a> and <a>Victorian</a> districts, restoring old and often derelict buildings that had exhausted their original functions.</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p>Most students live off-campus, outside the residence halls, as there are no formal campus grounds other than those contained by the building properties themselves.

The residence halls are Weston House, Dyson House, Oglethorpe House, Turner House, Turner Annex, Pulaski House, Forsyth House, Boundary Village, Alice House, The Terrace, and Barnard Village.
Other residence halls include ACA Residence Hall of SCAD and Spring House in Atlanta; the Hong Kong Gold Coast residencies in Hong Kong; and the Maison Pitot Complex in Lacoste, France.</p>
