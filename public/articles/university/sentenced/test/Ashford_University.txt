<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Mount Saint Clare, circa 1920.</a>
Ashford University traces its origins back to 1891, when Father James A. Murray invited the Sisters of St. Francis to help teach in Clinton, Iowa.
By 1893, the Sisters were able to purchase some land in Clinton, on which they established their mother house and the Mount St. Clare Academy, a boarding and day school for girls.
The Academy and the mother house quickly outgrew their old building.
In 1910, the mother house and the academy moved into the newly constructed Mount St. Clare building, which is still in use today.</p>
<p>Seeing a need for higher education in <a>Clinton County</a> and the surrounding area, the Sisters founded <strong>Mount St. Clare College</strong>, a liberal arts institution and the direct predecessor to Ashford University, in 1918.
At that time, the Mount St. Clare Academy, College, and Convent were all housed in the same building.
Mount St. Clare College was on the approved list of teacher education colleges in Iowa from 1932 to 1954 when the State raised the requirements.
In 1942, 60% of the rural teachers in Clinton County and 62% of the teachers in the city of Clinton school system had received all of their training from Mount St. Clare College.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>The 1950s and 1960s marked a period of expansion at the institution.
In 1950, the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> first accredited Mount St. Clare College.
Following the accreditation, the school quickly began to expand.
The sisters moved into an adjoining convent building in 1956.
A new library and gymnasium were opened a few years later.
During the sixties, Durham Residence Hall was opened as was the Science Building, which also houses the Children&#x2019;s Center.
In 1967, the college became coeducational.</p>
<p>For the 1979-1980 school year, the college received approval for its first four-year degree, a bachelor's program in business administration.
During the same year, Mount St. Clare Academy merged with St. Mary's High School in Clinton, forming Mater Dei High School (now know as <a>Prince of Peace Preparatory</a>).
With the space freed by the academy's merger, the school began to offer additional four year programs.
In 1997, the sisters moved off campus into their new mother house, The Canticle.
In 1998, the Durgin Educational Center was opened, which included new athletic facilities, including Kehl arena.</p>
<h3>Transition to university</h3>
<p>In 2002, Mount St. Clare College began to offer graduate courses over the internet.
In conjunction with the expanded course offerings, the school changed its name to <strong>The Franciscan University</strong>, and the name of the athletic teams was changed from &quot;The Mounties&quot; to &quot;The Saints.&quot;
In 2003, the university received approval to offer its first master&#x2019;s degree online.
In September 2004, the school modified its name to <strong>The Franciscan University of the Prairies,</strong> in order to avoid confusion with similarly named schools.</p>
<p>In March 2005, the University was purchased by <a>Bridgepoint Education</a>, Inc.
After the completion of the sale, the institution's name was changed to Ashford University.
Sponsorship by the Sisters of St. Francis ended.

<h2>US Department of Education audit</h2>
<p>In May 2008, The US Department of Educations Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit services division commenced a compliance audit of  Ashford University covering the period March 10, 2005, through June 30, 2009.
The OIG indicated it is considering audit findings in the following areas: compensation policies and practices relating to enrollment advisors; calculation of returns of Title IV program funds; timeliness of returns of Title IV program funds; student authorizations to retain credit balances; disbursements of unearned Title IV program funds; and maintenance of supporting documentation for students' leaves of absence.
Bridgepoint Education Inc., a for- profit provider of college classes, fell the most in almost five months in New York trading after saying a government audit asserts the company misused federal student aid.</p>
