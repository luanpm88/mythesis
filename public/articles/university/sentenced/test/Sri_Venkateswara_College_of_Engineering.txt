The college obtained an <a>ISO 9001:2000</a> certification in 2002.]<a>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;</a>
The <a>Principal</a> of the college is Dr.R Ramachandran who is a Professor in the Department of <a>Computer Science and Engineering</a>, having previously served as Professor and Head of the Departments of <a>Information Technology</a> and Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
<h3>Challenges and controversies</h3>
<p><a>thumb|SVCE's main block houses the library and administration blocks</a> SVCE went under the government scrutiny with the Directorate of Technical Education (DOTE) intensifying its drive against the collection of capitation fee and tuition fee in excess of that prescribed.</p>
<p>It was found that a donation of  was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to the SPIC Educational Trust.
DOTE officials are said to have found that the trust was an unregistered entity and traced its bank account, which was supposedly linked to the college.
DOTE officials claimed they would initiate legal action against the college and also ask the <a>AICTE</a> to cancel its recognition in the forthcoming academic year.
Later it was proved that college had no active relationship with Spic Educational Trust.</p>
<p>The crackdown by the Directorate of Technical Education officials on the college did not, however, stop the filling up of its seats under the single window system in the first few days of the 2007 DOTE counselling.</p>
