<p>The <strong>University of Wolverhampton</strong> is a <a>British</a> <a>university</a> located on four campuses across the <a>West Midlands</a> and <a>Shropshire</a>.
The city campus is located in <a>Wolverhampton</a> city centre with a second campus at <a>Compton</a> Park, Wolverhampton; a third in <a>Walsall</a> and a fourth in <a>Telford</a>.
There is a fifth campus at Burton; where many of the Nursing Students reside.</p>
<p>The institution was known as Wolverhampton <a>Polytechnic</a> before gaining university status in 1992.
Its roots lie in the 19th Century growth of the Wolverhampton Mechanics&#x2019; Institute (founded 1835); the Wolverhampton Free Library (1870); and the School of Art, established in 1851, which came together as the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College in 1931.</p>
<p>The University has eight academic schools and cross-disciplinary research centres and institutes.</p>
<p>It has approximately 23,000 students</p>
<p>The University is noted for its success in encouraging wider participation in higher education and is the only university in Britain where the majority of undergraduates are from working-class backgrounds.</p>
<p>In 1931 His Royal Highness, <a>Prince George</a>, laid the foundation stone for the new Wolverhampton and <a>Staffordshire</a> Technical College.</p>
<p>By 1945, the creation of the Music Department allowed the College to capitalise on the growing demand for a variety of subject areas.
Enrolment in the first year totalled 135, and by 1950 HM Inspectors stated &quot;it was unique among technical colleges&quot;.
Indeed, the composer <a>Vaughn Williams</a> attended a performance of his &#x2018;Riders to the Sea&#x2019; in early 1950.</p>
<p>In 1951 the College&#x2019;s name was changed to the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire College of Technology, and the work of the High School of Commerce was partially transferred to the College.</p>
<p>In 1956 the Joint Education Committee of the college noted: &quot;Research is an essential feature of any institution of higher learning.
Very good work is being done in applied science, and mechanical engineering is bringing to fruition negotiation with a local firm for sponsored research into problems at heat exchangers&quot;.
and from September 2009 began restoration at <a>The National Museum of Computing</a>, <a>Bletchley Park</a>.</p>
<p>By 1964 with the further expansion of Higher Education the college began to provide BA degrees with options in English, Geography, History, Music, and Economics amongst others.
By 1965 the college was offering a degree in Computer Technology.</p>
<p>1970 saw the opening of the New School of Art and Design, opened by <a>Sir Charles Wheeler</a>.
Mergers with Teacher Training Colleges in Wolverhampton and Dudley in the 1970s added to the expansion of the Polytechnic, with additional growth in 1989 on Walsall Campus when the University acquired the Teacher Training College site.</p>
<p>In 1992 the Polytechnic was granted <a>university</a> status and became the University of Wolverhampton.</p>
<h3>Expansion years</h3>
<p>The University was further expanded by the construction of the Telford Campus, completed in 1994, which includes in its grounds the 18th Century, Grade II listed Priorslee Hall; the oldest building under the University of Wolverhampton&#x2019;s banner.
Telford Campus teaches students from the Business School and Engineering and Built Environment.</p>
<p>1994 also saw Wolverhampton become the first UK university to be awarded the <a>Charter Mark</a> for excellence in customer service.
From 2000-2010 &#x00a3;115 million was invested in campus developments.
Highlights include the &#x00a3;26 million MC building opening by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP in February 2003.</p>
<p>This was followed in 2004 by a teaching building called the 'Technology Centre', home of the School of Computing and IT,  with in excess of 400 high-specification PCs running the very latest software for multimedia, games development and databases.
The same year a &#x00a3;4 million extension to the Harrison Learning Centre was completed.</p>
<p>In October 2005 Professor Caroline Gipps became Vice-Chancellor - the University's first female Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>In 2006 the City Campus North Administration and Teaching Building was erected, providing space for a 120-seat lecture theatre, 4 elliptical 35-seat learning pods and the bringing together of many administration departments to work all under the one roof and in 2007 a new building at Walsall Campus, which can accommodate over 1,100 students is arranged over four floors and provides a combination of specialist and open access IT facilities and office accommodation for the School of Education.</p>
<p>2009 saw the formation and launch of two new Schools: the School of Law, Social Sciences and Communications  and the School of Health and Wellbeing, as well as the launch of the research group Centre for Developmental and Applied Research in Education (CeDARE) .</p>
<p>The new School of Technology launched on 1 September 2010.</p>
