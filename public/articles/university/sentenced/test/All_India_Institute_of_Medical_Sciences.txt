<p><strong>All India Institute of Medical Sciences</strong> (<strong>AIIMS</strong>) is a premier <a>medical college</a> and hospital in <a>New Delhi</a>, <a>India</a>.
</p>
<p>AIIMS is considered as one of the most prestigious medical colleges in India  and is globally recognized for providing low-cost medical care to a large number of patients.
It was established as an institute of national importance by an act of the Indian parliament with the objective of developing a strong curriculum and teaching guidelines for undergraduate and post-graduate education in all branches of medicine in India.
AIIMS seeks to achieve a high standard of medical education in India and to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order so as to attain self-sufficiency in good quality post-graduate medical education.
Because of low cost facilities and highly efficient practitioners AIIMS has been for many years registering patients far above its capacity.
For this prime reason, in 2004, the then prime minister of India; Mr. Atal Bihari Bajpayee announced the establishment of six new AIIMS to be built at Jodhpur, Rishikesh, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Raipur and Patna.

<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a>right|Central lawn, with teaching block in the background|200px|thumb</a> AIIMS is located in Ansari Nagar in south Delhi.
It is adjacent to the South Extension-II market, and lies on the south-eastern quadrant of Aurbindo Marg and Inner Ring Road crossing.
Across AIIMS is <a>Safdarjung Hospital</a> and associated <a>Vardhman Mahavir Medical College</a> (of <a>Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University</a>).
Also, adjacently lies the headquarters of <a>Indian Council of Medical Research</a> (<a>ICMR</a>), the body that coordinates and funds medical research in India.
In vicinity, also lies <a>National Medical Library</a>, run by the Directorate-General of Health Services (DGHS) of the Government of India.
It has a vast collection of scientific and medical journals that can be accessed by researchers.
Farthest along the stretch is the NAMS house, the official building of the <a>National Academy of Medical Sciences</a>, which is a prestigious body of eminent doctors from across India.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>upright|thumb|The Foundation Stone at AIIMS commemorates the gift from New Zealand</a> <a>upright|thumb|Foundation stone at the Academic Building of AIIMS, placed by Queen Elizabeth II</a> AIIMS was inaugurated in 1956, and was built with a grant from the <a>Government of New Zealand</a>.
AIIMS was established in New Delhi after former Indian Prime Minister <a>Jawaharlal Nehru</a>'s intitial proposal to set up the institute in Calcutta was turned down by the then Chief Minister of West Bengal Dr <a>Bidhan Chandra Roy</a>.
It was the vision of <a>Rajkumari Amrit Kaur</a>, the first Health Minister of India, to establish an institute of such nature in India.
She envisioned an autonomous medica</p>
<h2>Ranking</h2>
<p>AIIMS has been consistently ranked the top medical college in India to pursue an MBBS degree by <a>India Today</a> in annual surveys starting in 1997.
</p>
<p>AIIMS' excellence has to do with several factors - small class size, excellent library facilities, liberal clinically oriented teaching, research exposure and the ability to set its own curriculum.
</p>
<p>The hospital has been able to maintain high standards of quality while seeing large numbers of patients (3.5 million in 2006) at very low cost to patients (10 Indian Rupees for outpatient doctor consultation equivalent to approx US $0.25), many of whom live in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>However, AIIMS is plagued by bureaucracy, corruption, and emigration of talent pool and it has begun losing its sheen to several private medical centres and hospitals mushrooming across <a>Delhi</a>.
</p>

<h4>Undergraduate courses</h4>
<p><strong><a>M.B.B.S.</a></strong></p>
<p>Every year AIIMS accepts 72 Indian students, of which 37 belong to General Category and 16 belong to the reserved category (SC/ST), 19 Seats for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 3% orthopedic physically handicapped, based on the results of an all-India entrance examination for its undergraduate M.B.B.S program.The number of students who take the entrance exam every year varies from 80,000 to 100,000.
The acceptance rate for admission to the undergraduate course (medical school) is thus 72/90000 i.e. 0.08%.</p>
<p>Five international students (nominated by Government of India from SAARC nations) complete the class size of 77.
AIIMS also specializes in paramedical and basic science training for its undergraduates.
AIIMS is one of the few institutions where the faculty-student ratio is actually the reverse of the norm, i.e. there are more faculty members than students.</p>
<p><strong><a>B.Sc.</a> (Hons.) in <a>Ophthalmic Technique</a></strong></p>
<p>This course is of 3+1 years duration, and is aimed at enabling the students to achieve general understanding of <a>Human Biology</a> and in-depth knowledge of <a>medical science</a> related to basic <a>Ophthalmology</a>, viz., Ocular Anatomy, Ocular Physiology, Ocular Biochemistry, Ocular Pathology, Ocular Microbiology and Ocular Pharmacology, as well as clinical <a>Ophthalmology</a>, viz., <a>Physiological Optics</a>, <a>Orthoptics</a>, Investigative Ophthalmology, <a>Low Vision Aids</a>, <a>Contact Lenses</a>.

<h4>Post-graduate courses</h4>
<p>There are about forty-two speciality post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS.
The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination held every six months.
Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately ,&lt;1% of the candidates are admitted through the process- making it one of the most difficult tests.
These courses are highly coveted by the medical graduates across the country because of the institution's excellent medical services, exposure to unusual and referred cases and excellent opportunities for research.</p>
<h3>Integrating clinics and research</h3>
<p>AIIMS was originally built as a Superspeciality tertiary care (refers to India's three-tier health system with Primary clinics, which refer cases to secondary district level hospitals, which in turn refer cases to regional tertiary hospitals) centre with primary emphasis on research and specialized training facilities.
MBBS is the basic medical course, the same as medical school.
This is followed by specialization, which is the term for postgrad training in General Surgery, General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics and other fields.
Superspecialities are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduations, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, Neurology, Pediatric Neurology etc.There are at least 45 superspecialities at AIIMS.
Having clinical superspecialities in the same campus as its major research facilities makes AIIMS optimally suited for nurturing best quality translational research, which can translate into clinically useful end products, in India.
1234 AIIMS publishes <a>The National Medical Journal of India</a>, among India's most prestigious clinical journals.
Its impact factor is the highest among Indian journals after the Indian journal of Medical Research (published by the Indian Council of Medical Research).</p>
<h2>Medical services</h2>
<p>As per the AIIMS Citizen's Charter, doctors &amp; staff at AIIMS strive to provide comprehensive, high quality tertiary care services including specialty and super-specialty services to all without consideration of caste, creed, religion, sex, economic status or disability.
However, there may be some deficiencies due to extreme patient load and finite resources.
Acquiring newer equipment for investigation, research and patient care is expedited as it is not constrained by funds.</p>
<h3>Speciality centres at AIIMS</h3>
<p>There is a separate cardiothoracic and neurosciences centre (CNC) offering superspeciality level patient care, training and research in the respective fields.

<p><strong>Dr.
Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences</strong> is a 300 bed ophthalmic (eyes) speciality centre designated as the apex eye referral centre for India, and is the <a>WHO</a> collaborating centre for ophthalmic programs.
</p>
<p>Recently <strong>Dr.
BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital</strong><em>'s construction has been completed.
It specializes in medical, radiation and surgical oncology.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre</strong> is India's first full-fledged centre to treat victims of trauma.
It is located about 1 KM west from the main campus.</p>
<p>CDER, the <strong>Centre for Dental Education and Research</strong>, located adjacent to the Hostels, is AIIMS' newest speciality centre.</p>
<p>AIIMS also runs the <strong>National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre</strong> at Ghaziabad, one of Delhi's suburbs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Centre for Community Medicine</strong> at AIIMS maintains a teaching and treatment facility at Ballabgarh, which is a periurban area outside Delhi, it also provides comprehensive services to 84000 population.
Faculty members from AIIMS are posted there by rotation.</p>
<h2>Residential facilities</h2>
<p>AIIMS is a residential university where the faculty members, staff and  students live on either the main campus or one of the several campuses which form a part of the Institution.
There are five hostels for men undergraduate students (Hostel No.1-5) and a single hostel available for women undergraduate students (Hostel 10).
These six hostels together can accommodate 850 students.
For Post-graduate students, there are three hostels available for the men students and married couples(Hostel No.6-8) and a single hostel for the women students(Hostel No.9).
Additional hostels for Nursing students and Post-graduate students are available at a facility in the Masjid Moth area, situated near to the main AIIMS campus.
Hostels for MBBS/ MD / nursing students are also located at Ballabgarh, Dayalpur and Chainsa used during Ballabgarh posting.</p>
<h2>Student life and academics</h2>
<p>MBBS life in AIIMS has a distinctive laid-back character.
Attendance was not made compulsory until a few years ago, with students being given full liberty to organize their own study patterns.
<a>upright|thumb|AIIMS students educating residents of a Delhi slum about preventing mosquito-borne illnesses</a></p>
<p>The limitation of class size to just 50 per year ensures a close-knit student community of just over 250 people.
The student body is predominantly male, with men forming approximately 80% of every batch.
This is in contrast to the situation with most other medical colleges, where women are represented in larger numbers.
Hostel life centers around the Quadrangle in the Gents' hostel, where most students can be seen lounging or studying.</p>
<p>AIIMS has a cosmopolitan student body, owing to its location in the national capital, as well as its countrywide reputation.
Students from Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Mauritius and other nations add some of their own flavor.
Exchange students from several Indian and international medical schools also mix with the existing crowd.
The students are represented by the AIIMS Students' Union, headed by an executive committee that is elected every year from students of 4th year.
</p>
<p>Students of AIIMS involve themselves in extra-academic movements, including <a>Pulse</a>, the annual, inter-college festival hosted by AIIMS.
Pulse is easily India's largest medical fest, with daily attendance ranging from 5000 to 15000.
A large, well-equipped students' gym, swimming pool and courts for tennis, basketball, volleyball, squash and soccer provide ample recreational opportunities.
Prayatna is a student organization that arranges <a>blood donation</a> camps for the fulfillment of perpetual shortage of blood at the AIIMS blood bank.</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AIIMS is the first Indian center to perform a successful cardiac transplant.
The surgery was performed by Dr. <a>P.
Venugopal</a>, the ex director of AIIMS in 1994.</li>
<li>AIIMS is a leader in Stem Cell therapy, especially Cardiac and Neurological.</li>
<li>AIIMS has India's first and only minimally invasive surgery training centre, under collaboration with Germany.</li>
<li>It is a pioneer of robotic surgeries in India, particularly the Da Vinci system for urology, and robotic CTVS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Controversy regarding its Director</h3>
<p>The Director of AIIMS has been sacked in 2006, after a certain amount of controversy which also included filing a case before the Delhi High Court.This happened as a result of a resolution which was passed by the 17 member governing body of the institute.
Many people have touted this to be an extension of the Ramadoss (The Union Health Minister &amp; The President of AIIMS) and P Venugopal rivalry.
On 8 May 2008,Venugopal was re-instated as AIIMS director by a Supreme Court judgement.</p>
<h3>Institutional quota</h3>
<p>Prior to Supreme court judgment of 25 August 2001 and changes in institutional quota, AIIMS was criticised for the way 33% of Post Graduation Seats were reserved for those who complete their MBBS in AIIMS.
This has been rectified and now admissions to the post-graduate courses at AIIMS are much sought after from medical graduates throughout the country.
There is now a curtain on the controversy for the present, since the Supreme Court judgment has in effect clearly defined the administrative intricacies and application of rules.</p>
<p>The honourable <a>Supreme Court of India</a>, stated that reserving 33 per cent seats for institutional candidates was in effect 100 per cent reservation for subjects, which was declared ultra vires the Constitution, and, hence, was struck down.
The quota has been quashed by the Supreme Court as per its Judgment in the year 2001.
However, people fail to realise that this goes grossly against the students of AIIMS.
As calculated above, the acceptance rate for the MBBS course at AIIMS works out to be about 0.08%.
This means that not only intelligence and hard work, but also some degree of good fortune is required to be selected into AIIMS.
Once students join AIIMS, they lose their domicile rights to write the post-graduate entrances to other state-level PG entrance tests (as most states require people to do MBBS from the same state to be eligible to apply).
Secondly, doing an MBBS from AIIMS does not allow you to appear for the Delhi pre-PG tests because AIIMS is an autonomous institute and not under the Delhi University.
Hence the graduates of AIIMS have the eligibility to compete only in national level entrance exams and the All India pre-PG test.
The result is that the AIIMS graduate is, in fact, left with fewer opportunities for competing for a PG seat.
The fallout of this verdict is that more AIIMS graduates than before are migrating to the US for their higher education.</p>
<h3>Caste based quota</h3>
<p> AIIMS students joined in the nation-wide protests which took place in May, 2006.
During the strike all the medical services were shut but parallel OPDs were started after the strike had been carried out for a long time.
The strike continued till 31 May when the doctors called off their strike after the <a>Supreme Court of India</a> orders.</p>
<p>There is also a minuscule section of AIIMS students and doctors under the banner Progressive Medicos and scientists Forum (PMSF) who have traditionally taken a pro-reservation stance on the basis of social justice.
Eventually the Supreme Court found sanctity in the voice raised by RDA-AIIMS and the NGO YouthForEquality  [<a>http://www.youthforequality.com</a>]
through a PIL.
The hon'ble SC stayed the OBC reservation bill on ground of being politically mooted and its judgment is awaited.</p>
<h3>2006 controversy over AIIMS' autonomy</h3>
<p>AIIMS doctors again went on a flash strike in June&#x2013;July 2006 over the issue of increasing political interference in the institution by the Union Health Minister <a>Anbumani Ramadoss</a>.
The doctors decided to go on strike following the controversial sacking of P. Venugopal, the former director of AIIMS.
Venugopal challenged his sacking in the court of law, and the strike ended following the Delhi High Court's decision staying Venugopal's sacking on 7 July 2006.
However, Ramadoss filed an appeal in the <a>Supreme Court of India</a> against the stay on the removal of AIIMS Director on the same day.
On 25 July, the government offered to withdraw its order sacking Venugopal but would raise charges against him before a single-bench court.
During this controversy some patients of AIIMS died due to lack of treatment.</p>
