<p> </p>
<p><strong>China Academy of Art</strong> () is the highest university of art in <a>China</a>.
It was founded in <a>Hangzhou</a> in 1928 by the <a>government</a> of <a>Republic of China</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>China Academy of Art</strong> (also <strong>China National Academy of Fine Arts</strong>), colloquially known in Chinese as <strong>Guomei</strong> (&#x570b;&#x7f8e;, <em>Gu&#x00f3;m&#x011b;i</em>).</p>
<p>The China Academy of Art has the most complete range of degree offerings and programs of study in fine arts in China.
There are eight schools under its jurisdiction offering Ph.D., master&#x2019;s and bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in fine arts, design, architecture, multi-media and film.
</p>
<p>There are currently 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students in three campuses with a faculty and staff of 800.
The administration of the Academy is headquartered in the Nanshan Campus, which is located right on the beautiful West Lake in Hangzhou.
Students in the Master's program live on the alternate campus 40 minutes away, on the outskirts of <a>Hangzhou</a>.
A free bus is offered to transport students to and from the campus from the dorms at designated times.
Taxis do not drive to the outlying campus after 4:30 in Hangzhou.
Other regional campuses are the Zhangjiang Campus, which is strategically located in Shanghai, and the Xiangshan Central Campus.
In the <a>Eleventh Five-Year Plan</a>, the undergraduate student population will grow to 6,600 with a graduate student body of 800, making it one of the biggest fine art institutions in the world.
</p>
<p>Undergraduate students typically spend one year in general education courses in the Department of Foundation and then three years in the core courses of their particular majors.
Graduate courses are typically three years long and include extensive experience in the studio and research with mentoring faculty.
Foreign students can take short-term or long-term courses in Chinese art, language and culture in the Institute of International Education.
Courses are taught mainly in Chinese, so students are advised to take 1 year of only Chinese classes before attending art classes.
In order to progress onto art classes, students must take a Chinese proficiency test.
If students do not pass the Chinese reading/writing/speaking test, they can enroll in a second year of Chinese lessons.</p>
<p>The school is not run in western measures, meaning it is the student's job, not the faculty to orientate around the school.
It is the students responsibility to locate learning materials, living amenities, and departments such as the financial office.
</p>
<p>Lodging standards will differ on basis of cash pay or scholarship.
Scholarship students are not permitted to live with cash paying students.
Scholarships are not available to students above mid-30's.</p>
<p>As of 2010, Enrollment tuition is Y38,000.
Visitors will be billed Y200 a night to sleep in the dorms.
Cooking and smoking are not permitted in the dorms.
Dorm rooms on the Nanshan campus house up to 2 foreigners or 6 Chinese students, although students considered of senior age will be allotted a private room with 2 beds.</p>
<p>China Academy's pedagogy consists mostly of mimicking techniques of former Chinese artists rather than appropriating to one's own style.
China Academy encourages communistic unity in scaffolding techniques, rather than by western <a>Montessori method</a>s.
Only through constant repetition of copying former works can one successfully achieve level of proper traditional Chinese painting and other medias.</p>
<p>The Academy encourages diversity in thinking, art exploration and academy research.
It takes as its motto &#x201c;diversity in harmony&#x201d; and fosters an environment for innovation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
