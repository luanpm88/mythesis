<p>Edith Cowan University was named after the first woman to be elected to an <a>Australian Parliament</a>, <a>Edith Dircksey Cowan</a>, and is the only Australian <a>university</a> named after a woman.
<a>Edith Dircksey Cowan</a> worked tirelessly to raise funds for students to attend universities in other states, prior to a university being built in Western Australia, obtaining government support for her scheme.
Her work in this area was acknowledged by naming Western Australia's oldest education institution and newest university after her, as well as her image being added to the Australian $50 note.
