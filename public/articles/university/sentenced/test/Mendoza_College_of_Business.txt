<p> The <strong>Mendoza College of Business</strong> is a highly ranked American business school.
It is one of the colleges at the <a>University of Notre Dame</a>, which is located in South Bend, <a>Indiana</a> of the <a>United States</a>.
The core <a>philosophy</a> of the Mendoza College can be found from Rev. O'Hara's understanding of commerce; &quot;The primary function of commerce is service to mankind,&quot; and &quot;Business has a code of ethics based very largely on divine principles.
When this code is followed, commerce can and does advance <a>civilization</a>.
When it is overlooked by selfish interests, individual or national, every sort of injustice, from petty thievery to world war, may result.&quot;
The undergraduate program is ranked 1st and the MBA program is ranked 20th by Business Week.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

Four years earlier, in 1917, Notre Dame had become the first university in the United States to launch a four-year program of study in &quot;foreign commerce.&quot;</p>
