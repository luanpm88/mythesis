<h2>History</h2>
<p> Founded in 1770 and chartered in 1785, the College of Charleston is the oldest institution of higher education in South Carolina, and the 13th oldest in the United States.
During the colonial period, wealthy families sent their sons abroad for higher education.
By the mid-18th century, many leading citizens supported the idea of establishing an institution of higher learning within the state.
On January 30, 1770, Lieutenant Governor William Bull recommended to the colony&#x2019;s general assembly the establishment of a provincial college.
However, internal disagreements, political rivalries and the American Revolution delayed its progress.
After the war, South Carolinians returned their attention to establishing a college.
</p>
<p>On March 19, 1785, the College of Charleston was chartered to &#x201c;encourage and institute youth in the several branches of liberal education.&#x201d;
The Act of the statehouse provided for three colleges simultaneously: one in <a>Charleston</a>, one in <a>Winnsboro</a> and one in Cambridge.
The Act also granted the College almost  of land bounded by present-day Calhoun, St. Philip, Coming and George streets; three-fourths of the land was soon sold to pay debts, but the College is still centered in that section of Charleston.
Only the College of Charleston continues today as a college.</p>
<p>The College was rechartered in 1791 because of questions about the 1785 Act, and the trustees hired Rev. (later Bishop) Robert Smith as the first president of the College, and the first classes were held at his home on Glebe Street (the current home of the College of Charleston president).
Robert Smith served as the College's first president.
Educated in <a>England</a>, he was ordained as a priest in the <a>Anglican Church</a> and relocated to <a>Charleston</a>, where he served as rector of St. Philip&#x2019;s Church.
During the <a>American Revolution</a>, he supported the <a>Patriot</a> cause and even served as a soldier during the siege of the city.
He later became the first <a>Episcopal</a> <a>bishop</a> of <a>South Carolina</a>.
He relocated the school to a brick range which had been constructed for use as quarters for soldiers during the <a>Revolutionary War</a>.</p>
<p>Dr.
Smith continued as the president until 1797.
It was during his term (1794) that the school graduated its first class with the degree of A.B., a class which consisted of six students.
The oldest of the students was only 18, and the work for a decree was considered so easy that one of its first graduates said that &quot;the whole thing was absurd.&quot;
Rev. Adams' plans for enlarging the school met opposition both locally and from the <a>General Assembly</a> which found his plans antagonistic to the interest of the <a>South Carolina College</a> (today known as the <a>University of South Carolina</a>).</p>
<p>Rev.
Adams left the school in 1826, and the future of the College appeared bleak.
In 1837, however, the <a>City of Charleston</a> decided that it would be in the city's interest to have a &quot;home college.&quot;
In 1837, the city council took over control of the school and assumed the responsibility for its finances and for electing its trustees.
As such, it became the nation&#x2019;s first municipal college.
The city provided funds, for example, in 1850 to enlarge the main academic building (Randolph Hall), to construct Porters Lodge and to fence in the Cistern Yard, the block that is still the core of the campus.
It remained a <a>municipal college</a> until the <a>1950s</a>, when the College again became a private institution.</p>
<p>Several of the College&#x2019;s founders played key roles in the <a>American Revolution</a> and in the creation of the new republic.
Three were signers of the <a>Declaration of Independence</a> and another three were framers of the <a>U.S. Constitution</a>.
Other founders were past, present and future federal and state lawmakers and judges, The main building, as designed by <a>William Strickland</a>, was built in 1828-29 and was revised in 1850 by the work of <a>Edward Brickell White</a> which added &quot;six giant Roman Ionic pillars&quot; and otherwise developed a more &quot;grandiose&quot; vision.
The Gate Lodge, designed by White and now known as Porters Lodge, was built in 1852 in a matching Roman Revival style.
The College Library was designed by <a>George E. Walker</a> and was built in 1854-1856.</p>
<p>The English Department at the College of Charleston publishes <em>Crazyhorse</em>, a national literary magazine.</p>
<h3>Greek Life</h3>
<p>Greek Life has been active on campus for 120 years.
There are 10 active IFC fraternities, 9 active Panhellenic sororities, (Spring of 2010 <a>Delta Gamma</a> and <a>Phi Kappa Tau</a> joined the campus) and 7 NPHC fraternities and sororities on campus.</p>
