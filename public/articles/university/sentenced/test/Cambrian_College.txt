Marie</a>; the North Bay and Sault campuses became the independent <a>Canadore College</a> and <a>Sault College</a> in 1972 and 1973, respectively.</p>
<p>Until 1995, Cambrian was a <a>bilingual</a> institution, offering courses in both English and French.
In that year, the francophone programs were transferred to the new <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Bor&#x00e9;al</a>.</p>
