<h3>Fiterman Hall and the September 11 attacks</h3>
<p>[[Image:Fiterman hall damage.jpg|thumb|The
college's Fiterman Hall was heavily damaged from the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center]] on 9-11, and had to be demolished.]]
<strong>Fiterman Hall</strong> was a 15-story building on the campus of this college at 30 West Broadway in Lower Manhattan.
It opened in 1959 as an office building before owner Miles Fiterman, whom the building was named after, donated it to BMCC in 1993, which at the time was the largest private donation to a community college in U.S. history.
It was renovated in 2000 to receive new windows and infrastructure.
The building was owned by the State of New York Dormitory Authority.
</p>
<p>It was heavily damaged during the <a>September 11 attacks</a> in 2001, when debris from the collapse of 7 WTC compromised the structure.
It became unsafe to occupy due to mold growth and asbestos exposure.
Because traditional demolition would result in an unacceptable environmental impact, the building was scheduled for deconstruction and decontamination as part of the Lower Manhattan redevelopment project.</p>
<p>Fiterman Hall was to have been replaced by a new building designed by the architectural firm <a>Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners</a>.
Deconstruction was scheduled to be complete by February 2007; however, environmental impact concerns and funding issues caused numerous delays in completing the project.
At a press conference, which took place at BMCC on November 13, 2008, city and state officials announced a new agreement which solidified demolition and reconstruction plans through a funding agreement with New York City, New York State, and the City University of New York.
In addition, approximately $80 million will come from an insurance settlement.
Under the plan, the new Fiterman Hall will be completed in 2012.
The building was finally demolished in November 2009 after all asbestos had been removed.&lt;!--
The following ref fell foul of the spam filter:  --&gt; Construction of its replacement began on 1 December.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The college has won multiple awards from the CUNY system as well as other institutions for its ability to grant Associate's Degrees at an impressive rate and to foster continuing education at senior colleges.
With a respectable teacher-to-student ratio, significant public and private funding, and a central location in New York City, the learning experience has been covered by many publications and studied by experts.</p>
<p>However, BMCC also suffers from the same problems that plague all community colleges such as an alarming rise in remedial education , lack of freshman retention, and overcrowding.
Due to its larger base of capital compared to most other two-year colleges, expansion of new campuses during the rebuilding of Fiterman Hall was possible.
Several trailers are still used as classrooms to this day in order to help expand capacity.
Internal programs have also been created or expanded to help with academic advisement, provide online access for registration, transferring to other colleges, and job placement.</p>
<p>A diverse student base, some of whom are only recent arrivals in America also makes tailoring a viable solution difficult.
Improving the retention and graduation rate as well as the increased financial and academic burdens of a remedial program still remain a considerable problem.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>BMCC offers a large state-of-the-art recreation facility including a regulation basketball court, <a>swimming pool</a>, and weight room.
There are active teams in many sports such as <a>handball</a>, <a>bowling</a>, <a>baseball</a>, <a>soccer</a>, and <a>basketball</a>.
Sports teams compete in both the <a>CUNY</a> athletic system and the local <a>NCAA</a> collegiate sports system despite being a community college.
The women's basketball team has won numerous championships including the CUNY basketball championship and the regional <a>Division III</a> championships including placing third nationally in 2000 with a 21-3 <a>regular season</a> record.The chess team has won national awards.</p>
