<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|North Great Building (&#x5317;&#x5927;&#x697c;)</a>  Nanjing University was founded in 1915 with the name Nanjing Higher Normal School south to Qintian mountain, on the site of former Nanking Imperial University.
<strong>Imperial Nanking University</strong>, the predecessor of Nanjing University, was originally founded in the first year of Yong'an reign (CE 258) under the <a>Kingdom of Wu</a> by <a>Emperor Jing of Wu</a>, and the first president was <a>Wei Zhao</a> (&#x97cb;&#x662d;).
The Imperial University in Nanking (&#x5357;&#x4eac;&#x592a;&#x5b78;, Nanking Taixue) was reestablished by <a>Emperor Yuan of Jin</a> in 317 and 155 new rooms were built in the campus which was located in today's <a>Fuzimiao</a> (&#x592b;&#x5b50;&#x5edf;) area situated on <a>Qinhuai River</a> banks.
Like its original forerunner Chengjun (&#x6210;&#x5747;) and succeeding <a>Shang Hsiang</a> (&#x4e0a;&#x5ea0;) founded by <a>Yu</a> (&#x79b9;, 21st century BCE) in Chungyuan, the earliest recorded imperial higher learning institutions and their successors, it was the Kingdom's central university, with the role of educating literate and virtuous citizens and educating leaders to govern and serve the kingdom.
In 470 during the <a>Song Dynasty</a>, the Imperial Nanking University became a comprehensive institution combining higher education and research and consisted of five divisions: Literature, History, <a>Confucianism</a>, <a>Xuan Study</a> and <a>Yin Yang Study</a>,.
The campus of School of Literature and School of History were once located in today's Nanjing University Gulou campus, southwest to <a>Gulou</a> (&#x9f13;&#x6a13;) mountain which is the extending part of Qintian mountain, and then the main campus was located in today's <a>Chaotian Palace</a> (&#x671d;&#x5929;&#x5bae;) area at the time when <a>Wang Jian</a> (&#x738b;&#x4fed;) was university president.
In the period the faculty members included such scholars and scientists as <a>Zu Chongzhi</a> (&#x7956;&#x6c96;&#x4e4b;), <a>Ge Hong</a> (&#x845b;&#x6d2a;), <a>Wang Xizhi</a> (&#x738b;&#x7fb2;&#x4e4b;), and students included such figures as Xiao Daocheng, <a>Emperor Gao of Southern Qi</a> who studied in school of Confucian studies, and <a>Zhong Rong</a>, a founding scholar of poetics who graduated from division of literature.
In 937 when the campus was again in Fuzimiao area, the school scholar <a>Li shandao</a> established another national school outside capital city which is called <a>Bailudong Shuyuan</a> (<a>White Deer Grotto Academy</a>), a famous academy located in <a>Lushan</a> that later hosted many renowned scholars including <a>Zhu Xi</a> and <a>Lu Jiuyuan</a>.
In 1381 <strong>Imperial Central University</strong> (&#x570b;&#x5b50;&#x76e3;, <a>Guozijian</a>) moved campus from Nanking Fuzimiao area to south of Qintian Mountain (&#x6b3d;&#x5929;&#x5c71;), near <a>Xuanwu Lake</a>.
The university developed and flourished in the period, consisting of 6 schools: 3 basic level colleges, 2 middle level schools and 1 advanced level school.
In 1403 <a>Beijing Guozijian</a> (Imperial Beijing University) was established.
<a>Yongle Encyclopedia</a> was completed in Nanking campus in 1408 after 5 years compilation, 9169 scholars selected from nationwide took part in it, there into 2180 were student scholars of the university of Nanking and besides many were faculty members.
The publishing house of Imperial Nanking University (&#x5357;&#x4eac;&#x570b;&#x5b50;&#x76e3;, Nanking Guozijian) published many kinds and numerous volumes of books and had been a most important publishing centre for several hundred years.
In the 15th century the Imperial Nanking University was the world's largest higher education institution, with students about 10 thousand, many of whom came from a number of countries.
<a>Wu Cheng'en</a> and <a>Zheng Chenggong</a> studied there during the <a>Ming Dynasty</a>.
Each time when Nanking became a non-capital city, the Nanking Imperial University was changed to be regional Nanking Academy.
The Imperial Nanking University was changed to <strong>Nanking Academy</strong> (&#x6c5f;&#x5be7;&#x5e9c;&#x5b78;, Jiangning Fuxue) in 1650 after <a>Qing Dynasty</a> replaced <a>Ming Dynasty</a>, and the academy was relocated to Chaotian Palace after Taiping Rebellion.
The school history of ancient times is recorded in the university's official history book before, and immediately after P.R.C was founded, the school authority took the year starting to establish the modern new type school Sanjiang Normal College as the school's new founding year.</p>

<p>In 1902, <strong>Sanjiang Normal College</strong> under new educational system, using Japanese modern higher institutions of learning as references, was established to replace the traditional Chinese school Nanking Academy.
The name was changed to <strong>Liangjiang Normal College</strong> in 1906, and the new president <a>Li Ruiqing</a> (&#x674e;&#x745e;&#x6e05;) established the first faculty of modern art in China.
In 1915 after the <a>Republic of China</a> replaced Qing Dynasty, the <strong>Nanking Higher Normal School</strong> (&#x5357;&#x4eac;&#x9ad8;&#x7b49;&#x5e2b;&#x7bc4;&#x5b78;&#x6821;) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed 3 years before, <a>Jiang Qian</a> (&#x6c5f;&#x8b19;) was appointed as the president, and the school established the first Faculty of modern Gymnastics (<a>Physical Education</a>) in 1916.</p>
<p>The &quot;<a>China Science Society</a>&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x570b;&#x79d1;&#x5b78;&#x793e;), a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded headquarter in the school in 1918.
Its members were main force that established &quot;<a>Academia Sinica</a>&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x592e;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x9662;) which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the &quot;<a>Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x56fd;&#x79d1;&#x5b66;&#x9662;) in mainland China.
Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in advanced countries in the era mostly in America and some European countries such as Britain, France and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China.
It became the Chinese cradle of modern science.
Hereafter, many graduates achieved pioneering works in many fields for Chinese scientific enterprise.
For instance, among 81 academicians of &quot;<a>Academia Sinica</a>&quot; elected for the first time in 1948, 5 entered or graduated from the university in the year 1920.
More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published on internationally renowned scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University.</p>
<p><a>Guo Bingwen</a> (&#x90ed;&#x79c9;&#x6587;) was an extremely influential university president, appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian.
The school meeting passed <em>The Audit Law for Women Students</em> (&#x300a;&#x898f;&#x5b9a;&#x5973;&#x5b50;&#x65c1;&#x807d;&#x6cd5;&#x6848;&#x300b;) on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist <a>Tao Xingzhi</a> (&#x9676;&#x884c;&#x77e5;), as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including <a>Liu Boming</a> (&#x5289;&#x4f2f;&#x660e;), <a>Lu Zhiwei</a> (&#x9678;&#x5fd7;&#x97cb;), <a>Yang Xingfo</a> (&#x694a;&#x674f;&#x4f5b;), etc.
In 1920 Nanjing Higher Normal school became the first in China to recruit <a>coeducation</a>al students and enrolled eight women students.
Student-centered education and Discipline-elective and Cause-credit-elective system were established.
In 1921 the <strong>National Southeastern University</strong> (&#x570b;&#x7acb;&#x6771;&#x5357;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it.
The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university.
It integrated teaching and research, with status of university&#x2019;s independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university.
The Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to Shanghai to establish the first <a>business school</a> in China.</p>
<p>In October 1921, &quot;Hsuehheng Society&quot; (or Xueheng Society, &#x5b78;&#x8861;&#x793e;) was founded in the university which was the focus of the &quot;Hsuehheng School&quot; included the scholars <a>Liu Yizheng</a> (&#x67f3;&#x8a52;&#x5fb5;), <a>Liu Boming</a> (&#x5289;&#x4f2f;&#x660e;), <a>Mei Guangdi</a> (&#x6885;&#x5149;&#x8fea;), <a>Wu Mi</a> (&#x5433;&#x5b93;) and <a>Hu Xianxiao</a> (&#x80e1;&#x5148;&#x9a4c;).
They tried to reinvigorate Confucian culture and start to publish the monthly &quot;Critical Review&quot; (Xueheng, &#x5b78;&#x8861; in Chinese) in January 1922.
It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and <a>humanism</a>.
In the views of the scholars of Xueheng school, Confucian thought can bring bright future for human peace and prosperity.
They tried to interact and communicate Confucian culture with other cultures especially humanism in modern western civilization, specifically especially new humanism represented by <a>Irving Babbitt</a> at the time.
During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost &quot;Oriental Education Centre&quot; and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west.
Many famous scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist <a>Paul Monroe</a>, <a>W.
H. Kilpatrick</a>, <a>E.
L. Thorndike</a>, philosopher <a>John Dewey</a>, British philosopher <a>Bertrand Russell</a>, German philosopher <a>Hans Driesch</a> and the <a>India</a>n (also <a>Bengal</a>i) poet <a>Rabindranath Tagore</a>.</p>
<p>The &quot;Chinese Association of Natural Science&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x83ef;&#x81ea;&#x7136;&#x79d1;&#x5b78;&#x793e;) was founded at the university in 1927.
In August 1928 the school became <strong>National Central University</strong> (&#x570b;&#x7acb;&#x4e2d;&#x592e;&#x5927;&#x5b78;).
During the <a>Anti-Japanese War</a> between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to <a>Chongqing</a>.
The &quot;Natural Science Forum&quot; was founded by the university faculties in 1939 and then they founded the &quot;China Association of Scientific Workers&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x570b;&#x79d1;&#x5b78;&#x5de5;&#x4f5c;&#x8005;&#x5354;&#x6703;) in 1944.
In 1958 the associations were merged to be the &quot;<a>China Association for Science and Technology</a>&quot; (&#x4e2d;&#x570b;&#x79d1;&#x5b78;&#x6280;&#x8853;&#x5354;&#x6703;) in Beijing.
The &quot;Natural Science Forum&quot; was renamed &quot;Sept.
3rd Forum&quot; and later again renamed &quot;Sept.
3rd Society&quot; in 1945.
The &quot;Sept.
3rd Society&quot;, or called &quot;Jiusan Society&quot;, is a China organization for intellectual groups.</p>
<p>In 1949, during the <a>Chinese Civil War</a>, the central government of the <a>Republic of China</a> retreated from <a>Nanjing</a> and the National Central University was renamed <strong>National Nanjing University</strong> (&#x570b;&#x7acb;&#x5357;&#x4eac;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) before the establishment of People's Republic of China.
In 1952, many departments and colleges of former Nanjing University got apart and formed many new independent colleges and universities, and Nanjing University site became the campus of one of them, Nanking Institute of Technology which later renamed <a>Southeast University</a>, and at the same time <strong><a>University of Nanking</a></strong> (&#x91d1;&#x9675;&#x5927;&#x5b78;), a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into <strong>Nanjing University</strong> (&#x5357;&#x4eac;&#x5927;&#x5b78;), which lost its &quot;national&quot; appellation to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was also once site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times.
A separate <a>National Central University</a> was reinstated in <a>Taiwan</a> by its old alumni association in 1962.</p>
<p>In 1976, the faculty members and students of the university launched Nanjing Anti <a>Cultural Revolution</a> Force Movement which was called &quot;<a>Nanjing Incident</a>&quot; by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide.
In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of the Philosophy Department of Nanjing University, wrote and published the historic article entitled &quot;Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth&quot;.
It led to the nationwide &quot;Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth&quot; and promoted the ending of <a>Cultural Revolution</a> and the coming of reform era.</p>
<p>Many faculties, departments, institutes and schools have been re-founded or initially founded since 1978.
In 2009, Xianlin Campus was opened, replacing Pukou Campus which was put into use in 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of Jinling College which was founded by Nanjing University.
The Xianlin Campus is a main campus along with Gulou Compus.</p>
