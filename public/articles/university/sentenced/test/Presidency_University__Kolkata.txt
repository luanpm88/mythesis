<p>   <strong>Presidency University, Kolkata</strong> (earlier <strong>Hindu College</strong> and <strong>Presidency College</strong>)  is a unitary, state aided university, located in <a>Kolkata</a>, <a>West Bengal</a>.
and one of the premier institutes of learning of liberal arts and sciences in India.
In 2002 it was ranked number one by the weekly news magazine <em><a>India Today</a></em>.
Established in 1817, it is the oldest educational institution in India.
It was founded by <a>Raja Ram Mohan Roy</a>, and a number of other eminent personalities of Bengal, such as Raja Radhakanta Deb, Maharaja Tejchandra Ray of Burdwan, <a>David Hare</a>, Justice Sir <a>Edward Hyde East</a>, <a>Prasanna Coomar Tagore</a> and Babu Buddinath Mukherjee.</p>
<p>Initially established as the <em>Mahapathshala</em> wing of Hindu College, it was renamed Presidency College, i.e. the college of the Bengal Presidency, in 1855.
In 2010 it was upgraded to the status of a full university by the Presidency University Act, 2010 passed in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly.
The Governor of West Bengal gave his consent to the bill on 7 July 2010.</p>
<p>The longest serving Principal of Presidency College was J. Sutcliff, who was its Principal intermittently for 20 years, from 1852-1875.
He was the Principal of the college when the college was renamed in 1855 and the new building at 86/1, College Street was built a few years later.
The first Indian (acting) Principal of the college was <a>P.K.Roy</a> (1902; 1903 and 1905&#x2013;1906) and the first Indian (full-time) Principal of the college was B.M.Sen (1931-1934 (acting) and 1934&#x2013;1942).</p>
<p>The university offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees as well as Ph.D. degrees in the <a>natural sciences</a>, <a>humanities</a> and the <a>social sciences</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>With the creation of the Supreme Court of Calcutta in 1773 many <a>Hindus</a> of <a>Bengal</a> showed eagerness to learn the English language.
<a>David Hare</a>, in collaboration with <a>Raja</a> <a>Radhakanta Deb</a> had already taken steps introduce English education in Bengal.
<a>Babu Buddinath Mukherjee</a> advanced the introduction of English as a medium of instruction further by enlisting the support of <a>Sir</a> <a>Edward Hyde East</a>, <a>Chief Justice</a> of the <a>Supreme Court</a> who called a meeting of 'European and Hindu Gentlemen' in his house in May 1816.
The purpose of the meeting was to &quot;discuss the proposal to establish an institution for giving a liberal education to the children of the members of the Hindu Community&quot;.
The proposal was received with unanimous approbation and a donation of over Rs. 100, 000 was promised for the setting up of the new college.
<a>Raja Ram Mohan Roy</a> showed full sympathy for the scheme but chose not to come out in support of the proposal publicly for fear of &quot;alarming the prejudices of his orthodox countrymen and thus marring the whole idea&quot;.</p>
<p>The College was formally opened on Monday, January 20, 1817 with 20 'scholars'.
The foundation committee of the college, which oversaw its establishment, was headed by <a>Raja Rammohan Roy</a>.
The control of the institution was vested in a body of two Governors and four Directors.
The first Governors of the college were <a>Maharaja Tejchandra Bahadur</a> of <a>Burdwan</a> and <a>Babu</a> <a>Gopee Mohan Thakoor</a>.
The first Directors were <a>Babu</a> <a>Gopeemohan Deb</a> of <a>Sobhabazar</a>, <a>Babu</a> <a>Joykissen Sinha</a>, <a>Babu</a> <a>Radha Madhab Banerjee</a> and <a>Babu</a> <a>Gunganarain Doss</a>.
Babu <a>Buddinath Mukherjee</a> was appointed as the first Secretary of the college.
The newly established college mostly admitted Hindu students from affluent and progressive families, but also admitted non-Hindu students such as <a>Muslim</a>s, <a>Jew</a>s, <a>Christian</a>s and <a>Buddhist</a>s.</p>
<p>At first the classes were held in a house belonging to Gorachand Bysack of Garanhatta (later renamed 304, Chitpore Road), which was rented by the college.
In January 1818 the college moved to 'Feringhi Kamal Bose's house' which was located nearby in Chitpore.
From Chitpore, the college moved to <a>Bowbazar</a> and later to the building that now houses the <a>Sanskrit College</a> on <a>College Street</a>.</p>
<h3>Early 19th century</h3>
<p>The increasing realization of the value of western education made the college a coveted destination for scholars from all over the subcontinent.
Pupils have come from almost all parts of the country, most notably from <a>Bihar</a>, <a>Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a>Orissa</a>.
By 1828 enrolment of students steeply rose to 400.
The obvious question, that then arose, was whether it would not be wiser for the Government of Bengal to establish a new 'English College' open to all classes and community of students.
The Committee of Managers of Hindu College had soon after the inception of the college become dependent on government subsidy, due to serious shortage of funds.
The government had began to play a greater role in the administration of the College.</p>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century the college had outgrown the plans made by its founders.
Not only did it attract an ever-increasing number of scholars from the province and the rest of the Bengal Presidency, but it had also introduced courses in <a>Law</a>, <a>Drawing</a>, and <a>Engineering</a>, which catered to the needs of all classes of students - Hindus as well as non-Hindus.
The government had also to consider whether this growing institution, spending a good deal of public money, could be retained as a non-governmental institution, particularly when Calcutta had no general college managed exclusively by the Council of Education.
When other towns in Bengal had government colleges, it was felt in official and non-official circles that Calcutta should also have one.</p>
<h3>From Hindu College to Presidency College</h3>
<p>The proposal to set up a new college called the Calcutta College, or the Metropolitan College, open to students from all communities had already been mooted, but this would have meant greater financial liability for the government, which would also have to provide it with a competent faculty.
A viable alternative seemed to be the conversion of Hindu College into a general institution open to all communities, managed by the government.
On 21 October 1853, <a>Lord Dalhousie</a>, the <a>Governor of Bengal</a>, suggested that</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The new name, 'Presidency', referred to the <a>Bengal Presidency</a>, which was the local administrative unit of <a>British India</a>.
Accordingly, the Committee of Management for Hindu College met for the last time on 11 January 1854.
The Court of Directors renamed the College as Presidency College.
The College started functioning on 15 June 1855.
The 'scholars' of the College Department of Hindu College were transferred to Presidency College and 101 new students were freshly admitted.
Of these 101 pupils, two were <a>Muslims</a>, while the rest were <a>Hindus</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the Civil Engineering College and Medical College, that were located nearby, were associated with Presidency College.
But with the formation of the University of Calcutta, also located close by, the Council of Education shelved plans for allowing the expansion of the these three premier institutions into a full fledged university.
The college was formally placed under the control of the <a>University of Calcutta</a> in 1857.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Presidency</h3>
<p>The college continued to grow rapidly after its renaming and relocation.
In 1856, it had 132 students on its rolls.
94 students were in the General Branch and 38 students were in the Legal Branch.
Of them, 82 students had paid tuition fees, 43 were scholarship holders, and 7 enjoyed free studentships.
The Legal Branch was given a measure of autonomy: its students were subject to examination by held by the branch itself.
Two years later Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay, a student of the Law Department earned the distinction of being one of the first two graduates in Arts of the University of Calcutta.
</p>
<p>The college became an institution preparing candidates for the <a>BA</a> examination under the aegis of Calcutta University.
At the first Entrance Examination, held in 1857, it sent 23 students.
The <a>MA</a> degree was conferred for the first time on six students of this college in 1863.</p>
<p>The College authorities were faced with space shortage even after the expansion of the Sanskrit College building.
The process for acquisition of land for building a separate building and grounds started in September 1865 and in 1870 the principal of the college submitted a plan for the construction of a new building on the premises where it is presently located.
The new building was opened on March 31, 1874 by the then <a>Lieutenant&#x2013;Governor</a> <a>Sir</a> <a>George Campbell</a> in the presence of His Excellency, the <a>Viceroy of India</a>.
The finishing touch was given by Babu <a>Nuffer Chandra Pal Chaudhuri</a>, who provided it with a turret clock, at a cost of nearly Rs. 5000 soon after the new building's inauguration.
Professor <a>J.
Sutcliffe</a> was the principal of the college when the new building was opened.
</p>
<p>The First Arts or F.A. Examination was introduced in 1861.
The first candidate to qualify in this examination from the college was Gooroodas Banerji, who later became the first Indian Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University.
The ever-increasing rolls of the college demonstrated the keen interest shown by students from all over the Bengal Presidency.
The prestigious award of Gilchrist Scholarship for pursuance of further studies in England went to students of this college for four successive years since its introduction in 1868.
Between 1868 and 1900, 25 students of the college were awarded the <a>Premchand Roychand</a> studentship, the highest honour for academic excellence awarded by Calcutta University.
The college soon expanded its premises and the present edifice was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 31 March 1874 in the presence of the Viceroy.</p>
<p>The construction of the new building was beneficial for the science departments which now had adequate space for holding classes and carrying out laboratory work.
The <a>chemistry</a> department introduced practical classes in the new building in 1875.
Engineering classes, until then held at the college, were discontinued in 1880 when the Shibpur Engineering College was set up.
In order to augment the Faculty of Science, a professorship in <a>Geology</a> was instituted in 1892.
The Department of Biology was founded eight years later and <a>Subodh Chandra Mahalanabish</a> was made a professor there.
The last two <a>decade</a>s of the nineteenth century saw the appointment of distinguished scholars to teaching positions in the college.
For instance, <a>H.M.Percival</a> joined in 1880, <a>Bipinvihary Gupta</a> in 1883, <a>Jagadish Chandra Bose</a> in 1885, <a>Prafulla Chandra Ray</a> in 1889, and <a>Manmohan Ghosh</a> in 1896.</p>
<p>In 1897 the colleges admitted female students for the first time.</p>
<p>The Baker Laboratory, named after <a>Edward Norman Baker</a>, the then Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, was formally opened on 20 January 1913 and the Departments of <a>Physics</a>, <a>Physiology</a>, <a>Botany</a> and <a>Geology</a> were transferred to the new establishment.
One of the biggest rooms in the Baker Laboratory accommodated the science <a>library</a> (the Peake Library, named after Professor <a>C.W. Peake</a>).
Commerce classes were started in 1903.</p>
<p>The outbreak of <a>World War I</a> in 1914 interrupted plans for the building of an additional <a>hostel</a> and other facilities but the college continued to cross important milestones in the advancement of teaching and higher learning.
New dimensions were added to the college with the reorganisation of the college library in 1908 and the introduction of a College Union in 1914.
The 1920s continued to see eminent teachers such as <a>Professor Wordsworth</a>, Professor Sterling, Professor Home and Dr. Harrison increase the reputation of the college.</p>
<h3>Presidency during the Indian freedom struggle</h3>
<p>During the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Civil Disobedience Movement J.R.Barrow was the principal of the college.
He set the highest standards of discipline and academic excellence, but also meted out punitive action to students participating in the National Movement.
His objective, of increasing the academic standards of the college and its reputation, however, was never in doubt, and he earned the deep respect and appreciation of teachers as well as students.
This was the period when the Oaten Affair, in which <a>Subhas Chandra Bose</a>, then a student of the college, insulted by Professor Oaten, happened.
Bose, responding angrily to a racial insult made by Oaten, had pushed the professor down the main building's staircase.</p>
<p>From the early 1930s, Indian principals headed the college, though the Education and English Department formally retained the services of <a>British</a> officers until 1943, <a>Professor Ahmed Ali</a>, the co-founder of the Indian Progressive Writers' Movement and Association (1933-36) and author of the famous<a>Twilight in Delhi</a> was the first Indian to be appointed Head of the English Department in 1944 upto 1947 when India was divided.
From the 1920s to the end of the 1940s the college remained an important centre of nationalist activities.
Throughout this period the college continued to enjoy a great deal of popularity and prestige in <em>bhadralok</em> society.</p>
<h3>Presidency after independence</h3>
<p>The college's continued presence in Bengal's higher education was evident in its predominance as an undergraduate and postgraduate institution even at the time of India's independence.
Before 1947 and soon after, especially in the 1950s the college was still the <em>numero uno</em> of Indian education.
Anybody who was somebody in India <em>had</em> to be a student of this college.
In 1956 the centenary celebrations of the college were organised.
The building in which the economics, political science and sociology departments as well as the Derozio Hall are presently located was built during the centenary celebrations under the stewardship of the then principal, Professor J.C. Sengupta.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s the college became a centre of leftist and then far-left politics.
Through the 1970s and 1980s the college fought off repeated attempts to control it from outside, especially by the government as well as dominant political parties.
A important change that was brought to the college in the post-independence period includes the appointment of Mamata Roy as the first woman principal of the college in 2005.

<h3>Becoming a University</h3>
<p>In 1972 an unsigned article was released by members of the college's faculty suggesting that the college should be given full university status.
It is an open secret that the author of the article was Professor Dipak Banerjee, the legendary professor of economics of the college.
The upgrading of the status of the college continued to be delayed through the 1970s.
Two education commissions set up by the Left Front government after 1977 recommended the granting of autonomy to the college, but the idea was opposed by teachers' bodies affiliated to same the ruling Left Front.
In 2007 the state government appointed a seven member committee to look into the possibility of upgrading the status of the college.
The report of the committee suggested that the state government should grant the college partial autonomy.
In 2009 the Governing Body of the college unanimosuly adopted the proposal that the college should be given full university status amidst protests and proposals brought by the Trinamool Congress that the college should be given full university status.
On 16 December 2009 the state government tabled a Bill, entitled the Presidency University Act, 2009, in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly which granted the college full university status.
It was stated in the Bill that once the college becomes a full university it will be renamed Presidency University.
On 19 March 2010 a new chapter was opened in the history of the college when the West Bengal Government passed the Presidency University Bill, 2009 in the State Legislative Assembly.
On 23 July 2010, the Government of West Bengal published the gazette notification completing all the legal formalities for becoming a University.
Amita Chatterjee, a retired professor of philosophy in <a>Jadavpur University</a>, has been appointed the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University on 5th October, 2010.
Once most prestigious course to adhere in India was Presidency College Mathemetics.
This is comparitvely small department providig the base to all other department from early age of the college.
Most notable student of this department was <a>Satyendra Nath Bose</a>.</p>
<h3>Department of Law</h3>
<p>The college until the beginning of the twentieth century had a separate Department of Law.
This was not one of its original departments, but as mentioned above it had been started soon after the inception of Hindu College.
Two of its more prominent students were <a>Bankim Chandra Chatterjee</a> and <a>HH</a> Maharaja Nripendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur of <a>Coochbehar</a>.</p>
<h3>Department of Physics</h3>
<p>This department is one of the most well known departments of the college.
The department has had as students or as teachers several eminent people, including <a>Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose</a>, <a>Satyendra Nath Bose</a>, <a>Meghnad Saha</a>,  <a>Ranadeb Chaudhuri</a>, <a>Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri</a>, <a>Bikash Sinha</a> and <a>Ashoke Sen</a>.
The Baker Laboratory and the Physics Lecture Theatre, in the majestic new building built in 1913 are two of the most famous features of the college.
Since 2004 the department started an autonomous post-graduate course in physics recognised by Calcutta University.
Earlier, the department's course in post graduate studies was carried out at the University College of Science and Technology of Calcutta University in Rajabazar.
On 27 February 2009, the department organized a one-day symposium on the 150th birth anniversary of Sir J.C. Bose.</p>
<h3>Department of Physiology</h3>
<p>This department was founded in 1900.
The first phase of the development of this department which coincided with the founding of physiology as a discipline in India took place between 1900 and 1913.
<a>Subodh Chandra Mahalanobis</a> returned to India from England in 1900 and joined the Bengal Education Service.
He was posted at Presidency College as the Head of the Department of Biology, which was at that time composed of Human Physiology and Botany, in the same year.
In 1902, study of Human Physiology started as a separate course at this college, which was officially recognized in 1903 by the University of Calcutta.
On the Founders&#x2019; Day, i.e. 20 January, in 1913, the new building for science subjects, later named as <a>Baker Laboratories</a>, was formally inaugurated and the Department of Human Physiology was shifted to the second floor of the new building.
In 1915, the Calcutta University started the M.Sc. in Human Physiology in this department.

<h2>Institutions that were started in Presidency</h2>
<p>This college, being the oldest educational institution in the country, boasts of a number of prestigious institutions of primary, secondary and higher learning that were started under its aegis.
</p>
<p>The <a>Hindu School</a>, initially the <em>pathshala</em> wing of Hindu College, was the college's school when it was established, although it is now independent.
The <a>Hare School</a> has been from the middle of the nineteenth century located inside the premises of the college and has been traditionally associated with it.
Its students used to complete their higher education in this college in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
A large majority of the students of these two schools came from the landed aristocracy and the urban upper middle classes.
The importance of these two schools is evident in a verse written by Phani Bhushan Chakrabarty, a former student of the college and the first Indian Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court.
He wrote: <em>Prathom jakhon collegey elam/Bollam bahabaharey/Aschi hotey Hindu-Hare/Koriney care kaharey</em> (When I first came to college,/I said, &quot;Oh!
Wow,/Have come from Hindu-Hare,/Don't care for the high-brow).
</p>
<p>The <a>Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur</a> was founded in this college as its engineering department.
It remained in the college from 1865 to 1879.
The <a>Indian Statistical Institute</a>, <a>Calcutta</a> was founded in the Statistical Laboratory of this college by <a>Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis</a> in 1931.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>The college is administered on a daily basis by a principal, a burser, a deputy controller of examinations and the respective heads of departments.
It offers several scholarships to meritorious students, such as B.C.Law Free Studentship (185), Book Prizes (50), Cash Prizes (33), FAEA Scholarships (5), Hindi Scholarship (6), Hostel Stipend (14), Lump Grant (9), Medals (19), National Scholarship (14), Presidency College Graduate Scholarships (6), T.S.Sterling Onetime Grant (17), T.S.Sterling Scholarships (16).</p>
<h3>Hostel facilities</h3>
<p>The college has two halls of residence, one each for boys and girls.
The boys hostel is the famous <a>Eden Hindu Hostel</a>, which was started in 1886.
It stands on Peary Charan Sarkar Street, which separates the college's premises to the south from the hostel, which is next to the central premises of the University of Calcutta, called the Ashutosh Shiksha Prangan, that includes the Ashutosh Building and Darbhanga Building.
After 1990, the college administration also built a girls' hostel in <a>Salt Lake</a> in Calcutta.</p>
<h2>Extra-Curricular activities</h2>
<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p>The Students' Union room is located behind the main building.
The Union has been active since the first half of the twentieth century.
It is run by a President and a General Secretary.
It plays a constructive role in the day-to-day running of the students' affairs.
It is pertinent to note that the Union has always been controlled by elected students' groups that seek to challenge and question policies framed and actions taken by the establishment, both inside and outside the college, especially at the state level.
In the first decade after independence, when the college was starting off as a centre of excellence, wholly managed by Indians, and more specifically by Bengalis, the Union was firmly in the hands of forces not always friendly towards the Students Federation (SF).
From the sixties until the end of the eighties, the Union was controlled by the Marxist-Leninists.
After a brief period of students' apathy and indifference towards politics in the late eighties, the Union, in 1989, came under the control of a loosely formed group called the Independents' Consolidation (IC), covertly formed by an assortment of progressive democratic elements, owing allegiance to left-of-center and Marxist-Leninist parties which are hostile to the <a>Students Federation of India</a> (SFI).
Barring a brief spell of a few years at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century, the IC has kept control of the student body.
The Union is now under the control of the SFI, which returned to power in 2009.</p>
<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>The college has a long history of excellence in sports, especially in cricket and lawn tennis.
Until date it has a strong cricket team.
Until the mid-1950s the college used to have a lawn tennis court to the west of the premises, which was later replaced by the new building housing the economics, political science and sociology departments as well the college's auditorium, Derozio Hall.
Until the mid-twentieth century the college's sporting facilties were managed and maintained by a Sports Secretary elected from the student body.
There is a table tennis board in the Junior Common Room of the college on the ground floor and a badminton court in a room close to the Student's Union Room.</p>
<p>The college has a long association with <a>Mohun Bagan AC</a>, the first Bengali football club, whose history is closely linked to the rise of the Indian national movement.
One of the preliminary matches played by Mohun Bagan was against Eden Hindu Hostel's team.
Some students of the college who had joined this club earlier invited Professor F.J. Row, a grammatologist, to visit the club ground, then at <a>Mohun Bagan Villa</a>, on the day it was founded, i.e. 15 August 1889.
At this occasion Row suggested that the Club could be called 'Athletic', due to its excellent infrustructural facilities.</p>
<p>In the 1970s the college organised a past vs.
present cricket match, where Shri Siddhartha Shankar Ray played for the former students of the college.</p>
<h3>Cultural events</h3>
<p>Presidency has an annual festival organised by the students union called the 'Milieu' which hosts events in which students of all other colleges and universities of West Bengal participate.
The events of the festival comprise of a wide variety of activities such as outdoor sports and literary events including debates and quizzes.
</p>
<h4>Debates</h4>
<p>The college always had a great tradition of debates.
Amartya Sen's first lecture entitled 'Bigyaponer Arthoniti' ('The Economics of Advertisement') was delivered at a debate organised by the Student's Union, when the Debate Secretary of the college was Barun De, soon after Sen joined the college in 1951.</p>
<h3>Canteen</h3>
<p>The college also has a students' canteen situated at the back of the main building, beyond the Students' Union room and next to the badminton Court.
In the 1940s the college's canteen was called &quot;Ray Babur Canteen&quot;.
A decade later in the 1950s the students of the college frequently visited the neighbouring <a>Coffee House</a>, on the lane that is now called <a>Bankim Chatterjee Street</a>, which soon became a hub of both academic and political activities and discussions and is now famous for its debates.
Several eminent academics of the second half of the twentieth century, many of whom joined the government and/or have or still are teaching in the finest world universities were regulars at the Coffee House.
Later, in the last quarter of the twentieth century, the students of the college began to return to the college's canteen, which has been run by Pramodda since the 1980s and is now called &quot;Pramoddar Canteen&quot;.
The canteen remains the most popular meeting place for the students of the college.
The Coffee House retains its popularity amongst Presidencians.</p>
<h2>Building and Grounds</h2>
<p>The main building, housing the English, History, Geography, Bengali and Philosophy Departments of the college, which also has a clock tower, was built in the nineteenth century and is representative of the architecture of the middle of that century.
It has a quadrangle in the middle, next to the central library of the college which is located on the ground floor.
The science building, which has the Physics Lecture Theatre in it, is situated to the south of the college premises and opens out on to Peary Charan Sarkar Street.
It was built in 1913.
The new building housing the Economics, Political Science and Sociology Departments and the Derozio Hall was built in 1956, while the newest building built to the west of the main building for the holding of post-graduate classes, was built in 1990.
