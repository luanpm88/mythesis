<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>State University of New York at Geneseo</strong>&#x2014;also known as <strong>SUNY Geneseo</strong>, <strong>Geneseo State</strong>, or, colloquially, <strong>Geneseo</strong>&#x2014;is located in <a>Geneseo</a>, <a>Livingston County</a>, <a>New York</a>.
It is a University College of the <a>State University of New York</a>.
The school was founded as the <strong>Wadsworth Normal and Training School</strong>, in 1871, and became a state <a>liberal arts college</a> in 1948.
It is a member of the <a>Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|Milne Library.</a>Geneseo is classified as a four-year public <a>liberal arts college</a> and is colloquially referred to by New Yorkers as the &quot;Ivy of the SUNYs&quot; or &quot;Harvard on the Hill&quot; because of its rigorous academic curriculum and its location atop a promontory on the western edge of the Finger Lakes region.
Geneseo has 48 undergraduate majors, six graduate programs (Master's only), and 25 interdisciplinary minors.
The most popular majors in descending order are education, business, the social sciences, biology, and psychology.</p>
<p>The student population is approximately 5,000, with a student/faculty ratio of 19:1 and an average class size of 25.
Nearly 90% of Geneseo's full time faculty holds a Ph.D. or other terminal degree.
Geneseo ranks number one in the nation for four-year graduation rates among comprehensive colleges and is currently tied for highest freshman retention rate out of any public college or university in New York.</p>
<h3>The Humanities and Core Curriculum</h3>
<p>One of the differentiating hallmarks of SUNY Geneseo's curriculum is the requirement that each student take two 4 credit survey courses in western humanities, in addition to a wide distribution of core courses in the arts and sciences.
&quot;Western Humanities 1&quot; and &quot;Western Humanities 2&quot;, as they are called, are taught by faculty members from various departments.
Individual course syllabi share many historical, philosophical, and literary texts with other courses creating a common knowledge base within the undergraduate student body.
A distribution of core courses in the humanities, languages, and sciences further ensures that Geneseo students are well versed in the liberal arts tradition of education.
The entire general education curriculum is outlined below and must be completed by students of all majors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 courses in Natural Sciences</li>
  <li>2 courses in Social Sciences</li>
  <li>2 courses in Fine Arts</li>
  <li>2 courses in Western Humanities</li>
  <li>1 course in Numeric/Symbolic Reasoning</li>

  <li>1 course in Critical Reading/Writing</li>
  <li>Competency within a Foreign Language</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>25% of Geneseo's students participate in study abroad programs, either through the College or the SUNY system.
One of Geneseo's most popular study abroad programs is its offering of the Humanities I course in either <a>Rome</a>, <a>Athens</a> or <a>New York City</a>, and the Humanities II course in either <a>Paris</a>, <a>Prague</a>, <a>El Sauce</a>, or at <a>Oxford University</a>.</p>
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>The current President of the College is <a>Christopher Dahl</a>, who is also a member of the English department faculty and teaches a course in British Romanticism every other fall semester.</p>
<h2>Admissions &amp; Statistics</h2>
<p>Geneseo has developed into a highly selective institution, being one of the most selective public colleges in the nation.
According to the college's admissions department there were almost 11,000 students who applied for 925 seats in the class of 2014.</p>
<p>For the class of 2013, The average <a>SAT</a> score (CR+M) was a 1340 and the average high school GPA was a 94.
The middle 50% of scores on the <a>ACT</a> exam of all admitted students ranged from 28&ndash;31.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 percent of this year&#x2019;s freshmen ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes - an all-time high for the College.</p>
<h2>National Distinction and Rankings</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|thumb|James B. Welles Hall </a> --&gt; [[Image:Sturges Hall at SUNY Geneseo.jpg|right|thumb|Sturges
Hall is Geneseo's landmark building, featuring a clocktower and [[carillon]].]]
In 2008 <a>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a> listed the college as the number one &quot;Best Value Public College&quot; in the nation for out-of-state students, and number six in the nation for in-state residents.
Geneseo has been distinguished in Kiglinger's Top Ten &quot;Best Value Public Colleges,&quot; both in and out-of-state since 2005.
<a>US News &amp; World Report</a>&#x2019;s 2005 edition of Guide to America&#x2019;s Best Colleges: Geneseo is ranked No. 12 in the category &#x201c;Best Universities-Master&#x2019;s&#x201d; for all colleges, public or private, in the northern region.
Geneseo is also ranked No. 2 among the top public universities in the north.
Geneseo was listed in the 2005 &#x201c;Fiske Guide to Colleges,&#x201d; a guide published annually by former New York Times Education Editor Edward B. Fiske.
In the Fiske guide, Geneseo is highlighted as a &#x201c;Best Buy&#x201d;  school, and is lauded for its academic programs, accessible professors and hometown atmosphere.
The <a>Princeton Review</a> profiled Geneseo in the 2005 edition of &#x201c;The Princeton Review&#x2019;s Guide to the Best 357 Colleges,&#x201d; and the college was ranked No. 3 on that publication&#x2019;s list of &#x201c;Best Bargains &#x2013; Public&#x201d; among all public colleges and universities nationwide.</p>
<p>Geneseo has been regularly profiled in the Princeton Review, Kiplinger's, Fiske, and US News and World Report in annual publications since 1985.
In 2008, Kiplinger's reported that SUNY Geneseo &quot;could just be the best public college you've never heard of&quot;, as the publication ranks it the #1 public school in the nation for the best valued &quot;first-rate education&quot; for out-of-state students.
U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine has named the State University of New York at Geneseo among 80 colleges and universities in the country with a strong commitment to undergraduate teaching.
The special list is contained in the magazine&#x2019;s 2010 rankings of the country&#x2019;s top colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Other national distinctions include recognitions from <a>Money Magazine</a> and <a>Yahoo!</a>
Internet Life's 100 &quot;most wired&quot; campuses list (#90 in 1998, #49 in 1999, and in 2000 the list was divided by type of school and Geneseo placed #82 in the &quot;larger universities&quot; category).</p>
<p>Recent recognition for Geneseo has also come in the <a>New York Times</a>.
In July 2006, the Times profiled 20 colleges and universities of &quot;established or rising scholarship&quot; which are fast becoming viable alternatives to <a>Ivy League</a> institutions.
In addition to its characterization of Geneseo as one of this country's &quot;hidden gems,&quot; the Times noted that the college is &quot;increasingly seen as a first choice for high achievers&quot; and further observed that as the &quot;most selective of SUNY's comprehensive colleges&quot;, Geneseo is fast becoming <a>New York</a>'s alternative for students who &quot;chose not to go to the Ivies&quot;.</p>
<p>The college itself considers <a>Boston College</a>, <a>Colgate University</a>, <a>Cornell University</a>, <a>Hamilton College</a>, and the <a>University of Rochester</a> as its primary competitors and claims that it ranks among the &quot;two or three most selective public undergraduate colleges in the nation&quot;.</p>
<h3>SUNY Rankings</h3>
<p>All SUNY schools are part of the same <a>university system</a>, the <a>State University of New York</a>.
Different schools are different in character, program, quality, and prestige.
Of all of the schools in the system, SUNY Geneseo and <a>Binghamton University</a> consistently rank the highest in national publications.
In the 2009 Kiplinger's report, for example, Geneseo and <a>Binghamton University</a> were rated first and second, respectively, for best value for out-of-state students on the 100 Public College Values list.
Binghamton is a doctoral-granting university and is ranked among like peers, and Geneseo is a master's-granting college.</p>
<h3>Phi Beta Kappa</h3>
<p>Geneseo has joined 270 colleges and universities in the nation with chapters of the oldest academic honor society in the United States, <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>.
SUNY's four university <em>centers</em> already had chapters; Geneseo's establishment of a chapter is significant because it was the first (and is currently the only) of New York's thirteen state university <em>colleges</em> to have received the honor.</p>
<p>The inaugural &#x03a6;&#x0392;&#x039a; class was inducted to Geneseo's Alpha-Gamma of New York chapter in April 2004.
The arboretum is used for both teaching and recreation.
It also contains a gazebo and the college's memorial to four alumni who died in the September 11, 2001 attack on the <a>World Trade Center</a> in <a>New York City</a>, a gift left behind by the Class of 2002 through the Senior Challenge program.</p>
<p>East of the Academic Quad up a slight hill is Geneseo's Main street that complements the quaint campus with a variety of shops, restaurants and bars that students frequent throughout the week.
Beyond Main Street is the historic village of Geneseo marked by Victorian architecture, well-kept mansions, fraternity and sorority houses as well as several nineteenth-century churches.</p>
<h3>Planned expansion</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Doty Hall</a> &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|thumb|Sketch for an athletics stadium that has been released from the Geneseo Athletics Master Plan.</a> --&gt; <em>The Lamron</em> reported that SUNY Geneseo plans to acquire and refurbish Doty Hall, one of its former buildings, and to demolish a currently underutilized structure, the Holcomb Campus School, in order to build an open air, artificial turf athletic stadium.</p>
<p><em>The Lamron</em> reports that SUNY Geneseo will acquire Doty Hall and update its electrical and plumbing systems, as well as modernizing the new workspace.
SUNY Geneseo will be collaborating with the building's current tenants, the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, who will maintain their center on the building's first floor.
SUNY Geneseo will move its Office of Admissions into the building as part of a new, more visible college welcome center.
Then the Center for International Students, the Hearing and Speech Clinic, and the Department of Communicative Disorders and Science will all move into Doty.
These moves will free up space in Sturges Hall and Erwin Hall, and reconnects a highly visible plot of land with the campus.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a turf playing field for Geneseo's soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse programs, Commencement will be held at the new stadium, eliminating the cost and hassle of annually erecting a temporary stadium in the B lot parking area.</p>
<h2>Traditions and campus culture</h2>
<p>Geneseo's students celebrate many longstanding traditions and campus legends.</p>
<h3>The Bronze Bear</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Bronze Bear Fountain is on Main Street.</a>
Just off campus, in the center of Main Street in Geneseo sits the famous Bronze Bear statue.
School legend has it that if a virgin ever graduates from Geneseo, the bear will come down off of the fountain and run away, never to be seen again.
&quot;The Bear&quot; also plays host to any number of spontaneous decorations and pranks throughout the academic year.
A story also circulates that one of the wealthy Wadsworth daughters saw the bear fountain in a small town in Germany, fell in love with it, bought it, and sent it back to Geneseo in the early 19th century.
This story is unverified, but an excerpt from a history of the family that settled the valley implies that this is not true, and that the fountain was designed and built for its current location: &quot;[Main Street] is still dominated by a drinking fountain for horses dedicated to Mrs. Emmeline Austin Wadsworth.
For some obscure reason its designer placed a short pole in its center on top of which sits a cunning little iron bear, who is generally known as 'Aunt Emmeline'&quot;.</p>
<h3>The Greek Tree</h3>
<p>In the Sturges quad, students from different Greek organizations sneak about late at night to paint a &quot;Greek tree.&quot;
[<a>http://www.geneseo.edu/~ago/photos/alumni/1980s/1980_ago_tree.jpg</a>].
There are so many layers of paint on the tree that the original contours of the bark and trunk are obscured.
Despite the years of paint, the tree continues to grow and produce leaves.
The exact date when this practice began is unknown, but alumni report that it began sporadically during the 1950s and became regular practice in the mid to late 1960s.</p>
<h3>The Seuss Spruce</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Seuss Spruce.</a>
Also in the Sturges quad is the famous &quot;Seuss Spruce,&quot; so called because it looks like a <a>Dr.
Seuss</a> illustration.
It is said that the tree's shape was due to being weighed down by ice and snow during a particularly tough winter, and now the tree simply grows in a crooked and slightly spiral shape.
Adding to the Seussian quality of the tree is the fact that the bottom branches &quot;fan out&quot; along the ground.</p>
<h3>Sunsets</h3>
<p>Sunsets on campus are also legendary, so much so that students and alumni say the sunset at Geneseo was once ranked by <em><a>National Geographic Magazine</a></em> as one of the top ten in the world.
This claim has been verified as false&#x2014;<em>National Geographic</em> publishes no such ranking&#x2014;but lives on in campus lore.
Just off the Sturges Quad there is a Gazebo providing panoramic views of the Genesee Valley and its sunsets.
As is tradition on many college campuses, it is said that a couple who kisses in the Gazebo at sunset is destined to be engaged and later wed.</p>
<h3>Ice hockey games</h3>
<p>[[Image:geneseohockey.jpg|right|thumb|A Geneseo Ice Knights hockey game at the [[Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena]].]]
In recent years, Men's Ice Hockey games in the <a>Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena</a> have become major campus events drawing sell-out crowds of students and community members.
A pep band has been formed and student groups often offer promotions, such as handing out noise makers to the capacity crowds.</p>
<h3>Alma mater</h3>
<p>The lyrics to the school song, sung at convocation, commencement, and other formal events are as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;poem&gt; Shine the sun down on her halls of wisdom, where memories linger and our thoughts remain Sing her praises out across the valley, that echoes our refrain: Geneseo!
Geneseo! send us on our way Geneseo!
Geneseo! with our life's work we'll repay.
&lt;/poem&gt;</p>
<p>An older and longer version of the <a>Alma Mater</a> from a 1929 student handbook has three verses and a chorus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;<em>Proudly it stands on the hillside so firm, with its banners floating on high.</em>&lt;BR&gt;
<em>The finest Normal in the land, for you we'll do or die.</em></p>
<p>&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
  <p>Chorus:&lt;br&gt; <em>Then cheer for Alma Mater, our foster mother dear.</em>&lt;BR&gt;
<em>May her sons and daughters ever, love her from year to year.</em>&lt;BR&gt; <em>May they her memory cherish--in duty never fail,</em>&lt;BR&gt; <em>Nor let her honor perish.
To Geneseo all hail!</em></p>
  <p>&lt;ol start=2&gt; &lt;li&gt;<em>Let us strive to all our standards raise in sport and studies too.</em>&lt;BR&gt;
<em>Show all the world we're fighting clean, in all that we may do.</em></p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;<em>Others may cheer for their orange and black, or to other colors be true.</em>&lt;BR&gt;
<em>But we shall ever hold out love, for you our white and blue.</em></p>
<p>&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>College seal and logotype</h2>
<p>The Geneseo college seal, featured in the infobox above, was unveiled in July 1968.
According the college's office of publications, the seal is a visual representation of the college's location and mission: &quot;The circular design features a flame from the torch of knowledge surrounded by leaves symbolic of the bucolic setting of SUNY Geneseo and its growth.
Both are atop waves symbolizing the historic Genesee River.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1986, the college designed a logo to &quot;provide the College with an identity mark that was more readily identifiable than the College Seal and was not meant to replace the College Seal.&quot;
Again drawing on the college's unique surroundings, &quot;the graphic underneath the word 'Geneseo' symbolizes the rolling and rural character of the surrounding Genesee Valley.&quot;
The <a>typeface</a> used in this logo, and in many other college publications, is <em>Galliard</em>.
