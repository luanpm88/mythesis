<p><strong>Tianjin University</strong> () is a national university under the direct administration of the <a>Ministry of Education</a> of <a>China</a>.
It is the first university in modern Chinese education history.
It was part of <strong>Peiyang University</strong> (Beiyang University) (; <a>pinyin</a>: B&#x011b;iy&#x00e1;ng D&#x00e0;x&#x00fa;e) in 1895.
In 1951, after restructuring, Peiyang University was renamed Tianjin University, and became one of the largest multidisciplinary engineering universities in China.
The University was one of the first 16 universities accredited by the State in 1959.
It is also among the first group of institutions of higher learning in the national &#x201c;<a>211-Project</a>&#x201d; to which priority is given in construction.
In order to carry out the &#x201c;21st Century Education Revitalizing Action Plan&#x201d;, in late 2000 the Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipality signed an agreement which aims to build Tianjin University into a world famous university in the 21st Century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Peiyang University logo</a> Peiyang University was founded on October 2, 1895, and it was the first Chinese university providing 4 year degree modern higher education.
The university modeled itself on the famous European and American institutions of higher learning and aimed to rejuvenate China by training qualified personnel with new scientific and technological knowledge.
In 1951, after restructuring, Peiyang University was renamed Tianjin University.</p>
<p>Peiyang University&#x2014;Tianjin University contributes greatly to the Chinese higher education.
In its early days, undergraduates had the right to directly pursue graduate study at Harvard or Yale without any entrance exams.
Its Law School, which is the first (and also the best at that time) Law School in modern China, was merged into Peking University and gave Peking University a fresh new start.
Peiyang's Department of Aeronautics was separated and developed into Beihang University.
And The Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, University of Science &amp; Technology Beijing, Tsinghua Univerity and Nankai University also have kin relationship with Tianjin University.</p>
