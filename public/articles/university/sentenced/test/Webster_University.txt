The negative publicity toward Glennon's segregationist policies led <a>Saint Louis University</a> to begin admitting <a>African American</a> students in summer 1944.
In fall 1945, Webster College responded to pressure by admitting Irene Thomas, a Catholic African-American woman from St. Louis, as a music major.</p>
