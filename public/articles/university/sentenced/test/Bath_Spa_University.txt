<p> <strong>Bath Spa University</strong> is a <a>university</a> based in, and around, <a>Bath</a>, <a>England</a>.
The institution was previously known as <strong>Bath College of Higher Education</strong>, and <strong>Bath Spa University College</strong>.It was upgraded to full university status in August 2005.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institution can trace its roots back to the foundation of the Bath School of Art in 1852, following the impact of the Great Exhibition of 1851.
In 1947 Bath Teacher Training College leased the <a>Newton Park</a> campus.
The present institution was formed in 1975 as <strong>Bath College of Higher Education</strong> by the merger of the Bath College of Education and Newton Park College of Education.
In 1992, the college was granted degree-awarding powers and in 1999 adopted the name <strong>Bath Spa University College</strong>.
In March 2005 the institution was granted university status, becoming Bath Spa University in August 2005.
It has since consistently ranked amongst the top 100 universities in the UK, generally placing somewhere in the 80s.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Newton Park</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The Newton Park campus of Bath Spa University</a> The Newton Park campus, located to the west of Bath near the village of <a>Newton Saint Loe</a>, is the largest of the university's three campuses.
It is here that the majority of courses are taught, with the exception of Art and Design and some of the PGCE courses.
The campus is based in <a>Newton Park</a> in grounds designed by <a>Capability Brown</a> and leased from the <a>Duchy of Cornwall</a>.
The site has a <a>lake</a>, <a>nature reserve</a>, <a>woodland</a> and <a>farmland</a>.</p>
<p>The campus has a new <a>Students' Union</a> building, which includes a large bar, a gym, a shop and office space.
The <a>library</a> building, which includes a book shop and stationery shop, has been updated and enlarged and includes new <a>IT</a> facilities.
A new refectory has opened and includes a restaurant and separate deli/coffee bar.
The University Theatre has opened in new buildings on the site of the old refectory.</p>
<p>This campus houses the <a>Michael Tippett</a> Centre which is the only purpose built concert hall in Bath.
As well as being used for teaching music, the centre is used for exhibitions, musical performances and plays.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Newton Park</a> The Newton Park Campus is home to the majority of the student accommodation, which consists of eight &quot;halls&quot;: Harrington, Hiscocks, Pope, Langton, Hungerford, Nevill, Temple and Sydney.
Harrington, Hiscocks and Pope are arguably the most sociable halls due to their kitchen layout that allows easy flow between each 'block'; however these halls have the smallest bedrooms.
Langton, Hungerford, Nevill and Temple boast the largest bedrooms as well as larger kitchens, however these halls are in need of updating in comparison with the others.
Temple has been upgraded to a higher standard than Langton, Nevill and Hungerford and also contains a small ex-warden's house: Temple House, which has been refurbished to high student housing standards.
Sydney is the newest building whose bedrooms are ensuite and of medium size, it also has the most up to date security with modern facilities.</p>
<h3>Sion Hill</h3>
<p>The Sion Hill campus is in the north of Bath, in the <a>Lansdown</a> district.
This campus houses the <a>Bath School of Art and Design</a> and Art and Design courses are taught here.
This campus is in landscaped grounds and gardens that originally belonged to a mansion house.
The building is equipped with studios, workshops, a library, a stationery and art materials shop, Students' Union offices and a refectory.</p>
<p>Until 2009, the University also owned the nearby <a>Somerset Place</a>.
The sale of this listed <a>Georgian</a> crescent was intended to finance a new campus in the city centre.
This development, alongside the Dyson School of Design Innovation, did not proceed due to planning issues relating to the chosen riverside site.</p>
<h3>Culverhay</h3>
<p>The third, and smallest, site is based in the Southdown area of Bath.
It is situated next to <a>Culverhay School</a> and was formerly the school's <a>Humanities</a> block.
The campus is the home to most of the University's <a>Postgraduate Certificate in Education</a> Secondary and Middle Years Education courses, including <a>History</a>, <a>Music</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Geography</a>, <a>Mathematics</a> and <a>Religious Education</a>.
Facilities at the campus are not as extensive as those found in Newton Park but there are <a>IT</a> facilities and a <a>common room</a>.</p>
<h3>Corsham Court</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Corsham Court</a> The University has established a new centre in <a>Corsham Court</a> after an absence of more than 20 years.
Corsham Court became the home of the Bath Academy of Art (now Bath School of Art and Design and part of the University) when its premises were destroyed during the Second World War.
<a>Walter Sickert</a>, who taught in that School was also a mentor to <a>Lord Methuen</a> RA, owner of the Court.
The centre will include development support for research projects, postgraduate and research studios and study areas for artists and designers undertaking Masters level study and Doctorates, facilities for project work for all undergraduate students, and a conference suite for the use of academic and support departments across the University.</p>
<h3>Dartmouth Avenue</h3>
<p>The university's School of Art and Design has established a new venture in Dartmouth Avenue.
The site was developed as a series of painting and media studios as well as a project space for year two students.
This was to offset the loss of space incurred with the sale of <a>Somerset Place</a>.
The site has been expanded into an adjoining building to accommodate creative studios and a second, larger, project space (the first now being predominantly used for life drawing classes).</p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<p><a>thumb|One of the &quot;Bright Orange Buses&quot; to the University</a> There are regular trains to <a>Bath Spa Station</a> which is on the main line served by, amongst others, <a>London</a>, <a>Reading</a>, <a>Swindon</a>, <a>Chippenham</a> and <a>Bristol</a>.
From the station <a>buses</a> run to each of the campuses on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The Newton Park campus is served by the SPA1/SPA2 services (advertised by <a>First</a> as the &quot;Bright Orange Buses&quot;), which run from the University to Bath city centre every twenty minutes during the day in term time.
On week-nights and Saturdays, the service runs until 3 am, allowing students to get home from Bath's nightclubs.
In the evenings and on Sundays and holidays, the bus only runs once an hour.</p>
<p>The Sion Hill campus is served by the 700 service which runs from the bus station.
For the Culverhay campus the 20a service runs from the bus station once an hour and the 10 service runs every 10&#x2013;20 minutes, again from the bus station.
There is also service 42 which runs from the nearby <a>Park and Ride</a> at Odd Down every 12&#x2013;15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Plans</h3>
<p>Plans have been proposed for the development of the university, most notably at Newton Park Campus where over a ten year period the student accommodation is to be demolished and new accommodation built in its place.
The existing buildings will be modified to deal with the influx of students expected in the next few years.</p>
