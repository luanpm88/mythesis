<p>  <strong>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</strong> () or <strong>BUET</strong> as it is commonly known, is a Public <a>Engineering</a> University in <a>Bangladesh</a>.
It is the oldest Engineering institution in the region, and is regarded as one of the top universities for technical education in Bangladesh.
The medium of instructions is English.</p>
<p>Every year, about 965 <a>student</a>s get enrolled in <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> programs to study <a>engineering</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>planning</a> and <a>science</a> in this institution.
The total number of <a>teacher</a>s is about 500.
The University has continued to expand over the last three <a>decade</a>s.
This includes the construction of new academic buildings, <a>auditorium</a> complex, halls of residence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> <strong>Dhaka Survey School</strong> was established in 1876 as a <a>survey</a> <a>school</a> for training <a>surveyor</a>s.
at Nalgola, in Old Dhaka to train surveyors for the then <a>Government</a> of <a>Bengal</a> of <a>British India</a>.
Later, generous grants from <a>Nawab Ahsanullah</a>, a renowned <a>Muslim</a> patron of Education and member of the <a>Nawab family of Dhaka</a> enabled it to expand as a full fledged <a>engineering</a> school.
<em>Ahsanullah School of Engineering</em> offered three-year <a>diploma</a> courses in <a>Civil Engineering</a>, <a>Electrical Engineering</a> and <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>.
In recognition of the generous financial contribution from the then <a>Nawab of Dhaka</a>, it was named after his father <a>Khwaja Ahsanullah</a>.
It was moved to its present premises in 1912.</p>
<p>After the <a>partition of India</a> in 1947, it was upgraded to <em>Ahsanullah Engineering College</em>, as a <a>Faculty</a> of <a>Engineering</a> under the <a>University of Dhaka</a>, offering four-year <a>bachelor's</a> courses in <a>Civil</a>, <a>Electrical</a>, <a>Mechanical</a>, <a>Chemical</a> and <a>Metallurgical Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In 1962, it was renamed as <em>East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology</em> (EPUET).
A partnership with the <em>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</em> (renamed <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a> in 1963) was forged, and professors from A&amp;M came to teach and to formulate the curriculum.
During this period, EPUET offered courses in Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Chemical engineering, and Architecture.</p>
<p>After the <a>liberation war</a> of 1971, <a>Bangladesh</a> became independent, and <em>EPUET</em> was renamed to <em>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</em>.</p>
<p>Several more departments to offer graduate and undergraduate courses in different subjects like:Naval Architecture &amp; Marine Engineering, Industrial &amp; Production Engineering, Petroleum &amp; Mineral Resources Engineering, Computer Science &amp; Engineering were included in the university at different times.</p>
<p>In 2007, BUET celebrated 60 years of engineering education in Bangladesh by arranging a series of programs and events.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:BUET monument 1.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Bengali Language Movement|Language movement]] monument in front of BUET]] <a>thumb|140px|left|Dr.

It has a modest-size campus with limited capacity for residence within walking distances of the academic buildings.
At present the campus occupies 76.85 <a>acre</a>s (311,000 m&#x00b2;) of land.
The academic area is confined in and around the old campus occupying 30.24 <a>acre</a>s (122,000 m&#x00b2;) of land defined by Shahid Sharani, Bakshi Bazar road and the <a>Asian Highway</a>.
This area accommodates five faculties, three institutes, the administrative building, the central <a>library</a>, main <a>sports</a> facilities, the <a>auditorium</a> complex, the BUET Club and eighty two small units of residential accommodation of <a>teacher</a>s, staff and employees and the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>'s quarter.</p>
