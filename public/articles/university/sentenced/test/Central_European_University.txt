<p><em>For other uses, see <a>European University (disambiguation)</a></em>  <strong>Central European University</strong> (CEU) is a graduate-level, English-language university offering degrees in the <a>social sciences</a>, <a>humanities</a>, <a>law</a>, <a>public policy</a>, <a>business management</a>, <a>environmental science</a>, and <a>mathematics</a>.
The university is located in <a>Budapest</a>, and is accredited in the <a>United States</a> and in <a>Hungary</a>.</p>
<p>CEU has more than 1500 students from 100 countries and 300 faculty members from more than 30 countries.
In 2005, university co-founder <a>George Soros</a> announced he was doubling the CEU's endowment to <a>&#x20ac;</a>400 million .</p>
<p>CEU has been recognized for its academic excellence in two surveys.
According to a study published by German newspaper <a>Die Zeit</a>, the CEU Department of <a>Political Science</a> is one of the best Political Science Departments in Europe.
Only four continental universities were ranked ahead of CEU in this study.
CEU Business School is consistently placed among the top 20 best <a>Business Schools</a> in Europe in the QS TOPMBA survey.
However, its rank decreased from 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; place in 2006 to 39&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in 2009 in four years, although it climbed back to 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; place in 2010.</p>
<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
<p>CEU was founded in 1991 in response to the fall of communism.
The founding vision was to create a university dedicated to examining the contemporary challenges of <a>open societies</a> and <a>democratization</a>.
The initial aim was to create a Western-modeled yet distinctly Central European institution that would foster inter-regional cooperation and educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region.</p>
<p>In its second decade, CEU broadened its focus from regional to global, with a special emphasis on <a>democratization</a> and <a>human rights</a> around the world.
CEU has since developed a distinct academic approach, combining regional studies with an international perspective, emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary research in order to generate new scholarship and policy initiatives, and to promote good governance and the rule of law.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>thumb|right||CEU Building</a> --&gt; CEU evolved from a series of lectures held in <a>Dubrovnik</a>, <a>Yugoslavia</a>, (now <a>Croatia</a>) before 1989.
The original idea was to create a Western-modeled university committed to examining the political, social and economic transitions in post-communist Europe and promoting the idea of open societies.</p>
<p>Today, CEU is an internationally recognized institution of higher education, serving as an advanced center for research, policy making and academic dialogue.
The university aims to prepare its graduates to become the next generation of civic leaders and scholars.
CEU been a pioneer in many fields: for example, it began the region's first master's degree programs in <a>gender studies</a> and <a>environmental sciences</a>.</p>
<p>CEU emphasizes the development of <a>open societies</a> in <a>Central and Eastern Europe</a> and the former Soviet Union by promoting a system of education in which ideas and policy initiatives are creatively, critically and comparatively examined and developed.
In response to the spread of <a>democracy</a> beyond <a>Central and Eastern Europe</a> and the former <a>Soviet Union</a>, CEU has extended its outreach and <a>financial aid</a> programs to certain areas of the developing world.</p>
<p>On 14 October 2007 <a>George Soros</a> stepped down as Chairman of CEU Board.
<a>Leon Botstein</a> (President of the <a>Bard College</a>, <a>New York</a>), who had previously served as the Vice-Chair of the Board, was elected as new Board Chairman for a two-year term.
George Soros is a Life-CEU Trustee and serves as Honorary Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2009 Rector Yehuda Elkana was succeeded by distinguished human rights leader and legal scholar <a>John Shattuck</a>.</p>
<h2>Legal Basis</h2>

In the <a>United States</a>, CEU is accredited by the <a>Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
