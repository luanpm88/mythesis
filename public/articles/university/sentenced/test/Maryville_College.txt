<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>Maryville College was founded as the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in 1819 by <a>Isaac L. Anderson</a>, a Presbyterian minister.
Anderson had founded a school, Union Academy, in nearby <a>Knox County</a>, before becoming minister at New Providence Presbyterian Church in Maryville.
He expressed to his fellow clergy the need for more ministers in the community, including a request to the Home Missionary Society and an appeal to divinity students at <a>Princeton University</a> in 1819.
The new seminary was intended to help fill this need for ministers.
It opened with a class of five men, and the new school was adopted by the Synod of Tennessee and formally named the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in October 1819.</p>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>In 2004, Maryville College was recognized by the <a>Race Relations Center of East Tennessee</a> for its history of &quot;contributing to improving the quality of life for all in East Tennessee&quot;.
Maryville College was racially integrated from its earliest days.
An ex-<a>slave</a> named George Erskine studied there in 1819, sponsored by the <a>Manumission</a> Society of Tennessee.
Erskine went on to preach during the 1820s and was formally ordained by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1829.</p>
<p>Maryville College was closed during the <a>Civil War</a>, but, upon reopening, it again admitted students regardless of race, assisted by the <a>Freedman's Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>When the State of Tennessee forced Maryville College to segregate in 1901, the College gave $25,000&#x2014;a little more than a tenth of its endowment at the time&#x2014;to Swift Memorial Institute, the College's sister school.
Swift was founded by William Henderson Franklin, the first African-American to graduate from Maryville College (1880).
His Institute educated black students during the era of imposed segregation.</p>
<p>After the <a>Brown v. Board of Education</a> decision, Maryville College immediately reenrolled African Americans.</p>
<p>In 1875 Maryville College conferred the first college degree to a woman in the state of Tennessee.
The recipient was Mary T. Wilson, the older sister of Samuel T. Wilson, who later served as president of the College from 1901 until 1930.</p>
