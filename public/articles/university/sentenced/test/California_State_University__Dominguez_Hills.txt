<p><strong>California State University, Dominguez Hills</strong> (abbreviated <strong>CSUDH</strong> or <strong>Cal State Dominguez Hills</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> located in the <a>Los Angeles</a> suburb of <a>Carson, California</a> and was founded in 1960.
The university is part of the <a>California State University</a> system.</p>
<h2>History of the university</h2>
<p>The foundation for CSUDH was built in 1960 when then <a>Governor</a> of <a>California</a> <a>Pat Brown</a> provided state funds to begin development on the school.
It was to be located in <a>Palos Verdes</a>, <a>California</a>, and known as <strong>South Bay State College</strong>.
In 1962 the tentative name was changed to  <strong>California State College at Palos Verdes</strong>.
In 1964  architect  <a>A.
Quincy Jones</a> designed a master plan for construction.
As the college had not yet been constructed, the first classes began to be taught in  1965 at the California Federal Savings Bank in <a>Palos Verdes Peninsula</a>, <a>California</a>.
The college began with an enrollment of 27 freshmen and 14 juniors.</p>
<p>In 1965 the designated location for the campus was moved to an area known as <a>Dominguez Hills</a> in Carson.
The campus sits on the historic <a>Rancho San Pedro</a>, the oldest land grant in the Los Angeles area.
The land was in the continuous possession of the Dominguez family through seven generations, from its concession to <a>Juan Jose Dominguez</a> in 1784 to its acquisition by the people of the state of California for the university.</p>
<p>The college was initially established in the wake of the 1965 <a>Watts Riots</a> as a response to community outcry over the lack of higher education opportunities in the largely <a>African American</a> suburbs of Los Angeles.
In 1966 this campus opened its doors.</p>
<p>In 1977 the <a>California Postsecondary Education Commission</a> endorsed the college trustees&#x2019; desire to change the name of the school.
The name was then changed from California State College, Dominguez Hills to California State University, Dominguez Hills.</p>
