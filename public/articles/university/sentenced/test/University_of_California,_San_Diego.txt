<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Star III, in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>  When the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned as first imagined by <a>Roger Revelle</a>, Director of Scripps, to start as a graduate school of science and engineering comparable in quality to <a>Caltech</a>.&lt;ref
name=Kerr&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of San Diego supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university  of mesa land on the coast near the Scripps Institute.
The Regents requested an additional gift of  of undeveloped mesa land northeast of Scripps, as well as  on the former site of <a>Camp Matthews</a>, but Revelle jeopardized the site selection by making public La Jolla's exclusive real estate practices antagonistic to minority racial and religious groups, angering local conservatives as well as UC Regent <a>Edwin W. Pauley</a>.&lt;ref
name=Kerr/&gt; UC President <a>Clark Kerr</a> satisfied San Diego city donors by changing the proposed name from University of California, La Jolla, to University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref
name=Kerr/&gt; The city voted in agreement to its part in 1958, and the UC approved construction of the new campus in 1960.
Because of the clash with Pauley, Revelle was not made chancellor&#x2014;<a>Herbert York</a>, first director of <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, was designated instead.&lt;ref
name=Kerr/&gt; York worked out the planning of the main campus according to the &quot;<a>Oxbridge</a>&quot; model, relying on many of Revelle's ideas.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>UCSD was the first general campus of the UC to be designed &quot;from the top down&quot; in terms of research emphasis.
<a>John Jay Hopkins</a> of <a>General Dynamics Corporation</a> donated one million dollars to be used for recruiting a founding faculty.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Harold Urey</a>, Nobel winner in Chemistry, was an early recruit to the faculty in 1958.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt; (Revelle and <a>Suess</a> published the first paper on the <a>Greenhouse effect</a> the year before.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;) <a>Maria Goeppert-Mayer</a> was appointed professor of physics in 1960; she later won the Nobel Prize in 1963.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;  The graduate division of the school opened in 1960 with 20 faculty in residence; instruction was offered in the fields of <a>physics</a>, <a>biology</a>, <a>chemistry</a> and <a>earth science</a>.
Classes initially met in the Scripps Institute.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt; </p>
<p>By 1963, new facilities on the mesa been finished for the School of Science and Engineering, and new buildings were under construction for Social Sciences and Humanities.
Ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired, and the whole site was designated the First College of the new campus.
York resigned as chancellor in 1963 and was replaced by <a>John Semple Galbraith</a> in 1964.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt; The campus accepted its first undergraduate class of 181 freshman in 1964, and was designated Revelle College the next year.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;&gt;Stadtman, Verne A. &quot;The University of California, 1868-1968,&quot; pages 407-411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Second College was also organized in 1964, on the land deeded by the federal government.
It was renamed John Muir College in April, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;<a>University of California History Digital Archives&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; UCSD Medical school also accepted its first students in 1966.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Political theorist <a>Herbert Marcuse</a> joined the faculty in 1965.
A champion of the <a>New Left</a>, he reportedly was the first protestor to occupy the administration building in a demonstration organized by his student, <a>Angela Davis</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Barberella&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>American Legion</a> offered to buy out the remainder of Marcuse's contract for $20,000; the Regents censured Chancellor McGill for defending Marcuse on the basis of <a>academic freedom</a>, but further action was averted after local leaders expressed support for Marcuse.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>Richard C. Atkinson</a>, chancellor from 1980-1995, strengthened UCSD's ties with the city of San Diego by encouraging <a>technology transfer</a> with developing companies, transforming San Diego into a world leader in technology-based industries.
Private giving rose from $15 million to nearly $50 million annually, faculty expanded by nearly 50%, and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students during his chancellorship.
In 1995, the quality of UCSD's graduate programs was ranked tenth in the nation by the National Research Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>UCSD is taking out a $40 million dollar loan against itself to offset $84.2 million in state budget cuts in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Notable research</h3>
<p>UCSD has made impacts including <a>global warming</a> research and the discovery of the <a>Keeling Curve</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>The
Keeling Curve legacy</a>&lt;/ref&gt; It invented a widely used computer language, <a>UCSD Pascal</a>,&lt;ref&gt;<a>UCSD Pascal Copyright</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>UCSD Pascal</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>The UCSD P-system museum</a>&lt;/ref&gt; which influenced the design of <a>Java</a>, as well as developed the <a>Network News Transfer Protocol</a> (NNTP).&lt;ref&gt;<a>NNTP</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
Early research activity, notably in the sciences, was integral to shaping the focus and culture of the university.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The university's main campus is located near the Pacific Ocean on  of coastal woodland within the city of San Diego's &quot;University Community&quot; planning area.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name=&quot;About UCSD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is a lab for energy innovation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Public art</h3>
<p></p>
<p>More than a dozen public art projects, part of the <a>Stuart Collection</a>, decorate the campus.
Perhaps the most famous of these is the <a>Sun God</a>, a large winged creature located near the Faculty Club.
Other Stuart Collection art includes a collection of <a>Stonehenge</a>-like stone blocks, a large coiling snake path, a building that flashes the names of vices and virtues in bright neon lights, and three metallic <a>Eucalyptus</a> trees, the Music Tree, the Literary Tree and the Third Tree commonly referred to as the Silent Tree.
One of the newest additions to the collection is Tim Hawkinson's giant teddy bear made of six boulders located in between the newly constructed <a>Calit2</a> buildings.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Calit2&quot;/&gt; Another notable campus sight are the graffiti tunnels of Mandeville Hall, a series of corridors that have been tagged with <a>graffiti</a> by generations of students over decades of use.
Students in the university's visual arts department also often create temporary public art installations as part of their coursework.
The university is also sponsoring a $56,000 <a>performance art</a> project to develop a sense of community at the sprawling campus.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2009, local San Diego artist Mario Torero was invited to create a mural called &quot;Chicano Legacy&quot; based on content suggested by UCSD Chicano students.
The mural was unveiled on October 14.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The mural is a $10,000 digital image on a  canvas mounted on the exterior of Peterson Hall.
It includes representations of Chicano civil rights leaders <a>Cesar Chavez</a> and <a>Dolores Huerta</a> as well as the signature kiosk structure at <a>Chicano Park</a>.&lt;ref
name=Berestein&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first mural mounted on a centrally located University-owned building to depict a minority group's history&#x2014;murals on the side of cooperatively-owned Ch&#x00e9; Caf&#x00e9; have shown minority civil rights leaders since its founding in 1980.&lt;ref
name=Berestein/&gt;</p>
<h3>Special facilities</h3>
<p>UCSD has the 5,000 animal <a>Birch Aquarium</a> and public museum, the <a>San Diego Supercomputer Center</a>, several large shake facilities including the world record holding <a>Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table</a> ,multiple open ocean <a>research vessels</a>, and a <a>sea port</a>.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>UCSD is one of the ten general campuses of the <a>University of California</a> system which is governed by a publicly-appointed 26-member <a>Board of Regents</a> and administered by a president whose office is located in <a>Oakland</a>, <a>California</a>.
<a>Mark Yudof</a> became the 19th president of the University system in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The board of regents appoint <a>chancellors</a> to serve as the chief administrative officer of each individual general campus.
<a>Marye Anne Fox</a> became the seventh chancellor of UCSD in 2004, succeeding <a>Robert C. Dynes</a> who served as President of the UC system from 2003 until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Chancellor Fox's total compensation was $401,091 for 2007&#x2013;2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The chancellor has an immediate staff of eight vice chancellors for academic affairs, research, marine sciences, student affairs, planning, external relations, business affairs, and health sciences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university operates on an <a>academic quarter system</a> with three primary academic quarters beginning in late September and ending in mid June.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p>UCSD has at least two distinct endowments; one controlled by the Regents and another controlled by a privately-appointed non-profit corporation called the UC San Diego Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the foundation received $121.8 million in support and managed assets worth $520.7 million in total.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2007, UCSD became the first university in the western region to top $1 billion in their eight-year fundraising campaign.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ucsdnews.ucsd.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>The campus's undergraduate population is represented by a formal <a>student government</a>, known as the Associated Students (ASUCSD) which was founded on 16 December 1964.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASUCSD
Minutes, 16 December 1964&lt;/ref&gt; By a student referendum it was abolished in 1972 and later reestablished in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;ASUCSD
Minutes, 24 May 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the ASUCSD passed a non-binding resolution calling on the University of California to <a>divest</a> from its investments in <a>South Africa</a> due to the South African government&#x2019;s institutionalized system of <a>apartheid</a>.
The UC subsequently divested from such holdings later that year, a move <a>Nelson Mandela</a> later pointed to as a catalyst to ending white-minority rule in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>https://www.msu.edu/~divest/apartheid.html</a>|South African Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; Each college has its own <a>student council</a> as well.&lt;ref
name=&quot;collegefaq&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The campus's graduate population is represented by the Graduate Student Association (GSA).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Association's membership comprises representatives from each of the graduate departments.
The number of representatives is proportional to the number of graduate students within that particular department.
Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching or research assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees, <a>UAW</a> Local 2865.</p>

The <a>National Science Foundation</a> has ranked UCSD first in the UC system and sixth in the nation in terms of Federal research expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 200 San Diego companies have been founded by UCSD faculty and alumni, and over 40% of the people employed in the San Diego biotechnology industry work in UCSD spin-offs.&lt;ref
name=&quot;UCSD Profile&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIRRIE&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Science Watch'' ranked UCSD the eighth most cited institution during the period 1995 to 2005 in the field of molecular biology and genetics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
</pre>
<p>UCSD also counts among its research centers the <a>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>, the <a>San Diego Supercomputer Center</a>, the <a>California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology</a>, and the Center for US-Mexican Studies.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Calit2&quot;&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Residential colleges</h3>
<p>UCSD's undergraduate division is organized into six <a>residential college</a>s.
The system is modeled off of the residential systems at <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>.
They each set their own general-education requirements as well as having their own administrative and advising staff and granting unique degrees and separate commencement ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In chronological order by date of foundation, the six colleges are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a>Revelle College</a>, founded in 1964 as First College, emphasizes a &quot;Renaissance education&quot; through the Humanities sequence which integrates history, literature, and philosophy.
It has highly structured requirements.</li>
<li><a>John Muir College</a>, founded in 1967 as Second College, emphasizes a &quot;spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice&quot; and offers loosely structured general-education requirements.</li>
<li><a>Thurgood Marshall College</a>, founded in 1970 as Third College, emphasizes &quot;scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of one's role in society&quot;.</li>
<li><a>Earl Warren College</a>, founded in 1974 as Fourth College, requires students to pursue a major of their choice while also requiring two &quot;programs of concentration&quot; in disciplines unrelated to each other and to their major &quot;toward a life in balance&quot;.</li>
<li><a>Eleanor Roosevelt College</a>, founded in 1988 as Fifth College, which focuses its core education program on a cross-cultural interdisciplinary course sequence entitled &quot;Making of the Modern World&quot;.</li>
<li><a>Sixth College</a>, founded in 2002 with a focus on &quot;historical and philosophical connections among culture, art and technology.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Students affiliate with a college based upon its particular philosophy and environment as majors are not exclusive to specific colleges.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
John Muir and Earl Warren enroll the largest number of undergraduate students followed by Thurgood Marshall, Revelle, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Sixth.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Each undergraduate college sets the requirements for awarding provost's honors and honors at graduation in addition to departmental honors and <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> honors.</p>
<h3>Extension</h3>
<p>UCSD Extension is the continuing education and public program branch of the university.&lt;ref
name=&quot;extension&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 50,000 enrolles per year are educated in the university's extension program.&lt;ref
name=&quot;extension&quot;/&gt; The Extension provides over 90 certificate programs and over 12 specialized study programs.&lt;ref
name=&quot;extension&quot;/&gt; Most courses are held evenings and weekends for the convenience to working adults on the main campus or at one of three off campus locations:the Extension Sorrento Mesa Center, the Extension Rancho Bernardo Center, and the Extension Mission Valley Center.&lt;ref
name=&quot;extension&quot;/&gt; The Extension program also includes online only classes.&lt;ref
name=extension/&gt; The UCSD Extension program is not affiliated with the UC Cooperative Extension program.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<h3>Charter school</h3>
<p>The <a>Preuss School</a> is a <a>charter school</a> established on the UCSD campus in 1999 to provide an intensive college preparatory curriculum for <a>low-income</a> students from the greater <a>San Diego</a> area.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Preuss school has been ranked as one of the top ten best high schools in the United States by <em>US News &amp; World Report.</em>&lt;ref&gt;

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Price Center, UCSD.jpg|thumb|[[Price
Center]]]] The main student hub is the <a>Price Center</a> located in the center of campus, just south of <a>Geisel Library</a>.
The Price Center offers a variety of services, places, and spaces, including restaurants, the central bookstore, movie theater, and various student organizations.
In the Spring of 2003, a Student Referendum was passed to expand the Price Center to nearly double the original size.
The <a>Price Center</a> East expansion was officially opened to the public on May 19, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There are also three campus centers that cultivate a sense of community among faculty, staff, and students: the <a>Cross-Cultural</a> Center, the <a>Women's Center</a>, and the <a>LGBT</a> Resource Center.
UCSD was the last UC campus to have such centers.
All three centers, especially the Cross-Cultural Center that was created first, were founded in the mid-1990s and were the result of student movements that demanded change despite opposition by the campus administration.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There is a music venue on the campus grounds of some fame called the <a>Ch&#x00e9; Caf&#x00e9;</a>, a collective organization serving multiple functions as an underground music venue, vegan food collective, center for grassroots organizations such as <a>Food Not Bombs</a>, and similar groups and activities.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Ch&#x00e9;

<p><a>left|thumb|The June 2007 Watermelon Drop, an annual tradition at Revelle College</a> The Associated Students also coordinates a wide variety of concerts and events during the year, including All Campus Dance, Bear Gardens, Loft Events, and the Sun God Festival.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The <a>Sun God Festival</a>, named after the <a>statue</a> created by <a>art</a>ist <a>Niki de Saint Phalle</a>, is the best-known of the festivals.
During the event, there are day long series of concerts, performances, free items, and celebration before the final free concert takes place in the evening.</p>
<p>Two other popular campus events include the Pumpkin Drop and the Watermelon Drop, which take place during <a>Halloween</a> and at the end of the third (Spring) <a>academic quarter</a>, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Watermelon Drop is one of the campus's oldest traditions, famously originating in 1965 from a physics exam question centering on the velocity on impact of a dropped object.
A group of intrigued students pursued that line of thought by dropping a watermelon from the top floor of Revelle's Urey Hall to measure the size of the resulting splat.
A variety of events surround the Watermelon Drop, including a pageant where an occasionally male but generally female &quot;Watermelon Queen&quot; is elected.
In 1979 the Queen rode to Urey Hall in a theatrical-prop sedan chair that had been knocking around the Revelle dorms for years.
The Pumpkin Drop is a similar event celebrated by the dropping of a large, candy-filled pumpkin from 11-story Tioga Hall, the tallest residential building on the Muir college campus.</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<p><em>For University-run media also see <a>UCSD TV</a>.</em>
The campus newspaper, operated independent of student funds, is the <a>UCSD Guardian</a>.
The campus also hosts a small independent radio station, <a>KSDT</a>, which no longer broadcasts over the airwaves, but still operates online.</p>
<p>One of the more controversial aspects of student life at UCSD is the student-run comedy paper, <a>The Koala</a>, a satirical paper often criticized for its provocative articles and drawings, which is also funded by the A.S.&lt;ref&gt;<a>FIRE - Student Humor Magazine Prosecuted for Parody at UCSD: University Decision Expected This Week&lt;!--

<p>In February 2010, members of <a>The Koala</a>, on their Student Run Television program &quot;Koala TV&quot; publicly supported the &quot;Compton Cookout&quot;, a controversial off-campus party mocking Black History Month that included UCSD fraternity members among the organizers.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>[[File:Ucsdtriton.jpg|left|thumb|Athletic mascot, the [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]]]  UCSD offers student participation in a wide range of sports including <a>swimming</a>, <a>water polo</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>crew</a>, <a>track and field athletics</a>, <a>fencing</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>baseball</a>, and <a>tennis</a>.
UCSD participates at the <a>NCAA's</a> <a>Division II</a> (DII) level in the <a>California Collegiate Athletic Association</a>, although water polo, fencing, and men's volleyball compete at the <a>Division I</a> level.
Before joining DII in 2000, the school participated at the <a>Division III</a> level and won numerous national championships.&lt;ref

<p>UCSD does not have an NCAA football team.</p>
<p>Until the 2007-2008 school year, UCSD was the only DII school that did not offer athletic <a>scholarship</a>s.
In 2005, the NCAA created a rule that made it mandatory for DII programs to award athletic grants; a measure was proposed to begin offering $500 &quot;grants-in-aid&quot; to all 600 intercollegiate athletes in order to meet this requirement.
In February 2007, a student <a>referendum</a> was passed with the largest vote in UCSD history, authorizing a $329 annual student fee to fund a raise in coaches' salaries, hire more trainers and provide all athletes with a $500 scholarship.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Yang Su&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2006-2007, UCSD's best season since moving to DII, 19 of 23 athletic programs qualified for post-season competition, including 17 to the NCAA Championships.
Eight of those teams finished in the top-5 in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>UCSD fields a number of <a>club sports</a> teams.
The UCSD <a>surfing</a> team has won the national title six times and is consistently rated one of the best surfing programs in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The UCSD <a>triathlon</a> team is continually one of the top triathlon teams in the nation.
In 2008, the women's triathlon team won the US collegiate national championship and UCSD athlete Amanda Felder was the Overall Nation Champion.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
UCSD also has sport clubs in <a>badminton</a>, <a>cycling</a>, <a>dancesport</a>, <a>dance</a> team, <a>equestrian</a>, <a>ice hockey</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>roller hockey</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>sailing</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>snow skiing</a>, <a>table tennis</a>, <a>ultimate</a>, <a>volleyball</a>, <a>water polo</a>, and <a>waterskiing</a>.&lt;ref

<p>The National Collegiate Scouting Association (NCSA) 2008 Collegiate Power Rankings&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; rate colleges and universities comprehensively based on student-athlete graduation rates, academic strength and athletic prowess of the university.
The institutions posted in the 2007 Power Rankings represent less than 6% of colleges and universities across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
UCSD placed 4th on the overall ranking list, trailing behind <a>Williams College</a>, <a>Amherst College</a>, and <a>Duke University</a>, and first on the Division II list.</p>
