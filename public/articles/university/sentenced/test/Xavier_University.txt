<p><strong>Xavier University</strong> ( ) is a <a>co-educational</a> <a>Jesuit</a> <a>university</a> in the <a>United States</a> located in <a>Cincinnati</a>, <a>Ohio</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xavier University was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the <a>Northwest Territory</a>, is the fourth oldest Jesuit University and sixth oldest Catholic university in the United States.
The school was founded in 1831 as a men's college in downtown <a>Cincinnati</a>, adjacent to <a>St.
Francis Xavier Church</a> on Sycamore Street.
The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint <a>Francis Xavier</a> by Bishop <a>Edward Fenwick</a>.
Upon Bishop <a>John Baptist Purcell</a>'s request, the <a>Society of Jesus</a> took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Spanish Catholic.
St. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current <a>North Avondale</a> location, about  north of downtown, after the purchase of  from the Avondale Athletic Club.
St. Xavier College and <a>St.
Xavier High School</a> officially split in 1919, though did not become financially independent until 1934.
The name of the school was changed a second time to its current name, Xavier University, in 1930.</p>
<p>The Williams College of Business was established in 1961 and Xavier's first Doctoral Program in Psychology was initiated in 1997.
Xavier fully admitted women in 1969, but women began attending the college in 1914 in the evening, weekend, and summer school divisions.
<a>Edgecliff College</a>, another Catholic college in Cincinnati, merged with Xavier University in 1980 due to financial troubles.</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of building projects have been completed on campus including the <a>Cintas Center</a> and the <a>Gallagher Student Center</a>.
Current projects include a new Williams College of Business and Learning Commons (open fall 2010), a new residence hall (open fall 2011), and a new classroom building (future project) as part of the James E. Hoff, S.J, Academic Quadrangle.
Hoff was the University's 33rd President, 1991-2000.
<a>Fr.
Michael J. Graham, S.J.</a>, Hoff's successor and 34th President, still serves Xavier today.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The Gallagher Student Center.</a>
The campus covers approximately  in the city of <a>Cincinnati</a> (<a>North Avondale</a> and <a>Evanston, OH</a>) and the City of <a>Norwood, OH</a> and features both residential and academic malls, flanked by the older west campus and by the expanding east campus.
At the center of campus are the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel.
Bellarmine Chapel's roof is in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, also known as a <a>saddle roof</a>, that will not collapse, even if the Chapel walls were removed.
The chapel is the home to the Bellarmine Catholic Parish in Cincinnati.</p>
<h3>Academic Mall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Bellarmine Chapel</a> Six buildings with <a>castle architecture</a> sit elevated overlooking Victory Parkway to the west and resemble a single fortress.
Adjacent to the Gallagher Student Center (north to south) is Science Row: Lindner Hall (Physics), Logan Hall (Chemistry) and Albers Hall (Biology).
Hinkle Hall, the oldest standing building on campus (1919), sits in the middle of this impressive chain and is a three-story Tudor-Gothic structure whose <a>turret</a>s were modeled after the Xavier Family Castle in <a>Navarre</a>, <a>Spain</a>.
It houses the departments of Math, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology.
Schmidt Hall sits next as the University&#x2019;s current Administration Building, followed by Edgecliff Hall.
Originally Alumni Science Hall (1919), it was renamed after the former <a>Edgecliff College</a> and is home to the Department of Music.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the mall to the east stands the tallest structure on campus, Schott Hall.
It houses the Office of Admission and Office of Financial Aid in addition to the Departments of Modern Languages, Classics, Communication Arts, Political Science/Sociology, Accountancy, Finance, and Management and Entrepreneurship.
Next (south to north) is McDonald Library followed by Alter Hall.
Alter is the main classroom building and  the home of the Office of the Registrar and the Bursar's Office.
Finally, Hailstones Hall, which is the current home of the Williams College of Business, is adjoined behind Alter to the east, so is not truly on the mall.
Alter and Hailstones are adjacent to Bellarmine Chapel.</p>
<h3>Residential Mall</h3>
<p>To the north of the Academic Mall and on the opposite side of the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel is the Residential Mall.
All four underclassmen residence halls are here.
Brockman Hall is due north of Gallagher and is an all-freshmen community-style residence where about 300 students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with their wing.
Diagonally north across the mall is Buenger Hall.
Buenger accommodates over 200 freshmen and sophomore athletes and honors students in suites.
Diagonally south across the mall from Brockman and due east of Gallagher are Kuhlman Hall and Husman Hall.
Kuhlman and Husman together house about 1,000 freshmen and sophomore students and feature suite style, where students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with another room.
Between Kuhlman, Husman, and Gallagher is what is commonly referred to as &quot;The Greenspace,&quot; a large open all-purpose area for students and events.</p>
<h3>West Campus</h3>
<p>On the opposite side of Victory Parkway from the Academic and Residential malls is west campus.
It is home to most of the athletics and recreational sports with facilities including Hayden Baseball Field, Corcoran Soccer Field, Schmidt Fieldhouse, Corbett Physical Education Building, and the O'Connor Sports Center.
St. Barbara Hall and the Armory are home to Xavier's ROTC.
Joseph Hall and Elet Hall are home to the School of Education and Department of Psychology.</p>
<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>The <a>Cintas Center</a>, where the <a>Musketeers</a> host their <a>basketball</a> games, is adjacent to the Residential Mall.
Besides the 10,250-seat arena, Cintas also includes the Hoff Student Dining Center, the Schiff Conference Center and the James and Caroline Duff Banquet Center.
Cintas is surrounded on all sides by several parking lots and, on the far east side, is the A. B. Cohen Center.
Cohen is the home to the Art Department and Xavier Art Gallery, as well as the School of Nursing and departments of Criminal Justice, Social Work, <a>Occupational Therapy</a>, Health Services Administration, and some of the offices of the School of Education.
South of Cohen is the McGrath Health and Counseling Center which marks the furthest east building on campus at Cleneay Avenue.
Cleneay, which turns into Hearld Avenue, heads west toward the center of campus.
South of Cintas is Flynn Hall which houses the Xavier Post Office and Campus Police.
Across from Flynn Hall is The Commons, which is an upper-class apartment building.
Apartments typically house four students with individual bedrooms, living room, two bathrooms, and full kitchen.</p>
<h3>Police</h3>
<p>Xavier's Campus Police Department is composed of 22 sworn personnel.
Each police officer at Xavier is state-certified as a police officer and has full arrest powers in the state of Ohio.
Campus Police are responsible for issuing parking tickets and citing students for underage consumption.</p>
<h2>Academics and demographics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The new Smith Hall, which houses the Williams College of Business.</a>
<a>thumb|right|Academic mall and Alter Hall</a> Xavier University offers 81 majors within the colleges of <em>Arts and Sciences</em>, <em>Social Sciences, Health and Education</em>, and the <em>Williams College of Business</em>.
A wide variety of minors and pre-professional programs, such as medicine, dentistry, law, pharmacy and veterinary medicine are also offered.
All students must complete the core curriculum.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students attending Xavier must complete a significant number of distribution requirements that are more commonly known as the Core Curriculum.
There are required courses in: <a>Theology</a>, <a>Philosophy</a>, <a>Mathematics</a>, <a>Fine Arts</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>Physical Science</a>, <a>Literature</a>, Foreign Language, and the <a>Social Sciences</a>.
The Core Curriculum is a confluence of <a>Jesuit</a> ideals, and <a>Great Books</a> rigors, known as <a>Ratio Studiorum</a>.
All graduates, upon completion of a Bachelor degree have read <a>The Republic</a>, <a>Discourse on Method</a>, and selections from the <a>Bible</a> among other original texts.</p>
<h3>Major requirements</h3>
<p>All undergraduate students are required to complete the Core Curriculum (see above) and comply with departmental requirements.
Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours).
Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18&#x2013;21 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare second major within the Williams College of Business).
Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College.
120 credit hours must be obtained to graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree, and all students must achieve a 2.0 GPA minimum in their major course of study.</p>
<p>Certain majors; such as <a>Politics Philosophy and the Public</a> (PPP), <a>Honors Bachelor of Arts</a> (HAB), and Philosophy require a written thesis and defense before a selected committee.
Philosophy also requires a written comprehensive exam.</p>
<h3>Grading scale</h3>
<p>In 2005 Xavier switched to the plus/minus grading system, after using the simpler A,B,C,D,F scale since the University's inception.
However, in addition to the standard letter grades, Xavier offers professors the option to assign various non-traditional grades, such as VF (Vanished Failure) for students who do not attend class regularly.
The university also offers students the option to &quot;Audit&quot; courses; that is, to take the class, but have any passing grade not computed into the student's Grade Point Average.</p>
<p>Xavier has also switched to a &quot;Quality-Point&quot; conversion scale to compute Grade Point Averages.
The Quality Points are assigned such that each 1/3 of a grade is the equivalent to 1/3 Quality Point per credit hour.
For example, a grade of B would rate 3 Quality Points per credit hour (thus, for a 3-hr course, the student would gain 9 Quality points), while a score of B+ would rate 3 and 1/3 Quality Points per credit hour (so that same 3-hr class would yield 10 Quality Points).
The total number of Quality Points earned is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted (excepting those officially Withdrawn from consideration &#x2013; where a grade of W was assigned) to compute the student's Grade Point Average.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Xavier has been recognized as one of the top ten &quot;Master's Universities&quot; in the <a>Midwest</a> for the last 14 years by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.
For 2010, it ranked third.</li>
<li>It has been named one of the best 366 colleges in the United States by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>.</li>

Xavier sports teams have several traditional rivalries with local universities, including the <a>University of Cincinnati</a> and the <a>University of Dayton</a>.</p>
<h4>Men's basketball</h4>
<p> The Xavier men's basketball team is perhaps the best known of the sports sponsored at Xavier.
The team has enjoyed considerable recent success, reaching the <a>Elite Eight</a> in the <a>NCAA tournament</a> in <a>2004</a> and <a>2008</a>.
Since 1985, every men's basketball player who has played as a senior has graduated with a degree.
Xavier is one of only two non-<a>BCS</a> schools to be listed among the top 20 most valuable programs in college basketball (the other being <a>UNLV</a>) according to <a>Forbes</a>.</p>
<h4>Football</h4>
<p> Xavier fielded an <a>NCAA Division I</a> <a>football</a> team until the 1973 season.
The absence of the team led to the creation of the popular t-shirt &quot;Xavier Football: Undefeated since 1973.&quot;</p>
<h4>Club Sports</h4>
<p>The club sports program is designed to serve the interests of Xavier University students, faculty, and staff in different sports and recreational activities.
These interests may be competitive, recreational and/or instructional in nature.</p>
<h4>Mascots</h4>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|Hayden Field seen from Hinkle Hall</a> Xavier is one of a handful of universities with two mascots.
D'Artagnan, the Musketeer, is the university's official mascot and is the origin of the school's nickname, The Xavier Musketeers.
The Musketeer concept was suggested in 1925 by the late Reverend Francis J. Finn, S.J.
The Blue Blob is a furry creature that has made several television and magazine appearances over the years, including a controversial PlayBoy appearance.
The Blue Blob has Bobble-Body dolls, Plush replicas, and T-shirts made in his likeness, and an annual Blue Blob Appreciation Night during the Musketeer's basketball season.
He most recently appeared on two ESPN Sports Center commercials with Pro Football Hall of Fame member Jim Kelly and Sports Center anchors Scott Van Pelt and John Anderson.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Most Xavier games can be heard on <a>WLW</a> or <a>WKRC-AM</a>.
WLW is also the flagship station of the University of <a>Cincinnati Bearcats</a> basketball games.
When both teams play the same night, Xavier games are aired on WKRC.
Joe Sunderman does the play-by-play and <a>Byron Larkin</a> does color commentary.
<a>Fox Sports Net Ohio</a> holds the local television rights to the Musketeers basketball games.
<a>Brad Johansen</a> does play-by-play and Steve Wolf is the analyst.
Over the air stations, <a>WCPO-TV</a> and <a>WSTR-TV</a>, have held the rights to Xavier games in the past.</p>
