<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The State Normal School in Fitchburg</a>Fitchburg State University was founded as the <strong>State Normal School in Fitchburg</strong> in 1894 by the <a>state legislature</a>.
Its first President was John G. Thompson (President 1895&#x2013;1920).
Initially a secondary education school for women (coeducation arrived in 1911), the Normal School was not authorized to grant Bachelor degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920&#x2013;1927), and during Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's (1927&#x2013;1945) tenure.
In 1932, that authorization was extended to all academic disciplines in Education.
At the same time, the name was changed to <strong>State Teachers College at Fitchburg</strong>.
Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's died while in office and was followed by Dr. William J. Sanders (1945&#x2013;1950) and  Ellis F. White (1950&#x2013;1953).</p>
<p>During Ralph H. Weston's (1953&#x2013;1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus.
That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to <strong>State College at Fitchburg</strong> and added degree programs outside of Education.
In 1965, the College's name evolved into <strong>Fitchburg State College</strong>.
James J. Hammond (1963&#x2013;1975) and Dr. Vincent J. Mara (1975&#x2013;2003) were the next two presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.
More recently, a new west wing was added to the Mara compound.</p>
<p>In the past five years, since Robert V. Antonucci (2003&#x2013;present) became president, the college has focused on enhancing its buildings and grounds as well as its programs.
The school has focused on renovations and rehabilitation of underused buildings and areas as opposed to extensive building, even though there has been some.
One notable building is the  campus police station (2008).
A new science building and renovation of the Condike Science building is in the works with construction slated to begin in 2011.</p>
<p>Continuing Education at Fitchburg State University began in 1915, with the first summer courses offered through the College.
Twenty years later, its first graduate programs were established.
In July 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to grant Fitchburg state university status and change its name to <strong>Fitchburg State University</strong>.
The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The college originally housed students in buildings that are now surrounding the alumni quad.</p>

<p>The campus has six residence halls, three of which have rooms in suites, two are designated as apartment-style living, and one has a normal dormitory layout.

<p>Aubuchon Hall, Mara Village, and Russell Towers are the three suite halls.

Recently, the Campus Mail Center moved to the bottom floor of the Mara Village Commons Building located within the Mara complex.</p>
<p>There are two apartment-style residence halls on campus: the Townhouse Apartments and the North Street Apartments.
Because of their layout, both of these halls are usually reserved for upperclassmen.
Each one of the 33 Townhouses is equipped with a combination living room/kitchen area, one-and-a-half baths, and individual bedrooms.
The North Street Apartment building was acquired in the summer of 2007 and consists of six apartments.

<p>Herlihy Hall is the smallest, and oldest, of the college's current residence halls but has the largest rooms.
It houses 150 students in a normal dormitory style (one long corridor with rooms off it), and has the luxury of being connected to the dining commons.

The $12 million expansion added 125 beds and allows 50% of the undergraduate population to live on campus.</p>
