<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>NKU history began in 1943, when an extension campus for the <a>University of Kentucky</a> was opened in <a>Covington, Kentucky</a>, known as the <strong>UK Northern Extension Center</strong>.
After 20 years in operation as an extension center for UK, it became its own college in 1968, when NKU was founded originally as <strong>Northern Kentucky State College</strong> (<strong>NKSC</strong>).
The following year, the <a>Salmon P. Chase College of Law</a>, formerly an independent law school in <a>Cincinnati</a>, merged with Northern Kentucky State College.
The main campus moved from Covington to <a>Highland Heights, Kentucky</a> in 1972.
NKSC awarded its first bachelor's degrees in May 1973.
Northern Kentucky State College was expanded and renamed to <strong>Northern Kentucky University</strong> in 1976.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>Since its founding in 1968 and elevation to university status in 1976, NKU has expanded with numerous construction projects, new colleges, and a much larger, more diverse student body.
The current president of NKU, Dr. James C. Votruba, is largely credited with transforming the image of the university since his arrival in 1997, helping to build NKU's reputation as a respected academic institution.
As part of Votruba's administration, the university has increased its admissions standards and improved the academic performance of its students.
NKU also launched a new university logo and branding effort in 2002.
In recent years, the university has also concentrated on the construction of new and improved facilities across campus.</p>
