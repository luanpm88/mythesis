<p>The long history of the University can be traced back to 1909, when the <a>Nanyang Institute</a> in Shanghai established a Shipping Management Section.
DMU was founded in 1953 through the merger of three <a>merchant marine</a> institutions: Shanghai Nautical College, the Northeast Navigation College and Fujian Navigation School.
At that time its name was <strong>Dalian Marine College</strong>, and it was the only maritime college in China.
In 1960, DMU was designated a national key institution of higher education.
