<p><strong>Manhattanville College</strong> is a private, <a>coeducational</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> offering undergraduate and graduate degrees, located in <a>Purchase, New York</a>.
Founded in 1841 it was known initially as Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart.
Manhattanville's mission is to &quot;educate students to become ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community.&quot;[<a>http://www.mville.edu</a>]</p>
<p>Approximately 1,700 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students attend Manhattanville.
Manhattanville students come from 76 countries and 48 states.
In accordance with the college's Portfolio System, which is the nation's oldest such system, undergraduate candidates must present: a freshman year assessment essay, a study plan outlining all course work counted toward the degree, a program evaluation essay giving both a rationale for course choices and an evaluation of the course, and specific examples of work in writing and research.</p>
<p>The architectural and administrative centerpiece of the Manhattanville campus, Reid Hall (1864) is named after Whitelaw Reid, owner of the New York Tribune.
On either side of Reid Hall stand academic buildings on one side and on the other residence halls around a central Quad designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the designer of Central Park.
The Manhattanville community regards the central Quad and buildings as representing the academic vision of the College&#x2019;s commitment to integrated learning and centered strengths.
Other historic buildings include Lady Chapel, the President&#x2019;s Cottage known as the Barbara Debs House, the old Stables, and Water Tower.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1837 the Academy of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic boarding school for girls, was founded in a three-story house on <a>Houston Street</a> on <a>Manhattan</a>'s <a>Lower East Side</a>.
The Academy relocated in 1841 to an area in the northwestern part of Manhattan Island on a hill overlooking the village of <a>Manhattanville</a>.
Destroyed by a fire in 1888, the Academy was rebuilt on the same foundation and continued to grow both in curriculum and physical size.
In March 1919, 76 years after its founding as an academy, Manhattanville was chartered as a college by the New York State Board of Regents, empowering it to grant both undergraduate and graduate degrees.
During the Depression and World War II, President Grace Cowardin Dammann, <a>RSCJ</a>, instilled in Manhattanville's students a keen awareness of social problems by encouraging them to spend one day a week working with children at the Barat Settlement in the Bowery and at Casita Maria in East Harlem.
Mother Dammann's widely published speech, &quot;Principles vs. Prejudice,&quot; inspired other colleges to break down racial barriers.
This speech and Mother Dammann&#x2019;s commitment to racial integration were frequently applauded by other leaders, including Sargent Shriver who in a speech he gave at a Baptist Church in Winnetka, Illinois, praised Mother Dammann for her visionary leadership.
Mother Dammann also instituted tenure and sabbaticals for faculty, enlisted staff and faculty in TIAA by contributing to their retirement, connected with national academic organizations, championed integrated learning, and promoted the importance of scholarship to teaching.</p>
<p>In 1952 under president Mother Eleanor O'Byrne, the college moved from its campus in Harlem [<a>http://www.citycollegefund.org/c1955.htm</a>] to suburban <a>Purchase</a> to the former estate of <a>Whitelaw Reid</a>, &quot;Ophir Hall.&quot;
The campus was sold to <a>City College of New York</a>.[<a>http://www.citycollegefund.org/c1955.htm</a>]
After becoming co-ed and secular in the late 1960s and early 70's the college faced a crisis of identity and some of its real-estate assets were liquidated.
Under the leadership of presidents Barbara Knowles Debs, Marcia Savage, and Richard Berman, Manhattanville underwent a strengthening of assets.
Its eleventh and current president is Molly Easo Smith.
Co-educational since 1969 and non-denominational in its governance since 1971, Manhattanville's original vision lives on in the tradition of service begun by the <a>Society of the Sacred Heart</a>, extending from the students to the global community through Manhattanville's mission to educate ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community.
RSCJs continue to serve on the College&#x2019;s Board and a few reside on campus.
The accomplishments of the Religious and their profound impact on the life of the College are celebrated annually through events such as a &#x201c;Founding Mothers Exhibit,&#x201d; and lectures on the College&#x2019;s engagement with civil rights and social action.
In 2010, as part of Inauguration ceremonies for President Smith, the College hosted an evening of Gregorian Chants, in honor of its Pius X School of Liturgical Music, which closed in 1969.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Manhattanville is located on a  wooded campus in Purchase, New York, on the former estate of <a>Ben Holladay</a>, and later, <a>Whitelaw Reid</a>.
The college originally purchased a larger tract of land, but sold segments to the <a>Keio Academy</a> and <a>Mastercard</a> in the 70's and 80's.
The centerpiece of the campus is a quadrangle designed in part by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, who was hired by Reid to landscape his estate.
The quad is bordered on its north end by <a>Reid Hall</a>, which occupies the footprint of Ben Holladay's Ophir Hall, which burnt down and was rebuilt by Whitelaw Reid as a massive granite <a>crenellated</a> mansion, built in 1895 to designs by <a>McKim, Mead &amp; White</a> and now known simply as &quot;the Castle.&quot;
Reid Hall was at one time a potential site for the United Nations, and its grounds were listed in the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1974.
On the northwest side of the quad is the Manhattanville library, with a full-time cafe.
There is also a graveyard on campus which contains the remains of nearly 50 nuns, a relic of the days of when it was a Catholic school known as Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart.
The historic Lady Chapel, with an unused crypt in its basement, and biology classroom in the Ohnell Environmental Park were designed by <a>Maya Lin</a>, who designed the <a>Vietnam War Memorial</a>.
Two other historic buildings, the President&#x2019;s Cottage, and Stables built of fieldstone, are part of the campus.
Stones from the dismantled Japan Pavilion at the New York World Fair, a gift from the Japanese government to the College, can be found around the President&#x2019;s Cottage.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Manhattanville is a highly ranked liberal arts institution, offering the four-year Bachelor of Arts degree to undergraduate students and the M.A. and Ed.
D. for graduate students.
There are 36 academic programs, and  students are also free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.
The most popular majors for undergraduates are business, management, psychology, communications, English and History <a>Manhattanville College History Department</a>.</p>
<p>In order to graduate, with an undergraduate degree, a student must complete 120 total credits, eight to twelve of which are typically part of a chosen major program although music, dance and theater, and education majors must follow special guidelines.
Other requirements for graduation include the completion of a &quot;Portfolio Program&quot; which requires four of five distribution specifications in a variety of academic fields enabling the students to achieve a well rounded liberal arts education, and the completion of a writing class or first-year seminar in writing.
Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in &quot;independent, sustained work,&quot; culminating in the production of a thesis.</p>
<h3>Pius X School of Liturgical Music</h3>
<p>The Pius X School of Liturgical Music was opened in 1916 as part of the College.
It was founded by Justine Ward, who had developed teaching methods for Gregorian chant emulating the techniques of the monks in <a>Solesmes</a>, and by Mother Georgia Stevens, RSCJ, a musician and <a>Roman Catholic</a> nun.
Faculty over the years included Ward, <a>Achille Bragers</a> and <a>Andre Mocquereau</a>.
Thousands of music teachers studied at the school, including <a>Cecilia Clare Bocard</a> and <a>Thomas Mark Liotta</a>.
The school's namesake was <a>Pope Pius X</a>, a devotee of sacred music who initiated reform of the <a>liturgy</a> in the 20th century.
The institute closed in 1969.
In 2010, a Gregorian Chant, held in Pius X Hall, as part of Inauguration festivities for the current President, saw a packed auditorium of alumni, students, and faculty.
A renewed focus on history at the College by President Smith has resulted in the revival of several signature traditions and a renewed focus on the community&#x2019;s shared commitment to ceremonial events, historic commemorations, and rich history of accomplishments in the field of music.

<h3>Publications</h3>
<p><strong>The Touchstone</strong> is the oldest newspaper serving the Manhattanville community.
The Right World View, a student-run publication, is funded by The Leadership Institute.
The national literary magazine <a>Inkwell</a> is also published at Manhattanville.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Manhattanville is a member of NCAA Division III, competing primarily in the <a>Freedom Conference</a> within the <a>Middle Atlantic Corporation</a> as well as in the ECAC West Conference (men's hockey) and ECAC East Conference (women's hockey).
The department has added seven teams since 2007 and currently sponsors 21 varsity sports: men's and women's basketball, cross country, hockey, indoor track, lacrosse, outdoor track, soccer and tennis; baseball, softball, men's golf, field hockey and women's volleyball.</p>
<p>The origin of the unique nickname is traced back to the winter of 1974 and Tim Cohane, Sr., the sports editor of Look Magazine for more than 20 years and the father of then men&#x2019;s basketball coach Tim Cohane.
When thinking of a school nickname for the former all-girl's school, Cohane, Sr. came up with a 16th century quote from Jeanne d&#x2019;Albret, the mother of Henry of Navarre (Henry IV): &#x201c;A vaillant coeur, rien impossible,&#x201d; translated into English as &#x201c;To the valiant of heart, nothing is impossible.&#x201d;
Attempting to capitalize on that inspiration, the Manhattanville programs adopted the distinctive slogan and have been known as the Valiants ever since.</p>
<p>Manhattanville has a rich history of athletic success at both the team and individual levels.
Thirteen different programs have combined to earn 75 conference championships, with 10 different teams contributing to the school's 25 NCAA Tournament appearances.
Individually, 22 Valiants have received All-American accolades, including at least one in each of the last 10 seasons.</p>
<p>The Valiant men's and women's hockey teams have consistently been among the best in the nation since their inceptions in 1999-00, receiving nearly consistent national rankings.
The women's hockey team has made the NCAA Tournament seven times and reached the NCAA Championship game on three occasions (2002, 2003, 2008), while receiving votes in 147 of the last 148 USCHO.com
Div.
III national polls since the start of the 2000-01 season - including three weeks as the top-ranked team in the country (Jan 12-26, 2004).
The men's team has made four NCAA Tournament appearances, including a Frozen Four berth in 2007, and has spent 103 of the last 115 weeks in the Top 15 of the USCHO.com
Div.
III poll since Nov. 8, 2004.
The Valiants first were ranked #1 in Division III on Jan. 17, 2005 and spent 11 straight weeks (Dec.
4, 2005-Feb.
12, 2006) atop the poll the following year, led by consensus Div.
III Player of the Year Andrew Gallant.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Manhattanville women's soccer team also earned a #23 ranking in the NSCAA Div.
III National poll on November 23, 2009, becoming the fifth Valiant program overall to earn a national ranking and the first non-hockey team at the school since the field hockey team was nationally ranked for five weeks in 2004.</p>
<p>The school has achieved unprecedented athletic success in recent years, winning 48 conference championships and making 19 NCAA Tournament appearances since 2003 as compared to 27 conference titles and six NCAA berths before that.
Fifteen of Manhattanville's 22 All-American selections have come since 2003 and 19 of the 22 have been awarded since 1999.</p>
