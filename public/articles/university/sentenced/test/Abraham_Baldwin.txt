<p> <strong>Abraham Baldwin</strong> (November 22, 1754<img> March 4, 1807) was an <a>American politician</a>, <a>Patriot</a>, and <a>Founding Father</a> from the <a>U.S. state</a> of <a>Georgia</a>.
Baldwin was a Georgia representative in the <a>Continental Congress</a> and served in the <a>United States House of Representatives</a> and <a>Senate</a> after the adoption of the <a>Constitution</a>.</p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Baldwin was born at <a>Guilford, Connecticut</a>.
He was the second son of a blacksmith who fathered 12 children by two wives.
Besides Abraham, several of the family attained distinction in life.
His sister Ruth Baldwin married the poet and diplomat <a>Joel Barlow</a>, and his half-brother <a>Henry Baldwin</a> became an <a>Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</a>.
Their ambitious father went heavily into debt to educate his children.</p>
<h2>Minister</h2>
<p>After attending a local village school, Abraham graduated from <a>Yale University</a> in nearby <a>New Haven, Connecticut</a> in 1772.
Three years later, he became a <a>minister</a> and tutor at the college.
He held that position until 1779, when he served as a <a>chaplain</a> in the <a>Connecticut Contingent</a> of the  <a>Continental Army</a>.
He did not see combat while with the Continental troops.</p>
<p>Two years later, he declined an offer from Yale for a divinity professorship.
Instead of resuming his ministerial or educational duties after the war, he turned to the study of law and in 1783 was admitted to the bar at <a>Fairfield</a>.</p>
<p>His remains are interred at <a>Rock Creek Cemetery</a>.</p>
<p>He has been honored by the <a>United States Postal Service</a> with a 7&#x00a2; <a>Great Americans series</a> <a>postage stamp</a>.</p>
<p>Baldwin County, Alabama, Baldwin County, Georgia, and <a>Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College</a> in <a>Tifton, Georgia</a> are named in his honor.</p>
