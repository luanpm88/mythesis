<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History 1872-1928</h3>
<p>The University of Toledo began in 1872 as a private arts and trades school offering painting and architectural drawing as its only subjects.
In the 125 years since, the university has grown into a comprehensive institution offering more than 250 undergraduate and graduate programs to more than 20,000 students from around the world.
</p>
<p>In a pamphlet published in 1868 entitled &quot;Toledo: Future Great City of the World&quot;, Jesup Scott articulated a dream that led him to <a>endow</a> what would become The University of Toledo.
He expressed his belief that the center of world commerce was moving westward and by 1900 would be located in Toledo.
To help realize this dream, in 1872 Scott donated 160 acres (647,000 m&#x00b2;) of land as an endowment for a university to train the city's young people.</p>
<p>The student newspaper, <em>The Collegian</em> was founded by Gloria Steinem's father, Leo Steinem, in 1918 Currently named <em><a>The Independent Collegian</a></em>, it is now one of the few collegiate newspapers in the country to be completely independent of its university.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, Toledo University was a growing institution, limited only by the buildings that housed it.
Classes were held in two downtown buildings, but both were too small.
In 1922, the university moved into an automobile mechanics training facility that had been constructed during <a>World War I</a> on the original Scott property.
While twice the size of the old buildings, this location was less than ideal.
Its limitations became evident when an enrollment increase of 32 percent in one year produced a critical shortage of classroom and office space.</p>
<p>The prospects for a new, permanent home for the institution improved in 1928 when Dr. Henry J. Doermann became president.
His first activity was to initiate plans for a new campus.
To pay for the proposed buildings, the city placed a <a>bond</a> <a>levy</a> before Toledo's voters.
An all-out campaign led to the levy's passage by a margin of 10,000 votes, just 11 months before the start of the <a>Great Depression</a>.
</p>
<p>A local architectural firm planned the new campus.
Dr. Doermann wanted the buildings to reflect the best design elements of the universities of Europe because he felt such architecture would inspire students.
It took 400 men less than one year to complete University Hall and the Field House in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> design, the entire university being an excellent example of this style.
Centennial Mall, the picturesque lawn area in the heart of campus, is one of the &quot;100 most beautifully landscaped places in the country&quot;, according to the <a>American Society of Landscape Architects</a>.
Only 22 college campuses are on the list.</p>
<h3>Student Protests in the 1960s and 1970s</h3>
<p>College students became more politically active in the 1960s.
The decade produced frequent student protests, including many at The University of Toledo.
Most of the UT protests were peaceful.
More serious protests by students opposed to the <a>war in Vietnam</a> did lead to several arrests.
In 1970, the campus remained peaceful following the deaths of four student protesters at <a>Kent State University</a>.</p>
<h3>Recent developments (1992-2008)</h3>
<p>The university continued to expand its physical environs in the 1990s.
A major expansion of the campus took place when UT renovated commercial buildings at Dorr Street and Secor Road for classrooms.
A new Academic Center and Residence Hall (1992) was built to house the Honors Program.
Other new buildings included the Student Medical Center (1992), the Center for the Visual Arts designed by the famous architect <a>Frank Gehry</a> next to the <a>Toledo Museum of Art</a> (1992), the International House Residence Hall (1995), which was also the university's first apartment-style residence hall, and Nitschke Hall (1995).
Construction began in 1995 on a Pharmacy, Chemistry and Life Sciences complex on the main campus (Wolfe Hall) and a <a>Lake Erie Research Center</a> at <a>Maumee Bay State Park</a>.
<a>University/Parks Trail</a>, a six mile (10&nbsp;km) <a>rail trail</a> which runs from the university to <a>Sylvania, Ohio</a>, was also constructed in 1995.<a>thumb|International
House and Parks Tower - Student Residences at the University of Toledo</a>Since the turn of the century, more on campus housing has been established.
In 2002 The Crossings opened its doors for the students to enjoy.
Shortly there after, Ottawa House East and Ottawa House West opened(2005) and in 2007, The Quad (Dowd, White and Nash Halls) endured a renovation and was also re-opened for use.
</p>
<p>Significant growth in the 1990s not only occurred in buildings, but also in technology.
The university joined OhioLINK, a statewide library network, in 1994.
Computer labs and hook-ups in dormitories and offices provided Internet access to most.
Technological improvements allowed students to register for classes and check their grades by phone, and the university established a homepage on the <a>World Wide Web</a>.
UT became one of ten universities to receive five separate eight-figure gifts &#x2014; two separate gifts of $100 million from Ambassador Walter Guinness to create the University Cancer Diagnosis Research Institute.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges facing higher education in the 1990s, The University of Toledo marked its 125th year in operation.
The institution grew from a small, private arts and trades school to become a large state-assisted university.
Many of its faculty and academic programs have worldwide reputations, and its campus is an architectural gem.
</p>
<p>After a protracted protest by students, staff, faculty and community members; the <a>board of trustees</a> of the university agreed to include <a>domestic partner</a> benefits in the <a>health care</a> portion of the contract for faculty and staff with an effective start date of April 1, 2006.
This development made the University of Toledo the first state university to begin covering domestic partners after the passage of Ohio Issue 1, several others had partner benefits before and continued them after the ban.
The protest gained momentum after November 2004, when issue 1 was voted into law as an Ohio <a>Constitutional amendment</a> but began over a decade earlier with the work of several faculty members.</p>
<p>On March 31, 2006, Governor <a>Bob Taft</a> signed House Bill 478, which merged the University of Toledo with the <a>Medical University of Ohio</a>.
The merger became effective on July 1, 2006.
The institution retained the University of Toledo name, and the former Medical University of Ohio facilities are referred to as the <a>Health Science Campus</a>.
Toledo became the third largest public university in Ohio in terms of its operating budget, as well as one of only 17 public universities in the country that has colleges of business, education, engineering, law, medicine and pharmacy.
As a result of this merger, the College of Pharmacy will be one of only 45 American Colleges of Pharmacy located in an academic health science center.
The college's &quot;<a>Future of Pharmacy</a>&quot; campaign (2008&#x2013;2010) was initiated to raise scholarship and equipment funds for the college's expansion into a new building on the health science campus, an expansion that will increase educational and research opportunities for students and faculty.</p>
<h2>The Wright Center for PVIC</h2>
<p>For more than 20 years, the University of Toledo (UT) has been involved with advancing solar cell science and technology and is internationally recognized as an academic leader.</p>
<p>UT has assembled a team of world class faculty whose research involved establishing science and technology platforms employing second and third generation photovoltaics (PV) materials and devices tailored for applications in clean electricity generation.
The three primary locations of the Wright Center for Photovoltaics Innovation and Commercialization (PVIC) include The University of Toledo, The Ohio State University, and Bowling Green State University.</p>
<p>The Center for PVIC is a State of Ohio Third Frontier supported Wright Center of Innovation was established through an Ohio Department of Development primary grant of $18.6 million to UT, and its mission is to stimulate the Ohio PV industry, to establish a full value chain of PV in Ohio, to generate new high-tech jobs, and to increase industry revenue.</p>
<p>The Center's research is focused on improving large area materials and devices, increasing the efficiency of solar technologies, and lowering production costs - with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of solar-powered electrical generation systems in homes, businesses, and utilities, as well as supporting the nation's defense and aerospace needs for advanced solar energy systems.</p>
<p>The Wright Center for PVIC is an internationally recognized PV research and development center with an infrastructure attractive to companies that are already successfully marketing PV as well as to companies that are incubating the future generations of PV devices.

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p> The University of Toledo, as of 2006, offers over 250 academic programs; all are a part of the University's 10 colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business and Innovation, Education, Engineering, Health Science and Human Service, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and <a>University of Toledo's University College</a>.
</p>
<p>In 2006, The Princeton Review named the University of Toledo College of Engineering Graduate School as the #18 engineering graduate school in the United States.</p>
<p>In the Spring Semester of 2007, President Lloyd Jacobs announced that the tuition for the 2007-2008 academic year would remain the same as it was in the 2006-2007 school year.
This was the first time in 33 years that the University of Toledo did not raise tuition costs.
This move was made to counter the statewide trend of steadily increasing four-year college tuition costs.</p>
<h2>Campus sustainability</h2>
<p>In April 2009, Aramark Higher Education, the dining service of the University of Toledo, launched the &#x201c;Green Stakes&#x201d; campaign.
The campaign will make dining more sustainable by using recycled products, using less water, offer more sustainable food options, and implement a re-use container program.
The university is also in the process of converting the Scott Park Campus to create a campus devoted solely to sustainable research, including a solar panel field and a series of wind turbines.</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>
<h3>University Hall</h3>
<p>President Henry J. Doermann, the father of the Bell Tower and the university's structural design, wanted all of the buildings on Bancroft Campus to be of a Collegiate Gothic architectural design to reflect the best design elements of the universities of Europe.
President Doermann felt such architecture would provide an atmosphere to inspire students.
He also dreamed of a central tower that could be spotted from anywhere on campus.
<a>thumb|University Hall - University Hall Bell Tower as seen from the student union.</a>President
Doermann went against the objections of many Toledoans who felt the design was too extravagant and a waste of money.
He knew how much this Tower would mean to the UT community; therefore, he set out and accomplished his lofty goal of building the beautiful high structure that resides at the north center part of Bancroft Campus.
Residing on the top four corners of this architectural gem are four gargoyles which overlook and guard The University of Toledo.
Completed in 1931, University Hall was the very first building built on Bancroft Campus.
It took 400 men, eleven months to complete University Hall and the second building built on campus, the Field House.
</p>
<p>The Collegiate Gothic structural design for University Hall set the standard for all other buildings to be constructed on The University of Toledo's Bancroft Campus.
The 156-step,  Bell Tower atop of University Hall serves as a constant reminder to all Rockets to accomplish their lofty goals and &quot;reach for the sky,&quot; just as President Doermann did in his life.
In order to honor President Doermann and his great dedication to the university, UT named the very theatre in University Hall in which he directed a theatrical production of Hamlet, Doermann theatre.</p>
<p>In 1940, Grace A. Snyder donated funds to purchase chimes for the tower of University Hall in memory of her husband, Walter B. Snyder.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x2026;We believe you are going to respond to the challenge of a beautiful environment, that the traditions which have grown up about this noble architecture will stimulate you to greater efforts in learning, and to finer decorum, and to a deeper resolve to use your education to further truth, justice and beauty.
This is our faith in you.&quot;
-UT President Henry J. Doermann, 1931, on the University's move the new campus on Bancroft Street</p>
<p>Overtime, the structure of the tower became a concern and the chimes were later removed.
They were replaced by an electronic system that gives the illusion of bells.
At 5 o&#x2019;clock every day, the system plays The University of Toledo fight song &#x201c;U of Toledo&#x201d;.
The tower has also been known to play other songs depending on the season.</p>
<h3>Centennial Mall</h3>
<p>During the Blizzard of 1978, the land in mid-campus, which used to be a faculty parking lot and Army barracks, was completely covered by snow.
Graduate students in the university's geography department conducted a study and, from the Bell Tower, photographed the paths on the snow made by students walking to class.
The design of the sidewalks in Centennial Mall was then constructed using the layout of those paths.
</p>
<p>At one point, there were 290 trees located in the  of Mall area.
The trees planted around the center circle were planted for each Mid-American Conference championship that a UT sports team accomplished.
This shrine of trees is known as the Circle of Champions.
Unfortunately, due to recent attacks by the Emerald Ash Borer and several other diseases, many of these trees have been taken down.
New trees have been planted not only all around Centennial Mall, but all around Main Campus as well.</p>
<p>Centennial Mall was completed in 1980 and provides the campus with an environmentally friendly look, which contributes to UT's ranking as one of the &quot;100 most beautifully landscaped places in the country,&quot; according to the American Society of Landscape Architects.
Only 22 college campuses are on the list.</p>
<h3>The Flatlands</h3>
<p>Past Rockets knew the Flatlands as the floodplain because the grass was hardly ever cut and it would constantly be flooded.
Rockets now use the Flatlands for many different purposes: playing volleyball, tossing a Frisbee or just laying out in the sun.
Many special events and traditions are held in the Flatlands each year such as live bands, tailgate parties, Traditions Night, Parents and Family Day Cookout, Homecoming Bonfire and painting the Spirit Rock.</p>
<h2>Monuments</h2>
<h3>University Seal</h3>
<p>On Oct. 23, 1995, The University of Toledo's Seal was dedicated and placed in the middle of Centennial Mall by the Student Alumni Council, with the support of various campus and community organizations.
</p>
<p>A tradition that was formally started by Omicron Delta Kappa, as part of their ritual, is that no Rockets past, present, or future who cross this path on their educational journey shall ever step on the seal.
This is every Rocket's sign of respect and gratitude for our great university.
It is a UT myth, and believed to be true, that if you step on the seal in Centennial Mall you will fail your next exam.
The seal was later raised so that no rocket could ever fail an exam due to this reason.
Recently there is a new myth that students should pass the seal on the right side, to symbolize that they are on the right path to a good education.
All students are encouraged to walk to the right of the seal and touch it with your hand as you walk by.
This is believed to give the student luck on their next exam.
The motto, &quot;Coadyuvando El Presente, Formando El Porvenir,&quot; is written on the Seal in Old Spanish.
It translates as &quot;Guide to the present, Moulder of the Future.&quot;
This is an original motto, written by Felipe Molina Larios, a former professor of Spanish at UT.
The four dates on the Seal represent significant dates in the history of The University of Toledo.
The University of Toledo was founded in 1872, became a municipal institution in 1884, became a state university in 1967, and merged with MUO in 2006.</p>
<h3>The Spirit Rock</h3>
<p>In 1968, Nicholson Concrete and Supply Co. donated an eight-ton rock to The University of Toledo as a symbol of spirit.
The Spirit Rock was originally located on the grass between the William S. Carlson Library and the Student Union.
The large rock marked the final resting place of the old Bancroft High image of The University of Toledo.
This symbol of spirit used to stand on end, but members of the varsity football team knocked the pride rock into its more permanent position on its side.
The current Spirit Rock on main campus was donated to the university in 1997 and placed in the Flatlands.
The original Spirit Rock, which was moved by the university in order to make room for the Student Union expansion, now resides by the pond at Scott Park Campus.Over the years, the rock has been a site for many Rocket pep rallies.
The Spirit Rocks have been tarred and feathered, burnt, and painted hundreds of times, including being turned into a pokeball, but it is tradition to only paint during twilight hours.</p>
<h3>Toledo Edison Memorial Fountain</h3>
<p>Toledo Edison Memorial Fountain, a gift to The University of Toledo by the Toledo Edison Co. for the Centennial of Light (1879&#x2013;1979), is located on the north side of the Student Union and was built when Centennial Mall was constructed in 1980.
Edison Fountain, designed by Toledoan Phyllis Nordin, adds a peaceful sound and look to the already very beautiful University of Toledo campus.
</p>
<p>The fountain was turned into a flowerbed for four years because the rusted pipes of the fountain would have cost $50,000 to repair.
After a fundraising effort by Student Government President Kevin Hopkins, Toledo Edison, and many others, in 1997, the flowerbed was restored back into a fountain.
</p>
<p>Soap in the fountain is a traditional prank played by a group of Rockets in the fall and spring semesters when the fountain begins running again.
WXUT 88.3 FM, the University of Toledo's official campus radio station, holds a contest in which students who swim around in the fountain fully clothed win prizes such as CDs, t-shirts, or away Rocket football tickets.</p>
<p>&quot;As Thomas A. Edison brought the light of electricity to mankind, This university brings the light of knowledge to its scholars.&quot;
- John P. Williamson, Chairman of Toledo Edison</p>
<h3>The Rocket</h3>
<p>In 1961, The University of Toledo procured a genuine rocket from the U.S. Army missile program, which was placed behind the crossbar of the north end goalpost, where the Larimer Athletic Complex resides today.
The University of Toledo's prideful piece of artillery was donated partially because of the university's affiliation with the Ordnance Corps of the U.S. Department of Army.</p>
<p>During the renovation in 1989-90, the rocket was moved to its present day position on the northeast corner of the Glass Bowl just outside of the wall.
The one-ton rocket carries two sets of fins and a propellant boost capable of guiding the missile to supersonic velocity.
</p>
<p>The trajectory of the rocket is pointed  south towards Bowling Green State University.
If the rocket were to be lit, it would blast-off and land directly on the 50-yard line of the Falcons' Doyt Perry football stadium.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<h3>UT-BG Ball Run</h3>
<p><a>thumb</a></p>
<p>On October 24, 1981, the residence hall staff of Carter Hall initiated a new tradition which accompanied the UT vs. BG football game.
The UT/BG Ball Run began as a staff unity project, but is now used to promote a &#x201c;good-spirit rivalry&#x201d; between Toledo and Bowling Green.
This tradition involves running a football 25 miles from the visiting team&#x2019;s campus to the home stadium of each year&#x2019;s battle.
The game ball switches many hands as numerous student organizations and individuals each run a mile in this annual charity fundraiser.
In the past, this marathon relay has been a competition against BG for the fastest time and most charity money raised by each team.
On October 5, 1996, UT&#x2019;s Chi Omega sorority began leading the annual run and then on November 23, 2001 The University of Toledo Student Government began to conduct the UT/BG Ball Run.
After Bowling Green's lack of participation from 2008-2010, The University of Toledo runs the game ball each year.</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>Homecoming is The University of Toledo's longest standing tradition and is cherished by Rockets of the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>The first University of Toledo Homecoming game was played on October 27, 1923 against Bowling Green Normal College.
In a historical milestone, Toledo won 27-0.
UT Alumni originally sponsored Homecoming as a means of stirring support and funds for their &quot;good old Alma Mater.&quot;
Homecoming is an annual event that encompasses a whole week of fun-filled events, which include such traditions as a pep rally, parade, bonfire, concerts, king and queen contest and the football game.
</p>
<p>The purpose of Homecoming Week is to bring together the university community, Toledo community, and university alumni in an effort to promote The University of Toledo.</p>
<h3>Song Fest</h3>
<p>Songfest, The University of Toledo's second longest standing tradition, began in 1937 as an outdoor singing festival to promote unity among Toledo's fraternities.
A group of six fraternities sang old college songs on the lawn behind University Hall at the first Songfest.
This musical tradition has brought together both campus and community through a night of entertainment.</p>
<p>Originally sponsored by the Inter-fraternity Council (then called the Panhellenic Council), Songfest began as a men's competition and was part of the annual May Day Celebration.
</p>
<p>In 1940, a women's competition sponsored by Peppers women's honorary was created.
The competition consisted of sororities and one independent group performing choral arrangements.
Songs were assigned to the groups and the members of each choir wore identical robes.
The men and women's Songfests existed as two separate competitions for many years .
</p>
<p>In 1948, the competitors were moved to the Peristyle at the Toledo Museum of Art and remained there until the 1960s.
The competitions were then held at various locations around campus including the Field House, the Student Union Auditorium, and Doermann Theatre.
In 1980, Songfest found its home at John F. Savage Hall, which was named Centennial Hall at the time.
The competitions were kept separate until 1965, when eight fraternities and five sororities participated together to form the tradition we now know as Songfest.
During the 1970s, many important changes occurred with Songfest.
The transition from the previous choral competition to the current production format occurred in 1972.
In 1975, Blue Key National Honor Fraternity replaced the Inter-fraternity Council as the co-sponsor of the event.
Coed student organizations first participated in this spring tradition in 1976 with such groups as residence hall, religious and professional organizations.
Currently, Blue Key International Honor Fraternity co-sponsors Songfest with Mortar Board National Collegiate Senior Honor Society every spring semester.
Various campus organizations participate in this event by performing song and dance routines that coincide with each year's particular theme.
Oftentimes these groups endure intense practices in order to showcase their talents in singing and dancing.
Performances are rated based on choreography, originality, harmony, creativity, and costumes.
</p>
<p>Songfest is also a chance for the University to recognize hardworking, outstanding individuals and organizations with campus-wide awards.
Blue Key and Mortar Board members are have been tapped at Songfest every year since the 1940s.
Songfest has continued to expand and flourish since its inception in 1937.</p>

<h3>Dance Marathon</h3>
<p>In 2002, Marlon Gibson with a team of dedicated students began Dance Marathon at The University of Toledo.
This is a tradition that began in Penn State and has been implemented at universities throughout the nation.
The first year dancer paid $100 to dance for 12 hours at the Student Recreation Center.
The night was filled with live entertainment, food and a line-dance that everyone learned throughout the night.
Dance Marathon 2002 raised over $18,000 for the Children&#x2019;s Miracle Network- Toledo Mercy Children&#x2019;s Hospital, the philanthropy of the organization.
Dance Marathon 2003 raised the minimum amount that dancers had to raise to $175.
The students ended up raising $32,000 for the charity.
In 2004, the amount of hours of the event was raised to 16 hours and the tradition was changed to an overnight event.
Dance Marathon ended up raising over $50,000 for the children in 2010.

<h3>Spring Week</h3>
<p>In 1968, Spring Weekend kicked off with former President William S. Carlson conducting a burial ceremony for the remains of Bancroft High School, a frequently used nickname for the University before becoming state affiliated.
A coffin and a plate of Carter Hall cafeteria food were set into the ground as a symbol of the passing of Bancroft High.
The original Spirit Rock occupied the approximate burial site between Carlson Library and the Student Union.
The old spirit is supposed to have been chased to South America.
Spring Weekend folded in 1971, but was revived in 1974 as Spring Week and included the SFE Raft Regatta on the Ottawa River, Spring Release held at Scott Park Campus, SAE Olympics, and many other events held in the Student Union, such as the attempt to break records from the Guinness Book of World Records.
The members of Omicron Delta Kappa organization took charge of the Spring Week tradition in the spring of 1996.
