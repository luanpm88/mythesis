<h2>History</h2>
<p>Both <a>Alfred University</a> and Alfred State College have their roots in an early teaching college called the Alfred Select School.
This school, under the leadership of the Seventh-Day Baptist church, was visionary in its equal opportunity policy.
In 1908 President <a>Boothe C. Davis</a> of Alfred University persuaded the New York State legislature to locate the New York State School of Agriculture at the Alfred University Campus; the resulting allocation of $75,000 for three buildings, a farm, livestock, and machinery would set plans for the school in motion.
In 1941 the school was given Junior College status, and renamed the New York State Agricultural and Technical College at Alfred.
</p>
<p>In 1948 the enrollment grew to such large numbers that the state government decided to allow it room to expand, moving the school across Main street from Alfred University, where it remains today.
In addition to a new campus would come greater autonomy, meaning that Alfred would now have two state-funded schools and one private university.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alfred State College and its neighbor <a>Alfred University</a> entered into merger talks that were eventually abandoned in the face of opposition from students, faculty, and alumni from both institutions, many of whom viewed the missions of the two colleges as largely incongruous.</p>
<h2>Schools and departments</h2>
<p>Alfred State College offers more than 70 majors in the arts, applied technology, and management and engineering technology.
Teaching staff  are in a 20:1 ratio to students, and are generally well-educated in their field, while maintaining ties to their profession.
</p>
<p>The college is divided into the following schools:</p>
<p><a>The School of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> <a>The School of Management &amp; Engineering Technology</a> <a>The School of Applied Technology</a></p>
<h2>Annual festivals</h2>
<p>In 1972 two students, Mark O'Meara and Eric &quot;Rick&quot; Vaughn, started a charity festival entitled &quot;<a>Hot Dog Day</a>&quot;.
This festival was to be a charity fundraiser for the area and would focus on the <a>hot dog</a>.
Now held in the third weekend of April, <a>Hot dog day</a> is a yearly celebration coordinated through both <a>Alfred University</a> and Alfred State College.
</p>
<p>Beginning in <a>Fall</a> 2008, Alfred State College will be hosting an annual <a>Homecoming</a> celebration, which will be held in part at the soon to be completed athletic complex.
This event is slated to be in tandem with Family Weekend, allowing for a weekend of fun for all.</p>

<h2>Facilities and construction</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: <a>thumb|250px|right|The John O. Hunter Student Development Center is home to numerous faculty offices, classrooms, and campus offices.</a>
--&gt;Founded with three buildings, a farm, and some livestock Alfred State College has expanded to include 12 residence halls, state of the art smart classrooms, a motorsports facility, a developing organic farm, the Orvis Activities Center, as well as a second campus of Applied Technology located in <a>Wellsville, NY</a>.</p>
<p>The trend that started in post-war Alfred has continued today in the multi-million dollar campus renewal program, including an all new athletic field that will accommodate Lacrosse, Soccer, Football, and will be surrounded by an 8-lane running track, an extensive renovation and expansion of Central Dining Hall, a 150-bed townhouse complex including a student activities center, as well as renovations of the School of Management &amp; Engineering Technology building.</p>
<p>Students enjoy food at two on campus snack bars (Exit West Cafe and The Peach Pit), Friendly's Cafe, Taco Bell Express, Freshen's Smoothies and Pretzels, KFC Express, Pizza Hut Express, as well as all-you-can-eat cafeteria style dining.</p>
<h2>Greek life</h2>
<p>Alfred State College has a long and valued history of <a>fraternities and sororities</a> on campus, starting in 1920 with its first fraternity.
Fraternities and Sororities contribute to the campus and community through philanthropic works, charitable contributions, and alumni interest in the college.
Pledging is a four week process requiring a minimum of ten hours of library time per pledging week amongst other requirements, hence the common phrase &quot;Four Weeks for Life&quot;.
</p>
<p>Currently four fraternities and three sororities are recognized by the college and Greek Senate: Kappa Sigma Epsilon (K&#x03a3;E) fraternity, Gamma Theta Gamma (&#x0393;&#x0398;&#x0393;) fraternity, Pi Rho Zeta (&#x03a0;&#x03a1;&#x0396;) fraternity, Mu Theta (&#x039c;&#x0398;) fraternity.
Alpha Beta Chi (ABX) sorority, Delta Chi Omega (&#x0394;&#x03a7;&#x03a9;) sorority, Pi Nu Epsilon (&#x03a0;NE) sorority and Alpha Sigma (&#x0391;&#x03a3;) sorority are all fully recognized by the College.
Recognized provisionally by the college, yet awaiting full recognition through Greek Senate: Psi Sigma Psi (&#x03a8;&#x03a3;&#x03a8;) sorority.
</p>
<p>Greek Senate has developed an autonomous Greek Judicial Board which allows for the full self-governance of the Alfred Greek System, adjudicating cases of organizational misconduct.
Hazing is not allowable by any organization on campus, but most especially in any fraternity or sorority.
Regardless of recognition status all members of the campus community are expected to abide by college policy and all applicable laws.</p>
