<h2>History</h2>
<p>  The University of Calcutta is the oldest of the modern universities in India.
It has so far produced 4 Nobelists, more than any other Indian university: <a>Ronald Ross</a>, <a>Rabindra Nath Tagore</a>, <a>C.
V. Raman</a> and <a>Amartya Sen</a>.
It was founded in 1857 during the administration of <a>Lord Canning</a>, the <a>Governor General of India</a>.
Dr <a>Fredrick John</a>, the education secretary to the then British Government in India, first tendered a proposal to the British Government in London for the establishment of a university in Calcutta, similar to London University, to create an educated class that would help them rule India; at that time the plan failed to obtain the necessary approval.
However, a proposal to establish two universities, one in Calcutta and the other in Bombay was later accepted in 1854 and the necessary authority was given.
The <a>Calcutta University Act</a> came into force on 24 January 1857 and a 41-member Senate was formed as the policy making body of the university.
When the university was first established it had a <a>catchment area</a> covering the area from <a>Lahore</a> to <a>Rangoon</a> (now in <a>Myanmar</a>) , and <a>Ceylon</a>, the largest of any Indian university.
In 1858, <a>Joddu Nath Bose</a> and <a>Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay</a> became the first graduates of the university.
On 30 January 1858, the Syndicate of the Calcutta University started functioning.
in  <a>Kapurthala</a> , <a>Punjab</a> province of <a>British India</a> became one of the first colleges to be affiliated with University of Calcutta.
Later <a>many institutions</a> came under its jurisdiction.
<a>Kadambini Ganguly</a> and <a>Chandramukhi Basu</a> became the first female graduates of the country in 1882.
The main campus is also known as the <em>Asutosh Siksha Prangan</em>, and contains Darbhanga Building, Asutosh Building, Hardinge Building, and the Centenary Building.
The <em>Rashbihari Siksha Prangan</em> (also known as University College of Science and Technology or popularly Rajabazar Science College), located on Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, houses several scientific and technological departments, e.g., pure and applied chemistry, pure and applied physics, applied mathematics, psychology, physiology, biophysics and molecular biology, to name but a few.</pre>
