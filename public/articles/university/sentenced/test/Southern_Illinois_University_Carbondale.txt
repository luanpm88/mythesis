<p></p>
<p><strong>Southern Illinois University Carbondale</strong> is the <a>flagship campus</a> of the <a>Southern Illinois University</a> system.
(The other members are <a>Southern Illinois University Edwardsville</a> and <a>Southern Illinois University School of Medicine</a>.)
Located in <a>Carbondale</a>, the university is known in official parlance as <strong>SIUC</strong> but colloquially as <strong>SIU</strong>.  SIU's total undergraduate enrollment is around 20,000.
Among public universities in Illinois awarding doctorate degrees, only the <a>University of Illinois</a> ranks higher.
Additionally, SIU is ranked by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> as &#x201c;Doctoral Research Extensive.&#x201d;
The University offers the full range of degree programs from the bachelor&#x2019;s to the doctoral level, as well as professional degrees in law and medicine.
It began with twelve academic departments and an initial class of 143.
The university continued as a teacher's college until Delyte W. Morris took office as president of the university in 1948.
Morris was SIU's longest serving president (1948&#x2013;1970).
During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine, and Dentistry.</p>
<p>In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.
This school, now known as <a>Southern Illinois University Edwardsville</a>, is now an independent university with the SIU system.</p>
<p>In 2005, then-SIU chancellor Walter Wendler unveiled a comprehensive plan called the Saluki Way, which will reshape the Carbondale campus over a 15-year period.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>On November 18, 2005, the SIU Board of Trustees unanimously selected former congressman and three-degree SIU alumnus <a>Glenn Poshard</a> to serve as the new President of Southern Illinois University.
Poshard took office in January 2006.</p>
<p>Southern Illinois University President Glenn Poshard announced Rita Hartung Cheng as the new chancellor of the Carbondale campus during a press conference on November 17, 2009.
Cheng took over from interim chancellor Samuel Goldman on June 1, 2010, inheriting the greatest budget crisis in the university's history, resulting in the elimination of many non-tenured teaching positions and mandatory furloughs for administrative personnel.
However, Cheng has come under fire for implementing these cost-cutting measures unilaterally, with no input from student or faculty advisory bodies.</p>
<h2>Academic programs and rankings</h2>
<p>Typical of public research universities, SIUC offers more than 170 academic degree programs across all levels; associates, bachelors, masters, and doctoral.
It also offers professional programs in <a>business</a>, <a>law</a> and <a>medicine</a>.
Since 1989, SIUC has offered an <a>MD/JD dual degree program</a>, leading to the concurrent award of both degrees after six years.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recognizes Southern Illinois University, Carbondale as an elite institution of higher education, based on breadth of research and academic programs.
Carnegie categorizes Southern as: &quot;RU/H: Research Universities (high research activity).&quot;</p>

<p>In 2009, Morris Library completed a massive renovation and expansion at a cost of $41 million with the architectural design team of PSA Dewberry and <a>Woollen, Molzan and Partners</a>.
The building&#x2019;s original fa&#x00e7;ade and the HVAC and elevator systems were completely replaced.
Every floor of the seven-story building was completely overhauled to drastically improve accessibility and remove confusion.

A 2.2-mile walk/run/bike trail surrounds the lake.</a>
The <a>Student Recreation Center</a>, or &quot;Rec,&quot; is the university's primary hub for intramural and fitness activities.
The  building is one of the largest of its kind in the United States on a college campus.
Access to the Recreational Center is free to all SIU students and for a membership fee to Alumni, Faculty and the general community.</p>
<p>Indoor facilities include a 880,000 gallon <a>natatorium</a> (home to the SIU Salukis swimming and diving team), two weight rooms, an aerobics room, martial arts room, a rock climbing wall, tennis court, racquetball courts, squash courts, volleyball courts, basketball courts, and two running tracks.

<h3>Health Center</h3>
<p>On February 3, 2006, SIU opened a new,  <a>health center</a> adjacent to the Recreational Center.
The $9.6 million dollar facility provides medical services to the university community and houses the medical clinic, pharmacy, wellness resources, mental health clinic, and sports medicine and physical therapy facilities.
Community partners Southern Illinois Dermatology and the Marion Eye Center also provide services in the new health center.</p>
<h3>The Saluki Way</h3>
<p>In 2005, former SIU chancellor Walter Wendler unveiled a massive plan to reshape the core of the Carbondale campus.
The plan, called &quot;<a>Saluki Way</a>,&quot; is a part of the larger &quot;<a>Southern at 150</a>&quot; project.
Saluki Way was approved in September 2006 by the SIU Board of Trustees and integrated into the university land use plan.</p>
<p>The $500 million plan is divided intro three phases and is expected to take 15 years to complete.</p>
<p>:*<strong>Phase 1:</strong> included construction of a new football stadium to replace <a>McAndrew Stadium</a> and renovations to <a>SIU Arena</a>, the home of the men's and women's basketball teams.
&lt;br&gt;On March 3, 2009 the official groundbreaking for the first phase of Saluki Way took place.
Shortly afterward, construction commenced on the new <a>Saluki Stadium</a>, athletic support building and renovations to the SIU Arena.
<a>Saluki Stadium</a> was completed in August 2010, and opened on September 2, 2010 for the inaugural game.
Construction of the athletic support facilities and renovations of the SIU Arena are scheduled for completion in late September/early October 2010.
The Salukis will play their first game in the &quot;new&quot; arena on November 1, 2010.
:*<strong>Phase 2:</strong> The second phase calls for the construction of new classroom buildings where the current football stadium is, re-routing roads and renovating existing structures.
Woody Hall, the university's hub for Student Services, will be moved to the new construction along with the Alumni reception center.
No timetable has been announced for this phase of the project.
:*<strong>Phase 3:</strong> The third phase of Saluki Way will include the building of new dormitories.
No timetable has been announced for this phase of the project.</p>
<p>The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams.
Most compete in the <a>Missouri Valley Conference</a> (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball.
The football program competes in the <a>Missouri Valley Football Conference</a> (MVFC).
Men's swimming is part of the <a>Mid-American Conference</a> (MAC).</p>

Students are considered to hold freshman status if they have earned fewer than 26 credit hours after high school.
These restrictions do not apply to students over the age of 21, veterans, married students, single parents, or students with 26 or more credit hours.</p>
<h3>Cardboard Boat Regatta</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.</a>
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake.
Participants include university students and community members both young and old.
The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats.
There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).</p>
<p>The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University.
Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class.
<a>Buckminster Fuller</a>, then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of &quot;doing the most with the least,&quot; and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes.
Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 20 years later, it is still happening.
Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.</p>
<h3>Competitive programs</h3>
