<p> <strong>California State University Channel Islands</strong> (<strong>CSUCI</strong>, known informally as CI) is a four-year public <a>university</a> located in <a>Camarillo, California</a>, in <a>Ventura County</a>.
CSUCI opened in 2002 as the 23rd campus in the <a>California State University</a> system, succeeding the Ventura County branch campus of <a>CSU Northridge</a>.
The campus had formerly been the <a>Camarillo State Mental Hospital</a> and has been the setting for various movies and music videos.
CSUCI is located midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles in Camarillo, California, just north of the Santa Monica Mountain range.
The campus is situated in a thriving economic region that is home to major industrial and <a>biotechnology</a> firms, <a>agricultural</a> operations, as well as several non-profit agencies and organizations.
Despite its name, the campus is not located on the <a>Channel Islands</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The first buildings of the campus were built in 1934 as part of President <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>&#x2019;s <a>New Deal</a> during the <a>Great Depression</a>, a public works project to house the <a>Camarillo State Mental Hospital</a> and provide for welfare.
The hospital operated from 1936&#x2013;1997, more than six decades.
</p>
<p>Planning for the University began in 1965, when State Senator <a>Robert J. Lagomarsino</a> co-authored Senate Bill 288 calling for establishment of a four-year public college in Ventura County, and Governor <a>Pat Brown</a> signed a bill authorizing a study for a state college for the county.
In 1974, Dr. Joyce Kennedy established the UC/CSU Ventura Learning Center.
She went on to serve as director of the <a>CSUN</a> Ventura Campus for more than fifteen years.
</p>
<p>In 1996, J. Handel Evans began as Planning President charged with beginning development of a public, four-year university in the region.
In September 1997, on the recommendation of the Chancellor and a community task force appointed by the Governor, the CSU Board of Trustees voted unanimously to accept the former Camarillo State Hospital site for the purpose of transforming it into the CSU&#x2019;s 23rd campus.
In July 1996, the CSU Board of Trustees formally adopted the name California State University Channel Islands for the new University.
In September 1997, Governor Wilson signed into law S.B. 623 (Jack O&#x2019;Connell) providing for the financing and support of the transition of the site for use as a university campus.
The state legislature and the CSU Board of Trustees provided funds to begin the conversion of the facility from a state hospital into a college campus.
In 1997, the hospital closed and the patients were moved into the state-local system.
In August 1999, The Ventura Learning Center moved to the Camarillo site as CSUN-CI, a satellite facility for <a>CSU Northridge</a>.</p>
<p>The school chose red and silver as their colors for the university.
The red is consistent with the tradition of the region, and the silver is for the dolphin, the University <a>mascot</a>.
The campus is situated on land inhabited by the historic<a>Chumash</a>.
They asked CSU Channel Islands to consider making its mascot the dolphin, which is cherished by the tribe.</p>
<p>The CSU Board of Trustees appointed Richard R. Rush as President of California State University Channel Islands and he started on June 18, 2001.
Dr. Rush&#x2019;s formal inauguration was held on April 19, 2002.
While establishing the University structures, Dr. Rush has overseen and participated in hiring of faculty and the university&#x2019;s senior staff.
In addition, he has directed the development of the university&#x2019;s strategic, academic, and physical master plans.
On August 16, 2002, CSUCI opened to upper division transfer students and in the fall of 2003, accepted its first freshman class.
As of January 2006, the first named school of the campus was the Martin V. Smith School of Business and Economics.
On May 17, 2007, CSUCI graduated its inaugural freshman class and received its initial accreditation for seven years, the maximum period allowed by the <a>WASC</a>.
The campus is under continuing construction to accommodate the projected growth of the university.
While there are about 3,500 registered students, projected enrollment for the year 2025 is 15,000 full-time students.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Bell Tower houses a majority of campus classrooms.</a>
The campus is located about two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the city of Camarillo.
The campus is bordered by farms along one side and mountains on the other.
Gaining official possession of the land in 1998 and then occupancy in 1999, California State University began classes on the  existing campus-style facility, primarily one to two-story buildings organized around three primary quads.
In 2007, the campus acquired an additional .
Many of the buildings are in the <a>Mission Revival</a> and <a>Spanish Colonial Revival</a> architectural styles, although there are a few &quot;modern&quot; buildings.
The campus is split into two primary sections: North Quad and South Quad.
Quite a few of the buildings in the North Quad are still uninhabited and unsafe due to age.
<a>CSUCI Campus Map</a>  Recently, <a>The Biggest Loser</a>  held a marathon along the southern road to campus, which caused traffic and disruption.</p>
<h3>North Quad</h3>
<p>The North Quad buildings are widely undeveloped, but have a few usable classrooms.
Solano and Manzanita Halls are relatively new additions to the campus, adding classrooms for the nursing program and other various classes.
Placer Hall is home to the University Public Safety and Parking Services and is located next to the Business School.
It dispenses permits to visitors.
Napa Hall, which includes the Mike Curb Studios opened in 2010, has classrooms for art and design students.
Finally, the University Hall is where the President's Office is located along with various other administrative departments.
Renovation and construction on the North Quad's newest Hall, North Hall, began with a groundbreaking in Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Because the North Quad is relatively empty, it is a popular destination for ghost hunting by students and locals.
The middle of the quad has a large and unique stage that is utilized for numerous school functions.
In 2009, it was used for the Student Programming Board's annual picnic, as well as the President's dinner.</p>
<p>The annual Student picnic bands that performed:</p>

  <li>2009: John West and <a>Cute is What We Aim For</a></li>
  <li>2010: Ray Fresco and <a>Sum 41</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Martin V. Smith Center for Integrative Decision-Making</h4>
<p><a>Martin V. (&quot;Bud&quot;) Smith</a> donated eight million dollars to finance the construction of California State University Channel Islands.
The first school on campus was named in his honor.

The Bell Tower can be seen from most areas on campus, because of it height and centrality.
The Islands Caf&#x00e9;, the dining services area, is located on campus near the South Quad, off University Drive.
Currently, the company Sodexo, runs the cafe but, in the next few years, the school will use a school-wide card for students in housing, to buy food from everywhere on campus, including the Student Union and the Town Center behind the Library.</p>
<p>In 2006, Channel Islands students passed a referendum to fund the design, construction and operation of the new Student Union.
The  Student Union includes a large programmable area for student events and live entertainment; a dining center with a coffee shop, pizzeria, sandwich deli and salad bar; lounges for informal gatherings; a game room, pool tables and computer gaming systems; and ASI offices for Student Government, Student Programming Board, The Nautical Yearbook, and the Channel Islands View (CI View) student newspaper.
The Student Union also includes a courtyard for outdoor events and gatherings for the entire campus community.</p>
<h3>John Spoor Broome Library</h3>
<p>The John Spoor Broome Library was designed by architect <a>Lord Norman Foster</a> and named after the first major donor to campus, <a>John &quot;Jack&quot; Spoor Broome</a>, an Oxnard rancher and philanthropist.
The library opened on April 4, 2008.
It is one of the few buildings on the campus that does not represent the Spanish mission style.
This  complex, which is twelve times large than the previous library, is home to 75,000 books, 180,000 electronic books, and 32,000 images of art.
It also complements the campus sustainability plan by using recyclable carpeting, natural lighting and combining the new structure with the existing buildings surrounding it.
Students claim that the old mental hospital's morgue is located under the library.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2002, former Congressman Robert J. Lagomarsino and his wife, Norma, established the Robert J. and Norma M. Lagomarsino Department of Archives and Special Collections, which is housed within the library.
Lagomarsino, a native of Ventura County, served as mayor of Ojai in 1958, as a state senator from 1961&#x2013;1974, and later, as a United States congressman from 1974 to 1992.</p>
