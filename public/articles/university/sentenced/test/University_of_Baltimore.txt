<p>The <strong>University of Baltimore</strong> (UB), located in <a>downtown</a> <a>Baltimore, Maryland</a> in the <a>Mt.
Vernon</a> neighborhood at 1420 <a>N.
Charles Street</a>, is part of the <a>University System of Maryland</a>.
Through the <em>Freshman Initiative</em> or <em>Lower Division Initiative,</em> UB has transformed from an upper division university to a traditional university.
In addition, the University has changed the school colors to <a>blue</a> (PMS 3025) and <a>green</a> (PMS 362), updated the &quot;UB&quot; logo, and adopted the new slogan-- &quot;Knowledge that works&quot;.</p>
<h3>Lower division Initiative</h3>
<p>The <em>Lower Division Initiative</em> is a program that began in 2005 to extend the University of Baltimore's current position to once again offer the first two years of the baccalaureate degree.
In April 2005 the <a>University System of Maryland</a>'s Board of Regents approved plans that would allow UB to start accepting freshmen and sophomores.
Under the original plan, freshmen and sophomore would be admitted starting in the fall of 2006.</p>
<p>In a unanimous vote that took place on February 15, 2006, the Maryland Higher Education Commission approved a revised mission statement submitted by the University of Baltimore, thus enabling the University to return to four-year undergraduate status.
This is the same initiative that already received approval from the Board of Regents in April of the prior year; however, the plan was revised slightly and now calls for freshmen to be admitted in the fall of 2007.</p>
<p>The University states that this new program will better reflect the current focus, and will be designed to prepare students in business, pre-law, technology, public affairs, and applied liberal arts.
The University says that it will be offering Freshman &quot;free&quot; tuition for their first year.
This was offered because of a donation made by an anonymous private donor.
In the fall of 2007, it is said that up to 140 Freshman will be entering.</p>
