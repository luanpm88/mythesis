<p>  <a>thumb|300 px|Buckman Hall</a> <strong>Rhodes College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, predominantly <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Memphis</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Originally founded by <a>freemason</a>s in 1848, Rhodes became affiliated with the <a>Presbyterian Church</a> in 1855.
Rhodes enrolls approximately 1,700 students pursuing bachelor's and master's degrees.
The college is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rhodes College traces its origin as a degree-granting institution to the <strong>Masonic University of Tennessee</strong>, founded in 1848 in <a>Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, by the Grand Masonic Lodge of Tennessee.
Since 1984, Rhodes has grown from a regionally recognized institution to a nationally ranked liberal arts college.
As enrollment has increased over the past twenty years, so has the proportion of students from outside Tennessee and the Southeast region.</p>
<p><a>Dr.
James Daughdrill</a> served as president for over a quarter century.
His successor is the current president of Rhodes, Dr. <a>William E. Troutt</a>, who joined the college as its 19th president in 1999.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The academic environment at Rhodes centers around small classes and an emphasis on student research and writing.
Students are encouraged to participate in off-campus activities and &quot;service learning.&quot;
They are also given the opportunity to participate in a variety of research-based programs, such as the Summer Plus program at <a>St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>, the Rhodes Institute for Regional Studies, the Center for Outreach and Development of the Arts, the Mike Curb Institute for Music, and the Rhodes Service Fellows program.</p>
<p>About one third of Rhodes students go on to <a>graduate</a> or <a>professional school</a> soon after <a>graduation</a>.
The acceptance rates of Rhodes <a>alumni</a> to <a>law</a> and <a>business school</a>s are around 95%, and the acceptance rate to <a>medical school</a>s is nearly twice the national average.</p>
<p>Rhodes was featured in <a>Loren Pope's</a> <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em> and on the cover of the 2008 <a>Princeton Review</a> <em><a>Complete Book of Colleges</a></em>.
<em>U.S. News and World Report</em> consistently ranks Rhodes among the nation's &quot;top-tier&quot; liberal arts colleges, ranking the school 47th among liberal arts colleges in 2010.
<a>Forbes</a> rated Rhodes 47th among all American colleges and universities in its 2010 publication of <a>America's Best Colleges</a></p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus covers a  tract in <a>midtown Memphis</a> across from <a>Overton Park</a> and the <a>Memphis Zoo</a>.
Often cited for its beauty, the campus design is notable for its stone <a>Gothic architecture</a> buildings, thirteen of which are currently listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>The original buildings, including Palmer Hall (1925), Kennedy Hall (1925), and Robb and White dormitories (1925), were designed by <a>Henry Hibbs</a> in consultation with <a>Charles Klauder</a>, who designed many buildings at <a>Princeton University</a>, alma mater of college president Charles Diehl.</p>
<p>Later buildings were designed by <a>H.
Clinton Parrent</a>, a young associate of Hibbs who was present from the beginning.
Parrent's buildings include the Catherine Burrow Refectory (1957), which was an expansion of Hibbs' original dining hall.
Parrent also added Halliburton Tower (1962) to Palmer Hall.
The  bell tower was named in honor of <a>explorer</a> <a>Richard Halliburton</a>.
The Paul Barret, Jr. Library holds a collection of Halliburton's papers.</p>
<p>Rhodes maintains its Collegiate Gothic architecture.
The latest example is the new Barret Library (2005), designed by the firm of Hanbury Evans Wright and Vlattas.</p>
<p>The campus was used as the setting of the movie <a>Making the Grade</a>.</p>
<h2>Students and faculty</h2>
<p>Rhodes enrolls 1675 undergraduate students from 48 <a>states</a>, the <a>District of Columbia</a>, and 11 foreign countries.
About 75% are <a>Caucasian</a>, 7% are <a>African American</a>, 5% are <a>Asia</a>n, 2% are <a>Hispanic</a>, 4% are international, and the <a>ethnicity</a> of about 6% is unknown.
Fifty-seven percent of students are female.
The student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1.
Some of the nearly 30 majors include <a>Economics</a> and <a>Business Administration</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>Political Science</a>, <a>English</a>, and <a>International Studies</a>.</p>
<h2>Traditions and clubs</h2>
<p>Rhodes is one of 62 colleges recently classified for both &quot;Curricular Engagement&quot; and &quot;Outreach &amp; Partnerships&quot; in the &quot;Community Engagement&quot; category by <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>.
Approximately 80% of Rhodes students participate in some form of <a>community service</a> by the time they graduate.
The curriculum includes a requirement that students participate in activities that broaden the connection between classroom experiences and the outside world.
The <a>mission statement</a> of the college also reinforces community engagement, aspiring to &quot;graduate students with...a compassion for others and the ability to translate academic study and personal concern into effective leadership and action in their communities and the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the life of the college is its Honor Code, administered by students through the Honor Council.
Every student is required to sign the Code, which reads, <em>&quot;As a member of the Rhodes College community, I pledge my full and steadfast support to the Honor System and agree neither to lie, cheat, nor steal and to report any such violation that I may witness.&quot;</em>
Because of this, students enjoy a relationship of trust with their professors and benefits such as taking closed book final exams in the privacy of their own rooms.
</p>
<p><em>Rites of Spring</em> is a three day music festival in early April.
A major social event of the school year, it typically attracts several major bands from around the country.
<em>Rites to Play</em> has in recent years brought elementary-school-age children to the campus.
Rhodes students plan, organize, and execute a <a>carnival</a> for the children, who are sponsored by community agencies and schools that partner with Rhodes.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The college mascot is the <a>lynx</a> and the school colors are red and black.</p>
<p>The athletic teams compete in the <a>Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference</a> in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division III</a>.
Rhodes counts five national championships to its credit - one awarded to the 1961 baseball team, and four awarded to its <a>mock trial</a> team.
</p>
<p>The <em>J.
Hal Daughdrill Award</em> is given to the &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; of the Lynx football team.
The award honors James Harold Daughdrill, Sr. (1903&#x2013;1986), outstanding football player, athlete, business leader, and the father of Rhodes' eighteenth President.
The <em>Rebecca Rish Gay Award</em> and <em>Walter E. Gay Award</em> are given to the &quot;Athletes of the Year&quot; and are named after the parents of former President Daughdrill&#x2019;s wife, Libby Daughdrill.</p>
