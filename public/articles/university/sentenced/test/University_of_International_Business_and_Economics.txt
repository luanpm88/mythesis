<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1951 and formerly called <strong><a>Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade</a></strong>&#xff0c;previously as an academic institute for training skilled personnel in fields related to foreign trade, finance etc.
It was first designated as a key university by the Chinese government as early as 1960  for its outstanding academic programs, and then redesignated as a national key university in 1978.
Following the onset of <a>Chinese economic reform</a> under Deng Xiaoping, UIBE witnessed unprecedented development and expansion, and in 1984 was renamed the current name, University of International Business and Economics.
In May 1997 UIBE was put on the list of &quot;<a>Project 211</a>&quot; universities of the first batch, a governmental program aimed at turning about 100 <a>Chinese universities</a> into exceptionally world renowned high-quality academic institutions in 21st century.
In the year of 2000, UIBE has become one of the <a>state universities</a> under the leadership of <a>the Ministry of Education</a>, and in June of the same year it merged with <strong><a>China Institute of Finance</a></strong>, from then on, it has become one of the leaders not only in the studies of <a>economics</a> and <a>business management</a>, but also in <a>finance</a>.
Since its establishment, UIBE was committed to make high emphasis on academic research and business practice&#xff0c;preparing students to work in the areas of business, economics, finance, foreign trade, foreign languages, etc.</p>
<h2>Faculty</h2>
<p>The University main areas of study are related to <a>business</a>, <a>economics</a>, <a>foreign language</a>s and <a>finance</a>, including <a>trade</a>, <a>management</a> or <a>commercial law</a>.
</p>
<p>The university has traditionally had a reputation as a training ground for top <a>civil servants</a> in the <a>Ministry of Commerce</a> (previously known as <em>Ministry of Foreign Trade</em>, <em>Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade</em> and <em>Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation</em>) under the <a>Chinese government</a>.
Until 1989, graduates went to work either for the Ministry or the many state-owned import/export companies throughout the country.
</p>
<p>UIBE is the home of <a>The Beijing Center</a>, a program for mainly <a>American</a> students studying in China who reside at UIBE and take <a>Chinese language</a> courses, as well as other courses taught in English, by a vast array of professors from <a>Beijing</a>'s top universities.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>The campus has been nicknamed &quot;Hui Garden&quot; (&#x60e0;&#x56ed;).
Seven buildings are either dormitories or classroom buildings.
There is a major academic building at the northwest of the site, which used to belong to the China Institute of Finance, named Boxue (&#x535a;&#x5b66;&#x697c;).
Another modern teaching building at the southeastern side,named Ningyuan (&#x5b81;&#x8fdc;&#x697c;).
There is also an imposing structure in the middle of the campus, named Chengxin (&#x8bda;&#x4fe1;&#x697c;).
A new library building was opened in October 2008.
</p>
<p>Apart from the sports areas, the rest of the campus is pleasantly landscaped, grassy lawns, Chinese garden (south side), bird cage, and a water pond dubbed (humorous) the &quot;Back Sea&quot; (see <a>Houhai</a>) by students.</p>
<p>Some members of the administration have nicknamed the university &quot;the <a>Switzerland</a> of Chinese universities&quot;, noting its compact size and high quality.
The University recently hired a foreign branding expert - Alexander Goldsborough -  as Director of International Marketing and Communications, to revisit the brand image of the University; re-doing the website was a top priority, UIBE now sports a new, and very attractive international website.
As a niche University in the Chinese landscape, UIBE works hard to be innovative and welcoming to international students.</p>
