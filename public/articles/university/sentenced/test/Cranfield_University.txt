<p></p>
<p><strong>Cranfield University</strong> is a <a>British</a> <a>postgraduate</a> <a>university</a> based on two <a>campus</a>es, with a research-oriented focus.
The main campus is at <a>Cranfield</a>, <a>Bedfordshire</a> and the second is the <a>Defence Academy of the United Kingdom</a> based at <a>Shrivenham</a>, <a>Oxfordshire</a>.
The main campus is unique in the United Kingdom for having its own operational airport (<a>Cranfield Airport</a>) next to the main campus.
The facilities at the airport are used by Cranfield University's own aircraft in the course of aerospace teaching and research.
The university also has connections in India and Australia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>250px|thumb|right|The new School, 'Cranfield Health' prior to official opening, May 2008, viewed from the Library</a> The University was formed in 1946 as the College of Aeronautics on the former <a>Royal Air Force</a> base of <a>RAF Cranfield</a> which opened in 1937.
(See also entries on <a>Harold Roxbee Cox</a>, Sir <a>Stafford Cripps</a> and <a>Roy Fedden</a>, all individuals associated with the foundation of the original College of Aeronautics).
Between 1955 and 1969 a period of diversification took place.
In 1967 the college presented the <a>Privy Council</a> with a <a>petition</a> for the grant of a <a>Royal Charter</a> along with a draft charter for a new institution to be called Cranfield Institute of Technology.
The Cranfield Institute of Technology was incorporated by <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1969, giving the institution its own <a>degree</a>-awarding powers.<a>250px|thumb|right|The
new School, 'Cranfield Health' interior</a>Since then the former <a>National College of Agricultural Engineering</a> established at <a>Silsoe</a> near <a>Luton</a>, <a>Bedfordshire</a>, in the 1960s, was incorporated.
This was relocated to the Cranfield campus and closed for teaching in 2007.
An academic partnership with the Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) at <a>Shrivenham</a> was formed in 1984.
RMCS, whose roots can be traced back to 1772, is now a part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom and now forms the Defence College of Management and Technology, known as 'DCMT' and from 2009 as &quot;Cranfield Defence and Security&quot;.
In 1993 a <a>Royal Charter</a> changed the institution's name to Cranfield University.</p>
<p>The first 50 year history of Cranfield University is described comprehensively, but concisely, by the book <em>Field of Vision</em>.</p>
<p>In 2003, the then RMCS site admitted its last undergraduates.
In 2006, it was decided that activities on the Silsoe site would be relocated to the main campus at Cranfield.
As a result, a substantial building program was undertaken on Cranfield campus, including the provision of departmental buildings and additional accommodation (<a>Stringfellow</a> and Chilver Halls), and Silsoe-based staff were transferred to Cranfield.</p>
