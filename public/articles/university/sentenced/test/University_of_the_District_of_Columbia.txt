<p>   The <strong>University of the District of Columbia</strong> (<strong>UDC</strong>) is a <a>historically black</a>, <a>public</a> university located in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> UDC is one of only a few urban <a>land-grant universities</a> in the country and a member of the <a>Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund</a>.
It is also the only Public University in the District of Columbia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Normal School for Colored Girls</a> was established in 1851 and by 1879, the name was changed to &quot;Miner Normal School&quot;.
Washington Normal School was established in 1873 for girls, and renamed the &quot;Wilson Normal School&quot; in 1913.
In 1929, the <a>United States Congress</a> made both schools four-year teachers' colleges and renamed as &quot;Miner Teachers College&quot; for <a>African Americans</a> and &quot;Wilson Teachers College&quot; for whites.
In 1955, the two schools merged and were renamed the &quot;District of Columbia Teachers College&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1967, Congress awarded the University of the District of Columbia  <a>land-grant status</a> and a $7.24 million endowment (USD), in lieu of a land grant.</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2009-10 academic year, UDC's programs were split into two separate institutions under an umbrella &quot;University System.&quot;
A new <a>Community College of the District of Columbia</a> (CCDC) assumed UDC's Associate Degree, Certificate, Continuing Education and Workforce Development programs with UDC going forward with just its  bachelor and graduate degree programs.
While CCDC will maintain an open enrollment policy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees admission into UDC.
These changes were in response to UDC's low graduation rate, where only 7.9% of students complete their degrees within 6 years.</p>
<p>The UDC's <a>adult education</a> department had a collegial relationship with the <a>University of Nairobi</a> for several years, including faculty exchange and doctoral student sponsoring.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The main (Van Ness) campus of UDC is located at <a>Connecticut Avenue</a> and Van Ness St. in <a>Northwest Washington, DC</a>.
UDC is primarily a commuter school and opened its first residential accommodations or <a>dormitories</a> in August 2010 by leasing an apartment building  across the street from its campus.
UDC plans to open a new residence hall on its main campus by 2012 that could house as many as 300 students.</p>
