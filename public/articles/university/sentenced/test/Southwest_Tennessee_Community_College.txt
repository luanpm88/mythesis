<p><strong>Southwest Tennessee Community College</strong> is a <a>community college</a> operated by the <em>Tennessee Board of Regents</em> in <a>Memphis, Tennessee</a>, <a>USA</a>.
It is the result of a 2001 <a>merger</a> between two institutions started by the Regents in the 1960s, the former <strong>Shelby State Community College</strong> and the former <strong>State Technical Institute at Memphis</strong> (&quot;STIM&quot;).
</p>
<p>The merger was an attempt to reduce the overhead of maintaining two separate institutional managements and a recognition of the increasing convergence of academic and technical <a>education</a>s.
It also has made credits earned at the former Technical Institute more readily transferable to other institutions of higher learning, an additional goal.
Southwest is the largest community college operated by the Tennessee Board of Regents, and also the only one with a predominantly <a>black</a> student body.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Women's Basketball</li>
