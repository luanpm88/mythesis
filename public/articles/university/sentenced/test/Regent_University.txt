<h2>University reputation</h2>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> ranks Regent University School of Law as a Tier 4 school,  the lowest ranking within the law school category.
The <a>Princeton Review</a> ranked Regent University seventh in the country for quality of life and the most conservative school.
The Sustainable Endowments Institute, an environmental report card, based in Cambridge, Mass., gave Regent a grade of D in its 2009 College Sustainability Report Card an improvement from the previous year's F grade.</p>
<h3>ABA national competition wins</h3>
<p>In 2006 and 2007, Regent Law won several national <a>ABA</a> <a>moot court</a> and negotiation competitions succeeding teams from Harvard and Yale.
Previous wins took place in 1995 and 2002.</p>
<h3>Bar passage rates</h3>
<p>The 2009 bar passage rate for students taking the Virginia State Bar Exam was 77.8 percent, compared to a statewide average of 76.4 percent.
The passage rate has improved every year from at least 2001, when the Regent University pass rate was 43.9 percent, compared to the state average of 73 percent.</p>
<h3>Identification with the Christian right</h3>
<p>In 1995, <a>Harvey Cox</a>, the liberal Harvard theologian, wrote that Regent has been called &quot;the Harvard of the <a>Christian Right</a>&quot; and noted that &quot;Regent, it appears, is not so much a boot camp for rightist cadres as a microcosm of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is often mistakenly seen as a monolithic 'religious right' in America&quot;.</p>
<p>While expressing concerns about Robertson's alleged past expressions of <a>antisemitism</a> (faculty blamed this on poorly chosen <a>ghost writers</a>) and associations with <a>dominion theology</a> promoting Christian control of secular institutions that some critics believe inspired the school's name, Cox said the faculty insisted that Regent didn't support <a>Dominionism</a>, pointing to the firing of <a>Herbert Titus</a>, the founding dean of the Law School, who was inclined to such a philosophy.
Cox pointed to historian Bruce Barron's suggestion that the Regent faculty serve as a &quot;moderating influence&quot;: &quot;They are pragmatists who accept religious pluralism and do not insist on the universal applicability of Old Testament law&quot; while preferring to focus on <a>constitutional</a> issues.
Cox characterized Regent's mission as continuing in the tradition of religiously trained professionals by various Catholic and Protestant faiths such as <a>Jesuit universities</a> and (originally) Harvard.
He found that <a>academic freedom</a> was promoted and that although half of the student body were either <a>Pentecostals</a> or <a>charismatics</a>, there existed a wider range of political attitudes than he first imagined.</p>
<h3>Counseling program controversy</h3>
<p>In June 2007,  five of the eleven full-time faculty members of the School of Psychology &amp; Counseling's master's counseling program resigned.
According to <em><a>The Virginia-Pilot</a></em>,  some students and former professors expressed frustration with what they described as humiliation and punishment for dissenting on policy questions resulting in decreased morale.</p>
<p>One professor said that there is a &quot;climate of fear and intimidation&#x201d; within the school.
Another said, &#x201c;The climate is contrary to Christian values rather than embracing them.&#x201d;
While a third said, &#x201c;I cannot in good conscience continue to participate in this unhealthy and toxic environment.&#x201d;
A petition was circulated which criticized the behavior of the school's dean and the counseling department's program director said to have used the terms &quot;brothas&#x201d;, &#x201c;hoes&#x201d; and &#x201c;homos&#x201d;, though some students said the words were used in an &quot;academic context&quot;.</p>
<p>Shortly after this article was printed, Robertson announced that he was considering purchasing the daily newspaper but later decided against it.</p>
<h3>Freedom of expression controversy</h3>
<p>In September 2007, Adam Key, a second-year law student at Regent University, posted a photograph on the social networking website <a>Facebook</a> of the school's chancellor, <a>Pat Robertson</a>, unintentionally making an <a>obscene gesture</a>.
Additionally, Key criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of <a>Venezuela</a>n President <a>Hugo Chavez</a>.
School officials asked Key to remove the still, publicly apologize and withhold public comment or, alternatively, defend the posting.
While Key did remove the photograph, he refused to apologize and submitted his defense on the grounds it was <a>protected speech</a>.
Regent rejected his argument and Key was subsequently suspended and later removed.
However, Key's attorney countered with examples of <a>racist</a> images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action, implying that they were acceptable forms of speech.</p>
<p>Later the school contended its actions were unrelated to the photograph and that he was a &quot;security risk&quot;; Key's attorney countered with an internal memo sent the day before the suspension indicating that Robertson was concerned with Key's &quot;complaints&quot;. </p>
<p>In June 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed.
The judge ruled that despite federal funding, Regent's decisions were not <a>state actions</a> and hence not governed by the <a>First Amendment</a>.
He also found that Robertson had not defamed Keys and that &quot;generic recruiting correspondence&quot; from the school could not be considered a contract and thereby dismissed the fraud complaint.</p>
<p>In November 2007, a civil rights lawyer representing Key sent a complaint to the <a>American Bar Association</a> calling for them to revoke the school's <a>accreditation</a>. Key claims  the university suspended him for his political and religious views in violation of ABA accreditation standards.</p>
<h3>Bush administration hires</h3>
<p>According to Regent University, more than 150 of its graduates had been hired by the federal government during the <a>George W. Bush</a> presidency As it was previously rare for alumni to go into government, <em><a>Boston Globe</a></em> journalist <a>Charlie Savage</a> suggested that the appointment of <a>Office of Personnel Management</a> director <a>Kay Coles James</a>, the former dean of Regent's government school, caused this sharp increase in Regent alumni employed in the government.
<em><a>The Washington Post</a></em> contrasted the employment of Regent employees by Bush to the hiring practices of his successor <a>Barack Obama</a> who tended to select from higher tiered colleges.
Though a  prominent critic of the school, <a>Reverend Barry Lynn</a> of <a>Americans United for the Separation of Church and State</a> advised against &quot;underestimat[ing] the quality of a lot of the people that are there.&quot;
Also named Distinguished Professor was former <a>Chief of Naval Operations</a> <a>Admiral Vern Clark</a> who teaches courses in leadership and government.
In 2006, former <a>Israel</a>i <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Ehud Barak</a> was a visiting faculty member for the School of Undergraduate Studies.
<a>Herb Titus</a>, founding dean of the Law School, was the 1996 vice-presidential candidate of the <a>Constitution Party</a> and a drafter of the <a>Constitutional Restoration Act</a> to permit government officials to acknowledge &quot;God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government&quot;.
Titus was fired in 1993 for being &quot;too extreme&quot;.
notably the <a>theologian</a> <a>Graham Twelftree</a>, Dean Emeritus <a>H.
Vinson Synan</a>, <a>Pentecostal</a> theologian Amos Yong and church historian Stanley M. Burgess.
The late <a>J.
Rodman Williams</a> was Professor Emeritus.</p>
