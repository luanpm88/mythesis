<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the <a>American Civil War</a>, <a>William Mahone</a> (1826&#x2013;1895) of <a>Petersburg, Virginia</a> was the driving force in the linkage of <a>Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad</a>, <a>South Side Railroad</a> and the <a>Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad</a> in 1870 to form the <a>Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad</a> (AM&amp;O), a new line extending from <a>Norfolk</a> to <a>Bristol</a>.
After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone's role as a railroad builder ended in 1881 when the AM&amp;O was sold at auction to form the <a>Norfolk and Western Railway</a>.</p>
<p>Mahone, a former Confederate general best known as the hero of the <a>Battle of the Crater</a>, later led Virginia's <a>Readjuster Party</a> and was a major proponent of public schools for the education of the former <a>slave</a>s and free blacks.
He became a <a>United States Senator</a> from Virginia, and arranged for the proceeds of the AM&amp;O sale to help found a school for teachers near <a>Petersburg</a>.
In 1882, the <em>Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute</em> at Petersburg was established.
State delegate <a>Alfred W. Harris</a>, a black attorney, introduced the bill that established the institute.</p>
<p>The school was designated one of Virginia's <a>land grant colleges</a> in response to the 1890 Amendments to the <a>Morrill Act</a>, which required that states either open their land-grant colleges to all races or else establish a separate land-grant educational facilities for blacks.</p>
<p>Virginia State's first president was <a>John Mercer Langston</a>, who later became the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia.
The board of trustees was almost entirely African-American, except for one member.
The faculty of the collegiate program and the normal school was African-American until the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>In 1902, the legislature revised the school's charter and renamed it the <em>Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute</em>.
In 1923, the college was renamed <em>Virginia State College for Negroes</em>, shortened to <em>Virginia State College</em> in 1946, and finally renamed Virginia State University in 1979.
Meanwhile, the school's two-year branch in <a>Norfolk</a>, <a>Virginia</a>, founded in 1935, became Norfolk State College, now known as <a>Norfolk State University</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, the university accepted its first students in its first Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2010, Dr. Keith T. Miller became the university's 13th president.</p>
