<h2>History and development</h2>
<p>The university descends from two <a>Anglican</a> teacher training colleges, which were founded in York in 1841 (for men) and 1846 (for women).
In 1862, the women's college relocated to <a>Ripon</a>.
Over the next century, the colleges gradually diversified their education programmes.
The colleges merged in 1974 to form the <strong>College of Ripon and York St John</strong>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Quad West entrance</a> In 1990 the combined institution formally became a college of the <a>University of Leeds</a>; this arrangement allowed it to award degrees in the name of the latter, while remaining in practice largely autonomous.
Between 1999 and 2001, all activities were transferred to York and the college received the name  <strong>York St John College</strong>.</p>
<p>In February 2006, the College was granted the right to award degrees in its own name and the right to call itself a University College.
On 10 July 2006 the <a>Privy Council</a> approved a request from the college to become a fully-fledged University; the name became <strong>York St John University</strong> on 1 October 2006, and the first Chancellor (installed at a ceremony in York Minster on 7 March 2007) is the <a>Archbishop of York</a> <a>John Sentamu</a>.</p>

<h3>Reducing antisocial behaviour amongst students</h3>
<p>In 2010, the University's Student Union began a programme of action designed to combat the growing antisocial behaviour amongst its own students.
Private security staff paid by the Union were reported to be on patrol until 3am in areas where record numbers of complaints had arisen.
In 2002, a campaign entitled &quot;SSHH - Silent Students Happy Homes&quot; was initiated to combat local residents' fears of <a>studentification</a>.
This has subsequently been adopted by other students' unions around the UK, although in many instances the expansion of the abbreviation has been dropped, leaving campaigns called &quot;Shh&quot;, &quot;Sshh&quot;, or variants .
In 2005, the Students' Union launched another community-friendly campaign called 'Pick It Up'.
This campaign was designed to reduce litter levels on campus and in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>YSJSU is run by three Sabbatical Officers; President, Vice President of Education and Welfare and Vice President of Student Activities.</p>
<p>In October 2009 the Student Union was awarded a Bronze <a>Students' Union Evaluation Initiative</a> award, one of 16 institutions to receive this accolade.
Awards are made from bronze (lowest) to gold (highest).
The scheme is administered by a former manager of Sheffield University Student Union.
