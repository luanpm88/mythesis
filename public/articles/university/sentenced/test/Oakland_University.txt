The <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> has classified OU as a Doctoral Research-Intensive University.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oakland University was created in 1957 when <a>Matilda Dodge Wilson</a>, widow of automobile magnate <a>John Francis Dodge</a>, and her second husband, Alfred Wilson, donated their  estate to <a>Michigan State University</a>, including <a>Meadow Brook Hall</a>, Sunset Terrace and all the estate's other buildings and collections, along with $2 million.
Main campus buildings were completed near Squirrel Road in Pontiac Township (now the city of Auburn Hills).
Originally known as Michigan State University&#x2013;Oakland, the university enrolled its first students in 1959 and was renamed Oakland University in 1963.
The university has been officially independent since 1970.
Wilson asked <a>U.S. Postmaster General</a> <a>Arthur Summerfield</a> to let the university use a <a>Rochester, Michigan</a> mailing address, even though the main part of the campus was in <a>Pontiac Township</a> (now Auburn Hills).
After reminding Summerfield that she had contributed to his administration, Summerfield granted her request.
The city of Rochester is five miles (8 km) from the main campus buildings.</p>
<p>For the Fall 2009 semester, OU had an enrollment of 18,920 students.
The current president of the university is Dr. Gary Russi, who replaced Dr. Sandra Packard on an interim basis in 1995 and was appointed president by the Board of Trustees in 1996.</p>
<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>Oakland University's motto is <em><a>Seguir virtute e canoscenza</a></em> (&quot;Seek virtue and knowledge&quot;).
It is a quotation from <a>Dante</a>'s <em><a>Inferno</a></em>, Canto XXVI, 1. 120.
These are the final words of Ulysses' speech to his men urging them to sail on in pursuit of knowledge and experience of the world &mdash; even beyond the pillars of Hercules, traditionally the frontier and limit of legitimate exploration.</p>
<p>This is the three-line stanza:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Considerate la vostra semenza / Fatti non foste a viver come bruti / Ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Consider your birth [or &quot;origin&quot;] / You were not made to live like brutes / But to follow courage and knowledge [or &quot;virtue and wisdom,&quot; or &quot;fortitude and learning&quot;].</p>
</blockquote>
