It was founded in 1904 by the <a>Society of Saint Edmund</a>, a French order of Catholic priests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Aerial view of the campus.</a></p>
<p>In 1889, priests from the <a>Society of Saint Edmund</a> fled to the United States after <a>widespread anticlericism seized France</a>.
In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.
Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105.
Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program.
Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy with old military barracks as dormitories to a traditional residential college.
In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.
</p>
<p>Saint Michael&#x2019;s Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont and giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Before the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class.
In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class.
The College began a building program which established the architectural style which permeates the College today.</p>
<p>Saint Michael's Applied Linguistics Department was started in 1954, focusing on teaching <a>English</a> to students from around the world.</p>
<p>The <a>Hungarian uprising</a> of 1956, brought about 130 refugees, most already well-educated, to the college to learn English.</p>
<p>In 2003, <a>Harold Bloom</a>, a leading literary scholar at <a>Yale</a>, announced his plans to donate his personal library to the College, and an anonymous donor granted the money to build the Dupont Library to house the collection.
In 2004, Saint Michael's celebrated its centenary in an 18-month-long series of events including special lectures, musical performances, and convocations.
The college has been co-educational since 1970.</p>
<h3>Tradition.
Culture</h3>
<p>&lt;!--not sure about subtitle here but material is similar to sections in other colleges---&gt; In the 1950s, Freshmen were required to wear a dress shirt, coat and tie to every class and for the evening meal.

Saint Michael's houses the following honors: <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>; Delta Epsilon Sigma, the Catholic honor society; Pi Sigma Alpha for Political Science; <a>Omicron Delta Epsilon</a> for Economics; <a>Phi Alpha Theta</a> for History; Kappa Delta Pi for Education; <a>Psi Chi</a> for Psychology; <a>Sigma Xi</a> for Science and Technology; <a>Pi Mu Epsilon</a> for Mathematics; Kappa Tau Alpha for Journalism and Mass Communication (the only KTA chapter nationwide housed at a small college); and Sigma Beta Delta for Business, Management and Administration.
