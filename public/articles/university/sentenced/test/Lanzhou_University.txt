<p> <a>thumb|Lanzhou University</a> <strong>Lanzhou University</strong>, founded in 1909, () is a <a>university</a> located in <a>Lanzhou</a>, <a>Gansu</a> Province, <a>China</a>.
It provides programs for undergraduate, graduate students on four <a>campus</a>es--three in <a>Lanzhou</a> city centre and one in <a>Yuzhong</a> (&#x6986;&#x4e2d;), which is about 30 miles away from the main campus.
Total enrollment is approximately 20,000.
Undergraduate students study at the Yuzhong campus.</p>
<p>Lanzhou University had formerly been one of <a>China</a>'s premier <a>institutions of higher learning</a>.
It still maintains its position as the best university in Northwestern China.</p>
<p>Lanzhou University maintains one of China's top ten <a>Ph.D.</a> programs in <a>physics</a>, <a>chemistry</a>, and <a>geography</a> and highly-ranked programs in <a>biology</a>, <a>botany</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>media</a>, <a>ecology</a> and <a>Chinese literature</a>.</p>
<p>Lanzhou University's main campus is a ten minute walk from Lanzhou Train Station.
Parts of the campus are considered aesthetically pleasing, particularly in comparison to the rest of highly-industrialized Lanzhou, with a small park and man-made pond.
Although the old dormitory buildings were in disrepair, the campus is undergoing an overhaul of its image.
New dormitories are being built, with some finished already.</p>
<p>Lanzhou University employs instructors from outside China in foreign languages (e.g.
<a>English</a>, <a>Russian</a> and <a>Japanese</a>) and in physics, as well as frequently inviting guest lecturers from a variety of fields.
It also has a popular Friday gathering within the gardens of the university to allow students to practice their English language skills.
Non-university students are generally allowed to attend such gatherings.</p>

<h2>Primary Laboratories</h2>
<p>Lanzhou University has three primary laboratories and analytical testing facility sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Education and deemed as high importance to the state.</p>
<h3>Laboratory of Arid Agroecology</h3>
<p>The laboratory was founded in 1991 under ratification of the Planning Commission of China and engaged in arid agriculture ecology research.
The Laboratory of Arid Agroecology is the only lab engaged in arid agriculture ecology research under the Chinese Ministry of Education.
The lab has been highly developed on the basis of the authorization to confer bachelor, masters, doctorate and post-doctoral degrees through the financial aid of the World Bank loan.</p>
<h3>Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry</h3>
<p>The Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry was one of the first state key laboratories ratified by Planning Commission of China.
It was founded in December 1987, open to visiting scholars and scientists from both within China and abroad.
It is one primary laboratories to cultivate talents for organic chemistry.
The researches of the laboratory focus on organic molecular chemistry of special function, especially in the field of basic research on active organic molecules.</p>
<h3>Open Laboratory of Applied Magnetism</h3>
<p>Created in 1993 by the Chinese Ministry of Education, this is an open laboratory conducting research in the field of Applied Magnetism.
The lab is chiefly engaged in studies on applications of perpendicular magnetic recording.
The laboratory also conducts research and development on new applied magnetic materials which can be used for commercial applications.
Mossbauer spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resource spin echo spectroscopy and general magnetic testing media are used to study magnetic materials&#x2019; microscopic structure and general magnetic behavior.
The laboratory is equipped with major facilities including a vibrating sample magnetometer, high pressure mossbauer spectroscope and magnetron sputtering system, along with many others.
The lab also serves as a key resource for research in materials science and condensed matter physics.</p>
<p>The laboratory has 24 professional researchers and technicians, among who are 4 doctoral advisers.</p>
<h3>Analytical Testing Center</h3>
<p>Financed by the first loan issued by the World Bank to develop universities, construction on this center began in 1982.
It contains more than 20 major instruments and devices including a High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer, Infrared Spectrometer, X-Ray Quadrupole Diffractometer, Laser Raman Spectrometer, FT-IR Spectrometer, and others.
The center is primarily engaged in the determination and analysis of the structure of matter.
It also conducts graduate students&#x2019; experiments which leads to the conferring of Master&#x2019;s and Ph.D. degrees.
A testing service is available to the public.</p>
<p>Established by the State Technology Superintendency in 1992, it is the approved lab for the inspection of imported and exported chemical and mining products.</p>
