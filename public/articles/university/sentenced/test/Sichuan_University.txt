<h2>History</h2>
<p> Sichuan University (SCU)  is the result of a merge of three national universities.
In 1994, the original Sichuan University merged with the Chengdu University of Science and Technology (CUST), a national university under <a>the Ministry of Education</a>.
The merged university was shortly known by the name of Sichuan Union University.
In 2000, Sichuan University merged with West China University of Medical Science (WCUMS), a university under the State <a>Ministry of Health</a>, and became &quot;Sichuan University&quot;.
</p>
<p>The original Sichuan University was one of the earliest institutions of <a>higher education in China</a>, with a history dating back to <em>Sichuan Zhong-Xi Xuetang</em> (Sichuan Chinese and Western School), established in 1896.
The Xuetang was in a direct line of succession with <em>Jinjiang Shuyuan</em> and <em>Zunjing Shuyuan</em>, institutions of <a>Chinese classic</a>al learning, established in 1704 and 1875, respectively.
By 1949, Sichuan University had developed into the biggest national multidisciplinary university with branches in: <a>literature</a>, <a>science</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, <a>law</a>, and <a>teacher training</a>.
</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|400px|The Old Gate at SCU</a> In 1949, upon the nationwide adjustment of universities and colleges, spurred by the <a>Chinese revolution</a>, Sichuan University added courses on literature, <a>historiography</a>, <a>religion</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>physics</a>, <a>biology</a>, and other subjects.
In 1958, it was the only university outside <a>Beijing</a> directly administerd by the <a>Central Government</a>.</p>
<p>The former Chengdu University of Science and Technology was established as the Chengdu Engineering College in 1954 as the result of the nation-wide college and department adjustment.
It specialized in  <a>chemical engineering</a>, <a>hydroelectricity</a>, <a>mechanics</a>, <a>textiles</a>, and <a>light industry</a>.
</p>
<p>The former West China University of Medical Science was originally built as a private medical school, once known as Huaxi Xiehe College (West China Union College).
It was established in 1910 by five Christian missionary groups from the <a>U.S.</a>, <a>UK</a> and <a>Canada</a>, with offered courses in stomatology, biomedicine, basic medicine and clinical medicine.
WCUMS has been a  medical university in China that also enjoys a good reputation abroad.

<ul>
  <li><a>College of Physical Science and Technology</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The College of Physical Science and Technology is located in Wangjiang Campus, which is one of the most biggest and eldest college in the university.
The Department of Physics was established in the year 1928, which means have a history more than 80 years.
There are two key national deciplines, which is Atomic&amp;Mol.
Physics and Nuclear Technology.
Basically speaking, the Atomic&amp;Mol.
Physics is studied in the western part of Wangjiang Campus, and the Nuclear Technology is carried out in the eastern part, in NO.1 Science Building.
There're also professor focus on the study of Optics, Condense Matter, Theory.
The Optics was originally a national discipline in 1980s, but not as much currently.
Condense Matter physics was famous for its research on mesoscopic electron transportation lab.
And the leader of the laboratory, academician of Chinese Engineering Academy Prof. Jie Gao, now focus on the transportation of single electron with the aim of finding novelty ways to measure tiny electrical current.
