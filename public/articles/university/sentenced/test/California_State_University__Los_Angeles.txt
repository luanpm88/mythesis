<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|225px|CSULA main walkway</a></p>
<p>The campus is nestled among rolling <a>hills</a> on a site that once housed one of <a>California</a>'s 36 original <a>adobes</a>, built in 1776 by <a>Franciscan</a> missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908.
These lands once were part of a Spanish land grant known as <a>Rancho Rosa Castilla</a>, given to Juan Batista Batz, a <a>Basque</a> rancher from northern <a>Spain</a> who settled here in the 1850s.
The inspiration for the name of the rancho, according to local historians, was the wild <a>rose</a>s that once grew near the ranch home.
The main drive through the campus is known as Paseo Rancho Castilla, in acknowledgment of the University's historic heritage.</p>
<p>CSULA was founded on July 2, 1947 by an act of the California <a>legislature</a> and opened for classes as &quot;The Los Angeles State College&quot; (LASC) on the campus of <a>Los Angeles City College</a> (LACC).
In 1949, the Los Angeles State College was reconstituted by the Legislature as &quot;The Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences.&quot;
In 1964, the <a>Board of Trustees</a> of the California State Colleges changed the name of the college to the &quot;California State College at Los Angeles,&quot; and in 1968 to &quot;California State College, Los Angeles&quot; (CSCLA), when it became part of the California State College (CSC) system.
In 1972, CSCLA was awarded University status and was renamed California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA).</p>
<p>From 1947 to 1955, the college shared the campus of the Los Angeles City College but the shared-campus experiment proved to be unwieldy and the college moved to its present campus of one hundred and seventy-five acres in the northeastern section of the City of Los Angeles, five miles (8&nbsp;km) east of the Civic Center.</p>
<p>In 1952 the state propos a new satellite campus for CSULA, at the time known as Los Angeles State College, and in July 1958, the campus separated from CSULA and was renamed San Fernando Valley State College (Now known as <a>California State University, Northridge</a>).</p>
<p>A Statue of <a>Confucius</a>, a gift of the <a>Republic of China</a> in <a>Taiwan</a>, was dedicated June 1987.
The statue was moved to a new campus location in summer 2005.
Its home is now on the grassy area, south of the State Playhouse.</p>
<p>CSU <a>Chancellor</a> and Trustees approve development of Cal State L.A.'s Charter School of Education, creating the first such school of higher education in the nation in 1993.</p>

<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p> From 1964 to 1972, developer <a>Louis Lesser</a> built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls to house 3,600 students.
The  campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959.
This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State L.A. the largest in the <a>California State University</a> system.
<a>Maxwell Starkman</a> &amp; Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan.
Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by <a>Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc.</a>
The first on-campus housing was opened on June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex was opened.
CSULA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009).
During <a>1984 Summer Olympics</a> that took place in <a>Los Angeles</a> CSULA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics.
Lesser also pioneered &#x201c;<a>underground parking</a>&#x201d;, with his Cal State L.A. development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper section header, &#x201c;Parking Underground&#x201d;, which described a two-level underground parking lot as  a &#x201c;concept&#x201d; of &#x201c;subterranean spaces&#x201d;.</p>
<h3>Parking and Public Transportation</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The Golden Eagle</a></p>
<p>Cal State L.A.'s parking received press coverage for pioneering the concept of underground parking; to deal with the limitations of ground space for expansion under the initial California State expansion plans of the early 1960s.
Developer <a>Louis Lesser</a> developed &quot;<a>underground parking</a>&#x201d; in his off campus residential housing development for the university in 1964, with only a two level underground parking structure considered so unusual as to merit a separate newspaper section header, &#x201c;Parking Underground&#x201d;,  and calling the parking &#x201c;subterranean spaces.&quot;
</p>
<p>Cal State L.A. now has ample parking spaces for its students and staff.
Student permits for parking at Cal State L.A. cost about $90 (as of Spring 2010) for a one quarter parking permit.</p>
<p>Cal State L.A. is uniquely commuter friendly.
There are several large parking structures, and surface lots for automobiles.
In addition, the school is home to the first commuter <a>rail</a> station on a college campus, the <a>CSULA station</a> on <a>Metrolink's</a> <a>San Bernardino Line</a>, which opened in October 1994.
Southern California&#x2019;s only campus Metrolink station, second only to <a>Union Station</a> as L.A.&#x2019;s busiest.

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<h3>University Seal</h3>
<p>The University Seal has as its motif the outline of the State of California, with a <a>sunburst</a> indicating the location of the University within the city of Los Angeles.
The open book symbolizes the educational purpose of the University, with the numerals indicating the date of founding.
The original design for the seal, created by John R. Siebon, was accepted by the Associated Students as their official emblem in November 1949, and was adopted officially by the President of the University and the <a>Executive Council</a> in April 1953.</p>
<h3>University Mace</h3>
<p>The University <a>Mace</a> is a ceremonial piece symbolizing the authority under which the University is chartered.
It is identified with the Office of the President and is carried in academic processions for <a>commencements</a> and other official University gatherings.
The honor of serving as <a>mace-bearer</a> is accorded to the <a>Chair</a> of the <a>Academic Senate</a>.</p>
<p>The University Mace, first used at the annual commencement exercises in June 1960, was designed and executed by Hudson Roysher, <a>Emeritus</a> Professor of Art.
The head of the mace bears the seal of the University.
The crowning ornament on the head depicts three <a>buds</a> of the <a>bird of paradise</a>, official flower of the City of Los Angeles.
The buds represent the arts, letters, and sciences.
The design at the foot of the mace is derived from the <a>poppy</a>, floral emblem of the State of California.
The decorative bands encircling the mace symbolize the mountainous terrain of Southern California.</p>
<h3>A-frame sculpture</h3>
<p>Since 1982, a wooden <a>A-frame</a> <a>sculpture</a> in title &#x201c;Time Line for Forgotten Ancestors&#x201d; has been displayed on the lawn west of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library&#x2019;s Palmer Wing, across from the bookstore.
It was donated to the <a>CSULA Art Department</a> by artist Michael Davis.
The sculpture was supposed to face the sun, so it can create a very specific <a>shadow</a> but the university installed it wrong destroying its main purpose.</p>
<h2>Future developments</h2>
<p>The University has several construction projects slated for the next five years.
Classes are underway in La Kretz Hall; the first wing of the <a>Wallis Annenberg</a> Integrated Sciences Complex, constructed on the site of the university's former tennis and basketball courts.
Construction has begun on the second wing of the Complex, which will add another 94,000 gross-square-feet of lab space, instructional space and the Dean&#x2019;s Suite.</p>
<p>A two-story single building, 30,000 gross-square-feet Corporate Yard to house Shipping and Receiving, Materials Management, Campus Stores, Facilities Planning and Construction, Environmental Health and Safety, and Facilities Services is planned to replace existing aging facilities at the south entrance of the campus.
A space assignment plan and schedule is being prepared to handle interim operations during construction.</p>
<p>The fence surrounding the north-end parking lot close to the Welcome Center contains the footprint for a 16,000 gross-square-foot, single-story Public Safety building.
This improved location will enable Public Safety and Parking Services to better serve the campus' and visitors&#x2019; needs.
The current home of Public Safety is one of the &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; bungalows constructed 50 years ago.</p>
<p><a>Los Angeles County High School for the Arts</a> (LACHSA) design for its future home &#x2014; a , three-story building - is being reviewed for final approval.
This facility on the north side of campus will serve the 600 LACHSA students as well as benefit CSULA, as a shared-use facility.</p>
<p>Fundraising is underway to match the award of $2.2 million from the <a>California Air Resources Board</a> (CARB) to support the construction of a <a>Hydrogen</a> <a>Fueling Station</a> on campus.
The station will operate as a teaching resource for classes on <a>alternative energy</a> and <a>fuel system</a>s, as well as a public accommodation selling and dispensing hydrogen to those driving <a>fuel cell</a> vehicles.
CSULA is one of only three organizations in the state to be awarded CARB funding for such a facility.</p>
