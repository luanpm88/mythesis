<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of (Feyziye Schools Foundation I&#x015f;&#x0131;k Schools) <a>Feyziye Mektepleri Vakfi Isik Okullar&#x0131;</a> began on 14 December 1885 in the city of Thessaloniki, one of the most dynamic cities in the days of the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, with the establishment of Feyz-i S&#x0131;byan School.</p>
<p>The school has gone through enormous expansion, including &#x015e;emsi Efendi School - the school where <a>Mustafa Kemal Atat&#x00fc;rk</a> received his initial education.
Following the <a>Balkan Wars</a> when Thessaloniki became part of <a>Greece</a>, Feyziye School moved its operations to Istanbul and continued its pursuit in educational excellence in <a>Ni&#x015f;anta&#x015f;&#x0131; Naciye Sultan Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>In 1935 during the 50th anniversary of the School, the name was changed from &quot;Feyziye&quot; to &quot;I&#x015f;&#x0131;k&quot; (which means &quot;light&quot; in Turkish) with the blessings of Mustafa Kemal Atat&#x00fc;rk.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Foundation completed its <a>Maslak</a> <a>campus</a>, in order to meet the need for educational <a>institution</a>s.
Finally, in the beginning of the 1996-1997 <a>academic year</a>, I&#x015f;&#x0131;k University was launched in the Maslak Campus, starting a new page in the history of the Foundation.</p>
<p>Feyziye Schools Foundation has served the <a>Turkish Educational System</a> for 124 years, from <a>preschool</a> to <a>graduate level education</a>.</p>
