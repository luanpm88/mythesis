<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded on May 7, 1851, as the <em><a>Cherokee</a> National Female Seminary</em>.
On March 6, 1909, the State Legislature of Oklahoma passed an act providing for the creation and location of Northeastern State Normal School at <a>Tahlequah, Oklahoma</a>, and for the purchase from  the Cherokee Tribal Government of the building, land, and equipment of the Cherokee Female Seminary.
In the 1950s Northeastern emerged as a comprehensive state college, broadening its curriculum at the baccalaureate level to encompass liberal arts subjects and adding a fifth year program designed to prepare master teachers for elementary and secondary schools.
In 1974, the <a>Oklahoma</a> Legislature authorized that the name of the institution be changed from Northeastern State Normal School to Northeastern Oklahoma State University and then again in 1985 to Northeastern State University.
Northeastern is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of Oklahoma as well as one of the oldest institutions of higher learning west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.
Today NSU is the fourth largest university in Oklahoma.
