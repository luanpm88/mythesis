<h2>Praxis</h2>
<p>To Minho University we can associate the praxe of the <em>Academia Minhota</em>.
Praxe in Campus of Azur&#x00e9;m and Campus of Gualtar is radically different from the praxis of other universities.
The majority of these have the same hierarchy and terminology, mostly based on army terms, such as the Latin word of general, <em>dux</em>; however, <em>Academia Minhota</em> based its praxe tradition on clerical hierarchy, substituting &quot;dux veteranorum', ther term designating the head of praxe, for <em>pope</em>.</p>
