<p> <strong>Coker College</strong> readies undergraduates for personal and professional success through a distinctive four-year program that emphasizes a practical application of the liberal arts as well as hands-on and discussion-based learning within and beyond the classroom.
Coker is ranked among the &quot;Best Colleges&quot; in the South by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> as well as <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>.
Located in <a>Hartsville, Darlington County, South Carolina</a>, Coker is within two hours of the cultural, financial and recreational resources of <a>Charlotte</a>, <a>Columbia</a>, <a>Charleston</a> and <a>Myrtle Beach</a>.
</p>
<p>Founded in 1908, Coker is a private, co-ed four-year <a>liberal arts college</a>.
It is fully accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
Coker's sports teams, nicknamed the Cobras, compete in <a>NCAA Division II</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>As a Liberal Arts institution, Coker declares that its mission is to be a student-centered, comprehensive, degree-granting college.
Coker's goal is to graduate students with the ability to think analytically and creatively, and to write and speak effectively.
It strives to provide every student with an academic curriculum based upon a liberal arts core, known as the Liberal Arts Studies Program (LASP).
</p>
<p>The LASP is divided into different baskets of knowledge, and the student chooses the available classes from each basket that most interest them.
The baskets are Core Skills (21 semester hours), Knowledge of the Arts (6 hours), Knowledge of the Behavioral Sciences (6 hours), Knowledge of the Humanities (6 hours), Knowledge of the Natural Sciences (7 hours), Knowledge of the United States (3 hours) and Knowledge of the Wider World (3 hours).
As the students progresses through school, they may select classes to fulfill basket requirements that are in tune with their interests.
For example, in the Knowledge of the Wider World baskets, students could choose a class on <a>Latin-American Literature</a>, World Religions, International Politics, Musics of the World, Modernization and Social Change or African Geography, among others.
The classes offered under each basket allow for a host of different options, with no two students ever really taking all the same classes.</p>

Students live and study on campus and go on field trips to Charleston, Charlotte and other destinations.</p>
<h3>CRLCD</h3>
<p>In May 2003, Coker established the Center for Research in Leadership and Community Development (CRLCD), a clearinghouse of information and a laboratory for community development and leadership programs.
</p>
<p>The Center creates, implements and evaluates models for partnerships between higher education, community organizations, local, state and national government entities and funding agencies.
It also assists communities with established development programs.</p>
<h3>Study Abroad</h3>

<h2>Redefining Ready</h2>
<p>Since the inauguration of <a>Dr.
Robert L. Wyatt</a> as Coker College's 16th president on July 1, 2009, the college has been putting forth efforts to &quot;[Re]define Ready.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Preparing our students for the world as it was, or even as it is, does them a serious disservice,&quot; said Dr. Wyatt during his inauguration speech.
&quot;We have to help them to succeed regardless of what the future brings.
We have to Redefine Ready.
Instead of our graduates wondering, 'Am I ready for the real world?' we want them asking, 'Is the real world ready for me?&quot;</p>
<p><a><strong>The [Re]defining Ready Top Ten List:</strong></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>10.
We must redefine what it means to say, &quot;A Coker student is ready.&quot;</li>
<li>9.
We must redefine what we mean when we say, &quot;A Coker student leads by example.&quot;</li>
<li>8.
We must redefine, &quot;A Coker student drives change.&quot;</li>
<li>7.
We must redefine, &quot;A Coker student solves big problems.&quot;</li>
<li>6.
We must redefine what we mean when we say, &quot;A Coker student lives long, happily and well.&quot;</li>
<li>5.
We must redefine what it means to be student-focused.</li>
<li>4.
We must redefine our intention when we affirm, &quot;A Coker student has multiple educational options.&quot;</li>
<li>3.
We must redefine our claim, &quot;A Coker student learns by doing.&quot;</li>
<li>2.
We must redefine our assertion, &quot;A Coker student makes all the difference.&quot;</li>
<li>1.
Finally, we must redefine and make good our promise when we say, &quot;A Coker student is ready for the world.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Coker College began in 1894 as Welsh Neck High School, founded by a local businessman and <a>American Civil War</a> veteran, <a>Major James Lide Coker</a> (1837&#x2013;1918).
In 1908, when <a>South Carolina</a> created a statewide public school system, Major Coker led the effort to convert the school to Coker College for Women.
</p>
<p>From the 1920s until just after <a>World War II</a>, it was the only college between <a>Columbia</a> and <a>Charleston</a> accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
</p>
<p>Coker was once affiliated with the <a>South Carolina Baptist Convention</a>, but has been non-denominational since 1944.
It officially became co-ed in 1969, although men had been attending since the end of <a>World War II</a>.</p>
<p>From 1988 to 2003, Coker students often interacted with students from <a>South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics</a> (SCGSSM) who lived and took their own courses on campus.
In 2003, the SCGSSM moved to its own campus a few blocks away.</p>
<h2>Financial Aid</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of Coker students receive need-based financial aid in addition to academic, athletic and other talent-based scholarships.</p>
<p>The <a>Financial Aid Office</a> is dedicated to helping each family navigate the financial planning process.</p>
<p>Coker awards more than $5.7 million annually in scholarships and grants in addition to federal and state aid.</p>
<p>The <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> has given Coker special commendations for the quality of interaction between faculty, students and staff and the attractiveness of the campus grounds and facilities.</p>
<p><em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> selected Coker College a &#x201c;Best Southeastern College&#x201d; in its 2011 rankings based on academic excellence and student satisfaction; this is Coker's seventh consecutive selection to this honor.
</p>
<p>Barron&#x2019;s consistently names Coker one of the nation's 300 Best Buys in College Education.</p>
<p>The <a>National Survey of Student Engagement</a> ranked Coker in the top 10% of all institutions for providing students with a supportive campus environment, enriching educational experiences, student-faculty interaction, active and collaborative learning and a high level of academic challenge.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The  main campus contains mostly Georgian-style brick buildings, some of which (e.g., Davidson Hall, home to the college's famed round table classrooms) are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
The Alumni House (Drengaelen), The President's House, The Dean's &amp; President's Offices (David &amp; May Coker House) and The Registrar's Offices (Lawton-Wilson House) are all located in old mansions along the northern edge of campus.</p>
<p>Hartsville and Coker College owe much to the generosity of the Coker family, founders of <a>Sonoco</a> and Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company.
The Coker family's patronage of the college has led the vast majority of buildings on campus having Coker somewhere in the name.
Students often joke to freshmen or visitors that they'll meet them &quot;in the Coker&quot; building as a way to gently initiate newcomers to campus.</p>
<h3>Residence Halls</h3>
<p>There are six student residence halls including <a>Memorial</a> (1914), <a>James Lide Coker III</a> (1962), <a>Belk</a> (1916), <a>Coker</a> (1916) and <a>Grannis</a> (1969), which all adjoin the Linville Dining Hall (1916).
<a>Richard and Tuck Coker Hall</a> (1988), commonly called the RTC, lies between the library and the other residence halls.
Despite the age of these structures, most have been recently remodeled and are fully modernized.
The Dining Hall offers three meals a day that range from light healthy fare to hearty &quot;homecooking.&quot;
Memorial Hall houses the Drawing Room, a ballroom/dining hall for special events.</p>
<p>In the Coker Residence Hall's basement one finds The Cobra Den and The Cobra Pit &#x2014; the on-campus spot for night life.
Open nightly, The Pit offers students the luxury of playing pool or watching television without having to leave the residence halls.
The Cobra Den serves as the venue for the faculty Academic Karaoke lectures, and on the weekend, The Den has resident DJs.</p>
<p>The residence halls are protected by locking rooms, ID card swipe building entry and 24-hour security guards that patrol the campus.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>In January 2008, students began using the <a>Charles W. and Joan S. Coker Library-Information Technology Center</a>.
This  state-of-the-art building replaces the James Lide Coker III Library, which will be remodeled into an upscale residence hall.
The new library was built entirely from donations from a capital campaign and is an example of Coker alumni generosity to the college.</p>
<h3>Health Services</h3>
<p><a>Coker Student Health Services</a> is housed in the residence halls, near the Dining Hall.
An RN is on-site to aid with general injuries and treatments and to make referrals to physicians as needed.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Adjacent to the main campus is a  athletics complex with baseball, softball, soccer and tennis facilities.
Near the athletics fields on East Carolina Avenue are the Saleeby House, home to Coker's athletics program, and the Department of Education Building.
</p>
<p>The college has 12 varsity athletics programs which compete in <a>Conference Carolinas</a>.
They include Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Volleyball, Tennis, Golf, Soccer and Cross Country.
As Coker was originally a Women's college, there was no history of a football squad; this, along with the high costs of starting and maintaining a team, helps explain why Coker has no varsity football team today.</p>
<p>As part of its focus on the future, Coker plans to build a brand-new Athletics facility on the south side of campus (Carolina Ave).</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p>Coker&#x2019;s alumni giving percentage - a gauge of alumni satisfaction - recently reached 52%, highest among all of South Carolina's colleges and universities and equal to the top 25 liberal arts colleges nationally.
Coker&#x2019;s alumni giving percentage is typically 24% to 34% - higher than most of the South&#x2019;s Best Comprehensive Colleges.</li>

Carolina Festival.
</p>
<p>The fourth weekend of every March, the <a>RenoFest</a> comes to Hartsville with excellent bluegrass music from a wide variety of bands from around the country.
</p>
<p>Because of the enormous wealth that Sonoco and other industries have brought to the town, there are many businesses that one would not normally find in a town of this size.
Also, Coker students help invigorate the downtown economy, attracting businesses that lend it a young and vibrant atmosphere.
Most notable among these locations is the <a>Midnight Rooster</a>, a downtown Hartsville coffeeshop.</p>

Kalmia Gardens hosts numerous community events and contains biking and walking trails that are open to the public.</p>
<h3>Vista Railyard Project</h3>
<p>Along the campus's eastern edge, through the cooperation of several entities, the City of <a>Hartsville</a> will build the Vista Railyard Project.
