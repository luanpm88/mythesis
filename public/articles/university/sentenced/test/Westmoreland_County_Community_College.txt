<p>WCCC was founded in 1970, during an era of community college proliferation within the state.
It was designed to complement the large <a>Community College of Allegheny County</a> and similar but smaller <a>Community College of Beaver County</a> and <a>Butler County Community College</a>.
It's location on the suburban fringe was designed to attract students from both the Westmoreland County suburbs of Pittsburgh and the <a>Monongahela Valley</a>, then a still booming industrial center.
WCCC has also extended its outreach to provide services to students from Fayette, Somerset, and Armstrong Counties.
</p>
<p>The college has four main buildings: Founder's Hall, Commissioner's Hall, Business and Industry Center, and Science Hall.
Currently, 54 associate degrees, as well as 48 certificate programs are available on-site.
A satellite learning center campus was established in <a>New Kensington</a> in 2008 to complement a long active facility in <a>Rostraver Township</a>.</p>
