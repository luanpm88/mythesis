<p> <a>thumb|Plaza and Music Building</a> <strong>Lehman College</strong> is one of the constituent <a>college</a>s of the <a>City University of New York</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Founded in 1931 as the <a>Bronx</a> campus of <a>Hunter College</a>, the school became an independent college within the City University in 1968.
The college is named after <a>Herbert Lehman</a>, a former <a>New York</a> governor, <a>United States</a> senator, and philanthropist.
It is a public, comprehensive, coeducational liberal arts college with more than 90 undergraduate and graduate degree programs and specializations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus).
During the <a>Second World War</a>, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the <a>United States Navy</a> who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as <a>WAVES</a> and <a>SPARS</a>.
The last of its graduates Sgt.
<a>Miriam Cohen</a> died in 2009, bringing an end to the era.

When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent <a>United Nations</a>, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.</p>

</p>
<p>Lehman has a 37-acre (15 hectare) campus with a combination of <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> and <a>modern architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>The campus was the main national training ground for women in the military during <a>World War II</a>.</p>
<p>It was also the interim headquarters for the newly formed <a>United Nations</a> for six months in 1946.
</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, a new postmodern-style gymnasium was opened, the Apex, standing in contrast to the Gothic revival buildings that define the campus.</p>
<p>The Lehman Center for the Performing Arts is a  professional theater.

<h3>Lehman Scholars Program</h3>
<p>The Lehman Scholars Program (L.S.P.) is designed for capable and highly motivated students who have the desire and ability to pursue a somewhat more independent liberal arts course of study.
The program offers the advantages of a small, intimate college, including special courses, seminars, and individual counseling.</p>
<p>The Lehman Scholars Program offers several special features, first being that students are exempt from all Degree Requirements.
They must, however, pass the CUNY Skills Assessment Tests to be admitted to the program and meet all course prerequisites and requirements for their major field.</p>
<p>The Lehman Scholars Program has its own requirements, which students must fulfill: a one-semester honors course in English composition and stylistics; two years of a foreign language at the college level or its equivalent; four honors seminars from any of four different academic areas: Fine and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Science; and a senior honors essay.</p>
<p>Students who enter the program with more than 30 credits may be considered for exemption from one seminar after consultation with the Program Director, Professor Gary Schwartz.</p>
<p>Mentors: Each student entering the program will be assigned to a faculty mentor in his or her field of interest.
The mentor will advise the student in the areas of program planning and academic and career goals.</p>
<p>Application Procedure: Students who have earned 60 or fewer college credits may apply for either September, June, or January admission.
They will be notified about their acceptance in time for the following semester's registration.[<a>http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/lehman/programs/undergrad-bulletin/1635.htm</a>]</p>
<h3>College Now</h3>

<h3>Freshman Year Initiative</h3>
<p>The <strong>Freshman Year Initiative</strong> is a program involving &quot;blocks&quot; of classes, similar to many high schools, which allows for new and first year students to get to know each other and become familiar with the college environment.
All first-year students participate in the program, which promotes an interdisciplinary curriculum, faculty collaboration, and peer support.
All students take mathematics and writing courses as well as a Freshman Seminar when they arrive to prepare them for the rest of their college courses.</p>
