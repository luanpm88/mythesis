<p>  The <strong>University of Hertfordshire</strong> is a university based largely in <a>Hatfield</a>, in the county of <a>Hertfordshire</a>, England, from which the university takes its name.
It has more than 24,500 students.
In the 2008 <a>RAE</a> the university was ranked 58th out of 138 UK institutions, and over 85 per cent of the submitted research was judged to be of international quality in terms of originality, significance and rigour </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1951, the <a>de Havilland</a> company gave land in Hatfield adjoining the <a>A1</a> to <a>Hertfordshire County Council</a> for educational use in perpetuity; the Council used this to build and operate <strong>Hatfield Technical College</strong>, which trained aerospace engineers for Hatfield's then-dominant <a>aerospace</a> <a>industry</a>.
In 1967 it became an early <a>polytechnic</a>, <strong>The Hatfield Polytechnic</strong>.
With the passage of the <a>Further and Higher Education Act, 1992</a>, the institution gained university status.&lt;!--</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>There are four campuses of University of Hertfordshire.</p>
<ul>
  <li>College Lane Campus.</li>
<li>Bywaters Campus.</li>
<li>De Havilland Campus, also a <a>Saracens</a> training ground and business campus</li>
  <li><a>St Albans</a> Campus, also a law campus</li>
</ul>
<p>The main site of the university remains the College Lane campus, which houses the original Hatfield Technical College building, though the site has had many new buildings added since.
Notable among these is the Learning Resources Centre, a combined library and computer centre.
Computer Science, Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Health &amp; Human Sciences are all based on this campus, as are a substantial collection of halls of residence and student houses, and the University of Hertfordshire Students' Union.</p>
<p>de Havilland campus is situated within 15&nbsp;minutes walk of College Lane, and is built on a former <a>BAe</a> site.
The Business School and the faculty of Humanities and Education are based here, along with another LRC.
The Law School is based in <a>St Albans</a>, near to the law courts.
There were formerly campuses in <a>Watford</a> (Wall Hall) and <a>Hertford</a> (Balls Park), but these were closed when the de Havilland campus opened.
A fourth site in <a>Bayfordbury</a> houses the university's observatory and the <a>biology</a> plus geography field stations.
The University has particular research strengths in History, Computer Science, Astrophysics and especially Engineering given the university's history in training Aerospace Engineers as a polytechnic.</p>
<p>The University of Hertfordshire Students' Union (UHSU) hosts frequent events at the College Lane campus.
These formerly took place in the Union's Hutton Hall or the peculiarly shaped building commonly known as the &quot;Elehouse&quot;, named due to its original architecture being similar to the elephant house at <a>London Zoo</a>.
'The Forum', a new student social space offering an entertainment venue, bars, shops, and caf&#x00e9;s, opened in October 2009.</p>
<p>The University of Hertfordshire is also home to <a>HIBT</a>, part of the <a>Navitas</a> group, providing a direct pathway for international students to the university, on campus.

<h2>Faculties</h2>
<p>Hertfordshire was described as &quot;the flagship of the former polys&quot; by the <em>Independent</em> in 2002.
As a polytechnic, it was strong in <a>aerospace engineering</a> and <a>computer science</a>.
More recently, it has built up its strengths in other areas such as <a>pharmacology</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>geography</a> and <a>astrophysics</a>.
Entry requirements have been rising in recent years.
The university has five <a>faculties</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business School</li>
  <li>Faculty of Science, Engineering and Creative Arts <em>(formerly 'Creative and Cultural Industries' and 'Engineering and Information Sciences')</em></li>
  <li>Faculty of Health and Human Sciences</li>
  <li>Humanities, Law and Education</li>
  <li>Computer Science is accredited by the <a>British Computer Society</a> (BCS)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Schools of Study)</p>
<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p>The university has invested <a>&#x00a3;</a> 200 million over the last ten years in developing facilities on the two main campuses, including the new de Havilland campus in Hatfield (opened 2003/2004), the Learning Resources Centre on the College Lane campus, the Hertfordshire Sports Village, new teaching laboratories in most Schools, including a state-of-the-art medical simulation centre called <a>HICESC</a> (Hertfordshire Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Simulation Centre), and most recently the Forum, opening in academic year 2009/10.</p>
<h2>Paramedic Science</h2>
<p>Hertfordshire was one of the first universities in the country to develop a Paramedic Science degree.
They are now also providing a Critical Care Paramedic course and an Emergency Care Practitioner course.
The university still provides BSc (Hons), BSc, FdSc, and Diploma level Paramedic courses.
The University's 4 year Paramedic Science course also features a period of elective study which can be undertaken anywhere in the world, and a sandwich year working for the Ambulance Service.
The university is also among the first four universities in the country to offer the <a>Postgraduate Diploma</a> in <a>Physician Assistant</a> studies, and the first in the UK to offer the option of an <a>MSc</a> in the field.</p>
<h2>Racing team</h2>
<p>The University of Hertfordshire has one of the most successful <a>Formula Student</a> teams in the world.
UH Racing have competed in many countries and have won many awards.
The UH Racing cars can accelerate from 0-60&nbsp;mph in less than 3&nbsp;seconds and pull over 2g in the corners.
Students from the Engineering degrees can join the team, with students from the Sports Science, Marketing, Art and Business Schools playing a vital role.
There are over 400 universities that race at Formula Student events worldwide, with UH finishing in the top 10 consistently.</p>

<h2>University symbols</h2>
<h3>Academic dress</h3>
<p>The University of Hertfordshire prescribes <a>academic dress</a> for its members.
Both dress and undress are prescribed, though only dress is used in practice - for example, at the graduation ceremonies, held in <a>St Albans Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>The academic dress of bachelors of the university is a black <a>stuff</a> gown, with facings and long open sleeves gathered to a point at the elbow with a button.
The master's gown is similar, but with spade sleeves.
With these, on formal occasions such as graduations, is worn a hood of grey or white silk and stuff.
In dress, grey hoods are worn by holders of diplomas below bachelor's level, and white hoods by bachelors.
Masters add a border of purple silk.
Because of the university's emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, there is no distinction between the academic dress of the various faculties.</p>
<p>In dress, holders of initial doctorates wear red gowns with purple facings; higher doctorates have purple gowns with white facings.
In undress all doctors wear master's gowns.
The university is unusual among former polytechnics in also prescribing academic dress for undergraduates - the black stuff bachelor's gown with no hood - although, again, this is not used in practice.</p>
<h3>Coat of arms</h3>
<p>The University's <a>coat of arms</a> was granted in 1992.
The shield is charged with an oak tree taken from the coat of arms of the former <a>Hatfield Rural District</a>, the constellation <a>Perseus</a> and a representation of the letter &quot;H&quot; recalling the emblem of the former Hatfield Polytechnic.
The crest, a <a>Phoenix</a>, represents the University's origin in the aviation industry.
The two harts supporting the shield represent the County of Hertfordshire.
A scroll bears the motto &quot;Seek Knowledge Throughout Life&quot;.</p>
<h3>Ceremonial mace</h3>
<p>The <a>ceremonial mace</a> was produced in 1999 by craftsman Martyn Pugh.
Its design symbolises the University's origins, expertise and associations.
Its shape is inspired by the shape of an aeroplane wing symbolising the university's origin in the aviation industry.
The head of the mace is engraved with zodiac symbols representing the university's contribution to astronomy and also contains the DNA double helix representing the biological sciences and microprocessor chips representing information and communications technology.</p>
