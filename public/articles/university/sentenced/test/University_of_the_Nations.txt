<p>The <strong>University of the Nations</strong> (U of N) is a global <a>Christian</a> <a>university</a> with branch campuses in 600 locations in 142 countries, providing coursework in over 100 languages around the world.
Its largest locations are in <a>Kona, Hawaii</a> (USA), <a>Jeju</a>, South Korea, and <a>Perth, Australia</a>.
The University of the Nations operates under the <a>umbrella organization</a> of the <a>Youth With A Mission</a> (YWAM) network.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The institution was founded in 1978 as Pacific &amp; Asia Christian University (PACU) by <a>Howard Malmstadt</a>, widely known as the &quot;father of modern electronic and computerized instrumentation in chemistry&quot;, and <a>Loren Cunningham</a>, the founder of <a>Youth with a Mission</a>, in <a>Kailua-Kona, Hawaii</a>.
As other locations were established around the world, PACU was renamed the University of the Nations in 1989.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>The U of N offers <a>Associate's degree</a>s, <a>Bachelor's degree</a>s, <a>Graduate Diploma</a>s and <a>Master's degree</a>s from its seven <a>college</a>s.
These colleges are the College of the Arts and Sports, College of Christian Ministries, College of Communication, College of Counseling and Health Care, College of Education, College of Humanities and International Studies, and the College of Science and Technology.
There are also five interdisciplinary centers: the Community Development Center; the Center for Discipleship Training Schools; the Family Resource Center; the Student Mobilization Center; and the GENESIS Center.</p>
<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<p>University of the Nations is <a>not accredited</a> by any recognized accreditation body.
As such, its degrees and credits might not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and use of degree titles may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>University of the Nations justifies its lack of accreditation by stating that &quot;validation by an accrediting agency in one nation could be limiting.
With the U of N, students may begin their education in South America, continue it in the United States and complete their U of N degree requirements in Europe.
This type of international scope is a challenge for accrediting agencies to validate.&quot;
University of the Nations asserts that many institutions have accepted and continue to accept <a>transfer credit</a>s.</p>
