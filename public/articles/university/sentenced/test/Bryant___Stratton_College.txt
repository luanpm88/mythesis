<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Bryant, brother John Bryant</a> <a>thumb|right|Stratton, brother-in-law of John Bryant</a> John Collins Bryant, Henry Beadman Bryant, and Henry Dwight Stratton were early graduates of <strong>Folsom Business College</strong> in Cleveland, Ohio, which they later purchased from the owner of the school, Ezekiel G. Folsom, who founded his school in 1848.
Folsom was a former student of <a>Platt Rogers Spencer</a> who developed a standardized style of writing useful in business transactions before the invention of the typewriter.
Platt Spencer also played a role in the formation of Bryant &amp; Stratton College serving as a partner and teacher at the school which originally focused on bookkeeping and standardized penmanship.
Bryant &amp; Stratton College was organized in 1854 to provide practical workplace education, and was formerly known as <strong>Bryant and Stratton Business Institute</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to purchasing the Cleveland school, Bryant and Stratton established a number of business schools that operated under the name of Bryant &amp; Stratton &amp; Co's chain of International Commercial Colleges in most major US cities.
By 1864 as many as 50 schools existed.
Tuition was $40 for an entire program of study.</p>
<p>Several other institutions trace their roots to Bryant &amp; Stratton, including <a>Bryant University</a>.
and <a>Chancellor University</a>.
Chancellor University is the original Cleveland school, Folsom Business School, which was sold several times and later renamed Spencarian College, then Dyke College, later David N. Myers College and now Chancellor University.</p>
