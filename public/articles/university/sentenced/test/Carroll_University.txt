<p><strong>Carroll University</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> affiliated with the <a>Presbyterian</a> church located in <a>Waukesha</a> in the <a>U.S. state</a> of <a>Wisconsin</a>.
Carroll opened in 1846, two years before Wisconsin became a state.
Before July 1, 2008, Carroll University was known as Carroll College.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Carroll University claims to be the oldest college in Wisconsin, however this claim is also held by <a>Beloit College</a>.
</p>
<p>Prairieville Academy, which eventually became Carroll College (and subsequently Carroll University), was founded in 1841 by <a>Increase Lapham</a>.
Three years later, in summer of 1844, the genesis for Beloit College came in the form of a group of New Englanders calling themselves &quot;Friends of Education,&quot; who gathered to discuss the formation of a &quot;frontier college.&quot;</p>
<p>The charter for Carroll &#x2013; named for <a>Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, Maryland, a signer of the <a>United States Declaration of Independence</a> &#x2013; was passed into law by the Wisconsin Territorial Legislation on January 31, 1846.
Beloit's charter followed shortly on February 2, giving rise to Carroll's claim to be the oldest four-year institution in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Beloit's claim is often phrased &quot;the oldest college in the state in continuous operation,&quot; with a particular emphasis on the &quot;continuous operation&quot; aspect.
During the 1860s, the <a>American Civil War</a> and financial difficulty caused Carroll to temporarily suspend operations, while Beloit has offered classes continuously since 1847.</p>
<p>In 2009, Carroll was ranked 175th out of 600 by <a>Forbes</a> on their list of America's Best Colleges.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Carroll University offers more than 60 areas of study at an <a>undergraduate</a> level and Master's degrees and certificates in selected subjects, as well as one clinical doctorate program in physical therapy.
There are 96 full-time faculty members and approximately 3,325 students from 28 states and 27 countries.</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p>: <em>See <a>List of Carroll Pioneers head football coaches</a></em> The <a>college football</a> program at Carroll began in the late 1890s.
Past head coaches include <a>Glenn Thistlethwaite</a>, <a>Vince DiFrancesca</a>, and <a>Matty Bell</a>.
The current coach is <a>Henny Hiemenz</a>.</p>
<p>A notable event in <a>American football</a> history occurred at Carroll on September 5, 1906, when <a>Saint Louis University</a> player <a>Bradbury Robinson</a>, coached by <a>Eddie Cochems</a>, threw the first legal <a>forward pass</a> in football history.</p>
<h3>Basketball (men's and women's</h3>
<p>In 2006, both the men's and women's basketball teams qualified for the NCAA Division III tournament for the first time in school history.
The women won the Midwest Conference tournament and received the automatic bid, while the men's team received an &quot;at-large&quot; bid.
Both were eliminated in the first round of play.
</p>
<p>In 2007, both teams again qualified for the tournament.
The Pioneers endured a long road to win the Midwest Conference tournament, including freak power outages that forced the championship game to be delayed and moved twice (first to <a>Monmouth College</a>, then to nearby <a>Knox College</a>).
Upon reaching the NCAA tournament, they defeated 7th-ranked <a>Augustana College</a> in the first round of play, and 5th-ranked <a>University of St. Thomas</a>, to advance to the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; sectional level.
The women received an at-large bid to the tournament, defeating <a>Illinois Wesleyan University</a> in the first round, but losing in the second round of play to 25th-ranked <a>Luther College</a>.</p>
