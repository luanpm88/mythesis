<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early twentieth century as a <a>women's college</a>.
The Young Women's Industrial Club, formed in 1903 by <a>Lucy Ann Skidmore</a> (1853&#x2013;1931) with inheritance money from her husband who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821&#x2013;1882), a former coal merchant.
In 1911, the club was chartered under the name &quot;Skidmore School of Arts&quot; as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women.</p>
<p><a>Charles Henry Keyes</a> became the first president of the school in 1912, and in 1919 Skidmore conferred its first baccalaureate degrees under the authority of the State University of New York.
By 1922 the school had been chartered independently as a four-year, degree-granting college.</p>
<p>Skidmore College was first located in downtown <a>Saratoga Springs</a>, but on October 28, 1961, the college began to move to the Jonsson Campus,  of land on the outer edges of Saratoga Springs.
The Jonsson Campus was named for the Skidmore trustee <a>Erik Jonsson</a>, the founder and president of <a>Texas Instruments</a> and a former mayor of <a>Dallas, Texas</a> (1964&#x2013;71).</p>
<p>Trustee Josephine Young Case delivered a challenge on the development of the new campus, a speech which to this day guides Skidmore's development.
For example, on Scribner Library she wrote, &quot;And at the heart of the beating center, you must set the library where every book wanted is immediately at hand, and a thousand others wait beside them to be discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>1971 was an important year for Skidmore.
For the first time, the college began admitting men to its regular undergraduate program (a few dozen male <a>World War II</a> veterans had been admitted in 1946 - 49).
Skidmore also launched an innovative program called the &quot;University Without Walls&quot; (UWW), which allows nonresident students over the age of 25 to earn bachelors degrees.
Finally, Skidmore established a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.</p>
<p>In 1988, Skidmore faculty formed the Collaborative Research Program, which provides students with opportunities to co-author papers and studies with professors.
Skidmore began granting masters degrees in 1991 through its Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) program.
The Skidmore Honors Forum was founded in 1998.</p>
<p>2006 marked the start of the largest campaign in Skidmore's history, named: <em>Creative Thought.
Bold Promise.</em>
The goal is to raise $200 million, and as of November 15, 2009 $194 million had been raised.</p>

<h2>Campus and facilities</h2>
<p>Most of the buildings on Skidmore's  campus were constructed after 1960.
Consequently, the grounds have a contemporary ambience that is enhanced by the numerous sculptures and murals that decorate the quads and other common areas.</p>
<p>&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: <a>thumb|left|Architectural model of the Tang Museum.</a>
--&gt; The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery is the college's most prominent arts facility.
In addition to the Tang, Skidmore has substantial undergraduate studio space as well as several smaller galleries.
The Saisselin Art Building houses studios for animation, ceramics, communication design, drawing, fibers, metals, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture.
Skidmore has a well-known music program and is currently building a large concert hall with state-of-the art facilities to replace its current music building.</p>
<p>Most humanities classes are held in one of four academic buildings: Palamountain, Tisch, Bolton, and Ladd.
Harder Hall houses math and computer science; geology, chemistry, physics, and biology operate out of Dana Science Center.
Almost every classroom at Skidmore is equipped with a computer and a projector, and many contain other audiovisual equipment such DVD players and slide projectors.
The average class size is 16 (generally smaller in lab courses) and the typical student-to-teacher ratio is 11:1.</p>
<p>&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: <a>thumb|right|Scribner Library.</a>
--&gt; The Lucy Scribner Library, which houses approximately half a million volumes, is notable for both its function and beauty.
Its five floors contain a large computer lab, approximately sixty open computers on the main floor, classrooms, private offices for seniors who are working on theses, and many areas for individual and group study.
A substantial collection of rare books is kept in the third floor Pohndorff Room.
The third floor is home to a children's library which is used by Saratoga residents.
Also present is the Help Desk where students can get help with their computers.
A helpful service offered by the library is the inter-library loan; students can put in a request for a book found at another college and have it sent to Skidmore free of charge.</p>
<p>Skidmore maintains nine on-campus residence halls (Howe Hall, Jonsson Tower, Kimball Hall, McClellan Hall, Penfield Hall, Rounds Hall, Wait Hall, Wiecking Hall and Wilmarth Hall) and two on-campus apartment complexes (North Woods Village and Scribner Village).</p>
<p>Residence Hall rooms at Skidmore are quite large and the college usually appears on the Princeton Review's &quot;Dorms Like Palaces&quot; list.Most residence halls are arranged in suite style with 3 or 4 bedrooms sharing one common bathroom.
The exception to this is Wiecking Hall which is Skidmore's only corridor-style building.
Most suites are single sex.
Gender-neutral housing is available in Wiecking Hall, the Scribner Village and North Woods apartments, and select suites during room selection.</p>
<p>The North Woods Apartments are available to juniors and seniors and can hold 380 people in 3- and 4-person apartments.
The Scribner Village apartments are available to most students except incoming freshmen.
They house from 4 to 7 people.</p>
<p>Much of Skidmore's property is taken up by North Woods, a  forest that adjoins the academic campus and reaches up to the bottom of the Adirondack mountains.
The woods contain extensive hiking trails that are open to the general public.</p>
<h3>The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|The exterior of the Tang Museum.</a>
--&gt; &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>thumb|right|The Malloy Wing.</a> --&gt; The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery was opened in 2000, and was designed by the  architect <a>Antoine Predock</a>.
Predock's striking, innovative design includes two major gallery wings (the Wachenheim Gallery and the Malloy Wing), two smaller galleries (the State Farm Mezzanine and the Winter Gallery), digitally-equipped classrooms, and several event spaces.
The Tang is nationally known for both its architecture and its holdings, and its excellence has been recognized by the <em><a>New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>Art in America</a></em>, and <em><a>Architectural Digest</a></em>, among other publications.</p>
<p>The Tang has a private collection of over 5,000 works, including pieces by <a>Rembrandt van Rijn</a>, <a>Albrecht D&#x00fc;rer</a>, <a>Francisco de Goya</a>, <a>William Hogarth</a>, <a>Roy Lichtenstein</a>, <a>Andy Warhol</a>, <a>Garry Winogrand</a>, <a>W.
Eugene Smith</a>, <a>Eugene Atget</a>, <a>Dorothy Dehner</a>, <a>David Smith</a>, <a>Nayland Blake</a>, and <a>Nan Goldin</a>.
The museum also maintains extensive collections of art from Africa, South Asia, China, and the Americas.</p>
<p>An ambitious program of relevant, scholarly exhibitions is perhaps the Tang's greatest draw.
Artists who have shown at the Tang include <a>Kara Walker</a>, Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, <a>Trisha Brown</a>, and Richard Pettibone.
Among other recent exhibitions are &quot;Brushing the Present: Contemporary Academy Painting from China&quot;, &quot;From Pop to Now: Selections from the Sonnabend Collection&quot;, &quot;The World According to the Newest and Most Exact Observations: Mapping Art and Science&quot;, &quot;Work: Shaker Design and Recent Art&quot;, and &quot;Molecules that Matter&quot;.</p>
<p>The Tang is an educational center as well as a museum.
Skidmore classes regularly meet in the galleries and classrooms, and groups from other schools visit to view exhibits, hear lectures, watch powerpoint presentations, and participate in workshops.
Tours, demonstrations, and other events are generally open to the general public.
In addition to visual arts exhibitions, the Tang often hosts plays, musical performances, and dance recitals.</p>
<h3>Arthur Zankel Music Center</h3>
<p>Because of a record-breaking donation made by the estate of Arthur Zankel, Skidmore received $46 million, a portion of which was used as a lead gift to make the state of the art Arthur Zankel Music Center.[<a>http://cms.skidmore.edu/zankel/arthurzankel.cfm</a>] Designed by Ewing Cole, the building has won awards even before it was built.
Most notably, it is lauded for its environmentally friendly nature.
For example, rain water is collected on the roof and turned into usable water in restrooms.[<a>http://www.skidmore.edu/administration/plant/music.htm</a>]</p>
<h3>Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater</h3>
<p>Janet Kinghorn Bernhard '26, while a senior at Skidmore, became the first editor of the Skidmore News.

They were both present in 1987 to see their long-awaited dream come true, at the dedication of the Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater.
The facility has a main theater, with 300 seats, that is the site of most major productions, as well as a convertible black-box space.
The main theater is also the home of the annual National College Comedy Festival.[<a>http://www.skidmore.edu/map/bernhard.htm</a>] the Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater was named the  #17 Best College Theater by princeton review.</p>
<h3>Dining facilities</h3>
<p>A new dining hall was opened in Fall 2006 with futuristic architecture and a new kitchen which has greatly improved food quality.
The new dining hall offers a variety of food selections including 7 food sections; The Global Caf&#x00e9; (foods from around the world), Semolina (pasta), Emily's Garden (salad bar and Vegan options),  The Diner (more typical college foods), The Corner Deli (custom made sandwiches and wraps), Dessert, and Supremo's (pizza).
The Pizza section has a brand new wood burning oven that is warm and earthy, contrasting with the rest of the dining hall's modern design.
Also available is a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; station where patrons can use a large griddle or waffle machines.</p>
<h3>Campus Plan</h3>
<p>Lo-Yi Chan, architect and campus planner, and apprentice of famous architect I M Pei has created Skidmore's next major Campus Plan.
