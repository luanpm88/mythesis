<p><strong>Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology</strong> is a publicly funded <a>English</a>-language college and member of <a>Polytechnics Canada</a> located in  <a>Ottawa</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>.
The college serves the <a>National Capital Region</a> and the outlying areas of <a>Eastern Ontario</a> and Western <a>Quebec</a>.
The college has three campuses; a primary campus located in West Ottawa, and secondary campuses located in <a>Perth, Ontario</a>, and <a>Pembroke, Ontario</a>.
The enabling legislation is the <em>Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act.</em> </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The college was established during the formation of Ontario&#x2019;s college system in 1967.
Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965 when the Ontario system of public community colleges was created.
The founding institutions were the Eastern Ontario Institute of Technology (established in 1957) and the Ottawa Vocational Centre (established in 1965 at the Woodroffe Campus).
The original land was donated by the Ryan family.
Algonquin College is named after the <a>Algonquin</a> First Nations Peoples who were the original inhabitors of the area.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Rideau Campus was established.
&#x201c;Satellite&#x201d; campuses in <a>Pembroke</a>, <a>Hawkesbury</a>, <a>Perth</a> and <a>Renfrew</a> were established in the late 1960s.
The Vanier School of Nursing became a part of the Woodroffe Campus when <a>nursing</a> programs began to be offered at the college.
In 1973, the School of Prescott-Russell joined the Algonquin family and the Colonel By Campus was created through the acquisition of St. Patrick&#x2019;s College.
With the creation of <a>La Cit&#x00e9; Coll&#x00e9;giale</a>, 1990 marked the beginning of Algonquin as an <a>English</a> college.
In August 2002, the Rideau Campus closed and programs were moved to the Advanced Technology Centre on the Woodroffe Campus.</p>
<p>Bachelor degrees in Applied Studies were introduced.
Despite having three degree programs and offering three additional degrees through affiliations with the University of Ottawa and Carleton University the college has not been designated an Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning.</p>
<h2>Woodroffe Campus expansion</h2>
<p>Scheduled to open in the fall of 2011, the  Algonquin Centre for Construction Excellence will house 600 additional construction seats and provide space for thousands more students studying in related programs.
The uniquely green, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certified building will also be a showcase and teaching laboratory for best practices in sustainable construction.
The new facility will integrate the relocated bus station and a new below-grade transit roadway to the main campus via a $4 million pedestrian bridge to be constructed across Woodroffe Avenue.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The college's mission is &quot;to provide high quality, career-oriented education and training, which respond to the needs of learners, to the community, and to society&quot;.</p>
