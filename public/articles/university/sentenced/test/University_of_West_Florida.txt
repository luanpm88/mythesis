The university's mascot is an <a>Argonaut</a>, and the school's logo is the <a>Chambered Nautilus</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|225px|Foliage at UWF</a> <a>thumb|225px|The entrance of the John C. Pace library</a> In 1955, the Florida Legislature authorized the State Board of Education to locate a state university in <a>Escambia County</a>.
Following a feasibility study which demonstrated the need for an institution of higher education in Northwest Florida, funds were allocated for the development of the University of West Florida.
The founding President was <a>Harold Crosby</a>.
UWF became the sixth state university of the <a>State University System of Florida</a>, which today consists of eleven institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>Ground was broken on April 16, 1965, and in the same year the <a>Chambered Nautilus</a> was adopted as the official UWF emblem.
The initial building program, consisted of an administration classroom complex, library, Commons building, science complex, humanities building, audiovisual facility, utilities building and 15 student housing buildings accommodating approximately 500 resident students.
Current facilities at UWF include: 35 academic buildings, 21 student services facilities, 25 dormitories, two university village student apartment complexes and 20 plant support facilities.
In 1997,  additional were acquired which brought the <a>Pensacola</a> campus to , the second largest main campus in the State University System.</p>
<p>Initially, the university was organized in three resident or cluster colleges: Alpha, Gamma and Omega.
Not only were academic disciplines assigned to these colleges, but <a>student government</a>, cultural programs and other activities were conducted within the colleges.
UWF was originally an upper-level institution enrolling juniors, seniors, and graduate students.
The first students began classes in the fall of 1967, and the first commencement exercises were held in June 1968 where 58 students received degrees.
In 1969, the university undergraduate programs were accredited by <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS) and the first master's degree programs were established.</p>
<p>In July 1979, the university organized in a more traditional structure by establishing three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business and Education.
Following authorization by the <a>Florida Legislature</a>, a lower division was established, and freshmen attended the university for the first time in the fall semester of 1983, boosting enrollment from 5,200 students to 5,920 students.</p>
<p>In July 1988, <a>Computer Science</a>, a department within the College of Business, was identified as the Division of <a>Computer Science</a> as a stand alone and plans were begun to incorporate it into a fourth college, the College of Science and Technology.
That decision was later reversed and computer science was moved to the School of Computer Science and Engineering within the College of Arts and Sciences.
During the fall term of 1999, the colleges reorganized as the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and the College of Professional Studies.</p>

<h3>Main campuses</h3>
<p>The main campus of  of rolling hills and natural woodland along the <a>Escambia River</a> is ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of downtown <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>.
Its facilities have been designed to complement the natural forest and waterways.
On the main campus can be found the <a>John C. Pace Library</a>.
It is the largest library in the <a>Northwest Florida</a> area.
In addition to the main library on the main campus north of <a>Pensacola, Florida</a>, there is a branch library in <a>Fort Walton Beach, Florida</a>.
It has 628,000 printed volumes, 1 million <a>microfilm</a>s and <a>microfiche</a>s, 3,000 serial subscriptions and nearly 2,000 online journal subscriptions.
UWF shares a branch campus in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with <a>Okaloosa-Walton College</a>, and has several centers and sites where academic programs and/or courses are taught.
In addition, the University of West Florida has waterfront property on <a>Santa Rosa Island</a> that is available for recreational, academic, and research pursuits.
The University also operates the NWFSC/UWF Fort Walton Beach Campus, the <a>Eglin Air Force Base</a> Center and the <a>Hurlburt Field</a> Center.
As a result, a significant number of UWF students have been military personnel assigned to <a>NAS Pensacola</a>, <a>NAS Whiting Field</a>, <a>Eglin AFB</a>, <a>Hurlburt Field</a> and <a>Duke Field</a>.
This is particularly true of commissioned officers at these installations pursuing postgraduate degrees outside of their normal duty hours.</p>
<h3>Online Campus</h3>
<p>UWF also maintains an <a><strong>Online Campus</strong></a> with over <strong>400 online course sections</strong> and <strong>27 fully online undergraduate, graduate and certificate programs</strong> that are available to students anywhere in the world.
Acceptance to any of the fully online degree or certificate programs provides an <strong>out-of-state tuition waiver</strong> that reduces out-of-state tuition to near that of in-state.
The Online Campus provides students with an additional way to access education at UWF whether completing courses far away from the campus or selecting to take an online course to round out a semester.</p>
<h3>Historic Pensacola Village</h3>
<p> In 2001, the university acquired <a>West Florida Historic Preservation, Inc</a>, the previously state-controlled group that manages the <a>Historic Pensacola Village</a>.
A few years later, <a>John C. Cavanaugh</a> became the fourth president on July 15, 2002.
Under his supervision the university has created several classes taught by and/or in conjunction with the staff at Historic Pensacola.
The <a>Clara Barkley Dorr House</a> was also appropriated as a downtown home for the institute president.</p>
<h2>Administration and organization</h2>
<p>The University of West Florida is a <a>public institution</a>, receiving most of its funding through state funds and <a>tuition</a>.
A 13-member <a>Board of Trustees</a> governs the University.
The undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into three Colleges, with the College of Arts and Sciences being the largest and most complex, followed by the College of Professional Studies, and finally the College of Business.</p>

89% of students are Florida residents, and 11% of students are non-Florida residents.
The University of West Florida and Jikei College Group in Japan established an educational partnership in 1989.
An official agreement was signed in January 1990 in Tokyo by Dr. Morris Marx, President of UWF, and Dr. Kunihiko Ukifune, Chairman and CEO of Jikei College Group.
The purpose of the partnership was to provide students, both American and Japanese, with opportunities to learn about each other's country.
On September 20, 1994, the office was formally named the Jikei-American Center and continues to be located on the main campus of UWF.
The collaboration between UWF and Jikei has set the model for international education.</p>
<h3>School of Science and Engineering</h3>
<p> In 2010 UWF opened a new multimillion dollar facility, home of the new School of Science and Engineering including the Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Statistics, Physics, and Software Engineering programs.</p>
<p>The building includes prototype robot fabrication and testing laboratories, 3-D virtual reality simulators, a state-of-the-art holo deck and a glass wall atrium that helps put science into public view.
This construction is based on <a>Project Kaleidoscope</a>, a national initiative funded project by the <a>National Science Foundation</a> and the <a>Keck Foundation</a>.
This collegiate facility is one of the first of its kind.</p>
<p>The building's mascot is a robot named PHLEN (PHenomenally Lifelike Eidetic Nerd) who is deployed to meet guests and give tours of the building's more advanced features.</p>
<h3>Underwater Archeology</h3>
<p>The shipwreck, which was discovered last summer in Pensacola Bay by two university students, is the remains of one of the colonization ships of the Tristan de Luna fleet that sank during a hurricane in 1559.
The prehistoric sites at which we have conducted the most extensive investigations are an Early Woodland Stage Deptford shell midden on Pensacola Bay known as Hawkshaw (50 B.C.-A.D. 250) and a Middle Woodland Santa Rosa-Swift Creek shell ring on Escambia Bay (A.D. 400-650).
UWF has one of the best underwater archaeology programs in the country because Pensacola has such rich, historically significant archaeological sites right in its own backyard.
UWF&#x2019;s graduate and undergraduate students gain hands-on experience that they simply would not have access to in other programs.
