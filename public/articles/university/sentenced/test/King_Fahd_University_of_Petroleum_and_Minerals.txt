The grading system is the standard 0 to 4.0 scale with classes of:</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>With an acceptance rate is only 15%, it is the most selective in Saudi Arabia.
The university's admission policy applies certain criteria to ensure admissions of the most promising students.
As of the 2010/2011 academic year, the cutoff percentage score for admission was determined to be 84% comprising 20% for the high school certificate, 30% for the general capabilities test (similar to <a>SAT</a>), and 50% for the collective test performances (test of high school's maths, physics, chemistry, English).</p>
<h3>Ranking</h3>
<p><a>THE - QS World University Rankings</a> ranked KFUPM at 255&nbsp;amongst the top 300 universities around the world (2010).</p>
<p>One of the best 500 universities around the world according to the famous world university ranking <a>ARWU</a> (2010).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All programs of the engineering colleges were evaluated for &quot;<a>Substantial-Equivalency</a>&quot; recognition by the <a>Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a> (ABET).
They were found substantially equivalent to similar accredited programs in the U.S.</p>
<p>The new trends in accreditation criteria have brought outcome assessment to focus.
Accrediting agencies such the ABET, the <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a>, the <a>Computer Science Accreditation Board</a> and the <a>National Architectural Accrediting Board</a> require programs or colleges seeking accreditation to have self-assessment.
Industry push and competitive job markets have also contributed to the need for continuous program-quality improvement that focus on student learning and preparation for professional practice after graduation.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Year Program (Orientation Year)</h3>
<p>Preparatory Year Program (Orientation Year) is a mandatory two-semester program for all students admitted to KFUPM before being enrolled in university's regular degree programs.
The Preparatory Year Program aims at preparing newly admitted students for their undergraduate studies at the university.
It is a non-credit program.
A student must select a major by the end of the prep year.
Students can be exempted from some courses after passing some promotion exams.

<h2>Dhahran Techno-Valley</h2>
<p><a>Dhahran Techno-Valley</a>[<a>http://dtv.kfupm.edu.sa</a>] is destined to gather national and international research centers in one location.
It is expected that outstanding services plus recreational activities will add to the vibrancy and networking amongst tenants in the Valley Community.
Academic support from KFUPM is a commitment that can be counted upon.
Other leading technological and scientific institutions in the area will also be fully used.
The Techno-Valley consist of five entities at the KFUPM Dhahran campus: King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Science Park, The Innovation Center, Consulting Services Center, Technology Business Incubator, and Liaison Office.
The valley includes a sixth entity of Sultan Bin AbdulAziz Science &amp; Technology Center (SciTech), located on the shores of the <a>Persian Gulf</a> at nearby <a>Al-Khobar</a> city.</p>
<h3>King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Science Park</h3>
<p>Generally referred to as the KASP, the science park was established in 2002 and is located on a 35-hectare site north of the KFUPM campus.
The park is closely integrated with the university.
With its proximity to the science and engineering colleges, KASP provides considerable interaction between tenant firms and their personnel and university scientists and engineers.
At present,  <a>Schlumberger</a>, <a>Ciba</a>, <a>Yokogawa</a>, <a>Honeywell</a>, <a>UOP</a>, <a>Baker Hughes</a> and <a>JCCP</a> have joined the park.</p>
<h3>Innovation Center</h3>
<p>Creating a world-class environment that aspires innovation and entrepreneurship was the main objective for <a>KFUPM</a> behind establishing Dhahran Techno-Valley.
KFUPM vision for <a>innovation</a> facilitates the flow of technology from university laboratories and research centers to the knowledge-based and technology marketplace.
The Innovation Center supports new concepts from the idea generation stage through the prototyping steps until reaching to the proof of concept and including the intellectual property protection.
The innovation vision of the university describes all the roads, distances, conditions and connections between where the entrepreneurs are and where they want to go.
It provides many alternative paths to future innovation and all university entrepreneurs.</p>
<h3>Consulting Services Center</h3>
<p>The Consulting Services Center facilitate the consulting services for the university faculty to serve the industrial community in  <a>Saudi Arabia</a> which contributes to their professional development and helps the outside community to resolve problems that require high intellectual and  technological background.
It is hoped that such interaction contributes to the professional development of the faculty members and to the university by providing practical applications and state-of-the art course content.
The interaction would improve quality of research and design projects and would provide more training and employment opportunities for students.</p>
<h3>Technology Business Incubator</h3>
<p>The Technology Business Incubator provides a set of logistical, strategic, and operational support for start-up Saudi technology companies and entrepreneurs to help increasing success of their companies.
It gives office space and office support services that are designed with technology companies in mind.
These services include immediate availability of modular office units, furniture, computers, network, internet connectivity, servers, printers, communication facilities including telephone and fax services, shared reception, secretarial, and support services, meeting facilities, access to business, science, and technology library, and access to cafeteria and leisure facilities.</p>
<h3>Liaison Office</h3>
<p>The mission of the Liaison Office is to facilitate and promote the University capabilities, expertise and services to the local industries and to be the focal point of contact with the industry/business.</p>
<h3><a>Sultan Bin AbdulAziz Science &amp; Technology Center (SciTech)</a></h3>
<p>The center is at the corniche of nearby <a>Khobar</a> city on &#x200e;&#x200e;21,700 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The buildings area is 14,100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It &#x200e;consists of seven main show halls, dealing with different sciences and &#x200e;technologies.
