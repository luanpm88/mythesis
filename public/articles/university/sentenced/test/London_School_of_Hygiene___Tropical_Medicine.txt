<p><a>thumb|Main entrance</a> The <strong>London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</strong> (LSHTM or the &quot;London School&quot;) is a constituent college of the <a>University of London</a>, specialising in <a>public health</a> and <a>tropical medicine</a>.
Founded by <a>Sir Patrick Manson</a> in 1899, London School is a research-led postgraduate centre of excellence in public health, international health and tropical medicine.
The School's mission is to contribute to the improvement of health worldwide through the pursuit of excellence in research, postgraduate teaching and advanced training in national and international public health and tropical medicine, and through informing policy and practice in these areas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Malet Street</a> The School was founded in 1899 by Sir <a>Patrick Manson</a> as the London School of Tropical Medicine and located at the <a>Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital</a> in the <a>London Docklands</a>.&lt;!--  --&gt;  Prior to this, courses in tropical medicine were conducted at the Extramural School at Edinburgh, and <a>Livingstone College</a> founded in London in 1893 by Charles F. Harford-Battersby (1865&#x2013;1925).
Before giving lectures at St. George's Hospital in 1895, Livingstone College afforded Manson his first opportunity to teach courses in tropical medicine.
Manson's early career was as a physician in the Far East where he deduced the correct aetiology of filariasis, a parasitic vector based disease, transmitted through the bite of a mosquito.
On his return to London, and after financial difficulties, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the Colonial Office.
He strongly believed that doctors should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain's tropical empire.
He also encouraged and mentored Ross during this period to uncover the correct aetiology of malaria, which Ross subsequently discovered in 1898, winning the Nobel Prize for his efforts.
The original School was established as part of the <a>Seamen's Hospital Society</a>, it has its origins in the hospital ships which were docked on the Thames at <a>Greenwich</a>.</p>
<p>In 1920 the School moved, with the <a>Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a>, to Endsleigh Gardens in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War.&lt;!--</p>
<pre> --&gt;</pre>
<p>In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine.
This enlarged School, now named the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1924.</p>
<p>The main School building is in Keppel Street in <a>Bloomsbury</a>.
This building was opened in 1929 by HRH the Prince of Wales.
The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.
A competition to design the new School building was held involving five architects, all experienced in laboratory design and construction.
This was won by Morley Horder and Verner Rees.</p>
<p>The School is part of the University of London and is the University's major resource for postgraduate teaching and research in public health and tropical medicine.
On successful completion of their studies, students gain a University of London degree.</p>
<h2>Academic Strengths and Rankings</h2>
<p>In 2008, the UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) confirmed the School as a world leading centre for research.
The School has been ranked one of the top three research institutions in the country in the Times Higher Education Table of Excellence, which is based on the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise.
The results indicate that in both Epidemiology and Public Health and Health Services Research the School has the largest concentration of world leading research in the UK.
In Epidemiology and Public Health, 35% of the School's research activity was assessed as 4 (world leading), with a further 35% rated as 3 (internationally excellent).
This result is particularly impressive in light of the fact that the School entered by far the highest number of staff of any UK institution (135.37),
more than double the number entered by any other institution.
In Health Services Research, 30% of its research activity received a 4* rating, and a further 35% was rated as 3.
In Infection and Immunology, 80% of research activity was rated 3 or 4.
There are no current relevant world rankings of institutions of public health (including the <a>Times Higher Education University Rankings</a>), however, LSHTM remains one of the most prestigious postgraduate institutions in public health globally.</p>
<h2>Degree Programs</h2>
<p>LSHTM offers a range of <a>taught Masters degrees</a> as well as research degrees leading to the University of London degree of DrPH, MPhil and PhD.</p>
