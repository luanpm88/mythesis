<p>  <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> (also known as <strong>Carnegie Mellon</strong> or simply <strong>CMU</strong>) is a <a>private</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Pittsburgh</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>.
The university began as the Carnegie Technical Schools, founded by <a>Andrew Carnegie</a> in 1900.
In 1912, the school became <a>Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> and began granting four-year degrees.
In 1967, the <a>Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> merged with the <a>Mellon Institute of Industrial Research</a> to form Carnegie Mellon University.
The University&#x2019;s  main campus is  from <a>Downtown Pittsburgh</a> and abuts the <a>Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh</a>, <a>Schenley Park</a>, and the campus of the <a>University of Pittsburgh</a> in the city's <a>Oakland</a> neighborhood, partially extending into <a>Squirrel Hill</a> and <a>Shadyside</a>.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon has seven colleges and independent schools: the <a>Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> (engineering), the <a>College of Fine Arts</a>, the <a>College of Humanities and Social Sciences</a>, the <a>Mellon College of Science</a>, the <a>Tepper School of Business</a>, the <a>School of Computer Science</a>, and the <a>H.
John Heinz III College</a>.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon students come from all 50 U.S. states and 93 countries and was named one of the &quot;New <a>Ivies</a>&quot; by <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</em></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Andrew Carnegie</a> &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:andrewcarnegie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Andrew Carnegie]]]] --&gt; Post-<a>Civil War</a> industrialists accumulated unprecedented wealth and were eager to found institutions in their names as part of their <a>philanthropy</a> campaigns.
<a>Washington Duke</a> at <a>Duke University</a>, <a>Leland Stanford</a> at <a>Stanford University</a>, and <a>Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> at <a>Vanderbilt University</a> are several notable examples of Carnegie's <a>gospel of wealth</a> mentality.</p>
<p>Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 in <a>Pittsburgh</a> by the <a>Scottish American</a> industrialist and philanthropist <a>Andrew Carnegie</a>, who wrote the time-honored words &quot;My heart is in the work,&quot; when he donated the funds to create the institution.
Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers.
The campus began to take shape in the <a>Beaux-Arts architecture</a> style of <a>Henry Hornbostel</a>, winner of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of what is now the <a>Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture</a>.
The name was changed to the <a>Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> in 1912, and the school began offering four-year degrees.
In 1965, it merged with the <a>Mellon Institute of Industrial Research</a> to become Carnegie Mellon University.
In addition, Carnegie founded Carnegie Mellon's coordinate <a>women's college</a>, <a>Margaret Morrison Carnegie College</a> in 1903 (the college closed in 1973).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There was little change to the campus between <a>World War I</a> and <a>II</a>.
A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented.
The period starting with the construction of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration building (1952) and ending with Wean Hall (1971) saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University.
New facilities were needed to respond to the University's growing national reputation in <a>artificial intelligence</a>, business, robotics, and the arts.
In addition, an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life, athletics, and libraries.
The campus finally expanded to <a>Forbes Avenue</a> from its original land along <a>Schenley Park</a>.
A ravine long known as &quot;the cut&quot; was gradually filled in to campus level, joining &quot;the Mall&quot; as a major campus open space.</p>
<p>[[Image:CMU Hamerschlag Hall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hamerschlag and Roberts Halls are two of the teaching facilities of the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology|College of Engineering]]]] The buildings of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style.
The <a>International Style</a>, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930s.
It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education to abandon historical styles.
By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new image.
Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of legendary University President Richard M. Cyert (1972&#x2013;1990) witnessed a period of unparalleled growth and development.
The research budget soared from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s.
The work of researchers in new fields like <a>robotics</a> and <a>software engineering</a> helped the university build on its reputation for innovation and practical problem solving.
President Cyert stressed strategic planning and comparative advantage, pursuing opportunities in areas where Carnegie Mellon could outdistance its competitors.
One example of this approach was the introduction of the university's &quot;<a>Andrew</a>&quot; computing network in the mid-1980s.
This pioneering project, which linked all <a>computer</a>s and workstations on campus, set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research.
On April 24, 1984, <a>cmu.edu</a>,
Carnegie Mellon's internet domain, became amongst the first six <a>.edu</a> <a>URL</a>s.</p>
<h3>Carnegie Mellon today</h3>

Hall, home of the world's first internet-enabled soda vending machine.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1990s and into the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among elite American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in <a>US News and World Report</a> rankings.
Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education.
Through the establishment of programs and centers that are outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as <a>computational finance</a>, <a>information systems management</a>, arts management, product design, <a>behavioral economics</a>, <a>human-computer interaction</a>, <a>entertainment technology</a>, and <a>decision science</a>.
Within the past two decades, the university has built a new University Center, theater and drama building (Purnell Center), business school building (Posner Hall), and several dormitories.
Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s, and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after.
Several computer science buildings, such as <a>Newell Simon Hall</a>, also were established, renovated, or renamed in the early 2000s.
The university has most recently completed building the Gates Hillman Complex and continues renovating historic academic and residence halls.</p>
<p>The Gates Hillman Complex, opened for occupancy on August 11, 2009, sits on a  site on the university's West Campus, surrounded by Cyert Hall, the Purnell Center for the Arts, Doherty Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, Hamburg Hall and the Collaborative Innovation Center.
It contains 318 offices as well as labs, computer clusters, lecture halls, classrooms and a 250-seat auditorium.
The Gates Hillman Complex was made possible by a $20 million lead gift from the <a>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and an additional $10 million grant from The Henry L. Hillman Foundation.
The Gates Hillman Complex and the Purnell Center for the Arts are connected by the <a>Randy Pausch</a> Memorial Footbridge.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>On April 15, 1997, <a>Jared L. Cohon</a>, former dean of <a>Yale University</a>'s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's Board of Trustees.
During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon has continued its trajectory of innovation and growth.
He leads a strategic plan that aims to leverage the University's strengths to benefit society in the areas of <a>biotechnology</a> and <a>life sciences</a>, information and security technology, <a>environmental science</a> and practices, the <a>fine arts</a> and <a>humanities</a>, and <a>business</a> and <a>public policy</a>.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2004, Carnegie Mellon launched Inspire Innovation, a $1 billion comprehensive fund raising campaign.
Half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations.
As of May 31, 2010, the campaign has brought in $640.5 million, with $263.6 million going toward Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s endowment.
It has also enabled the university to establish 17 endowed professorships, 43 endowed fellowships and 146 endowed scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Inspite

<p>Peer institutions of Carnegie Mellon's institutional research and analysis program include <a>Caltech</a>, <a>Cornell</a>, <a>Duke</a>, <a>Emory</a>, <a>Georgia Tech</a>, <a>MIT</a>, <a>Northwestern</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Rice</a>, <a>RPI</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Penn</a> and <a>Washington University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Carnegie Mellon's  main campus is three miles (5&nbsp;km) from downtown <a>Pittsburgh</a>, between <a>Schenley Park</a> and the <a>Squirrel Hill</a>, <a>Shadyside</a>, and <a>Oakland</a> neighborhoods.
Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the <a>University of Pittsburgh</a>.
Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the <a>Oakland</a> and <a>Squirrel Hill</a> neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>A large grassy area known as &quot;the Cut&quot; forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as &quot;the Mall&quot; running perpendicular.
The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building.</p>
<p>The northwestern part of the campus (home to Hamburg Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, and Gates Hillman Complex) was acquired from the <a>United States Bureau of Mines</a> in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>In 2006, Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the 80-foot-tall sculpture <a>Walking to the Sky</a>, which was placed the lawn facing Forbes Ave between the University Center and Warner Hall.
The sculpture was controversial for its placement, the general lack of input that the campus community had, and its aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Carnegie Mellon's student life includes over 225 student organizations, art galleries, and various unique traditions.
Student organizations provide social, service, media, academic, spiritual, recreational, sport, religious, political, cultural, and governance opportunities.
Carnegie Mellon's campus houses several galleries such as <em>The Frame</em>, a student-devoted gallery, and the <a>Regina Gouger Miller Gallery</a>, an art gallery that specializes in contemporary professional artists.
The <a>Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic</a>, <a>Carnegie Mellon School of Drama</a> and the student-run theatrical organization <a>Scotch'n'Soda</a> provides campus with a variety of world-class performance arts events.
The university has a strong Scottish motif inspired by Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage.
Examples include Scotty, the <a>Scottish Terrier</a> mascot, <a>The Tartan</a> student newspaper, <a>Skibo</a> Gymnasium, and The <a>Thistle</a> yearbook.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumbnail|right|The Fence</a> </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Fence</strong> - In the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge, which connected Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
The bridge was a meeting place for students.
In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area.
The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place.
The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence.
Administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party.
Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as &#x201c;the cut.&quot;
Students &#x201c;guard&#x201d; the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as this vigil is maintained, no other students may &#x201c;take&#x201d; the fence.
Once the fence is taken, however, the painting must occur between midnight and 6am.
Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Carnival</strong> - Usually held in April, Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the school year.
In addition to classic carnival attractions, the Spring Carnival features the &#x201c;Buggy Sweepstakes&#x201d; and &quot;Booth&quot; (a competition between various organizations to build small, elaborate booths based on a theme chosen each year).</li>
</ul>
<p>[[Image:CarnegieMellonBuggy.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Two
pushers exchange the buggy for [[Kappa Delta Rho]] on the first hill of Sweepstakes.]]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Buggy Races</strong> - Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around <a>Schenley Park</a>.
It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton.
Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhill.
The vehicles are unpowered, including the prohibition of such energy-storing devices as flywheels.
They are, however, steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone, arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism.
Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads.</li>
</ul>
<p><a>225px|thumb|left|A Mobot competing in the annual Mobot challenge</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobot</strong> - &quot;Mobot,' a <a>portmanteau</a> for &quot;mobile robot,&quot; is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994.
In this event, robots try (autonomously) to pass through gates, in order, and reach the finish line.
There is a white line on the pavement connecting the gates, and the line is normally used to find the gates, though it is not mandated by the rules that the robots follow the line.</li>
<li><strong>Bagpipers</strong> - As the only College offering a degree in <a>bagpipe</a> music,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie Mellon's Pipe Band features the sounds of Scottish bagpipes and performs at University events.
Head of the Pipe Band is champion piper <a>Andrew Carlisle</a>, a highly decorated solo piper and long time member of six times World Pipe Band Champions Field Marshal Montgomery.</li>
  <li><strong>The Kiltie Band</strong>- Carnegie Mellon's Kiltie Band, dressed in full Scottish regalia including kilts and knee socks, performs during every home football game.</li>
<li><strong>Autographing the Green Room</strong> - Seniors in the <a>College of Fine Arts</a> sign the Green Room's walls and ceilings before leaving the university.
Supposedly, Oscar-winning actress <a>Holly Hunter</a> broke university tradition by signing the Green Room during her freshman year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Greek tradition at Carnegie Mellon University began nearly 100 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus, <a>Theta Xi</a>, in 1912.
The Panhellenic sorority community was founded in 1945, by <a>Alpha Chi Omega</a>, <a>Delta Delta Delta</a>, <a>Delta Gamma</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, Carnegie Mellon University has ten active Fraternities: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Tau Gamma and Sigma Chi (colony).</p>
<p>In addition to participating in campus traditions such as Buggy and Booth, the fraternities and sororities hold an annual fundraiser called Greek Sing, one of the largest Greek events of the year.
Each year, the organizations vote on a cause to support and raise money through ticket sales, ad sales, corporate sponsorships and donations.
Each organization performs a 13-minute long original show or a rendition of a popular show.
In Spring 2010, Greek Sing raised over $42,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The Carnegie Mellon Tartans were a founding member of the <a>University Athletic Association</a> of the <a>NCAA Division III</a>.
Prior to World War II Carnegie Mellon (as Carnegie Tech) played with <a>NCAA Division I</a> teams and in 1939 the Tartan football team earned a trip to the NCAA National Championship at the <a>Sugar Bowl</a>.
That same year, Robert Doherty, university president at the time, banned the football team from competing in postseason bowl games.
In 1936 the Carnegie Tech riflery team won the national intercollegiate championship.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, varsity teams are fielded in basketball, track, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and cheerleading.
In addition, club teams exist in ultimate frisbee,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>rowing</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>rugby</a>, lacrosse, hockey,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  baseball,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; softball, skiing &amp; snowboarding, water polo,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; and cycling.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnegie Mellon Athletics runs a comprehensive and popular intramural system, maintains facilities (primarily Skibo Gymnasium, University Center, and Gesling Stadium), and offers courses to students in fitness and sports.
Carnegie Mellon's primary athletic rivals are fellow <a>UAA</a> schools <a>Case Western Reserve University</a> and <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>.
The Tartans have an especially intense rivalry with the <a>Washington University in St. Louis Football</a> team.</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p>On November 27, 1926, the 6-2 Carnegie Tech football team shutout <a>Knute Rockne</a>'s undefeated <a>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a> 19-0 at <a>Forbes Field</a>.
It would be the only loss for the Irish all season and only the second time they allowed a touchdown that season.
&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The game was ranked the fourth-greatest upset in <a>college football</a> history by <a>ESPN</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Bowl Game and AP rankings</h4>
<p>In the 1930s Carnegie Tech (as it was known then) was among the top football programs in the country.
In 1938 and 1939 the team achieved national rankings in the AP Poll.
Carnegie Tech earned a January 1 Bowl game date following their 1938 campaign in the <a>Sugar Bowl</a> losing 15&ndash;7 to Texas Christian.</p>
<p>Carnegie Tech's AP Ranking history includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>October 17, 1938 #13</li>
  <li>October 24, 1938 #16</li>
  <li>October 31, 1938 #19</li>
  <li>November 7, 1938 #6</li>
  <li>November 14, 1938 #6</li>
  <li>November 21, 1938 #7</li>
  <li>November 28, 1938 #6</li>
  <li>December 5, 1938 #6 FINAL</li>
  <li>October 16, 1939 #15</li>
</ul>
<h4>Modern achievements</h4>
<p>In 2006, the varsity football team was offered a bid to the NCAA Division III playoffs, and became one of the first teams in school history (the first team to win a Division III playoff game was in 1977, when Carnegie Mellon beat Dayton) and University Athletic Association (<a>UAA</a>) conference history to win an NCAA playoff game with a 21-0 shutout of <a>Millsaps College</a> of the SCAC conference.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to winning a playoff game, several team members were elected to the All American and All Region Squads.
The 2006 team won more games in a single season than any other team in school history.
The current coach is <a>Rich Lackner</a>, who is also a graduate of Carnegie Mellon and who has been the head coach since 1986.</p>
<h3>Track and cross country</h3>
<p>In recent years, the varsity <a>track</a> and <a>cross country</a> programs have seen outstanding success on the <a>Division III</a> national level.
The men's cross country team has finished in the top 15 in the nation each of the last three years, and has boasted several individual <a>All-America</a>ns.
The men's track team has also boasted several individual All-Americans spanning sprinting, distance, and field disciplines.
Recent All-Americans from the track team are Brian Harvey (2007, 2008, 2009), Davey Quinn (2007), Nik Bonaddio (2004, 2005), Mark Davis (2004, 2005), Russel Verbofsky (2004, 2005) and Kiley Williams (2005).</p>
