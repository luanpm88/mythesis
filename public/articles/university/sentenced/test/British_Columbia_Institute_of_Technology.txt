<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School was (BCVS) established in Burnaby, opening at Willingdon and Canada Way.
It was the first permanent trades school of its kind in British Columbia; its programs included carpentry, welding and aircraft maintenance.
A year later, plans were announced to establish the British Columbia Institute of Technology on adjacent land.
It was the first provincial institution dedicated to advanced technical education in BC, and its principal was named in 1962.
It offered education in the areas of engineering, business and health, enrolling 498 students in 1964.
In 1966, it celebrated its first graduates.</p>
<p>BCIT, UBC, SFU, and ECUAD jointly opened the Great Northern Way Campus in 2002.
In 2004, the number of students grew to more than 48,000, and the polytechnic status of the institution was enshrined in provincial legislation.
A year later, a Research Services Office was opened to further support applied research.</p>

<h3>Education Philosophy</h3>
<p>BCIT has a very unique education philosophy which sets it apart from typical post-secondary institutions.

Thus, the students get an exceptional amount of hands-on experience while in school.
For example, the school has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A full-equipped radio and television studio, broadcasing Evolution 107.9 FM</li>
  <li>An automated manufacturing robotics lab</li>
  <li>A Technology Centre dedicated to applied high tech research and development</li>
  <li>Western Canada's only Marine Engine Room Simulator, which provides true-to-life training for marine engineers</li>
  <li>An interactive fire simulation theatre</li>
  <li>A fully operational pulp mill</li>
  <li>The Telus Call Centre of Excellence, featuring advanced telecommunications equipment for leading-edge industry training</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to numerous other labs, these all help provide students with plenty of experience for when they begin to work in their respective industries.
Also, full-time BCIT students have a much larger course load than found at other universities and colleges; most full-time students have over 20h of school a week.</p>
<h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
<p>In 2006 BCIT became the first location in Canada for a Confucius Institute</p>
<p>In June 2010, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) has granted national accreditation to BCIT's Civil Engineering Bachelor of Engineering program.
This represents a milestone as the first accreditation of a non-university Civil Engineering program in Canada.</p>
