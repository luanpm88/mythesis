<p><strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong> (also referred to as the <strong>University of Texas</strong>, <strong>UT</strong>, <strong>UT Austin</strong>, or <strong>Texas</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Austin</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>, and is the <a>flagship</a> institution of <a>The University of Texas System</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name=&quot;flagship1&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flagship4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flagship5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main campus is located approximately  from the <a>Texas State Capitol</a>.
Founded in 1883, the university has the <a>fifth-largest</a> single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2009 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.
It currently holds the <a>largest enrollment</a> of all colleges in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The University of Texas at Austin was named one of the original eight <a>Public Ivy</a> institutions&lt;ref&gt;<em>The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities</em> (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the <a>American Association of Universities</a> in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The university is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $640 million for the 2009-2010 school year.&lt;ref
name=&quot;utexas.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Texas at Austin operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, including the <a>J.
J. Pickle Research Campus</a>.
In addition, the university was recognized by <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>The first mention of a public university in <a>Texas</a> can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the <a>Mexican</a> state of <a>Coahuila y Tejas</a>.
Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the Mexican government.
But after Texas obtained its <a>independence</a> from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the <a>Constitution of the Republic</a>, which included a provision to establish public education in the <a>republic</a>, including two universities or colleges.
On January 26, 1839, the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty <a>league</a>s of land towards the effort; in addition,  in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill.&quot;&lt;ref
name=&quot;TSHA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1846, Texas was <a>annexed</a> into the <a>United States</a>.
The state legislature passed the Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States <a>bonds</a> towards construction of a university.
In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues.
However, Texas's <a>secession</a> from the Union and the <a>American Civil War</a> prevented further action on these plans.

<p>After the war, the 1862 <a>Morrill Act</a> facilitated the creation of what is now <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas.&lt;ref
name=&quot;TSHA&quot;/&gt; The <a>Texas Constitution of 1876</a> mandated that the state establish a university &quot;at an early day,&quot; calling for the creation of a &quot;university of the first class&quot;, styled &quot;The University of Texas.&quot;
It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated  in West Texas.
In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and <a>grazing rights</a> going to The University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M.&lt;ref
name=&quot;TSHA&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department.
On the original &quot;College Hill,&quot; an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882.
The university opened its doors on September 15, 1883.</p>
<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p>[[Image:UT tower lit entirely in orange.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Main
Building (University of Texas at Austin)|The Tower]], completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons <a>different colors of lighting on special occasions.</a>]]
The old <a>Victorian</a>-<a>Gothic</a> <a>Main Building</a> served as the central point of the campus's  site, and was used for nearly all purposes.
But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty.
The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.</p>
<p>In 1910, George Brackenridge donated  located on the <a>Colorado River</a> to the university .
A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing.
Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract.
The <a>Brackenridge Field Laboratory</a> was established on  of the land in 1967.</p>
<p>As a result of the controversy, in 1921, the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land adjacent to the main campus.
But expansion was hampered by the constitutional restriction against funding the construction of buildings.
With the discovery of <a>oil</a> on university-owned grounds in 1923, the institution was able to put its new wealth towards its general endowment fund.
These savings allowed the passing of amendments to make way for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following <a>World War II</a>.
The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of <a>eminent domain</a>.
With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original .</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>On August 1, 1966, Texas student <a>Charles Whitman</a> barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building.
With two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun and various other weapons, he killed 10 people on campus from the observation deck, below the clocks on the tower and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two more inside the observation deck.
Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center, and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and that he was thinking about &quot;going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of <a>suicide</a> jumps during the 1970s.
In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public.</p>
<p>Completed in 1969, Jester Center was the largest residence hall in North America and was the largest building project in university history.
It includes two towers, which include 14-level and 10-level residences with a capacity of 3,200.</p>
<p>The first <a>presidential library</a> on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former <a>President Johnson</a>, <a>Lady Bird Johnson</a> and then-President <a>Richard Nixon</a> in attendance.
Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the <a>Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum</a> is one of 12 presidential libraries administered by the <a>National Archives and Records Administration</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Colton Pitonyak, a junior at the university, shot and killed 21-year-old Jennifer Cave in Pitonyak&#x2019;s apartment in <a>West Campus</a>.
Pitonyak was convicted and is serving a 55-year sentence for murder.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Fox7,

<p>The University of Texas has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings.
On April 30, 2006, the school opened a new  facility named the Blanton Museum of Art.
The museum, the largest university art museum in the United States, is home to more than 17,000 works from <a>Europe</a>, the <a>United States</a> and <a>Latin America</a>.&lt;ref&gt;The

In August 2008, the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center opened for conferences, seminars and continuing education and executive-education programs.
The hotel and conference center are part of a new gateway to the university extending the South Mall.
Later the same month, after three years of renovations were completed, <a>Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium</a> became the largest stadium (by seating capacity) in the state of Texas.
In addition to numerous improvements, DKR now seats 100,119, up from the previous 94,113.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, demolition of the old Experimental Sciences Building (ESB) was completed and construction began on a replacement to be named the Norman Hackerman Building (NHB) in honor and memory of Dr. Norman Hackerman, chemist, professor and president emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>On the morning of September 28, 2010, 19-year-old sophomore Colton Tooley opened fire on 21st Street between Guadalupe and Speedway with a semi-automatic copy of an <a>AK-47</a>.
He then walked into the Perry-Casta&#x00f1;eda Library, ascended the staircase to the 6th floor, and took his own life through a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The initial gunfire led to a full lockdown of the university campus within minutes.
Searches for a potential second shooter, prompted by varying descriptions of the gunman, eventually ceased and the lockdown was lifted around noon.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>[[Image:TMM austin.JPG|left|thumb|Relief sculpture in the [[Texas Memorial Museum]]]] As a state public university, the University of Texas at Austin is subject to <a>Texas House Bill 588</a>, which guarantees graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university; however, students in the top 10% are not guaranteed their choice of major, and certain colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, over 85% of enrolled students from Texas were admitted under this law.&lt;ref
name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A new state law, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature which modifies this admissions policy by limiting automatically-admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011.
The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university expects to automatically admit students in the top 8% of their graduating class for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed &quot;more selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
For Fall 2009, 31,362 applied and 45.6% were accepted, and of those accepted, 51.0% enrolled.&lt;ref
name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The university's freshman retention rate in 2009 was 92.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 81.0%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt;  The Fall 2009 entering class had an average ACT composite score of 27 and an average SAT composite score of 1830.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Student Characteristics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Faculty and research</h3>
<p> In Fall 2009, the school employed 2,770 <a>full-time</a> faculty members (88.3% of whom hold the terminal degree in their field), with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17.3 to 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt;  The university's faculty includes 63 members of the National Academy,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; winners of the <a>Nobel Prize</a>, the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>, the <a>National Medal of Science</a>, the <a>National Medal of Technology</a>, the <a>Turing Award</a> and other various awards.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Nine Nobel Laureates are or have been affiliated with UT Austin.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Except for <a>MIT</a>, UT Austin attracts more federal research grants than any American university without a medical school.&lt;ref

For the 2009-2010 school year, the university exceeded $640 million in research funding (up from $590 million the previous year)&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas.edu&quot;/&gt; and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003.&lt;ref
name=&quot;utexas1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  UT Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a <a>technology transfer</a> center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development.
In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years.
UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009.&lt;ref
name=&quot;utexas1&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy is a major research thrust of the university, with major federally-funded projects on biofuels,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; among others.
In 2009, UT founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science <a>Raymond L. Orbach</a>, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research at the university.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience, and others.
UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute in 2010 as part of an effort to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in the city of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>UT Austin operates several major auxiliary research centers.
The world's third-largest telescope, the <a>Hobby-Eberly Telescope</a>, and three other large telescopes are part of UT's <a>McDonald Observatory</a>, located  west of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The university manages nearly  of biological field laboratories, including the <a>Brackenridge Field Laboratory</a> in Austin.
The <a>J.J. Pickle Research Campus</a> (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a  cleanroom for device fabrication.
Founded in 1946, UT's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has been responsible for the development or testing of the vast majority of high-frequency sonar equipment used by the Navy, and in 2007, was granted a research contract by the Navy funded up to $928 million over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Endowment</h3>
<p> The university has an endowment of $7.2 billion, out of the $16.11 billion (according to 2008 estimates) available to the University of Texas.
This figure reflects the fact that the school has the largest endowment of any public university in the nation.</p>
<p>[[Image:View austin campus.JPG|thumb|right|View of [[Texas State Capitol]] in downtown Austin from Main Mall, south of the <a>Main Building</a>]]</p>
<p>30% of the university's endowment comes from <a>Permanent University Fund</a> (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As
required by the Texas Constitution [<a>http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html</a>], the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the <a>Available University Fund</a>, the annual distribution of PUF income.
A regental policy [<a>http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm</a>]
requires that <em>at least</em> 45 percent of this money go to the university for &quot;program enrichment.&quot;
By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the <em>minimum</em> amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies.
The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to the university.
Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service <a>bonds</a>, some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus [<a>http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf</a>].
One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share going to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF.
At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets.
This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations.
Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.</p>
<p>The university is one of only two public universities in the U.S. that have a triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies, along with the <a>University of Virginia</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>U.Va.

<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p> The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community.
The first Greek chapter on campus was the Texas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta and was founded on October 15, 1883, less than a month after the opening of the University.
Approximately 11 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or sororities.&lt;ref
name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt; With more than 50 national <a>fraternity and sorority</a> chapters, the university's Greek community is one of the largest in the nation.
These chapters are under the authority of one of the school's six Greek council communities, <a>Interfraternity Council</a>, <a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a>, Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council, United Greek Council, Multicultural Greek Council and University Panhellenic Council.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates.
They are not a part of one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization.&lt;ref
name=&quot;GreekGuide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Office of the Dean of Students' mission statement, Greek Life promotes the principles of cultural appreciation, scholarship, leadership, and <a>service</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Only the Kappa Kappa Gamma and Alpha Phi <a>fraternity and sorority houses</a> are located on campus; the majority of Greek houses are located west of the <a>Drag</a> in the neighborhood called <a>West Campus</a>.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p> Students express their opinions in and outside of class through periodicals including <em><a>Study Breaks Magazine</a></em>, <em><a>The Daily Texan</a></em> (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <em><a>Texas Travesty</a></em>.
Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through <a>K09VR</a> and <a>KVRX</a>.</p>
<p>The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the university's Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts <em>the Blogora</em>, a <a>blog</a> for &quot;connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and rhetoricians with public life&quot; by the <a>Rhetoric Society of America</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>the

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right|thumb|Texas Longhorns logo</a></p>
<p>The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs.
As of 2008, the university's athletics program ranked fifth in the nation among <a>Division I</a> schools, according to the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>National
Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in a 2002 analysis performed by <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a>.</em>&lt;ref&gt;<a>America's
Best Sports Colleges</a> <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em>. October 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Texas was also listed as the number one <a>Collegiate Licensing Company</a> client for the second consecutive year in regards to the amount of annual <a>trademark royalties</a> received from the sales of its fan merchandise.
However, this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company, which does not handle licensing for approximately three dozen large schools including <a>Ohio State</a>, <a>USC</a>, <a>UCLA</a>, <a>Michigan State</a>, and <a>Texas A&amp;M</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Varsity sports</h3>
<p>The University's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns.
A charter member of the <a>Southwest Conference</a> until its dissolution in 1996, Texas now competes in the <a>Big 12 Conference</a> (South Division) of the <a>NCAA's Division I-FBS</a>.
Texas has won 47 total national championships,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Texas Longhorns Championships History: National Champions</a> <em>TexasSports.com</em>.

name=&quot;Potomac&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarheel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BC$&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Ark State gw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The team experienced its greatest success under coach <a>Darrell Royal</a>, winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970.
It won a fourth title under head coach <a>Mack Brown</a> in 2005 after a 41-38 victory over previously undefeated <a>Southern California</a> in the <a>2006 Rose Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, the men's <a>basketball</a> team has gained prominence, advancing to the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the <a>Elite Eight</a> in 2006 and 2008.</p>
<p>The University's <a>baseball</a> team is considered to be one of the best in the nation with more trips to the <a>College World Series</a> (33) than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002 and 2005.</p>

<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p>The Longhorns have a rivalry in all sports with the <a>Texas A&amp;M Aggies</a>.
The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the <a>State Farm Lone Star Showdown</a> series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team.
The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools.
The Longhorns lead the &quot;showdown,&quot; 75-36-5.
The game is traditionally played on <a>Thanksgiving</a> day.
Both schools hold a rally before the annual football game &mdash; Texas hosts the <a>Hex Rally</a>, and students at Texas A&amp;M host the <a>Aggie Bonfire</a> (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&amp;M event after the deaths of 12 students in 1999).</p>
<p>The Longhorns also have a long standing football rivalry with the <a>Oklahoma Sooners</a> and hold a 59-41-5 edge in that series.
Since 1932, the teams have played annually at the <a>Cotton Bowl</a> in Dallas, Texas, in the <a>Red River Rivalry</a> game.
The rivalry has grown in recent years, as the winner has gone to the Big 12 Conference championship and BCS National championship games.</p>
<p>Other schools, such as <a>University of Arkansas</a> and <a>Texas Tech</a>, also count Texas among their rivals; however, each of these schools also trail Texas by significant margins in overall series records, 56-21-0 and 45-15-0, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Texas
