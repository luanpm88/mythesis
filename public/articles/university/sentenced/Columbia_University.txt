<h2>History</h2>
<p>Columbia is the oldest institution of higher education in the state of <a>New York</a>.
Founded and chartered as King's College in 1754, Columbia is the sixth-oldest such institution in the United States (by date of founding; fifth by date of chartering).
After the <a>American Revolutionary War</a> King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784.
The university now operates under a 1787 charter that places the institution under a private <a>board of trustees</a>, and in 1896 it was further renamed Columbia University.
Columbia has grown over time to encompass twenty schools and affiliated institutions.</p>
<h3>King's College: 1754&#x2013;1784</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|Trinity Church schoolyard, the first home of King's College c.1755, as imagined in a 1954 illustration created for Columbia's bicentennial.
(Columbia University Archives)</a> Discussions regarding the foundation of a college in the <a>Province of New York</a> began as early as 1704, but serious consideration of such proposals was not entertained until the early 1750s, when local graduates of <a>Yale</a> and members of the congregation of <a>Trinity Church</a> (then <a>Church of England</a>, now <a>Episcopal</a>) in New York City became alarmed by the establishment of the College of New Jersey (now <a>Princeton University</a>).
Concerns arose both because it was founded by &quot;new-light&quot; <a>Presbyterians</a> influenced by the evangelical <a>Great Awakening</a> and, as it was located in the province just across the <a>Hudson River</a>, because it provoked fears of New York developing a cultural and intellectual inferiority.
They established their own 'rival' institution, King's College, and elected as its first president <a>Samuel Johnson</a>.
Classes began on July&nbsp;17, 1754 in Trinity Church yard, with Johnson as the sole faculty member.
A few months later, on October&nbsp;31, 1754, Great Britain's <a>King George II</a> officially granted a royal charter for the college.
In 1760, King's College moved to its own building at Park Place, near the present <a>City Hall</a>, and in 1767 it established the first American <a>medical school</a> to grant the <a>M.D.</a> degree.</p>
<p>[[File:Johnson2.JPG|thumb|right|The Rev. Dr. [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Samuel Johnson]], first president of King's College]]</p>
<p>Controversy surrounded the founding of the new college in New York, as it was a thoroughly Church of England institution dominated by the influence of <a>Crown officials</a> in its governing body, such as the <a>Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and the <a>Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>.
Fears of the establishment of a Church of England <a>episcopacy</a> and of <a>Crown</a> influence in America through King's College were underpinned by its vast wealth, far surpassing all other <a>colonial colleges</a> of the period.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|King's College Hall, 1770</a> The <a>American Revolution</a> and the subsequent <a>war</a> were catastrophic for the operation of King's College.
It suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the <a>Continental Army</a> in the spring of that year.
The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their <a>departure</a> in 1783.
The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter,

<p>Although the college had been considered a bastion of <a>Tory</a> sentiment, it nevertheless produced many key <a>leaders of the Revolutionary generation</a> &#x2014; individuals later instrumental in the college's revival.
Among the earliest students and trustees of King's College were five <a>&quot;founding fathers&quot; of the United States</a>: <a>John Jay</a>, who negotiated the <a>Treaty of Paris</a> between the United States and Great Britain, ending the Revolutionary War, and who later became the first <a>Chief Justice of the United States</a>; <a>Alexander Hamilton</a>, military aide to General <a>George Washington</a>, author of most of the <em><a>Federalist Papers</a></em>, and the first <a>Secretary of the Treasury</a>; <a>Gouverneur Morris</a>, the author of the final draft of the <a>United States Constitution</a>; <a>Robert R. Livingston</a>, a member of the <a>Committee of Five</a>,   that drafted the <a>Declaration of Independence</a>, and <a>Egbert Benson</a> who represented New York in the <a>Continental Congress</a> and the <a>Annapolis Convention</a> and who was a ratifier of the United States Constitution.</p>

the most famous King's College alumnus, [[Alexander Hamilton]] (shown here as a young man)]] Hamilton's first experience with the military came while a student during the summer of 1775, after <a>the outbreak of fighting at Boston</a>.
Along with <a>Nicholas Fish</a>, <a>Robert Troup</a>, and a group of other students from King's he joined a volunteer militia company called the &quot;<a>Hearts of Oak</a>&quot; &#x2013; Hamilton achieving the rank of Lieutenant.
They adopted distinctive uniforms, complete with the words &quot;Liberty or Death&quot; on their hatbands, and drilled under the watchful eye of a former British officer in the graveyard of the nearby <a>St.
Paul's Chapel</a>.
In August 1775, while under fire from , the Hearts of Oak (a.k.a. the &quot;Corsicans&quot;) participated in a successful raid to seize cannon from <a>the Battery</a>, becoming an artillery unit thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow,

<h3>Early Columbia College: 1784&#x2013;1857</h3>
<p>[[File:Dewitt.jpg|thumb|right|[[DeWitt
Clinton]], one of the first students enrolled in &quot;Columbia College&quot;]] After the war, the remaining members of the Board of Governors of King's sought to resuscitate the college, petitioning the Legislature of New York to &quot;make such alterations in the Charter as the changed condition of affairs might demand.&quot;
The Legislature agreed, and on May&nbsp;1, 1784, it passed &quot;an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College.&quot;&lt;ref
name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created a <a>Board of Regents</a> to oversee the resuscitation of King's, giving them the power to hire a college president and appoint professors, but prohibiting the College from administering any &quot;religious <a>test-oath</a>&quot; to its faculty.
Finally, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that &quot;the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of <a>Columbia College</a>.&quot;&lt;ref
name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>On May 5, 1784, the Regents held their first meeting, instructing Treasurer <a>Brockholst Livingston</a> and Secretary <a>Robert Harpur</a> (who was Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at King's) to recover the books, records and any other assets that had been dispersed during the war, and appointing a committee to supervise the repairs of the college building.
In addition, the Regents moved quickly to rebuild Columbia's faculty, appointing William Cochran instructor of Greek and Latin.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>In the summer of 1784, after the legislature passed the act restoring the college, Major General <a>James Clinton</a>, a hero of the revolutionary war, brought his son <a>DeWitt Clinton</a> to New York on his way to enroll him as a student at the College of New Jersey.
When <a>James Duane</a>, the Mayor of New York and a member of the Regents, heard that the younger Clinton was leaving the state for his education, he pleaded with Cochran to offer him admission to the reconstituted Columbia.
Cochran agreed &#x2014; in no small part due to the fact that DeWitt's uncle, <a>George Clinton</a>, the Governor of New York, had recently been elected Chancellor of the College by the Regents &#x2014; and DeWitt Clinton became one of nine students admitted to Columbia that year.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>As the state proved negligent in its funding of the institution, this arrangement became increasingly unsatisfactory for both.
An expansion of the Regents to 20 New York City residents had placed Hamilton and Jay at the helm, and they, along with Duane, argued for <a>privatization</a> of the college.
In 1787 a new charter was adopted for the college, still in use today, granting power to a private board of Trustees.
Samuel Johnson's son, <a>William Samuel Johnson</a>, became its president.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|College Hall in 1790</a>For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive <a>Federalist</a> governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay.
<a>George Washington</a>, notably, attended the commencement of 1790, and nascent interest in legal education commenced under Professor <a>James Kent</a>.
As the state and country transitioned to a considerably more <a>Jeffersonian</a> era, however, the college's good fortunes began to dry up.
The primary difficulty was funding; the college, already receiving less from the state following its privatization, was beset with even more financial difficulties as hostile politicians took power and as new upstate colleges, particularly <a>Hamilton</a> and <a>Union</a>, lobbied effectively for subsidies.
What Columbia did receive was Manhattan real estate, which would only later prove lucrative.</p>
<p>Columbia's performance flagged for the remainder of the 19th century's first half.
The law faculty never managed to thrive during this period, and in 1807 the medical school, hoping to arrest its decline, broke off to merge with the independent College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Contention between students and faculty were highlighted by the &quot;Riotous Commencement&quot; of 1811, in which students violently protested the faculty's decision not to confer a degree upon John Stevenson, who had inserted objectionable words into his commencement speech.
Though the college was finally able to shake its embarrassing reputation for structural shabbiness by adding several wings to College Hall and refinishing it in the more fashionable <a>Greek Revival</a> style, the effort failed to halt Columbia's long-term downturn, and was soon overshadowed by the Gibbs Affair of 1854, in which famed chemistry professor <a>Oliver Wolcott Gibbs</a> was denied a professorship at the college, from which he had graduated, due to his <a>Unitarian</a> affiliation.
The event demonstrated to many, including frustrated diarist and trustee <a>George Templeton Strong</a>, the narrow-mindedness of the institution.
By July, 1854 the <em>Christian Examiner</em> of Boston, in an article entitled &quot;The Recent Difficulties at Columbia College&quot;, noted that the school was &quot;good in classics&quot; yet &quot;weak in sciences&quot;, and had &quot;very few distinguished graduates&quot;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;appendixe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Expansion and the move to Madison Avenue</h3>
<p>[[File:columbia law madison.gif|left|thumb|The
[[Gothic Revival]] Law School building on the Madison Avenue campus]] In 1857, the College moved from Park Place to a primarily <a>Gothic Revival</a> campus on 49th&nbsp;Street and <a>Madison Avenue</a>, where it remained for the next fifty years.
The transition to the new campus coincided with a new outlook for the college; during the commencement of that year, College President <a>Charles King</a> proclaimed Columbia &quot;a university&quot;.
During the last half of the nineteenth century, under the leadership of President <a>F.A.P. Barnard</a>, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a true modern university.
<a>Columbia Law School</a> was founded in 1858, and in 1864 the <a>School of Mines</a>, the country's first such institution and the precursor to today's <a>Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, was established.
<a>Barnard College</a> for women, established by the eponymous Columbia president, was established in 1889; the <a>Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> came under the aegis of the university in 1891, followed by <a>Teachers College, Columbia University</a> in 1893.
The Graduate Faculties in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science awarded its first PhD in 1875.&lt;ref
name=appendixe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This period also witnessed the inauguration of Columbia's participation in intercollegiate sports, with the creation of the baseball team in 1867, the organization of the football team in 1870, and the creation of a <a>crew</a> team by 1873.
The first intercollegiate Columbia football game was a 6&#x2013;3 loss to <a>Rutgers</a>.
The <em><a>Columbia Daily Spectator</a></em> began publication during this period as well, in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Columbia

<h3>Morningside Heights</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Development of the Morningside Heights campus by 1915</a> In 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as &quot;Columbia University in the City of New York.&quot;
Additionally, the engineering school was renamed the &quot;School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry.&quot;
At the same time, university president <a>Seth Low</a> moved the campus again, from 49th&nbsp;Street to its present location, a more spacious (and, at the time, more rural) campus in the developing neighborhood of <a>Morningside Heights</a>.
The site was formerly occupied by the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum.
One of the asylum's buildings, the warden's cottage (later known as East Hall and Buell Hall), still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Columbia

Constructed in 1895, the building is still referred to as &quot;Low Library&quot; although it has not functioned as a library since 1934.
It currently houses the offices of the President and Provost, the Visitor's Center, the Trustees' Room and Columbia Security.
Patterned loosely on the Classical <a>Pantheon</a>, it is surmounted by the largest all-granite dome in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>[[File:Low Library2.jpg|thumb|left|Rotunda of [[Low Memorial Library]], Columbia University, circa 1900&#x2013;1910.
The building was later converted to administrative use and the rotunda became a ceremonial space.]]</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Low's successor, <a>Nicholas Murray Butler</a>, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the &quot;multiversity&quot; model that later universities would adopt.
On the Morningside Heights campus, Columbia centralized on a single campus the College, the School of Law, the Graduate Faculties, the School of Mines (predecessor of the Engineering School), and the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons.
Butler went on to serve as president of Columbia for over four decades and became a giant in American public life (as one-time vice presidential candidate and a <a>Nobel Laureate</a>).
His introduction of &quot;downtown&quot; business practices in university administration led to innovations in internal reforms such as the centralization of academic affairs, the direct appointment of registrars, deans, provosts, and secretaries, as well as the formation of a professionalized university bureaucracy, unprecedented among American universities at the time.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right| One of the earliest logos of Columbia University Press</a></p>
<p>In 1893 the <a>Columbia University Press</a> was founded to &quot;promote the study of economic, historical, literary, scientific and other subjects; and to promote and encourage the publication of literary works embodying original research in such subjects.&quot;
Among its publications are <em><a>The Columbia Encyclopedia</a></em>, first published in 1935, and <em>The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World</em>, first published in 1952.</p>
<p>In 1902, New York newspaper magnate <a>Joseph Pulitzer</a> donated a substantial sum to the university for the founding of a school to teach journalism.
The result was the 1912 opening of the <a>Graduate School of Journalism</a>&mdash;the only journalism school in the Ivy League.
Columbia does not, however, offer an undergraduate degree in journalism.
In New York City, there are only two universities that offer such degrees:<a>St.
John's University (New York)</a> and <a>New York University</a>.
The school is the administrator of the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> and the <a>duPont-Columbia Award</a> in broadcast journalism.</p>
<p>In 1904 Columbia organized adult education classes into a formal program called Extension Teaching (later renamed University Extension).
Courses in Extension Teaching eventually give rise to the Columbia Writing Program, the <a>Columbia Business School</a>, and the School of Dentistry and Oral Surgery.</p>
<p>[[File:Uris Hall at Columbia University IMG 0945.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Uris Hall houses the [[Columbia Business School]].]]</p>
<p><a>Columbia Business School</a> was added in the early 20th century.
During the first half of the 20th Century Columbia and <a>Harvard University</a> had the largest endowments in the United States.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Archetypal Columbia man, from a 1902 poster</a></p>
<p>By the late 1930s, a Columbia student could study with the likes of <a>Jacques Barzun</a>, <a>Paul Lazarsfeld</a>, <a>Mark Van Doren</a>, <a>Lionel Trilling</a>, and <a>I.
I. Rabi</a>.
The university's graduates during this time were equally accomplished&mdash;for example, two alumni of Columbia's Law School, <a>Charles Evans Hughes</a> and <a>Harlan Fiske Stone</a> (who also held the position of Law School dean), served successively as Chief Justices of the United States.
<a>Dwight Eisenhower</a> served as Columbia's president from 1948 until he became the <a>President of the United States</a> in 1953.</p>

<p>Research into the atom by faculty members <a>John R. Dunning</a>, I. I. Rabi, <a>Enrico Fermi</a> and <a>Polykarp Kusch</a> placed Columbia's Physics Department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the <a>Manhattan Project</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Broad&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Following the end of World War II, the School of International Affairs was founded in 1946.
Focusing on developing <a>diplomat</a>s and <a>foreign affairs</a> specialists, the school began by offering the <a>Master of International Affairs</a>.
To satisfy an increasing desire for skilled <a>public service</a> professionals at home and abroad, the School added the <a>Master of Public Administration</a> degree in 1977.
In 1981, the School was renamed the <a>School of International and Public Affairs</a> (SIPA).
The School introduced an MPA in <a>Environmental Science</a> and <a>Policy</a> in 2001 and, in 2004, SIPA inaugurated its first doctoral program &#x2014; the interdisciplinary Ph.D. in <a>Sustainable Development</a>.</p>
<p>In 1947, to meet the needs of <a>GIs</a> returning from World War II, University Extension was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the <a>Columbia University School of General Studies</a>.
While the former university extension had granted the B.S.&nbsp;degree since 1921, the School of General Studies first granted the B.A.&nbsp;degree in 1968 and is now considered one of the three colleges of Columbia University (CC, SEAS, GS).
<a>thumb|left|Earl Hall houses the chaplain's office and numerous religious and service student organizations.</a></p>
<p>During the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism centering over the Vietnam War and the demand for greater <a>student rights</a>.
Many students, led by the <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a> and its President <a>Mark Rudd</a> protested the university's ties with the defense establishment and its controversial plans to build a gym in <a>Morningside Park</a>.
The fervor on campus reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus.
The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's then President, <a>Grayson Kirk</a> and the establishment of the University Senate.</p>
<p><a>thumb|<em>Pro Ecclesia Dei</em>, St. Paul's Chapel of Columbia University offers sanctuary for spiritual solace on campus.</a>
Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with <a>Barnard College</a>, an all female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.
Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College.&lt;ref
name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;<a>Link text.</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1990 the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences was created, unifying the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the School of International and Public Affairs.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Columbia Engineering School was renamed the <a>Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, in honor of Chinese businessman <a>Z.
Y. Fu</a>, who gave Columbia $26&nbsp;million.
The school is popularly referred to as &quot;SEAS&quot; or simply &quot;the engineering school.&quot;</p>
<h3>Manhattanville campus expansion</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Construction site</a> As of April 2007, the university had purchased more than two-thirds of the  sought for a new campus in <a>Manhattanville</a>, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus.
Stretching from <a>125th Street</a> to 133rd&nbsp;Street, the new campus would house buildings for Columbia's schools of business and the arts and allow the construction of the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The $7&nbsp;billion expansion plan includes demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant, eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132&nbsp;apartments.
Replacing these buildings will be  of space for the University.
The space will be used for additional teaching, critical research, and auxiliary services.
Designed by Pritzker prize winning architect <a>Renzo Piano</a>, the  will include more accessible pedestrian streets and additional public open spaces.</p>
<p>According to the 2006 Environmental Impact Statement certified by the Department of City Planning, almost 300 people would be displaced from the project zone, and almost 3,300 would be displaced from areas surrounding it.
Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition.
Most recently, as of December 2008, the State of New York's <a>Empire State Development Corporation</a> approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's &quot;blighted&quot; status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On May&nbsp;20, 2009, the New York Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate admissions and financial aid</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Van Am Quad</a> [[File:Hamiltonhall1.JPEG|thumb|left|[[Hamilton Hall]], home of the Columbia undergraduate admissions office]] Columbia University's acceptance rate for the class of 2014 is 9.16%,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; making Columbia the fifth most selective college in the United States by admission rate behind <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, and <a>Yale</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The undergraduate yield rate exceeds 60%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the 2011 college selectivity ranking by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria, Columbia is the third most selective college in the nation, behind <a>Yale</a> and <a>Caltech</a> and tied with <a>Harvard</a>, <a>MIT</a>, and <a>Princeton</a>.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report, Americas Best Rankings 2011, National University Rankings, Selectivity Ranking (the former is available only in the print edition and--for purchase--in the online premium edition)&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color.
Additionally, 50.3% of all undergraduates in the Class of 2013 receive financial aid.
The average financial aid package for these students exceeds $30,000, with an average grant size of over $20,000.&lt;ref
name=&quot;stat&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus <a>John Kluge</a>&lt;ref&gt;<a>Wall Street Journal article breaking the news about Kluge's donation</a>&lt;/ref&gt; to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid.
The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.
Its exact value will depend on the eventual value of Kluge's estate at the time of his death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia.
The University is able to extend financial aid offerings to more students; Columbia now has one of the most comprehensive <a>financial aid policies</a> among the nation's colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in <a>Columbia College</a> and the <a>School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> with family income under $60,000 are not expected to pay tuition, room, board, and other fees.
At the same time, all students who are eligible for financial aid (regardless of income), in lieu of loans, will be awarded University grants.
However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students or students from the School of General Studies.</p>
<p>Starting in 2010, admissions to Columbia's undergraduate colleges <a>Columbia College</a> and the <a>School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> will accept the <a>Common Application</a>.
The policy change will make Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last <a>Ivy League</a> university to switch to the common application.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Switch
to Common App</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Morningside Heights</h3>
<p>[[File:116th Street Columbia University IRT 006.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Access to Columbia University is enhanced by direct [[New York City Subway|subway]] service via the <a>IRT</a> <a>1</a> to <a>116th Street - Columbia University</a> Station.
The chief Engineer of the NYC subway, <a>William Barclay Parsons</a> was a Columbia graduate.
Naturally, he designed a stop just outside Columbia's main campus gates.]]</p>
<p>The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in <a>Morningside Heights</a> on <a>Seth Low</a>'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught in one location.
The campus was designed along <a>Beaux-Arts</a> principles by acclaimed architects <a>McKim, Mead, and White</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:Butler Library - 1000px - AC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|thumb|[[Butler Library]] is named for former Columbia President <a>Nicholas Murray Butler</a>.]]</p>
<p>Columbia's main <a>campus</a> occupies more than six <a>city block</a>s, or , in <a>Morningside Heights</a>, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions.
The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff.
Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Columbia
University Office of Undergraduate Admissions - Housing &amp; Dining&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University has an extensive <a>underground tunnel system</a> more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus.
Some of these remain open to students, while others are closed to the public.</p>
<p>[[File:Low Memorial Library Columbia University NYC.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Low Memorial Library]]]]</p>
<p>New buildings and <a>structures</a> on the campus, especially those built after <a>Second World War</a>, have often only been constructed after a contentious process often involving open debate and community protest.
Often the complaints raised during periods of expansion have included issues beyond the debate over construction of designs that diverged from the original McKim, Mead, and White plan.
Protests often involved complaints against the university administration.
This was the case with Uris Hall, built in the 1960s and more recently with <a>Alfred Lerner Hall</a>, a <a>deconstructivist</a> structure completed in 1998 and designed by Columbia's then-Dean of Architecture, <a>Bernard Tschumi</a>, and the Northwest Corner Building, which was completed in 2010 and was designed by <a>Pritzker Prize</a>-winning architect <a>Rafael Moneo</a>.
These same issues have surfaced in the debate over future expansion into <a>Manhattanville</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:Columbia College Walk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&quot;College
Walk&quot; provides a public path between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, passing through the main [[campus]] quad.]]</p>
<p>Columbia's <a>library system</a> includes over 10.4 million volumes, making it the fifth largest collegiate and eighth largest library system in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Sources
vary; e.g.
: &quot;10,449,223 printed volumes&quot;; : 9,277,042 &quot;volumes held.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Several buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
<a>Low Memorial Library</a>, a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance.
<a>Philosophy Hall</a> is listed as the site of the invention of <a>FM radio</a>.
Also listed is <a>Pupin Hall</a>, another <a>National Historic Landmark</a>, which houses the physics and astronomy departments.
Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by <a>Enrico Fermi</a>.
The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in <a>Copenhagen, Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>The name <em><a>Alma Mater</a></em> refers to a statue on the steps (see right) of <a>Low Memorial Library</a> by sculptor <a>Daniel Chester French</a>.
There is a small owl &quot;hidden&quot; on the sculpture.
Alma Mater is also the subject of many Columbia legends.
The main legends include that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Barnard student who finds it will marry a Columbia man, given that Barnard is a <a>women's college</a>.
Another legend exists that back-up Alma Maters are kept at the ready should need arise after one alum supposedly heard Alma Mater blow up in the 1970s.
During prospective student tours, Columbia tour guides tell students to rub Alma Mater's foot, for this ensures admittance to the university.</p>
<p>&quot;The Steps&quot;, alternatively known as &quot;Low Steps&quot; or the &quot;Urban Beach&quot;, are a popular meeting area for Columbia students.
The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace.
On warm days, the steps become crowded with students conversing, reading, or sunbathing.
Occasionally, they play host to film screenings and concerts.
The King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe annually performs an outdoor play on the steps.
The design of the steps is modeled after the architecture in Raphael's &quot;<a>The School of Athens</a>&quot;, a fresco in the <a>Vatican</a>.

<h3>University Hospital</h3>
<p><a>New York-Presbyterian Hospital</a> is affiliated with medical schools of both Columbia University and <a>Cornell University</a>.
According to the <em>US News and World Report</em>s &quot;Americas Best Hospitals 2009&quot;, it is ranked sixth overall and third among university hospitals.
Columbia Medical School has a strategic partnership with <a>New York State Psychiatric Institute</a>, and is affiliated with nineteen other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals overseas.</p>
<h3>Other campuses</h3>
<p>Health-related schools are located at the <a>Columbia University Medical Center</a>,  located in the neighborhood of <a>Washington Heights</a>, fifty blocks uptown.
Columbia also owns the  Baker Field, which includes the <a>Lawrence A. Wien Stadium</a> as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track and tennis, at the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of <a>Inwood</a>).
There is a third campus on the west bank of the <a>Hudson River</a>, the  <a>Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a> in <a>Palisades, New York</a>.
A fourth is the  <a>Nevis Laboratories</a> in <a>Irvington, New York</a>.
A satellite site in Paris holds classes at <a>Reid Hall</a>.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>On-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate.
<a>Columbia College</a> and <a>SEAS</a> share housing in the on-campus residence halls.
First-year students in usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: <a>Hartley Hall</a>, <a>Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall)</a>, <a>John Jay Hall</a>, Furnald Hall or <a>Carman Hall</a>.
Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends.</p>
<p>The <a>Columbia University School of General Studies</a> and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Campus Organizations</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students from any of the school's three undergraduate colleges and <a>Barnard College</a> are allowed to join any of the over four-hundred student groups on campus recognized by the school's <a>student government</a>.</p>

At halftime, alumni stand and sing the alma mater, &quot;Sans Souci.&quot;
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a> and athletic games is: Colossus of Columbia, the Columbia University <a>fight song</a>.

<p>Columbia became the third school in the United States to play intercollegiate football when it sent a squad to New Brunswick, N.J., in 1870 to play a team from <a>Rutgers</a>.
Three years later, Columbia students joined representatives from <a>Princeton</a>, Rutgers and <a>Yale</a> to ratify the first set of rules to govern intercollegiate play.</p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, the Lions had consistent success on the gridiron.
Under Hall of Fame coach <a>Lou Little</a>, the 1934 squad shut out heavily favored <a>Stanford</a> in the <a>Rose Bowl</a> winning what was the precursor to the national championship.
During World War II football players were recruited to move uranium in support of the school's participation in the <a>Manhattan Project</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Broad&quot;/&gt; Little's 1947 edition beat defending national champion <a>Army</a>, then riding a 32-game win streak, in one of the most stunning upsets of the century.
Greats of the era included the <a>All-American</a> <a>Sid Luckman</a>, the quarterback who would lead the <a>Chicago Bears</a> to four NFL championships in the 1940s while ushering football into the modern era with the <a>T formation</a>.</p>
<p>Since sharing their only Ivy League title with <a>Harvard</a> in 1961, the football Lions have had only three winning seasons (6&#x2013;3 in 1971, 5&#x2013;4&#x2013;1 in 1994 and 8&#x2013;2 in 1996).
<a>Norries Wilson</a>, a runner-up for national assistant coach of the year while at the <a>University of Connecticut</a> in 2004, is the latest head coach brought in to try to turn the program around.
Several Lions players have gone on to success in the <a>National Football league</a> in the past few decades, including quarterback <a>John Witkowski</a>, offensive lineman <a>George Starke</a>, and linebacker <a>Marcellus Wiley</a>.</p>
<p>The Lions boast a rich athletic tradition.
The <a>wrestling</a> team is the oldest in the nation, and the <a>football</a> team was the third to join intercollegiate play.
A Columbia <a>crew</a> was the first from outside Britain to win at the <a>Henley Royal Regatta</a>.
Former students include <a>baseball Hall of Famers</a> <a>Lou Gehrig</a> and <a>Eddie Collins</a>, <a>football Hall of Famer</a> <a>Sid Luckman</a> and world champion women's weightlifter <a>Karyn Marshall</a>.&lt;ref
name=tws02oct01&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>More recently, Columbia has excelled at <a>archery</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>fencing</a> and <a>wrestling</a>.
In 2000, <a>Olympic</a> <a>gold medal</a> <a>swimmer</a> <a>Cristina Teuscher</a> became the first Ivy League student to win the <a>Honda-Broderick Cup</a>, awarded to the best collegiate woman athlete in the nation.
In 2005, Caroline Bierbaum, Women's Cross Country/Track and Field, won the Honda award for Cross Country following a third-place finish at the NCAA meet and five All-American selections in Cross Country, Indoor and Outdoor Track.
In 2007, the Men's Track Team became the first Ivy League school to win a Championship of America race at the prestigious Penn Relays since 1974 by capturing the 4x800.
The team of Michael Mark, Jonah Rathbun, Erison Hurtalt and Liam Boylan-Pett ran 7:22.64, with Boylan-Pett outkicking the anchor legs of national powerhouses Michigan, Villanova, and Oral Roberts.
The team has finished no lower than fifth in the past three years.
That year, Erison Hurtault '07 completed a career sweep of the Indoor and Outdoor Ivy League 400m, winning all eight races he competed in.
In addition to being a nine-time Ivy League champion and All-American, Erison represented Dominica at both the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2009 Berlin World Championships.
Women's Track and Field graduate and current coach Delilah DiCrescenzo has been ranked as high as 5th in the nation in the 3000m steeplechase.
In March 2010, Kyle Merber became the first Columbia athlete to break four minutes in the mile, running 3:58.52 at the Columbia Last Chance Meet at the 168th St. Armory.
The mark is also an Ivy League indoor record.</p>
<p>In 2008, <a>Olympic</a> <a>silver medal</a> <a>fencer</a> James L. Williams along with three teammates, including <a>Keeth Smart</a>, Class of 2010 at <a>Columbia Business School</a>, earned the first American medals in men's fencing since 1984, bringing Columbia's total number of Olympic medalists to 10.</p>

<p>The <a>Columbia University Marching Band</a>, America's first college marching band to convert to the &quot;<a>scramble band</a>&quot; format, is perhaps Columbia's most notorious student group, due to both its penchant for edgy humor and its central role in campus traditions such as Orgo Night.
For this reason, the Band is frequently seen on campus performing as more of a humor or comedy group rather than or in addition to its role as a spirit group, although it does also cheer and play songs at Columbia football and basketball games, just as a traditional marching band would.</p>
<p>There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.</p>

In the 2005&#x2013;06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for &quot;students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of <a>Alexander Hamilton</a>&quot;.
(Hamilton was an alum who served with <a>George Washington</a> during the <a>American Revolution</a>.)</p>
<p>The University also houses an independent nonprofit organization, Community Impact.
Community Impact strives to serve disadvantaged people in the Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights communities.
Community Impact strives to provide high quality programs, advance the public good, and foster meaningful volunteer opportunities for students, faculty, and staff of Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the university's student body and staff keep the program in operation through volunteerism, as well as off campus volunteers.</p>
<h2>Controversies and student demonstrations</h2>
<p>[[File:Tony-kushner.1978-graduation.jpg|thumb|right|
Playwright [[Tony Kushner]] protesting at his 1978 graduation]]</p>
<h4>Protests of 1968</h4>
<p> Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues.
The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring <a>Morningside Park</a>; this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring <a>Harlem</a>.
A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in <a>the Pentagon</a>'s weapons research think-tank, the <a>Institute for Defense Analyses</a> (IDA).
Students barricaded themselves inside <a>Low Library</a>, <a>Hamilton Hall</a>, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Columbia's
Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion&quot;, New York Times, April 28, 2008</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Columbia University - 1968</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Protests against racism and apartheid</h4>
<p>Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of <a>Hamilton Hall</a> and the Business School&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Disinvestment from South Africa #University campuses&quot;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the <a>apartheid</a> regime in South Africa.
A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of University investments in South Africa.
The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. University.</p>
<p>The initial (and partial) Columbia divestment,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; focused largely on bonds and financial institutions directly involved with the South African regime.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It followed a year long campaign first initiated by students who had worked together to block the appointment of former <a>United States Secretary of State</a> <a>Henry Kissinger</a> to an endowed chair at the University in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Broadly backed by a diverse array of student groups and many notable faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held numerous teach-ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa.
Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
These initial successes set a pattern which was later repeated at many more campuses across the country, resulting in the eventual divestment at hundreds of colleges and universities.</p>
<h4>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visit and speech controversy</h4>
<p>  The <a>School of International and Public Affairs</a> traditionally extends invitations to many heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly.
In 2007, <a>Iran</a>ian President <a>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> was one of those invited to speak on campus.
Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September&nbsp;24, 2007 as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The invitation proved to be highly controversial.
Thousands of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September&nbsp;24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide.
University President <a>Lee Bollinger</a> tried to triangulate the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger).
This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized <a>Israel</a>'s existence and policies towards the <a>Palestinians</a>; called for research on the historical accuracy of <a>Holocaust</a>; raised questions as to who initiated the <a>9/11 attacks</a>; defended Iran's <a>nuclear power program</a>, criticizing the <a>United Nations</a>' policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked <a>U.S. foreign policy</a> in the Middle East.
In response to a question about Iran's <a>treatment</a> of <a>women</a> and <a>homosexuals</a>, he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that &quot;In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country...
In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon.
I don't know who's told you that we have it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/hourlyupdate/202820.php</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter statement drew <a>laughter</a> from the audience.</p>

In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue.
ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.
In April 2010 during <a>Admiral</a> <a>Mike Mullen</a>'s address at Columbia, president <a>Lee Bollinger</a> stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the <a>don't ask, don't tell</a> policy were successful.</p>
<h4>Warning Against Wikileaks Tweets and Links</h4>
<p>After a student uproar, Columbia University reversed&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;<a>Columbia University Reverses Anti-WikiLeaks Guidance | Threat Level | Wired.com&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; its guidance regarding Wikileaks tweets and links.Columbia University&#x2019;s School of International and Public Affairs Dean, John H. Coatsworth, on December 6, 2010, sent an email to the SIPA community stating; &quot;Freedom of information and expression is a core value of our institution....Thus, SIPA&#x2019;s position is that students have a right to discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens, and to do so without fear of adverse consequences.&quot;&lt;ref
name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The week before, Columbia University students had been warned by their Office of Career Services that the U.S. State Department had contacted the office saying that the diplomatic cables which were released by WikiLeaks were &quot;still considered classified.&quot;
and that &quot;online discourse about the documents 'would call into question your ability to deal with confidential information.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Gary Sick, who served on the National Security Council under three Presidents, vehemently repudiated the warning memo.
&quot;If anyone is a master&#x2019;s student in international relations and they haven&#x2019;t heard of WikiLeaks and gone looking for the documents that relate to their area of study, then they don&#x2019;t deserve to be a graduate student in international relations,&quot; Sick told Wired.com in an interview.
Professor Sick also wrote an article titled; &quot;Am I a Criminal?&quot; in which he said; &quot;Note to the US government: We know this is bad for you.
Don&#x2019;t make it worse by criminalizing everyone who studies international politics.&quot;&lt;ref

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p></p>
<h4>Orgo Night</h4>
<p>On the day before the Organic Chemistry exam&mdash;which is often on the first day of finals&mdash;at precisely the stroke of midnight, the <a>Columbia University Marching Band</a> occupies <a>Butler Library</a> to distract diligent students from studying.
After a forty-five minutes or so of jokes and music, the procession then moves out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there.
The Band then plays at various other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of <a>Barnard College</a>, where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash &#x2014; including notes and course packets &#x2014; and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above.
The Band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly &quot;anti-social&quot; residence hall, where the underclassmen in the Band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the various stereotypes about the Columbia student body.</p>
<h4>Tree-Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|College Walk is illuminated in the winter months</a> The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony is a relatively new tradition at Columbia, inaugurated in 1998.
It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December.
The lights remain on until February&nbsp;28.
Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by various <em>a cappella</em> groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.</p>
<p>Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log.
The ceremony dates to a period prior to the <a>Revolutionary War</a>, but lapsed before being revived by University President <a>Nicholas Murray Butler</a> in the early 20th&nbsp;century.
A troop of students dressed as <a>Continental Army</a> soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The ceremony is accompanied by a reading of <em><a>A Visit From St. Nicholas</a></em> by <a>Clement Clarke Moore</a> (CC 1798) and <em><a>Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus</a></em> by <a>Francis Pharcellus Church</a> (CC 1859).</p>
<h4>The Varsity Show</h4>
