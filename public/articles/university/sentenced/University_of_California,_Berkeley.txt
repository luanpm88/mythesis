<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Cal</strong>, <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Berkeley</strong> and <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>) is a <a>public research university</a> located in <a>Berkeley, California</a>, <a>United States</a>, in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The oldest of the ten major campuses affiliated with the <a>University of California</a>, the University was founded in 1868 in a merger of the private <a>College of California</a> and the public Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College.
The university occupies  with the central campus resting on approximately &lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Facts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the <a>San Francisco Bay Area</a>.
</p>
<p>Berkeley offers around 300 undergraduate and <a>graduate degree</a> programs in a wide range of disciplines, and the university has the highest number of graduate programs ranked in the top 10 in their fields by the <a>United States National Research Council</a>.
Among other distinctions, University faculty, alumni, and researchers have won 66 <a>Nobel Prize</a>s, 9 <a>Wolf Prize</a>s, 7 <a>Fields Medal</a>s, 12 <a>Turing Award</a>s, 43 <a>MacArthur Fellowship</a>s, 19 <a>Academy Award</a>s, and 11 <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>s.</p>
<p>Cal student-athletes compete intercollegiately as the <em><a>California Golden Bears</a></em>.
A member of both the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> and the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in the <a>NCAA</a>, Cal students have won national titles in many sports, including football, men's basketball, baseball, men's gymnastics, softball, water polo, rugby, and crew.
In addition, they have won over 100 <a>Olympic</a> medals.
The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are <a>Yale Blue</a> and California <a>Gold</a>.</p>
<p>Berkeley was a founding member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.
Berkeley physicist <a>J.
Robert Oppenheimer</a> was the scientific director of the <a>Manhattan Project</a>, which he personally headquartered at <a>Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>, during <a>World War II</a>.
Since that time, the university has managed or co-managed the <a>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, as well as the <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and <a>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> for the <a>U.S.
Department of Energy</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:CampanileMtTamalpiasSunset-original.jpg|thumb|right|Sather
Tower (the Campanile) looking out over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and <a>Mount Tamalpais</a>.]] </p>
<p>In 1866, the land comprising the current Berkeley campus was purchased by the private <a>College of California</a>.
Because it lacked sufficient funds to operate, it eventually merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the <a>University of California</a>, the first full-curriculum public university in the state of California.
The university opened in September 1869.
<a>Andrew Gabrielson</a> was a trustee of the College of California and suggested that the college be named in honor of the <a>Anglo-Irish</a> philosopher <a>George Berkeley</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Berkeley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 <a>Henry Durant</a>, the founder of the College of California, became the first president.
With the completion of North and <a>South Halls</a> in 1873, the university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 222 female students and held its first classes.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Sunsite&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Beginning in 1891, <a>Phoebe Apperson Hearst</a> made several large gifts to Berkeley, funding a number of programs and new buildings, and sponsoring, in 1898, an international competition in Antwerp, Belgium, where French architect Emile Bernard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan.
In 1905, the University Farm was established near <a>Sacramento</a>, ultimately becoming the <a>University of California, Davis</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ucb_about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the number of campus buildings had grown substantially, and included twenty structures designed by architect <a>John Galen Howard</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Robert Gordon Sproul</a> served as president from 1930 to 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, the American Council on Education ranked UC Berkeley second only to <a>Harvard University</a> in the number of distinguished departments.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Presidents&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>During <a>World War II</a>, following <a>Glenn Seaborg</a>'s then-secret discovery of plutonium, <a>Ernest Orlando Lawrence</a>'s <a>Radiation Laboratory</a> began to contract with the <a>U.S. Army</a> to develop the <a>atomic bomb</a>.
UC Berkeley physics professor <a>J.
Robert Oppenheimer</a> was named scientific head of the <a>Manhattan Project</a> in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with the <a>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (formerly the Radiation Lab), Berkeley is now a partner in managing two other labs, <a>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> (1943) and <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (1952).</p>
<p>Originally, military training was compulsory for male undergraduates, and Berkeley housed an armory for that purpose.
In 1917, Cal's ROTC program was established, and its School of Military Aeronautics trained future pilots, including <a>Jimmy Doolittle</a>, who graduated with a B.A. in 1922.
Both <a>Robert McNamara</a> and <a>Frederick C. Weyand</a> graduated from Cal's ROTC program, earning B.A. degrees in 1937 and 1938, respectively.
During World War II, the military increased its presence on campus to recruit more officers, and by 1944, the student body at Berkeley included more than 1,000 Navy personnel.
The Board of Regents ended compulsory military training at Berkeley in 1962.</p>
<p>During the <a>McCarthy era</a> in 1949, the <a>Board of Regents</a> adopted an anti-<a>communist</a> <a>loyalty oath</a>.
A number of faculty members objected and were dismissed;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ten years passed before they were reinstated with back pay.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1952, the University of California became an entity separate from the Berkeley campus.
Each campus was given relative autonomy and its own Chancellor.
Then-president Sproul assumed presidency of the entire University of California system, and <a>Clark Kerr</a> became the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Presidents&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Memorial Glade, at the center of the Berkeley campus.</a>
Berkeley gained a reputation for student activism in the 1960s with the <a>Free Speech Movement</a> in 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkeley 60s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>opposition to the Vietnam War</a>.
In the highly publicized <a>People's Park</a> protest in 1969, students and the school conflicted over use of a plot of land; the <a>National Guard</a> was called in and violence erupted.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Berkeley 60s&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Modern students at Berkeley are less politically active, with a greater percentage of moderates and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of 9:1.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Various human and animal rights groups have recently conflicted with Berkeley.
<a>Native American</a>s conflicted with the school over repatriation of remains from the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Animal-rights</a> activists have threatened faculty members using animals for research.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The school's response to <a>tree sitters</a> protesting construction caused controversy in the local community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>As state funding (now about 25%) has declined,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley has turned to private sources: <a>BP</a> donated $500 million to develop <a>biofuel</a>s, the Hewlett Foundation gave $113 million to endow 100 <a>faculty chair</a>s, and <a>Dow Chemical</a> gave $10 million to research <a>sustainability</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Paddock&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The BP grant has been criticized for <a>diverting food production</a> to fuel production.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Burress&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AcademicSenate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The original name <em>University of California</em> was frequently shortened to <em>California</em> or <em>Cal</em>.
Its athletic teams date to this time and so are known as the <em><a>California Golden Bears</a></em>, <em>Cal Bears</em>, or <em>Cal</em>.
Today <em>University of California</em> refers to a statewide school system and the official name is <em>University of California, Berkeley</em>, frequently shortened to <em>UC Berkeley</em>, <em>Berkeley</em>, <em>Cal.</em>
Usage of <em>UCB</em> and <em>University of California <strong>at</strong> Berkeley</em> is discouraged&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the domain name is <code>berkeley.edu</code>.
The term &quot;Cal Berkeley&quot; is not a correct reference to the school, but occasionally used.
Berkeley is unrelated to the <a>Berklee College of Music</a> or <a>Berkeley College</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately , though the &quot;central campus&quot; occupies only the low-lying western  of this area.
Of the remaining , approximately  are occupied by the <a>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>; other facilities above the main campus include the <a>Lawrence Hall of Science</a> and several research units, notably the <a>Space Sciences Laboratory</a>, the <a>Mathematical Sciences Research Institute</a>, an undeveloped  ecological preserve, the <a>University of California Botanical Garden</a> and a recreation center in Strawberry Canyon.
To the west of the central campus is the <a>downtown business district of Berkeley</a>; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called <a>Gourmet Ghetto</a>, a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as <a>Chez Panisse</a>.
Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as <a>Northside</a> with a large graduate student population; situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the <a>Berkeley Hills</a>, where many faculty members live.
Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row, and beyond that the <a>Clark Kerr Campus</a> and an upscale residential area named <a>Claremont</a>.
The <a>area south of the university</a> includes student housing and <a>Telegraph Avenue</a>, one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists.
In addition, the University also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a  married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany (&quot;Albany Village&quot; and the &quot;Gill Tract&quot;), and a field research station several miles to the north in <a>Richmond, California</a>.
Outside of the Bay Area, the University owns various research laboratories and research forests in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>[[Image:South Hall--UC Berkeley--Panoramic.jpg|thumb|left|[[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] (1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus]] What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 &quot;International Competition for the <a>Phoebe Hearst</a> Architectural Plan for the University of California,&quot; funded by <a>William Randolph Hearst</a>'s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of <a>Antwerp</a>; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Online
Exhibit on the Hearst Architectural Competition</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was Frenchman <a>&#x00c9;mile B&#x00e9;nard</a>, however he refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professor <a>John Galen Howard</a>.
Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s.
The structures forming the &#x201c;classical core&#x201d; of the campus were built in the <a>Beaux-Arts</a> Classical style, and include <a>Hearst Greek Theatre</a>, <a>Hearst Memorial Mining Building</a>, <a>Doe Memorial Library</a>, California Hall, <a>Wheeler Hall</a>, (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, <a>Sather Gate</a>, and the  <a>Sather Tower</a> (nicknamed &quot;the Campanile&quot; after its architectural inspiration, <a>St Mark's Campanile</a> in Venice).
Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly &quot;serious&quot; were designed in shingle or <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> styles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall.
Many of Howard's designs are recognized <a>California Historical Landmark</a>s and are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>Built in 1873 in a <a>Victorian</a> Second-Empire-style, <a>South Hall</a> is the oldest university building in California.
It, and the <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>-designed <a>Piedmont Avenue</a> east of the main campus, are the only remnants from the original University of California before John Galen Howard's buildings were constructed.
Other architects whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area are <a>Bernard Maybeck</a>&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (best known for the <a>Palace of Fine Arts</a> in San Francisco), Maybeck's student <a>Julia Morgan</a> (Hearst Women's Gymnasium), <a>Charles Willard Moore</a> (<a>Haas School of Business</a>) and <a>Joseph Esherick</a> (Wurster Hall).</p>
<h3>Natural features</h3>
<p>[[Image:Strawberry Creek near Dwinelle Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Strawberry
Creek]], as seen between Dwinelle Hall and Lower Sproul Plaza.]]
Flowing into the main campus are two branches of <a>Strawberry Creek</a>.
The south fork enters a culvert upstream of the recreational complex at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon and passes beneath <a>California Memorial Stadium</a> before appearing again in Faculty Glade.
It then runs through the center of the campus before disappearing underground at the west end of campus.
The north fork appears just east of <a>University House</a> and runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum.</p>
<p>Trees in the area date from the founding of the University in the 1870s.
The campus, itself, contains numerous wooded areas; including: <a>Founders' Rock</a>, Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and the <a>Eucalyptus</a> Grove, which is both the tallest stand of such trees in the world and the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America.&lt;ref&gt;<a>UC

<p>The campus sits on the <a>Hayward Fault</a>, which runs directly through <a>California Memorial Stadium</a>.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing construction to retrofit the stadium.
The &quot;treesit&quot; protest revolved around the controversy of clearing away trees by the stadium to build the new Student Athlete High Performance Center.
As the stadium sits directly on the fault, this raised campus concerns of the safety of student athletes in the event of an earthquake as they train in facilities under the stadium stands.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Campus
provides updates on Memorial Stadium Project and Student-Athlete High Performance Center&quot;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Student housing</h3>
<p> UC Berkeley's student housing accommodates a variety of personal and academic preferences and styles.
Presently, the university offers two years of guaranteed housing for entering freshmen, and one year for entering transfer students.
The immediately surrounding community offers apartments, Greek (fraternity and sorority) housing, and the <a>Berkeley Student Cooperative</a> (an organization of about twenty cooperatively run student homes).</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Cunningham Hall and the newly built Towle Hall, part of the Unit 2 residence hall complex</a>There are four residence hall complexes south of campus in the City of Berkeley: Units 1, 2, 3, and Clark Kerr.
Units 1, 2 and 3 offer <a>high-rise</a> accommodations with common areas on every other floor.
Dining commons and other central facilities are shared by the high-rises.
Because of their communal design and location in the city, these residence halls tend to be the more social of the housing options.
Units 1 and 2 also have many of the newest residence hall buildings, which are intended for continuing and transfer students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>01.11.2005 - New residence halls, new students arrive for spring semester&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Just outside these complexes are the Channing-Bowditch and Ida Jackson apartments, also intended for older students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>housing.berkeley.edu</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Jackson
House</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Farther away from campus is Clark Kerr, a residence hall complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.
This complex is considered the most spacious and luxurious accommodation south of campus.</p>
<p>[[Image:Bowles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bowles
Hall]] at the 2003 Homecoming and Parents Weekend]]In the foothills, east of the central campus, there are three additional residence hall complexes: Foothill, Stern, and Bowles.
Foothill is a co-ed suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet.
Just south of Foothill, overlooking the <a>Hearst Greek Theatre</a>, is the all-girls traditional-style Stern Hall, which boasts an original mural by <a>Diego Rivera</a>.
Because of their proximity to the <a>College of Engineering</a> and <a>College of Chemistry</a>, these residence halls often house science and engineering majors.
They tend to be quieter than the <a>southside</a> complexes, but because of their location next to the theatre, often get free glimpses of concerts.
<a>Bowles Hall</a>, the oldest state-owned residence hall in California, is located immediately north of <a>California Memorial Stadium</a>.
Dedicated in 1929 and on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>, this all-men's residence hall has large quad-occupancy rooms and has the appearance of a castle.</p>
<p>Family student housing consists of two main groups of housing: <a>University Village</a> and Smyth-Fernwald.
University Village is located three miles (5&nbsp;km) north-west of campus in <a>Albany, California</a>.
The demolition of older buildings and their subsequent replacement with new, more expensive apartment units has prompted student protests.
The Village Residents Association, a funding and advocacy group in University Village, filmed a video documentary regarding the lack of affordable student family housing in June, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Affordable

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>In 2009, UC Berkeley developed the Climate Action Plan, pledging to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by one-third, and eventually to achieve climate neutrality.
The university tries to use as much post-consumer waste recycled copy paper as possible.&lt;ref
name=&quot;UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ReUse project allows for people to share unneeded office supplies and equipment.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Bright Green Questions and Answers&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The Berkeley Green Campus Program is a student-led initiative, involving energy reduction challenges, light bulb swaps, and other programs designed to reduce the campus's <a>eco-footprint</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkeley Green Campus Program | Big Ideas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UC Berkeley's efforts toward sustainability earned the school a B on the College Sustainability Report Card; overall, the school's grades within the sections were high&#x2014;it earned A's in the majority of the Report Card.</p>
<h2>Organization and administration</h2>
<p>Berkeley is the oldest of the ten major campuses affiliated with the <a>University of California</a>.
The University of California is governed by a 26-member <a>Board of Regents</a>, 18 of which are appointed by the <a>Governor of California</a> to 12-year terms, 7 serving as <em><a>ex officio</a></em> members, and a single student regent.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Governance&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Chancellor was created in 1952 to lead individual campuses.
The Board appointed <a>Robert J. Birgeneau</a> to be the 9th Chancellor of the university in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 12 vice chancellors report directly to the Chancellor.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost serves as the chief academic officer and is the office to which the deans of the 14 colleges and schools report.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>[[Image:Haas School of Business courtyard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haas

<h2>Student life and traditions</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Sather gate and Sather tower (the Campanile) from Sproul Plaza on the UC Berkeley campus</a> The official university mascot is <a>Oski the Bear</a>, who first debuted in 1941.
Previously, live bear cubs were used as mascots at <a>Memorial Stadium</a>.
It was decided in 1940 that a costumed mascot would be a better alternative to a live bear.
Named after the <a>Oski-wow-wow</a> yell, he is cared for by the Oski Committee, whose members have exclusive knowledge of the identity of the costume-wearer.&lt;ref&gt;<a>California

<p>The <a>University of California Marching Band</a>, which has served the university since 1891, performs at every home football game and at select road games as well.
A smaller subset of the Cal Band, the Straw Hat Band, performs at basketball games, volleyball games, and other campus and community events.&lt;ref&gt;<a>University of California Marching Band ~ About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>UC Rally Committee</a>, formed in 1901, is the official guardian of California's Spirit and Traditions.
Wearing their traditional blue and gold rugbies, Rally Committee members can be seen at all major sporting and spirit events.
Committee members are charged with the maintenance of the five Cal flags, the large California banner overhanging the Memorial Stadium Student Section and <a>Haas Pavilion</a>, the California Victory Cannon, Card Stunts and <a>The Big &quot;C&quot;</a> among other duties.
The Rally Committee is also responsible for safekeeping of the <a>Stanford Axe</a> when it is in Cal's possession.&lt;ref&gt;<a>UC

<p>Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, <a>The Big &quot;C&quot;</a> is an important symbol of California school spirit.
The Big &quot;C&quot; has its roots in an early 20th century campus event called &quot;Rush,&quot; which pitted the freshman and sophomore classes against each other in a race up Charter Hill that often developed into a wrestling match.
It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build the Big &quot;C&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Days of Cal | Bear Traditions&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its prominent position, the Big &quot;C&quot; is often the target of pranks by rival <a>Stanford University</a> students who paint the Big &quot;C&quot; red and also fraternities and sororities who paint it their organization's colors.
One of the Rally Committee's functions is to repaint the Big &quot;C&quot; to its traditional color of King Alfred Yellow.</p>
<p>Cal students invented the college football tradition of <a>card stunts</a>.
Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910 <a>Big Game</a> and consisted of two stunts: a picture of the <a>Stanford Axe</a> and a large blue &quot;C&quot; on a white background.
The tradition continues today in the Cal student section and incorporates complicated motions, for example tracing the Cal script logo on a blue background with an imaginary yellow pen.&lt;ref&gt;<a>California

<p>The California Victory Cannon, placed on <a>Tightwad Hill</a> overlooking the stadium, is fired before every football home game, after every score, and after every Cal victory.
First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to <a>Tightwad Hill</a> in 1971.
The only time the cannon ran out of ammunition was during a game against <a>Pacific</a> in 1991, when Cal scored 12 touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;<a>California

<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p>[[Image:Cal band.JPG|thumb|Cal Straw Hat Band (a smaller subset of the Cal Band) playing at [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] in <a>San Diego, California</a>]] UC Berkeley has over 700 established student groups.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has a reputation for <a>student activism</a>, stemming from the 1960s and the <a>Free Speech Movement</a>.
Today, Berkeley is known as a lively campus with activism in many forms, from email petitions, presentations on <a>Sproul Plaza</a> and volunteering, to the occasional protest.
Political student groups on campus numbered 94 during the 2006&#x2013;2007 school year, including Berkeley MEChA, Berkeley <a>ACLU</a>, Berkeley Students for Life, Campus Greens, Cal Berkeley Democrats, and the Berkeley College Republicans.
Berkeley sends the most students to the <a>Peace Corps</a> of any university in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Berkeley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>IDEAL Scholars Fund</a> was established by four alumni to increase the number of underrepresented minorities at UC Berkeley.
The Fund tries to counter the perceived effects of California <a>Proposition 209</a>, which ended <a>Affirmative Action</a> in <a>California</a> and in the <a>University of California</a> system.
Some claimed there was a reduction in the numbers of Latino, African American and Native American students and rekindled their activism on campus concerning issues of race.
However, supporters of <a>Proposition 209</a> have noted that the number of Asian American students, a small minority group nationally but a large minority group in California, has dramatically increased following its passage.
Racial preferences remain a controversial topic, with some students supporting them while others are opposed to what they see as reverse racism, especially against Asian American students.
[[Image:Berkeley DM 2009.JPG|thumb|left|[[Berkeley Dance Marathon|Dance Marathon]], one of the campus's student-led fundraising events.]]</p>
<p>The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is the <a>student government</a> organization that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events.
It is considered one of the most autonomous student governments at any <a>public university</a> in the U.S. The two main political parties are &quot;Student Action&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Student Action Webpage</a>&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;CalSERVE.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;<a>CalSERVE
Webpage</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in 1887 and has a budget of $2 million.</p>
<p>The Residence Hall Assembly (RHA) is the student-run residence hall organization that oversees all aspects of residence wide event planning, legislation, sponsorships and activities for over 6000 on-campus undergraduate residents.
Founded in 1988 by the President's Council, it is now funded and supported by the Residential and Student Service Programs department on campus.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley's student-run online television station, <a>CalTV</a>, was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online.
It is run by students with a variety of backgrounds and majors.
It can be viewed at <a>caltv.org</a>.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper is <em><a>The Daily Californian</a></em>. Founded in 1871, <em>The Daily Cal</em> became independent in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors for encouraging readers to take back <a>People's Park</a>.</p>
<p>Berkeley's FM radio station, <a>KALX</a>, broadcasts on 90.7&nbsp;MHz.
It is run largely by volunteers, including both students and community members.</p>
<p>Berkeley Model United Nations is the oldest running high school Model United Nations conference in the nation holding an annual conference on campus with over 1500 high school students participating.</p>
<p>The Berkeley Group&lt;ref&gt;<a>The Berkeley Group</a>&lt;/ref&gt; is a student consulting organization affiliated with UC Berkeley and the <a>Haas School of Business</a>.
Students of all majors are recruited and trained to work on pro-bono consulting engagements with real-life nonprofit clients.</p>
<p>ImagiCal has been the college chapter of the <a>American Advertising Federation</a> at Berkeley since the late 1980's.
Every year, the team competes in the <a>National Student Advertising Competition</a>.
Students from various backgrounds come together to work on a marketing case provided by the AAF and a corporate sponsor to college chapters across the nation.
Most recently, the UC Berkeley team won in their respective regions in both 2005 and 2009, eventually going on to win 4th and 3rd in the nation, respectively.</p>
<p>Democratic Education at Cal, or DeCal, is a program that promotes the creation of professor-sponsored, student-facilitated classes through the Special Studies 98/198 program.
DeCal arose out of the 1960s <a>Free Speech movement</a> and was officially established in 1981.
The program offers around 150 courses on a vast range of subjects that appeal to the Berkeley student community, including classes on <em><a>The Simpsons</a></em>, <a>The Beatles</a>, <a>James Bond</a>, <a>Poker</a>, <a>South Park</a>, <a>Superman</a>, <a>Batman</a>, <a>The Iranian Revolution</a>, <a>conspiracy theories</a>, <a>political</a> <a>debate</a>, <a>meditation</a> and <a>DJing</a>.
Additionally, the &quot;Politics of Piracy&quot; DeCal participates in the Wikimedia <a>Public Policy Initiative</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There are many <a>a cappella</a> groups on campus; two of the most popular are the <a>UC Men's Octet</a> and The <a>California Golden Overtones</a>.
The <a>UC Men's Octet</a> is an eight-member a cappella group founded in 1948 featuring a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs.
They are one of only two multiple time champions of the <a>ICCA</a>, having won the championship in both 1998 and 2000.
The <a>California Golden Overtones</a>, founded in 1984, have a very similar repertoire to the Octet.
</p>
<p>It is a tradition for every Berkeley a cappella group to perform under the campus' iconic <a>Sather Gate</a> each week and the Octet and overtones are no exception; during the academic year you can hear the Octet every Wednesday at 1 PM and the Overtones every Friday at 1 PM with other groups performing at similar times on different days; <a>Artists in Resonance</a> performs Mondays at Noon, <a>Noteworthy</a> performs Tuesdays at 12:30PM and <a>DeCadence</a> performs Wednesdays at Noon. </p>
<p>In addition to a Capella, Berkeley is host to a myriad of other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music.
A few examples include <a>jericho!
Improv &amp; Sketch Comedy</a>, Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, and the Remedy Music Project.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley also hosts a large number of conferences, talks, and musical and theatrical performances.
Many of these events, including the <a>Annual UC Berkeley Sociological Research Symposium</a>, are completely planned and organized by undergraduate students.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> Cal's sports teams compete in intercollegiate athletics as the <a>California Golden Bears</a>.
They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I-A as a member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.
The official school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, are Yale Blue and California Gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource Guide: Student history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Yale Blue was chosen because many of the university's founders were <a>Yale University</a> graduates (for example Henry Durant, the first university president), while California Gold was selected to represent the Golden State of California.
Cal has a long history of excellence in athletics, having won national titles in football, men's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's crew, men's gymnastics, men's tennis, men's and women's swimming, men's water polo, men's Judo, men's track, and men's rugby.
In addition, Cal athletes have won numerous individual NCAA titles in track, gymnastics, swimming and tennis.
On January 31, 2009, the school's <a>Hurling</a> club made athletic history by defeating <a>Stanford</a> in the first collegiate hurling match ever to be played on American soil.</p>
<p>California finished in first place&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/Jan.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2007&#x2013;2008 Fall U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup standings (Formerly the Sears Cup), which measures the best overall collegiate athletic programs in the country, with points awarded for national finishes in NCAA sports.
Cal finished with 370 points.
California finished in ninth place&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2006-07 U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup.
With 1030.00 points, this is Cal's highest point value in school history.
California finished in sixth place&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/0506D1June22Stand.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt; in the NACDA <a>Director's Cup</a> standings, with points awarded for national finishes in NCAA sports.
With 865.5 points, Cal's seventh place finish is the highest in the school's history.
Following the end of the 2008 season, California accepted an invitation to play the <a>University of Miami</a> in the December 27 <a>Emerald Bowl</a>.</p>

Golden Bears' traditional arch-rivalry is with the <a>Stanford</a> Cardinal.
The most anticipated sporting event between the two universities is the annual football game dubbed the <a>Big Game</a>, and it is celebrated with spirit events on both campuses.
Since 1933, the winner of the Big Game has been awarded custody of <a>the Stanford Axe</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most famous moments in Big Game history occurred during the 85th Big Game on November 20, 1982.
In what has become known as &quot;the band play&quot; or simply <a>The Play</a>, Cal scored the winning touchdown in the final seconds with a kickoff return that involved a series of laterals and the Stanford marching band rushing onto the field.</p>
<h3>National championships</h3>
<p>Berkeley teams have won national championships in baseball (2), men's basketball (2), men's crew (15), women's crew (3), football (8), men's golf (1), men's gymnastics (4), men's lacrosse (1), men's rugby (24), softball (1), men's swimming (2), women's swimming (1), men's tennis (1), men's track &amp; field (1), and men's water polo (13).</p>

&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Berkeley alumni nurtured a number of key technologies associated with the <a>personal computer</a> and the development of the <a>Internet</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Berkeley
Unix worked so well that <a>DARPA</a> chose it to be the preferred 'universal computing environment' linking together <a>Arpanet</a> research nodes, thus setting in place an essential piece of infrastructure for the later growth of the Internet.
An entire generation of computer scientists cut their teeth on Berkeley Unix.
Without it, the Net might well have evolved into a shape similar to what it is today, but with it, the Net exploded.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Unix</a> was created by alumnus <a>Ken Thompson</a> (BS 1965, MS 1966) along with colleague <a>Dennis Ritchie</a>.
Alumni such as <a>L.
Peter Deutsch</a>&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch was awarded a 1992 citation by the <a>Association for Computing Machinery</a> for his work on <a>Interlisp</a>()&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.
Peter Deutsch is profiled on pages 30, 31, 43, 53, 54, 66 (which mentions Deutsch beginning his freshman year at Berkeley), and page 87 in the following book: &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.
Peter Deutsch is profiled in pages 69, 70-72, 118, 146, 227, 230, 280, 399 of the following book: &lt;/ref&gt; (PhD 1973), <a>Butler Lampson</a> (PhD 1967), and <a>Charles P. Thacker</a> (BS 1967)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; worked with Ken Thompson on <a>Project Genie</a> and then formed the ill-fated <a>US Department of Defense</a>-funded Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC), which was scattered throughout the Berkeley campus in non-descript offices to avoid anti-war protestors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
After BCC failed, Deutsch, Lampson, and Thacker joined <a>Xerox PARC</a>, where they developed a number of pioneering computer technologies, culminating in the <a>Xerox Alto</a> that inspired the <a>Apple Macintosh</a>.
In particular, the Alto used a <a>computer mouse</a>, which had been invented by <a>Doug Engelbart</a> (B.Eng 1952, Ph.D. 1955).
Thompson, Lampson, Engelbart, and Thacker&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; all later received a <a>Turing Award</a>.
Also at Xerox PARC was Ronald V. Schmidt (BS 1966, MS 1968, PhD 1971), who became known as &quot;the man who brought <a>Ethernet</a> to the masses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Another Xerox PARC researcher, <a>Charles Simonyi</a> (BS 1972), pioneered the first <a>WYSIWIG</a> <a>word processor</a> program and was recruited personally by <a>Bill Gates</a> to join the fledgling company known as <a>Microsoft</a> to create <a>Microsoft Word</a>.
Simonyi later became the first repeat <a>space tourist</a>, blasting off on Russian <a>Soyuz</a> rockets to work at the <a>International Space Station</a> orbiting the earth.</p>
<p>In 1977, a graduate student in the computer science department named <a>Bill Joy</a> (MS 1982) assembled &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the original <a>Berkeley Software Distribution</a>, commonly known as <a>BSD Unix</a>.
Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the <a>terminal</a> console editor <a>vi</a>, while <a>Ken Arnold</a> (BA 1985) created <a>Curses</a>, a <a>terminal</a> control <a>library</a> for <a>Unix-like</a> systems that enables the construction of <a>text user interface (TUI)</a> applications.
Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates <a>William Jolitz</a> (BS 1997) and his future wife <a>Lynne Jolitz</a> (BA 1989), who together created <a>386BSD</a>, which is a version of BSD Unix that runs on <a>Intel</a> CPUs, and later evolved into the <a>Darwin operating system</a> for the <a>Apple Macintosh</a>'s <a>Mac OS X</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<a>Eric Allman</a> (BS 1977, MS 1980) created <a>SendMail</a>, a Unix <a>mail transfer agent</a> that delivers 70% of the <a>email</a> in the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>XCF</a>, an undergraduate research group located in <a>Soda Hall</a>, has been responsible for a number of notable software projects, including <a>GTK+</a> (created by <a>Peter Mattis</a>, BS 1997), <a>The GIMP</a> (<a>Spencer Kimball</a>, BS 1996), and the initial diagnosis of the <a>Morris worm</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1992 <a>Pei-Yuan Wei</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Pei-Yuan Wei's contributions are profiled on pages 56, 64, 68, and 83, in the <a>World Wide Web</a> creator's autobiography ()&lt;/ref&gt; an undergraduate at the XCF, created <a>ViolaWWW</a>, one of the first graphical web browsers.
ViolaWWW was the first browser to have embedded scriptable objects, stylesheets, and tables.
In the spirit of Open Source, he donated the code to Sun Microsystems, inspiring <a>Java</a> applets( <a>Kim Polese</a> (BS 1984) was the original product manager for Java at Sun Microsystems.)
ViolaWWW also inspired researchers at the <a>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> to create the <a>Mosaic web browser</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering <a>web browser</a> that became Microsoft <a>Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
