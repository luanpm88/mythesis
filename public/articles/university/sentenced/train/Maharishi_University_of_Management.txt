<p><strong>Maharishi University of Management</strong> (<strong>MUM</strong>), formerly known as Maharishi International University, was founded in 1973 by <a>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>, who developed the <a>Transcendental Meditation technique</a>.
The campus is located in <a>Fairfield, Iowa</a>, United States, on the grounds of the former <a>Parsons College</a>.</p>
<p>The university is not for profit, and accredited through the Ph.D. level by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
It offers &quot;consciousness-based education&quot; that includes practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique.
Degree programs are offered in the arts, sciences, business, and the humanities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|MUM campus sign</a> Transcendental Meditation teachers conceived the university and <a>Nat Goldhaber</a> established it in 1971.
Maharishi International University (MIU) was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
Robert Keith Wallace became its first president in 1973.
Its first location was an apartment complex in <a>Goleta</a>, a small community near <a>Santa Barbara, California</a>, where it began with one hundred students and thirty-five faculty members.</p>
<p>After moving to the Fairfield campus, MIU was listed as a &quot;candidate for accreditation&quot; in 1975 In 1983, Morris organized a special three-week &quot;Taste of Utopia&quot; gathering in December 1983 and January 1984 which attracted more than 7,000 practitioners of the <a>TM-Sidhi</a> program.
He later reported that reduced world tensions and a higher <a>Dow Jones stock index</a> occurred during, and as a result of, this event.</p>
<p>In 1995, Maharishi International University changed its name to Maharishi University of Management (MUM).
Local preservationists protested the demolition in 2000 of Parsons Hall, built in 1915, and of Barhydt Chapel, designed in 1911 by <a>Henry K. Holsman</a>.
An effort was made to move the chapel to a new location.
University officials said that MUM would donate it to a community group if they could raise the $1 million needed to move what the <em><a>Fairfield Ledger</a></em> described as an &quot;ailing building&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a>Maharishi University of Management stabbing</a> occurred in 2001 when Shuvender Sem, a student at MUM, attacked two other students in separate incidents.
He stabbed the first student with a pen and hours later fatally stabbed Levi Butler with a knife.
Sem was found <a>not guilty due to insanity</a> and the university settled a lawsuit that charged it with negligence.
Maharishi said of the incident that &quot;this is an aspect of the violence we see throughout society&quot;, including the violence that the U.S. perpetrates in other countries.
The 2008 event included musical performances by <a>Donovan</a>, <a>Moby</a> and <a>Chrysta Bell</a>.
The 4th annual event, November 12&#x2013;16, 2009 featured Donovan, MUM professor <a>John Hagelin</a>, and the American debut of <a>James McCartney</a> who performed on November 14, 2009 at the <a>Fairfield Arts &amp; Convention Center</a> in <a>Fairfield, Iowa</a>.
The weekend conference was intended to appeal to those &quot;interested in creativity, film, art, sustainable living, <a>organic agriculture</a>, brain development, consciousness, meditation, natural medicine, renewable living, peace&quot;.</p>
<p>Actor, native Iowan, and Yogic flyer <a>Stephen Collins</a> was the featured speaker at the 2010 commencement ceremony.
He spoke to the 234 graduating students about his views on &quot;counter-culturalism&quot;.</p>
<h2>Board of trustees</h2>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>MUM is establishing itself as a leader in sustainable architecture among Iowa colleges and universities.
The University's efforts to create a sustainable campus includes the use of green, energy-efficient architecture and community planning that incorporates Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architecture - a system of country, town, village, and home planning.
</p>
<p>The University operates an organic vegetable farm including a , year-round greenhouse, which provides their students and faculty with a 100% organic food program.
</p>
<p>In 2010, the University began construction on a Sustainable Learning Center (SLC) building using the standards of Maharishi Vedic Architecture.
According to the University, the building will &quot;set a new global standard for green buildings&quot; by incorporating local building materials and being completely energy self-sufficient, even during construction.
The SLC will house both research and classroom activities and allow students to &quot;interactively monitor performance and energy efficiency&quot;.
University officials hope this building can prove that the county has the expertise for technological jumps of this kind.</p>

<h3>Development of consciousness</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Dome shaped building on MUM campus, for the group practice of the TM-Sidhi program and Yogic Flying</a> As a component of Consciousness-Based education, students and faculty practice the <a>Transcendental Meditation</a> technique and the <a>TM-Sidhi program</a> twice daily.</p>
<p>According to the student handbook, students are automatically enrolled in Development of Consciousness (DoC) classes every semester they are on campus, and must pass every DoC class to graduate.
Attendance is mandatory and recorded.
Falsification of the attendance record is a violation of the honor code, along with cheating and plagiarism.
Development of Consciousness topics include Group TM program, Individual TM checking, TM Experience meetings for Meditators, Advanced Knowledge Meetings for Sidhas, and World Peace Assemblies for Sidhas.</p>

The 2009 MUM Catalog omits the undergraduate SCI course; a course in Science and Technology of Consciousness appears in its place.
SCI remains a requirement for graduate programs.
SCI outlines a systematic understanding of consciousness that enables the students to connect any academic discipline to a holistic paradigm that includes themselves.</p>
<h3>Block system and academic day</h3>
<p>Maharishi University of Management operates on a block system.
Students take one course at a time during a four-week period.

The university has received more than $20 million in funding from different branches of the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other views of research</h3>
<p>In 1992, a <em><a>New York Times</a></em> article described Maharishi University as a place where all students and faculty meditate, and where the Maharishi's teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations.
The article describes MUM as &quot;an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students who mix transcendental meditation ... with serious academics studies striving to create their own new world&quot;.
The article said that even as the university gained research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faced controversy.
Curtis Mailloux (class of 1979), said the Fairfield campus is a &quot;coercive environment&quot; with a &quot;propensity for fraudulent research&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <em>Gazette</em> (Cedar Rapids and Iowa City) reported that, despite the fact that major medical schools might have in the past &quot;turned up their noses&quot; at studies MUM was conducting, millions of dollars had been awarded by the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, and  major universities, including the <a>University of Iowa</a>; <a>University of California, Irvine</a>; and <a>University of Hawaii</a>, were conducting research on alternative medicine and therapies with MUM.
Maharishi University and the University of Iowa, the article reported, were working on a study that looked at whether holistic therapy can effect the slowing or progression of  heart disease.</p>
<p>Former MUM professors have criticized the research conducted at MUM and the uses to which that research is put, including to obtain tax exempt status, as fraudulent.
Former MUM professor of economics and business law, Anthony DeNaro, stated in 1986 that there is &quot;a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud...designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science&quot;.
Dennis Roark, former Dean of Faculty and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, stated in a 1987 letter that he believed negative data was routinely suppressed in MUM research, and that scientific claims as to both the beneficial effects of TM and physics &quot;are not only without reasonable basis, but are in fact in many ways fraudulent.&quot;
Roark stated that he had questioned MUM professor Michael Dilbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck admitted that it was impossible to make EEG measurements while the subjects were moving.
Roark also wrote that when he was on faculty in the 1970s he questioned other investigators regarding studies of alleged crime reduction as a result of the Maharishi Effect, and they admitted to suppressing negative data and using only data that supported favorable conclusions.</p>
<h2>Reception</h2>
<p>According to the <em>New York Times</em>, some former members of the movement have called MUM a &quot;training ground&quot; for a cult.
Non-student members of the movement have moved to Fairfield so they can join in group sessions in the university's golden domes, and to help establish world peace.
that, as practiced at MUM, Transcendental Meditation is &quot;a cult rather than a culture&quot;.
D'Antonio wrote that Transcendental Meditation was like the worst of religion: rigid, unreasonable, repressive, and authoritarian, characterized by overt manipulation, a disregard for serious scholarship, and an unwillingness to question authority.
For the first time in his travels he found people he believed to be truly deluded, and a physics department teaching theories that were dead wrong.
D&#x2019;Antonio charges that they have taken Transcendental Meditiation &quot;into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightment&quot;.</p>
<h2>Popular culture</h2>
<p><a>The Beach Boys</a> recorded their 1979 album <em><a>M.I.U.
Album</a></em> on the campus, and named it after the university.
<em><a>Man on the Moon</a></em>, a biopic of entertainer <a>Andy Kaufman</a>, includes a scene at Maharishi International University in which Kaufman is asked to leave a retreat because his behavior was unbecoming an enlightened individual.</p>
