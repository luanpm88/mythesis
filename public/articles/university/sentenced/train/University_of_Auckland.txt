<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>The University of Auckland began as a constituent of the <a>University of New Zealand</a>, founded on 23 May 1883 as Auckland University College.
Stewardship of the University during its establishment period fell under the tenure of <a>John Chapman Andrew</a> (Vice Chancellor of the University of New Zealand 1885-1903).
Housed in a disused courthouse and jail, it started out with only 95 students and 4 teaching staff, but by 1901, student numbers had risen to 156.
Most of the students were training towards being law clerks or teachers and were enrolled only part-time.
From 1905 onwards, an increasing number of students enrolled in commerce studies.</p>
<p>The University conducted little research until the 1930s, when there was a spike in interest in academic research during the depression.
At this point, the college's executive council issued in several resolutions in favour of academic freedom after the controversial dismissal of <a>J.
C. Beaglehole</a>, allegedly for a letter to a newspaper where he publicly defended the right of communists to distribute their literature, which helped encourage the college's growth.</p>
<p>Soon after, in 1934, four new professors joined the college; Arthur Sewell (English), H.G Forder (Mathematics), C. G. Cooper (Classics) and James Rutherford (History).
The combination of new talent, and academic freedom, saw Auckland University College flourish through to the 1950s.</p>
<h3>Current events</h3>
<p>Professor Stuart McCutcheon became Vice-Chancellor on 1 January 2005.
He was previously the Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington.
He succeeded Dr <a>John Hood</a> (PhD, Hon.
LLD), who was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the <a>University of Oxford</a>.</p>
<p>The University opened a <a>new business school building</a> in 2007, following the completion of the new Information Commons, to revitalize the School of Business.
It has recently gained International Accreditations for all its programmes and now completes the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; (<a>AMBA</a>, <a>EQUIS</a> and <a>AACSB</a>).</p>
<p>On 1 September 2004, the <a>Auckland College of Education</a> amalgamated with the University to form the newest Faculty of the University (by merging the School of Education (previously part of the Arts Faculty) and the college).
The faculty is based at the <a>Epsom</a> Campus of the former college, with an additional campus in <a>Whangarei</a>.</p>
<p>The North Shore Campus, established in 2001, was located in the suburb of <a>Takapuna</a>.
It offered the Bachelor of Business and Information Management degree.
At the end of 2006, the campus was closed and the degree relocated to the City campus.</p>
