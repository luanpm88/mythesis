<p>  <strong>The University of Western Ontario</strong> (known as <strong>Western</strong> or <strong>UWO</strong>) is a public research <a>university</a> located in <a>London, Ontario</a>.
It was founded in 1878 by Bishop <a>Isaac Hellmuth</a> of <a>Bishop's University</a> and the Anglican Diocese of Huron as <em>The Western University of London Ontario</em>.
<a>Huron College</a>, established in 1863 as an <a>Anglican</a> theological school, provided the basis for the new university.
The University covers 395 acres (1.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land on the north branch of the <a>Thames River</a> and the main campus consists of 75 buildings.
The university also has extensive land holdings outside of the main campus.</p>
<p>The <a>school colours</a> are purple and white due to its historical connection with Bishop's, and the school's motto is <em>Veritas et utilitas</em>, meaning <em>Truth and usefulness</em>.
It incorporated <a>Huron University College</a>, which had been founded in 1863.</p>

<h2>Faculties</h2>
<p><a>right|250px|thumb|Conron Hall</a> Western offers more than 200 different programs through its 12 faculties and schools and three affiliated colleges:.
<a>King's University College</a> has about 3,100 students (2003/2004), <a>Huron University College</a> about 1,000, and <a>Brescia University College</a> about 500.
</p>
<p>The University Community Centre is home to many student-run clubs and media outlets, including <em><a>The Gazette</a></em>, Western's daily <a>student newspaper</a>, tvWestern.ca,
the campus television station, and 94.9 <a>CHRW-FM</a>, legally known as Radio Western.
The campus also houses the popular student lounge with pub section, the Spoke, as well as the Wave, a restaurant/dance club.
School spirit runs high at Western, as social events are well attended.
Orientation (Frosh) Week and Homecoming are especially popular.
Western's O-Week is a $600,000 program, and the largest of its kind in Canada and University Students' Council representatives have led several seminars at other universities to share their experiences in running a successful orientation week program.</p>
<p>Western also provides generous <a>financial aid</a>, bursaries and competitive scholarship programs.
The University's top scholarships are the National Scholarships, which include the <em>President's Scholarship</em>, the <em>Faculty Scholarship</em> and the <em>National Merit Awards</em>.
However, unlike many top universities in Canada, Western offers almost no scholarships (need- or merit-based) to undergraduate <a>international student</a>s.</p>
<h3>Student groups and clubs</h3>
<p>Western is home to over 197 clubs for academic, religious, cultural, philanthropic and other pursuits, which are governed by the University Students' Council (USC).
Some of these groups are the <a>University of Western Ontario Debating Society</a>, the oldest student association at the university and one of the largest debating societies in Canada, the largest undergraduate pre-medical club in Canada (UWO Pre-Med Society), and student political clubs such as the Western Liberals, which is one of the largest Liberal university clubs in Canada.
The UWO Tories have hosted Conservative leader Tim Hudak, and many other notable speakers, while the Campus Coalition for Democracy attracted national attention when it hosted Ann Coulter at the Natural Sciences Building on Monday, March 22.
One of the largest club on campus is the infamous Purple Spur Society, which has been ranked in Macleans Magazine as having the number one student ski trip in all of Canada.</p>
<h3>Performances</h3>
<p>The <a>Don Wright Faculty of Music</a> offers over 300 concert performances of various styles throughout the year, most of which are open to the public.

<h3>Government</h3>
<p>The University Students' Council (USC) is a $22-million dollar corporation; over half of Western students are involved with the USC through the clubs system, the Orientation Program, and various forms of student councils.
In 2009, USC presidential candidate and eventual president-elect Emily Rowe caught national attention when her campaign video, a spoof of a popular Discovery Channel commercial, became one of the most viewed Canadian videos on YouTube and was referenced in a &quot;Maclean's Campus&quot; article.
The USC also publishes The <em><a>Gazette</a></em>, Canada's only daily student newspaper.
Founded in 1906 and given its present name in 1930, the Gazette is widely read across campus and is routinely the venue for comment and debate by students.</p>
<h3>Gazette</h3>
<p><em>The Gazette</em> is the student newspaper on campus and is widely-read both by students and faculty.
Published between Tuesday and Friday, the paper is edited and written entirely by undergraduate students.
The paper consists of multiple sections, including sports, fashion, news, and campus issues.
Many contributors to the newspaper began their involvement with a simple visit to the Gazette office, which can be found on the second floor of the University Community Centre.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Football at Western</a>Western has 37 Varsity sports teams, which are called <a>The University of Western Ontario Mustangs</a>.
From 1939 to 1948 the <a>football</a> team was undefeated, and they have won six <a>Vanier Cup</a>s.
For 30 years the football team was coached by John P. Metras, for whom the <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a>'s best defensive linesman award is named.
Football games have been broadcast continuously since 1980 on the Western station <a>94.9
CHRW</a>.
The men's basketball team has also won many championships.
Further, the men's squash team has won 26 consecutive <a>Ontario University Athletics</a> (OUA) titles, making it the most winning team in OUA history.
</p>
<p>In 1929 J.W. Little Stadium was built, named after former <a>Mayor of London</a> and vice-chairman of the Western Board of Governors <a>John William Little</a>.
This stadium served as the site of convocation until 1960, and continued to be used as a sports stadium until 2001 when it was torn down and replaced with TD-Waterhouse Stadium.
The new stadium was the primary site of the 2001 Summer <a>Canada Games</a>, which were held in London.</p>
<p>Until the 2005&#x2013;06 season, Western's men's hockey team played on campus at Thompson Arena, completed in January 1975 with a capacity of 4,159.
The arena also hosts an indoor track, while its <a>curling</a> rink is being removed as part of a large renovation to create additional recreational space.
Men's hockey games now take place in downtown London at the John Labatt Centre, also the home of the <a>London Knights</a>.
After years of debate, the Ontario University Athletics board of directors voted in May, 2006 to let schools provide athletic financial awards (AFAs) to first-year student-athletes.<a>thumb|right|250px|TD-Waterhouse
Stadium</a></p>
<p>Western is also home to one of Canada's two university-level marching bands, the <a>Western Mustang Band</a>.
It was started in 1938 by alumnus Don Wright (for whom the Music Faculty is now named).
The only other Canadian university marching band is the <a>Queen's Bands</a> of <a>Queen's University</a>.</p>
<p>The Mustang Cheerleading team, meanwhile, has won 24 of the last 25 Canadian Collegiate Championships (since 1985).
The squad, which was formed in 1924, is the longest running collegiate cheer team in Canada.</p>
<p>Athletics facilities on campus include the 10,000-seat <a>TD Waterhouse Stadium</a>, the Thompson Recreation and Athletic Centre, which contains an ice rink, an indoor track, curling sheets and tennis facilities, and Alumni Hall, a multi-purpose auditorium for basketball, volleyball, and other indoor events.
<a>Campus Recreation</a>, formerly in the University Community Centre basement, moved to a new Athletic Centre at the start of 2009.</p>
