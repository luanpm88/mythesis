<p> The <strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</strong> (also known as <strong>UNC</strong>, <strong>UNC-Chapel Hill</strong>, <strong>Chapel Hill</strong>, <strong>North Carolina</strong>, or simply <strong>Carolina</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Chapel Hill</a>, <a>North Carolina</a>, United States.
First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is one of multiple schools to claim the title of <a>oldest public university in the United States</a> and is one of the original eight schools known as a <a>Public Ivy</a>.
</p>
<p>All <a>undergraduate</a>s receive a <a>liberal arts</a> education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status.
In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as <em><a>BusinessWeek</a></em> and <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>.
The university forms one of the corners of the <a>Research Triangle</a> in addition to <a>Duke University</a> in <a>Durham</a> and <a>North Carolina State University</a> in <a>Raleigh</a>.</p>
<p>UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in <a>men's basketball</a> and <a>women's soccer</a> and men's lacrosse.
The <a>North Carolina Tar Heels</a> share rivalries with other <a>Tobacco Road</a> schools and have provided many <a>olympians</a> to <a>United States teams</a>.
The student newspaper <em><a>The Daily Tar Heel</a></em> has won national awards for collegiate media, while the <a>student radio</a> station <a>WXYC</a> provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> <a>Charter</a>ed by the <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> on December 11, 1789, the university's cornerstone was laid on October 12, 1793, near the ruins of a chapel, chosen because of its central location within the state.
Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States and the only such institution to confer degrees in the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>During the <a>Civil War</a>, <a>North Carolina Governor</a> <a>David Lowry Swain</a> persuaded <a>Confederate President</a> <a>Jefferson Davis</a> to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the <a>Confederacy</a> that managed to stay open.
However, <a>Chapel Hill</a> suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during <a>Reconstruction</a> from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875.</p>
<p>[[Image:Old Well.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Well]], a symbol of the University, stands at the heart of campus.]]
Despite initial skepticism from university President <a>Frank Porter Graham</a>, on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the <a>State College of Agriculture and Engineering</a> and the <a>Woman's College</a> to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina.
In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully <a>coeducational</a>.
As a result, the Woman's College was renamed the &quot;<a>University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a>&quot;, and the University of North Carolina became the &quot;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&quot;
Predating the other two schools by 98&nbsp;years, UNC became the <em>de facto</em> <a>flagship university</a> of the new statewide system.
In 1955, UNC officially desegregated its undergraduate divisions.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest.
Prior to the passage of the <a>Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, protests about local <a>racial segregation</a> which began quietly in <a>Franklin Street</a> restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance.
The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 <a>Speaker Ban Law</a> prohibiting speeches by <a>communists</a> on state campuses in North Carolina.
The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor <a>William Brantley Aycock</a> and university President <a>William Friday</a>, but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965.
Small amendments to allow &quot;infrequent&quot; visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to <a>Marxist</a> speaker <a>Herbert Aptheker</a> and civil liberties activist <a>Frank Wilkinson</a>; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway.
Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened &quot;Dan Moore's Wall&quot; by <em><a>The Daily Tar Heel</a></em> for Governor <a>Dan K. Moore</a>.
A group of UNC students, led by Student Body President Paul Dickson, filed a lawsuit in <a>U.S. federal court</a>, and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down.</p>
<p>From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007.
This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the &quot;Carolina First&quot; fundraising campaign and an <a>endowment</a> that increased fourfold to over $2&nbsp;billion in just ten years.
Professor <a>Oliver Smithies</a> was awarded the <a>Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> in 2007 for his work in <a>genetics</a>.</p>
<p>Notable <a>leaders of the university</a> include the 26th Governor of North Carolina, <a>David Lowry Swain</a> (president 1835&ndash;1868); and <a>Edwin Anderson Alderman</a> (1896&ndash;1900), who was also president of <a>Tulane University</a> and the <a>University of Virginia</a>.
The current chancellor is <a>Holden Thorp</a>, who earned a bachelor of science degree from UNC in 1986, a Ph.D. in chemistry from the <a>California Institute of Technology</a> in 1989, and was a postdoctoral associate at <a>Yale University</a> from 1989 to 1990.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Morehead-Planetarium-at-UNC.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The
[[Morehead Planetarium]], designed by <a>Eggers &amp; Higgins</a>, first opened in 1949.]]
UNC's  campus is dominated by two central <a>quads</a>: Polk Place and McCorkle Place.
and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the <a>bill</a> requesting the university's <a>charter</a>.
Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the <a>Pit Preacher</a>.
The Morehead&ndash;Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour.
In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the <a>American Society of Landscape Architects</a> Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university &quot;works of art&quot; by T.A. Gaines in his book <em>The Campus as a Work of Art</em>.</p>
<p>The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as &quot;north campus,&quot; &quot;middle campus,&quot; and &quot;south campus.&quot;
North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries.
Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls.
Middle campus includes <a>Fetzer Field</a> and <a>Woollen Gymnasium</a> along with the Student Recreation Center, <a>Kenan Memorial Stadium</a>, Irwin Belk outdoor track, <a>Eddie Smith Field House</a>, <a>Boshamer Stadium</a>, <a>Carmichael Auditorium</a>, Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government, <a>School of Law</a>, George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls.]]
A new <a>satellite campus</a>, Carolina North, to be built on the site of <a>Horace Williams Airport</a> was approved in 2007.
This is planned to be primarily a <a>research park</a> with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The principles of sustainability have been integrated throughout much of UNC-Chapel Hill.
In the area of green building, the university requires that all new projects meet the requirements for <a>LEED</a> Silver certification and is in the process of building the first building in North Carolina to receive LEED Platinum status.</pre>
<p>UNC&#x2019;s award-winning co-generation facility produces one-fourth of the electricity and all of the steam used on campus.</pre>
<p>In 2006, the university and the <a>Town of Chapel Hill</a> jointly agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60% by 2050, becoming the first town-gown partnership in the country to do so.</pre>
<p>Through these efforts, the university achieved a &#x201c;A&minus;&#x201d; grade on the Sustainable Endowment Institute&#x2019;s College Sustainability Report Card 2010.</pre>
<p>Only 14 out of 300 universities received a higher score than this.</p>
<h3>Old Well and McCorkle Place</h3>
<p>The most enduring symbol of the university is the <a>Old Well</a>, a small neoclassical <a>rotunda</a> based on the Temple of Love in the <a>Gardens of Versailles</a>, in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school.
The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings, <a>Old East</a>, and Old West.
Also located in McCorkle Place is the <a>Davie Poplar</a> tree under which the university's founder, <a>William Richardson Davie</a>, supposedly selected the location for the university.
The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC.
Because of the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as <a>Hurricane Fran</a> in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III.
Another university landmark is the Confederate monument, known to students as <a>Silent Sam</a>, erected to commemorate UNC students who died fighting for the <a>Confederacy</a>.
The statue has at times been dogged by controversy, some critics claiming that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery, while others counter that &quot;Silent Sam&quot; is simply historical and a part of the rich heritage of the <a>South</a>.
The statue of a soldier holding a gun lacks a cartridge box, thus does not carry any ammunition and is a &quot;benign&quot; soldier.
The unarmed soldier was erected in 1913 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to honor the school's Confederate heroes.
The student members of the university's <a>Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies</a> are not allowed to walk on the grass of McCorkle Place out of respect for the unknown resting place of <a>Joseph Caldwell</a>, the university's founder.
&lt;/br&gt;The Morehead&ndash;Patterson bell tower was commissioned by <a>John Motley Morehead III</a>, the benefactor of the prestigious <a>Morehead Scholarship</a>.
The hedge and surrounding landscape was designed by <a>William C. Coker</a>, botany professor and creator of the <a>campus arboretum</a>.
Traditionally, seniors have the opportunity to climb the tower a few days prior to May commencement.
The east-facing building was completed in 1851 and initially served as a library and as a ballroom.
It was originally named Smith Hall after North Carolina Governor <a>General Benjamin Smith</a>, who was a special aide to <a>George Washington</a> during the <a>American Revolutionary War</a> and was an early benefactor to the university.
When the library moved to Hill Hall in 1907, the School of Law occupied Smith Hall until 1923.
In 1925, the structure was renovated and used as a stage by the university theater group, the Carolina Playmakers.
It has remained a theater to the present day.
<a>Louis Round Wilson</a> wrote in 1957 that Playmakers Theatre is the &quot;architectural gem of the campus.&quot;
Playmakers Theatre was declared a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> in 1973.
Today, the building is a venue for student drama productions, concerts, and events sponsored by academic departments.
In 2006, the university began a renovation of Playmakers Theatre, which has included an exterior paint job and interior remodeling.
The renovation is expected to be complete by the end of 2010.</p>

Minorities comprise 30.8% of UNC's undergraduate population and applications from international students have more than doubled in the last five years (from 702 in 2004 to 1,629 in 2009).
Eighty-nine percent of enrolling first year students in 2009 reported a GPA of 4.0 or higher on a weighted 4.0 scale.
UNC students are strong competitors for national and international scholarships.
In 2009, two UNC seniors won <a>Rhodes Scholarship</a>s.
The most popular majors at UNC are Biology, Business Administration, Psychology, Journalism and Mass Communication, and Political Science.
</p>
<p>At the undergraduate level, all students must fulfill a number of general education requirements as part of the Making Connections curriculum, which was introduced in 2006.
English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad <a>liberal arts</a> education.
The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen.
After their <a>sophomore</a> year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, nursing, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication.
Undergraduates are held to an eight-semester limit of study.
</p>
<h3>Honor code</h3>
<p>The university has a longstanding <a>honor code</a> known as the &quot;Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,&quot; supplemented by a student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community.
Faculty, Administration, and Athletics are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>[[File:2008-07-11 UNC-CH Wilson Library 1.jpg|thumb|right|Louis Round Wilson Library opened in 1929 and serves as the special collections library.]]
UNC's library system includes a number of individual libraries housed throughout the campus and holds more than 5.8&nbsp;million volumes in total.
The unparalleled assemblage of literary, visual, and artifactual materials documents four centuries of North Carolina history and culture.
The North Carolina Collection is housed in Wilson Library, named after <a>Louis Round Wilson</a>, along with the Rare Books Collection and the Southern Folklife Collection.
The university is home to <a>ibiblio</a>, one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies.
The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina.
The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located between the Pit area and Wilson Library.
It is named after Robert B. House, the Chancellor of UNC from 1945 to 1957, and it opened in 1968.
In 2001, the R.B. House Undergraduate Library underwent a $9.9 million renovation that modernized the furnishings, equipment, and infrastructure of the building.
Prior to the construction of Davis, Wilson Library was the university's main library, but now Wilson hosts special events and houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits.</p>

Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution.</p>
<h3>Scholarships</h3>
<p> [[Image:UNC Graham Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Graham
Memorial is adjacent to [[Franklin Street (Chapel Hill)|Franklin Street]] and houses the Office for Undergraduate Research and the Honors Study Abroad program.]]
For decades UNC has offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the <a>Morehead Scholarship</a> (currently named the Morehead&#x2013;Cain Scholarship).
Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years.
Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 29 alumni of the program have been named <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>.
North Carolina also boasts the <a>Robertson Scholars Program</a>, a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University.
Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina and Pogue Scholars programs, which offer full scholarships for out-of-state students.</p>
<p>In 2003, Chancellor <a>James Moeser</a> announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university.
The program was the second in the nation (following <a>Princeton</a>) and the first of its kind at a public university.
Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.
</p>
<p>North Carolina is tied for the largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (47 since 1902) with the <a>University of Virginia</a>.
Additionally, many students have won [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]], [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship|Goldwater]], [[Mitchell Scholarship|Mitchell]], [[Churchill Scholarship|Churchill]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]], [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]], [[Morris K.

The NCAA refers to UNC as the &quot;University of North Carolina&quot; for athletics.
As of Fall 2009, the university had won 37 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time.
These include twenty NCAA championships in <a>women's soccer</a>, six in <a>women's field hockey</a>, four in <a>men's lacrosse</a>, five in <a>men's basketball</a>, one in <a>women's basketball</a>, and one in men's soccer.
The Men's basketball team just won its 5th NCAA basketball championship in 2009, the second for Coach Roy Williams since he took the job as head coach.
Other recent successes include three consecutive <a>College World Series</a> appearances by the <a>baseball team</a> from 2006 to 2008.
In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the <a>Sears Directors Cup</a> &quot;all-sports national championship&quot; awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition.
Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include <a>Rachel Dawson</a> in field hockey; <a>Phil Ford</a>, <a>Tyler Hansbrough</a>, <a>Antawn Jamison</a>, <a>Vince Carter</a>, <a>James Worthy</a> and <a>Michael Jordan</a> in men's basketball; and <a>Mia Hamm</a> (twice), <a>Shannon Higgins</a>, <a>Kristine Lilly</a>, and <a>Tisha Venturini</a> in women's soccer.</p>
<h3>Mascot and nickname</h3>
<p>[[Image:Blue Devil and Rameses.jpg|right|thumb|Rameses at the 1957 [[Victory Bell (Carolina-Duke)|Victory Bell]] football game]] The university's teams are nicknamed the &quot;<a>Tar Heel</a>s,&quot; in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a <a>tar</a> and <a>pitch</a> producer.
The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the <a>American Civil War</a> and the <a>American Revolution</a>.
There is also an <a>anthropomorphic</a> ram mascot who appears at games.
The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a <a>United States Navy</a> flight training program that was attached to the university during <a>World War II</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Franklin Street Celebration.jpg|left|thumb|Celebration

<h3>Rivalries</h3>
<p> The <a>South's Oldest Rivalry</a> between North Carolina and its first opponent, the <a>University of Virginia</a>, was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century.
September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in <a>football</a> between the two teams.
The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with <a>Duke University</a>.
North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in <a>basketball</a>.
With a combined nine national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades.
As the two schools are located just eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their <a>Free Expression Tunnel</a> blue in 2006.
In retaliation, NC State students travel to <a>Chapel Hill</a> and paint campus landmarks red and a group has been found to be on UNC campus during the week of the yearly matchup between NC State and UNC's football teams playing the NC State fight song and alma mater.
After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to <a>Franklin Street</a>, which the police close to traffic.
People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires.</p>
<h3>School colors</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been <a>Carolina blue</a> and white.
The colors were chosen years before by the <a>Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies</a>, the oldest student organization at the university.
The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the &quot;Di&quot;s were from the western part of North Carolina while the &quot;Phi&quot;s were from the eastern part of the state.
Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation.
On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university.
When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the <a>UNC football</a> team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors.</p>
<h3>School songs</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are the university <a>fight song</a>s &quot;<a>I'm a Tar Heel Born</a>&quot; and &quot;<a>Here Comes Carolina</a>&quot;.
The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories.]]</p>
<h3>Organizations and activities</h3>
<p>Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university.
Funding is derived from the <a>student government</a> student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress.</p>
<p>The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the <a>North Carolina Children's Hospital</a>.
The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4&nbsp;million since its inception in 1999.</p>
<p>The student run newspaper <em><a>The Daily Tar Heel</a></em> is ranked highly by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>, and received the 2004&ndash;5 <a>National Pacemaker Award</a> from the <a>Associated Collegiate Press</a>.
Founded in 1977, <a>WXYC</a> 89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24&nbsp;hours a day, 365&nbsp;days a year.
Programming is left up to student DJs.
WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras.
On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet.
A student-run television station, <a>STV</a>, airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill <a>Time Warner Cable</a> system.</p>
<p>[[File:2008-07-11 UNC-CH Forest Theatre (top view).jpg|thumb|right|The
Forest Theatre was first used for outdoor drama in 1916 to celebrate the tercentenary of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] death.]]
The Residence Hall Association, the school's third-largest student-run organization, is dedicated to enhancing the experience of students living in residence halls.
This includes putting on social, educational, and philanthropic programs for residents; recognizing outstanding residents and members; and helping residents develop into successful leaders.
The organization is run by 8 student executive officers; 16 student governors that represent each residence hall community; and numerous community government members.
RHA is the campus organization of <a>NACURH</a>, the largest student organization in the world.
In 2010 the organization won the national RHA Building Block Award, which is awarded to the school with the most improved RHA organization.</p>
<p>[[File:UNC library flash mob rave.jpg|thumb|left|At the end of each semester, students organize a [[flash mob]] dance party in the library.]]
The athletic teams at the university are supported by the Marching Tar Heels, the university's <a>marching band</a>.
The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller <a>pep band</a>s play at all home basketball games.
Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports.
UNC has a <a>regional theater</a> company in residence, the <a>Playmakers Repertory Company</a>, and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus.
The school has an outdoor stone amphitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions.
Forest Theatre is dedicated to Professor Frederick Koch, the founder of the Carolina Playmakers and the father American folk drama.</p>
<p>Many <a>fraternities and sororities</a> on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and <a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a>.
As of spring 2010, eighteen percent of undergraduates were Greek (1146 men and 1693 women out of 17,160 total).
The total number of community service hours completed for the 2010 spring semester by fraternities and sororities was 51,819 hours (average of 31 hours/person).
UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school.
Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society.</p>
<p>Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court.
The Judicial Reform Committee created the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance, which outlined the current Honor Code and its means for enforcement in 1974.
Prior to that time, the <a>Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies</a> along with other campus organizations supported student concerns.</p>
<h3>Dining</h3>
<p>Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940.
The building was named for <a>General William Lenoir</a>, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790.
The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day.
It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop.</p>
<p>Rams Head Dining Center was opened to the students in March 2005.
It includes the Rams Head Dining Hall, Starbucks, and the Rams Head Market.
It was opened to offer more food service options to the students living on south campus.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>[[Image:Old East.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old
East|Old East residence hall]], built in 1793]] On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen &quot;communities,&quot; varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes <a>Old East</a>, the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002.
Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also &quot;living-learning communities&quot; which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs.
An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates on the basis of cultural or racial differences rather than similarities.
Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen.
Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are <a>smoke-free</a>.
As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.
