<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Qing Dynasty</h4>
<p>In 1897, Lin Qi (), the mayor of Hangzhou, established &quot;Qiushi Academy&quot; ().
Lin studied the western higher education system and applied it to Qiushi Academy, which would become one of the earliest new schools in modern China history.
1902, Qiushi Academy was renamed as Zhejiang Academy (&#x6d59;&#x6c5f;&#x5927;&#x5b78;&#x5802;/&#x6d59;&#x6c5f;&#x5927;&#x5b66;&#x5802;).
1903, its name was changed to Zhejiang Advanced College&#xff0c; established by Hongcheng's wife, panpan.
The &quot;Yuying Academy&quot; was also one of the Zhejiang University's early roots.
Yuying Academy was established in 1902 with its original name &quot;Yuying Xuetang&quot; (Xuetang means <em>school</em> or <em>college</em>), later &quot;Yuying Yishu&quot; (Yishu means <em>public school</em>), and then the academy.
1911, Yuying Academy was modified to Zhijiang Xutang, and moved to the Qinwang Hill (&#x79e6;&#x671b;&#x5c71;), a countryside of Hangzhou.</p>
<h4>1912-1937</h4>
<p>1912, the Zhejiang Medical School was established, later it developed to the Zhejiang Provincial Medical College.
This college became the medical college of Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>1927, some schools and colleges (e.g.
industrial and agricultural colleges/schools) were merged into the Qiushi Academy.
Then the name of the enlarged school was changed into &quot;National Third Sun Zhongshan University&quot; (or, National Third Sun Yat-sen University), for memorial of <a>Sun Yat-sen</a>.
April 1, 1928, it was called &quot;Chekiang University&quot; (or <a>Pinyin</a>: Zhejiang University), in the same year, &quot;National&quot; was added and it became &quot;National Chekiang University&quot; ().</p>
<h4>War Period, 1937-1949</h4>
<p>1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out.
Due to the attack from Japanese army, the university had to move out of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Reputed as &quot;<a>Cambridge</a> of the East&quot; by <a>Joseph Needham</a> (twice visited ZJU in 1944) in China's modern history of higher education, Zhejiang University's was consistently ranked as among top 3 in the nation during that time.</p>
<p>During this period, the National Zhejiang University was praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China (Chinese: &#x6c11;&#x56fd;&#x56db;&#x5927;&#x540d;&#x6821;), along with <a>National Central University</a>, <a>National Southwestern Associated University</a> and <a>National Wuhan University</a>.</p>
<h4>1952-1998</h4>
<p>Zhejiang University was split up into a number of single-discipline <a>college</a>s during the <a>1952</a> readjustment of China's Tertiary Education System.
Its schools of arts and sciences either went to form Hangzhou University or jointed with <a>Fudan University</a>.
Its medical and pharmaceutical schools formed Zhejiang Medical University.
Its agricultural and horticultural schools went to establish Zhejiang Agricultural University.</p>
<p>1952~1953, Its chemical engineering departments and some the other technological parts went to form the Hangzhou Chemical Engineering School (now <a>Zhejiang University of Technology</a>, ZJUT).
And the dean <a>Li Shouheng</a>, who was one of the main founders of China's modern chemical engineering, was pointed to be the first president of ZJUT.</p>
<h4>After 1998</h4>
<p>In 1998, with the approval of the <a>State Council</a>, the new Zhejiang University was established as a combination of four major universities that had grown up in <a>Hangzhou</a> over the previous half-century, namely Zhejiang University, <a>Hangzhou University</a>, Zhejiang Agricultural University and Zhejiang Medical University.</p>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<h4>Partnership with Simon Fraser University</h4>
<p>In 2006, Zhejiang University and <a>Simon Fraser University</a> started their Dual Degree Program in Computing Science.
The Program is divided into three parts, the Foundation Year, 2 Years Abroad, and the Upper division courses.
For the Foundation year, students will take Mandarin courses as well as introductory courses to Computing and Mathematics, then move to the other institution to study for two years, and then return to their respective institution for their upper division courses.</p>
<p>&quot;Dual degrees mean double the employment options after graduation, and two different teaching styles.&quot;--SFU

<h4>Partnership with Tufts University</h4>
<p>As an optional part of a comprehensive program for Chinese majors, third year Chinese majors at <a>Tufts University</a> can spend one semester of their year at Zhejiang University.
Most students stay at the <a>Yuquan Campus</a>, where the majority of foreign students are.</p>
<h4>Partnership with Loma Linda University</h4>
<p>Since before the founding of the prestigious <a>Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital</a>, Zhejiang University has been in cooperation with <a>Loma Linda University</a>.
After the hospital was built, Loma Linda assisted in bringing its management as well as research projects up-to-date while training many of its scholars and medical experts.
The hospital is now under management by Zhejiang University, while still accepting consultation from Loma Linda University.
There are still numerous ongoing training programs between Zhejiang University and Loma Linda University.</p>
<h4>Partnership with the University of Florida</h4>
<p>In July 2008, Zhejian University teamed up with the <a>University of Florida</a> to research sustainable solutions to the Earth's energy issues.
Overall a Joint Research Center of Clean Sustainable Energy among the Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy, at the University of Florida, and the State Key Lab of Clean Energy Utilization and the Institute for Thermal Power Engineering, at Zhejiang University will collaborate to work on this pressing issue.</p>
<h4>Partnership with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</h4>
<p>Zhejian University is involved in a close partnership with the <a>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a> in <a>Flanders</a>, Belgium </p>
