<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1906 by lawyer <a>Gleason Archer, Sr.</a>, Suffolk University was initially named <strong>Suffolk School of Law</strong>.
The school's goal was to &quot;serve ambitious young men who are obliged to work for a living while studying law.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1907, Archer moved the school from his <a>Roxbury, Massachusetts</a> home into his downtown <a>Boston</a> law offices.
A year later the first of Archer's students had passed the bar, leading to a boost in registration.</p>
