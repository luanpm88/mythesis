<p> <strong>Louisiana Tech University</strong>, often referred to as <strong>Louisiana Tech</strong> or <strong>LA Tech</strong>, is a <a>coeducation</a>al <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in <a>Ruston</a>, <a>Louisiana</a>.
Louisiana Tech is designated as a Tier 2 school in the national universities category by the 2011 <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> <a>college rankings</a>.
As a designated <a>space grant</a> college, member of the <a>Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities</a>, and <a>Carnegie</a> Research University with high research activity (RU/H), Louisiana Tech conducts research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as <a>NASA</a>, the <a>National Institutes of Health</a>, the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, and the <a>Department of Defense</a>.</p>
<p>In 1894 during the <a>Second Industrial Revolution</a>, the <a>General Assembly of Louisiana</a> established <strong>The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana</strong> to be located in Ruston.
Its original mission was to educate students in practical industries for the purpose of developing an <a>industrial economy</a> in post-<a>Reconstruction</a> Louisiana.
In 1898, the state constitution changed the school's name to <strong>Louisiana Industrial Institute</strong> and subsequently <strong>Louisiana Polytechnic Institute</strong> in 1921 to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and more capable <a>technical institute</a>.
Although unofficially called Louisiana Tech since the 1920s, the school's name was officially changed to Louisiana Tech University in 1970.</p>
<p>Louisiana Tech enrolled 11,289 students in 6 academic colleges for the 2009-10 academic year.

[<a>http://www.latech.edu/admissions/facts.shtml</a>]
Louisiana Tech operates on the quarter system while awarding semester hours: three quarters (fall, winter, spring) equal two semesters at other universities.
Louisiana Tech operates a satellite campus at <a>Barksdale Air Force Base</a> in <a>Bossier City</a>, and also maintains an <a>Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (ROTC) Detachment 305 [<a>http://www.latech.edu/tech/afrotc/</a>].
The university is known for its <a>engineering</a> programs and its <a>athletics</a>, especially <a>football</a> and <a>women's basketball</a>.</p>
<p>Louisiana Tech fields 16 varsity <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> sports teams (7 men's, 9 women's teams) and has been a member of the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a> since 2001.
The <a>Lady Techsters basketball</a> team has won three national championship titles (1981, 1982, 1988) and made 13 <a>Final Four</a> appearances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:Wyly Tower of Learning at LA Tech, Ruston, LA IMG 3766.JPG|200px|right|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;The Wyly Tower of Learning, named for graduates [[Charles Wyly|Charles]] and <a>Sam Wyly</a>, dominates the university landscape.&lt;/font
size=2&gt;]] <a>200px|right|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;Clock Tower in Centennial Plaza&lt;/font size=2&gt;</a></p>
<p>Before Louisiana Tech, there existed the private Ruston College, of which <a>Robert E. Russ</a>, the founder of Ruston, was a trustee.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1894, the Lincoln Parish Police Jury, the equivalent to the <a>county commission</a> in other states, held a special session to outline plans to secure an Industrial School for <a>Lincoln Parish</a>, pending in the next session of the <a>Louisiana State Legislature</a>.
The minutes of the special session, held on May 14, 1894, called upon <a>State Representative</a> <a>George M. Lomax</a>, and the state senator to secure a school for the parish.
When Lomax left <a>Ruston</a> for the legislative session, he carried with him the police jury resolution proposing a school.
Representative Lomax, <a>Jackson Parish</a> Representative J. T. M. Hancock, and <a>Judge</a> <a>John Burnham Holstead</a>, grandfather of later <a>State Representative</a> <a>George B. Holstead, Jr.</a>, fought for the passage of the bill.
After several weeks, it was approved as Act Number 68 of the General Assembly of Louisiana on July 6, 1894 [<a>http://books.google.com/books?id=pekXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false</a>].
Although Ruston was only ten years old, the thought of establishing a school there had come to fruition.
The act established a first class Industrial Institute and College in north Louisiana in the arts and sciences, which was given the name &quot;the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana to be located in Ruston, Louisiana.&quot;
Control of the school was entrusted to a board of trustees, which elected Colonel Arthur T. Prescott of <a>Baton Rouge</a> as the first president of the college.</p>
<p>Colonel Prescott quickly moved to Ruston and began overseeing the construction of a two-story main building.
The brick building housed eight large classrooms, an auditorium, a chemical laboratory, and two offices.
A frame building was also built nearby and was used for the instruction of mechanics.
The Main Building was located on a plot of twenty acres that was donated to the school by Francis P. Stubbs.
The original entrance to the campus was marked by four brick columns in front of the building.
On September 23, 1895, school was in session.
The Main Building, a.k.a.
Old Main, burned to the ground in 1936, but the columns that marked the entrance remain in place behind Prescott Memorial Library.
By June 1936, construction on a new administration building had begun.
On completion in January 1937, it was named Leche Hall in honor of then <a>Governor</a> <a>Richard W. Leche</a> of <a>New Orleans</a>.
The building was renamed after the death of former university president, <a>J.
E. Keeny</a>, and remains the remodeled Keeny Hall.</p>
<p>The first year, there were only six faculty members and 202 students from twenty-two parishes.
The Act states that students were to acquire &quot;academic and literary education, together with a knowledge of kindergarten instruction; of telegraphy, stenography, and phonography; of drawing, painting, designing and engraving in their industrial application; also a knowledge of fancy, practical and general needlework; also a knowledge of bookkeeping; and agricultural and mechanical art,&quot; as well as any other industry that would prepare the male and female students for the practical industries of the age.
Being the only state college in North Louisiana, admission requirements were lenient.
Applicants for admission to the general preparatory class were required to be 14 years old and be able to read, write, speak and spell with &quot;tolerable correctness.&quot;
The curriculum of the day consisted of required course work in the standard arts and sciences, as well as electives in technical subjects.
These included: the study of mechanics and industrial arts, domestic science, horticulture, bookkeeping, stenography, typewriting, telegraphy and printing.
By popular demand, music lessons in piano, voice and violin were later offered.
In May, 1897, Harry Howard became the first graduate.
Colonel Prescott awarded him with a Bachelor of Industry degree, but there was no formal commencement.
The first formal commencement was held in the Ruston Opera House the following May with 10 graduates receiving their diplomas.</p>
<p>Article 256 of the 1898 state constitution changed the school's name to Louisiana Industrial Institute [<a>http://books.google.com/books?id=97ESAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false</a>].
Two years later, the course of study was reorganized into two years of preparatory work and three years of college level courses.
Students who were high school graduates were admitted to the seventh quarter (college level) of study without examination.
As years went by, courses changed and admissions requirements tightened.
From 1917-1925, several curricula were organized according to the junior college standards and were offered as Bachelors of Industry.
In 1919, the Board of Trustees enlarged the curricula and started granting a standard baccalaureate degree.
The first of these was granted on June 15, 1921, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering.
The Constitution adopted June 18, 1921, changed the name of the school in Article XII, Section 9, from Louisiana Industrial Institute to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute [<a>http://books.google.com/books?id=mVMbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false</a>].
Although unofficially called Louisiana Tech since the 1920s, the moniker eventually stuck in 1970 when the school became known as what it is today, Louisiana Tech University.</p>
<p>The Class of 1905 established the annual yearbook, <em>Lagniappe</em>.
In 1959, four students were awarded the first master's degrees by the institution.
The first doctorate was awarded in 1971, a doctorate of philosophy in chemical engineering.
In 2007, Louisiana Tech became the first in the world to award a bachelor's of science in <a>nanosystems engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1894 Louisiana Tech has raised its admission requirements.
It became a &quot;selective admissions&quot; university in 1992.
Tech has one of the highest graduation and retention rates in the state.
As of May 2009, Louisiana Tech has awarded more than 87,700 degrees.</p>
<p>Louisiana Tech operates a satellite campus at <a>Barksdale Air Force Base</a> in <a>Bossier City</a>, and also maintains an <a>Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (ROTC) Detachment 305 [<a>http://www.latech.edu/tech/afrotc/</a>] on its main campus in Ruston, which works closely with Barksdale in Bossier City, <a>University of Louisiana Monroe</a>, <a>Northwestern State University</a>, and <a>historically black</a> <a>Grambling State University</a>.</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Lady of the Mist</a> </p>
<h3>Lady of the Mist</h3>
<p>In the midst of a fountain in the quadrangle, the Lady of the Mist is a landmark of the Louisiana Tech campus.
In 1938, the Lady was funded by the campus's young Panhellenic System - the sororities on campus.
The sculpture was specifically located to welcome all to the campus as through the columns that stand north of Prescott Memorial Library, which served as Tech's main entrance.
The statue was the idea of two Tech faculty members - Mary Moffett and Elizabeth Bethea.
The inscription on the Lady states that she symbolizes &quot;Alma Mater,&quot; welcoming new students and bidding farewell to graduates.
She symbolizes a hope that Tech graduates will fulfill their ambitions and their highest callings.
The statue later fell into disrepair but was reopened in 1985.[<a>http://www.latech.edu/fye/almamater.shtml</a>]</p>
