<p>Founded in 1876 at the <a>Toronto Normal School</a> by the Ontario Society of Artists, the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design was originally known as the Ontario School of Art.
In 1931, the school adopted the name Ontario College of Art.
The school changed its name to the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design in 1996.</p>
<p>After the institution became a degree-granting university, it announced that it was considering changing its name to prevent confusion with the term College.
On April 15, 2008, it was announced that the Board of Governors voted in favour of recommending that OCAD's name be changed from &quot;Ontario College of Art &amp; Design&quot; to &quot;OCAD University&quot;.
This name change was approved by the Ontario Government on June 4, 2010, and received <a>Royal Assent</a> on June 8, 2010.</p>
<p>OCADU is now officially the abbreviation for the school's name.
<em>OUAD</em> was considered, but was seen as &quot;unwieldy&quot;.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>In 1969-70, <a>Roy Ascott</a> radically challenged the pedagogy and curriculum structure of the College.</p>
<h3>Sharp Centre for Design</h3>
<p>In 2004 work was completed on a new expansion.
The &quot;Sharp Centre for Design&quot;, designed by architect <a>Will Alsop</a>, of Alsop Architects, in a joint venture with Toronto-based Robbie/Young + Wright Architects Inc.
It consists of a box four storeys off the ground supported by a series of multi-coloured pillars at different angles and is often described as a tabletop.
The $42.5 million expansion and redevelopment has received numerous awards, including the first-ever Royal Institute of British Architects Worldwide Award, the award of excellence in the &quot;Building in Context&quot; category at the Toronto Architecture and Urban Design Awards, and was deemed the most outstanding technical project overall in the 2005 Canadian Consulting Engineering Awards.</p>
