The first classes were held with 116 students.
It was renamed Southern Technical Institute in 1949 and moved to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia, around 1958.
It went through another name change in 1987 and was named Southern College of Technology.
Later in the summer of 1996, the university adopted its current name.

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>Founded in 1948 as a two-year division of the <a>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, SPSU was established at the request of Georgia's business and industry.
It first opened its doors as the <strong>Technical Institute</strong> in <a>Chamblee, Georgia</a>, with 116 students, all but 10 being <a>World War II</a> <a>veteran</a>s, and a staff of 12.
The <a>campus</a> was previously a part of <a>NAS Atlanta</a> (now <a>DeKalb-Peachtree Airport</a>), and the buildings used were formerly <a>barracks</a>.</p>
<p>In 1949, it became the <strong>Southern Technical Institute</strong> (<strong>STI</strong> or <strong>Southern Tech</strong>), and was recognized as a <a>college</a>-level school by the <a>U.S.
Department of Education</a>.
Less than a decade later (around 1958), the college migrated to its present campus in Marietta, which was previously part of <a>Dobbins Air Force Base</a>.
NAS Atlanta also moved to the opposite (south) end of Dobbins around the same time.</p>
<p>In 1961, <a>Hoyt McClure</a> was named acting director and led the movement to build eight new buildings on 120 acres (48 hectares) of land.
Since then SPSU has continued to expand&#x2014;the campus now encompasses more than 230 acres (92ha) and contains 35 buildings with continuing projects to expand the campus for both academia and student housing.</p>
<p>STI became <a>accredit</a>ed as a <a>four-year college</a> in 1970, and was one of the first colleges in the nation to offer the <a>bachelor</a> of <a>engineering technology</a> degree.
It also earned independence in the University System, separating ties with <a>Georgia Tech</a>.
In the summer of 1980, SPSU officially became the 14th senior college and the 33rd independent unit of the <a>University System of Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>The college's first president, Dr. Stephen R. Cheshier of <a>Purdue University</a>, was named in 1980 and served with distinction until his retirement as president in June 1997.
He saw SPSU through two name changes -- Southern College of Technology in 1987 and Southern Polytechnic State University in the summer of 1996, when the school also became a university.
Dr. Daniel S. Papp served as interim president from July of 1997 to August of 1998, when the university welcomed Dr. <a>Lisa Rossbacher</a>, formerly of <a>Dickinson College</a>, as its president.</p>

<h2>Students</h2>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>Student organizations such as fraternities, clubs, and the general student body are governed by the Student Government Association of Southern Polytechnic State University.
SGA is composed of elected and appointed undergraduate and graduate students.
The SGA is designed closely to the U.S. government, where the president has <a>veto</a> power, the vice president chairs the <a>legislative</a> body, and the chief judge has <a>judgment</a> authority over questions of constitutionality.
</p>
<p>The SGA is composed of three main branches: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Executive (President, Vice President, Secretary/Treasurer, Chief Judge, and four committee chairs)</li>
  <li>Legislative (Ten Councilmen including the four committee chairs, chaired by the VP and recorded by the Secretary/Treasurer)</li>
  <li>Judicial (Chief Judge and six Associate Judges)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Legislative Council divided into four committees.
These committees include Budget and Finance, Public Relations, Internal Affairs, and Elections.</p>
<h3>Student media</h3>
<h4>WGHR</h4>
<p><a>WGHR</a>, a noncommercial <a>college radio</a> <a>station</a>, served much of <a>Cobb County</a> in the northwest metro <a>Atlanta</a> area on <a>FM</a> from 1969 to 2004.
In 2002 the organization's staff applied for a new frequency from the <a>Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), but was subsequently denied.
The station now broadcasts solely via <a>webcast</a>.
The station is student- and listener-supported, with diverse and <a>eclectic</a> programming from a wide variety of <a>genre</a>s.</p>
<h4><em>The STING</em></h4>
<p>An <a>acronym</a> meaning <em>Southern Technical Institute News Gazette</em>.
The <a>student newspaper</a> has been publishing since the school was founded.
This media's slogan, in satire form, is &quot;Read By Tens Of People In One Country All Over The World&quot;.</p>
<h3>Student organizations</h3>
<h4>Academic competition teams</h4>
<p>SPSU fields a number of academic competition teams, including a robotics team.</p>

Over the years the SPSU teams have won various awards for their fully <a>autonomous</a> aerial robots.
Also, the Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Technology department sponsors a student-run Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) team that competes in an annual AUVSI underwater vehicle competition in San Diego, California.
The Civil Engineering Technology department sponsors the Steel Bridge team and the Concrete Canoe team, both of which compete in annual competitions on a regional and national level.</p>
<p>In 1992 the <a>Formula SAE</a> competition team was started by John M. Leverett, director of engineering at <a>Panoz Auto Development</a>.
The team has competed in numerous annual competitions since then, placing 20th in the 2007 competition.
The team is currently in the design process for a new car for the 2012 competition.</p>
