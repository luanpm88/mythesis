The central on-campus headquarters for KAOR Radio is the Al Neuharth Media Center while the transmitter lies atop Slagle Hall on USD's campus.</p>
<h3><em>The Volante</em></h3>
<p>The Volante has served as the campus newspaper since 1887.
It is published every Wednesday morning during the school year.
Managed entirely by students, <em>The Volante</em> prides itself as being editorially independent.</p>
<p>The paper has won numerous awards including a number of Best of Show and Pacemakers.
In October 2008 it was awarded its 7th Pacemaker Award, sometimes referred to as the Pulitzer Prize of College Journalism, by the Associated Collegiate Press.</p>
<p>The paper includes news, sports, opinion and verve (arts and entertainment) sections.
The paper also has a frequently updated website, which includes campus news, staff blogs and podcasts.
<em>The Volante</em> generally maintains a staff of 50 students.</p>

<p>The University is home to <strong>South Dakota Public Broadcasting</strong>, or <strong>SDPB</strong> for short.
It is a <a>network</a> of <a>PBS</a> television and <a>NPR</a> radio stations serving the state of <a>South Dakota</a>.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of South Dakota sponsors six sports for men (football, basketball, swimming &amp; diving, cross country, track &amp; field and golf) and nine sports for women (basketball, swimming &amp; diving, cross country, track &amp; field, golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball).
The school's athletic teams are called the &quot;Coyotes&quot; (pronounced Ki Yoat) and nicknamed the &quot;Yotes&quot; (Yoats).
The school colors are vermillion and white.
USD competes at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> level (Football Championship Subdivision in football) as a probationary transitional member, and is a member of the <a>Great West Conference</a> for all sports.
A majority of the sporting events at the University are held at the <a>DakotaDome</a>.
The school's homecoming, typically held in early October, is known as Dakota Days.</p>
<p>The Coyotes had long shared a spirited intrastate rivalry with the <a>South Dakota State Jackrabbits</a>, until 2004 when SDSU made the transition to Division I athletics.
Starting in the Fall of 2011, the two schools will resume regularly scheduled contests in most sports as the Coyotes will join the <a>Summit League</a> (SDSU became a member in the Summit League in 2007) and USD moves to the <a>Missouri Valley Football Conference</a> in 2012 (SDSU joined the MVFC in 2008).</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University of South Dakota is based on a  campus situated along the bluffs near the Missouri River in the southeast corner of the state.
The most prominent academic facility on campus, while simultaneously serving as one the school's symbols, is Old Main.
Old Main was built in 1883, burned down in 1889, and ultimately restored in 1997.
Along with several classrooms, it houses an Oscar Howe Museum, the University Honors Program, and Center for Academic Engagement.
Farber Hall, a 190-seat theatre utilized mainly for speaking engagements, is also located within Old Main.</p>
<p>One of the newest additions to the campus is the Al Neuharth Media Center, named for the founder of <em>USA Today</em>.
Dedicated in September 2003, the Neuharth Center houses all of the news and media organizations on campus, including the <a>Freedom Forum</a>&#x2019;s South Dakota operations, <a>South Dakota Public Broadcasting</a>, the Department of Contemporary Media and Journalism, campus newspaper <em>The Volante</em>, campus radio station KAOR, and television station KYOT.
Formerly an armory and athletic field house, the building was converted into a media center through donations made by Al Neuharth, a 1950 USD graduate.</p>
<p>The <a>DakotaDome</a> serves not only as the home venue for the school's football, softball, swimming,  basketball, volleyball, and track and field teams, but also a recreational center for the student body.
It is South Dakota's only domed football stadium, hosting the state's high school football championships in November.
</p>
<p>A $15 million, 61,000 square-foot wellness center is slated to open in the spring of 2011.
Located just north of the Warren M. Lee Center for the Fine Arts, the center will include state-of-the-art workout equipment, a multi-story climbing wall, multiple courts for basketball and volleyball, racquetball courts, and a three-lane walking/jogging track.</p>
<p>USD opened the doors to the newly constructed Theodore R. and Karen K. Muenster University Center (MUC) for student use February 17, 2009.
The MUC houses the Student Activities Center, a campus dining facility, coffee shop, book store, convenience store and a number of lounge and TV areas for students to relax or study.</p>
<p>USD's Beacom School of Business moved into a new building in the fall of 2009.
The previous building, Patterson Hall, is currently housing the sciences (Earth Science, Physics, Astronomy) until Akeley-Lawrence science building renovation is completed.</p>
<h2>Recognition</h2>
<p>For the 2006-07 academic year, the Beacom School of Business boasted graduating seniors who collectively scored in the top five percent in a national exit exam.</p>
<p>USD's Department of Political Science routinely attracts well-known speakers and produces students who garner top national awards such as the <a>Truman Scholarship</a>.
Four USD Political Science grads have been named <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>.</p>
