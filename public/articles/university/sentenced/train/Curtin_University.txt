It commenced operations with its current name in 2010, and was previously known as the Western Australian Institute of Technology (WAIT) before 1986, and Curtin University of Technology between 1986-2010.
Its current name is taken from the former <a>Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a>John Curtin</a>.</p>
<p>Curtin University is Western Australia's largest university with over 44,000 students, of which 8,495 study offshore (2009).
The university also has over 6,000 employees.</p>
<h2>Strengths and affiliations</h2>
<p>Curtin University is a highly research intensive institution and a member of <a>Australian Technology Network</a> (ATN Network).</p>
<p>Curtin has a growing reputation for research success in a number of areas including (but not limited to) Resources and Energy (e.g.
petroleum gas), Information and Communication, Health, Ageing and Well-being (Public Health), Communities and Changing Environments, and Growth and Prosperity.
It is the only Western Australian university to produce PhD recipients of the AINSE gold medal, the highest possible recognition for PhD level research excellence in Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>Curtin is also notable for its highly reputed and research driven Curtin Business School which is consistent in its rankings.
For instance, its Graduate School of Business was featured in The Economist worldwide MBA rankings in 2010 and was ranked 73rd out of 110 amongst renowned business schools worldwide.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Curtin has also diversified her profile in mainland China in recent years, with the Chinese government and industry involved in a number of business, management and research projects, particularly in supercomputing and minerals and petroleum.
This has coincided with  the increasing economic success of China's industry and the Chinese economy and the growing role of Western Australia as an important exporter of minerals and energy to China (notably iron ore, and petroleum gas exported as LNG - amongst the more significant mineral exports to China).
Enrolments of Chinese nationals in undergraduate and postgraduate and numbers of researchers originally from China working as Curtin staff have also increased.
The Chinese Premier <a>Wen Jiabao</a> chose to visit the <a>Woodside</a>-funded hydrocarbon research facility on its campus during his visit to Australia in 2005.</p>
<p>Curtin has also been selected as a partnering institution with <a>African Virtual University</a>, a <a>World Bank</a> project.
The project is delivered via four partner institutions:  <a>Addis Ababa University</a> (<a>Ethiopia</a>)  <a>Kigali Institute of Science &amp; Technology</a> (<a>Rwanda</a>)  <a>Kenyatta University</a> (<a>Kenya</a>)  <a>University of Dar es Salaam</a> (<a>Tanzania</a>).</p>
<p>Curtin has over 90 exchange partnerships with universities in more than 20 countries.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1985, Curtin University was called the Western Australian Institute of Technology (WAIT).
WAIT was formed in 1966.
Its nucleus comprised the tertiary programs formerly conducted in the <a>Perth Technical College</a> which opened in 1900.
In 1969, three more institutions were merged with WAIT: The <a>Western Australian School of Mines</a> (originally opened in 1902), the Muresk Agricultural College (dating from 1926) and schools of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in operation since the 1950s at <a>Shenton Park</a>.
However, on 7 November 2005, both institutions issued a press release that such a merger will not be undertaken.</p>
<p>In 2009 Curtin University became the first university in the Australian Technology Network to make it onto the Jiao Tong rankings of research universities.</p>
<p>To solidify a rapidly growing reputation in all areas from cultural diversity to the business sector, Curtin University dropped the &quot;of Technology&quot; suffix in 2010.</p>
<p>Postgraduate students are represented by <a>Curtin Student Guild Postgraduate Student Association</a>.
CUPSA is a department of the Guild.
Other departments include ISC (International Students Committee), Women&#x2019;s, Queer, Indigenous, and Part Time and Mature Age.
</p>
<p>Funding to the Curtin Student Guild has been greatly reduced when the <a>Voluntary Student Unionism</a> legislation came into force on 1 July 2006.
The Curtin Student Guild has already experienced State imposed <a>VSU</a> from 1994-2002.</p>
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>Curtin has its own Bus Port, connected to the <a>Transperth</a> Public Transport Network.
Many routes terminate/start at and run through this Port.
With the recent completion of the <a>Mandurah rail line</a>, it has become easier to travel to Curtin.
Students can alight at <a>Canning Bridge Station</a>, and then catch a bus, which goes directly to the university.</p>
<h2>Other campuses</h2>
<p>In addition to the main campus at Bentley, Curtin has two smaller campuses in the metropolitan area.
The Graduate School of Business is located in the Central Business District at 78 Murray Street in the renovated former Government Printing Office - a listed building on the State Register of Heritage Places, and listed in the National Trust's List of Classified Places.
The other campus is the Shenton Park Heath Research campus hosting NDRI (National Drug Research Institute).</p>
<p>The University Departments of Exploration Geophysics and Petroleum Engineering are located at the co-location research facilities of the Australia Resources Research Centre (<a>ARRC</a>) which also houses offices of two <a>CSIRO</a> divisions Petroleum Resources and Exploration and Mining), <a>BHP Billiton</a>, and National Measurement Institute.
The <a>ARRC</a> is located in the Technology Park, <a>Kensington</a>, which is adjacent to the main Bentley campus.
Some University staff, researchers and students on practicum work in other locations such as the Oral Health Centre of WA (<a>OHCWA</a>) in Nedlands  and at Royal Perth Hospital, amongst other organisations.</p>
<p>Curtin also has several campuses outside of Perth, notably those located in <a>Kalgoorlie</a> (Western Australia School of Mines), and <a>Northam</a> and <a>Collie</a> (<a>Muresk Institute</a>).
The first two campuses reflect the university's traditional strength in mine engineering and agriculture and resources (Muresk).
A number of micro-campuses exist in locations such as <a>Esperance</a>, <a>Margaret River</a> and <a>Geraldton</a>.
Nursing is the only course offered in Geraldton.</p>
<h3>Sydney campus</h3>
<p>The Sydney campus of Curtin University (Curtin Sydney) was established on 20 June 2005.
Initially, the campus was located in <a>The Rocks</a> area.
It was later relocated to the suburb of <a>Chippendale</a> where it occupies the historic <a>Berlei Building</a>.
Curtin Sydney offers foundation, diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate courses to students from all over the world.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>Curtin Sydney is located in the heart of the city near <a>Central Railway Station</a>, at 39 Regent Street, Chippendale.
