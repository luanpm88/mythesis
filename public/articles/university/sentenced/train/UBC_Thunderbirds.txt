<p>The <strong>UBC Thunderbirds</strong> are the athletic teams that represent the <a>University of British Columbia</a> in the <a>University Endowment Lands</a> just outside the city limits of <a>Vancouver</a>, <a>British Columbia</a>, <a>Canada</a>.
They are one of the most successful teams in the <a>CIS</a>, though a few of their teams are members of the <a>U.S.</a> <a>NAIA</a>.</p>
<h2>NCAA membership bid</h2>
<p>In 2005, they applied to become members of the principal U.S. college sports governing body, the <a>NCAA</a>.
They are not the first Canadian school to try to join the NCAA; in <a>2000</a>, local rival <a>Simon Fraser</a>, then exclusively an NAIA member, sought to join the NCAA but was turned down.
At the time, the NCAA's constitution prohibited non-U.S.
schools from joining; however, some observers believed the real reason Simon Fraser was turned down was that the school sought to join as a <a>Division II</a> school, and the NCAA did not want to set a precedent with a lower-level school.
UBC, on the other hand, was reportedly interested in joining <a>Division I</a>.
UBC's athletic budget of approximately $4 million <a>Canadian</a> is dwarfed by those of schools in the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>, the only <a>BCS conference</a> on the U.S. West Coast.
However, at least two <a>mid-major</a> conferences with a West Coast presence, the <a>West Coast Conference</a> and <a>Western Athletic Conference</a>, had been suggested as possible future homes for the Thunderbirds.</p>
<p>The NCAA approved a change to its constitution on January 14, 2008 to allow Canadian schools to become members.
Under a 10-year pilot program due to begin June 1, 2008, Canadian schools can join the NCAA as Division II members, and any school that meets the June 1 deadline for application can become a member as of the academic year immediately following the deadline.
CIS has not officially indicated whether a school joining the NCAA under this program can retain its CIS membership.
It was expected that both UBC and Simon Fraser would be among the first schools to apply for NCAA membership under this program.
Simon Fraser did apply and was accepted, but in April 2009 UBC deferred a decision on applying.</p>

<h2>Football </h2>
<p></p>
<p>The UBC Thunderbirds football team has won the <a>Hardy Trophy</a> conference championship 15 times, which is third all-time among competing teams.
On a national level, the team has won the <a>Vanier Cup</a> championship three times, in 1982, 1986 and, most recently, in 1997.
The team has also lost twice in the title game, in 1978 and 1987.
</p>
<p>The team has a long-standing rivalry with the cross-town <a>Simon Fraser Clan</a>.
While the two teams did not play within the same governing bodies until 2002 (SFU played in the <a>NAIA</a> while UBC has always competed in the <a>CIS</a>), they would compete in an annual match-up known as the Shrum Bowl, named after <a>Gordon Shrum</a>.
After SFU moved to <a>NCAA II</a>, it seemed as though the game would stop, however, it was announced that the two teams would play in October of 2010 at <a>Thunderbird Stadium</a> using <a>Canadian rules</a>.</p>

<h2>Baseball</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1996, 30 years after the original UBC baseball program was dismembered due to budget cuts, Athletic Director Bob Phillip along with former professional Jim Murphy and community baseball coach Mark Hiscott provided funding for the present day Thunderbirds baseball.
Hiscott recognized student Terry McKaig, a former collegiate player and national team member, as the one to take over the program as head coach.
Since 1997, McKaig has been the driving force behind the T-Birds with support and funding from such major leaguers as <a>Jeff Zimmerman</a> and <a>Ryan Dempster</a>.
</p>
<p>The Thunderbirds compete in the United States as the only Canadian member of the <a>National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA).
In 2001, the program reached a new level as the <a>New York Mets</a> made <a>Derran Watts</a> the first ever Thunderbird to be drafted, when they selected him in the <a>12th round</a>.
Since then nine more Thunderbirds have been drafted including <a>2007 World Series</a> starter <a>Jeff Francis</a>, who recently signed a contract worth close to $50 million.
T-bird baseball successes include their trip to the <a>2006 NAIA World Series</a>.</p>
<h2>Men's Ice Hockey</h2>
<p>In 1974, the members of the Thunderbirds hockey team travelled to <a>China</a> to help share hockey skills to with Chinese players.</p>
<h2>Men's Rugby</h2>
<p>Mens rugby is one of the oldest varsity sports at UBC (including the precursor to UBC, McGill University College of BC, varsity rugby started in 1906).
The varsity XV now competes against the University of Victoria in a two game, combined score series to claim the coveted &quot;Boot&quot;.
They also play a two game, combined score series against the University of California Berkeley (consistently the best university rugby team in the US) for the &quot;World Cup&quot; trophy (a competition started in 1921).
The  varsity XV is coached by Spence McTavish (former UBC varsity rugby captain, former Canadian rugby international and captain, and former Bobby Gaul award winner), and assistant coach Rod Holloway (former UBC varsity rugby scrumhalf, and former assistant coach of Canada's National Senior Men's team (RWC 1995)).
UBC's rugby program has a long tradition of producing national team rugby players (7's and 15's), most recently Jim Douglas (RWC 2003), <a>Mike Burak</a> (RWC 2007), and Chris Pack.
In the future, UBC's rugby program will have a chance to compete for a spot in the inaugural 2008 Canadian University Mens Rugby Championships in Markham, ON sponsored by Rugby Canada.</p>
