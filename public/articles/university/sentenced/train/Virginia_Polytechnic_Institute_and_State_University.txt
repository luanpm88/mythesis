<p> </p>
<p><strong>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</strong>, popularly known as <strong>Virginia Tech</strong> (<strong>VT</strong>), is a <a>land-grant</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Blacksburg, Virginia</a>, United States.</p>
<p>Founded in 1872 as an agricultural and mechanical land-grant college, Virginia Tech is a comprehensive, innovative research university with the largest full-time student population in Virginia and one of the few <a>public universities</a> in the United States that maintains a <a>corps of cadets</a>.
</p>
<p>The main Virginia Tech campus is located in the <a>New River Valley</a> in the <a>valley and ridge</a> physiographic region of the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a> in <a>southwestern</a> <a>Virginia</a>, a few miles from the <a>Jefferson National Forest</a> in <a>Montgomery County</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Virginia Tech's Burruss Hall.</a>In 1872, the <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> purchased the facilities of <a>Preston and Olin Institute</a>, a small <a>Methodist</a> school in rural <a>Montgomery County</a> with federal funds provided by the <a>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a>.
The Commonwealth incorporated a new institution on that site, a state-supported <a>land grant</a> <a>military institute</a> called the <strong>Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the 1891&ndash;1907 presidency of <a>John M. McBryde</a>, the school organized its academic programs into a traditional four-year college.
The evolution of the school's programs led to an 1896 name change to <strong>Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute</strong>.
The &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College&quot; portion of the name was popularly omitted almost immediately, and the name was officially changed to <strong>Virginia Polytechnic Institute</strong> in 1944.
During those years, there was a short-lived merger with <a>Radford University</a> which at the time was a women's college.
In 1923, VPI changed a policy of four-year compulsory participation in the <a>Corps of Cadets</a> to two years.
In <a>1931</a>, VPI began teaching classes at the <a>Norfolk Division</a> of the <a>College of William and Mary</a>.
This program eventually developed into a two-year engineering program after which students could transfer to VPI for their third and fourth year.</p>
<p>VPI President <a>T.
Marshall Hahn</a>, whose tenure ran from 1962 to 1974, was responsible for many of the successes that have shaped the modern institution of Virginia Tech.
His presidential agenda involved transitioning the school into a major research university.
To achieve this, the student body was increased by roughly 1,000 additional students per year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty were added (In 1966, for instance, the faculty added over 100 new professors) and research budgets were increased.
During the Hahn Presidency the University saw its first Rhodes Scholar in W.W. Lewis, class of 1963.
Hahn also ended the affiliation with <a>Radford University</a>, dropped the two-year Corps training requirement for its male students and allowed women to join the Corps.
Virginia Tech was the first school in the nation to open its corps of cadets to women.</p>
<p>One of Hahn's more controversial missions was only partially achieved.
He had visions of renaming the school from VPI to <strong>Virginia State University</strong>, reflecting the status it had achieved as a full-fledged research university.
As part of this move, VPI would have taken over control of the state's other land-grant institution, a <a>historically black college</a> in <a>Ettrick, Virginia</a>, south of <a>Richmond</a>, then called <strong>Virginia State College</strong>.
This plan failed to take root, and as a compromise, VPI added &quot;and State University&quot; to its name in 1970, yielding the current formal name of <strong>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</strong>.
In the late 1970s, the shorthand name &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; was adopted as the proper identification of the university's athletic teams over the acronym &quot;V.P.I.&quot; and the media were requested to use &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; in their reporting of sport scores.
In the early 1990s, the school authorized the official use of <strong>Virginia Tech</strong> as equivalent to the full VPI&amp;SU name.
Many school documents today use the shorter name, though diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name.
Similarly, the abbreviation <strong>VT</strong> is far more common today than VPI or VPI&amp;SU, and appears everywhere, from athletic uniforms, to the university's Internet domain name <em>vt.edu</em>.</p>
<p>In 2007, the school and campus received international attention as the site of the <a>Virginia Tech massacre</a>, which was the deadliest peacetime shooting incident by a single gunman in United States history, on or off of a school campus.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Virginia Tech offers 80 <a>bachelor's degree</a> programs and 140 master's and doctoral degree programs in eight colleges and two schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a></li>
  <li>College of Architecture and Urban Studies</li>
  <li>College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences</li>
  <li>Pamplin College of Business</li>
  <li>College of Engineering</li>
  <li>College of Natural Resources and Environment</li>
  <li>College of Science</li>
  <li>Myers Lawson School of Construction</li>
  <li><a>Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine</a></li>
  <li>Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>Admission to study at Virginia Tech has become increasingly selective.
For incoming freshman in the fall of 2010, undergraduate applications to the school totaled over 20,000 for a targeted incoming class size of 5,000 students.
Among accepted students, the average GPA was 3.96 and SAT was 1250.
Admission into many graduate programs is also highly competitive.
The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine received over 1,200 applications for an incoming class size of 42.</p>
<p>In addition to its academic colleges, Virginia Tech also has a university-wide honors program known as University Honors.
University Honors provides accepted honors students eleven different ways to earn honors credits towards one of the six honors degree options.
A small percentage of University Honors students are also invited to live in one of the two honors houses, the <a>Hillcrest Honors Community</a> and the Main Campbell Honors Community.
Honors students are required to maintain a 3.5 GPA in order to remain in the program.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech also features a unique laboratory with hundreds of computers in nearby off campus leased space which housed a discount store at one time.
Opened in 1997, this Math Emporium is used by 8,000 students in large enrollment math course from a variety of majors each semester.
11 Math courses have been redesigned to take advantage of the facility.
Results have been improved Math performance in students and reduced costs for staffing and space.</p>
<p>On January 3, 2007 Virginia Tech along with <a>Carilion Health System</a> announced the creation of a new private medical school and research institute that would be a joint venture between the two organizations.
The first medical school class began classes in August 2010, and the first wave of scientists were recruited to the research institute in September 2010.
The first medical school class has 42 students, making it a very small medical school.
The VTC School of Medicine and Research Institute is located in <a>Roanoke</a> next to the Carilion Health System hospital.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|One of the War Memorial Chapel pylons &quot;Sacrifice&quot; on a snowy day.</a>
<a>thumb|right|Torgersen Hall bridge over Alumni Mall.
Torgersen is an example of architecture using Hokie Stone.</a>
<a>thumb|right|Eggleston and Owens Halls.</a></p>
<p> The <a>Virginia Tech campus</a> is located in <a>Blacksburg, Virginia</a>.
The central campus is roughly bordered by Prices Fork Road to the northwest, Plantation Drive to the west, Main Street to the east, and US 460 Bypass to the south, though it has several thousand acres beyond the central campus.
The university has established branch <a>campus</a>es in <a>Hampton Roads</a> (<a>Virginia Beach</a>), the National Capital Region (Northern Virginia Center <a>Falls Church</a> and Urban Affairs &amp; Planning Program (Masters and Ph.D. in urban and regional planning) at its Old Town <a>Alexandria, Virginia</a>) campus, <a>Richmond</a>, <a>Roanoke</a>, and the Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center in <a>Abingdon</a>.</p>
<p>The Blacksburg campus is arranged rather uniquely in comparison to other universities.
In the center of campus lies the Drillfield, which is a large oval field running Northeast to Southwest, encircled by a one way street known as Drillfield Drive.
The Drillfield's name stems from its continuous use by the <a>Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets</a> to conduct military drills.
Two underground rivers underneath the drillfield cause it to gradually sink, making the land unsuitable for building and protecting it as an open space on campus.
On the northwestern side of the Drillfield lies the majority of the academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde halls.
On the southeastern side of the Drillfield lies the majority of the residential buildings, including the residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym.
Newman Library is located on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall.
North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus.
The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets' barracks and Shultz Dining center.</p>
<p>On the Blacksburg campus, the majority of the buildings incorporate <a>Hokie Stone</a> as building material.
In fact, it is now official university policy that all new buildings must incorporate the stone into their design.
Hokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink.
The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama - one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s.
However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions.
For example, all buildings in the Upper Quad, which includes Lane and Shultz Halls, are constructed of red brick.
Also, a number of academic buildings were not constructed using Hokie Stone, as they were built before the institution of the rule mandating its use in all new university buildings.</p>
<p>In 2007 and 2009, Virginia Tech was ranked #1 by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> under the category of &quot;Best Campus Food&quot;.
It has seven dining centers which included Squires food court (<a>Au Bon Pain</a> &amp; <a>Sbarro</a>), Owens Food Court, Hokie Grill (<a>Chick-fil-A</a>, <a>Pizza Hut</a>, <a>Cinnabon</a>, <a>Carvel Ice Cream</a>), D2 &amp; DXpress, Shultz &amp; Shultz Express, Deet's Place, and the high end West End Market.
Virginia Tech also has a catering center, Personal Touch Catering.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Stylized &quot;VT&quot; logo</a>Virginia Tech's sports teams are called the <a>Hokies</a>, except for the swim team which uses a variant (&quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Okies&quot;).
Tech teams participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> in the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a>, which the school joined in 2004 after leaving the <a>Big East</a>.
Along with all other ACC schools, Tech's <a>football</a> team competes in <a>Division I FBS</a>, the higher of two levels of Division I competition in that sport.</p>
<p>The <a>Hokie Bird</a> is a <a>turkey</a>-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the <a>Fighting Gobbler</a>.
While the modern Hokie Bird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word &quot;Hokie&quot; has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use.
The term originated from the <em><a>Old Hokie</a></em> spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word.</p>
<p>The stylized <strong>VT</strong> (the abbreviation for <strong>Virginia Tech</strong>) is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams.
The &quot;athletic VT&quot; symbol is <a>trademark</a>ed by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.</p>
<p>During the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and <a>Virginia Military Institute</a>.
This rivalry developed into the original &quot;Military Classic of the South,&quot; an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on <a>Thanksgiving Day</a> in <a>Roanoke, Virginia</a>.
That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the <a>Division I-AA</a> level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA's 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools' wide disparity in size had led to a similar imbalance in results.
Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the <a>University of Virginia</a>.
The <a>Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry</a> strengthened in concurrence with both UVA's and Tech's growth during the 1960s and 1970s and this is now the Hokies' primary program-wide athletic rivalry.
The two schools compete in football for the Governor's &quot;Commonwealth Cup&quot; each season.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech's <a>fight song</a>, <em><a>Tech Triumph</a></em>, was written in 1919 and remains in use today.
<em>Tech Triumph</em> is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech band, <a>The Marching Virginians</a>, and the Corps of Cadets' band, the <a>Highty Tighties</a>.
The <em><a>Old Hokie</a></em> spirit yell, written in 1896 and used to this day, is familiar to many Virginia Tech fans.
This chant is also where the word Hoki (since modified to &quot;Hokie&quot;) originally appeared.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech baseball</h3>
<p><a>Chuck Hartman</a>, who retired as the Virginia Tech <a>baseball</a> coach in 2006, finished his career as the fourth winningest coach in Division I baseball history with a 1,444-816-8 record, including a 961-591-18 mark in his 28 seasons at Tech, the best record of any baseball coach in history at Tech.
Peter Hughes from Boston College is now the new coach for Virginia Tech.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech basketball (men's)</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Virginia Tech's Cassell Coliseum</a></p>
<p>Virginia Tech's men's <a>basketball</a> team has seen a resurgence of fan support since the arrival of coach <a>Seth Greenberg</a> in 2003-04 and its entry into the <a>ACC</a> in 2004-05.
Prior to Coach Greenberg's arrival in Blacksburg, the Virginia Tech men had not had a winning season since the 1995&ndash;1996 season when they received a bid to the <a>NCAA tournament</a>, and the team did not even make the <a>Big East</a> tournament its first three seasons in the conference.
Greenberg's squad finally made the Big East tournament in 2003-04, then a year later scored their first postseason berth in nine years when they made the <a>NIT</a> in 2004-05 as a first-year ACC school.
In the <a>2006-07 season</a>, Greenberg's Hokies finished with a 10&ndash;6 record in the ACC and 22-12 record overall, earning its first NCAA tournament berth in 11 years, and reaching the NCAA second round before losing to <a>Southern Illinois</a>.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech basketball (women's)</h3>
<p>Virginia Tech's women's basketball team, led by coach <a>Beth Dunkenberger</a>, is a fixture in postseason play, having received a berth to the <a>NCAA tournament</a> each season from 2003 to 2006.
Virginia Tech's women have been in postseason play every year since the 1997-98 season, <a>Bonnie Henrickson</a>'s first season as the head coach of the Hokies, earning seven NCAA berths and three <a>NIT</a> appearances during that stretch.</p>
<p>Both basketball teams play their home games in <a>Cassell Coliseum</a>.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech football</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|right|Lane Stadium from the north in June 2008.</a>
Virginia Tech's football team plays home games in <a>Lane Stadium</a>.
Having a capacity of 66,233, it is relatively small in comparison to many other top Division I-A stadiums, yet it is still considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country.
In 2005, it was recognized by <a>rivals.com</a>
as having the best home field advantage in college football.</p>
<p>Head coach <a>Frank Beamer</a> has become one of the winningest currently active head coaches in Division I-A football with 198 wins following the <a>2006 season</a>.
Beamer's teams are known for solid <a>special teams</a> play (affectionately called Beamer Ball) and for tough defenses headed by defensive coordinator <a>Bud Foster</a>.
The Hokies currently have the fourth longest bowl streak in the country, having participated in bowl games in each of the last 16 seasons.
Since the 1995 season, the Hokies have finished with a top-10 ranking five times, won seven conference championships (three <a>Big East</a> and four <a>ACC</a>), and played once for the national championship, losing to <a>Florida State</a> 46&ndash;29 in the <a>2000 Sugar Bowl</a>.
Currently Virginia Tech is the only team to have 7 straight 10-win seasons in Division I-A football.
Annually, Virginia Tech plays its traditional rival, the <a>University of Virginia</a>, for the <a>Commonwealth Cup</a>.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech soccer (men's)</h3>
<p>Virginia Tech's men's soccer team has improved greatly since the arrival of Oliver Weiss, who has coached the team since 2000.
Under Weiss, Tech has made four NCAA tournament appearances, including a trip to the <a>College Cup</a> in 2007.
The Hokie's trip to the College Cup is the equivalent of men's basketball <a>Final Four</a> and was the soccer team's most successful season.
The Hokies finished the 2007 regular season ranked third nationally.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech soccer (women's)</h3>
<p>Women's soccer at Virginia Tech began in 1980 with two club teams under the guidance of Everett Germain and his two daughters, Betsy and Julie.
Women's soccer has made great strides over the years and continues to be very successful.</p>
<h3>Virginia Tech softball</h3>
<p>Virginia Tech Softball made a name for itself by no hitting team USA in 2008 and advancing to the Women's College World Series for the first time ever.
Since then the organization hasn't had a winning season but looks to improve with a new coach at the start of the 2011 season</p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p><strong>Tech Triumph</strong> is the <a>fight song</a> of <a>Virginia Tech</a>.
It was composed in 1919 by Wilfred Pete Maddux (class of 1920) and Mattie Eppes (Boggs).
Wilfred Preston (&quot;Pete&quot;) Maddux, a trombone and baritone player in the <a>Virginia Tech Regimental Band</a> (member of the band from the Fall of 1917 to 1919), jointly composed <em><a>Tech Triumph</a></em> <a>(1985 recording - link updated 2008)</a> in 1919 along with Mattie Walton Eppes (Boggs).
Mattie Eppes was a neighbor of Pete in his hometown of <a>Blacksburg, Virginia</a>.
When he was home, Pete would often play violin with Mattie accompanying him on the piano.
One evening in the summer of 1919, Pete asked her to help him compose a fight song for VPI.
She played the tune and Pete wrote out the score and the words for two verses in a single evening.
Pete Maddox is not listed in the yearbook with the band after 1919.
Ms. Eppes later married John C. Boggs, Superintendent of <a>Randolph-Macon Military Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The song was first performed on Saturday, November 1, 1919, at the Fair Grounds in <a>Lynchburg, Virginia</a> before the football game between <a>V.P.I.</a> and <a>Washington and Lee University</a>.
According to the report in the November 5, 1919, issue of The Virginia Tech, there were problems with obtaining uniforms for the entire Corps, so only the junior and senior classes, along with the band, were able to attend the game.
The cadets arrived by train in Lynchburg at 11:30 a.m. and headed to the Carroll Hotel, which was V.P.I. headquarters.
At 1 p.m., the cadets paraded through the streets of Lynchburg, then headed to the car barn to board street cars for the trip to the Fair Grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;On arriving at the grounds, the battalion was formed for the review on the football field.
After passing in review before the grandstand, the four companies formed a hollow square with the band in the center, and the band played our new song, 'Tech Triumph.'&quot;</p>
<p>The following school year, as noted in the June 2, 1920, edition of <em>The Virginia Tech</em>, &quot;After a great deal of trouble, to say nothing of the expense incurred, the Monogram Club has succeeded in placing the &quot;Tech Triumph&quot; upon a <a>Columbia record</a>, and we are told that the greatest college song on &quot;record&quot; will be out during Finals.&quot;</p>
<p>The popularity of the song continued, as reported in the November 3, 1920, edition of The Virginia Tech.
&quot;The song has been a great success, not only as a school song, but also as a popular selection, and is featured as such by many dance orchestras.
J. N. Walker, who has been handling the sale of the records and piano copies for the Monogram Club, has received another supply of both the records and the sheet music, which are now on sale at 256 G Division.
The price remains the same as formerly, $1.25 for the record and 35 cents for the piano copies.
Anyone who has failed to obtain either the record or the sheet music is urged to do so at once, as the supply is not expected to last long.&quot;</p>
<h2>Corps of Cadets</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|100 px|The VTCC Crest</a>  The <strong>Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets</strong> (<strong>VTCC</strong>) is one of only two military organizations established as an integral part of a major United States civilian, public <a>university</a>; the other is <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>.
Both are <a>Senior Military College</a>s.
The Corps of Cadets has existed from the founding the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872 and enrollment in the program was mandatory until 1964, when Virginia Tech first began allowing students to follow a strictly civilian track.
The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets has produced seven Medal of Honor recipients.&lt;!--A&amp;M also has 7, but Harvard has ten, see the Wall Street Journal, November 3, 2009, Pg. 19, Harvard's Medals Of Honor by William McGurn--&gt;  Cadets live together in dormitories, march to meals in formation, wear a distinctive uniform on campus, and receive an intensive military and leadership educational experience similar to that available at the <a>United States military academies</a>.
Unlike the US service academies, however, VTCC cadets are not required to engage in compulsory military service upon graduation, with as many as 20% of cadets in any given year electing to pursue a civilian career upon graduation.</p>
<h2>Affiliated institutions</h2>
<h3>Domestic affiliations</h3>
<h4>Edward Via Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine</h4>
<p> In 2003, Virginia Tech and the Harvey W. Peters Research Foundation worked together to start up a new private school of <a>osteopathic medicine</a> called the Edward Via <strong>Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine</strong> (VCOM).
VCOM opened in the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center, an office park adjacent to and owned and operated by the university as a local business incubator.
VCOM is incorporated as a private, non-profit institution with no state interest, but it is very closely affiliated with Virginia Tech on an operational level.</p>
<h4>School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences</h4>
<p>In 2002, a biomedical engineering program, called the School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (SBES), was created as a cooperative venture between Virginia Tech and <a>Wake Forest University</a>.
SBES offers opportunities to undergraduates and grants M.S. and <a>Ph.D.</a> degrees in <a>biomedical engineering</a>.</p>
<h4>Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine</h4>
<p> The Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, founded in 1978, is a separate institution on the same campus, funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland and jointly operated by VT and the <a>University of Maryland</a>.
VMRCVM and VT jointly operate an equine center in <a>Leesburg, Virginia</a>, and VMRCVM has a small operation on the University of Maryland's <a>College Park, Maryland</a> campus.</p>
<h4>Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</h4>
<p>The <a>Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</a> (VBI) is a premier <a>bioinformatics</a>, <a>computational biology</a>, and <a>systems biology</a> research facility that opened on the Blacksburg campus of <a>Virginia Tech</a> in 2000.
It houses over two-hundred employees, multiple supercomputing clusters, and several DNA sequencers, including a massively-parallel high-throughput <a>Roche</a> GS-FLXsequencer.
VBI is dedicated to the study of the biological sciences.
The research platform of VBI focuses on the &quot;disease triangle&quot; of host-pathogen-environment interactions.
By using <a>bioinformatics</a>, which combines transdisciplinary approaches to information technology and biology, researchers at VBI interpret and apply vast amounts of biological data generated from basic research to some of today&#x300f;s key challenges in the <a>biomedical</a>, <a>environmental</a> and <a>agricultural sciences</a>.
Work at VBI involves collaboration in diverse disciplines such as <a>mathematics</a>, <a>epidemiology</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>biology</a>, <a>plant pathology</a>, <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>systems biology</a>, <a>statistics</a>, <a>economics</a> and <a>synthetic biology</a>.
