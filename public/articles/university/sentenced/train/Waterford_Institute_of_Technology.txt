<p><strong>Waterford Institute of Technology</strong> () (<strong>WIT</strong>) is a state funded  <a>third-level</a> educational institution situated in the city of <a>Waterford</a>, <a>Ireland</a>.
The Institute has six Schools and 16 Departments.</p>
<p>The institute opened in 1970 as a <a>Regional Technical College</a> and adopted its present name on May 7, 1997.
Professor Kieran Byrne has been Director of the Institute since May 2001.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> At the time of the founding of the RTC, there were two other third-level level institutions in the city, St John&#x2019;s Seminary  Waterford News and Star which notes the closing of the St John's Seminary in 1999 and De La Salle Brothers teacher training college, but both had been closed.</p>
<p>Waterford politicians made strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to locate a university in Waterford at the time of the formation of the <a>Queen's University of Ireland</a> in the 1840s.
The cause was led by <a>Thomas Wyse</a>, Waterford&#x2019;s then <a>Member of Parliament</a>, who was perhaps chosen unwisely as he was not influential in Parliament, having strong Napoleonic links (he married a niece of <a>Napoleon I</a> of France), being a Catholic and leaning towards an independent Ireland.
<a>Galway</a>, a much smaller city at the time, won out over Waterford, perhaps because of the necessity for geographical dispersion or to bolster the <a>Irish language</a>.
Wyse wrote in the round on the matter in his text &quot;Education reform or the necessity of a national system of education&quot; (London, 1836).</p>
<p>The institute was founded in 1970 as <strong>Regional Technical College, Waterford</strong>.
Once founded, the regional technical college grew very quickly as a result of the obviously strong regional need for tertiary education.
In 1997 the college adopted its present name by order of the Minister for Education <a>Niamh Bhreathnach</a>, with <a>Dublin Institute of Technology</a> being the only other institution with the &quot;institute of technology&quot; title at the time in Ireland.
Following a change of government and enormous political pressure on behalf of other regional technical colleges, especially <a>Cork Regional Technical College</a>, all other regional technical colleges were renamed similarly by Minister for Education <a>Miche&#x00e1;l Martin</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2001 Institute has conferred its own awards at all levels from Higher Certificate to PhD, subject to standards set and monitored by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (<a>HETAC</a>) which was established by the Government in June 2001, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.
In October 2005 the institute was selected by <a>The Sunday Times</a> newspaper as the &quot;Institute of Technology of the Year&quot; in Ireland.</p>
<p>The institute now has a student population of approximately 6000 full-time students and 3500 part-time students.
The Staff currently consists of approximately 470 Full-time academic, 300 part-time and 300 support staff.</p>
<p>The institute formally applied in 2006 for university status in accordance with the Universities Act, 1997, and the process of examining the case for redesignation has commenced.
In January 2007 Dr Jim Port was engaged by the government to carry out a &quot;preliminary assessment&quot; of the institute's case.
Waterford is Ireland's largest population centre (and only city) without a university.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The Institute has 4 campuses: Cork Road, College Street, West Campus (Carriganore) and the Applied Technology Building.</p>
<h3>Main Campus</h3>
<p>The main campus is located on the N25 Cork Road.
It was established in 1970 and houses the majority of the institutes departments.
The Engineering, Science, Business and Health Science Schools are located on this campus.
The buildings on this campus are: The original &#x2019;69 building, the &#x2019;77 extension, Luke Wadding library, IT Building, Nursing Building, College Hall, Tourism and Leisure Building, &#x201c;T-Block&#x201d;.
In late 2005 the Minister for Education and Science <a>Mary Hannafin</a> announced four new buildings (an Engineering &amp; Science Building, an Architecture Building, a Business &amp; Enterprise Building and a Tourism &amp; Leisure Building) as part of a &#x20ac;1.2
billion investment in higher education.
It is unsure how many of these will be located on this campus.
The Tourism &amp; Leisure Building was located here.</p>
<h3>College Street Campus</h3>
<p>The College Street Campus is the second largest campus currently.
The buildings were purchased from the Good Shepherd Order of Nuns.
The once convent houses a beautiful <a>Pugin</a>-designed chapel which is used for concerts and ceremonies.
The Humanities and Education schools are officially located here, but are in reality spread between this and the main campus, and the College Street Library.</p>
<h3>Carriganore Campus</h3>
<p>The Carriganore campus, or West Campus, is located outside the city near the Waterford Bypass.
It is the goal of the Institute that this campus become the colleges main campus in years to come.
So far it has the Arclabs Research and Innovation Centre, the National Biodiversity Centre, Carriganore House (an old mansion now providing office and meeting space).
New sports facilities are about to be finished, and the construction of a new postgraduate and postdoctoral research building has started in December 2009.</p>
<h3>Applied Technology Building</h3>
<p>The Applied Technology Building, which is on lease from IDA Ireland, is located in Waterford&#x2019;s Industrial Estate.
This is just a 2 minute walk from the back of the main campus.
While thought by most students to be a &#x201c;spill-over&#x201d; of the main campus, due to its close proximity, it is officially a separate campus.
It houses engineering workshops and technology based facilities as well as the Careers Centre and the Engineering Research area.</p>
