<p> <strong>&#x00d6;rebro University</strong> () is a state <a>university</a> in <a>&#x00d6;rebro</a>, <a>Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>University-level education in &#x00d6;rebro started in 1960s, when <a>Uppsala University</a> started to give some courses in &#x00d6;rebro.
On the basis of these activities, an independent <a>h&#x00f6;gskola</a> (<a>university college</a>) was created in 1977 under the name <em>H&#x00f6;gskolan i &#x00d6;rebro</em> (&#x00d6;rebro University College).
This university college also incorporated three other existing educational institutions in &#x00d6;rebro: the teaching seminar, the sports college (founded in 1966) and the social work college (founded 1967).
This college was granted the privileges of a university by the <a>Government of Sweden</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>On March the 30th 2010 the university was granted the right to award medical degrees in collaboration with <a>&#x00d6;rebro University Hospital</a>, making it the 7th medical school in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p>Among former students may be noted the former manager of the English national football team <a>Sven-G&#x00f6;ran Eriksson</a> and former Swedish Prime Minister <a>G&#x00f6;ran Persson</a>.</p>
<p>Persson, who studied <a>sociology</a> in &#x00d6;rebro 1969-1971,  was awarded an <a>honorary doctorate</a> in medicine from the university in early 2005.
This caused criticism both from within &#x00d6;rebro University itself and from representatives of other Swedish universities.</p>
