<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Technology, Sydney</strong> (<strong>UTS</strong>), is a <a>university</a> in <a>Sydney</a>, <a>New South Wales</a>, <a>Australia</a>.
The university was founded in its current form in 1988, although its origins trace back to the 1870s.
UTS is notable for its central location as the only university with its main campuses within the <a>Sydney CBD</a>.
It is part of the <a>Australian Technology Network</a> of universities and has the fifth largest enrolment in Sydney.
UTS has been ranked 234&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; in the World's Top 500 universities by the <a>Times HES</a> (2008) and was one of two Australian Universities given A1 ratings across all major disciplines in 2007 and 2008 by the <a>Federal Government Education department</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The present day University of Technology originates from the <strong>Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts</strong> (the oldest Mechanics' Institute in Australia).
In the 1870s the SMSA formed the <strong>Workingman's College</strong> which was later taken over by the NSW government to form, in 1878, the <strong>Sydney Technical College</strong>.
In 1969, part of the Sydney Technical College became the <strong>New South Wales Institute of Technology</strong> (NSWIT).
It was officially unveiled by <a>Neville Wran</a>.</p>
<p>It was reconstituted as the <strong>University of Technology, Sydney</strong> (UTS), in 1988 under an Act of NSW State Parliament.
In 1990 it absorbed the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education and the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education of the Sydney College of Advanced Education, under the terms of the Higher Education (Amalgamation) Act 1989.</p>
<p>Although its antecedent institutions go back as far as 1893, they took new shapes from the 1960s, creating a new University focused on practice-oriented education with strong links to industry, the professions and the community, and with a growing research reputation and a strong commitment to internationalisation.</p>
<p>UTS has had three phases in its history.
In the first phase, effort was concentrated on embedding an amalgamation of institutions which were culturally and structurally different.
This strengthened the research culture and established a more consistent approach to teaching and learning.: [[Image:Ultimo UTS Tower.JPG|thumb|right|The [[UTS Tower|Tower building]] is the tallest educational facility in Australia with 32 levels]] </p>

<h2>Reputation and Achievements</h2>
<p><img> <img></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each year UTS attracts the highest number of first preference applications for Creative Arts courses in the state.
These courses include the <a>Bachelor of Design</a> courses offered by the Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building and the <a>Bachelor of Arts (Communications)</a> courses offered by the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.
</li>
  <li>In December 2006 the UTS Faculty of Business earned accreditation from <a>AACSB</a> International.
To contextualise this there are only 5 institutions that have received this accreditation in Australia, and just 540 worldwide (less than 10 per cent of the world's business schools).
This comes on the back of being ranked in the top six business/economics faculties for the DEST Learning and Teaching Performance Fund (2007).</li>
<li>At the end of 2007 UTS became the first undergraduate <a>CFA</a> (<a>Chartered Financial Analyst</a>) Program Partner in Australia based on the Bachelor of Business with a major in Finance.
The UTS Finance major is still the only undergraduate degree in Australia to be acknowledged by the CFA.</li>
  <li>In October 2007 UTS received the equal highest allocation of the &quot;Learning and Teaching Performance Fund&quot; alongside the University of Wollongong.
The university received an A1 rating for all four discipline groupings (science, business, humanities and health).</li>
</ul>
<p><img></p>
<ul>
  <li>UTS has earned an <a>EOWA</a> (Employer of Choice for Women) citation every year since it was launched in 2001, and has been rated as a best practice organisation by EOWA for the past ten years.</li>
<li>The Australian Graduate Survey results (2007) showed that 90% of Graduate School of Business graduates secure employment three months after graduating with an average starting salary of over $80,000 while the average salary for undergraduates were $50,760.</li>
<li>In 2008 UTS received the equal highest allocation of the &quot;Learning and Teaching Performance Fund&quot;.
The university received the highest rating for all four discipline groupings (science, business, humanities and health).</li>
<li>University of Technology, Sydney was listed as one of 39 <a>World's Best Design Programs</a> under programs to watch, selected by <a>Business Week</a>, alongside other reputable institutions such as <a>Parsons The New School for Design</a> and <a>University of Tokyo</a>.
UTS was the only Australian institution to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Campus architecture</h3>
<p>The University of Technology, Sydney is an interesting mix of architectural styles reflecting the different periods in which the buildings and grounds were constructed and renovated.
The famous <a>'Tower' building</a> is an example of <a>brutalist architecture</a> with square and block concrete designs.
Built following massive student protests in U.S. colleges like Berkeley and Kent State University, the building was designed to do away with large, outdoor areas and hence limit students' ability to stage large protests.
The Haymarket campus (building 5) combines a modern interior with the remaining exterior of the old markets building, and the recently completed buildings 4 and 6 are designed with an element of <a>high-tech architecture</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In October 2006, the university's tower building was voted by 23% of the total vote in a poll hosted by <a>Sydney Morning Herald</a> as ugliest building in Sydney.</p>
<p>The University recently acquired the former <a>Sydney Institute of Technology</a> building that stands opposite to Building 10 (on Jones St) and adjacent to Building 2. This building was named Building 7, but was demolished to make way for an extension of Alumni Green.
Currently, the university is constructing an underground multi-purpose sports hall beside the Alumni Green.
This project commenced in late January 2010 and is slated for completion December 2010.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>UTS provides services through two campus Libraries, the City Campus (Blake Library) and the Kuring-gai Campus (George Muir Library) as well as an extensive range of online services <a>www.lib.uts.edu.au</a>.</p>
<p>UTS Library staff provide assignment and research assistance in both Libraries, online and through outreach programs directly to the different discipline areas.
In addition, Library staff manage all loans, including interlibrary loans and the technical aspects of running a large research and teaching and learning Library.</p>
<p>UTS Library is responsible for UTSeScholarship , providing a secure, stable, digital home for the scholarly output of the University's staff, students and research community.
UTSeScholarship encompasses three distinct areas: UTSePress, UTSiResearch and UTSeData.</p>
<p>UTSePress publishes scholarly books, conference proceedings and journals.
The titles published are peer reviewed, compliant with current academic publishing regulations and growing in reputation and impact.</p>
<p>UTSiResearch captures, stores, indexes, preserves and redistributes the University's scholarly research in digital formats.</p>
<p>UTSeData manages data curation.
We are the national node for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive (ATSIDA) and the NSW node for the Australian Social Sciences Data Archive  - a collaborative venture across Australian institutions.</p>
<p>UTSeData also provides advice regarding data curation for other disciplines.</p>
<p>The Blake Library (City Campus) will relocate to a new purpose built facility around 2015.[14]</p>
