<p></p>
<p>The <strong>&#x00c9;cole Centrale de Lyon</strong>, founded in 1857, is  one of the oldest universities in France.
It is considered as one of the most prestigious  <a>French</a> <a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a> of <a>engineering</a> continuously ranking as one of the Top 6 French Engineering research institutions for the post Bachelor study.
The university is situated in <a>&#x00c9;cully</a>, a western suburb of <a>Lyon</a>, <a>France</a> (in a region called <a>Rh&#x00f4;nes Alpes</a>).</p>
<p>The University is one of the 5 members of the Centrale Graduate Schools (Lille, Paris, Marseille, Nantes, Pekin).
The school is well-reputed for educating and training highly skilled engineers with a minimum degree of BSc through the many specialized postgraduate programs.
Ecole Centrale de Lyon is a founding member of University of Lyon, Pole Research and Higher Education (PRES) established as a public establishment of scientific cooperation.
The Schools excels in the research attached to Acoustics, Biosciences and Nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Ecole Centrale de Lyon, or as sometimes referred to ECL, has strong ties with top institutions in Europe including <a>Imperial College London</a> and <a>Darmstadt University of Technology</a>.
This in addition to having most of its post graduate programs shared between <a>INSA Lyon</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure de Lyon</a> and <a>Claude Bernard University Lyon 1</a>.</p>
<h2>History and Location</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1857 on a private initiative by <a>D&#x00e9;sir&#x00e9; Girardon</a>, who was its first President.
The founding vision was to educate multidisciplinary engineers for the emerging industry (&#x201c;doctors for fabs and plants&#x201d;).
The institution was given to the French State Ministry of Education in 1947.
Initially located downtown Lyon, it was transferred to &#x00c9;cully, its current location.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The <em>centralien</em> program is the main academic program offered by the &#x00c9;cole Centrale de Lyon, as a <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>.
It is quite different from typical university or college studies; and specific to the French system of Grandes &#x00e9;coles.
The engineering degree of &#x00e9;cole centrale de Lyon (<em>Ing&#x00e9;nieur centralien</em> or &#x201c;centralien engineer&#x201d;) is a <a>Master of Science</a> degree.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of the curriculum is that it is multidisciplinary, with studies focusing on all math and physics derived engineering specialties: mechanics, physics, materials, fluid mechanics, electrical engineering,  applied mathematics, civil engineering, aeronautics, computer science, telecommunications and micro-nano-biotechnology.</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>The large majority of the students are admitted after two to three years of <a>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</a>, known as &quot;mathematics superior&quot; and &quot;mathematics special&quot;, which are an undergraduate cursus with almost exclusive emphasis on Math and Physics.
These undergraduate students must then take a nation-wide competitive entrance examination (<a>Concours Centrale-Sup&#x00e9;lec</a>) to enter a <a>Centrale Graduate School</a>, including Ecole Centrale de Lyon.
Ecole Centrale de Lyon recruits among the top 6% of the students in <em>classes preparatoires</em>, which makes it a selective and prestigious institution.
A few seats are available each year to select students from French universities after completion of three or four years of post high-school education.
A significant contingent of students also comes from leading international universities which belong to the <a>TIME</a> network (<a>Top Industrial Managers for Europe</a>).</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Education at the ECL is multidisciplinary and typically lasts three to four years.
During the first two years (<em>Tronc commun</em>, or &#x201c;Common Trunk&#x201d;), students take mandatory classes in science (Mathematics, Physics); in engineering (Solids Mechanics, Heat transfer, Digital image processing, Computer programming,&#x2026;) and in social sciences (Economics, Management, foreign languages,&#x2026;).
Students are then offered to sign up for different engineering specialties during their last year at the school.
After completing these 3 years of education, they receive the degree of &#x201c;ing&#x00e9;nieur de l'&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lyon&#x201d;, more commonly called &#x201c;ing&#x00e9;nieur centralien&#x201d;.</p>
<h2>National and international ties</h2>
<p>The <em>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lyon</em> belongs to the French <a>intergroupe des &#x00e9;coles centrales</a>, together with <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale Paris</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Lille</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Nantes</a>, <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de Marseille</a> and <a>&#x00c9;cole centrale de P&#x00e9;kin</a>  .</p>
<p>Since 1857, the school has built important international ties.
Students come from around the world to study for several years on the school campus.
<em>&#x00c9;cole centrale</em> students may also obtain a &#x201c;double diploma&#x201d; at one of several partner schools.
Furthermore, the &#x00c9;cole is one of the founding members of the <a>TIME</a> network (<a>Top Industrial Managers for Europe</a>).
