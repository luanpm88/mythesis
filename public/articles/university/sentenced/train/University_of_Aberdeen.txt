<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Aberdeen</strong> is an <a>ancient university</a> founded in 1495, in <a>Aberdeen</a>, <a>Scotland</a>.
It is the third oldest university in <a>Scotland</a> and the fifth oldest in the <a>United Kingdom</a> and wider <a>English-speaking world</a>.</p>
<p>The modern University of Aberdeen was formed in 1860 by the merger of two pre-existing ancient universities: <a>King's College</a>, located in <a>Old Aberdeen</a> and <a>Marischal College</a>, founded in 1593 and located in the new city of <a>Aberdeen</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>King's and Marischal Colleges</h3>
<p>: <em>See also <a>King's College, Aberdeen</a> and <a>Marischal College</a> for history pre-1860</em></p>
<p>The University of Aberdeen is one of the <a>ancient universities of Scotland</a>.
The first university in Aberdeen, <a>King's College</a>, was founded in February 1495 by <a>William Elphinstone</a>, <a>Bishop of Aberdeen</a> and <a>Chancellor</a> of <a>Scotland</a>, drafting a request on behalf of <a>King James IV</a> to <a>Pope Alexander VI</a> resulting in a <a>Papal Bull</a> being issued.
The university was established near <a>St Machar's Cathedral</a>, and its chapel, consecrated in 1509, was dedicated to the Trinity and the Blessed Virgin Mary in her Nativity.
The first principal was <a>Hector Boece</a>, graduate and professor of the <a>University of Paris</a>, who worked closely with Elphinstone to develop the university.
</p>
<p>[[Image:Marischalcollege1.jpg|left|thumb|[[Marischal
College]] with the new front under construction; circa 1900]] Following the <a>Reformation</a>, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change.
<a>George Keith</a>, the fifth <a>Earl Marischal</a> was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of <a>Peter Ramus</a>.
In April 1593 he consequently founded a second university in the city, <a>Marischal College</a>.
(It is noteworthy that Aberdeen was highly unusual at the time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses wryly observed, Aberdeen alone had the same number as existed in all of England at the time.)
It is also possible that the founding of another college in nearby <a>Fraserburgh</a> by <a>Sir Alexander Fraser</a>, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation.
</p>
<p>Initially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused by the King's authorities - cited as the first blow in a future rivalry.
Marischal College, being located in the commercial heart of the city rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of King's in Old Aberdeen, was quite different in nature and outlook, very much integrated into the life of the city, for example allowing its students to live outwith the College.
The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes more abstractly in legal matters, but not infrequently also more physically in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen itself.
</p>
<p>As the institutions eventually began to put aside their differences a process of attempted (but unconsummated) mergers began in the seventeenth century and it was during this time that notable contributions were made by both to the <a>Scottish Enlightenment</a>.
Both Colleges supported the <a>Jacobite</a> cause and following the defeat of the <a>1715 rising</a> both were largely purged of their academics and officials.</p>
<h3>The University of Aberdeen's creation</h3>
<p>The nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the &quot;Caroline University of Aberdeen&quot;, a merger initiated by <a>Charles I of Scotland</a> in 1641.
The final unification was brought following the ratification of Parliament by <a>Oliver Cromwell</a> during the <a>interregnum</a> in 1654.
This united university survived until the <a>Restoration</a> whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by <a>Charles II</a> and the two colleges reverted to independent status.
Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's seven Founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.
Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.</p>
<h3>The modern university</h3>
<p>The relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years.
While at the time of unification there were roughly equal numbers in each, Marischal began an expansion in the later nineteenth century with a significant rebuilding effort ending in 1906.
However in more recent years, the teaching of medicine has gravitated towards the university's Foresterhill Hospital site and science and engineering teaching activities towards King's, which has benefited from its distance from the centre of Aberdeen and expanded from its traditional collegiate appearance to a modern campus with the traditional buildings at its heart.
There are no longer any students being taught at the Marischal College campus as the building is currently being refurbished by <a>Aberdeen City Council</a> as its new headquarters.</p>
<p>Construction work began in 2009 on a &#x00a3;57 million new central library on campus to replace the existing Queen Mother Library.
It is expected to open in summer 2011.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>:<em>Main Article <a>Ancient university governance in Scotland</a></em> In common with the other <a>ancient universities</a> in Scotland, the university's structure of governance is largely regulated by the <a>Universities (Scotland) Acts</a>.
This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the <a>General Council</a> of senior academics and graduates, the <a>University Court</a> responsible for finances and administration, and the <a>Academic Senate</a> (<em>Senatus Academicus</em>)--the university's supreme academic body.
</p>
<p>There are correspondingly three main officers of the university.
It is nominally headed by the <a>Chancellor</a>, a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the <a>Bishop of Aberdeen</a> but divorced from the see as a result of the <a>Scottish Reformation</a> and holders are now elected for life by the General Council.
There is also a <a>Rector of the University</a>, who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests.
</p>
<p>The administrative head and <a>chief executive</a> of the university is its <a>Principal and Vice Chancellor</a>.
The Principal acts as chair of the Senatus Academicus and his status as <a>Vice Chancellor</a> enables him to perform the functions reserved to the Chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.</p>
<h3>Chancellor</h3>
<p>The <a>Chancellor</a> is the nominal head of the university.
The current Chancellor since 1997 is <a>David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn</a>, a retired diplomat and former <a>Governor of Hong Kong</a>.
The Chancellor, or, if necessary, his deputy, confers degrees on graduates and chairs the university's General Council.</p>
<h3>Lord Rector</h3>
<p> The <a>Rector</a> of the university has been&#x2014;since 1860&#x2014;elected by the students to serve a three-year term of office; before that, the office was appointed.
His duties are to chair meetings of the University Court and to represent student views on that body.
The incumbent Rector is <a>Stephen Robertson MBE</a>, a local comedian and former solicitor.
He was elected in 2008.</p>
<h3>Principal and Vice-Chancellor</h3>
<p>The <a>Principal</a> and <a>Vice Chancellor</a> of the University of Aberdeen is <a>Professor Ian Diamond</a>, since April 1, 2010.
He took over from Professor Sir <a>Duncan Rice</a> who was Principal and Vice Chancellor since September 1996.</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The original buildings of both colleges which united to form the University are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen.
Many newer campus buildings are of largely <a>modernist</a> style and focused around the expanding campus around King's College, which now hosts all of the university's teaching facilities outside of the two more recent sites: Foresterhill and Hilton, home to the faculties of Medicine and Education respectively.</p>
<p>King's College campus also includes other modern buildings; some, such as the Fraser Noble Building, with a distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College, echo the existing architecture of <a>Old Aberdeen</a>.
Also on the site is the <a>Cruickshank Botanic Garden</a> which was presented to the university in 1899.</p>
<h3>Marischal College</h3>
<p><em>See also: <a>Marischal College</a></em></p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Marischal College</a><strong><a>Marischal College</a></strong> is a stately <a>neo-Gothic</a> building, having been rebuilt in 1836-41, and greatly extended several years later.
The additions to the buildings opened by <a>King Edward VII</a> in 1906, form one of the most splendid examples of neo-Gothic <a>architecture</a> in <a>Great Britain</a>; the architect, <a>Alexander Marshall Mackenzie</a>, a native of Aberdeen, having adapted his material, white granite, to the design of a noble building to noteworthy effect.
The beautiful Mitchell Tower is so named from the benefactor (Dr <a>Charles Mitchell</a>) who provided the splendid graduation hall.
The opening of this tower in 1895 signalled the commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the university.
Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle.
</p>
<p>The building is now mostly let to <a>Aberdeen City Council</a>, although the University controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall, which is used for graduation and other academic ceremonies.</p>
<h4>Hilton</h4>
<p>The Hilton site became part of the university estate following its merger with the Aberdeen Campus of the Northern College in December 2001 and temporarily hosted the university's Faculty of Education.
It lies less than a mile southwest of King's College campus.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>As of 2009/10 the university has around 14,000 students, 3900 being postgraduates, representing 120 different countries with about 46% men, 54% women, and 19% mature undergraduates.
The university has more than 590 different first degree programmes and more than 110 postgraduate taught programmes.</p>
<h3>Student representation</h3>
<p>The student body is represented within the University by a <a>Students' Association</a> known as <a>Aberdeen University Students' Association</a> (AUSA).
Additionally, the elected <a>Rector of the University of Aberdeen</a> serves along with the Rector's Assessor and AUSA President as a students' representatives on the University Court.</p>
<p>Following financial problems in the early 2000s, AUSA ceased to provide a traditional Students' Union for its members.
The organisation has been involved in the creation of &quot;The Hub&quot;, a university-owned student dining and social centre created out of the former Central Refectory in King's College campus, which opened in 2006.
</p>
<p>During term time, AUSA publishes a fortnightly student newspaper called the <a>Gaudie</a> and hosts a radio station,  <a>Aberdeen Student Radio</a>.
In 2009 an independent student newspaper was published at the university, <a>Vox Pop</a>, but despite significant support closed down at the end of the year due to financial constraints.</p>
<h3>Organisations</h3>
<p>A number of linked organisations cater to the students of the university.
There are over a hundred clubs and societies formally affiliated with the students' association.
</p>
<p>The oldest student organisation at the university is the Aberdeen University Debater, the university's <a>debating union</a>, constituted in 1848.
The first successful university newspaper, <em>Alma Mater</em>,  began under the auspices of the Debater in 1883.
In 1884, the Debater also took the first steps towards the introduction of a <a>Students' Representative Council</a> under support from <a>Alexander Bain</a> the then Rector.</p>
<p>The creation of the Union in 1895 provided a new debating chamber in Marischal College and the first permanent home of the society.
The chamber beneath Mitchell Hall in Marischal College is the oldest purpose-built debating chamber in Scotland.
For a time immediately after the turn of the century both the Union and the society were organising debates, which ultimately led to a merger in 1913 before being revived as separate institutions in 1920.</p>
<p>The students' association is responsible for sport at the university, which is managed by the <a>Aberdeen University Sports Union</a>, an AUSA committee.
</p>
<h3>University accommodation</h3>
<p>Halls of residence are managed by the University.
Two large concentrations of University accommodation are provided on the campus in Old Aberdeen, consisting of Crombie-Johnston Halls (both individual but sister halls) and King's Halls of Residence, and a short distance away the <a>Hillhead Halls Of Residence</a> site, where there is a social centre with porters, catering, sports and computer facilities, in addition to on-site launderettes, a bar and a shop.</p>
<p>Following their first year, the majority of students opt to live in private accommodation off of the main university campus, although in recent years, prices and availability of accommodation has seen more second and third year students returning to university halls.
This has forced the university to write to all students in university accommodation, in February 2008 and 2009, to let them know that accommodation will be reserved for first year students only in the academic year to follow.</p>
<p>The University has advertised a <em>First-Year Accommodation Guarantee</em> in recent years, but due to the high demand for homes in the rapidly growing city it has become increasingly difficult to fulfil the guarantee.
At the start of the 2007-2008 term,  the university ran out of rooms, and had to resort to temporary accommodation (including putting students into hotel rooms, and making kitchens, study rooms and common rooms into dorm rooms).</p>
<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>The students' association is responsible for sport at the university, which is managed by the <a>Aberdeen University Sports Union</a>, an AUSA committee.
</p>
<p>There are sports facilities at the back of King's College.
Adjacent to the King's College playing fields is the Aberdeen Sports Village, a partnership between the University of Aberdeen, <a>Aberdeen City Council</a> and <a>sportscotland</a>.
The venue includes a nine-court indoor hall, full-sized synthetic football pitch, fitness suite, squash courts and a sports performance lab among other facilities.
The &#x00a3;28 million development on the site of the former Chris Anderson Stadium, opened on 24 August 2009.
A 50m swimming pool is to be constructed in the site by end of 2014.</p>
