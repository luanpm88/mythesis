<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p><a>thumb|New York Normal College seen from Park Avenue (1874)</a> Hunter College has its origins in the 19th-century movement for <a>normal school</a> training which swept across the <a>United States</a>.
Hunter descends from the <strong>Female Normal and High School</strong> (later renamed the <strong>Normal College of the City of New York</strong>), organized in <a>New York City</a> in 1870.
Founded by Irish immigrant <a>Thomas Hunter</a>, who was president of the school during the first 37 years, it was originally a <a>women's college</a> for training teachers.
The school, which was housed in an armory and saddle store at Broadway and East Fourth Street in Manhattan, was open to all qualified women, irrespective of race, religion or ethnic background.
At the time most women's colleges had racial or ethno-religious admissions criteria.
</p>
<p>Created by the New York State Legislature, Hunter was deemed the only approved institution for those seeking to teach in New York City.
The school incorporated an elementary and high school for <a>gifted children</a>, where students practiced teaching.
In 1887, a <a>kindergarten</a> was established as well.
(Today, the <a>elementary school</a> and the <a>high school</a> still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter College Campus Schools.)</p>
<p>During Thomas Hunter's tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics.
The first female professor at the school, <a>Helen Gray Cone</a>, was elected to the position in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The college's student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, in 1873, into a new <a>Gothic</a> structure, now known as Thomas Hunter Hall, on Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets.
The hall was probably designed by the architect Snyder.</p>
<p>In 1888 the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, with the power to confer the degree of <a>A.B.</a>
This led to the separation of the school into two &quot;camps&quot;: the &quot;Normals&quot;, who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the &quot;Academics&quot;, who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree.
After 1902 when the &quot;Normal&quot; course of study was abolished, the &quot;Academic&quot; course became standard across the student body.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The North Building (left) was added in the 1930's on the previous gardens facing Park Avenue and destroying a large part of the original building (right), today Thomas Hunter Hall</a> <a>thumb|North Building at Park Avenue (2010)</a> In 1914 the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president.
At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space.
The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of <a>Brooklyn</a>, <a>Queens</a>, and <a>Staten Island</a>.
By 1920, Hunter College had the largest enrollment of women of any municipally financed college in the United States.
In 1930, Hunter's Brooklyn campus merged with <a>City College</a>'s Brooklyn campus, and the two were spun off to form <a>Brooklyn College</a>.</p>
<p>Between the 1938 and 1939 the garden at Park Avenue was given up for the construction of the north building.
The expansion also destroyed a large part of the neo-gothic original structure, fusing them together.
Only the back part facing Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th street remain from the original building.
</p>
<p>The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus).
During the <a>Second World War</a>, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the <a>United States Navy</a> who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as <a>WAVES</a> and <a>SPARS</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Free

When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent <a>United Nations</a>, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.&lt;ref&gt;<a>History of Lehman College</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1943, <a>Eleanor Roosevelt</a> dedicated a town house at 47-49 East 65th Street in Manhattan to the college.
The house had been a home for the future <a>President</a> and First Lady.
Today it is known as The Roosevelt House of Public Policy and opened in Fall 2010 as an academic center hosting prominent speakers.</p>
<h3>The CUNY era</h3>
<p>Hunter became the <a>women's college</a> of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when <a>City College</a> became <a>coeducational</a>, Hunter started admitting men to its <a>Bronx</a> campus.
In 1964, the <a>Manhattan</a> campus began admitting men also.
The Bronx campus subsequently became <a>Lehman College</a> in 1968.</p>
<p>In 1968-1969, Black and Puerto Rican students struggled to get a department that would teach about their history and experience.
These and supportive students and faculty expressed this demand through building take-overs, rallies, etc.
In Spring 1969, Hunter College established Black and Puerto Rican Studies (now called Africana/Puerto Rican and Latino Studies).
An &quot;<a>open admissions</a>&quot; policy initiated in 1970 by the City University of New York opened the school's doors to historically underrepresented groups by guaranteeing a college education to any and all who graduated from NYC high schools.
Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and even after the end of &quot;open admissions&quot; still comprise a large part of the school's student body.
As a result of this increase in enrollment, Hunter opened new buildings on Lexington Avenue during the early 1980s.
In further advancing Puerto Rican studies, Hunter became home to the Centro de Estudios Puertorrique&#x00f1;os (&quot;Center for Puerto Rican Studies&quot; or simply &quot;Centro&quot;) in 1982.</p>
<p>Today, Hunter College is a comprehensive teaching and research institution.
Of the more than 20,000 students enrolled at Hunter, nearly 5,000 are enrolled in a graduate program, the most popular of which are education and <a>social work</a>.
Although less than 28% of students are the first in their families to attend college, the college maintains its tradition of concern for women's education, with nearly three out of four students being female.
In 2006, Hunter became home to the <a>Bella Abzug</a> Leadership Institute, which will run training programs for young women to build their leadership, public speaking, business and advocacy skills.
<a>Princeton Review</a> named the college as <a>one of America's &quot;Best Value&quot; Colleges</a> in its 2007 guide.</p>
<p>In recent years, the college has integrated its undergraduate and graduate programs to successfully make advanced programs in fields such as (<a>Psychology</a> and <a>Biology</a>) - &quot;Ph.D Program&quot;, (<a>Education</a>) - &quot;Master's Program&quot;, (<a>Mathematics</a>) - &quot;Master's Program&quot;, -&quot;Ph.D Program&quot;(<a>Biology</a> &amp; <a>Chemistry</a>) - &quot;<a>Biochemistry</a>&quot;, (<a>Accounting</a>) - &quot;Master's Program&quot; along with the highly competitive (<a>Economics</a>) - &quot;Master's Program&quot; to which only a select few students may enter based on excellent scholarship and performance, and less than half will earn a Master's Degree by maintaining a nearly perfect academic record and performing thesis research.</p>
<p>Although far from the polar regions, Hunter is a member institution of the <a>University of the Arctic</a>, a network of schools providing education accessible to northern students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>University of the Arctic - MEMBERS - LIST OF MEMBERS</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
