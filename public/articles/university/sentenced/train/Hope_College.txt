<p>Traditions at Hope include &quot;The Pull&quot; and Nykerk cup, events which pit freshman and sophomore classes against each other.
In &quot;The Pull,&quot; freshmen and sophomore men engage in an elaborately prepared three-hour tug-of-war across the nearby <a>Black River</a>, with women students acting as moralers.
This event was started in 1897.
The Nykerk Cup is a competition between freshman and sophomore women (with men as moralers) in music, drama, and oration, held annually since 1936.
Both traditions include separate duties based on gender and although there is slight criticism for this, both events are popular, well attended, and enjoy strong support from the campus community.

About 10-12% of students belong to social fraternities and sororities, which are local with the exception of one fraternity and one sorority (Phi Sigma Kappa and Delta Sigma Theta respectively) to Hope rather than chapters of larger organizations.
The college holds Sunday evening worship services (&quot;The Gathering&quot;) and Monday/Wednesday/Friday chapel services on campus.
Attendance at these events has been voluntary since 1970.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The Anchor, symbol of Hope College</a> Hope's motto is taken from <a>Psalm</a> 42:5: &quot;Spera in Deo&quot; (&quot;Hope in God&quot;).
The college's emblem is an <a>anchor</a>.
This is drawn from a speech made by <a>Albertus van Raalte</a>, the leader of the community, on the occasion of the founding of the Pioneer School in 1851: &quot;This is my anchor of hope for this people in the future,&quot; (an allusion to <a>Hebrews</a> 6:19).
The primary-level Pioneer School was later expanded to secondary, and soon after, college level education as Hope College.
Van Vleck Hall, which originally housed the Pioneer School, is the oldest building on campus (1858) and now serves as a dormitory.
It is the second oldest building in the city.
The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862, and Hope received its state charter in 1866.
The college admitted its first female students in 1878.</p>
