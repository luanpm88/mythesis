<p>The <strong>Florida State University</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Florida State</strong> or <strong>FSU</strong>) is a <a>space-grant</a> and <a>sea-grant</a> <a>public university</a> located in <a>Tallahassee, Florida</a>, United States.
It is a comprehensive <a>doctoral</a> <a>research university</a> with medical programs and significant research activity as determined by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a>.
The university comprises 15 separate <a>colleges</a> and 39 centers, facilities, labs and institutes that offer more than 300 programs of study, including professional programs.
Florida State was officially established in 1851 and is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.
As one of Florida's primary graduate research universities, Florida State University awards over 2,000 graduate and professional <a>degrees</a> each year.
In 2007, Florida State was placed in the first tier of research universities by the Florida Legislature, a distinction allowing FSU, along with the University of Florida, to charge 40% higher tuition than other institutions in the State University System of Florida.</p>
<p>The Florida State University is also home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas, including the sciences, engineering, social policy, film, music, theater, dance, visual art, business, political science, psychology and social work, medicine, and law.
Florida State is home to Florida's only National Laboratory - the <a>National High Magnetic Field Laboratory</a> and is the birthplace of the commercially-viable anti-<a>cancer</a> drug <a>Taxol</a>.
The Florida State University athletics programs are favorites of passionate students, fans and alumni across the United States, which often appear in conjunction with the <a>Marching Chiefs</a> of the FSU College of Music.
Florida State is a member of the <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a> and has won twelve national athletic championships as well as multiple individual competitor NCAA championship awards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>  [[File:WFS rc04562.jpg|thumb|left|West
Florida Seminary main building, circa 1880.
Built in 1854 as the Florida Institute.
This building was replaced with College Hall in 1891.
The [[Westcott Building]] now stands on this site - the oldest site of higher education in Florida]] The Florida State University traces its origins to a plan set by the 1823 Territorial Legislature of Florida to create a system of higher education.
The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the basic system by providing for land allocated for the schools.
In 1851 the Florida Legislature voted to establish two seminaries of higher education on opposite sides of the <a>Suwannee River</a>.
<a>Francis W. Eppes</a> and other city leaders established an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the <strong>West Florida Seminary</strong> in <a>Tallahassee</a>.
The <a>East Florida Seminary</a> opened in <a>Ocala</a> in 1853, closed in 1861, and reopened in <a>Gainesville</a> in 1866.
The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern <a>University of Florida</a> traces its foundation.</em></p>
<p><a>thumb|right|140px|William Denham, West Florida Seminary cadet during the Civil War</a> In 1856, the land and buildings in an area formerly known as <a>Gallows</a> Hill &#x2013; where the Florida Institute was built &#x2013; was accepted as the site of the state seminary for male students.
Two years later the institution absorbed the <a>Tallahassee Female Academy</a> founded in 1843 as the Misses Bates School and became coeducational.
The West Florida Seminary stood near the front of the Westcott Building on the existing FSU campus, making this site the oldest continually used location of higher learning in Florida.</p>
<h3>Student soldiers</h3>
<p>In 1860-61 the legislature started formal military training at the school with a law amending the original 1851 statute.
<a>During the Civil War</a>, the seminary became <strong>The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute.</strong>
Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself as perhaps the largest and most respected educational institution in the state.
The students were trained by <a>Valentine Mason Johnson</a>, a graduate of <a>Virginia Military Institute</a>, who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college.
After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose.</p>
<h3>First state university</h3>
<p>In February 1883 the West Florida Seminary became part of Florida University, the first state <a>university</a> in Florida.
Under the new university charter, the seminary became the institution's Literary College, and was to contain several &quot;schools&quot; or departments in different disciplines.
Florida University also incorporated the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery, and recognized three more colleges to be established at a later date.
Without legislative support, the university project struggled.
The institution never assumed the &quot;university&quot; title, By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the <a>South</a> to be awarded a chapter of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, as well as the first university in Florida so honored.
Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women (1905 to 1947) until 1919.</p>
<p>The influx of <a>G.I. Bill students</a> after <a>World War II</a> stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in <a>barracks</a> on nearby <a>Dale Mabry Field</a>.
By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it the <strong>Florida State University</strong>.
The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the <a>Tallahassee Community College</a>.
The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business, <a>Journalism</a> (discontinued in 1959), <a>Library Science</a>, <a>Nursing</a> and Social Welfare.
during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>.
The school is also purported to have originated the 1970s fad of &quot;<a>streaking</a>&quot;, said to have been first observed on Landis Green.
</em></p>
<p>After many years as a segregated university, in 1962 Maxwell Courtney became the first <a>African American</a> undergraduate student admitted to Florida State.
In 1968 Calvin Patterson became the first <a>African American</a> player for the Florida State University football team.
Florida State today has the highest graduation rate for African American students of all universities in Florida.</p>
<p>On March 4, 1969 the FSU chapter of <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, an unregistered university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings.
The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently decided not to allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group.
The result was a protest and <a>mass arrest</a> at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets.
The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis.
Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at <a>Kent State University</a> causing classes to be canceled.
Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines.
Joining the all-night vigil, Governor <a>Claude Kirk</a> appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.
The university owns more than 1,530 acres (6.2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) and is the home of the <a>National High Magnetic Field Laboratory</a> among other advanced research facilities.
The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research.
Other milestones at the university include the first <a>ETA10-G/8</a> <a>supercomputer</a>, capable of 10.8 <a>GFLOPS</a> in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the <a>Cray-2/8</a>, located at the <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug <a>Taxol</a>.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Florida State University Honors Program is a specially designed program for the most accomplished incoming undergraduates.
Undergraduates in Honors participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned research in the area of the sponsoring faculty member.
Admission to Honors is competitive.
The FSU Honors Medical and Law early-admission, professional-track programs are designed to facilitate faster access to professional programs for the limited number of students who meet required standards.
Honors students are eligible for the Honors residence hall and associated administrative benefits.</p>
<h3>Limited Access Programs</h3>
<p>A number of undergraduate academic programs at the Florida State University are termed &quot;Limited Access Programs&quot;.
Limited Access Programs are programs where student demand exceeds available resources.
Admission is thus restricted and sometimes extremely competitive.
Examples of limited access programs include The <a>Florida State University Film School</a>, the College of Communication, the College of Nursing, most of the majors in the College of Education, several majors in the College of Visual Arts, Music, Theatre and Dance and all majors in the College of Business.</p>
<h3>Young Scholars Program</h3>
<p>The <a>FSU Young Scholars Program</a> is a competitive residential <a>science</a> and <a>mathematics</a> program for 40 <a>Florida</a> <a>high-school students</a> with potential for careers in the <a>sciences</a>, <a>engineering</a>, and <a>health professions</a>.
Admission to the FSU YSP generally requires completing the eleventh grade and scoring at least 90% on a national standardized examination such as the SAT or PSAT.
The PSAT Math average is approximately 96% and the PSAT verbal average is approximately 94%.
Many students are first in their class at their home schools with 79% being in the top ten of their class.</p>
<h3>Tuition</h3>
<p>Fall 2009 undergraduate tuition costs are <a>$</a>150.87
dollars per credit hour for in-state tuition while out-of-state tuition is $632.35
dollars per credit hour.
Fall 2009 graduate tuition costs are $322.71
dollars per credit hour for in-state tuition, and out-of-state tuition is $954.11
dollars per credit hour.
Fall 2009 law school tuition costs are $473.32
dollars per credit hour for in-state tuition, and out-of-state tuition is $1,040.35
dollars per credit hour.
&lt;small&gt;<em>This table does not include deferred&lt;br /&gt;applications or other unique situations.</em>&lt;/small&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt; The middle 50% of the Fall 2010 incoming freshmen class had a <a>GPA</a> range from 3.6 - 4.1; a <a>SAT</a> range from 1150&#x2013;1300 and a <a>ACT</a> range from 25 - 29.  FSU's freshman retention rate is 91%.
Florida State has one of the highest retention rates in the United States.</p>
<p><strong><a>Rhodes Scholars</a></strong></p>
<p>In 2008, Florida State <a>undergraduate</a> and football player <a>Myron Rolle</a> earned the prestigious <a>Rhodes Scholarship</a> award.
Rolle is the fourth FSU student overall to earn this award and the third since 2005.
Joe O'Shea, an FSU Student Body President, and <a>Garrett Johnson</a>, an FSU student athlete, earned the award in 2007 and 2005, respectively.
Only thirty two students in the United States earn the award each year.</p>

Florida State's faculty include recipients of the <a>Nobel Prize</a>, the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>, <a>Guggenheim Fellowships</a>, <a>Academy Awards</a>, and other accolades.
Florida State is represented by faculty serving in a number of renowned <a>Academies</a>, <a>Associations</a> and <a>Societies</a>.
Florida State was home to the first <a>ETA10-G/8</a> <a>supercomputer</a>. Professor <a>E.
Imre Friedmann</a> and researcher Dr. Roseli Friedmann demonstrated <a>primitive</a> life could survive in rocks, establishing the potential for life on other planets.</p>
<p>Florida State University researchers developed the anti-cancer drug <a>Taxol</a>.
A number of groups based in the United States, including one led by <a>Robert A. Holton</a>, attempted a <a>total synthesis</a> of the molecule, starting from <a>petrochemical</a>-derived starting materials.
By late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process.
The Florida State University, where Holton worked, signed a deal with <a>Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> to license this and future patents.
In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield.
Taxol remains the best-selling anti-cancer drug ever manufactured, and the most commercially viable product ever created by a university in Florida.</p>
<h3>International Programs</h3>
<p>For over 50 years the Florida State University has operated a broad curriculum program in <a>Panama City, Panama</a>.

This facility is the largest and highest powered laboratory of its kind in the world and produces the highest continuous magnetic fields.</p>
<h4>MIT Contest of lab award</h4>
<p>The <a>National Science Foundation</a> awarded the Florida State University the right in 1990 to host the new National High Magnetic Field Laboratory rather than improve the existing Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory controlled by the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) together with a <a>consortium</a> of other universities.
The NSF denied the appeal, explaining that the superior enthusiasm for and commitment to the project demonstrated by Florida State led to the decision to relocate the lab.</p>
<h3>High energy physics</h3>
<p>After decades of planning and construction the <a>Compact Muon Solenoid</a> (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton collider (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the <a>Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17&nbsp;mi (27&nbsp;km) circular underground tunnel near <a>Geneva, Switzerland</a> at <a>CERN</a>, the <a>European Laboratory for Particle Physics</a>.
Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation.
Florida State faculty contributed to several areas of the CMS, especially the electromagnetic calorimeter and the hadron calorimeter.</p>

<p> [[File:FSUPlaza.JPG|thumb|left|The center of campus, Live Oak trees with hanging [[Spanish Moss]] are found everywhere on campus]]Located just  from the main campus in Tallahassee.
Continuing its pledge to academic excellence, FSU Panama City is committed to providing area students with a quality education from a nationally-accredited university.
Beginning in the early 1980s.
Since that time the campus has grown to almost 1,500 students supported by 15 bachelor's and 19 graduate degree programs.</p>
<p>FSU Panama City began offering full-time daytime programs in fall 2000.
This scheduling, coupled with programs offered in the evenings, serves to accommodate the needs of its diverse student population.
Over 30 resident faculty were hired to help staff the programs.
Nestled among oaks along the waters of North Bay and only three miles from the Gulf of Mexico the Florida State University Panama City campus offers upper-division undergraduate courses as well as some graduate and specialist degree programs.</p>
<p>Since opening in 1982, over 4,000 students have graduated from FSU Panama City with degrees ranging from elementary education to engineering.

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Students study surveying and engineering in 1900</a> <a>thumb|right|It is traditional for students to be dunked in the Westcott fountain on special occasions</a> <a>thumb|right|Bryan Hall, oldest building on campus</a> <a>thumb|right|Wildwood Hall, constructed 2006</a> <a>thumb|right|Ragans Hall, apartment style Residence Hall</a> The school's colors are <a>garnet</a> and <a>gold</a>.
The colors of garnet and gold represent a merging of the university's past.
While the school fielded a football team as early, or earlier than 1899, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms.
When FSC became the Florida State College for Women in 1905, the football team and fraternity system was forced to attend the now all male school in Gainesville, thus marking the beginning of the football program at the University of Florida.
The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color.
The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet.
After World War II the garnet and gold colors were first worn by a nenewed football team in a 14-6 loss to <a>Stetson University</a> on October 18, 1947.</em></p>
<p>Florida State is also the home of the <a>Marching Chiefs</a>, the FSU marching band.
The Marching Chiefs are the band behind the famous &quot;<a>War Chant</a>&quot;.
The War Chant is derived from a musical cheer first played during the 1960s.</p>
<p>The Florida State University fight song was written by Florida State music professor, Thomas Wright, who grants rights to the song in exchange for two season tickets every year.
The 1950 Florida State University Homecoming halftime show included a dedication ceremony naming the stadium in honor of university President Doak Campbell.
A special performance by the band christened it the <a>Marching Chiefs</a> and premiered the Florida State University Fight Song.
Thirty-three years later the FSU Fight Song was used by <a>Mission Control</a> to awaken alumnus and current professor <a>Norm Thagard</a> one morning in 1983 while he was aboard the <a><em>Challenger</em></a> <a>spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Lyrics:</p>
<p>We've got to fight, fight, fight for F.S.U.
/ We've got to scalp 'em Seminoles / We've got to win, win, win, win, win this game / And roll on down and make those goals / For F.S.U. is on the warpath now / And at the battle's end she's great / So fight, fight, fight, fight for victory / The Seminoles of Florida State / F-L-O-R-I-D-A S-T-A-T-E / Florida State, Florida State, Florida State /</p>

(No issues are published during Spring Break or Winter Break.)
After changing hands three times in 13 years, the <em>FSView</em> was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the <a>Gannett</a> chain.
This exchange was allowed because the <em>FSView</em> had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with the Florida State University.
Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the very first time that a major corporation acquired a college newspaper.
(Gannett had acquired the local Tallahassee paper, <em>The Democrat</em> in the few years preceding the acquisition of the <em>FSView</em>.)
<em>FSView</em> also produces <em>Edge Magazine</em>, geared towards students, advertisements for local establishments, and a &quot;Tally Girl&quot; model.</p>
<p>The Florida State University, through its <a>Broadcast</a> Center, operates two <a>television</a> stations, <a>WFSU</a> and <a>WFSG</a>, and three <a>radio</a> stations, <a>WFSU-FM</a>, <a>WFSQ-FM</a> and <a>WFSW-FM</a>.</em>
FSU operates a fourth radio station, <a>WVFS</a> (V89, &quot;The Voice&quot;, or &quot;The Voice of Florida State&quot;), as an on-campus instructional radio station staffed by student and community volunteers.
