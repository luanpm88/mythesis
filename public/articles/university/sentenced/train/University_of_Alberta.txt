<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Alberta (U of A)</strong> is a <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in <a>Edmonton</a>, <a>Alberta</a>, <a>Canada</a>.
Founded in 1908 by <a>Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a>, the first premier of Alberta and <a>Henry Marshall Tory</a>, its first president, it is widely recognized as one of the best universities in Canada.
The main campus covers 50 city blocks with over 90 buildings directly across the <a>North Saskatchewan River</a> from <a>downtown Edmonton</a>.
The enabling legislation is the <em>Post-secondary Learning Act.</em> </p>
<p> the continued economic boom in Alberta, driven mainly by high energy prices, had resulted in multi-billion dollar government fiscal surpluses.
This led to the introduction of Bill 1 by the provincial government, which creates a $4.5 billion endowment for Alberta's post-secondary institutions.</p>
<h2>History and Overview</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Arts Building, University of Alberta campus.</a>
<a>thumb|200px|right|Tory building at the University of Alberta</a> <a>thumb|left|Biology Building at the University of Alberta</a> <a>thumb|200px|right|Corbett Hall, University of Alberta campus.</a></p>
<p>The University of Alberta, a single, public provincial university, was chartered in 1906 in <a>Edmonton, Alberta</a> with a new University Act.
University of Alberta was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.</p>
<p>University of Alberta is a non-denominational university which offers undergraduate and graduate programs.
With the hiring of <a>Henry Marshall Tory</a> in 1907, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908 using temporary facilities, while the first building on campus was under construction.
The University of Alberta was established by the University Act, 1906 in the first session of the new <a>Legislative Assembly</a>, with <a>Premier</a> <a>Alexander C. Rutherford</a> as its sponsor.
</p>
<p>The governance was modelled on Ontario's University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The location of the university was to be decided along the same lines as that of <a>Saskatchewan</a>.
(The province of Saskatchewan shares the same founding date as Alberta, 1905.)
Saskatchewan had to please two competing cities when deciding the location of its capital city and provincial university.
Thus, <a>Regina</a> was designated the provincial capital and <a>Saskatoon</a> received the provincial university, the <a>University of Saskatchewan</a>.
The same heated wrangling over the location of the provincial capital also took place in Alberta between the cities of <a>Calgary</a> and Edmonton.
It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.
By 1920, the university had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy).
It awarded a range of degrees: <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> (BA), <a>Bachelor of Science</a> (BSc), <a>Bachelor of Science in Agriculture</a> (BSA), <a>Bachelor of Laws</a> (LLB), <a>Bachelor of Pharmacy</a> (PhmB), <a>Bachelor of Divinity</a> (BD), <a>Master of Arts</a> (MA), <a>Master of Science</a> (MSc), and <a>Doctor of Laws</a> (LLD).
There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.</p>
<h3>Newspapers</h3>
<p>The university has two main newspapers, <em>Folio</em> and <em><a>The Gateway</a></em>.
<em>Folio</em> is the official newspaper published by &quot;Marketing &amp; Communications&quot; every two weeks from September to June.
<em>The Gateway</em> is the official student newspaper.
Fully autonomous, it publishes &quot;most Tuesdays and Thursdays&quot;.</p>
<p>The university also has a monthly student newspaper, the Dagligtale, published at Augustana Campus in <a>Camrose, Alberta</a>.</p>
<h3>Radio</h3>
<p>In 1927, the university established the <a>CKUA</a> Educational <a>radio station</a>.</p>
<h3>Book publishing</h3>
<p>The <a>University of Alberta Press</a>, which was founded in 1969, concentrates on western Canadian history, general science and ecology.
The <a>University of Alberta Press</a> publishes an average of between 20 and 30 books per year, often accepting submissions from across <a>Canada</a> for over 50% of the publications.
Their current active title listing has more than 150 books, as of 2007.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The university has several distributed campus facilities including, other than the Main Campus, two auxiliary satellites; Campus Saint-Jean in east Edmonton, and Augustana Campus in <a>Camrose</a>.
An extensively renovated and refurbished <a>Hudson's Bay</a> department store in downtown Edmonton, renamed Enterprise Square, serves as a campus for adult students belonging to the Faculty of Extension.
Notably the university owns a set of large parcels of undeveloped land (currently used as an experimental farm) slightly south of the main campus, called South Campus, in which an entire new university complex will gradually be constructed of similar magnitude to the Main Campus.</p>
<h3>North Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|University, river valley, and downtown Edmonton</a>Also known as Main Campus, the North Campus is the original location of the University of Alberta.
It is located on the southern banks of the <a>North Saskatchewan River</a>.
It has 145 buildings on 92 hectares of land.
&lt;!--this needs to be updated--&gt;A satellite view of the main campus can be seen on <a>Google maps</a>.</p>
<p>Architect <a>Barton Myers</a> completed the long-range campus plan in 1969 and continued as a planner for the University until 1978.</p>
<h3>Campus Saint-Jean</h3>
<p>The <a>Campus Saint-Jean</a> is a <a>francophone</a> campus located 5&nbsp;km east of the main campus, in <a>Bonnie Doon</a>.
It is the only <a>French</a>-language university campus west of <a>Manitoba</a>.
Due to increasing enrolment, the Campus Saint-Jean is currently undergoing expansion, acquiring new laboratory and classroom spaces.
Students at Campus Saint-Jean currently may pursue Bachelor's degrees in the sciences or arts, or complete their first year of <a>Engineering</a>, after which they often transfer to the University of Alberta's main campus.</p>
<h3>Augustana Campus</h3>
<p>The <a>Augustana Campus</a> is located in <a>Camrose</a>, a small city in rural Alberta about 100&nbsp;km southeast of Edmonton.
In 2004, the former <a>Augustana University College</a> in Camrose merged with the University of Alberta, thus creating the new satellite Augustana Campus.
Students enrolled at the Augustana Campus currently may pursue four-year Bachelor's degrees in arts,  sciences, or music.</p>
<h3>Enterprise Square</h3>
<p>Enterprise Square opened for business January 15, 2008 on the north side of the <a>North Saskatchewan</a> river in downtown <a>Edmonton</a>.
It is located in the historical building previously occupied by the <a>Hudson's Bay Company</a>.
The building underwent major renovations.
Currently, Enterprise Square houses the Faculty of Extension, the professional development activities of the <a>Alberta School of Business</a>, the Alberta Business Family Institute, and the Design Gallery.
It is also the new home of the University of Alberta Alumni Association.</p>
<h3>Future campuses</h3>
<p>The University of Alberta has future plans for one more Edmonton campus.
The South Campus is much larger in terms of land area and located two kilometres to the south of the Main Campus, with a convenient high speed link via <a>Light Rail Transit</a>.
<a>The transit station</a> is near <strong>Foote Field</strong> and <strong>Saville Sports Centre</strong>, forming a natural gateway to the new campus architectural model.
Since South Campus LRT opened in April 2009, the U of A became the only university in Canada with four LRT/Subway stations on its campuses (Along with <a>University</a>, <a>Health Sciences/Jubilee</a>, and <a>Bay/Enterprise Square</a> stations).
Preliminary long range development thinking for South Campus implies it may become an expanding academic and research extension of the Main Campus, with rapid development over the next few decades.
New architectural guidelines, differing from the Main Campus might encourage a somewhat more consistent, high quality, aesthetic architectural style.
As there is a large expanse of land available, significant green space will be incorporated and is expected to increase due to added state-of-the-art research and teaching capacity.</p>
<h3>Centre for Interdisciplinary Science</h3>
<p>One of the major projects underway is the construction of a new $400 million state-of-the-art facility, scheduled for completion in January 2011 and to be known as the Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS), a facility for interdisciplinary research groups, as well as the Department of Physics.
Three buildings - V-Wing (a large one-floor building composed of 10 lecture halls, of which two will remain), the Avadh Bhatia Physics Building (a six-storey building formerly housing the Department of Physics offices and laboratories), and the old Centre for Subatomic Research - have been demolished to make way for CCIS.
Many of the classes and labs that were held in these buildings have now been relocated to other new or recently renovated buildings, such as the building now known as the Civil Electrical Building (CEB), which currently holds the Department of Physics offices, undergraduate labs, and classrooms, plus the first phase of the CCIS facilities which presently house the Condensed Matter labs.</pre>
<h3>The Edmonton Clinic</h3>
<p>Construction on two new buildings totalling $909 million 170,000 m&#x00b2; multidisciplinary health science facility, surrounding the Health Sciences LRT Station, started in early 2008.
The Edmonton Clinic North being built by the University of Alberta is slated for completion in 2011.
The Edmonton Clinic South being built by <a>Alberta Health Services</a> is slated for completion in 2012.
The <a>Edmonton Clinic</a> (formerly the Health Science Ambulatory Learning Centre) is a joint project with Alberta Health Services, and consists of two separate buildings.
Edmonton Clinic South, a 9-story building, will focus on patient care and house most of the medical and dental clinics, while Edmonton Clinic North is a 6-story building that will focus on research and education currently held at the university.</p>
<h3>Health Research Innovation Facility (HRIF)</h3>
<p>Two new $300 million buildings adjacent to the Heritage Medical Research Centre building on the main campus will contribute to research by allowing the university to hire over 100 additional biomedical and health researchers, this is projected to result in a doubling of research funding by 2014.</p>
<p>Health Research Innovation Facility (HRIF) is a translational research centre designed to create an environment for innovative &quot;bench-to-bedside&quot; health research by increasing interaction between researchers and clinicians focused on common medical issues.
A total of 65,000 square meters gross area constructed on two sites.</p>
<p><strong>HRIF West</strong></p>
<p>The hub of the complex is HRIF West, an 8-story building which provides the main entrance to the complex and becomes the critical link between MSB and HMRC.
The atrium connection between MSB and HRIF West provides an impressive public venue for the entire facility.
The large Lecture Theatre, Teaching and Learning Centre and food service kiosks are located with the atrium which also supports interaction between researchers as well as important links to the existing circulation systems.</p>
<p><strong>HRIF East</strong></p>
<p>HRIF East provides access to the complex from the south and east as well as to the Alberta Diabetes Research Institute (&quot;ADRI&quot;) which will occupy several floors within this 9-stoery building.
Both the east and west buildings of HRIF are linked at every floor to HMRC with the exception of Level 1 of HRIF West.
HRIF West is linked to MSB through the atrium and bridge connections at several levels.
In addition HRIF East connects directly to NANUC as well as the new parkade to the south.
Completing the complex, the Zeidler (GI) Building and Clinical Training Centre (&quot;CTC&quot;) is also connected to the parkade and directly linked to Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre (&quot;WCMHSC&quot;).
A Bio-Hazard Level 3 laboratory is located in the basement of the east building, one of the largest one in Canada at over  over nine stories.</p>
<h2>Student life and Residences</h2>
<p><a>thumb|South side of the Students' Union Building.</a></p>
<h3>Student Bodies</h3>
<p> In 1946 the university student council met to consider possible blueprints for a new building, including a large auditorium, during a time when veterans were returning to complete their interrupted studies.
The new building was financed by a series of mechanisms, and the completed structure, after a series of additions, now with the large auditorium, named after Myer Horowitz, opened in 1967.
</p>
<p>The Students' Union Building (SUB) has been expanded twice since its original construction.
It holds a number of services and businesses owned and operated by the Students' Union as well as services owned and operated by the University of Alberta, including the University Bookstore.</p>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate students' organizations are registered with the Students Union (SU) and Graduate Students Association (GSA) of the university.</p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p>The University of Alberta offers a wide range of residences on its campuses.</p>
<p>While a majority of the university's students live off-campus, a significant number of students from outside Edmonton in early years of their post secondary education opt to live in residences operated by the university's Residence Services.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a>Lister Centre</a></strong> is a large residence complex, located in four towers, mainly occupied by first and second year students.
It provides a full care boarding package, with hospitality programs to help integrate new students into university life.
The complex offers a large number of furnished single and double <a>dormitory</a> style rooms with common kitchens and living areas.
There is a large scale cafeteria, in the central building of the complex.
It is the largest residence on campus with a population of 1800.</li>
<li><strong>HUB International</strong> houses a combination of international students and Canadians with a selection of very high quality bachelor suites and also single, double and quadruple bedroom apartments.
The  design, by architect <a>Barton Myers</a>, became a prototype for cold Canadian climates, with an interior corridor housing businesses and restaurants that can be viewed from the apartments above, giving it the feel of a residential street.
It is the second largest residence on campus with a population of 850.
The official student group for HUB Residents is the HUB Community Association (HCA)</li>
  <li><strong>International House</strong> is a new residence designed for international students and a few Canadian students, interested in living with international students.
It offers modern well equipped single bedrooms with common kitchens and living spaces, both furnished and unfurnished.</li>
<li><strong>Newton Place</strong> is a high rise offering older students an apartment-style facility.</li>
<li><strong>East Campus Village</strong> comprises houses and walk-up townhouses, offering older and married students a modern multi-room facility.</li>
<li><strong>Michener Park</strong>.
Offers older students another apartment-style facility.</li>
<li><strong><a>St.
Joseph's College Residence</a></strong> operates an all-male residence, independent of the university's official residence service.</li>
<li><strong>La R&#x00e9;sidence Saint-Jean</strong> operates a modern apartment style, <a>French language</a> oriented, residence on Campus Saint-Jean, about six kilometers east of the Main Campus.</li>
<li><strong>Augustana Faculty Residences</strong> comprise two distinct compounds.
The 300-room First Year residence complex is similar in style to, although much smaller than, Lister Centre, and is composed entirely of double rooms.
Across a small ravine from the rest of the campus there is another compound of seven smaller buildings (six residences and a common area) known collectively as the &quot;Ravine Complex&quot; that house almost exclusively upperclassmen.
The Augustana Faculty is the only faculty in the University with a residence requirement whereby, with certain exceptions, all students are expected to spend their first year in residence on campus.</li>
</ul>
