U.S. President <a>James A. Garfield</a> was a student, instructor, and principal of the institution while it was still the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute.
Today the College is known for its unique <a>academic calendar</a> and for its <a>study abroad</a> programs.
Hiram College is accredited by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
Hiram is listed in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Founding and History</h2>

<p>The Disciples of Christ founded the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute as a nonsectarian, coeducational preparatory school in 1849.
Hiram was chosen as the site of the institution because this area of the <a>Western Reserve</a> seemed to be &quot;healthful and free of distractions.&quot;</p>

<p>The first principal of the Institute (equivalent to today's president of the College) was Amos Sutton Hayden (1813&#x2013;1880), who served from 1850 until 1857.
Almeda A. Booth (1823&#x2013;1875) served as principal of the Ladies' department and as a faculty member of English, Classics, and Mathematics from 1851 until 1866.
She was one of <a>Garfield</a>'s more influential teachers and remained close friends with him until her death.
Garfield was also mentored by <a>Platt Rogers Spencer</a>, a prominent writing scholar.
Garfield, himself, after completing his degree at <a>Williams</a>, returned to Hiram to join the faculty in 1856, as a classical scholar teaching Greek and Latin, along with such subjects as mathematics and geology.
In 1857, he became principal of the Institute.
Although he left Hiram in 1861 to take up the <a>Civil War</a> command of Company A of the <a>42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry</a>, a regiment recruited from Hiram, Garfield's name appeared in the Institute's catalogs until 1863.
These centers serve as forums for confronting various challenges encountered by society.
They bring to campus notable scholars and authors and create research opportunities for students.</p>

Hiram used to compete in men's and women's tennis, but no longer does so at the varsity level.
It has been rumored that Hiram would begin competition in both men's and women's <a>lacrosse</a>, but no timetable has been set for the creation of these teams.
Among the most popular club sports at Hiram is men's <a>rugby</a>, which competes against other area colleges and in the annual alumni rugby match.</p>
<p>The football team snapped a 26-game winless streak in 2008, recording 3 victories to finish in seventh place in the NCAC.
Men's soccer was seeded #2 entering the 2008 NCAC tournament, but lost in the semifinal game to #3 <a>Wittenberg</a>.

<h2>Student organizations</h2>
<h3>Association for Computing Machinery(ACM)</h3>
<p>The Hiram College undergraduate chapter of the <a>Association for Computing Machinery</a> is a club for technology enthusiasts and students with interest in computer science.
Its activities include participation in the ACM Programming Contest, the regular sponsorship of computer games playable over Hiram's local area network (LAN) and the hosting of speakers of interest to the technology community.
The Hiram College Association for Computing Machinery meets periodically throughout the academic year.</p>
<h3>Greek clubs</h3>
<p>In order to preserve the egalitarian character of the college, it was decided that Hiram would have no national fraternities or sororities.
There are, however, Greek social clubs.
No affiliations with any national fraternities are intended or implied.
Greek social clubs at Hiram are restricted from using the same Greek letters as any national organization.</p>
<p>Established in 1929, Phi Gamma Epsilon (or &quot;Phi Gams&quot;) is currently the oldest existing Greek social club at Hiram College.
Probation threatened the existence of the club in the mid 1980s, but the group survived and now claims to boast a strong, visible presence.
The Phi Gams have sponsored a number of events, including an annual Toga Party and Spaghetti Dinner.
The group's mascot, Buck PhiGam, is a Viking whose likeness is represented in a painting the group believes was created in the 1920s.
Phi Beta Gamma, their sister group, often co-sponsors a number of these events.
<a>thumb|250px|right|The Kennedy Center</a> Another one of the social clubs at Hiram College is Delta Chi Lambda.
The Delta Chi Lambdas is made up of all female students.
This club was once disbanded but now is back.
It is currently one of the largest Greek social clubs at Hiram.
The brother group is Lambda Lambda.
After a shortage of members, they are currently rebuilding their program.</p>
<h3><a>Kennedy Center Programming Board</a></h3>
<p>The Kennedy Center Programming Board (KCPB) is one of Hiram's largest student organizations.
Although its establishment is unknown, yearbook pictures of events and members can be found as far back as the early 1970s.
KCPB is responsible for programming student activities on campus.
KCPB receives its funding from the student activity fund which each student pays into each year.
Some of the annually notable programs are Homecoming, Spring Fest, Campus Day, Game Room Tournaments, and Coffee Houses.
In 2006/2007, Student Senate created a new position, Vice President of Activities.
This person serves as the chairman/chairwoman of KCPB.
This merger allowed Student Senate to relinquish its programming sector and focus on student and college issues.

<h3>Terrier Productions</h3>
<p>Terrier Productions is Hiram College's film and video production club.
They tape events on campus, create promotional advertisements for other clubs, and work on other creative projects&#x2014;including talk shows, music videos, student body polls, and short movies.
This group broadcasts over a local, closed-network cable channel and Youtube [<a>http://youtube.com/terrierproductions</a>].</p>
<h3>Terrier Sound Marching Band</h3>
<p>Hiram College created its first marching band in Spring of 2006 emerging from an already established pep band.
After intense fund raising, the students raised just over $10,000 to purchase marching band music and instruments in just less than six months.
The first marching band in Hiram College history sprang from student initiative.
The Terrier Sound Marching Band (TSMB) made its first official appearance at the Hiram&#x2019;s season-opening football game against Carnegie Mellon University on Saturday, September 2, 2006.
In the summer of 2007, the marching band purchased its first official marching band uniforms after a generous donation.
The band can be seen performing on the steps of the Kennedy Center (Student Union) before the home football games.</p>
