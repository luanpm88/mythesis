<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was established in 1976 from the merger of Richmond College (opened in 1965) and Staten Island Community College (opened 1956).
Richmond College had been threatened with closure because of <a>New York City</a>'s financial crisis, while the older school, because of its status as a <a>community college</a>, received state support.
The merger was particularly logical since the community college offered two year degrees, while Richmond College was an &quot;upper divisional&quot; college (the third in the nation) that offered degrees to those in their third and fourth years of schooling.</p>
<p>The College of Staten Island has been located on the grounds of the former <a>Willowbrook State School</a> since 1993.
It is the largest campus, in terms of physical size, in New York City.
Before the relocation to Willowbrook, the college had a split campus, located at the former Staten Island Community College (in <a>Sunnyside</a>, on <a>Todt Hill</a>) and Richmond College (in <a>St.
George</a>).</p>
<p>The first president of the college, Dr. Edmond Volpe, an American literature scholar, retired in 1994, after having successfully handled the merger of the two colleges and the unification of the two campuses.
He was succeeded by Dr. Marlene Springer, as the second president of the college, an English and American literature scholar, under whose leadership the College improved academic standards, introduced two doctoral programs and several master's programs, raised the level of the faculty, added research institutes, and introduced an Honors College, the Verrazano School, and the CSI High School for International Studies.
She retired in August 2007 and was succeeded by Tom&#x00e1;s D. Morales, who was awarded an Ed.D. in Educational Administration from SUNY-Albany in 1998, as the third president of the college.
He has arranged for a free bus from the Staten Island ferry to the Willowbrook campus.</p>
<h2>The Campus</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Completed in 1994, the  campus of CSI/CUNY is the largest site for a college in New York City.
Set in a park-like landscape, the campus is centrally located on <a>Staten Island</a>.
Mature trees and woodlands, flowering trees and ornamental plantings, fields and outdoor athletic facilities, the great lawn, sculpture, and seating areas create a rural oasis in an urban setting.
In 2005 an academic building on the campus was converted into the CSI High School for International Studies; the first senior class to graduate from the high school did so in 2009.
The high school has since moved off-site to a new, purpose-built facility.</p>
<p>Twenty one new and renovated <a>neo-Georgian</a> buildings serve as classrooms, laboratories, facilities buildings and offices.
The academic buildings house 300 classrooms, laboratories and instructional spaces, study lounges, department and program offices, and faculty offices.</p>
<p>North and South Academic Quadrangles are connected by the Alumni Walk, with the Library and Campus Center as focal points.
The Center for the Arts is located midway between the Quadrangles at the fountain plaza.
The Sports and Recreation Center and the athletic fields are located near the main entrance to the campus.</p>
<p>Sixteen works of art, a permanent collection of works either commissioned or purchased through the Art Acquisitions Program of the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, are installed throughout the campus.
The artists and their free-standing sculptures and reliefs are: <a>Vincenzo Amato</a>, <em>Body of Hector/Glaucus</em>; Miriam Bloom, <em>Shooliloo</em>; Fritz Bultman, <em>Garden at Nightfall</em> (extended loan); <a>Chryssa</a>, <em>Untitled</em>; Lucille Friedland, <em>Big Stride</em> (gift of the artist); <a>Red Grooms</a>, <em>Marathon</em>; Sarah Haviland, <em>Staten Island Arch</em>; Jon Isherwood, <em>Borromini's Task</em>; Zero Higashida, <em>Maquette for a Small Universe</em>; <a>Valerie Jaudon</a>, <em>Untitled</em>; Niki Ketchman, <em>Red Inside</em>; Win Knowlton, <em>Ellipse</em>; Mark Mennin, <em>Torak</em>; Don Porcaro, <em>Moon Marker</em>; and Hans Van de Bovenkamp, <em>Stele in the Wind</em>.</p>
