<p></p>
<p>The <strong>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</strong>  is a <a>Flemish</a> <a>university</a> located in <a>Brussels</a>, <a>Belgium</a>.
It has two campuses referred to as <a>Etterbeek</a> and <a>Jette</a>.</p>
<p>The university's name is sometimes abbreviated by &quot;VUB&quot; or translated to &quot;<a>Free University of Brussels</a>&quot;.
However, it is an official policy of the university not to use abbreviations or translations of its name,  because of possible confusion with another university that has the same translated name: the <a>French</a>-speaking <a>Universit&#x00e9; Libre de Bruxelles</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel was formed by the splitting in 1970 of the same Universit&#x00e9; Libre de Bruxelles, which was founded in 1834 by the Flemish-Brussels lawyer <a>Pierre-Th&#x00e9;odore Verhaegen</a>.
He wanted to establish a university <a>independent</a> from state and church, where <a>academic freedom</a> would be prevalent.
This is today still reflected in the university's <a>motto</a> <em>Scientia vincere tenebras</em>, or <em>Conquering darkness by science</em>, and in its more recent slogan <em>Redelijk eigenzinnig</em> <img>, or <em>Reasonably opinionated</em>.
Accordingly, the university is <a>pluralistic</a> &mdash; it is open to all students on the basis of equality regardless of their ideological, political, cultural or social background &mdash; and it is managed using <a>democratic</a> structures, which means that all members &mdash; from students to faculty &mdash; participate in the decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The university is organised into 8 <a>faculties</a> that accomplish the three central missions of the university: <a>education</a>, <a>research</a>, and <a>service</a> to the community.
The faculties cover a broad range of fields of knowledge including the <a>natural science</a>s, <a>classics</a>, life sciences, <a>social sciences</a>, <a>humanities</a>, and <a>engineering</a>.
The university provides bachelor, master, and doctoral education to about 8,000 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students.
It is also a strongly research-oriented institute, which has led to its top-214 position among universities worldwide.
Its research articles are on average more cited than articles by any other <a>Flemish university</a>.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution.
The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community &mdash; including <a>faculty staff</a>, <a>researcher</a>s, personnel, and students.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Faculty of Law and Criminology</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Economic, Social, and Political Sciences</a> and the <a>Solvay Business School</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Arts and Philosophy</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Engineering</a></li>
  <li><a>Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These faculties benefit a wide <a>autonomy</a> over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university's statutes and must be approved by the central administration.</p>
<p>The <a>central administration</a> is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder.
All programmes are taught in <a>Dutch</a>, but 59 are also taught in <a>English</a>.
In agreement with the <a>Bologna process</a>, the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system.
It therefore issues four types of <a>degrees</a>: <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a>, master after master's, and <a>doctoral</a> degrees.</p>
<p><a>Admission</a> to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice.
However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor&#x2019;s degree is required to subscribe to a master&#x2019;s programme, and a master&#x2019;s degree is required to subscribe to a master after master&#x2019;s or doctoral programme.
An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government.
Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.</p>
<p>The <a>academic year</a> is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June.
Students take <a>exams</a> in January and June.
Apart from the <a>Christmas</a> and <a>Easter</a> holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the <a>Summer holiday</a>s from July to September.</p>
<p>The university has implemented several <a>quality control</a> schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes.
Each semester, all students <a>evaluate</a> the courses they have followed.
All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees.
Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the <a>Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie</a>, an independent accreditation organisation charged with the <a>accreditation</a> of higher education programmes in both <a>Flanders</a> and the <a>Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment of a university in Brussels</h3>
<p>The history of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is closely linked with that of <a>Belgium</a> itself.
At the time of the declaration of independence of Belgium in 1830, three state universities existed in the cities of <a>Ghent</a>, <a>Li&#x00e8;ge</a> and <a>Leuven</a>.
In Brussels, the <a>capital</a> of the newly established country, a university was lacking.
A group of leading <a>intellectual</a>s in the fields of arts, science, and education &mdash; amongst whom <a>Auguste Baron</a> and the astronomer and mathematician <a>Adolphe Quetelet</a> &mdash; pointed out the advantages of a university to the new capital and country.
The liberals in Belgium strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution.
At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the <a>freemasonic</a> lodge &quot;Les Amis Philantropes&quot;, as had a large number of other intellectuals with enlightened ideas.
Baron was able to convince <a>Pierre-Th&#x00e9;odore Verhaegen</a>, the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university.
On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.
After its establishment, the Universit&#x00e9; Libre de Bruxelles faced difficult times, since it did receive no <a>subsidies</a> or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means.
Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarized in a speech to <a>King Leopold I</a>: the principle of <em>free inquiry</em> and academic freedom uninfluenced by any <a>political</a> or <a>religious</a> <a>authority</a>.
On 1 October 1969, the university was finally split in two sister institutions: the French-speaking Universit&#x00e9; Libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
This splitting became official by the law of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian parliament, by which the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universit&#x00e9; Libre de Bruxelles became two separate <a>legal entities</a>.</p>
<h2>Basic principles</h2>
<p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an <a>open</a>, <a>tolerant</a>, and <a>pluralistic</a> university.
Its central principles are the <a>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and in particular the principle of <em>free inquiry</em> for the progress of humanity.
The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Statutes&quot;/&gt; The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes.
The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the <a>French</a> <a>mathematician</a> and <a>philosopher</a> <a>Henri Poincar&#x00e9;</a>: <a>right|225px|Seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a> </pre>
<p>This principle is also reflected in the university's <a>motto</a> <em>Scientia vincere tenebras</em>, or <em>Conquering darkness by science</em>, and in its seal.
The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar's wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the <a>Prince of Orange</a>) <a>escutcheon</a> in the <a>emblem</a>, referring to the struggle of the Protestant <a>Geuzen</a> and the <a>Prince of Orange</a> against the oppressive Spanish rule and the <a>Inquisition</a> in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Another basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel &mdash; also incorporated in the university's statutes &mdash; is that the institution must be managed according to the model of <a>democracy</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Statutes&quot;/&gt; Practically, this means that all members of the academic community &mdash; <a>faculty staff</a>, researchers, personnel, and students &mdash; are represented in all governing bodies.
In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management.
This principles must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.</p>
<h2>Campus and facilities</h2>
<p>[[Image:VUB campus Etterbeek.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|[[Etterbeek]] campus]] Most of the faculties are located on the <a>Etterbeek</a> campus (which is actually located on the territory of the neighbouring borough of <a>Elsene</a>), it is the livelier of the two campuses.
The activities mainly take place in the numerous auditoriums and labs.
In addition, there is a modern sports centre with various rooms for sporting activities, a football pitch encircled by a running track and an on-campus swimming pool.
For eating out, there is not just the student restaurant, but also some snack bars ('t Complex, Opinio, Kultuurkaffee), the last one also organising free concerts and events and being a full-fledged concert venue during the evening/night, offering the university a cultural scene.</p>
<p>The campus in <a>Jette</a> is also a fully-fledged campus.
The University Hospital (UZ Brussel) is in the vicinity.

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Every student that enrolls at the VUB, automatically becomes a member of the Brussels Studentengenootschap (BSG - <em>Brussels Student Society</em>), unless they refuse to be.
This means that every student has the right to vote and participate in the annual elections for the BSG committee.
The BSG is the umbrella organisation for all other student organizations and acts as the defender of the moral interests of the students.
Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the <a>ULB</a>, they organise the annual <a>St V</a> memorial.</p>
<p>These are the student organizations at the VUB:</p>
