<h2>History</h2>
<p>The seeds of WJU's founding were planted as early as the 19th century.
Bishop Richard Whelan, leader of the <a>Diocese of Wheeling</a>, lobbied the Society of Jesus to establish a university in the burgeoning city.
Over a century later, Whelan's original vision came to fruition.
After a donor, Sara Tracy, left her estate to the diocese, it was able to purchase land from the neighboring Mt.
De Chantal Visitation Academy.
Wheeling Jesuit University, then Wheeling College, was founded through a partnership of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston with the Maryland Society of Jesus.
Ground was broken on November 24, 1953, and the college was officially opened September 26, 1955.
Overcoming the difficulties of temporary facilities and a faculty of just twelve Jesuit priests and four lay professors, the school has grown considerably.</p>
<p>For the 1987-1988 school year, the university became Wheeling Jesuit College, and in the 1990s, gained university status.</p>
<p>On October 22, 2010, the university announced the selection of Richard A. Beyer as its ninth president.
Beyer is the first non-Jesuit president to lead WJU.
Beyer takes office effective January 2, 2011.</p>

Byrd's presentation was available online and streamed to schools across the country.</p>
<h2>Robert C. Byrd National Technology Transfer Center</h2>
<p>In 1989, the U.S. Congress established the National Technology Transfer Center to link U.S. industry with federal labs and universities possessing the research technologies, facilities, and personnel required to turn research efforts into products.
With operations in Wheeling, W.V., and Alexandria, VA., the National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC) is committed to developing partnerships among industry, academia, and government agencies.</p>
<p>NTTC focuses on providing essential services nationwide for the commercialization of technologies developed by federal agencies and other clients.

<p>The NTTC's client base ranges from small companies to Fortune 500 firms as well as government, corporate, and academic partners.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>Though WJU talked with the former Mt.
De Chantal Visitation Academy to rent, and eventually purchase the 160 year-old school's facilities and use them as classrooms, the facility's purchase by <a>Wheeling Hospital</a> seems to have ended such discussion.
The school hoped to expand its graduate and health science programs, in addition to relocating the school's tutoring program (The ARC, or Academic Resource Center) to the building.</p>
