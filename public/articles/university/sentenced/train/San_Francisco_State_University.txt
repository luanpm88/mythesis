<h2>Mascot</h2>
<p>The school first adopted their mascot, the Gator, in 1931.
After a call for a mascot by the student newspaper the <em>Bay Leaf</em>, students suggested the &quot;alligator&quot; for its strength and steadfastness.
The student also suggested the spelling &quot;Golden Gaters,&quot; with an &quot;e,&quot; in reference to the <a>Golden Gate</a>.
Students voted in favor of the name, but after numerous &quot;misspellings&quot; by the newspaper, the use of Gator, with an &quot;o,&quot; stuck.
</p>
<p>The team was called the Golden Gaters until the late 1940s.
At that time, they began having two live alligators at football games, Oogee (oo-gee) and Ougee (aug-gee).
The name was changed to the Golden Gators.
The alligator mascots were dropped shortly and Golden was dropped from the name in the early 1970s.</p>

<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>Controversies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Student protests of <a>military recruiter</a>s on campus (in which the administration defended its actions), and confrontations between students with differing views on the <a>Iraq War</a> (in which the administration defended its actions again).</li>
<li>The <a>National Lawyers Guild</a> charged that the university violated due process rights of campus anti-war activists.</li>
<li>The Campus Antiwar Network (CAN) has charged that the university violated due process rights of campus anti-war activists.</li>
<li>A near-riot occurred on May 7, 2002, when a pro-Palestinian group attended a pro-Israel demonstration on campus.
The pro-Israel students say that the Palestinian supporters chanted anti-semitic epithets at them, such as &quot;Hitler should have finished the job.&quot;
The pro-Palestinian group say the pro-Israelis started the conflict by calling them terrorists and using epithets such as &quot;camel jockey.&quot;
No violence occurred, but campus and city police were called in to defuse the situation.</li>
<li>In 1994 a mural depicting Malcolm X was painted on the student union building, commissioned by the Pan-African Student Union and African Student Alliance.
The mural's border contained yellow <a>Stars of David</a> and dollar signs mingled with skulls and crossbones and near the words &quot;African Blood.&quot;
The next week, after demonstrations on both sides, the school administration had the mural painted over, and subsequently sand blasted.
Two years later a new Malcolm X mural was painted, without the controversial symbols.</li>
