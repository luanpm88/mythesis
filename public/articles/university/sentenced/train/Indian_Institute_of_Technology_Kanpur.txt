<p>The <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</strong> () (also known as <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong> or <strong>IITK</strong>) is an <a>Indian Institutes of Technology</a>, set up in <a>Kanpur</a> in 1959.
IIT Kanpur has grown into one of the top technological institutes in India&lt;ref name=&quot;Survey&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, primarily focused on research in engineering and science, and the teaching of undergraduates.
IIT Kanpur has a  campus of 4.3 square kilometres, just north-west of the city.
Among all IITs, IIT Kanpur has the second largest campus (1,055 acres), first being <a>IIT Kharagpur</a>.</p>
<p>The campus is a self-contained community, with residences for students, faculty, and staff.
There is a hospital, sports fields, and a swimming pool.
Schools are provided for campus children, and an 'Opportunity school' supported by alumni, serves the children of local day and occasional workers.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>IIT Kanpur was established by an Act of <a>Parliament</a> in 1959.
The institute was started in December 1959 in a room in the canteen building of the <a>Harcourt Butler Technological Institute</a> at Agricultural Gardens in Kanpur.
In 1963, the institute moved to its present location, on the <a>Grand Trunk Road</a> near the village of Kalyanpur in Kanpur district.
</p>
<p>During the first ten years of its existence, IIT Kanpur benefited from the Kanpur Indo-American Programme (KIAP), where a consortium of nine US universities (namely <a>M.I.T</a>, <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, <a>California Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>Carnegie Institute of Technology</a>, <a>University of Michigan</a>, <a>Ohio State University</a>, <a>Case Institute of Technology</a> and <a>Purdue University</a>) helped set up the research laboratories and academic programmes.&lt;ref
name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first Director of the Institute was <a>Dr.
P. K. Kelkar</a> (after whom the Central Library was renamed in 2002).</p>
<p>Under the guidance of economist <a>John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, IIT Kanpur was the first institute in India to offer Computer Science education.
The earliest computer courses were started at IIT Kanpur in August 1963 on an <a>IBM 1620</a> system.
The initiative for computer education came from the Electrical Engineering department, then under the chairmanship of Prof. <a>H.K. Kesavan</a>, who was concurrently the chairman of Electrical Engineering and head of the Computer Centre.
Prof. Harry Huskey of the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, who preceded Dr. Kesavan, was instrumental in providing the impetus for the computer activity at IIT-Kanpur.
In 1971, the institute initiated an independent academic program in Computer Science and Engineering, leading to M.Tech.
and Ph.D. degrees.</p>
<p>In 1972 the KIAP program ended, in part because of tensions due to the U.S. support of Pakistan.
Government funding was also reduced as a reaction to the sentiment that the IIT's were contributing to the brain drain.
Since then IIT Kanpur has increased collaboration with industry and has achieved a reasonable level of stability, especially since it is recognized that India now profits from job creation in the industries that it supports.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|IIT Kanpur Faculty Building</a></p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>Undergraduate courses in engineering are four year Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) and five5 year Dual Degree Programs.
The Dual Degree program leads to a B.Tech with an M.Tech degree.
The institute also offers 5 years Integrated <a>Master of Science</a> degrees in the areas of Pure and Applied Sciences and a program in Economics.
The Economics program bridges the gap between students of Engineering and Humanities, with the students of the program having courses in Mathematics, Computer Science and other engineering and pure science courses in addition to pure economics courses.</p>
<h3>Postgraduate</h3>
<p>Postgraduate courses in Engineering offer Master of Technology (M.Tech) and Ph.D. degrees.
The institute also offers M.B.A. (2 years), M.Sc.
(2 years) and M.Des degrees.
Admissions to M. Tech is made once a year through <a>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</a>.
Admissions to the M.B.A. program are accomplished through the <a>Joint Management Entrance Test</a>, held yearly, and followed by a Group Discussion/Personal Interview process.</p>

  <li><strong><a>Jugnu (satellite)</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The students of IIT Kanpur made a nano satellite called Jugnu, This small satellite was given by president <a>Pratibha Patil</a> to <a>ISRO</a> for launch. .
Jugnu is an Indian technology demonstration and remote sensing satellite which will be operated by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
It is a nanosatellite which will be used to provide data for agriculture and disaster monitoring.
It is a 3-kilogram (6.6 lb) spacecraft, which measures 34 centimetres (13 in) in length by 10 centimetres (3.9 in) in height and width.
Its development programme cost around 25 million rupee.
It has a design life of one year.
Jugnu's primary instrument is the Micro Imaging System, a near infrared camera which will be used to observe vegetation.
It also carries a GPS receiver to aid tracking, and is intended to demonstrate a microelectromechanical inertial measurement unit.
Jugnu will be launched into low Earth orbit by a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle flying from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
The launch is currently scheduled to occur during 2011</p>
