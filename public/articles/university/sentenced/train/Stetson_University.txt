</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to <a>Gilbert Lycan</a>, a Stetson history professor who wrote the university's official centennial history in 1983, Stetson University is Florida's first university, public or private.
Stetson University was founded in 1883 by <a>Henry Addison DeLand</a>, a <a>New York</a> philanthropist, as DeLand Academy.
In 1887, the <a>Florida Legislature</a> enacted the Charter of DeLand University as an independent institution of higher learning.
<a>Rollins College</a> was founded and chartered in 1885, thus making it the oldest recognized college, public or private.
</p>
<p>DeLand University's name was changed in 1889 to honor hat manufacturer <a>John B. Stetson</a>, a benefactor of the university, who served with town founder Henry A. DeLand and others as a founding trustee of the university.</p>
<p>Stetson University was affiliated with the Florida Baptist Convention until the early 1990s, when the university and convention ended their relationship.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|DeLand Hall</a> <a>thumb|Elizabeth Hall</a> <a>thumb|Chaudoin Hall</a> The university's College of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Business Administration, School of Music and most graduate programs are housed at the historic DeLand campus, located just north of the downtown area of <a>DeLand, Florida</a>.
More than 60 undergraduate majors and minors are offered.
</p>
<p>Stetson's historic campus is just north of the downtown area of DeLand, roughly halfway between <a>Orlando</a> and <a>Daytona Beach, Florida</a>.
The  campus is nationally designated by the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> as the <a>Stetson University Campus Historic District</a> for Florida's oldest collection of education-related buildings.
DeLand Hall, which houses the Office of the President and the offices of other administrators, was constructed in 1884 and is the oldest building in Florida in continuous use for higher education.
</p>
<p>In 2003, the Lynn Business Center &mdash; housing much of the university's School of Business &mdash; was Florida's first <a>green building</a> certified by the <a>U.S. Green Building Council</a>.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hall, named after <a>John B. Stetson</a>'s wife, houses a number of departments in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.
The School of Music performs in Lee Chapel in the south of the building.
The <a>cupola</a> atop Elizabeth Hall &#x2014; modeled after the one on <a>Independence Hall</a> in <a>Philadelphia</a> &#x2014; is used as the official symbol of the undergraduate campus.</p>
<p>In 2010, Stetson became a pet-friendly campus,  and the university also invested $6.5 million to renew landscaping in the campus core, upgrade classrooms and add energy-saving lighting, all at the DeLand campus.
Improvements included a new coffeehouse.
In the past 3 years, over $17 million in new construction took place at the DeLand campus.
Sage Hall, home of the departments of natural sciences, received an $8.5 million renovation, while the Homer and Dolly Hand Art Center, the Rinker Environmental Learning Center, and Mary B. McMahan Hall &mdash; rehearsal space for the School of Music &mdash; were new constructions.
Along with student exhibitions, the university's extensive collection of paintings by American modernist <a>Oscar Bluemner</a> are housed in the Hand Art Center.
</p>
<p>The university also includes the <a>Stetson University College of Law</a>, the first law school in Florida.
It was relocated in 1954 from DeLand to <a>Gulfport, Florida</a>, a suburb of <a>St.
Petersburg</a>.
</p>
<p>There are also two satellite centers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Stetson University Center at <a>Celebration, Florida</a>, which opened in 2004.</li>
