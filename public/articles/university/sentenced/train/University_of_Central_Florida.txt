<p>   The <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>UCF</strong>, is a <a>metropolitan</a> <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Orlando</a>, <a>Florida</a>, <a>United States</a>.
UCF is a member institution of the <a>State University System of Florida</a>, and is currently the largest university in the <a>state</a>, and the <a>second-largest university</a> in the United States by enrollment.</p>
<p>The University of Central Florida was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University with the goal of providing highly-trained personnel to support the <a>Kennedy Space Center</a>, located only  to the east.
As the university's academic scope had expanded to encompass other disciplines, the school was renamed the University of Central Florida in 1978.
Although initial enrollment was only 1,948 students, as of 2010, enrollment consists of a 56,235 member student body representing over 140 countries, all 50 states and the <a>District of Columbia</a>.
The majority of the student population is located on the university's  main campus approximately  northeast of downtown Orlando and  southwest of <a>Daytona Beach</a>.
Since its founding, UCF has awarded more than 200,000 degrees, including 35,000 graduate and professional degrees, to nearly 170,000 alumni worldwide.
UCF's official colors are <a>black</a> and <a>gold</a> and the academic logo is a <a>Pegasus</a>.
The athletic teams, called the <a>'Knights'</a> and represented by the mascot <a>Knightro</a>, are members of <a>Conference USA</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>

The university was established on June 10, 1963 when the <a>Florida State Legislature</a> passed, and <a>Governor</a> <a>Farris Bryant</a> subsequently signed into law Bill No. 125.
<a>The Board of Regents</a> appointed <a>Charles Millican</a> the first president of the new university in 1965.
Millican, with the consultation of a citizen advisory group, would choose the name Florida Technological University as well as co-design the school's distinctive &quot;Pegasus&quot; seal.
Before the university was constructed, the land where it would be was desolate farm land.
In fact, the first time that Millican went to see the land where the new university would be, he could not find it and had to return weeks later with specific directions from the Chancellor of the Board of Regents.</p>
<p>In March 1967, Florida Governor <a>Claude Kirk</a> presided over the groundbreaking of the new Florida Technological University.
Eighteen months later on October 7, 1968, classes began with 1,948 students, 90 instructors and 150 staff members, in the schools first academic building, the library.
During the university's inaugural year, fifty-five degree programs were offered within its five colleges: Business Administration, Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Engineering and Technology.
The university's first mascot was the Citronaut, a mix between an orange and an astronaut.</p>
<p>UCF was founded as a non-segregated and <a>coeducation</a> university, with the founding goal being to educate current and future students for promising space-age careers in engineering, electronics and other technological professions, thus serving as a support system for the nearby <a>Kennedy Space Center</a>.
In addition, the <a>Central Florida Research Park</a>, located adjacent to the UCF campus, serves as a major focus of <a>simulation</a> for <a>space</a> and <a>defense</a>-related research.</p>
<h3>Expansion and growth</h3>
<p>The university's second <a>president</a>, Dr. Trevor Colbourn, recognized the diversification and growth of UCF's academic programs away from its strictly technological and scientific beginnings.
From its establishment the university was known as <strong>Florida Technological University</strong>, nicknamed <em>Florida Tech</em>, until December 1978 when Governor Reuben Askew signed legislation changing the school's name to the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>During its brief history, UCF has hosted numerous notable speakers.
Among these include <a>Presidents</a> <a>Richard Nixon</a> and <a>Bill Clinton</a>, then <a>Senator</a> and current <a>Vice President</a> <a>Joe Biden</a>, Senators <a>Bill Nelson</a>, <a>Mel Martinez</a>, <a>John Edwards</a>, and Florida Governors <a>Jeb Bush</a>, <a>Charlie Crist</a> and <a>Bob Graham</a> to name just a few.</p>
<p>The past decade has seen enrollment increase by over forty percent at UCF, the acceptance rate for first time in college students falling from over 60% to near 40% in 2008, and the doubling of expected annual expenses.
Hitt's efforts have resulted in not only an increase in the university's academic profile, but also an <a>on-campus football stadium</a>, <a>new arena</a>, more on-campus housing, and the development of the <a>UCF College of Medicine</a> at Lake Nona.</p>
<p>UCF is currently the largest university in the nation by terms of <a>undergraduate enrollment</a>, the largest university in Florida, and in 2003 held the distinction of being the fastest-growing university in the <a>United States</a>.
During its Spring 2010 <a>graduation</a> ceremonies, the University of Central Florida awarded its 200,000th degree, less than five years after awarding its 150,000th diploma.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|The UCF Reflection Pond and walkway in front of Millican Hall at night</a>The University of Central Florida has a unique campus layout that has become a model for other universities, reminiscent of the plans by <a>Walt Disney</a> for his <a>Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT)</a>.
The campus was designed to be a pedestrian oriented campus, with a series of concentric circles.
The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus.
Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle.
Pegasus Circle contains the student union, which is the center of the campus, with the library located directly to the south of it.
All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college.
As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night.
The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the <a>University of California, Irvine</a>.</p>
<p>Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus.
Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections.
The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities, the north side contains <a>Knights Plaza</a>, an uptown style athletic village, the east side contains the <a>Arboretum of the University of Central Florida</a>, and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities.</p>
<p>Located directly south of the main campus is <a>Central Florida Research Park</a>, which is the seventh largest research park in the nation and the largest in Florida, housing over 116 corporations.
The park provides more than 10,000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni.</p>
<h3>Regional campuses</h3>
<p>In addition to the main campus in Orlando, the University of Central Florida has several other campuses to service the central Florida region.
In Orlando, there are three other campuses, located in Downtown, Valencia West, and South Orlando, as well as partnerships with the local community colleges of <a>Brevard Community College</a>, <a>Lake-Sumter Community College</a>, <a>Seminole State College of Florida</a> and <a>Valencia Community College</a>.
Through this program all students and alumni of Brevard Community College, Lake-Sumter Community College, Seminole State College of Florida and Valencia Community College are assured admission to the university.
DirectConnect is considered to be the most productive community college-university partnership in America.</p>
<h3>Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona</h3>
<p>The 50 acre (0.20&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona will include the College of Medicine and the Burnett Biomedical Sciences building.
The <a>Burnham Institute for Medical Research</a>, a <a>Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a>, <a>Nemours Children&#x2019;s Hospital</a>, <a>Tavistock Group</a>, <a>M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute</a>, and a <a>University of Florida</a> research facility will also call Lake Nona home, turning the area into a medical city.
The campus will also serve as the future home of the UCF College of Nursing.
The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class in August 2009.</p>
<p>Upon completion of construction, the campus could accommodate as many as 5,000 upper division, professional, and graduate students and faculty members in the health-related programs, and include up to two million square feet of research and instruction space.</p>
<h3>Rosen College of Hospitality Management</h3>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>UCF has over 400 registered student organizations,</p>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p>  [[Image:UCF Tower.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tower
One at [[Knights Plaza]] as viewed from its promenade]] The university currently houses 6,000 beds on-campus in eight different housing communities.
<a>Residence hall</a> style <a>suites</a> are available in the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, and Nike communities.
All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms.
<a>Apartment</a> style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at <a>Knights Plaza</a>, and the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community.
UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the <a>Rosen College of Hospitality Management</a> campus.
The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students.
Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time.</p>
<p>Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well before the start of the Fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.
In order to provide additional student housing to meet the demand, UCF is constructing a new learning community known as NorthView directly north of the main campus.
When completed the project will house 600 students around a faith-based community center, which will include a <a>Hillel</a> Jewish Student Center, a Catholic Student Center, and a common space for other faith based organizations on campus to use.</p>
<p>In addition, upwards of 3,750 beds are available at the University-affiliated housing communities of Pegasus Landing and Pegasus Pointe, which are off-campus apartment communities owned by the University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc. and managed by <a>American Campus Communities</a>.
These communities contain many UCF services such as Resident Assistants, UCF Police service and offer shuttle service to and from campus on class days.
Pegasus Landing's community partnership agreement was suspended by the university in May 2010 due to health and safety issues.
UCF will no longer refer students to the complex and community services such as resident assistants and on-site advising will be discontinued, though UCF police patrols, on-site security and shuttles will continue.</p>
<p>Greek housing is also available on the main campus in the Greek Park community, which consists of close to 400 beds.
There are seven sororities and four fraternities housed on campus, with five fraternities offering housing off campus.
The <a>Order of Omega</a> has a chapter at the university.</p>
<p>The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 16 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 10 sororities.
In addition there are also many multicultural and honor Greek organizations.
The Diversified Greek Council consists of 9 cultural organizations, four fraternities and five sororities.
Approximately 11% of current undergraduates males and 9% of undergraduate females are members of either a sorority or fraternity.</p>
<p>The average GPA of Greek Life is higher than the overall university average.
UCF's Greek Life won the inaugural <a>Mid-American Conference</a> Grade Point Average Award, which is given to the university with the highest Greek GPA above their campus&#x2019; non-Greek GPA.
In 2003, Florida Leader Magazine named UCF the university with the best Greek academics program in the state.</p>
<h3>Student traditions</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Students in and around the Reflection Pond during Spirit Splash</a> Spirit Splash is a <a>homecoming</a> tradition at UCF, and is traditionally the only time during the year that students are allowed into the Reflection Pond.
Named one of the best homecoming traditions in the nation, the Friday before the Homecoming game is reserved for a pep rally at the Reflection Pond, where students descend into the pond to demonstrate their school spirit.</p>
<p>Spirit Splash has been named the best college or university tradition in Florida by Florida Leader magazine.
Along with the students, there are members of the community, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities.
Spirit Splash began in 1995 when the Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflection Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students at the pep rally followed suit.
<a>Knightro</a>, the <a>Marching Knights</a>, cheerleaders, <a>student athletes</a>, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert.
Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflection Pond in preparation for <a>President</a> <a>Richard Nixon's</a> visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement.
It was determined that the best way to protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that <a>Secret Service</a> agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.</p>
<p>One of the newest traditions on the UCF campus pertains to the Pegasus seal in the center of the main floor of the Student Union.
From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus.
As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal.
In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college <a>superstition</a> in Florida.</p>
<h3>Recreation</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|The UCF Recreation &amp; Wellness Center</a> Many different recreational organizations and facilities are available on the UCF campus.
Lake Claire is an on-campus lake with canoes, kayaks, and pedal boats available for rent (free to UCF students).
Students may also swim in the lake, which is the home to one shy,  gator, and the sunken wreck of a rowboat.
In addition, UCF's <a>Challenge Course</a> is one of only five in the country to contain a high elements course.</p>
<p>The UCF Recreation and Wellness Center, which opened in 2002, comprises five programs: Intramural Sports, Sport Clubs, Outdoor Adventure, Fitness, and Aquatics.
The Center is open to all students, and paid memberships are available for non-students.
The Wellness Center offers programs to boost students' understanding of their health, provides discounted blood and <a>STD</a> testing, staffs certified personal trainers, and teaches methods to maintain good health.
The recreation center includes a custom <a>climbing wall</a> with more than 20 different routes, as well as, tennis courts, sand volleyball courts, a disc golf course, numerous intramural sports fields, a leisure pool, and an outdoor lap pool.
In 2010, the Center underwent a $21 million,  expansion that created more room in the fitness center's free weight, cardiovascular and weight machine areas.
The Center now totals .</p>

<p>UCF joined Conference USA for all sports in 2005, and during their first year with the conference the Knights football team, under the leadership of second-year coach <a>George O'Leary</a>, concluded the fourth-best turnaround in NCAA history by winning the conference's eastern division and earning its first bowl berth in the <a>4th Annual Hawai'i Bowl</a>.
Celebrating their inaugural year in their new on-campus stadium, the <a>2007 UCF Football team</a> won the <a>Conference USA Championship</a> for the first time in the school's history, and the eastern division for the second time in three seasons, securing a berth to the school's second bowl game, the <a>49th Annual AutoZone Liberty Bowl</a>.

Following a 10&#x2013;0 start to the <a>2010&#x2013;11 season</a>, and being one of nine unbeaten teams, the Knights were nationally ranked for the first time in program history.
At the time, UCF was one of only four schools to be ranked in the BCS standings and the AP men's basketball poll.</p>
