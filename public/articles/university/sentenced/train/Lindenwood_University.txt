<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Tree-lined entrance in the historic part of the Lindenwood University campus.</a></p>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>Lindenwood University was founded in 1827 by George Champlin Sibley and <a>Mary Easton Sibley</a> as The Linden Wood School for Girls.
It is the second-oldest higher-education institution west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>The story began in 1812 at <a>Fort Sibley</a>, now known as the town of <a>Arrow Rock, Missouri</a>.
The US Army established the fort to protect settlers from <a>Native Americans</a>.
In 1826, Major <a>George Champlin Sibley</a> co-signed a $20,000 note, but his partner bailed out of the deal and left.
Sibley, now left with next to nothing, took possession of his former partner's assets, little more than  of land in <a>St.
Charles, Missouri</a>.
It was known as the &quot;Linden Wood&quot; because of its numerous linden trees.
In 1827, the Sibleys started the Linden Wood School for Girls, as Mary Sibley already had been running a school in St. Charles.
Later the girls' school was expanded into a full four-year college and eventually became a co-educational institution in 1969.</p>
<h3>Recent History and Expansion</h3>
<p>By 1989, Lindenwood College was in trouble.
Enrollment was around 800 students and the school was nearly broke.
<a>Dennis Spellmann</a> took over and immediately began to implement changes.
He eliminated co-ed dorms and put an emphasis on a &quot;values centered&quot; approach in the classroom.
Some of his changes caused controversy for the school.</p>
<p>Such was the &quot;Pork for Tuition&quot; program started in 2002.
The program was designed to help rural families pay for tuition by the university's accepting livestock in return for discounts.
The animals were processed and used for dishes with pork sausage, sausage, and hamburger in the school cafeteria.
The program became featured as a topic on <a>NBC</a>'s <em><a>Today Show</a></em>, in which host <a>Matt Lauer</a> called the school &quot;Pork Chop U&quot;.
<a>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> later staged a small protest in <a>Saint Charles</a>.</p>
<p>Lindenwood was briefly in the news in February 2005 when Spellmann refused a <a>National Park Service</a> grant for $200,000 to repair a historic building (the <a>Daniel Boone Home</a>) owned by the university.
Spellmann reportedly said that the bureaucracy involved in a federal grant was too great to be worthwhile.
He asked the Park Service to apply the money to paying down the federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>In 2006, Dennis Spellmann died.
By that time, the university had built its endowment to more than $50 million.
On February 9, 2007, Dr. James Evans, acting president since Spellmann's death, was chosen as Lindenwood's twenty-first president.</p>
<p>The university began an extensive expansion of academic, residence life, and athletic facilities in the mid-1990s.
That includes eight new residence halls, Ayres Hall and Harmon Hall expansions, the Spellmann Campus Center, <a>Lou Brock Sports Complex</a>, and <a>Harlen C. Hunter Stadium</a>.</p>
