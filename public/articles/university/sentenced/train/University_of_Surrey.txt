<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Surrey</strong> is a <a>university</a> located within the county town of <a>Guildford</a>, <a>Surrey</a> in the <a>South East</a> of England.
It received its <a>charter</a> on 9 September 1966, and was previously situated near <a>Battersea Park</a> in south-west <a>London</a>.
The institution was known as <strong>Battersea College of Technology</strong> before gaining university status.
Its roots however go back to the <strong>Battersea Polytechnic Institute</strong>, founded in 1891 to provide further and higher education for London's poorer inhabitants.</p>
<p>The university is a member of the <a>1994 Group</a>.
The university conducts extensive research on small <a>satellites</a> and has a high number of staff who are members of <a>learned societies</a>.
The <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> 2001 awarded nine departments at the university 5 or 5* ratings.
The university has recently expanded into China by launching the Surrey International Institute with <a>Dongbei University of Finance and Economics</a>.</p>
<p>The university's main campus is located on Stag Hill close to the centre of <a>Guildford</a> and adjacent to <a>Guildford Cathedral</a>.
A second campus, at Manor Park, is located a short distance away and has been developed to expand upon existing accommodation, academic buildings and sporting facilities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:UniSSoM.jpg|thumb|right|The
School of Management Building, with the statue of [[Alan Turing]] in the middle distance]] <a>thumb|right|Part of the new development of student accommodation at Manor Park</a> The University of Surrey was preceded by the Battersea Polytechnic Institute which was founded in 1891 and admitted its first students in 1894.
Its aims were to provide greater access to further and <a>higher education</a> for some of the &quot;poorer inhabitants&quot; of <a>London</a>.
The Institute focused on <a>science</a> and <a>technology</a> subjects, and from about 1920 taught some classes for <a>University of London</a> students.</p>
<p>In 1956 the Institute was among the first to receive the designation &quot;College of Advanced Technology&quot; and was renamed Battersea College of Technology.
By the beginning of the <a>sixties</a> the College had virtually outgrown its building in Battersea and had decided to move to Guildford.
In addition to this, the <a>Robbins Report</a> of 1963 proposed that the Colleges of Advanced Technology, including Battersea, should expand and become degree-awarding Universities.</p>
<p>In 1982 the university became the trustee of the building of the Guildford Institute and uses parts of the building for its adult education programme which ensures a university presence in the heart of Guildford.
The <a>Assessment and Qualifications Alliance</a> (formerly Associated Examining Board) moved from <a>Aldershot</a> to its own headquarters building on the Stag Hill campus in 1985.</p>
<p>The university marked its <a>Silver Jubilee</a> in 1991, an event celebrated by  the publishing of <em>Surrey - The Rise of a Modern University</em> by Roy Douglas  This was followed by a further increase in applications of 12% in 2008.</p>
<p>In June 2008, <a>Led Zeppelin</a> guitarist <a>Jimmy Page</a> was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university for services to the music industry.</p>
<p>In October 2008, the university lost out to <a>Royal Holloway</a> in a bid to merge with London medical institute <a>St George's, University of London</a>.</p>
<p>From September 2009, the <a>Guildford School of Acting</a> became a subsidiary of the university and relocated from Guildford town centre to the university campus.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|The area around the lake on the main Stag Hill Campus</a> The university moved in 1968 to a new  site on Stag Hill in <a>Guildford</a>, <a>Surrey</a>, adjacent to <a>Guildford Cathedral</a> (see picture, below).
A further  allocated to the university remained undeveloped until 2005.
The new Manor Park campus, designed as a car-free village, is  from the Stag Hill campus and on the other side of the <a>A3 trunk road</a>.
It combines residences for students and staff, buildings for research and teaching, and sporting facilities.</p>
<p>The BBC's local radio station for Surrey and North-East Hampshire, <a>BBC Surrey</a>, has its studios on the campus.
In addition the university has a student-run medium wave radio station, <em><a>GU2 Radio</a></em> (GU2 is the local postcode prefix).</p>
<p>In November 2007, the university was given planning permission to build the Surrey Multifaith Centre at the University of Surrey.
This will be the first building in Britain to have a Synagogue, Muslim Prayer Hall, Gurdwara and Chapel built separately under one roof.</p>
<p>In April 2010, a &#x00a3;35 million new <a>sports centre</a> named the <a>Surrey Sports Park</a> opened.</p>
<p>On 8 July 2009, a temporary Amigo convenience store opened in the BB Building on the campus, replacing the previous <a>One Stop</a> store which was situated near the library.
The new store is operated by the <a>Compass Group</a>, and will see the University enjoy 'guaranteed rental income and share of turnover'.
The project is part of wider work which will see a new building, housing a larger shop and library extension, opening on the One Stop site in April 2011.</p>
<p>In September 2009, the <a>Guildford School of Acting</a> moved into a new purpose built facility on the main Stag Hill campus as part of a stretegic merger between the two organisations.
After the opening of the news <a>Surrey Sports Park</a> in April 2010, the old Sports Centre is being converted into further studios and performance space for GSA.</p>
