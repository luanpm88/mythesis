<p><strong>Golden Gate University</strong> (informally referred to as <strong>GGU</strong>, or simply as <strong>Golden Gate</strong>) is a <a>private</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, coeducational university formed in 1901 and located in the <a>South of Market</a> district, immediately south of the <a>Financial District</a> of downtown <a>San Francisco</a>, California.
Golden Gate University is primarily a post-graduate institution focused on professional training in law and business, with its smaller undergraduate programs linked to its larger graduate and professional schools which include a law school (<a>Golden Gate University School of Law</a>), a business school (Ageno School of Business) and separate schools for the study of taxation and accounting.
It has no residential students, being entirely a &quot;commuter school&quot; located in the heart of the business district of San Francisco with a major student demographic being returning students and working professionals.
Golden Gate University is a public-benefit, not-for-profit institution.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|GGU Campus</a> The university evolved out of the literary reading groups of the <em>San Francisco Central <a>YMCA</a></em> at a time when, according to one contemporary estimate only one of every two thousand men had a college education.
The YMCA Evening College was formally established in 1896 and became a full-fledged operation in 1901 with the creation of the parallel YMCA Evening Law College.
It was housed in the YMCA building at Mason and Ellis Streets in the <a>Tenderloin</a>, which was destroyed in the <a>1906 Earthquake</a>.
Following the earthquake, the school was conducted out of tents, and later leased space at 1220 Geary St. (now <a>Geary Boulevard</a> near Franklin Street in the <a>Western Addition</a>.
In November 1910 the school moved into the YMCA's new building (closed in 2009) at 220 Golden Gate Avenue at Leavenworth Street, also in the <a>Tenderloin</a>.
A contest in 1910 resulted in the adoption of the new name <em>Golden Gate.</em> (in reference to the street the school was then located on, and indirectly to the geographic feature.)
The institution was separately incorporated from the Central YMCA in April 1923 as <em>Golden Gate College</em> with the power to confer degrees as California law then provided.
The college continued to share the &quot;Y&quot;'s building until 1968, when it moved into the Allyne Building, a former warehouse in the <a>South of Market</a> at 532&#x2013;536 <a>Mission Street</a> the College had purchased in May 1964; (the law school had moved there in December 1964.)
However, the YMCA contributed members to the school's Board of Trustees for over two decades thereafter.
In 1972, the College expanded and elevated itself to university status.
In 1979, a new &quot;west wing&quot; of the university was completed, where most of the classroom space is located today.</p>
