&lt;!--Paragraph 1/4: Introduction and history:--&gt; The <strong>London School of Economics and Political Science</strong> (informally the <strong>London School of Economics</strong> or the <strong>LSE</strong>) is a public research university specialised in the <a>social sciences</a> located in <a>London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a> and a <a>constituent college</a> of the federal <a>University of London</a>.
Founded in 1895 by <a>Fabian Society</a> members <a>Sidney Webb</a>, <a>Beatrice Webb</a> and <a>George Bernard Shaw</a>, the LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and degrees were issued to its students from 1902 onwards.
Despite its name the LSE conducts teaching and research across the entire range of the social sciences, including accounting and finance, anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, law, philosophy, politics, psychology, social policy and sociology.</p>
<p>&lt;!--Paragraph 2/4: Core profile:--&gt; The LSE is based in the <a>Westminster</a> area of <a>Central London</a> on the boundary between <a>Covent Garden</a> and <a>Holborn</a>.
It has around 8,700 full-time students and 1,300 academic staff and had a total income of &#x00a3;203 million in 2008/09, of which &#x00a3;20.3 million was from research grants and contracts.
The LSE's library, the <a>British Library of Political and Economic Science</a>, contains over 4.7 million volumes and is the world's largest social and political sciences library.
The LSE was found to have the highest percentage of world-leading research of any British university in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise.</p>
<p>&lt;!--Paragraph 3/4: People:--&gt; The LSE is among the world's most selective universities and has the lowest undergraduate admissions rate of any university in Britain.
It has the most international student body in the world, and at one time had more countries represented by students than the <a>United Nations</a> has members.
The LSE has produced many <a>notable alumni</a> in the fields of law, economics, business, literature and politics.
There are currently 16 <a>Nobel Prize winners</a> amongst the LSE's alumni and current and former staff, as well as 34 world leaders and numerous <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners and fellows of the <a>British Academy</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;!--Paragraph 4/4: Memberships and affiliations:--&gt; The LSE is a member of the <a>Association of Commonwealth Universities</a>, the <a>Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs</a>, the <a>European University Association</a>, the <a>Global Alliance in Management Education</a>, the <a>Russell Group</a> and <a>Universities UK</a>.
It forms part of the <a>'Golden Triangle'</a> of British universities and is a constituent of the <a>'G5'</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The London School of Economics was founded in 1895 by <a>Beatrice</a> and <a>Sidney Webb</a>, initially funded by a bequest of &#x00a3;20,000 from the <a>estate</a> of Henry Hunt Hutchinson.
Hutchinson, a lawyer left the money in trust, to be put &quot;towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the <a>trustee</a>s] deem advisable&quot;. in the <a>City of Westminster</a>.</p>
<p>The school joined the federal <a>University of London</a> in 1900, becoming the university's Faculty of Economics and awarding degrees of the University from 1902.</p>
<p>The school's arms, including its motto and <a>beaver</a> mascot, were adopted in February 1922, on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.
The <a>latin</a> motto, <em>&quot;Rerum cognoscere causas&quot;</em>, is taken from <a>Virgil</a>'s <a>Georgics</a>.
Its English translation is &quot;to Know the Causes of Things&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, the School has been active in British government proposals to introduce compulsory ID cards, researching into the associated costs of the scheme, and shifting public and government opinion on the issue.
The institution is also popular with politicians and <a>MPs</a> to launch new policy, legislation and manifesto pledges, prominently with the launch of the <a>Liberal Democrats</a> Manifesto Conference under <a>Nick Clegg</a> on 12 January 2008.</p>
<p><em><a>The Sunday Times</a><strong> recent profile of LSE for the </strong></em>2008 Sunday Times University Guide<em>, commented:</em> ::</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;<em>There are many who have achieved in the world of politics, business or academia who can trace their success to the years they spent at the LSE.
Inspired by tuition from academics who are often familiar faces, if not household names, LSE students take their first steps to greatness in the debating chambers, cafes, bars &#x2013; and even occasionally in their seminar groups &#x2013; during three or four years of studying'.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the top 10 employers of LSE graduates are principally accounting, investment banking, consultancy and law firms.
Indeed, LSE is often known as the 'investment bank nursery' due to around 30% of graduates going into &quot;banking, financial services and accountancy&quot;, according to LSE Careers Service official figures.
LSE is often the most preferred university for employers in the private sector, financial services abroad and the <a>City of London</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The New Academic Building at the LSE</a> [[File:HM Land Registry entrance.jpg|thumb|right|The
Former HM Land Registry Head Office, 32 [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], now owned by LSE]]</p>
<p>Over the years the School has continued to expand around Houghton Street.
A recent fund-raising scheme, called the &quot;Campaign for the LSE&quot; raised over &#x00a3;100 million in one of the largest university fund-raising exercises ever seen in Britain.
In 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 <a>Kingsway</a>.
This has been redeveloped by <a>Sir Nicholas Grimshaw</a> into an ultra-modern educational building, to be known as the &quot;New Academic Building&quot; at a total cost of over &#x00a3;45 million, and has increased the campus space by .
The building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by <a>Her Majesty the Queen</a> and the <a>Duke of Edinburgh</a> on 5 November 2008.</p>
<p>The School has an ongoing capital investment project and has recently purchased a number of sites to add to its portfolio.
In November 2009, LSE purchased the freehold of both Sardinia House, overlooking Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the Ye Old White Horse public house.
More recently, in October 2010, it was announced the university had been successful in acquiring the freehold of the grade-II listed gothic <a>Land Registry Building</a> adjacent to <a>Lincoln's Inn</a>.
It is currently also embarking on a &#x00a3;30 million project to build a new student centre, housing the students' union, careers service, accommodation office, events spaces, cafes, bars and a club.
The building will be located on the current St Phillips site, to be demolished in Summer 2010.
A new &#x00a3;25 million student residence is also expected to be built in Southwark by 2012.</p>
<p>Its current Director is <a>Sir Howard Davies</a>, who previously served as Chairman of the <a>Financial Services Authority</a>, Controller of the Audit Commission, Director General of the <a>Confederation of British Industry</a> and Deputy Governor of the <a>Bank of England</a>.
Following his first term in office, he has been reappointed as of June 2007, and will serve until 2013.</p>
<h2>Programmes and admission</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The main entrance in the early 1990s</a> LSE is dedicated solely to the study and research of social sciences, and is the only university in the United Kingdom to be so.
The School offers over 140 <a>MSc</a> programmes, 4 <a>MPA</a> programmes, an <a>LLM</a>, 30 <a>BSc</a> programmes, an <a>LLB</a> and 4 <a>BA</a> programmes (including International History and Geography).
LSE is only one of two British universities to teach a BSc in <a>Economic History</a>, the other being the <a>University of Cambridge</a>.
Other subjects pioneered by LSE include anthropology, criminology, international relations, social psychology, sociology and social policy.
Courses are split across more than thirty research centres and nineteen departments, plus a Language Centre.
Since programmes are all within the social sciences, they closely resemble each other, and undergraduate students usually take at least one course module in a subject outside of their degree for their first and second years of study, promoting a broader education in the social sciences.
At undergraduate level, certain departments are very small (90 students across three years of study), ensuring small lecture sizes and a more hands-on approach than other institutions.</p>
<p>Admission to LSE is extremely competitive.
According to 2008 UCAS figures, the school received 19,039 applications for 1,299 places.
This means that 15 applicants fought for each place, which is the highest ratio of any university in Britain.
Some courses, including Government, Economics and International Relations have more than 20 applicants per place and thus an admissions rate of around 5%.
Consequently, LSE is one of the world's most selective universities at the undergraduate level, with many courses surpassing the 7&#x2013;9 percent admissions yield of <a>Ivy League</a> universities <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Princeton</a> and <a>Columbia</a>.
Most programmes give out typical offers of A*AA-AAB at A-Level.</p>
<p>Entrance standards are also high for postgraduate students, who are required to have (for taught Master's courses) a First Class or good Upper Second Class UK <a>honours degree</a>, or its foreign equivalent.
The applications success rate for postgraduate programmes varies, although most of the major courses, including Economics and International Relations, consistently have an acceptance rate below 10%.
Some of the very top premium programmes such as the MSc Finance and the MSc Financial Mathematics have admission rates below 3%.
However, the LSE plans to increase the number of graduate places offered, by expansion allowed by the purchase of additional faculty buildings.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Houghton Street, the center of the LSE campus</a></p>
<p>The LSE has a university wide partnership in teaching and research with <a>Columbia University</a> in New York, <a>Peking University</a> and <a>Sciences Po Paris</a>, with whom it offers various joint degrees.
For example, the highly rated International History department offers a joint MA in International and World History with <a>Columbia University</a> and an MSc in International Affairs with <a>Peking University</a>, with graduates earning degrees from both institutions.
LSE also offers various joint degrees with other universities.
It offers the TRIUM Global Executive MBA programme jointly with <a>Stern School of Business</a> of <a>New York University</a> and <a>HEC School of Management</a>, Paris.
It is divided into six modules held in five international business locations over a 16-month period.
LSE also offers a Dual <a>Master of Public Administration</a> (MPA) with Global Public Policy Network schools such as <a>Sciences Po Paris</a>, the <a>Hertie School of Governance</a> and <a>National University of Singapore</a>.
The school also runs exchange programmes with the <a>University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>, <a>Fuqua School of Business</a>, <a>Kellogg School of Management</a>, <a>Stern School of Business</a> and <a>Yale School of Management</a> as part of its MSc in International Management and an undergraduate student exchange programme with the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a> in Political Science.</p>
<p>The LSE Summer School was established in 1989 and has expanded extensively with more than 4,000 participants in 2010.
The Summer School offers over 50 subjects based on regular undergraduate courses, from the Accounting, Finance, Law, International Relations and Management departments, and takes place over two sessions of three weeks, in July and August each year.
LSE also offers the LSE-PKU Summer School in collaboration with <a>Peking University</a>.
Courses from both Summer Schools can be used as credit against other qualifications, and some courses can be taken as part of a conditional offer for LSE Masters programmes.
In 2007 the Summer School accepted students from over 100 countries, including from some of the top colleges and universities in the world, as well as professionals from several national banks and major financial institutions.
As well as the courses, accommodation in LSE halls of residence is available, and the Summer School provides a full social programme including guest lectures and receptions.</p>
<p>The School has formed formal academic agreements with five international universities - <a>Columbia University</a> (New York City), <a>Sciences Po</a> (Paris), the <a>University of Cape Town</a>, <a>Peking University</a> (Beijing) and the <a>National University of Singapore</a>, in addition to numerous research agreements with <a>Oxford</a>, <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Yale</a>, <a>Chicago</a>, <a>NYU</a>, <a>Imperial College</a> and <a>UC Berkeley</a>.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>There are nearly 7,800 full-time students and around 800 part-time students at the School.
Of these, approximately 65% come from outside the <a>United Kingdom</a>.
The LSE has the most international student body in the world, which made international headlines.</p>
<p>The Union is responsible for the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies, as well as student welfare and issues regarding accommodation and other matters.
As of 2010, there are over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group.</p>
<p>The Media Group is a collective of four distinct outlets, each with their own history and identity.
A weekly student newspaper <em><a>The Beaver</a></em>, is published each Tuesday during term time and is amongst the oldest student newspapers in the country.
The Union's radio station<em> <a>Pulse!</a></em> has existed since 1999, and the television station <em>LooSE Television</em> has existed since 2005.
The <em><a>Clare Market Review</a></em> one of Britain's oldest student publications was revived in 2008 and has gone on to win many national awards.
Students also get access to <em><a>London Student</a></em>, which is published by the University of London Union.</p>
<p>In various forms, RAG Week has been operating since 1980, when it was started by then Student Union Entertainments Officer and now New Zealand MP <a>Tim Barnett</a>.</p>
<p>Affiliated with the LSESU, the LSE Athletics Union is the body responsible for all sporting activity within the university.
It is a member of <a>British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport</a> (BUCS).
In distinction to the &quot;blues&quot; awarded for sporting excellence at Oxford and Cambridge, LSE's outstanding athletes are awarded &quot;purples&quot;.</p>
<h2>Location and campus life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|View of Houghton Street</a> <a>thumb|St Clement's Building</a> LSE moved to its present day central London campus at <a>Clare Market</a> and Houghton Street in <a>Westminster</a>, off the <a>Aldwych</a> and next to the <a>Royal Courts of Justice</a> and <a>Temple Bar</a> in 1902.
In 1920, King George V laid the foundation stone of the Old Building, the principal building of the LSE.
The School has gradually increased its ownership of adjacent buildings, creating an almost continuous campus between Kingsway and the Royal Courts of Justice.
Today, the campus consists of approximately thirty buildings, connections between which have been established on an ad-hoc basis, with often confusing results.
The floor levels of buildings do not always equate, leading to an individual being on a different &quot;floor&quot; after passing through a hallway.
The campus also has a series of extension bridges between buildings created high on the upper floors to connect several buildings.
The school is also noted by its numerous statues, either animals or surrealist, often donated by alumni.</p>
<p>LSE's campus went through a renewal under former Director <a>Anthony Giddens</a> (1996&#x2013;2003), with the redevelopment of Connaught and Clement Houses on the Aldwych, and the purchase of buildings including the George IV public house, which had been nestled amongst the campus for decades, but is now owned by the LSE.
Recent projects have included the &#x00a3;35 million renovation of the Lionel Robbins Building, which houses the British Library of Political and Economic Science, LSE's Library and a brand new Student Services Centre in the Old Building as well as the LSE Garrick on the junction of Houghton Street and Aldwych.
In 2009, the School purchased Sardinia House on Lincoln's Inn Fields and the <em>Ye Olde White Horse</em> public house, adjacent to Parish Hall, as new additions to the estate.
Since 2010, LSE has also leased premises behind the Library in New Court and will open a new medical centre on Lincoln's Inn Fields in Queen's House in September 2010.</p>
<p>The New Academic Building (the former Public Trust Building on Kingsway), is one of the most environmentally friendly university buildings in the UK.
With an entrance overlooking Lincoln's Fields, the new building has dramatically increased the size of the campus, incorporating four new lecture theatres, the Departments of Management and Law, computer and study facilities.</p>
<p>The <a>British Library of Political and Economic Science</a> (BLPES) is the current operating Library of the LSE.
It is the home of the world's largest social and political sciences Library, containing over 4.7 million volumes on its shelves.
This also makes it the second largest single entity library in Britain, after the British Library at King's Cross.
Other buildings of note include the <a>Peacock Theatre</a>, the School's main lecture theatre, seating 999 persons, which by night serves as the West End base of <a>Sadler's Wells</a>.
The venue is a member of the Society of London Theatre, and has hosted many dance, musical and dramatic productions, as well as serving as the base for many of the LSE' public lectures and discussions.</p>
<p>LSE is famous for its public lectures programme, organised by the LSE Events office which is open to students, alumni and the general public.
These weekly lectures are regularly given by prominent national and international speakers including ambassadors, authors, CEOs, Members of Parliament, leading professors and heads of state.</p>
<p>Recent speakers have included <a>Gordon Brown</a>, <a>Dmitri Medvedev</a>, <a>Colonel Gadaffi</a>, <a>John Atta Mills</a>, <a>Alistair Darling</a>, <a>George Soros</a>, <a>David Cameron</a>, <a>Kevin Rudd</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, <a>George Osborne</a>, <a>Lord Stern</a>, <a>Cherie Booth</a>, <a>Ben Bernanke</a>, <a>John Major</a>, <a>Mary McAleese</a>, <a>Rowan Williams</a>, <a>Alan Greenspan</a>, <a>Robert Peston</a>, <a>Will Hutton</a>, <a>Hilary Benn</a>, <a>Hazel Blears</a>, <a>Richard Lambert</a>, <a>Joschka Fischer</a>.
<a>Jack Straw</a>, <a>Baroness Thatcher</a>, <a>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a>, <a>Jens Lehmann</a>, <a>Kofi Annan</a>, <a>Tony Blair</a>, <a>Gerhard Schroeder</a>, <a>John Lewis Gaddis</a>, <a>Joseph Meegan</a>, <a>Costas Simitis</a>, <a>Luiz In&#x00e1;cio Lula da Silva</a>, <a>Lee Hsien Loong</a>, <a>Milton Friedman</a>, <a>Jeffrey Sachs</a>, <a>Vicente Fox</a>, <a>Noam Chomsky</a> and <a>Nelson Mandela</a>.</p>
<p>LSE has also introduced LSE Live, which is a series of public lectures that are broadcast live over the internet, as well as being open to the LSE community, and occasionally to the general public.
Introduced in 2008, the series has seen many prominent speakers such as <a>George Soros</a>, <a>Thomas L. Friedman</a>, <a>Fareed Zakaria</a> and <a>Ben Bernanke</a>, chairman of the Federal Reserve System of the United States.</p>
<p>The LSE also hosts many concerts and plays, with <a>We Are Scientists</a>, <a>Wiley</a>, <a>Robin Williams</a>, <a>Alan Fletcher</a> (better known as <a>Neighbours'</a> <a>Dr.
Karl Kennedy</a>) and <a>Tim Westwood</a> performing along with numerous lunchtime classical music recitals.</p>
<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Northumberland House</a> LSE operates eleven halls of residence centred in and around central London, consisting ten residential facilities owned and operated by LSE and a further residence operated by Shaftesbury Student Housing.
Together, these residences accommodate over 3,500 students.
In addition, there are also eight intercollegiate halls shared with other constituent colleges of the <a>University of London</a>, accommodating approximately 25% of the School's first year intake.</p>
<p>The School guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students, regardless of their present address.
Many of the School's larger postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living.
Whilst none of the residences are located at the Houghton Street campus, the closest, Grosvenor House is within a five-minute walk from the School in <a>Covent Garden</a>, whilst the farthest residences (Nutford and <a>Butler's Wharf</a> are approximately forty-five minutes by <a>Tube</a> or <a>Bus</a>).</p>
<p>Each residence accommodates a mixture of students both domestic and foreign, male and female, and, usually, undergraduate and postgraduate.
New undergraduate students (including <a>General Course</a> students) occupy approximately 36% of all spaces, with postgraduates taking approximately 56% and continuing students about 8% of places.</p>
<p>The largest residence, Bankside, opened in 1996 and accommodates 617 students across eight floors overlooking the River Thames and located behind the popular <a>Tate Modern</a> art gallery on the south bank of the River.
<a>High Holborn</a>, approximately 10&nbsp;minutes from campus was opened in 1995 and remains the second largest residence.
Other accommodation is located well for London's attractions and facilities - Butler's Wharf is situated next to <a>Tower Bridge</a>, Rosebery in the <a>London Borough of Islington</a> and near <a>Sadler's Wells</a> and Carr-Saunders Hall, named after the LSE professor is approximately 5&nbsp;minutes from <a>Telecom Tower</a> in the heart of <a>Fitzrovia</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Grosvenor House Studios</a> Since 2005, the School has opened three new residences to provide accommodation for all first year students.
Lilian Knowles, independently operated, is home for approximately 360 students and opened in 2006.
Planning permission was sought to convert Northumberland House, on <a>Northumberland Avenue</a> into a new residence on 2 June 2005, and the accommodation opened to students in October 2006.</p>
<p>The newest accommodation development is Northumberland House, a Grade II listed building, located between the Strand and Thames Embankment.
It was formerly a <a>Victorian</a> grand hotel and lately government offices.</p>
<p>The closest residence to the Houghton Street campus is reserved for postgraduate students and is located on the eastern side of <a>Drury Lane</a> at the crossroads of <a>Great Queen Street</a> and <a>Long Acre</a>.
Grosvenor House, converted from a Victorian office building, opened in September 2005.
The residence is unique in that all of its 169 rooms are small, self-contained studios, with private toilet and shower facilities and a mini-kitchen.</p>
<p>There are also eight <a>intercollegiate halls</a>.</p>
<p>Some students are also selected to live in <a>International Students House, London</a>.</p>
<h2>Libraries and archives</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|Library roof</a> The main library of the LSE is the <a>British Library of Political and Economic Science</a> (BLPES).
It is the home of the world's largest social and political sciences Library.
Founded in 1896, it has been the national social science library of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth and all its collections have been recognised for their outstanding national and international importance and awarded 'Designation' status by the Museums Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).</p>
<p>BLPES responds to around 6,500 visits from students and staff each day.
In addition, it provides a specialist international research collection, serving over 12,000 registered external users each year.</p>
<p>The Shaw Library, housed in an impressive room in the Old Building contains the university's collection of fiction and general readings for leisure and entertainment.
The <a>Fabian Window</a> is also located within the library, having been unveiled by <a>Tony Blair</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>Additionally, students are permitted to use the libraries of any other University of London college, and the extensive facilities at <a>Senate House</a> Library, situated in <a>Russell Square</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The <a>Fulbright Commission</a> states that &quot;The London School of Economics and Political Science is the leading social science institution in the world&quot;.</p>
<p>[[File:Lse library interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] designed library at LSE]] In the <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (from 2010 two separate rankings will be produced by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and the <a>QS World University Rankings</a>), the school was ranked 11th in the world in 2004 and 2005, but controversially dropped to 66th and 67th in the 2008 and 2009 edition.
The school administration asserts that the fall was due to a controversial change in methodology which hindered social science institutions.
In January 2010, THE concluded that their existing methodology system with <a>Quacquarelli Symonds</a> was flawed in such a way that it was unfairly biased against certain schools, including the LSE.
A representative of <a>Thomson Reuters</a>, THE's new partner, even stated: &quot;The LSE stood at only 67th in the last Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings - some mistake surely?
Yes, and quite a big one.&quot;
LSE also appears high up in the employer review surveys and since the rankings inception, has never finished outside of the world's top 5 universities in the eyes of employers.
In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, the LSE had the highest percentage of world-leading research of any British higher education institution.
The Independent Newspaper placed LSE first in the country for its research, on the basis that 35% of its faculty were judged to be doing world leading work, compared to 32% for both <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> respectively.
Furthermore, according to the Times Newspaper, the LSE ranks as joint-second (with Oxford) by grade point average across the fourteen units of assessment submitted, behind only Cambridge.
According to these RAE results, the LSE is the UK's top research university in Anthropology, Economics, Law, Social Policy and European Studies.

[[Richard Wilson (sculptor)|Richard Wilson]] sculpture on the facade of the LSE's New Academic Building]]</p>
<p>Various specific LSE departments also ranked highly.
In 2009, the MSc Management and Strategy programme was ranked 4th in the world by the <em>Financial Times' Masters in Management Ranking</em> (4th in 2008, 3rd in 2007, 8th in 2006, 4th in 2005) and the TRIUM Executive MBA was ranked 2nd in the world by the 2009 <em>Financial Times EMBA Ranking</em>.
The LSE also ranks highly in various world rankings of Economics and International Relations departments.
With regards to the latter, a February 2009 TRIP survey of 2,724 academics from International Relations faculty in 10 countries placed LSE's PhD program 6th in the world and its terminal masters programs (which include MSc's in International Relations, International Relations Theory, Theory and History of International Relations, History of International Relations, and International Political Economy) 7th in the world and 1st amongst British and African academics surveyed.
One of the flagship MSc degrees is the MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics, which has been named one of the most prestigious 5 degrees in the world, alongside Harvard's MBA.
The programme is considered the top feeder to top US PhD programmes, and is recognised as arguably the toughest MSc-level degree in the world.
Also highly esteemed, is the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method which was established in 1946 by <a>Karl Popper</a>.
Popper is widely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century and is noted for his influential theories regarding <a>falsification</a> and <a>open society</a>.
Both he and his successor <a>Imre Lakatos</a>, who joined the department in 1960, were instrumental in shaping 20th century philosophy of science and the social sciences.
The Philosophical Gourmet Report of 2009 ranks the department as 1st in the world for Philosophy of Social Science.</p>
<p>Domestically, LSE is one of only four British institutions to have never ranked outside the top 10 in any newspaper compiled league table.
The school, with Imperial College, has often dominated the position immediately after Oxbridge, but since 2009, has slipped due to the introduction of student satisfaction scores.
Indeed, the LSE ranked 3rd overall in the <em>Sunday Times University Guide<strong> cumulative ranking over a ten year period (1997&#x2013;2007), but dropped to 7th, in the 2009 Times Good University Guide.
LSE graduates often score highly in the 'employment prospects' section of guides, with students considered to have the best 'graduate prospects' of any British university in all 2009 rankings.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>Note: As stated above, LSE claim that the institutional rankings of the most recent THE/QS tables (2009-2007) do not fairly rank specialist institutions like the LSE.
In 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings.
LSE dropped further in both rankings, coming in at 80 in the QS rankings and 86 in the new THE rankings.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The LSE has a long list of notable alumni and staff, spanning the fields of scholarship covered by the school.
Among them are sixteen <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners <a>Mervyn King</a>, the current <a>Governor of the Bank of England</a>, is also a former professor of economics.</p>
<p>Many <a>alumni</a> of the school are notable figures, especially in the areas of politics, economics and finance.
