<h2>History</h2>

The architects were <a>John Carrere and Thomas Hastings</a>, working  for <a>Henry Morrison Flagler</a>, the industrialist, oil magnate and railroad pioneer.
It is now listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1968, the college has spent more than $43 million restoring the historic campus and adding new buildings.
The  newest buildings are the three-part former headquarters of the <a>Florida East Coast Railway</a> (FEC) buildings on Malaga St. which have been converted into one female and one male dorm building; Cedar Hall male dorm rooms on the corner of Cedar Street and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue; and the Ringhaver Student Center.
The campus is located in the heart of St. Augustine, just four miles (6&nbsp;km) from the Atlantic Ocean.
Flagler's  athletic field is two miles (3&nbsp;km) from campus.
While the college has recycled some historic buildings into new uses, it has also stirred up much controversy by seeking to demolish historic buildings surrounding the campus.</p>
<p>Henry Flagler's grandson, Lawrence Lewis, Jr., was the driving force behind the development of Flagler College.
It was his vision to create a small, private <a>liberal arts college</a> on the grounds of the old hotel.
Lewis served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Flagler College for more than 20 years, guiding the College through a re-organization in 1971.
He directed millions of dollars through foundations, family and personal funds into new construction, restoration projects, endowment and various other programs to  ensure the continued success of Flagler College.</p>

The male dormitories are located at Lewis House, which opened in 1987, and Cedar Hall, which was constructed in 2004.
Most classes are taught in Kenan Hall, which is adjacent to Ponce de Leon Hall.
Classes not taught here can be located in the Ringhaver Student Center, Proctor Library, the Communications Building at 31 Cordova Street, the Art Building directly behind Kenan Hall or the Flagler College Auditorium at 14 Granada Street.

<h2>Newspaper controversy</h2>
<p>Since September 2006, there have been several allegations of censorship or alteration of articles within the college newspaper, <em>The Gargoyle</em>, by the college administration.
In 2006, one issue of the newspaper was removed from circulation due to an alleged error in its headlines about rising tuition.
In April 2007, the college administration again exercised editorial control over the paper due to alleged fact errors.
Students rallied and organized a protest against any type of censorship of the newspaper, calling for a free and independent student press.
As of September 2007, working on The Gargoyle is no longer required of communication major and an advisory board and operating guidelines have been set up to handle any future situations which may arise, and also to help outline the function of The Gargoyle.</p>
