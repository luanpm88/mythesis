<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>College of the Holy Cross</strong> (or, <strong>Holy Cross</strong>) is an undergraduate <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Worcester, Massachusetts</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Founded in 1843, Holy Cross is the oldest <a>Roman Catholic</a> college in New England and one of the oldest in the United States.
</p>
<p>Opened as a school for boys under the auspices of the <a>Society of Jesus</a>, it was the first Jesuit college in <a>New England</a>.
Today, Holy Cross is one of 28 member institutions of the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a> (AJCU) and is part of the <a>Colleges of Worcester Consortium</a> (COWC).
Students are encouraged to become &quot;men and women for others&quot; and question, &quot;What is our special responsibility to the world's poor and powerless?&quot;
as noted in the College Mission Statement.
On July 1, 2000, Rev. Michael C. McFarland, S.J. became the current president of the college.
As of March 2010, the Holy Cross endowment was valued at $570 million.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Holy Cross was founded by Benedict Joseph Fenwick, SJ, second Bishop of <a>Boston</a>, after his efforts to found a Catholic college in <a>Boston</a> were thwarted by the city's <a>Protestant</a> civic leaders.
From the beginning of his tenure as the second Bishop of Boston, Benedict Joseph Fenwick of the Society of Jesus aimed to establish a Catholic College within the boundaries of his diocese.
[[Image:fenwick.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Benedict
Joseph Fenwick]], SJ, founder of Holy Cross]] Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the College of the Holy Cross  west of the city in central Massachusetts where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy.
The funds allowed Holy Cross to establish an additional 12 new faculty positions, along with more than 75 newly endowed scholarships for students.
The campaign provided support for the renovation of the Mary Chapel as well as construction of new facilities on campus, including Smith Hall, which houses the new Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture; a five-story apartment-style residence housing 244 seniors; and a new 1,350-seat soccer stadium.
During the history of the campaign, the College's endowment grew to more than $544 million.
As of 2010, Holy Cross is in the top 3% of four-year colleges in the number of students going on to earn doctorates in their fields.</p>
<p>The top five majors for the 2008-2009 school year were <a>Economics</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Political Science</a>, and <a>Sociology</a>.
Holy Cross also offers multidisciplinary concentrations, pre-professional programs, and the option to create a major or minor through the Center for Interdisciplinary and Special Studies.
Holy Cross students who apply to medical school have an 84% acceptance rate and for law school an 82% acceptance rate.
The College notes that the medical school acceptance rate is more than twice the national average.
D. Neel Smith, one of the department professors, is a primary collaborator on the <a>Perseus Project</a>, the multimedia database of Greek <a>antiquity</a> created by several college and universities.
During the 2006-07 academic year, Holy Cross will specifically be editing the Homer Multitext Project, a long-term analysis and electronic presentation of all the many variations of <a>Homer</a>&#x2019;s epic poetry.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p>Holy Cross has traditionally drawn many of its students from a pool of historical Catholic high schools and private <a>boarding schools</a>, though a slight majority of current undergraduates come from public schools.
Holy Cross received 6,700 applications for admission to the Class of 2010 &#x2014; a 41 percent increase from the previous year and a school record.
Holy Cross is also the only Catholic college among the top 50 liberal arts schools on the U.S. News list.
In 2010, Holy Cross had the highest four-year graduation rate in the country.
Additionally, the financial publication Kiplinger's ranked Holy Cross the 8th best value amongst private U.S. liberal arts colleges, behind only Bowdoin, Washington and Lee, Pomona, Wellesley, Amherst, Williams and Swarthmore.
Kiplinger's focuses on schools with &quot;...strong academics, generous financial-aid policies, and in some cases, a decent price to begin with.&quot;</p>
<p>In May 2005, Holy Cross announced that it would no longer make standardized test scores an admissions requirement, which college officials argued would lower the importance of the tests and place far greater weight on the academic experience of a candidate as demonstrated through the high school transcript and recommendations.
As of October 2006, there are over 730 four-year colleges and universities of varying rank which do not use the SAT I or ACT to admit bachelor degree applicants including Holy Cross.
Tuition for full-time students for the 2006-07 academic year is $32,820.
The Montserrat Program emphasizes discussion in a small, seminar format and promotes learning outside the classroom through a unique incorporation of residence hall life.</p>
<p>Students choose from seminars and are encouraged to choose out of interest, not due to major or common area requirement.
The seminar is a year-long course, although some professors team-teach a seminar and switch positions for the fall and spring semesters.
Each seminar is grouped into a residence cluster.
For example, a student could be in either the &quot;Industry and Empire&quot; or &quot;Islam and the West: Encounters&quot; seminar but belong to the &quot;Global Society&quot; cluster.</p>
<p>The Montserrat Program is an extension of the First Year Program, or FYP, created in 1992.
By tradition, the FYP seminars incorporated 19th-century Russian author <a>Leo Tolstoy</a>'s question: &quot;How, Then, Shall We Live?&quot;
The theme for the 2006 academic year was &quot;With so many claims of what's good and true, how then shall we live?
Even though each seminar covers different academic areas, all FYP students read six common readings.
All FYP members lived within the same residence hall, Hanselman Hall, which distinguishes it from other first-year efforts at colleges and universities nationwide minus a residential component.
In its analysis of FYP participants in relation to the first-year class as a whole, evaluations show that FYP students &quot;rated their residence more favorably than did other first-year students&quot;, &quot;perceived a greater sense of community and tolerance among their floormates&quot;, and &quot;behaved more responsibly than other first-year students as evidenced by fewer disciplinary cases and alcohol-related incidents&quot;.
In an effort to extend these favorable results, the College expanded FYP from the 150-student program to the Montserrat Program which includes all first-year Holy Cross students.Through Montserrat, the College hopes that &quot;Placing new students into high-level courses that grapple with big-picture ideas, the college hopes, will promote self-discovery and reflections about what makes a life well-lived.&quot;
An emphasis on independent research prepares students for their intensive thesis projects, the results of which are published within the College.
Honors students also publicly present their findings at the annual academic conference, a highlight of the academic year.</p>
<h2>Social justice and volunteerism</h2>
<p>As noted by the college mission statement, &quot;What is our special responsibility to the world's poor and powerless?&quot;, a key focus of Holy Cross, as an institution, is the Jesuit philosophy of <em>homines pro aliis</em>, &quot;men and women for others.&quot;
In 2010, Holy Cross obtained the highest rank of the 28 U.S. Jesuit colleges and universities in the percentage of its graduates who go on to serve in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.
Today, Holy Cross, similar to the religious order of the Jesuits as a whole, has been criticized by some parties for being overly liberal and deviating substantially from official Church teaching and papal directives, especially on such issues as abortion, homosexuality, liberation theology, and in its sponsorship of events such as the <a>Vagina Monologues</a>.
Since 2000, the College has hosted a conference allowing seminars from <a>Planned Parenthood</a> and <a>NARAL</a>.
In 2007, Bishop Robert McManus wrote the College asking Fr.
McFarland to cancel the event, and threatened to remove the Catholic status of the College if the conference was not cancelled.
As of 2010, Bishop McManus has not followed through on this threat.</p>
<p>In 2001, Holy Cross was one of 28 colleges and universities in the country to receive a grant from the <a>Lilly Endowment</a> in the amount of $2 million.
With the grant, the school launched a five-year program to &quot;make theological and spiritual resources available to students as they discern their life work, including consideration of vocations of ministerial service within religious denominations.&quot;
The grant has also been used to fund internships within the city of Worcester and <a>Worcester County</a> for students considering career opportunities in ministry, government, and social service agencies.
Holy Cross is marked by an irregular layout as its  campus is situated on the northern slope of a very steep hill named Mount Saint James which offers it a panoramic view of the city of Worcester.
The design and landscape is ingrained into many themes and nicknames for the school which is commonly known as <strong>The Hill</strong>.
</p>
<p>Today, some 37 college buildings are divided primarily with residential housing and academic buildings located in the middle sections of the campus, with athletic and practice facilities on the outskirts of the campus on its northern and southern ends.
Holy Cross also owns 6 non-campus properties.</p>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The college's flagship building, Fenwick Hall.</a></p>
<p>Anchoring the traditional campus gateway of Linden Lane are Stein and O&#x2019;Kane Halls, the latter of which is marked by a clock tower.
The oldest part of campus lies in this area, as O&#x2019;Kane is connected to Fenwick Hall, the first building which was designed in 1843; it also houses the admissions offices and the Brooks Concert Hall.
This area contains manicured trees and landscaped greens which include three nude bronze statues by Enzo Plazzotta, Georg Klobe, and Welrick on the hillside.
This is a popular spot for pranks as students take turns dressing up the statues.
Notable buildings north of this area are Dinand Library; Smith Hall, the Hogan Campus Center; the scientific complex housing O'Neil, Swords, and Haberlin Halls, and Beaven Hall, home to an assortment of academic departments.
Smith Hall, opened in 2001, was financed in large part by Holy Cross alumnus Park B. Smith, and is architecturally impressive as it is built into a hillside of the campus.
Smith Hall connects the lower campus, where much of the academic life occurs, and the upper campus, where much of the social and residential life takes place on campus due to its design which incorporates Fenwick Hall.
A plaza outside Smith Hall, named Memorial Plaza, commemorates seven Holy Cross alumni who perished in the <a>September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.</p>
<p>To the western end of campus lies Millard Art Center, St.
Joseph Memorial Chapel, the Chaplains' Office (Campion House), and Loyola Hall, which served as the Jesuit residence in the past, but has since been converted into another hall for student housing.
The Jesuit residence is now located in the Northeast corner of the campus, called Ciampi Hall.</p>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p>Holy Cross operates 10 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters.
More than 90 percent of students live on campus.
Dorm pride is highly prominent on campus; various dorms have created clubs or other forms of co-curricular programs.
For instance, Mulledy Hall, located near the peak of Campus, has spawned such groups as the infamous &quot;Mulledy Five-0&quot;.
Beginning in 2010, the Mulledy Five-0 has developed a loyal following, but is very exclusive with who it admits.
Even going so far as to create partial members, such as &quot;The Jackal.&quot;</p>
<p>The apartments in Williams Hall are the most sought after living arrangements on campus.
Completed in 2003, each apartment houses four students and comes equipped with a bathroom with separate shower, kitchen, living room, and two bedrooms.
Williams Hall was rededicated in honor of <a>Edward Bennett Williams</a> on April 26, 2008.</p>
<p>;Dinand Library The main library, Dinand Library, holds an estimated 601,930 books, serials, and periodicals.
Originally opened in 1927, the Dinand Library expanded in 1978 with two new wings dedicated to the memory of Joshua and Leah Hiatt and victims of the Nazi <a>Holocaust</a>.
The reading room of Dinand is also the scene of important College gatherings, including the Presidential Awards Ceremony, first-year orientation presentations, concerts, and other events.
<a>right|thumb|O'Kane Hall and clock tower, view from northern end of campus.</a>Dinand is considered by many students the most scholarly and inspiring building on campus.
Constructed in the 1920s, the room&#x2019;s ceiling is sectioned in a grid-like pattern and embellished with gold, painted trim and carvings along the top of the interior walls.
Large wooden candelabra are suspended from the ceiling, and Ionic columns&#x2014;echoing those on the Library&#x2019;s exterior&#x2014;anchor three sides of the room.
The main reference collection of dictionaries, encyclopedias, and bibliographies are found within Dinand, as well as the on-line catalog, and a staffed reference desk.</p>
<p>;College Archives Dinand Library also houses the College Archives which collects, preserves, and arranges records of permanent value from the college's foundation in 1843 to the present.
The Archives contain complete runs of all college publications including yearbooks, the college catalog, <em>The Crusader</em>, its predecessor <em>The Tomahawk</em>, the literary magazine <em>The Purple</em>, newsletters, pamphlets, and similar material.
An extensive photograph collection documents administrators, staff, faculty, students, alumni, athletic teams, student activities, the built environment and college life in general.
</p>
<p>There is also an extensive collection of audio visual material documenting theatrical plays, lectures, and sporting and other events.
The College Archives also hold a Special Collections section which consists of the College's Rare Book Collection, and the Jesuitana Collection (material by and about Jesuits).
Noted collections include: the papers of James Michael Curley, David I. Walsh, Louise Imogen Guiney, and Rev. Joseph J. Williams, S.J.
There are also collections of material by and about Jesuits, college alumni, and friends of the college.
It also holds research material about Catholic New England, the education of deaf Catholics, the Holocaust, as well as New England history.</p>
<p>The O'Callahan Science Library, named in honor of <a>Rev.
Joseph T. O'Callahan, S.J.</a>, houses over 95,000 volumes of works and periodicals serving the Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics Departments of the Holy Cross and the more neuroscientific side of Psychology.</p>
<p>The Rehm Library, dedicated in September 2001, is housed within Smith Hall.
The Rehm Library serves as the primary public space for the Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture and other departments with offices within Smith Hall.
Rehm Library provides space for hospitality, Center-sponsored lectures and events, quiet space for reading and reflection, and enhanced library resources on religion and spirituality.
While not a library in the traditional sense, the shelves of Rehm Library house primary texts of an array of religious traditions.
It was named in honor of alumnus Jack Rehm '54 and his family.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> Holy Cross sponsors 27 varsity sports; all but two of which compete at the NCAA Division I level (FCS for football),and NCAA Division I Hockey.
The Crusaders are members of the Patriot League, the Atlantic Hockey Association, the Division III Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference in women's hockey, and the Big South Conference in women's golf.
Of its 25 varsity teams, Holy Cross supports twelve men's and thirteen women's sports.[<a>http://goholycross.cstv.com/calendar/holy-schedule.html</a>]
The carrying of 23 Division I varsity programs gives Holy Cross the largest ratio of teams-per-enrollment in the country.</p>
<p>It is a founding member of the <a>Patriot League</a>, and boasts that one-quarter of its student body participates in its varsity athletic programs.</p>
<p>Principal athletic facilities include the <a>Fitton Field</a> football stadium (capacity 23,500), Hart Recreation Center's basketball court (3,600), the newly renovated Fitton Field baseball park, which also called Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field (3,000), Holy Cross Field House, Hart Ice Rink (1,600), <a>Linda Johnson Smith Stadium</a> (1,320) and Smith Wellness Center, located inside the Hart Center.
The Linda Johnson Smith Soccer Stadium opened in the fall of 2006.
Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field is also home to the <a>Worcester Tornadoes</a>, a <a>Can-Am</a> minor league baseball team.</p>
<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p>A large number of student organizations are associated with the university.
With its relative distance from a major city, and without a <a>Greek life</a> at Holy Cross, undergraduate social life revolves around a number of school-sponsored groups, events and off-campus houses on nearby city streets (notably Boyden, Cambridge, Caro, Chelsea, College and Southbridge streets), which are open to upperclassmen and serve a similar role to that which fraternities and sororities do at some other campuses.</p>
<p>Holy Cross has award-winning moot and <a>mock trial</a> teams.
The team has won and placed highly in various national tournaments, including top two finishes at the National Intercollegiate Mock Trial Tournament during two of the past four years.
Holy Cross also has a unique student-published law journal, <strong>The Holy Cross Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy</strong>, which is published annually by undergraduate students.
</p>
<p>The college also features a variety of student journals, media, and newspapers including <em>The Fenwick Review</em>, a journal of conservative thought; <em><a>The Advocate</a></em>, a journal based in liberal principles; and <em><a>The Crusader</a></em>, the weekly newspaper published by Holy Cross students for the college community.
Free copies of the 4,000-circulation paper are available online or at campus newsstands on 10 Friday mornings each semester.
Holy Cross also has a student-run radio station, <a>WCHC</a>-FM 88.1.
WCHC, thanks to its position as a non-profit radio station, broadcasts commercial free year round even though students are only allowed to DJ during the academic year.
Its sports department also carries live broadcasts of many of the school's football, basketball, and hockey games.
</p>
<p>The &quot;Campus Activities Board (CAB)&quot;, a student-run organization, runs several committees that oversee campus-wide activities and student services.
The <strong>Student Government Association (SGA)</strong> charters and provides most of the funding for these organizations, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.
SGA was developed under a model of shared governance with the Division of Student Affairs.
The SGA maintains that it represents students through college governance, offers student services, and launches new programs and initiatives.
This government consists of a dual executive of Co-Presidents along with an Executive Cabinet.
The legislature is bicameral and consists of the elected Senate and the larger General Assembly.</p>
<p>The largest student organization at Holy Cross, <strong>Student Programs for Urban Development (SPUD)</strong>, is a community service organization sponsored by the college Chaplains&#x2019; Office consisting of over 25 different outreach programs and over 350 active members.
Other volunteer and social justice programs offered by Holy Cross include Pax Christi, the Appalachia Service Project, Oxfam America (formerly Student Coalition on Hunger and Homelessness (SCOHAH)), and the Arrupe Immersion Program, named in honor of Fr. <a>Pedro Arrupe</a>, S.J., which Holy Cross describes as <em>a faith based program responding to the call to work for peace and justice in the world.</em></p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>Student life at the Holy Cross is marked by a number of unique traditions and celebrations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pub Night</strong>: On most Tuesdays during the school year, seniors, and various upperclassmen gather at the Pub located in the Hogan Campus Center.
The event coincides with the &quot;10 Spot&quot;, a weekly open mic night for Holy Cross bands, and occasionally outside performers, which occurs next to the Pub.</li>
  <li><strong>Stickball</strong>:Wheeler Hall is the most storied of the resident halls, known for its unique traditions.
It is also the site for a popular campus sport known as stickball, a long standing Holy Cross tradition usually played by Wheeler residents.
It has been roughly estimated that Holy Cross students began playing stickball at Wheeler Hall around 1940.
The Holy Cross version's origins are unknown.
The sport lends itself to neighborhood stickball, and is played with a tennis ball and broomstick, just like the popular city sport.
Wheeler Hall's five floors and symmetrical design makes it an ideal setting for the sport.
A hill behind home plate helps contribute to the playing area's natural amphitheater-like setting.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Weekend</strong>: The Spring Weekend, organized by the Campus Activities Board(CAB), is an annual event which marks the end of classes.
Always held the week before finals, events include the Spring Carnival, the <a>Battle of the Bands</a>, and a Spring Concert.
In the past, invited performers have included the <a>Pat McGee Band</a> (2001), <a>Wyclef Jean</a> (2002), <a>Third Eye Blind</a> (2003), <a>Howie Day</a> (2004), <a>The Roots</a> (2004), <a>Fabolous</a> and <a>The Starting Line</a>(2005), <a>Phantom Planet</a> (2006), <a>Guster</a> (2006), <a>O.A.R.</a> and <a>Stephen Kellogg</a> (2007), and <a>Jason Mraz</a> and <a>Everclear</a> (2008), Lupe Fiasco (2009), and <a>Drake</a> (2010).</li>
<li><strong> 100 Days Dance</strong>: Each spring, when 100 days are left at Holy Cross for the graduating Senior Class, the Purple Key Society (PKS), a service organization which fosters school spirit, loyalty and enthusiasm, sponsors an informal dinner and dance in their honor.
Tradition holds that attendees make list of fellow seniors they would like to kiss, and attempt to follow through before the night is over.</li>
<li><strong>Purple Pride Day</strong>: Each year, the Purple Key Society chooses a day to banner the campus the color purple, the official school color, to foster school spirit and pride.
This includes giving out purple balloons, purple t-shirts, purple cookies, purple stickers and various other items throughout the day.
Purple Pride Day usually coincides with a Holy Cross sporting event.</li>
<li><strong>Cape Week</strong>: Following the close of the Spring semester, many students spend a week of vacation on Cape Cod.
Students typically rent homes or stay in nearby hotels for a few days of parties and gatherings.
Typically, students spend the week in Hyannis or in neighboring towns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insignia and representations of Holy Cross</h2>
<p>;Color The school color is <a>purple</a>.
There are two theories of how Holy Cross chose purple as its official color.
One suggests it was derived from the royal purple used by King Constantine the Great (born about 275 A.D., died in 337 AD) as displayed on his labarum (military standard) and on those of later Christian emperors of Rome.</p>
<p>;Mascot Holy Cross's athletic teams for both men and women are known as the <a>Crusaders</a>.
It is reported that the name &quot;Crusader&quot; was first associated with Holy Cross in 1884 at an alumni banquet in Boston, where an engraved Crusader mounted on an armored horse appeared at the head of the menu.</p>
<p>;Motto The Latin motto <em>In Hoc Signo Vinces</em>, &quot;In This Sign You Shall Conquer&quot;, has been attributed to Emperor <a>Constantine</a> the Great, a Roman emperor noted for his tolerance of Christians.
According to some historians, Constantine had a dream or vision of a flaming cross in the sky with this inscription on the day preceding his decisive victory over Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge (October 28, 312).
This victory led to his capturing Rome and convinced him of the importance of Christianity.
The administration and the Student Government Association (SGA), have worked to improve this situation by directing various initiatives in recent years including the redevelopment of a nearby park, and its co-sponsorship, with the Society of Jesus of New England, to create the Nativity School of Worcester, an all-scholarship middle school serving boys from the city of Worcester.
Holy Cross also has created student liaison positions to attend Community meetings and engage residents and also created new on-campus housing to lessen the off-campus population.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Alumni</h2>
