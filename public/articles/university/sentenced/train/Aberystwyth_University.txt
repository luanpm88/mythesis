<p> <strong>Aberystwyth University</strong> (; sometimes shortened to &quot;Aber&quot;) is a university located in <a>Aberystwyth</a>, <a>Wales</a>.
Aberystwyth was a founding Member Institution of the former federal <a>University of Wales</a>.
As of late 2006, the University has over 12,000 students spread across seventeen academic departments.</p>
<p>The University was founded in 1872 as University College Wales.
In 1894, the University became a founder member of the University of Wales and changed its name to the University College of Wales Aberystwyth.
In the mid 1990s, the University again changed its name to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.
On 1 September 2007, the University of Wales ceased to be a federal university and Aberystwyth became an independent university in its own right once again.
However, students who now enroll with Aberystwyth from the academic year 2009/2010 onwards (or have studied their 1st year in the academic year 2008/2009) have the choice to receive a University of Wales degree or an Aberystwyth University degree.</p>
<p><a>The National Student Survey</a> named Aberystwyth fifth in the UK in 2006 and tenth in 2007, for overall student satisfaction.
<em><a>The Times</a></em> Good University Guide 2008 ranked Aberystwyth joint first in the UK for student satisfaction.
In the League table Aberystwyth is ranked 2nd in <a>Wales</a> after Cardiff University and 39th out of 113 institutions in the <a>United Kingdom</a> overall.
Aberystwyth was also short-listed for a best student experience award by the Times in 2007.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|The main Entrance to Old College at Aberystwyth University.</a>
The University was founded in 1872 as <em>University College Wales</em>.
The first Principal was <a>Thomas Charles Edwards</a> and initially there were just 26 students.
In 1894, the college joined the University of Wales as a founder member (prior to this students had been submitted for examinations to the <a>University of London</a>).
One of the newest departments in the University is the Department of Sports and Exercise Science, which was established in 2000.
Joint honours Psychology degrees were launched in September 2007.</p>
<p>The University's coat of arms was awarded in the 1880s.
The shield features two red dragons, the <a>red dragon</a> being a common symbol of Wales, and an open book, symbolising learning.
The crest is an eagle or phoenix above a flaming tower; it possibly symbolises the rebirth of the College after the fire of 1885.
The motto is &quot;Nid Byd, Byd Heb Wybodaeth&quot;: &quot;A World Without Knowledge, is No World At All&quot;.</p>
<h2>Reputation and academic rankings</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The Quadrangle (or 'Quad') in Old College.</a></p>
<p>The Times Good University Guide 2011 ranks Aberystwyth 40th overall out of 114 institutions in the UK.
In the same guide, the School of Law came 34th overall out of 87 Law Schools across the UK.</p>
<p>Aberystwyth is given 6th place in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> Supplement's &quot;Student Experience Rankings&quot;, a large survey of student satisfaction in their University ranging from teaching standards to social life.</p>
<p>The Computer science department has been ranked 17th in the United Kingdom, and first in Wales according to the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE 2008) with a 100% research quality profile.</p>
<p>The School of Management and Business is one of only 20 departments in the world to have its Masters degrees accredited by the <a>AMBA</a>.
It is similar to the <a>AACSB</a> in the U.S. and <a>EQUIS</a> in Europe.
Its MBA is also accredited by the same organisation.</p>
<p>The Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences was the first British university department to offer single honours degrees in human geography and physical geography, a course which has since been adopted by many other universities in the UK.
Aberystwyth was ranked 11th of 60 UK universities for Geography and Environmental Studies in the 2009 <em><a>Guardian</a></em> University Guide and, according to the 2009 Times Good University Guide, ranked the department at number 12 from 76 university geography and environmental science related departments.</p>
<p>The Department for International Politics was founded in 1919 and is the oldest such department in the world.</p>
<p>The University came under criticism in 2007 for its record on <a>sustainability</a>, with a ranking of 97th out of 106 UK higher education institutions in the &quot;<a>Green League 2007</a>&quot;.
However, the University has managed to climb up to 76th in Ranking for the revised Green League Table for 2009.</p>

<p><a>thumb|The Old College South Tower at the University.</a>
The Department of History and Welsh History, and the Institute of Mathematics and Physics can trace their beginnings back to the formation of the University in 1872.
The Department of Law was established in 1901 and, as such, is one of the oldest law schools in the UK.
The School of Art has a history stretching back to 1917 when it was part of the only British university concerned with the Art and Crafts Movement.
In 1936, it became a sub-department within the Education Department where, in 1965, the Joint Honours Art scheme was established.
Single Honours Art and Masters degree schemes were introduced in 1974, one year after the subject had once again been given autonomy as a university department.
Modern languages has been taught at Aberystwyth since c. 1874, making the current Department of European Languages one of the oldest departments in the UK to teach the subject.
The Department of Information &amp; Library Studies was founded in 1989 following the merger of the University with the <a>College of Librarianship Wales</a>.
The Institute of Biological Sciences was formed in 1993 from the Department of Biological Sciences, the Department of Biochemistry and the Genetics Group of the Department of Agricultural Botany.
These former departments, in turn, can trace their beginnings to the foundation of the University.
In 1993, budgetary considerations caused the University to permanently close its department of <a>philosophy</a>.
The efforts of some student philosophy organizations have so far failed to restore any funding for a philosophy department at Aberystwyth although there are a number of political philosophy related modules covered by the Department of International Politics.</p>

<h3>Department of Computer Science</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science at Aberystwyth was founded in 1970.
The department is known for its research in <a>Computational Biology</a> and <a>Robotics</a> </p>
<p>In the recent <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> (RAE 2008) the department came No. 17 in the <a>United Kingdom</a> for <a>Computer Science</a> and Informatics and No. 1 in <a>Wales</a> ahead of both Cardiff University and Swansea University.
Thus, the Department is the only such department in Wales that has been awarded a quality profile with 100% of its research being of international quality.
In the most recent Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) in 2008, where the Institute was ranked in the top 12 departments in Britain for Geography, with 20% of research classed as &quot;world leading&quot; and 45% classed as either &quot;world leading &quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot;.</p>
<h3>Department of Information Studies</h3>
<p>The <a>College of Librarianship Wales</a> (CLW) was established at <a>Llanbadarn Fawr</a> in 1964 in response to a recommendation for the training of bilingual librarians made in the Bourdillon Report on <em>Standards of public library service in England</em>, (H.M.S.O., 1962).
The College grew rapidly and became the largest institution for the training of librarians in Europe.
The independent College merged with the University in August 1989.
The new department has since introduced courses by open, part-time and <a>distance learning</a> to supplement full-time student numbers.</p>
<p>Since 1956 The University has also offered professional training in <a>archive</a> administration and <a>records management</a>, first as a Diploma course and since 1995 as a modular <a>Master's</a> course.
The course is run in partnership with the <a>National Library of Wales</a> and the Ceredigion Record Office, who contribute to the taught courses, support the practical work of the students and assist with research projects.</p>
<h3>Department of International Politics</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|The International Politics Building.</a>
In 1919, the world's first Department of International Politics was founded at Aberystwyth.
The department and the study of <a>international relations</a> itself was founded shortly after the <a>first world war</a> to further political understanding of the world in the hope of avoiding future conflicts.
This led to the creation of the <a>Woodrow Wilson</a> chair of International Politics.</p>
<p>Today, it is one of the largest departments of its kind in Europe, with an undergraduate student complement of 500 students and 120 postgraduates studying at <a>Masters Degree</a> and <a>PhD</a> level.
It has also scored high marks for both research and teaching, comparable to equivalent departments at <a>Oxford University</a>, <a>Cambridge University</a>, the <a>London School of Economics</a> and the POLSIS department of the <a>University of Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>The department has had various academic staff in the field including <a>E.
H. Carr</a>, <a>Leopold Kohr</a>, <a>Andrew Linklater</a>, <a>Ken Booth</a>, <a>Steve Smith</a> and <a>Michael Cox</a>.
In 2006, a new building for the Department of International Politics was completed and opened on the main Penglais Campus.</p>
<p>The department is also home to a number of journals.
These include &quot;Intelligence &amp; National Security&quot;, &quot;International Relations&quot; and &quot;Critical Studies on Terrorism&quot;</p>
<h3>Department of Law and Criminology</h3>
<p>The Department of Law and Criminology is housed in the Hugh Owen Building, which is located on the main campus.
This department was founded in 1901.
Ranked within the top twenty institutions for Law in the United Kingdom, it is the oldest law school in Wales and one of the oldest in the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, the Department is home to the specialist research centre, the <em>Centre for Welsh Legal Affairs</em>.
All lecturers in the Department are engaged in research and the <em>International Journal of Biosciences and the Law</em>, and the <em>Cambrian Law Review</em> are edited in the Department.
Over the years a large number of well-known legal academics, practitioners and politicians have taught in the Department.
Recently the Department has worked closely with the <a>Quality Assurance Agency</a> in testing new processes for teaching quality assessment.
The Department is one of only a few universities in the United Kingdom which offers the two-year <a>LL.B</a> scheme to graduates in a discipline other than law.
Information published in 2006 indicates a <a>progression rate</a> from first year to second year of about 93.5% on the LLB courses.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Department of Law &amp; Criminology started a <a>Legal Practice Course</a>.
The LPC is a requirement for anyone who wishes to practice as a <a>solicitor</a> in England and Wales.
The Times Good University Guide 2009 ranks its School of Law 34th overall out of 87 Law Schools across the UK.
Recently the school has been ranked 16th in Europe for accounting research by the Journal <em>Accounting and Business Research</em> and 22nd in Europe for Finance and Financial Economics by the <em>Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting</em>.
In the most recent subject specific teaching quality reviews the Accounting and Finance degrees schemes and the Economics degree schemes at Aberystwyth were both judged to be excellent, this is the highest category that can be awarded.
The research training masters are also <a>ESRC</a> 1+3 recognised.</p>
<h3>Department of Sport and Exercise Science</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2001 the Department of Sport and Exercise Science was established under Prof. Jo Doust, the department was then taken over by Prof. David Lavallee in 2007.
The Department of Sport and Exercise Science at Aberystwyth University delivers undergraduate programmes in sport and exercise science, performs research in the sport and exercise sciences, and provides consultancy services to individuals and organisations in Wales and the rest of the U.K.</p>
<p>The Department has seen much success in its short history, including academic success for students and staff/researchers.
For example recently Students have won the 2007 and 2008 British Psychological Society (BPS) Division of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology H.T.A. Whiting Undergraduate Dissertation Prize and there is a history of success (undergraduate and postgraduate prizes) for communications at the annual student conference of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES).</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>The department is active in research, and members of staff are involved in various projects including collaborative work with other Universities and organisations.
The department has made contributions to respiratory and endurance physiology, and the role of exercise in mental health and well-being.
Members of academic staff have an established record of publications in scientific journals, as well as contributing to book chapters, popular magazine articles and television and radio broadcasts on issues related to their research work.
In the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008, the Department of Sport and Exercise Science, which was returned for the first time since its formation in 2001, performed very well with 65% of research submitted rated as being recognised internationally and 15% being of international excellence.</p>
<h2>Geography of the University campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Sunset as seen from Constitution Hill.</a>
The main campus of the University is situated on Penglais Hill, overlooking the town of <a>Aberystwyth</a> and <a>Cardigan Bay</a>.
The Penglais Campus is the site of 12 of the University's 17 departments, as well as most of the student halls of residence.
Just below the Penglais Campus is the <a>National Library of Wales</a>, one of Britain's five <a>legal deposit</a> libraries.
A <a>BBC</a> article suggests the library is &quot;considered to be one of the world's greatest libraries, and its international reputation is certainly something that all Welsh men and women are intensely ... proud of&quot;.
The original university building, next to the sea, known as &quot;Old College&quot;, is the site of most of the University's administration as well as the Departments of Welsh and Education.
The Llanbadarn Campus is located approximately one mile to the east of the Penglais Campus, and hosts the Institute of Rural Sciences and the Department of Information Studies.
Additionally, the Llanbadarn Campus is the site of the Aberystwyth branch of <a>Coleg Ceredigion</a>, a further education college, and not part of the University.
The School of Art is located between the Penglais Campus and the centre of Aberystwyth, in what was originally the Edward Davies Chemical Laboratory, site of the now-defunct Department of Chemistry.</p>
<h2>Student residences</h2>
<p>The various student residences owned, leased or managed by the university offer almost 4,000 bed-spaces in total.
There are plans, however, to expand this to 5,450 spaces, with new residences to be built on land purchased in neighbouring Bow Street and a 'manor house' style residence to be built on undeveloped land at the student village site.
There is a mixture of halls and shared apartment-style accommodation.
All feature wired access to the University's computer network and a support network of wardening staff.</p>
