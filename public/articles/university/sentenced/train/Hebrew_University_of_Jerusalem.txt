The world's largest <a>Jewish studies</a> library is located on its Edmond J. Safra <a>Givat Ram</a> campus.

<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|180px|Inauguration ceremony, 1925</a> One of the visions of the <a>Zionist</a> movement was the establishment of a <a>Jewish</a> university in the <a>Land of Israel</a>.
Founding a university was proposed as far back as 1884 in the <a>Kattowitz (Katowice)</a> conference of the <a>Hovevei Zion</a> society.
A major supporter of the idea was <a>Albert Einstein</a>, who years later bequeathed his papers and his literary estate the to the university.
</p>
<p>The cornerstone for the university was laid in 1918.
Seven years later, on April 1, 1925, the Hebrew University campus on <a>Mount Scopus</a> was opened at a gala ceremony attended by the leaders of the Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the <a>Earl of Balfour</a>, Viscount <a>Allenby</a> and Sir <a>Herbert Samuel</a>.
The University's first Chancellor was <a>Judah Magnes</a>.
By 1947, the University had become a large research and teaching institution.
Plans for a medical school were approved in May 1949, and in November 1949, a faculty of law was inaugurated.
In 1952, it was announced that the agricultural institute founded by the University in 1940 would become a full-fledged faculty.
<a>thumb|left|Terra Sancta building, Jerusalem</a> During the <a>1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>, the Arabs repeatedly attacked convoys moving between the Israeli-controlled section of Jerusalem and the University.
The leader of the Arab forces in Jerusalem, <a>Abdul Kader Husseini</a>, threatened to blow up the University and  <a>Hadassah Hospital</a> &quot;if the Jews continued to use them as bases for attacks.&quot;
After the <a>Hadassah medical convoy massacre</a>, in which 79 doctors and nurses were murdered, the Mount Scopus campus was cut off from Jewish Jerusalem.
When the <a>Jordan</a>ian government reneged on the <a>1949 Armistice Agreements</a> and refused Israeli access to Mount Scopus, a new campus was built at Givat Ram in western Jerusalem and completed in 1958.
In the interim, classes were held in 40 different buildings around the city.
</p>
<p>The Terra Sancta building in <a>Rehavia</a>, rented from the Franciscan Custodians of the Latin Holy Places, was also used for this purpose.
A few years later, together with the <a>Hadassah</a> Medical Organization, a medical science campus was built in the south-west Jerusalem neighborhood of <a>Ein Kerem</a>.
By the beginning of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in <a>Rehovot</a>.
After the unification of Jerusalem, following the <a>Six-Day War</a> of June 1967, the University was able to return to Mount Scopus, which was rebuilt.
In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount Scopus again became the main campus of the University.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>

<h4>Mount Scopus</h4>
<p><a>Mount Scopus</a> (Hebrew: Har HaTzofim &#x05d4;&#x05e8; &#x05d4;&#x05e6;&#x05d5;&#x05e4;&#x05d9;&#x05dd;), in the north-eastern part of Jerusalem, is home to the Faculties of Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Jerusalem School of Business Administration, Bearwald School of Social Work, Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Rothberg International School and Mandel Institute of <a>Jewish Studies</a>  The Rothberg International School is located fifteen minutes from the Kfar Studentim (&#x05db;&#x05e4;&#x05e8; &#x05e1;&#x05d8;&#x05d5;&#x05d3;&#x05e0;&#x05d8;&#x05d9;&#x05dd;) campus that conveniently houses foreign students and Israeli natives outside Jerusalem.
The Rothberg International School features secular studies and Jewish/Israeli studies.
Included for foreign students is a mandatory Ulpan program for Hebrew language study that also includes a mandatory course on Israeli culture and customs.
All Rothberg Ulpan classes are taught by Israeli natives.
However, many secular studies class at the Rothberg School are taught by teachers not born in Ha' Aretz, but made Aliyah (Ascension) and are considered Israeli citizens.
The land on Mt.
Scopus was purchased before <a>World War I</a> from Sir John Gray-Hill, along with the Gray-Hill mansion.
The master plan for the university was designed by <a>Patrick Geddes</a> and his son-in-law, <a>Frank Mears</a> in December 1919.
Only three buildings of this original design were built: The Wolfson National Library, the Mathematics Institute and the Physics Institute.
and the Koret School of <a>Veterinary Medicine</a> are located in the city of <a>Rehovot</a> in the coastal plain.
The Faculty was established in 1942 and the School of Veterinary Medicine opened in 1985.
These are the only institutions of higher learning in Israel that offer both teaching and research programs in their respective fields.</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>The <a>Jewish National and University Library</a> is the central and largest library of the Hebrew University and one of the most impressive book and manuscript collections in the world.
It is also the oldest section of the university.
Founded in 1892 as a world center for the preservation of books relating to Jewish thought and culture, it assumed the additional functions of a general university library in 1920.
Its collections of <a>Hebraica</a> and <a>Judaica</a> are the largest in the world.
It houses all materials published in Israel, and attempts to acquire all materials published in the world related to the country.
It possesses over five million books and thousands of items in special sections, many of which are unique.
Among these are the <a>Albert Einstein</a> Archives, <a>Hebrew</a> <a>manuscripts</a> department, Eran Laor map collection, Edelstein science collection, <a>Gershom Scholem</a> collection, and a collection of <a>Maimonides</a>' manuscripts and early writings.

<p>In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the intellectual copyright to them, as well as the right to use his image.
The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items.</p>
<p>In addition to the National Library, the Hebrew University operates subject-based libraries on its campuses, among them the <a>Avraham Harman</a> Science Library, Safra, Givat Ram; Mathematics and Computer Science Library, Safra, Givat Ram; Earth Sciences Library, Safra, Givat Ram; Muriel and Philip I.

<h2>Terrorist attack</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Mount Scopus campus: Frank Sinatra building and memorial to the victims of the July 31, 2002 bombing</a></p>
<p>On July 31, 2002, an Arab painter, part of a <a>Hamas</a> terrorist cell, detonated a bomb during lunch hour at the University's &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; cafeteria when it was crowded with staff and students.
Nine people &#x2014; five Israelis, three Americans, and one citizen with dual French-American citizenship &#x2014; were murdered and more than 70 wounded.
World leaders, including <a>Kofi Annan</a>, <a>President Bush</a>, and the President of the European Union issued statements of condemnation.</p>
