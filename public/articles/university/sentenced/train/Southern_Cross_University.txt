<h2>History</h2>
<p> Southern Cross University was established on 1 January 1994, following the decentralisation of the network of the <a>University of New England, Australia</a> as a university with several campuses, which had been established in 1989.
The <a>University of New England</a>, continues to exist as a single campus in <a>Armidale, New South Wales</a>, as it had been established in 1954.
</p>
<p>The old college in <a>Lismore, New South Wales</a>, was the Lismore Teachers College, founded in 1971.
This institution was expanded and renamed the <a>Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education</a> in 1973.
Following the publication of the Australian Government's <a>White Paper</a> on Higher Education in 1988, with its emphasis on the development of larger institutions, the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education was sent into an association with the old University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales, and it formally became a network member of the newly constituted University of New England, under legislation that was enacted in 1989.</p>
<p>During 1992, in response to a proposal from the Board of Governors of the University of New England, the State and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for Higher Education established an Advisory Group to consider the implications of the Board of Governors' proposal that the network-style University of New England, Australia, be abolished, and that more than one new universities be established.</p>
<p>The Advisory Group recommended that a new university be established in the North Coast Region of New South Wales as an academically-integrated institution incorporating the two  University of New England network centres at <a>Northern Rivers, New South Wales</a> and <a>Coffs Harbour, New South Wales</a>, with the prospect of establishing additional North Coast centres as required.
The Advisory Group also proposed that the new university develop under the sponsorship/supervision of a major metropolitan university for its first three years, while operating under its own name and with its own Council, and awarding its own degrees.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and State Government Ministers jointly appointed an Implementation Advisory Panel to advise on the strategies necessary to give effect to the proposed new structures and announced that the successor institutions to the University of New England network would be established in time for the 1994-95 academic year.
The University of New England, remains where it had originally been, in Armidale, New South Wales, as a single campus.</p>
<p>On 29 June 1993, the Commonwealth Department for Employment, Education, and Training and the <a>New South Wales Department of Education and Training</a> announced the outcome of the joint Commonwealth/State review of the continued offering of higher education in northern New South Wales.
The announcement included the decision that a new university would be established on the North Coast of New South Wales, which would consist of campuses at Lismore, New South Wales (formerly the University of New England, Australia-Northern Rivers) and at Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (formerly the University of New England-Coffs Harbour Centre).
It was later announced that the new college would be called the Southern Cross University.
Legislation was passed by both houses of the <a>Government of New South Wales</a> Parliament in October 1993.</p>
