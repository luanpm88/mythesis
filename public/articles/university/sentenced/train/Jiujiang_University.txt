<p>The <strong>Jiujiang University</strong> (<a>Chinese</a>: &#x4e5d;&#x6c5f;&#x5b66;&#x9662;; <a>Pinyin</a>: Ji&#x01d4;ji&#x0101;ng Xu&#x00e9;yu&#x00e0;n) is a major college in <a>Jiujiang</a>, northern <a>Jiangxi Province</a> in <a>China</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jiujiang University is a comprehensive public university authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, enrolling students from 30 provinces of China with many different backgrounds.
Its history can be traced back to 1901 when it existed as Danforth Hospital Nursing School.</p>
<p>The university was formed out of the merger of what had been the four local Jiujiang colleges: <strong>Jiujiang Teacher's College</strong>, <strong>Jiujiang Medical College</strong>, <strong>Jiujiang Vocational College</strong>, and <strong>Jiujiang Financial and Economic College</strong>.
Although the merger was planned as early as 2001, it was not carried out until after 2006.</p>
<p>Jiujiang University has four campuses covering an area of about 184 hectares with a total space of buildings being 780,000 square meters.
There are over 30,000 full-time Chinese students, with over 200 foreign students, 1683 full-time teachers, 21 faculties or colleges offering a total of 159 programs and a library collecting over 2.46 million books.</p>
<p>Jiujiang University is one of the 25 Chinese Language Education Centres approved by Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs under the State Council of P. R. China.
Jiujiang University has been entitled to enrolling overseas students and established collaborative relationship with universities of more than 10 countries around the world.</p>
<p>In October 1980, the 10th military meeting of the Central Military Committee eliminated the department of enterprise administration, a rear-service school of the <a>People's Liberation Army</a>, and replaced it with a cadre school for enterprise.
On September 21, 1981, the PLA Enterprise Cadre School was established.</p>
<p>In September 1982, the school began its first training classes.
At the beginning of 1983, the <a>Jiangxi</a> provincial government brought the enrollment plan of the school into line with the state plan.</p>
<p>In March 1994, the National Education Committee approved the establishment of the <strong>Jiujiang Financial and Economic College</strong>, the added name <strong>Military Supplies Finance and Economics College of the PLA</strong> added in April of the same year.
The two names have since been used in parallel.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>In 2006, the leadership of the college was as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gan Xiaoqing  (&#x7518;&#x7b71;&#x9752;), president and vice-secretary of the CPC Central Committee</li>
  <li>Chen Mianshui  (&#x9648;&#x7ef5;&#x6c34;), secretary of the CPC Central Committee</li>
  <li>Ouyang Maorong (&#x6b27;&#x9633;&#x6bdb;&#x8363;), vice-secretary of the CPC Central Committee</li>
  <li>Zhao Wenjie   (&#x8d75;&#x6587;&#x6770;), vice-president</li>
  <li>Wu Taoe (&#x5434;&#x6843;&#x5a25;), vice-president</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aliases</h2>
<p>The <strong>Jiujiang Financial and Economic College</strong> is properly known as <strong>Jiujiang Institute</strong> (&#x4e5d;&#x6c5f;&#x5b66;&#x9662;).
It often refers to itself as <strong>Jiujiang University</strong> <em>in English only</em> as a result of some confusion surrounding differences in educational instite organization between China and English-speaking countries.
The &quot;Institute&quot; level is a level in between a trade school and a full-fledged university which doesn't have an equivalent in most western countries.
As a result there can be confusion when the name &quot;Jiujiang Institute&quot; is used and it is deemed simpler to use &quot;Jiujiang University&quot; instead.
You can find this behavior in all &#x5b66;&#x9662;-level institutions in China.</p>
