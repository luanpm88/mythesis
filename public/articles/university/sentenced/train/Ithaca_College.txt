<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Ithaca College was founded as the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892 when a local violin teacher, William Grant Egbert, rented four rooms and arranged for the instruction of eight students.
For nearly seven decades the institution flourished in the city of Ithaca, adding to its music curriculum the study of elocution, dance, physical education, speech correction, radio, business, and the liberal arts.
In 1931 the conservatory was chartered as a private college.
The college was originally housed in the <a>Boardman House</a>, that later became the Ithaca College Museum of Art, and it was listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1971.</p>
<h3>Modern era</h3>
<p>[[Image:ICtextorball.JPG|thumb|300px|&quot;Textor Ball,&quot; a [[modern art]] sculpture on the roof of the Textor lecture halls.]]
By 1960, some 2,000 students were in attendance.
A modern campus was built on South Hill in the sixties, and students were shuttled between the old and new during the construction.
The hillside campus continued to grow in the ensuing 30 years to accommodate more than 6,000 students.</p>
<p>As the campus expanded, the college also began to expand its curriculum.
By the 1990s, some 2,000 courses in more than 100 programs of study were available in the college's five schools.</p>
<p>The school attracts a multicultural student body with representatives from almost every state and from 78 foreign countries.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Ithaca College's current campus was built in the 1960s on <a>South Hill</a>.
In 1968 the College's final academic department moved to the South Hill campus from downtown, making the move complete.</p>
<h4>Satellite Campuses</h4>
<p>Besides its Ithaca campus, Ithaca College also operates satellite campuses in <a>London, UK</a>; <a>Washington, D.C.</a>; <a>Los Angeles, CA</a> (James B. Pendleton Center); and <a>Antigua</a>.
</p>
<p>Ithaca College also operates direct enrollment exchange programs with several universities, including <a>Griffith University</a>, <a>La Trobe University</a>, <a>Murdoch University</a>, and <a>University of Tasmania</a> (Australia); <a>Chengdu Sport University</a> and <a>Beijing Sport University</a> (China); <a>University of Hong Kong</a>; <a>Masaryk University</a> (Czech Republic); <a>Akita International University</a> and <a>University of Tsukuba</a> (Japan); <a>Hanyang University</a> (Korea); <a>Nanyang Technological University</a> (Singapore); <a>University of Valencia</a> (Spain); and <a>J&#x00f6;nk&#x00f6;ping University</a> (Sweden).</p>

<h3>Media and publications</h3>
<p><a>upright|thumb|An issue of <em>The Ithacan</em></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>The Ithacan</em></strong> is Ithaca College's official newspaper.
The paper is written, edited and published by students.
<em>The Ithacan</em> is available in print every Thursday morning and online.
<em>The Ithacan</em> and its staff have won many major collegiate journalism awards, most notably, the Associated Collegiate Press' <a>National Pacemaker Award</a>, which it has won five times, most recently in 2008.
The Pacemaker has been widely considered the Pulitzer Prize of collegiate journalism.</li>
<li><strong><em><a>Ithaca College Television (ICTV)</a></em></strong> is the student operated television channel that has broadcast since 1958.</li>
<li><strong><em><a>WICB</a></em></strong> is an FCC-licensed station that operates at 7500 Watts at 91.7 on the FM band.
The majority of its programming falls under the modern rock category.
While broadcasting modern rock, the station is run similarly to a commercial modern rock station, with the inclusion of playlists planned by the programming and music departments that include leeway for listener requests and DJ choices.
The station was recently honored with the <a>MTVU</a> <a>Woodie Award</a> for Best College Radio Station.
Other programming ranges from mainstream hip-hop and R&amp;B, to underground, downtempo, and other lesser-known genres of what is generally considered urban music.
In addition to a lunchtime Jazz show, WICB broadcasts a number of other specialty shows throughout the week.
These shows, which usually run 2&#x2013;3 hours in length, come from genres such as blues, broadway, jam band music, and &quot;homeless&quot; music, that is not normally heard on the public airwaves.</li>
<li><strong><em>Buzzsaw Magazine</em></strong>, formerly Buzzsaw Haircut, was founded in 1997 and is the college's monthly alternative news magazine.
It is available in print and online every month.
The magazine is produced by the Ithaca College community and printed by Our Press of <a>Binghamton, NY</a>.
It is funded by the Ithaca College Student Government Association, the Park School of Communication, local advertising, community support, and a grant from <a>Campus Progress</a>.
It has won a number of national awards, including the Campus Alternative Journalism Project's award for &quot;Best Sense of Humor&quot; in 2003 and the Independent Press Association's Campus Independent Journalism Awards for &quot;Best Campus Publication with a Budget Under $10,000&quot; and &quot;Best Political Commentary&quot; in 2005.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>Historically, various independent and national <a>fraternities and sororities</a> had active chapters at Ithaca College.
However, due to a series of highly publicized <a>hazing</a> incidents in the 1980s, including one that was responsible for the death of a student, the College administration removed all but five Greek letter organizations from campus, and adopted a non-expansion policy, prohibiting any new Greek houses from affiliating with the College.
As of 2008, three recognized Greek organizations remain on campus, all of which are music oriented:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> (Delta Chapter)</li>
  <li><a>Sigma Alpha Iota</a> (Epsilon Chapter)</li>
  <li><a>Mu Phi Epsilon</a> (Lambda Chapter)</li>
  <li><a>Delta Phi Zeta</a> (Inactive)</li>
  <li>A fifth, performing arts oriented house, [[Kappa Gamma Psi] (Iota Chapter)], went inactive in 2008 due to insufficient membership on campus after Ithaca College refused to grant them an extension to allow interested freshman to pledge the following semester.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are various Greek Letter Organizations at Ithaca College that are unaffiliated with the school, and therefore not subject to the same housing privileges or rules that contribute to the safety of their members such as non-hazing and non-drinking policies.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Gamma Delta Pi</a></li>
  <li><a>Phi Kappa Sigma</a> (Gamma Chi Chapter)</li>
  <li>Phi Mu Zeta</li>
</ul>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The Ithaca athletics nickname &quot;Bombers&quot; is unique in <a>NCAA</a> athletics, and the origins of the nickname are obscure.
Ithaca College's sports teams were originally named the Cayugans, but the name was changed to the Bombers sometime in the 1930s.
Several possibilities for the change have been posited.
It may have made reference to the <a>New York Yankees</a>, who are known as the Bronx Bombers, or (less likely) boxer <a>Joe Louis</a>, known as the Brown Bomber.
The most common explanation is that the school's baseball uniforms - white with navy blue pinstripes and an interlocking &quot;IC&quot; on the left chest - bear a striking resemblance to the distinctive home uniforms of the New York Yankees.
It may also have referred to the Ithaca basketball team of that era and its propensity for half-court &quot;bombs.&quot;
<a>Grumman</a> Aircraft also manufactured airplanes including bombers in Ithaca for many years.
The first &#x201c;Bombers&#x201d; reference on record was in the December 17, 1938 issue of the <a>Rochester Times-Union</a> in a men&#x2019;s basketball article.</p>
<p>The name has at times sparked controversy for its perceived martial connotations.
It is an occasional source of umbrage from Ithaca's prominent <a>pacifist</a> community, but the athletics department has consistently stated it has no interest in changing the name.
for 27 years, the football team has won three <a>NCAA Division III National Football Championship</a>s in 1979, 1988 and 1991 (a total surpassed only by <a>Augustana</a> and <a>Mount Union</a>).
Bomber football teams made a record seven appearances in the Division III national championship game, the <a>Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl</a>, which has since been surpassed by Mount Union in 2003.
The Bombers play the <a>SUNY Cortland</a> Red Dragons for the <a>Cortaca Jug</a>, which was added in 1959 to an already competitive rivalry.
The matchup is one of the most prominent in <a>Division III</a> college football.</p>
<p>Most recently, the women's crew won back-to-back NCAA Division III championships in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p>Women's soccer has won two national championships in Division III and is consistently ranked in the top 20 nationally.</p>
<p>The Men's Wrestling team won NCAA Division III National Championships in 1989, 1990 and 1994.</p>
<p>Ithaca is also home to more than 60 club sports, many of which compete regularly against other colleges in leagues and tournaments.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>Ithaca's School of Business was the first college or university business school in the world to achieve LEED Platinum Certification.
The College composts its dining hall waste, runs a &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; Green move-out program, and offers a sustainable living option.
It also operates an office supply collection and reuse program, as well as a <a>sustainability education</a> program during new student orientation.
Ithaca received a B- grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2009 College Sustainability Report Card  and an A- for 2010.</p>
<h2>Presidents</h2>
<h3>Current president</h3>
<p>Ithaca's current president is Thomas Rochon.
Thomas Rochon was named the eighth president of Ithaca College on April 11, 2008.
Rochon took over as president of the college following Peggy Williams, who had announced on July 12, 2007 that she would retire from the presidency post effective May 31, 2009 following a one-year sabbatical.</p>
