<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>London College of Communication</strong> (<strong>LCC</strong>) (formerly the <strong>London College of Printing</strong>, and briefly <strong>London College of Printing and Distributive Trades</strong>) is a constituent college of the <a>University of the Arts London</a>.
The college is located in <a>Elephant and Castle</a>, <a>South London</a>, and was originally based in <a>Waterloo</a>.
It specialises in <a>media</a> and <a>design</a> courses, such as <a>publishing</a>, <a>print</a>, and <a>graphic design</a>.
The college is one of the seven national <a>Skillset</a> Screen Academies.
</p>
<p>In 1967, the <a>North Western Polytechnic</a> (now <a>London Metropolitan University</a>) printing department transferred to the College.</p>
<p>In 2007, the college established the <a>Stanley Kubrick Archive</a>, based on the collection of film director <a>Stanley Kubrick</a>.
Since 2005 the LCC has hosted the annual <a>Hugh Cudlipp</a> lecture.</p>
<h2>Affiliations</h2>
<p>The London College of Communication is a sister college of <a>Camberwell College of Arts</a>, <a>Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design</a>, <a>Chelsea College of Art and Design</a>, <a>London College of Fashion</a> and <a>Wimbledon College of Art</a>.</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>LCC is one of the oldest schools of journalism in the UK; students write and produce the university newspaper <em>Arts London News</em> as part of their studies, and this also now appears as an online edition [<a>http://www.artslondonnews.co.uk</a>].</p>
<h2>Cutbacks and closures</h2>
<p>LCC was the site of student protests and sit-ins in November 2009, as students expressed anger over proposed course closures and staff redundancies.
Approximately 100 students tried to occupy the office of Sandra Kemp, the head of the college, in protest over what one student said was lack of supervision for dissertations.
</p>
<p>The director of the university's course in <a>public relations</a> resigned over the proposed cutbacks, asserting that the cutbacks meant there was insufficient staff to provide the necessary teaching on the course.
Much of the teaching is now to be supplied by sessional lecturers on short-term contracts, and a member of the teaching staff asserts that sackings have resulted in cancelled lectures and students being left without dissertation supervisors.</p>
