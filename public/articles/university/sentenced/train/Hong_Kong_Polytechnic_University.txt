<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1937 as the <strong>Government Trade School</strong>.
Situated in Wood Road, <a>Wanchai</a>, the School was the first publicly funded, post-secondary technical institution in <a>Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>After <a>World War II</a>, the School became the <strong>Hong Kong Technical College</strong> in 1947, offering both full-time and part-time courses.
The year 1957 saw the opening of the new premises of the College in <a>Hung Hom</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Hong Kong Polytechnic</strong> was formally established on 1 August 1972, taking over the campus and staff of the Hong Kong Technical College.
Its <a>mandate</a> was to provide professionally-oriented <a>education</a>.</p>
<p>Having gained approval from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee for self-accreditation of degree programmes, the Institution assumed full university status on 25 November 1994, changing its name to <strong>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, PolyU is an institution of higher learning and offers more than 130 <a>postgraduate</a>, <a>undergraduate</a> and sub-degree programmes, supported by more than 1,000 academic and research staff members from different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p><strong>Among the top 200 universities in the world</strong></p>
<p>In the 2010 ranking of the world's universities by QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited [<a>http://www.topuniversities.com/</a>],
PolyU (the university as a whole) is ranked 166th in the WORLD in 2010, versus 198th in 2009.
In THES's 2010-2011 ranking, PolyU is ranked 149.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Engineering Research</strong></p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by <a>Thomson Scientific</a> in 2006, an established authority in compiling <a>Science Citation Index</a>, PolyU has been ranked number one in the world on the number of papers published in leading journals from 2003 to 2005 in the field of <a>civil engineering</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>School of HTM</strong></p>
<p>PolyU's <a>School of Hotel and Tourism Management</a> is ranked No. 2 in the world based on research and scholarship, according to a study released in the international <a>Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research</a> in November 2009, the only non-<a>US</a> based institution on the top-five list.
Besides, the School was the recipient of 2003 Institutional Achievement Award from International Society of Travel and Tourism Educators for enhancing <a>tourism</a> <a>education</a> in Asia and innovativeness in student admission, curriculum design and industry partnerships.
The School's strength is its international scope.
Its faculty of 60 dedicated <a>academic staff</a> drawn from 18 countries around the world gives the School an international, innovative and creative learning environment.
As the anticipation builds for the opening of its teaching and research hotel, <a>Hotel ICON</a>, in early  2011, the School expects ever-enhanced levels of excellence in the years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>School of Design</strong></p>
<p>Surveys by the <a>US</a> magazine <a>BusinessWeek</a> in 2006 &amp; 2007 showed that PolyU's <a>School of Design</a> ranked among the top 60 in the world and among the ten best in <a>Asia</a>.
In 2009, the magazine further rated the School's Master of Design (Design Strategies) program as one of the World's 30 Best Design Thinking programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty of Business</strong></p>
<p>PolyU's Graduate School of <a>Business</a> is ranked <a>66th in a worldwide ranking</a> of business schools conducted by the <a>University of Texas at Dallas</a> (UTD) in the <a>US</a>.
The ranking was based on the research contributions of staff to leading business journals during 2004-2008.</p>

<p>In 2010, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#x2019;s Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)[<a>http://www.arwu.org/index.jsp</a>]
ranks PolyU as the world's top 75 in &quot;Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences&quot;.
This places PolyU among the world's top 100 universities in the disciplines of engineering and information technology.
PolyU's score is 69.2 for &#x201c;Papers Indexed in Science Citation Index - Expanded in ENG fields&#x201d;.
For comparison, CityU has 65.4,
HKUST has 55.5, CUHK has 44.8.
HKU's is unknown because HKU is not among the world's top 100.
This ranking accounts for (i) highly cited researchers, (ii) papers indexed in Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE), (iii) percentage of papers published in the top 20% journals of each field, among other objective factors.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> (QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited,[<a>http://www.topuniversities.com/</a>]),
PolyU is ranked 70th in the WORLD, for &quot;Technology and Engineering&quot;.

That ranking employs objective indicators that evaluate both quantity and quality of a university&#x2019;s scientific papers, and incorporates the assessment of long-term and short-term achievements in the composite measures.</p>
<p><strong>Accountancy and Finance</strong></p>
<p>The research output of PolyU's School of <a>Accounting</a> and <a>Finance</a> has been <a>ranked second</a> in the <a>Asia-Pacific</a> region, according to the November 2005 issue of the <a>Pacific-Basin Finance Journal</a>.

<h2>Library</h2>
<p><a>Pao Yue-kong Library</a> was established on August 1, 1972 to serve the then Hong Kong Polytechnic.
Between 1973 and 1976, Library services were provided at two centres, one at the present University site at Hung Hom and one at the Quarry Bay Centre.
The two centres were consolidated when they were moved to the present Library Building in 1976.
On November 25, 1994, the Polytechnic assumed full university status and was renamed The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
On December 20, 1995, the University Library was officially named after the late Sir Yue-kong Pao in appreciation of a generous donation to the University by his family.
Opened by Princess Alexandra on February 7, 1977, the Library Building is a six-storey purpose-designed building with an area of 16,662 square metres, providing approximately 3,623 study places.
The Library also houses a 24-Hour Study Centre, group discussion rooms, a seminar room for library instruction classes, AV carrels and group rooms for use of audio-visual materials, study carrels for private study, and a special room for the visually disabled.</p>
<p>The Library comprises one of the largest collections of scientific, engineering and business materials in East Asia.
Other areas of strength are information technology, computing, nursing, textiles and design.
The present holdings exceed 2.2 million, to which more than 40,000 volumes are added annually.
Over 4,100 active print serial titles are held in the Library.
The Library also provides Internet access to over 32,610 unique full-text e-journal titles, almost 225,100 e-books, and a wide array of multi-media and e-learning programmes.</p>
<p>The Library also maintains several special collections and self-developed databases, including a comprehensive Standards Collection, the PolyU Examination Paper Database, the PolyU Course Scheme Database, the Senate Paper Database, a Digital Image Gallery, and a Slide Collection.
In addition, a unique and heavily used collection of over 24,000 local Chinese and English language television programmes and the Hongkongiana Online database (an index to Hong Kong information found in periodicals published in Hong Kong) all constitute important resources for the study and research of Hong Kong.</p>
