<p><strong>Fuller Theological Seminary</strong>  is an <a>accredited</a> Christian educational institute with its main campus in <a>Pasadena, California</a> and several satellite campuses in the Western United States.
The school is &quot;arguably the most influential, by number of pastors and educators trained...&quot; </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fuller Theological Seminary was founded in 1947 by <a>Charles E. Fuller</a>, a radio evangelist known for his &quot;Old Fashioned Revival Hour&quot; show, and <a>Harold Ockenga</a>, the pastor of <a>Park Street Church</a> in <a>Boston</a>.
With its founding, the seminary's founders sought to reform <a>fundamentalism</a> from its separatist and sometimes anti-intellectual stance of the 1920-40 era.
Fuller envisaged that the seminary would become &quot;a <a>Caltech</a> of the evangelical world.&quot;</p>
<h2>Theology and academics</h2>
<p>Fuller is accredited by the <a>Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada</a> and the <a>Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.
Fuller's student body of more than 4,000 includes students from more than 70 countries and 100 denominational backgrounds.</p>
<p>Fuller admits evangelicals from both conservative and liberal perspectives.</p>
<h2>Schools and degrees</h2>
<p>Fuller Theological Seminary is organized into three schools of theology, psychology, and intercultural studies.
The seminary emphasizes the integration of the three and many students take courses in more than one school.
The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
