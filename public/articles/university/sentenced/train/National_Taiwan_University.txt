<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>NTU offers the <a>bachelor's degree</a>, <a>master's degree</a>, and <a>doctorate degree</a> in many disciplines.
Students are given the flexibility to select courses offered by any colleges; however, compulsory subjects designated for each major needs to be completed to be awarded a degree.
A student must declare a major during college application, some majors are more competitive than others and require a higher national examination score.
Traditionally, <a>medicine</a>, <a>electrical engineering</a>, and <a>law</a> are the three most selective majors.
Most majors take four years to complete while the medical degree takes seven years to finish.</p>
<p>NTU requires most of its undergraduate students to take a mandatory <a>core curriculum</a>, comprising Chinese, freshman English, physical education, and public service.
The medical school in addition dictates each of its students to take <a>philosophy</a> and <a>sociology</a> classes as well as seminars in <a>ethics</a> and <a>thanatology</a>.
<a>Military training</a> is no longer an obligatory course for males, but it is a prerequisite if the student plans to be an officer during his mandatory military service.</p>
