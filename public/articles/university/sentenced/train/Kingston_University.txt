<p>There are the usual facilities on the main campus for printing, health and fitness, shops and cafes.
A free bus service for students runs between the campuses and Kingston town centre.</p>
<h3>Kingston Hill</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Kingston Hill campus, Kingston University</a> This campus underwent a major redevelopment in 1997.
With its own halls and numerous car parks (including the main seven storey car park) Kingston Hill mainly caters to Nursing, Law, Education, Business, Music, Health and Social Sciences.
Located near the top of Kingston Hill, it connects to the other campus sites by use of a free University Bus service.
Recent development at this site has seen an extension to the current Learning Resources Centre.
Massive construction projects took place and recently a new modern building in memory on John Galsworthy was finished.
Prior to 1989, this campus was known as Gipsy Hill.</p>
<p>The music department is situated in Coombehurst House, which was once owned by <a>Florence Nightingale</a>'s aunt and uncle.
Nightingale was a frequent visitor to the house and indeed the new Learning Resource Centre on Kingston Hill was named the Nightingale Centre after her.</p>
<h3>Knights Park</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Knights Park campus</a> This campus, located on Grange Road, close to Penrhyn Road, is the home of the University's Faculty of Art, Design &amp; Architecture, and provides undergraduate courses in Architecture, Art &amp; Design History, Interior Design, Product &amp; Furniture, Graphic Design, Photography, Illustration &amp; Animation, Fine Art and Fashion amongst others.
The facility also features a student bar, caf&#x00e9; and arts library.

<h3>National Student Survey exaggeration</h3>
<p>In 2008, an audio recording obtained by student media included two psychology lecturers asking students to inflate their graded opinions given as part of the <a>National Student Survey</a>.
One member of staff was recorded as encouraging students to boost specific satisfaction scores, because &quot;if Kingston comes down the bottom [of the league tables], then the bottom line is that nobody is going to want to employ you because they are going to think your degree is shit&quot;.
In response, Vice-Chancellor Peter Scott confirmed that the recording was genuine but added that he believed that the incident was an isolated one.
In July 2008, the Higher Education Funding Council of England removed the University's Department of Psychology of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from the League Tables for the year as its sanction for having fraudulently manipulated the National Student Survey results.</p>
<h3>External examiner controversy</h3>
<p>In 2008, the <a>BBC</a> obtained e-mails circulated within Kingston's School of Music, relating to the opinions of an <a>external examiner</a> moderating the BMus course.
The messages showed that her final report caused considerable concern within the department.
The examiner was persuaded to moderate her criticism following contact from a member of the University's staff.
The e-mails also detailed a plan to replace her (at the end of her term) with a more experienced and broad-based external examiner, a process which Kingston stressed breaks no rules relating to the appointment of such examiners.</p>
