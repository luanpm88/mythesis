<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ESADE project was conceived in the spring of 1954 by a group of Spanish professionals and entrepreneurs who later founded the university.
The school signed an agreement with the <a>Jesuits</a> (<a>Societas Iesu</a>) in October 1958 and started offering its first academic programs in a small building in the district of <a>Sant Gervasi, Barcelona</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, ESADE has steadily grown in size and the range of courses has led to the extension of its installations to create a campus which, if the premises in both <a>Madrid</a> and <a>Barcelona</a> are included, currently covers an area of 30,000m2.
A new executive centre was opened in 2003 in <a>Buenos Aires, Argentina</a>: the Foundation for Business and Social Development.
ESADE has also inaugurated the <a>ESADE Creapolis</a>, a new campus situated in <a>Sant Cugat del Vall&#x00e8;s</a>.</p>
