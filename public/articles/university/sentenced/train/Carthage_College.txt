<h2>History</h2>
<p>German Lutherans founded Carthage in 1847 in <a>Hillsboro, Illinois</a> as The Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church of the Far West.
In 1852 the college moved to <a>Springfield, Illinois</a> and operated under the name <a>Illinois State University</a>.
However, the college closed in 1869 due to budgetary reasons.
In 1870 the college was reopened as Carthage College in <a>Carthage, Illinois</a>.
Due to dwindling enrollment numbers during the 1950s, Carthage decided to open another campus in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1962, intending to eventually relocate the college there.
The Wisconsin and Illinois campuses ran simultaneously until 1964, when the Illinois campus closed its doors and the college and its old traditions were moved to Wisconsin.
This was the cause of much discontent among students at the Illinois campus who were long under the impression that the Illinois and Wisconsin campuses would both be operated by Carthage.</p>
<p>During the 2000s, a new state-of-the-art library (Hedberg Library) and athletic center (Tarble Athletic and Recreation Center) have been opened, the old library was turned into the Clausen Center for World Business, and the former Physical Education Center was rebuilt and renamed the Tarble Arena.
The Oaks, the new student village overlooking Lake Michigan, features semi-private suites and a media lounge on each floor.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Carthage claims a long-standing commitment to educating the whole person by nourishing the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, social, and physical dimensions of students' lives.
The College's stated mission is to offer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a curriculum that challenges students to think critically and express themselves effectively</li>
  <li>a campus life that encourages involvement and service</li>
  <li>a community of faith that nurtures spiritual growth and develops moral responsibility</li>
  <li>co-curricular activities that inspire students to test their own limits and express their individuality.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Without question the most successful program at Carthage College has been its Men's Baseball Team, led by Augie Schmidt IV.
The Men's Baseball team has established themselves as a Division III powerhouse averaging over 35 wins/season from 1990-2010 with an overall record of 702-237 during this timespan.
They have been invited to the NCAA Division III World Series multiple times, finishing 3rd in 2009.
The Baseball Team typically has at least 1 All-American and has had multiple pleayers drafted within the past few years (Jeff Livek- 2008, NY Yankees).

<p>Augie Schmidt III- In 23 seasons, Schmidt has transformed the Red Men from CCIW basement-dwellers to national contenders.
Under his tenure, Carthage has claimed eight outright CCIW divisional titles, one divisional-title tie, nine conference crowns, 16 NCAA regional berths, including nine-straight from 1992&#x2013;2000, six regional titles, third-place finishes in both the 1993 and 1994 NCAA Division III Baseball Championships and fourth place in both 1995 and 1997.
For his efforts, Schmidt has been named American Baseball Coaches Association/Diamond Sports NCAA Division III Central Regional &quot;Coach Of The Year&quot; nine times (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009), won the ABCA/Louisville Slugger Conference Award seven times from 1993&#x2013;99, and has been named CCIW &quot;Baseball Coach of the Year&quot; on 10 occasions (1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009).

<p>In 2004, the Redmen football team set a school record for most wins in a season going 11-2.
That season was also the first time the Redmen made the NCAA Division III playoffs since the school joined the NCAA in 1976.
Carthage would go on to win their first two games of the playoffs beating Alma College in Alma, Michigan 31-28 and then defeating Wooster College in Wooster, Ohio 14-7.
The Redmen then traveled to face the number one team in Division III football, Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio.
The teams were back and forth for around three quarters but Carthage was overpowered in the fourth quarter and lost 38-20.
The Redmen finished the season ranked 5th in the nation according to the D3football.com
website.</p>
<p>In 2005, the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) ruled that Carthage, along with several other colleges, would be ineligible to host NCAA-sanctioned playoffs and tournaments because their nickname, &quot;Redmen&quot;, was perceived as an offensive reference to <a>Native Americans</a>.</p>
<p>Recently a decision was made to rename the Carthage men's teams the &quot;Red Men&quot;.
This is in accordance with the circa 1920 origin of the name&#x2014;the team's red uniform jersey&#x2014;while removing any possible controversial connotations.
In conjunction with the rearticulation of the name, a new logo for the team replaced the traditional feathered Carthage C. It includes a torch, a shield, and a C.</p>
<p>Carthage College was a member of the <a>Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1912-1941.</p>
