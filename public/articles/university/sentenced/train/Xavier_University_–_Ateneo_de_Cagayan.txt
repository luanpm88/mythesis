<p>  :<em>Not to be confused with <a>Xavier School</a>.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Xavier University &#x2013; Ateneo de Cagayan</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>Roman Catholic</a> <a>university</a> run by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> in <a>Cagayan de Oro</a>, <a>Philippines</a>.</p>
<p>It was founded on <a>June 7</a>, <a>1933</a> as the <em>Ateneo de Cagayan</em> by an American Jesuit missionary, <a>Fr.
James T.G.
Hayes, S.J., D.D.</a>, who later became the first <a>Archbishop of Cagayan de Oro</a>.
In 1958, Ateneo de Cagayan became a university and was renamed to its present name, Xavier University, in honor of the Jesuit missionary, <a>St.
Francis Xavier</a>.</p>
<p>There were at least two attempts by the alumni of the then <em>Ateneo de Cagayan</em> to revert the name of the University to <em>Ateneo de Cagayan</em>.
The first attempt was in the mid 1990's and the second attempt was in 2007.
These attempts were, however, not widely supported and in the case of the 2007 proposal, not endorsed by the Xavier University &#x2013; Ateneo Alumni Association (XU&#x2013;AAA).
Until today, the debate still continues.</p>
<p>The official student publication of Xavier University is <em><a>The Crusader</a></em>.
Its supreme student government is the <a>Xavier University - Central Student Government</a>.</p>
<h2>Alma Mater Hymn</h2>
<p>The Xavier University alma mater hymn, &quot;Xavier, Alma Mater&quot; was composed and written by <a>Fr.
Eduardo P. Hontiveros, S.J.</a> (1923&#x2013;2008).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Xavier University was founded on June 7, 1933 as <em>Ateneo de Cagayan</em>, with only 17 First-year high school students.</p>
<p>It was founded by the <a>Most Reverend James T.G.
Hayes, S.J., D.D.</a>, who is the first Bishop and Archbishop of Cagayan de Oro.
It was firstly located at Burgos Street, where the former St. Augustine Parochial School was also located.</p>
<p>Cagayan de Oro, then Cagayan de Misamis, with a population of around 50,000, had the finest port in Mindanao and was a fast-growing town.
Gradually, the school grew with the community and opened college courses in June 1938, and Grades 5 to 7 in June 1940 to accommodate requests from parents all over Mindanao and Visayas.</p>
<h3>World War II</h3>
<p>It was then moved to its present location in Corrales Avenue.
It eventually grew into a college and offered courses in <a>Liberal Arts</a>, <a>Education</a> and <a>Commerce</a>.
The school closed down on December 9, 1941, with only 614 students.
It subsequently became the headquarters of the <a>Imperial Japanese Army</a> in <a>Mindanao</a> on <a>May 2</a> <a>1942</a>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 1944, <a>U.S.
Air Force</a> planes swooped in and bombed most of Cagayan de Misamis into piles of rubble, even for the school itself.
Fr.
Edward J. Haggerty, S.J., then <a>Rector</a> and Military Vicar to the U.S. Armed Forces from <a>Borneo</a> to <a>Okinawa</a>, wrote these words in his diary:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fr.
Haggerty was awarded the U.S. <a>Bronze Star</a> medal on February 21, 1947 for his services as a volunteer chaplain of the Visayas-Mindanao Force during the war years.
He also became adviser to <a>Fertig's</a> Guerrilla Government.
Fr.
Haggerty and his successor, Fr.
Andrew F. Cervini, S.J., worked to reconstruct the school, and in 1946 regular classes recommenced.
This was only interrupted again after the eruption of <a>Mt.
Hibok-Hibok</a> on August 30, 1947 when the campus housed refugees from <a>Camiguin</a>, and even sponsored a boxing bout in its gym to raise funds for the victims.</p>
<h3>University Status</h3>
<p>In a bid for university status, Fr.
Francisco Z.
Araneta, S.J., then rector, had vowed to St. Francis Xavier that if ever Ateneo de Cagayan is conferred as a university before its Commencement Exercises on <a>March 22</a> <a>1958</a>, he will rename the university after the saint.</p>
<p>On said date, an hour before the Commencement Exercises, then Secretary of Education Manuel Lim, had sent a telegram stating that Ateneo de Cagayan has now been granted university status.</p>
<p>On <a>August 27</a> <a>1958</a>, Ateneo de Cagayan was inaugurated as a university and had officially become Xavier University.
It became the first university in Mindanao, and the first Jesuit institution, among those existing in the Philippines, even first before its mother school Ateneo de Manila University to be given university status.
After the inauguration, a banquet was held in honor of then <a>Philippine President</a> <a>Carlos P. Garcia</a>, who was conferred, the very same day, the honorary degree Doctor of Laws, the first honorary degree given by the university.</p>
<h3>Xavier University today</h3>
<p>Today, X.U. has four campuses, A Grade School in Macasandig (about 2,000 students), High School in Pueblo and Grade School Annex (Nursery to Grade 6, also about 2,000 students), Manresa Complex that houses the College of Agriculture laboratory classes, extension programs and <a>SEARSOLIN</a>, and the Main Campus in Corrales Avenue - where X.U. has about 11,000 college, professional schools and technology students being trained.</p>
