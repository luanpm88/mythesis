<p><strong>Seton Hill University</strong> is a small <a>Catholic</a> <a>liberal arts</a> <a>university</a> of about 2100 students in <a>Greensburg</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, near <a>Pittsburgh</a>.
Formerly a <a>women's college</a>, it became a <a>coeducational</a> university in 2002.</p>
<p>The school was founded in 1885 by the <a>Sisters of Charity</a>.
It is named for <a>Elizabeth Ann Seton</a> (1774&#x2013;1821), who founded the Sisters of Charity and who, after her death, was canonized as the United States' first native-born saint.
(<a>Seton Hall University</a> and the <a>College of Saint Elizabeth</a> in New Jersey are also named after Elizabeth Ann Seton.)

<p>In 1914, Seton Hill Junior college was opened by the Sisters of Charity.
With the approval of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Seton Hill College was created four years later.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, men were regularly admitted to many programs at Seton Hill College, including music and theater.
In 2002, Seton Hill was officially granted university status by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
After president JoAnne Boyle formalized the school's new status as a university, the teams' nickname was changed from &quot;Spirits&quot; to &quot;Griffins,&quot; and several men's athletics teams were added, including <a>American football</a>.
In 2006, Seton Hill announced it was transferring to NCAA Division II and joining the <a>West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (WVIAC).
They had belonged to the <a>NAIA</a>.</p>
<p>Seton Hill University received public attention in 2010 after announcing that it would be providing an <a>iPad</a> to all full-time students, as part of a technology plan that also provides a 13&quot; <a>MacBook</a> to all incoming freshmen, and provides juniors with a new model that they can take with them when they graduate.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p>Active clubs representing the diverse political views of the student body include the College Republicans, the University Democrats, the Gay-Straight Alliance, and the Respect Life Club.
In 2003, the school conferred an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon <a>Steve Forbes</a>, president and CEO of Forbes, Inc.
In 2006, the convocation speaker was U.S. Representative <a>John Murtha</a> (D-Pa).</p>
<p>Seton Hill has a student-to-faculty ratio of 15:1.
The typical class size for courses in the major is about 20-25.
Liberal arts core classes tend to be larger, at 30-45 students.</p>
<p>Recent changes on campus include the addition of a branch of <a>Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> (LECOM), and two arts facilities in downtown Greensburg: an art studio and a new performing arts building (devoted to music, theater, and dance).

<h3>Women's sports</h3>
<p>The Department of Athletics sponsors women's intercollegiate softball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, equestrian, lacrosse, soccer, volleyball, golf, and tennis.</p>
<h3>Men's sports</h3>
<p>In 2005, 60% of the entering class was male, due to an influx of male students who were interested in new sports programs such as football.
In 2008, the football team had a 10-3 record.
The football team and the men's soccer team each won the inaugural West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's team sportsmanship award in 2008.</p>
<p>2006 led to a berth to the NAIA World Series for Baseball in the program's third year of existence.
