<p>Anna University was formed on September 4, 1978, as a unitary type of university.
It integrated four technical institutions in the city of <a>Chennai</a> (previously known as <em>Madras</em>), including the <a>College of Engineering, Guindy</a>, established in 1794, and <a>Madras Institute of Technology</a>, established in 1949, which offered the first engineering degrees in India.
</p>
<p>Perarignar Anna University of Technology (PAUT) was the original name used in 1978.
In 1982 the current name of Anna University was adopted, removing the words &quot;Perarignar&quot; and &quot;Technology&quot;.
In December 2001, it was converted into an <a>affiliating university</a>, with almost all engineering colleges in the state of <a>Tamil Nadu</a> under its fold and also absorbing all the six government engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu as its constituent colleges.
In all, it brought together about 250 engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu.</p>
