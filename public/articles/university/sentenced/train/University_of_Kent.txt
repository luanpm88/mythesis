<p>The <strong>University of Kent</strong>, previously the <strong>University of Kent at Canterbury</strong>, is a <a>campus</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Kent</a>, <a>England</a> established in 1965.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A university in the ancient city of <a>Canterbury</a> was first considered in 1947, when an anticipated growth in student numbers led several localities to seek the creation of a new university, including Kent.
However, the plans came to nothing.</p>
<p>A decade later both population growth and greater demand for university places led to new considerations.
In 1959 Kent County Council explored the possibilities of a university through its Education Committee, Two months later the Education Committee agreed to seek a site at or near Canterbury, given the historical associations of the city, subject to the support of Canterbury City Council.
By 1962 a site was found at Beverley Farm, straddling the then boundary between the City of Canterbury and the <a>administrative county</a> of Kent.
The University was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> on 4 January 1965 and the first students arrived in the October of that year.
On 30 March 1966 <a>Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent</a> was formally installed as the first <a>Chancellor</a>.</p>
<p>The university's original name, chosen in 1962, was the <strong>University of Kent at Canterbury</strong>, reflecting the fact that the campus straddled the boundary between the <a>county borough</a> of <a>Canterbury</a> and <a>Kent County Council</a>.
At the time it was the normal practice for universities to be named after the town or city whose boundaries they were in, with both &quot;University of Kent&quot; and &quot;University of Canterbury&quot; initially proposed.
The name adopted reflected the support of both the city and county authorities, as well as the existence of the <a>University of Canterbury</a> in <a>New Zealand</a>, which officially opposed the use of a name too similar to its own.
The abbreviation <strong>UKC</strong> became a popular abbreviation for the university.
Part of the original reasoning for the name disappeared when <a>local government reforms in the 1970s</a> resulted in the Canterbury campus falling entirely within the <a>City of Canterbury</a>, which no longer has county borough status, and Kent County Council.</p>
<p>The University of Kent at Canterbury was envisaged as being a <a>collegiate</a> establishment, with most students living in one of the colleges on campus, and as specialising in <a>inter-disciplinary</a> studies in all fields.
Over the years, changing demands have largely destroyed this original concept, leading to the present state, which is nearer the norm for a British University.
However, the four original colleges - Darwin, Eliot, Keynes and Rutherford - remain, each with their own Master, and new college, Woolf, opened in 2008.

This is one of several new buildings constructed in recent years.</a></p>
<p>The university grew at a rapid rate throughout the 1960s, with three colleges and many other buildings on campus being completed by the end of the decade.
The 1970s saw further construction, but the university also encountered the biggest physical problem in its history.
The university had been built above a tunnel on the disused <a>Canterbury and Whitstable Railway</a>.
In July 1974 the tunnel collapsed, damaging part of the Cornwallis Building, which sank nearly a metre within about an hour on the evening of 11 July.
Fortunately, the university had insurance against subsidence, so it was able to pay for the south-west corner of the building to be demolished and replaced by a new wing at the other end of the building.</p>
<p>In 1982 the university opened the University Centre at Tonbridge (now the University of Kent at Tonbridge) for its School of <a>Continuing Education</a>, helping to enhance the availability of teaching across the county.</p>
<p>During the 1990s and 2000s the University expanded beyond its original campus.
It now has campuses in <a>Medway</a>, <a>Tonbridge</a> and <a>Brussels</a>, and works in partnership with <a>Canterbury College</a>, <a>West Kent College</a>, <a>South Kent College</a> and <a>MidKent College</a>.
In 2003 the title was changed to <strong>University of Kent</strong>.
<em>University of Kent at Canterbury</em> and <em>UKC</em> are still used to refer to the Canterbury site, with other variants such as <em>University of Kent at Medway</em> and <em>University of Kent at Brussels</em> in use for the other sites.
The term <em>UKC</em> is also still heavily used by both students and alumni for the University as a whole.</p>
<p>In the 2000s the university entered a collaboration named <a>Universities at Medway</a> with the <a>University of Greenwich</a>, <a>Mid Kent College</a> and <a>Canterbury Christ Church University</a> to deliver university provision in the <a>Medway</a> area.
This led to the development of the <em>University of Kent at Medway</em>, opened from 2001.
Initially based at Mid-Kent College, a new joint campus opened in 2004.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Canterbury</h3>
<p>The main <a>Canterbury</a> <a>campus</a> covers &lt;!--CheckT--&gt; and is in an elevated position just over two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the city centre.
It currently has approximately 12,000 full-time and 6,200 part-time students and some 600 academic and research staff.

<h4>Colleges</h4>
<p>The university is now divided into five colleges, named after distinguished scholars.
In chronological order of construction:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Eliot</a> (the <a>poet</a> <a>T.
S. Eliot</a>) (1965)</li>
  <li><a>Woolf</a> (the <a>writer</a> <a>Virginia Woolf</a>) (2008)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the 5 main colleges, the following 2 associate colleges:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Chaucer</a></li>
  <li><a>Wye</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[[File:UNIVERSITY OF KENT WOOLF COLLEGE.JPG|thumb|Student accommodation at [[Woolf College, Kent]]]]</p>
<p>There was much discussion about the names adopted for most of the colleges with the following alternative names all in consideration at one point or another:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Eliot: Caxton, after <a>William Caxton</a></li>
  <li>For Keynes: <a>Richborough</a>, a town in Kent; <a>Anselm</a>, a former <a>Archbishop of Canterbury</a></li>
  <li>For Darwin: Anselm (again); Attlee, after <a>Clement Attlee</a>, the post war Prime Minister; Becket, after <a>Thomas Becket</a>, another former Archbishop (this was the recommendation of the college's provisional committee but rejected by the Senate); Conrad; Elgar, after <a>Edward Elgar</a>; Maitland; Marlowe, after <a>Christopher Marlowe</a>; Russell, after <a>Bertrand Russell</a> (this was the recommendation of the Senate but rejected by the Council); Tyler, after both <a>Wat Tyler</a> and Tyler Hill on which the campus stands.
The name for the College proved especially contentious and was eventually decided by a postal ballot of members of the Senate, choosing from: Attlee, Conrad, Darwin, Elgar, Maitland, Marlowe and Tyler.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Both Becket and Tyler were eventually used as the names for residential buildings on campuses and the building housing both the Architecture and Anthropology departments is named Marlowe.)</p>
<p>Each college has residential rooms, <a>lecture</a> theatres, study rooms, <a>computer</a> rooms and social areas.
The intention of the <em>colleges</em> was that they should not be just <a>Halls of Residence</a>, but complete <em>academic</em> communities.
Each college has its own <a>bar</a>, all rebuilt on a larger scale, and originally its own dining hall (only Rutherford has a functioning dining hall; Darwin's is hired out for conferences and events; Keynes's was closed in 2000 and converted into academic space; and Eliot's was closed in 2006).
It was expected that each college (more were planned) would have around 600 students as members, with an equivalent proportion of staff, with half the students living within the college itself and the rest coming onto campus to eat and study within their colleges.
Many facilities, ranging from accommodation, tutorials and alumni relations, would be handled on a college basis.
With no planned academic divisions below the Faculty level, the colleges would be main focus of students' lives and there would be no units of a similar or smaller size to provide a rival focus of loyalties.
<a>thumb|left|The centre of parkwood, with houses to the right and the flats in the centre</a> This vision of a collegiate university has increasingly fallen away.
The funding for colleges did not keep pace with the growth in student numbers, with the result that only four colleges were built.
In later years when there was heavy student demand for scarce accommodation in Canterbury the solution was found in building additional on-campus accommodation but not in the form of further colleges.
The hopes that students living off campus would stay around to eat dinner in their colleges were not met, whilst the abolition of college amenities fees removed students' direct stake in their colleges.
With the growth of specialist subject departments as well as of other university wide facilities, more and more of the role of colleges was transferred to the central university.
Accommodation and catering were transferred to the centralised <em>University of Kent at Canterbury Hospitality</em> (UKCH).</p>
<p>Today the University cannot be considered <a>collegiate</a> in any true sense - applications are made to the University as a whole, and many of the colleges rely on each other for day-to-day operation.
Academic departments have no formal ties to colleges other than those that are located within particular college buildings due to availability of space, with lectures, seminars and tutorials taking place wherever there is an available room rather than on a college basis.
Many students are allocated accommodation in their respective college, but some are housed in developments with no defined collegiate link whilst others are housed in different colleges.
In addition to these college accommodations there are also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Darwin Houses, a set of 26 student houses next to Darwin College, opened in 1989</li>
  <li>Becket Court, next to Eliot College, opened in 1990</li>
  <li>Tyler Court, three blocks of halls of residence.
Block A was opened in 1995 for <a>undergraduates</a>.</li>
<li>Parkwood, a mini student <a>village</a> comprising 262 two-storey houses and a recently built apartment complex, about 10&nbsp;minutes walk from the main campus.
The initial houses were opened in 1980.
was opened in 2008.
The new college accommodates only postgraduate and mature students.</p>
<h4>Library</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Templeman Library, which sits at the heart of the Canterbury Campus.
The upper floors offer impressive views of the city of Canterbury.</a>
The Templeman <a>Library</a> (named after Dr Geoffrey Templeman, the University's first Vice-Chancellor) contains over a million items in stock including <a>book</a>s, journals, <a>video</a>s, <a>DVD</a>s, and archive materials (for example, a full text of <em><a>The Times</a></em> from 1785 onwards), yet it is still only half its planned size.
It has a materials fund of approximately &#x00a3;1million a year, and adds 12,000 items every year.
It is open every day in term time.
It receives 800,000 visits a year, with approximately half a million loans per annum.</p>
<p>It also houses the British Cartoon Archive, (established 1975</p>
<p>Additionally, a &#x00a3;1.5 million sports facility called the Sport Centre was completed in 2003.
Its facilities include <a>tennis</a> and <a>squash</a> courts, <a>hockey</a> and <a>football</a> pitches, a state of the art <a>gym</a>nasium, a cardio theatre, a dance studio, a multi purpose sports hall and a <a>fair trade</a> cafe, but no swimming pool.</p>
<p>There are Seven dining areas on campus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Woody's (Pub Classics)</li>
  <li>Dolce Vita (Fusion)</li>
  <li>Mungo's (Burgers, Salads &amp; Waffles)</li>
  <li>Rutherford Bar (Tapas &amp; Mediterranean)</li>
  <li>Gulbenkian Cafe (Lunch &amp; Theatre menu)</li>
  <li>Origin's Bar &amp; Bistro (Tex-Mex)</li>
  <li>The Beagle (Local Specialities)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these main eating outlets there are many vending machines and some bars.</p>

<h3>Medway</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2000 the University joined with other educational institutes to form the &quot;Universities for Medway&quot; initiative, aimed at increasing participation in <a>higher education</a> in the <a>Medway Towns</a>.</p>
<p>However the interdisciplinary approach proved increasingly complex for two reasons.
The levels of specialisation at <a>A Levels</a> meant that many students had not studied particular subjects for some years and this made it impossible to devise a course that both covered areas unstudied by some and did not bore others.
This proved an especial problem in Natural Sciences, where many Mathematics students had not studied Chemistry at A Level and vice versa.
<a>thumb|left|Kent Business School</a> Additionally many subjects, particularly those in the Social Sciences, were not taught at A Level and required the first year as a grounding in the subject rather than an introduction to several different new subjects.
Problems were especially encountered in the Faculty of Natural Sciences where the differing demands of Mathematics and physical sciences led to two almost completely separate programmes and student bases.</p>
<p>The Coat of Arms is now formally used only for degree certificates, degree programmes and some merchandise, as a result of the University seeking a consistent identity branding.</p>
<p>In the world university league tables, Kent is placed in the top 500 world Universities (441st in the world) by the 2007 Quacquerrelli-Symonds/Times Higher Education Supplement (QS-THES) league table.</p>
<p><em><a>The Guardian</a><strong>s analysis of the <a>National Student Survey</a> in 2007 placed Kent in 18th place nationally for student satisfaction.</strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Top 20 Subjects &amp; Recent Performance</h3>
<p>According to <a>The Guardian</a> University of Kent is ranked 9th in the UK for Business and Economics, 12th for Architecture, 14th for Modern Languages.
In addition, The Complete University Guide - in association with <a>The Independent</a> found that Kent ranked 19th for Accounting and Finance, and also 19th for Psychology</p>
<h3>Franco-British programme</h3>
<p>The bilingual Franco-British double-degree programme combines subjects in one degree and is taught in two countries.
The first year is spent at the University of Kent, the second year at the <a>Institut d'&#x00e9;tudes politiques de Lille</a> (IEP), the third year at the University of Kent, the fourth year at the IEP of Lille and the fifth is spent in Canterbury, Brussels or Lille.</p>
<p>The students of the Franco-British double-degree programme receive, at the end of the fourth year, the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> (BA) degree from the University of Kent, the Dipl&#x00f4;me by the IEP of Lille and, at the end of the fifth year, either the <a>Master of Arts</a> (MA) degree in Canterbury or in Brussels or the Master delivered by the IEP of Lille, chosen between <em>14 parcours de formation</em> by the IEP of Lille.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p> In the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> the University of Kent was placed 24th out of 118 participating institutions in terms of the best, or 4*, research (according to the RAE league tables in <em><a>The Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em>).</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The student population is quite mixed, with approximately 16% of students coming from overseas.
No fewer than 128 different nationalities are currently represented.
The female to male ratio is 55 women to every 45 men.
(launched in January 2008).
The newspaper is published every two weeks and is edited by a group of student volunteers.
While the newspaper and website are funded by the Students' Union, they are independent in content.</p>
<h3>Chaplaincy</h3>
<p>Whilst the University is <a>secular</a>, there is a strong <a>chaplain</a>cy consisting of permanent <a>Anglican</a> and <a>Catholic</a> <a>priest</a>s and a <a>Pentecostal</a> <a>minister</a>, as well as part-time chaplains from other denominations and faiths.</p>
