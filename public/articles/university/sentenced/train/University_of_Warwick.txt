<p>The <strong>University of Warwick</strong> (informally <strong>Warwick University</strong>, or simply <strong>Warwick</strong>) is a public research university located in <a>Coventry</a>, United Kingdom.
It was established in 1965 as part of a government initiative to expand access to higher education, and in 2000 <a>Warwick Medical School</a> was opened as part of an initiative to train more doctors in Britain.
The University describes itself as a research led institution and in the last <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> the University was the 7th highest-ranked research institution in the UK.</p>
<p>The University's <a>coat of arms</a> includes atoms of two <a>isotope</a>s of <a>lithium</a>, a <a>DNA</a> helix to represent science and also the Bear and Ragged Staff of <a>Warwickshire</a> and the Elephant and Castle of <a>Coventry</a>.
The bear is not chained in the current depiction of the University's coat of arms, although it was in earlier versions and in the <a>letters patent</a> issued by the <a>College of Arms</a>.</p>
<p>Warwick is a member of <a>AACSB</a>, the <a>Association of MBAs</a>, <a>EQUIS</a>, the <a>Russell Group</a>, <a>Universities UK</a>, <a>European University Association</a>, and <a>Association of Commonwealth Universities</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Establishment</h3>
<p><a>upright|right|thumb|Warwick banner on University Road</a></p>
<p>The idea for a university in Coventry was proposed shortly after the conclusion of the <a>Second World War</a> but it was a bold and imaginative partnership of the City and the County which brought the University into being on a  site jointly granted by the two authorities.
There was some discussion between local sponsors from both the city and county over whether it should be named after Coventry or Warwickshire.
The establishment of the University of Warwick was given approval by the government in 1961 and received its <a>Royal Charter</a> of Incorporation in 1965.
Since then, the University has incorporated the former <a>Coventry College of Education</a> in 1979 and has extended its land holdings by the purchase of adjoining farm land.
The University also benefited from a substantial donation from the family of <a>Jack Martin</a>, which enabled the construction of the <a>Warwick Arts Centre</a>.</p>
<p>The campus originally consisted of distinctive Modern (1960s) architecture, in deliberate contrast with the medieval, classical, or &quot;red brick&quot; character of older Universities.
The freedom given to academic departments combined with an aggressive and unapologetic commercial approach, both policies of the first Vice-Chancellor Lord Butterworth, were new innovations for UK Higher Education and have subsequently been copied by many other Universities.</p>
<p>The University is situated on a large 2.8&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; campus which straddles the boundary between the City of <a>Coventry</a> and the County of <a>Warwickshire</a>.
The Central Campus contains all of the main student amenities, all but four of the student halls, and the Students' Union.
It also has Barclays Bank, Natwest Bank, Santander Bank, a Costcutter shop, a laundrette, a health centre, and a pharmacy.</p>
<h3>Rapid growth</h3>
<p>The University initially admitted a small intake of graduate students in 1964 and took its first 450 undergraduates in October 1965.
The student population is now 21,598(as of April 2008), with around a third being postgraduates.
25% of the student body comes from overseas and over 114 countries are represented on the campus.
The University has 29 academic departments and over 40 research centres and institutes, in four Faculties: Arts, Medicine, Science and Social Sciences.
There are 1,607 academic staff, 844 research staff, and 5,168 total staff (as of April 2008).
More recently, the University was seen as a favoured institution of the British <a>New Labour</a> government.
It was academic partner for a number of flagship Government schemes including the [[National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth]] and the [[NHS University]] (now defunct).
[[Tony Blair]] described Warwick as &quot;a beacon among British universities for its dynamism, quality and entrepreneurial zeal&quot;.</pre>
<p>Warwick was one of the first UK universities to develop close links with the business community, and has been successful in the commercialisation of research.
This commercial approach has resulted in its being nicknamed &quot;Warwick University Limited&quot; (or, more recently, &quot;Warwick University <a>PLC</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>[[File:Clinton_warwick.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bill Clinton]]]]</p>
<p>On the recommendation of <a>Tony Blair</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a> chose Warwick as the venue for his last major foreign policy address as <a>US President</a> in December 2000.
<a>Sandy Berger</a>, Clinton&#x2019;s <a>National Security Advisor</a>, explaining the decision in his Press Briefing on 7 December 2000, said that: &quot;Warwick is one of Britain's newest and finest research universities, singled out by Prime Minister Blair as a model both of academic excellence and independence from the government.&quot;</p>
<p>In his speech Clinton covered a number of issues, including Third World debt relief, fighting infectious diseases such as <a>AIDS</a>, basic education rights, and the &quot;digital divide&quot;, which he summarized as the new development agenda for the 21st century.
Clinton was accompanied by his wife <a>Hillary Clinton</a> and daughter <a>Chelsea Clinton</a>.
During his visit, he planted a Pin Oak (<em>Quercus palustris</em>) sapling outside Senate House, the (then) university administration block.</p>
<p>The University of Warwick was the location for an important agreement between the Labour Party and the Trade Unions on Labour policy and trade union law, struck in July 2004.
Subsequently the agreement has become popularly referred to as the <a>Warwick Agreement</a>.
According to <a>The Guardian</a>, &quot;it made peace between discontented elements in the unions and the government.
It thereby averted the threat of mass disaffiliation from the party by the unions and helped to secure union support for Labour in the 2005 election.&quot;</p>
<p>Warwick is one of the few universities to reach its target for the proportion of state students admitted (86%).
This may be due to the University's distinctive community policy and commitment to increasing access to higher education.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|thumb|Map of The University of Warwick</a> --&gt; [[File:Warwick Campus River.jpg|right|thumb|Lake at the rear of [[Warwick Business School]]]] The University of Warwick is located on the outskirts of <a>Coventry</a>, &lt;!--CheckT--&gt; southwest of the city centre, and not in <a>Warwick</a> as its name suggests.
The University comprises three contiguous campuses, all in walking distance &lt;!-- debatable:P --&gt; of the others:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Main Campus</li>
  <li>The <a>Gibbet Hill Campus</a> &#x2014; home to Life Sciences and <a>Warwick Medical School</a></li>
  <li>The <a>Westwood Campus</a> &#x2014; home to the Institute of Education, Arden House conference centre, an indoor tennis centre, a running track, some postgraduate facilities and residences</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, other University properties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>University of Warwick Science Park</li>
  <li>Clinical Sciences Building at <a>University Hospital Coventry</a> &#x2014; part of the Warwick Medical School</li>
  <li>Warwick Horticulture Research International (HRI) Research &amp; Conference Centre, Wellesbourne, Warwickshire</li>
</ul>
<h2>Academic standards</h2>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>The University was ranked seventh for quality of research out of 159 of the institutions which took part in the <a>UK Funding Councils</a>' 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a>.
Over 65% of the University's academic staff are located in &quot;world-leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot; departments with top research ratings of 4* or 3*.
Warwick students also average top A-Level grades (often equivalent to more than A*AAa at A-level).</p>
<p>Top University in the Midlands for ten years (The Sunday Times University Guide 2007) Aim to be within the top 50 in the world by 2015 (the University's 50th Anniversary)</p>
<p>The results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) reiterate Warwick&#x2019;s position as one of the UK&#x2019;s leading research universities, with Warwick ranked at 7th overall in the UK (based on multi-faculty institutions).
65% of Warwick's research is 'world-leading' or 'internationally excellent' (Quality level of either 3* or 4*) </p>
<p>In the World MBA rankings published by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em>, Warwick ranked 42nd in the world for its Full-time MBA and 35th for its Executive MBA.</em>
The <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, <a>ARWU</a> released in 2010, placed the University of Warwick 34th worldwide for the subject of economics/business, ahead of <a>Dartmouth College</a>, <a>INSEAD</a>, <a>London Business School</a>, <a>Vanderbilt University</a>, and <a>University of Southern California</a>, and 39th worldwide in the field of mathematics shared the position with <a>California Institute of Technology</a> and ahead of <a>Carnegie Mellon University</a> and <a>Imperial College London</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008 the Sunday Times released averages of all its tables over 10 years, ranking Warwick as 4th in the country from 1998&#x2013;2007.
In 2000 the Sutton Trust also named Warwick as one of the leading universities in the UK, placing it 4th overall.</p>
<p>Internationally, Warwick is ranked very inconsistently by major global university rankings providers.
While it was placed 53rd overall by <a>QS World University Rankings</a> and 151&#x2013;200th by <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, it was not included among top 200 universities by recent <a>Times Higher World University Rankings</a>.
The university claims the inconsistency is due to its relative youth in comparison to other universities.

<h2>Future development</h2>
<h3>Vision 2020</h3>
<p>&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|thumb|The proposed campus of Warwick 2020</a> --&gt; [[File:Warwick university buildings panoramic - Manufacturing and CS and Maths.jpg|thumb|300px|Recently
constructed buildings on the Warwick campus; (left to right) the International Manufacturing Centre (IMC), the Department of Computer Science (DCS), and the [[Erik Christopher Zeeman|Zeeman]] building (Maths and Statistics).]]</p>
<p>In November 2005, the University of Warwick made public its vision for the year 2020 and outlined proposals for how it would like to develop its campus over the next 15 years.
These proposals built upon recent construction activity which included a new Mathematics and Statistics Building, a new Computer Science Building, new Business School buildings, the new Heronbank Residences and an expanded Sports Centre.
The proposals would see a shift in the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; on campus away from the Students' Union towards the new University House and a proposed &quot;Academic Square&quot;, located around the new Maths and Computer Science buildings.</p>
<h3>University House</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|University House, the main administration building</a></p>
<p>In 2003 the University acquired the former Headquarters of the <a>National Grid</a> which it converted into its new University administration building (now called University House).
The building includes a student learning centre called the &quot;Learning Grid&quot;.</p>
<h3>Singapore Campus</h3>
<p>In 2004 the University publicly revealed that it planned to open a 10,000-student campus in Singapore.
Due to concerns about academic freedom, cost and freedom of speech for students, many students and academic staff opposed the scheme.
Following exhaustive research the matter was discussed by the University's Senate, which requested further research to be undertaken, in effect forcing the University to abandon the scheme.
Attempts to establish some firm links with Singapore (albeit not necessarily a full physical campus) are continuing.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<h3>Student life</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Rootes Social Building</a> Undergraduate student life at Warwick is divided into two phases.
In the first year, student life revolves around campus and, in particular, the Students' Union (with its sports clubs, societies and entertainment facilities).
In subsequent years students live off-campus, many live in <a>Leamington Spa</a>, <a>Kenilworth</a> or either <a>Earlsdon</a> or <a>Canley</a> in <a>Coventry</a>.</p>
<h3>Campus facilities</h3>
<p>Staff, students and visitors benefit from the many non-academic facilities on campus.
As well as <a>Warwick Arts Centre</a> (see below), the University hosts a large leisure centre, comprising 25&nbsp;m swimming pool, two sports halls, gymnasium, squash courts and rock-climbing facility.
Elsewhere on campus are a number of other sports halls, outside tennis courts, 400&nbsp;m athletics track, multi-purpose outdoor surfaces and cricket grounds.
Sports facilities are being constantly expanded, following the commencement of <em>Warwick Sport</em>, a 2005 joint venture between the University and the Students' Union.
Indoor tennis courts have recently been opened on the Westwood Campus sports venue and an Olympic-size swimming pool has been rumoured in the long-term, depending on <a>Coventry</a> City Council's priorities.
Most of the University's sports facilities are open to the general public.</p>
<p>Warwick University Library has recently been remodelled and now houses new services to support Research and Teaching practice and collaboration between departments.
The Wolfson Research Exchange opened earlier this year and provides seminar rooms, conference space and study areas for Postgraduate Research students.
The Teaching Grid, which has just celebrated its first birthday, is a flexible space which allows teaching staff to try out new technologies and techniques.
The Library also runs the Learning Grid based in University House, which is a technology rich space for all members of the University to use and provides access to video conferencing facilities, smart boards, networked PCs and a collection of core text books.
</p>
<p>There is a <a>Costcutter</a> supermarket, pharmacy, three banks (<a>Natwest</a>, <a>Barclays</a> and <a>Santander</a>), hair salon, post office, copy shop, and travel agent <a>STA Travel</a> around campus.
A <a>Tesco</a> is located at the nearby <a>Cannon Park</a> shopping centre, a short walk from the Maths and Stats building or Claycroft halls.</p>
<p>All food and drink outlets are operated by either Warwick Hospitality or the Students' Union.</p>

<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|The students' union building &#x2013; SU North and South</a> <a>right|thumb|The students' union building &#x2013; SU South</a> </p>
<p>The <a>University of Warwick Students' Union</a> is one of the biggest <a>Students' Union</a>s in the UK, currently having over 260 <a>societies</a> and 76 <a>sports</a> clubs.
Sports clubs include everything from basketball to squash.
There are new societies every year, including Jailbreak and more recently the HOMMOUS Society.
It has an annual turnover of approximately &#x00a3;6&nbsp;million, the profit from which is used to provide services to students and to employ its staff and <a>Sabbatical officer</a>s.
The Union is divided into two buildings: Union North (mainly societies and administration) and Union South (entertainment facilities).
Union South contains four club venues, seven bars and a cafe over four floors, with some &quot;full Union (building)&quot; events such as <em>Top Banana</em> and <em>Skool Dayz</em>.
Drinks prices are not considered to be particularly cheap but have recently been reduced for some events.</p>
<p>The Union has also recently hosted such bands as <a>Ash</a>, <a>Sugababes</a>, <a>Amerie</a>, <a>The Kooks</a>, <a>Reel Big Fish</a>, <a>The Departure</a>, <a>The Subways</a>, <a>Idlewild</a>, The Rory Mckenna variety show, <a>Hell is for Heroes</a>, <a>The Automatic</a>, The Dave Wright experience, <a>Boy Kill Boy</a>, <a>Amy Winehouse</a>, <a>The Killers</a>, <a>The Streets</a>, <a>Feeder</a> and <a>Scouting for Girls</a>.</p>
<p>The Union is a member of the <a>National Union of Students</a> (NUS) and <a>National Postgraduate Committee</a> (NPC).</p>
<p>The Union South building underwent a &#x00a3;11 million refurbishment in Spring 2008, which was completed in January 2010.
The new facilities included a club and gig venue, a pub, various food outlets, spaces for societies and a pool room.</p>
<h3>Student events</h3>
<p>Warwick hosts many major student-run events including <a>One World Week</a>, <a>Warwick Economics Summit</a>, <a>People &amp; Planet</a>'s Go Green Week, <a>Warwick International Development Summit</a>, Tedx Warwick, RAG Week and <a>Warwick Student Arts Festival</a>.</p>
<p>The University is also home to the largest student-run Real Ale Festival in Great Britain, which takes place annually, always in the eighth week of second academic term.
The festival is organised and staffed by the Warwick University Real Ale Society.
A charity skydiving weekend, <a>The Great Warwick Jump</a>, was set up by the Skydiving Club in 2008 and is now the largest charity event at the University, raising &#x00a3;20,274.00
for charities worldwide in its first year.
The second year saw a new British record for the most tandem jumps in 24 hours with 137 and a total of &#x00a3;57,374 raised for various charities.</p>
<h3>Campus media</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a>Radio Warwick</a>, also known as RaW, one of the most successful student radio stations in the UK</li>
  <li><a>The Boar</a>, an award-winning newspaper distributed free across campus every second Tuesday</li>
  <li><a>Warwick Student Cinema</a>, the university's student cinema housed in a large lecture theatre on campus, showing films on two 35&nbsp;mm projectors most nights of the week.</li>

<h3>Warwick Conferences and Warwick Accommodation</h3>
<p>Warwick was the first UK University to open its lecture and accommodation facilities to outside organisations, for profit, during the vacations.
Warwick Conferences is now a thriving business, with its profits contributing to the University's financial independence, with dedicated, year-round conference centres, Scarman House, Radcliffe and Arden.
Every year, on average 65,000 conference delegates are catered for, with services ranging from banqueting to access to sport facilities.
Warwick Conferences has been recognised as one of the outstanding conference venues in the region and as such boasts among its collection, several awards including 4 Gold M&amp;IT, Godiva, MIMA and CCE Chefs challenge awards.</p>
<p>Warwick Accommodation provides on-campus accommodation for first-year undergraduates, final-year undergraduates (depending on availability) and postgraduate students.
Off-campus accommodation is also provided and consists of privately owned houses which are University managed upon a commission charge.
The location of such houses is usually within the catchment area of Coventry and Leamington Spa for student convenience.</p>
<p>Many of the 5700 on-campus rooms are used by conference guests outside of term-time.
En suite rooms which include Arthur Vick, Jack Martin and Benefactors residences, as well as the standard single Rootes residence, are usually the primary allocation blocks for conference delegates.</p>
<h3>Warwick Retail</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Criticism</h3>
<p>There has been some criticism that the University has become too commercially-minded at the expense of academic creativity and diversity.
The most famous proponent of this critique was the noted historian <a>E.P. Thompson</a>, who wrote <em>Warwick University Ltd</em> in 1971.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with the appointment of <a>Sir Nicholas Scheele</a> as Chancellor in 2002, the University signalled that it intended to continue and expand its commercial activities.
In an interview for the BBC, Scheele said: &quot;I think in the future, education and industry need to become even more closely linked than they have been historically.
As government funding changes, the replacement could well come through private funding from companies, individuals and grant-giving agencies.&quot;</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>The University of Warwick is governed by three formal bodies: the Court, Council and the Senate.
In addition to these, a Steering Committee provide strategic leadership in between meetings of the formal bodies.
Faculties are overseen by Faculty Boards which report to the Senate.
The Principal Officers of the University have responsibility for day-to-day operations of the University.</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p> In 2008 the University of Warwick has launched a new prize, The <a>Warwick Prize for Writing</a>, worth &#x00a3;50,000.
It is defined as &quot;an international cross-disciplinary award which will be given biennially for an excellent and substantial piece of writing in the English language, in any genre or form, on a theme that will change with every award&quot;.
The inaugural winner of the award was <a>Naomi Klein</a> for her critically acclaimed <em>Shock Doctrine</em>.</p>
<h2>University Challenge champions</h2>
<p>Warwick won BBC television's prestigious <a>University Challenge</a> competition in 2007, beating title holders <a>University of Manchester</a> in the final.</p>
