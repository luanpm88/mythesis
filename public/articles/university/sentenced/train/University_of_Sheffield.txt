<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Sheffield</strong> is a leading research <a>university</a> based in the city of <a>Sheffield</a> in <a>South Yorkshire</a>, England.
It is one of the original <a>'red brick' universities</a> and is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of leading research intensive universities.
It was ranked 40th in the world's top 100 universities by the Global University Ranking Study 2009 and is consistently ranked amongst the top 20 universities in the <a>United Kingdom</a> and <a>Europe</a> according to <a>The Good University Guide</a>.
Furthermore, the university is ranked amongst both the UK's and world's Top 100 universities by the Shanghai Jiao Tong (SJTU) and Times Higher (THE) World University Rankings, and the 2008 <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> found 41 submissions out of 49 of Sheffield's research to contain more than 50% of &quot;world-leading&quot; and &quot;internationally excellent&quot; research, which made Sheffield among the Top Ten in the <a>Russell Group</a>.
The university has produced five <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners so far.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three colleges.
The Sheffield School of Medicine was founded in 1828, followed in 1879 by the opening of Firth College by <a>Mark Firth</a>, a <a>steel</a> manufacturer, to teach <a>arts</a> and <a>science</a> subjects.
Firth College then helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach <a>applied science</a>, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover.
The three institutions merged in 1897 to form the <strong>University College of Sheffield</strong>.
Sheffield is one of the six <a>red brick universities</a>.</p>
<h3>Royal Charter</h3>
<p>It was originally envisaged that the University College would join <a>Manchester</a>, <a>Liverpool</a> and <a>Leeds</a> as the fourth member of the federal <a>Victoria University</a>.
However, the Victoria University began to split up before this could happen and so the University College of Sheffield received its own <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1905 and became the <strong>University of Sheffield</strong>.</p>
<p>From 200 full-time students in 1905, the University grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly.
Many new buildings (including the famous <a>Arts Tower</a>) were built and student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 24,000.
In 1987 the University began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the <a>Northern Consortium</a>; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students.</p>
<p>In 1995, the University took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty.
In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and <a>Sheffield Hallam University</a> - however, the University decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to &quot;costs and operational difficulties&quot;.</p>
<p>Over the years, the University has been home to a number of notable writers and scholars, including the literary critic <a>William Empson</a>, who was head of the Department of English; author <a>Angela Carter</a>; five <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners; and <a>Bernard Crick</a>.</p>

<h3>Branding</h3>
<p>The brand (encompassing the visual identity) is centred on the theme of &quot;discovery&quot;, led by the Latin motto from the coat of arms &quot;Rerum Cognoscere Causas&quot; &#x2013; &quot;to discover the causes of things&quot;.</p>
<p>The visual identity includes two specially-designed fonts, TUOS Blake (sans-serif) and TUOS Stephenson (serif), and a carefully-placed full stop added in the most recent rebranding exercise.</p>
<p>The identity has been applied across print, screen and other areas such as signage, vehicle livery and merchandising.
The project was key to the University's Marketing Department receiving &quot;HEIST Marketing Team of the Year, 2005&quot;.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Sheffield was the <em>Sunday Times</em> University of the Year in 2001 and has consistently appeared as one of their top-20 institutions.
Just three universities nationally have more than Sheffield's 30 top-rated subjects for teaching excellence and only five have a greater number than the 35 subject areas at Sheffield deemed to have conducted world-class research in the most recent ratings.
In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a &#x00a3;3.3m
restoration and refurbishment, the <a>University of Sheffield Union of Students</a> underwent a &#x00a3;5m rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion pound refurbishment of the grade II* listed <a>Arts Tower</a> to extend it's lifespan by 30 years.</p>
<h3>St George's</h3>
<p>To the east lies St George's Campus, named after <a>St George's Church</a> (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence).
The campus is centred on Mappin Street, home to a number of University buildings, including the Faculty of <a>Engineering</a> (partly housed in the <a>Grade II-listed</a> <a>Mappin Building</a>) and the University of Sheffield School of Management and Department of <a>Computer Science</a>.
The University also maintains the <a>Turner Museum of Glass</a> in this area.
The University recently converted the listed old <a>Victorian</a> <a>Jessop Hospital for Women</a> buildings into the new home of the Faculty of Music.
The adjacent Edwardian buildings and a large vacant plot of land opposite <a>St George's Church</a> are awaiting development as and when funding permits.</p>
<h3>West of the main campus</h3>
<p>Further west lies Weston Park, the <a>Weston Park Museum</a>, the <a>Harold Cantor Gallery</a>, <a>sports facilities</a> in the <a>Crookesmoor</a> area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the <a>Royal Hallamshire Hospital</a> (although these subjects are taught in the city's extensive <a>teaching hospital</a>s under the <a>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</a>, and throughout <a>South Yorkshire</a> and <a>North East Lincolnshire</a>).
It is in this area that the new &#x00a3;12m <a>Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience</a> (SITraN), opened by Her Majesty <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> in November 2010, is located.</p>
<h3>Student accommodation</h3>
<p> Further west still lie the University <a>halls of residence</a>.
These comprise Tapton Hall of Residence (now vacant awaiting redevelopment into private housing), The Endcliffe Student Village comprising the established Halifax and Stephenson Halls(although much of the Halifax Hall has been converted to conferencing rooms,) Endcliffe Vale Flats, Crescent Flats, Crewe Flats, and newly built (2007) Burbage, Stanage, Howden, Froggatt, Millstone, Rivelin, Yarncliffe, Birchen, Curbar, Cratcliffe, Lawrencefield and Derwent, as well as University owned private houses.
A new student village was completed (but not fully occupied) for the 2009/10 academic year comprising of 1200 beds on the site of the former Ranmoor Halls of Residence, now known as the Ranmoor Village.
Accommodation in both the Endcliffe and Ranmoor villages is rented out during the summer recess to visiting conference delegations etc.</p>
<h3>Manvers campus</h3>
<p>The <a>Manvers</a> campus, at <a>Wath-on-Dearne</a> between <a>Rotherham</a> and <a>Barnsley</a>, is where the majority of nursing is taught.</p>
<h2>Research and teaching quality</h2>
<p>The University of Sheffield has been described by <em><a>The Times</a></em> as one of the powerhouses of British higher education.
A separate ranking, published in the US by Newsweek magazine, and released in August 2006, ranked Sheffield 9th in the UK, 18th in Europe and 70th in the world in a list of the Global Top 100 Universities.</p>
<p>The University has won <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a>s in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2007.
It was also named the <a>Sunday Times University of the Year</a> in 2001.</p>
<p>In the 2007 <a>National Student Survey</a>, five of the University of Sheffield's departments reached the top of the table for overall student satisfaction among the UK universities.
&quot;Dentistry, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Philosophy, East Asian Studies and courses in Modern Languages and Modern Languages with Interpreting returned the highest satisfaction scores in the UK&quot;.</p>
<p>Major research partners and clients include <a>Boeing</a>, <a>Rolls Royce</a>, <a>Unilever</a>, <a>Boots</a>, <a>AstraZeneca</a>, <a>GSK</a>, <a>ICI</a>, and <a>Slazenger</a>, as well as UK and overseas government agencies and charitable foundations.
As an example, the Department of Architecture, under the guidance of Professor Jeremy Till, are currently involved in a research project with development and disaster relief charity <a>Article 25</a> to investigate the possibilities of building sustainably in arid regions.</p>
<p>For many years the University has been engaged in theological publishing through <a>Sheffield Academic Press</a> and <a>JSOT</a> Press.</p>
<p>The University of Sheffield is also a partner organisation in <a>Higher Futures</a>, a collaborative association of institutions set up under the government's <a>Lifelong Learning Networks</a> initiative, to co-ordinate vocational and work-based education.</p>
<p>As well as the research carried out in departments, the university has 84 specialized research centres or institutes.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>The University of Sheffield's 25,000 students arrive mostly from the UK, but include more than 3,700 international students from 120 different countries.
The University employs nearly 6,000 people, including almost 1,400 academic staff.</p>
<h2>Students' Union, sports and traditions</h2>
<p> The University of Sheffield Union of Students was founded in 1906.
It has two bars (<em>Bar One</em> &#x2013; which has a book-able function room with its own bar, <em>The Raynor Lounge</em> &#x2013; and <em>The Interval</em>); three club venues (<em>Fusion</em>, <em>Foundry</em> and <em>Octagon</em>); one off-campus public house (<em>The Fox and Duck</em> in Broomhill); and coffee shops, restaurants, shops, a supermarket, the cinema <a>Film Unit</a>, a fully functioning and student run theatre company (<a>suTCo</a>), a <a>student radio</a> station called <a>Forge Radio</a>, its own newspaper, <em><a>The Forge Press</a></em>, and about two hundred student societies and many sports teams.</p>
<p>The Union hosts a variety of advice and support services.
Real-time information can be found by following @SSiDSheffield or @sheffieldunion on <a>Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>In November 2009 a development project began to redevelop the Students' Union building, funded by &#x00a3;5m by the HEFCE, which was completed and re-opened in September 2010.
Works centred on improving circulation around the building by aligning previously disjointed floors, improving internal access between the Union building and neighbouring University House, and constructing a striking new entrance and lobby that incorporates the university's traditional colours of black and gold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The annual &quot;Varsity Challenge&quot; takes place between teams from the University and its rival <a>Sheffield Hallam University</a> in over 30 events.</p>
<p>As well as <a>rag week</a>, University of Sheffield students used to raise funds by taking part in the Pyjama Jump <a>pub crawl</a>, cross-dressed only in nightwear in mid-winter: the men often dressed in nighties or in drag featuring mini-skirts and fishnet tights, and the women in pyjamas.
This event was banned in 1997 following the hospitalisation of several students.
Another rag tradition is Spiderwalk, a fifty mile trek through the city and the <a>Peak District</a>, the first half through the night, other societies run  fund-raising activities through the night while the walk is on such as a 24-hour role-playing event.
Sheffield's students are also very active when it comes to volunteering for good causes.
The Union's &quot;SheffieldVolunteering&quot; scheme is one of the countries most active and well-recognised student volunteering schemes and has won various national acclaims over the years.</p>
