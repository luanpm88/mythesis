<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:Old Main WSU - Detroit Michigan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Old
Main (Wayne State University)|Old Main]], one of the most historically important buildings on the Wayne State University campus.]]
The first component of the modern Wayne State University was established in 1868 as the Detroit Medical College, now the School of Medicine.
In 1881, the Detroit Normal Training School was established, now the College of Education.
Old Main Hall was built in 1896 as Central High School, which later began adding college classes in 1913.
Those classes evolved into the Detroit Junior College in 1917, the College of the City of Detroit in 1923, and now WSU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
</p>
<p>In 1919, <a>David L. Mackenzie</a> - who served a dual role as Principal of Detroit Central High School and Detroit Junior College - was officially appointed first <a>Dean</a> of the college that he had originated in 1917.
With Mackenzie at the helm, Detroit Junior College grew to become the third largest institution of higher learning in <a>Michigan</a>.
The college was granted four-year degree status in 1923 - becoming the College of the City of Detroit; David L. Mackenzie continued as Dean until his death in 1926.
</p>
<p>In 1920, the Merrill-Palmer Institute for child development was founded.
It is presently known as the Merrill-Palmer Skillman Institute.</p>
<p>In 1927, the <a>Detroit Board of Education</a> dedicated its newest high school to the memory of David L. Mackenzie.
The three-story structure still stands on the city's west side at 9275 Wyoming Avenue; <a>Mackenzie High School</a> closed its doors for the last time in June, 2007.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Detroit Board of Education organized the six colleges it ran- liberal arts, medical, education, pharmacy, engineering and a graduate school- into one university.
In January 1934, that institution was officially named Wayne University.
<a>thumb|250px|College of Education.</a>
Wayne University continued to grow, adding the School of Social Work in 1935, the <a>Law School</a> in 1927, and the School of Business Administration in 1946.
Wayne University was renamed Wayne State University in 1956, and the institution became a constitutionally established university by popularly adopted amendment to the Michigan Constitution in 1959.</p>
<p>As Wayne State University, the institution grew with the additions of the College of Lifelong Learning in 1973, the School of Fine and Performing Arts and the College of Urban, Labor and Metropolitan Affairs in 1985.</p>
<p>The University Libraries have grown to include six libraries, the School of Library and Information Science and the Office for University General Education.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, WSU has been aggressive in constructing new green glass buildings, including a new Welcome Center, which was controversial because of its cost and the displacement of several local businesses.
Several new residence halls have been built, to further university officials' goal of moving the college away from a commuter school.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: <a>right|thumb|The Warriors athletic logo.</a>
--&gt; The school's intercollegiate athletic program was established in 1917 by director of athletics David L. Holmes.
Revered by his athletes, Holmes initially coached all sports.
His track teams were nationally known into the 1950s; in his first ten years, he produced two Olympians from the school's Victorian-era gym.
Although he had major ambitions for Wayne and scheduled such teams as Notre Dame and Penn State in the 1920s, the lack of facilities and money for athletics kept the athletic program small.
</p>
<p>A student poll selected the name of &quot;Tartars&quot; for the school's teams in 1927.
In 1999, the university changed the name to the &quot;Warriors,&quot; due to a feeling that the Tartar name was dated and that not many people knew what a Tartar was.
Wayne State competes in men's baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, swimming and tennis, and women's basketball, cross country, fencing, ice hockey, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball.</p>
<p>WSU participates in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> in the <a>Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (GLIAC) for all sports except ice hockey.</p>
<p>Wayne State's women's ice hockey program competes at the NCAA <a>Division I</a> level in the <a>College Hockey America</a> (CHA) conference.
Wayne State dropped their men's Division 1 hockey program at the end of the 2007-08 season.</p>
