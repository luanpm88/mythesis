<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Royal College of Art was founded in 1837, and was known as the <strong>Government School of Design</strong>.
In 1853, it became the <strong>National Art Training School</strong> with the <strong>Female School of Art</strong> in separate buildings; and, in 1896, it received the name <strong>Royal College of Art</strong>.
During the 19th century, it was often referred to as the <strong>South Kensington Schools</strong>.
See <a>Richard Burchett</a>, an early Headmaster, for more details on this period.
After 130 years in operation, the Royal College of Art was granted its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1967, which gave it the status of an independent university with the power to grant its own degrees.</p>
<p>Its <a>Royal Charter</a> specifies that the objects of the College are &quot;<em>to advance learning, knowledge and professional competence particularly in the field of fine arts, in the principles and practice of art and design in their relation to industrial and commercial processes and social developments and other subjects relating thereto through teaching, research and collaboration with industry and commerce</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The RCA building in <a>Kensington Gore</a> is a Grade II <a>listed building</a> and dates from the 1960s.
It was designed by staff from the RCA.</p>
