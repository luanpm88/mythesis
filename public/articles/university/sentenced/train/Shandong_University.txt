<p></p>
<p><strong>Shandong University</strong> (, colloquially abbreviated as <strong>Shanda</strong>, , English acronym <strong>SDU</strong>) is a public comprehensive university in  <a>Shandong</a>, China.
It is one of the largest  universities in China by student population (57,500 full-time students in 2009) and is supported directly by the national government.
</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Mirroring the changeful history of China in the 20th century, present-day Shandong University is the result of multiple merges as well as occasional splits and restructurings that have involved more than a dozen academic institutions over time.
The oldest of Shandong University's precursor institutions, <a>Cheeloo University</a>, was founded by American and English mission agencies in the late 19th century (as Tengchow College in Penglai).
Shandong University derives its official founding date from the imperial Shandong University () established in Jinan in November 1901 as the second modern national university in the country.
It has been included in major national initiatives seeking to enhance the international  competitiveness of the top-tier universities in China such as <a>Project 985</a>.</p>
<h2>Reputation and Ranking</h2>
<p>In the general university ranking performed by the Chinese University Alumni Association (CUAA), Shandong University ranked number 14 among 100 Chinese universities in 2010.
It reached the 11th highest score in the &quot;teaching&quot; category of this ranking.
For the last 10 years, Shandong University has been continuously ranked among the top 10 universities nationwide in terms of the number of publications included in the Science Citation Index.
The governor of Shandong, Yue Jun (), received 1,000 <a>tael</a>s of silver (approximately 37&nbsp;kg) to establish the academy.
The incident, known as the &quot;Jinan Jiaoan&quot; (), had considerable diplomatic repercussions and it took several years to settle the resulting issues.
The Luoyuan Academy was rebuilt extensively in 1896 to become the largest institution of its kind in Shandong.
The buildings were designed by the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows, and Hamilton from Chicago.

<p>In 1937, when the Japanese occupied northing China during the <a>Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, Cheeloo University evacuated to <a>Sichuan</a> and operated on the campus of West China Union University.
Cheeloo University was dissolved in 1952.
Its Medical School was fused with Shandong Provincial Medical College and the East China Norman Bethune Medical College to form Shandong Medical College (renamed into &quot;Shandong Medical University&quot; in 1985).</p>
<h3>Shandong College (1901)</h3>
<p>[[File:Yuan shikai.jpg|thumb|right|As
governor, [[Yuan Shikai]] (shown as <a>Emperor of China</a> in 1916) drafted the charter for Shandong College.]]
The initiative for the founding of Shandong University (as Imperial Shandong University, ) in 1901 as a national, modern university came from <a>Yuan Shikai</a>, then the governor of Shandong province.
Yuan Shikai was the chief military modernizer of the late Qing Dynasty whose control over a powerful army combined with his personal ambition played a key role in the birth of the <a>Republic of China</a> as well as its descent into warlordism in the early 20th century.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Yuan Shikai had been governor of Shandong Province since December 1899.
He had been appointed to this post to quell the <a>Boxer Uprising</a> in the province and to reassure the foreign diplomats in the country who were looking for quick decisive actions against the boxers.
</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In 1901, Yuan Shikai sent a draft for the university charter () to the <a>Guangxu Emperor</a> and instructed Li Yukai, the magistrate of Penglai, to start preparations for the university.
Hence, he invited the American Presbyterian missionary Dr. <a>Watson McMillan Hayes</a> (, 1857&#x2013;1944) who was then serving as president of Tengchow College; Shandong College was closed on Sundays right from the start.
Hayes went on to teach the Presbyterian Mission Theological Class in Chefoo (present-day <a>Yantai</a>) and continued to work as a missionary and educator in Shandong until his death in a <a>Japanese internment camp</a> in Wei County (present-day Weifang) in 1944.
</p>
<p>Shandong College occupied the premises of the Luoyuan Academy which had been renovated and extended significantly 5 years earlier.
It was opened officially on November 13, 1901 in a ceremony attended by Governor Yuan Shikai and had since then followed a career that had been closely linked to Yuan Shikai.
In establishing the university, the German authorities took a much more accommodating approach towards the Chinese government than they had taken in the annexation of the territory.
The negotiations over the establishment of the school were led by sinologist Otto Franke.
Studies were organized in a &quot;preparatory level&quot; with a six-year (since 1911, five-year) curriculum for students aged 13 to 15 years and an &quot;upper school&quot; who had built a reputation mainly for ruthlessness, brutality, and colorful antics, ordered the fusion of six schools into a provincial Shandong University () in Jinan in 1926.
Shandong University was also completely paralyzed by the events.
The biology department was moved to Tai'an and merged into the Shandong Agricultural College.</p>
<h3>Recent history (1980-present)</h3>
<p>Shandong University at Weihai was established in 1984.
In 1985, Shandong Medical College was renamed Shandong Medical University.
From 1986 to 1996, Shandong University underwent a period of rapid academic expansion.
In 1948, the Yifan Girls' Middle School was combined with Liming Middle School  () and its former campus became part of the Shandong Agricultural Institute that used it until 1958, when the Institute moved to <a>Tai'an</a>.
In October 1958, the Hongjialou Campus became Shandong University's first Campus after the University moved back to Jinan from Qingdao.
As a result, the buildings feature Chinese-style roofs on buildings that lack the matching support elements such as wooden <a>Dougong</a> brackets that characterize Chinese architecture.
Historical buildings on the Baotuquan Campus include the  Bergen Science Hall (, formerly for Chemistry and Biology), the Matteer Science Hall (formerly for Physics and Physiology), the  McCormick Hall, and the Alumni Gate (the former main entrance, construction completed on June 17, 1924).
At present, Baotuquan Campus houses the schools of public health, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, and medicine.</p>
<h3>Qianfoshan Campus</h3>
<p>The Qianfoshan Campus was established in 1949 and served as the campus of Shandong University of Technology.
It became a part of Shandong University when Shandong University of Technology was merged into Shandong University in July 2000.
The campus has a total area of about 420,000 square meters and remains exclusively dedicated to engineering.
It is home to the schools of Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Technology, Control Science and Engineering, Energy and Power Engineering, Physical Education, as well as Civil Engineering.</p>
<h3>Xinglongshan Campus</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|Xinglongshan Campus in April 2005</a> The Xinglongshan Campus is the newest campus of Shandong University and also its largest campus in Jinan with an  area of about 769,000 square meters.
Construction of the campus started in March 2003 and its first facilities were ready for use in August 2004.
The campus is used to house first- and second-year students of nine different departments.
