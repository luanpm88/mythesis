In his 1938 book, <em>Bricks Without Straw: The Story of Linfield College</em>, Professor Jonas A. &quot;Steine&quot; Jonasson quotes from the minutes of the college's board of trustees to explain Mrs. Linfield's motivation for her large land gift to the college: &quot;Mrs.
Linfield's dual purpose in making the gift to McMinnville College was to 'perpetuate the name, scholarly attainments and Christian influence of her late husband, Rev. George Fisher Linfield, and to promote the cause of Christian education.'</p>
