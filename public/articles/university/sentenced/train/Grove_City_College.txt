<p></p>
<p><strong>Grove City College</strong> is a <a>Christian</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Grove City</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, about sixty-five miles north of <a>Pittsburgh</a>.
According to the College Bulletin, its stated three-fold mission is to provide an excellent education at an affordable price in a thoroughly Christian environment.
College president <a>Richard Jewell</a> has said, &quot;The two tenets that this school [finds most important] are faith and freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>The school emphasizes a <a>humanities</a> <a>core curriculum</a>, which endorses the <a>Judeo-Christian</a> Western tradition and the <a>free market</a>.
While loosely associated with the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>, the college is <a>non-denominational</a> and does not require students to sign a <a>statement of faith</a>, though they are required to attend sixteen <a>chapel</a> services per semester.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Founded in 1876 by <a>Isaac C. Ketler</a>, the school was originally chartered as Pine Grove Normal Academy.
It had twenty-six students in its first year.
In 1884, the trustees of Pine Grove Normal Academy in Grove City amended the academy charter to change the name to Grove City College.
By charter, the doors of the College were open to qualified students &quot;without regard to religious test or belief.&quot;
The founders of Grove City College, consciously avoiding narrow sectarianism, held a vision of Christian society transcending denomination, creeds, and confessions.
Isaac Ketler was a devout <a>Presbyterian</a> who served as president until 1913.
This was a span of 37 years altogether, and occurred during a very formative period for the school.</p>
<p>Grove City was heavily supported by <a>Joseph Newton Pew</a>, founder of the <a>Sun Oil Company</a>.
Pew was one of Ketler's grade-school teachers and a lifelong mentor and friend of the educator.
Ketler and Pew would ultimately forge a remarkable relationship that would profoundly influence the purpose and character of Grove City College.
Pew, like Ketler a devout Presbyterian and strong believer in the importance of good education, later accepted the presidency of the school's board of trustees.
Pew and Ketler's influence continued with their sons, <a>Weir C. Ketler</a> (Grove City president from 1916 to 1956) and <a>Joseph Howard Pew</a>.</p>
<p>Joseph Howard Pew graduated from the college in 1900 and, like his father, became trustee-board president.
<a>J.
Howard Pew</a> continued his father's legacy, richly contributing to the school's programs.
A Presbyterian as devout as his father, and a conservative, J.
Howard Pew insisted that the college operate only on what it received in tuition and fees.
In the 1930s, J.
Howard Pew, who became the president of <a>Sun Oil Company</a>, was one of the nation's most outspoken critics of the <a>New Deal</a>, so it also was natural that Grove City College look unfavorably upon federal aid and involvement in education and that it would strive to remain the highly independent institution it is today.
<a>Joseph Howard Pew</a> once said that his two major philanthropic causes were GCC and <a>The Pew Charitable Trusts</a>.
In October 2004, the college dedicated a statue to his memory outside of the college's Harbison Chapel.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court case</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Under President Dr. Charles S. MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> case in 1984, <em>Grove City College v. Bell</em>.
The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a <a>Title IX</a> compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even future ones not yet issued.
The court ruled 6-3 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants did fall under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but limited the application to the school's financial aid department.</p>
<p>In 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements.
In response, Grove City College withdrew from the <a>Stafford loan</a> program entirely beginning with the 1988-89 academic year, and established its own loan program with <a>PNC Bank</a>.
The move earned the respect and admiration of many influential academics, including David Warren, the president of the National Association of Colleges and Universities.
Warren said in a 1996 interview that Grove City has a &quot;history of making bold and principled decisions.
And a lot of colleges sympathize with what they've done.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2005, Grove City founded its <a>Center for Vision and Values</a>, further advancing its programs in the <a>humanities</a>.
The Center aims to educate the world about faith and freedom by giving its faculty members the opportunity to share their scholarship with a community beyond <a>Pennsylvania</a>.
One of the center&#x2019;s initiatives is to establishing an annual conference aimed at attracting some of the best minds from around the world to talk about topics of national and international importance.</p>
<p>In recent years, the college has engaged in many new construction projects, including an expansion to the college's music and arts center in 2002, a new academic building in 2003, a new student union/bookstore in 2004, and new apartment style housing in 2006.
Grove City's Student Union building was honored with the International Masonry Institute's Golden Trowel Grand Prize for excellence in masonry design and construction in 2005.
Even more construction projects, and renovations of existing buildings are planned for the next few years.</p>
<p>The college acquired an <a>observatory</a> from <a>Edinboro University of Pennsylvania</a> in February 2008 that will be utilized for <a>astronomy</a> classes as well as faculty and student <a>research</a>.
The observatory's <a>telescope</a> will be operated more than 60 miles away remotely from the college's main campus.
The purchase of the property, three buildings and equipment inside will pave the way for the addition of an <a>astronomy</a> minor on campus.
Through this <a>observatory</a>, the college's physics department plans to work with area public schools as well as other colleges and universities on educational and research projects and draw prospective students who are looking for strong <a>physics</a> programs and <a>astronomy</a> coursework.</p>

<p>In two consecutive nationwide studies made by the <a>Intercollegiate Studies Institute</a> (ISI) in cooperation with researchers from the <a>University of Connecticut</a>'s Department of Public Policy to determine the extent of civic literacy in higher education, Grove City College students ranked among the top 5 nationally in terms of knowledge of U.S. history, government, economy and international relations.
The study was based on the results of a multiple-choice test given to 14,000 randomly chosen freshmen and seniors on 50 college and university campuses.
In two consecutive years of ISI's study, Grove City was ranked number 4 in 2006 and number 2 in 2007, above most Ivy league universities.

Only 12 schools in the <a>USA</a> received the highest rating.
The high grade &quot;means that students generally feel safe, campus police are visible, blue-light phones and escort services are readily available, and safety precautions are not overly necessary,&quot; according to the College Prowler guide.
The rating is a result of the recommendation of the guide&#x2019;s student author, direct student feedback and other factors such as the presence and size of a police force and security staff, services provided, the area and campus crime reports, security of dormitories and the prevalence of campus theft.</p>
<h3>Connections to think tanks</h3>
<p>Although it is a small liberal arts college, Grove City's faculty and administrators significantly influence and impact the ideas of various <a>think tanks</a> around the USA especially on issues involving the environment, <a>education</a>, <a>minimum wage</a>, and anything economic and conservative.
Grove City College has <a>international</a> ties, founded in 1955, and on the International Society for Individual Liberty (ISIL) Freedom Network.</p>
<p>Among them are the Shenango Institute for Public Policy, a Western Pennsylvania based non-partisan research and educational institute whose mission is to formulate and promote public policies at the local-government level based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom and responsibility, and a respect for traditional values.</p>

<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>Students are required to take general requirements courses, with science, mathematics/reasoning, and several other courses.
The base of the general requirements are centered around a humanities core, with courses on Western Civilization, Art, <a>Literature</a>, and <a>Biblical Revelation</a>.
Requirements for majors differ, but typically a student is also required to gain mastery in a foreign language and reach some mathematical proficiency.
Many Grove City students take one to three general requirements classes in their freshman, sophomore, and sometimes junior years, along with classes for their respective major.</p>
<p>Many students choose Grove City explicitly for its <a>Christian</a> environment and strong, traditional <a>Humanities</a> curriculum.

<h3>Policies and environment</h3>
<p>When it opened, Grove City College was one of the first institutions of higher learning in the United States to admit both male and female students.
Among them are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Orientation Board (OB) &ndash; welcomes the incoming students beginning on move-in day and throughout the year.
The group also plans and holds numerous events the first week freshmen arrive on campus.</li>
<li>Student Government Association &ndash; acts as the primary communication link between the students and the administration.
Members are elected by the student body.</li>
<li>Touring Choir &ndash; rehearses and performs a varying repertoire of choral music at locations throughout Western Pennsylvania and on its annual tour during Easter break.</li>
<li>Stonebridge &ndash; brings Christian artists to campus and facilitates concerts.</li>
<li>Project Okello &ndash; the group's purpose is to be an instrument of hope, healing and Christ&#x2019;s love to the people of Uganda through prayer and action..</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publications and media</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Bridge</em> &ndash; yearbook published in the fall.</li>

<li><em>The Entrepreneur</em> &ndash; promotes free market economics through student and faculty articles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WSAJ radio</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Assigned its call letters in April 1920, the Grove City College radio station, WSAJ-AM, was one of the first radio stations in the country.
The call-letters were predated by experimental stations at the college dating back to 1914.
In 1968, WSAJ-FM was put on the air and currently broadcasts at 91.1 FM, functioning as a learning tool for all students, but especially those in the communication and engineering majors.
The 100-watt AM station, operating from a longwire antenna on 1340&nbsp;kHz, was one of the few remaining stations in the U.S. to share time.
It surrendered its broadcast license in 2006.
The 1,600-watt FM signal covers a 30-mile radius in Western Pennsylvania.
The station broadcasts fine arts programming, college football and basketball games.
It also airs community events and high school sports.
Students host weekly music shows during the evening hours when school is in session.</p>
<h3>Fraternities, sororities, and housing groups</h3>
<p><a>Fraternities and sororities</a> live on campus, in pre-selected upperclassman halls.
Strict regulations apply to students joining a Greek organization.
Grove City's fraternities and sororities are not affiliated with any national groups.
Over the years, many sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have permanently died out.
The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.
Fraternities that have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) and been reinstituted via block classes include Beta Sigma, Sigma Alpha Sigma, and Adelphikos.
All three of these fraternities are currently in existence.
Other Greek organizations have retained an unbroken line of membership throughout their histories.
</p>
<p>Both fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies.
The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council.
The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week.
In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games.
The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.</p>
<p>Male students who do not join fraternities can obtain block housing privileges through one of nine organizations known as housing groups.
Grove City College housing groups are collections of similarly-interested students which enjoy block housing, yet are not fraternal or Greek in nature.
Such groups were founded in the 1970s and given permission to use Greek letters by the extant fraternities on campus and the Grove City College administration.
The first of these organizations was Alpha Sigma in 1974.
Greek organizations have taken issue with the purported failure of housing groups to abide according to the original founding stipulations, which include having a common purpose and limiting membership to those living in groups' respective dorm halls.
There are no female housing groups at the college.</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>The Quad</h3>
<p>Lying in the center of Grove City College Campus is the quadrangle, or &quot;quad.&quot;
Students have historically been prohibited by the administration from walking on the grass in this area.
In recent years, restrictions have laxed, and the quad has been the subject of controversy among students and faculty.
In the fall of 2005, the student government association voted to open the Upper Quad to &quot;light athletic activities&quot; and the administration established new policies for quad use.
The Lower Quad remained off-limits - only used for such events as baccalaureate, commencement, and homecoming - until the fall of 2009, when it was also opened for use.
<a>thumb|350px|right|Rainbow Bridge, which stretches over Wolf Creek and connects upper and lower campus.</a></p>
<h3>Greek Village</h3>
<p>Each fall during Homecoming Weekend, the fraternities and sororities set up tents in which to meet, greet, and sometimes eat with their returning alumni.
These tents make up Grove City College's Greek Village.
The Greek Village has typically been set up on Lower Campus, near the football field, but in 2005 the tents were set up on Upper Campus, on the Quad.
While most of the tents belong to fraternities and sororities, some other organizations also have been known to share a space in the Village.</p>
<h3>&quot;Creeking&quot;</h3>
<p>The ritual of &quot;creeking&quot; takes place for two reasons: most primarily when a male Grove City student becomes engaged, and also when a fraternity man has been elected as the sweetheart of a sorority.
The creeking is carried out by a group of men, typically the subject's friends, who subdue the man to be creeked and carrying him from his dorm building down to Wolf Creek in the center of campus while chanting, &quot;Wolf Creek.&quot;
Upon reaching the creek the friends toss the subject in, with some groups pausing for a speech by a senior member of the group.
If the bride-to-be does not reach her fianc&#x00e9; with a towel when he is coming out of the creek, then he is allowed to throw her in as well.</p>
<h3>Welcome Week</h3>
<p>Welcome Week (also known as &quot;OB Week&quot;) is a series of events between the Thursday when new students arrive and the end of the first week of classes.
Several events notable in campus culture occur during this week, including dances, a bonfire, student-led worship services, and a comedic stage production.
The events are managed by the college's Orientation Board, and play a large role in introducing new students with Grove City's campus culture.</p>
