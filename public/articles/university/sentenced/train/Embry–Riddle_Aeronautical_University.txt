<p><strong>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</strong> (generally referred to as <strong>Riddle</strong> or <strong>ERAU</strong>) is a <a>private</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>university</a> with a history dating from the early days of aviation.
Students are enrolled in one of two residential campuses located in <a>Daytona Beach, Florida</a>, and <a>Prescott, Arizona</a>, or in <a>Embry-Riddle Worldwide</a>, composed of over 130 non-residential campuses and online programs.
The residential campuses provide education in a traditional setting while Embry-Riddle Worldwide serves civilian and military working adults.</p>
<p>Embry-Riddle began in 1925 as the <strong>Embry-Riddle Company</strong>, an aircraft dealer and airmail provider, founded by <a>Talton Higbee Embry</a> and <a>John Paul Riddle</a> in <a>Cincinnati</a>, <a>Ohio</a>.
Embry-Riddle was eventually incorporated into what is now <a>American Airlines</a>, before reforming during the buildup to <a>World War II</a> in <a>Miami, Florida</a>, as the <strong>Embry-Riddle School of Aviation</strong>, and later, the <strong>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Institute</strong>.
Embry-Riddle moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1965 and was renamed Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1970.
The Prescott, Arizona, campus opened in 1978.</p>
<p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is an <a>accredited</a> aviation-oriented university.
The university utilizes a fleet of over 90 aircraft and serves culturally diverse students primarily motivated toward careers in aviation and aerospace.
The university offers <a>bachelor's</a> degrees, <a>master's</a> degrees and recently announced <a>PhD</a> degrees in Aviation and in Engineering Physics at the Daytona Beach Campus and through Embry-Riddle Worldwide.
<a>Bachelor's</a> degrees, <a>associate's</a> degrees and non-degree programs are also offered by Embry-Riddle Worldwide.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early days</h3>
<p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University began on December 17, 1925, exactly 22 years after the <a>Wright Brothers</a>' first flight, when <a>Talton Higbee Embry</a> and <a>John Paul Riddle</a> formed the Embry-Riddle Company at <a>Lunken Airport</a> in <a>Cincinnati</a>, <a>Ohio</a>.
The company was financed by Embry, a wealthy aviation enthusiast who served as company president.
Riddle was named general plumber, and the two began to sell <a>Waco Aircraft</a> in Cincinnati.
In spring of 1926 (the date shown on the university seal), the Embry-Riddle Company opened the <strong>Embry-Riddle Flying School</strong>.
On December 17, 1927, the Embry-Riddle Company established Cincinnati's first regular air mail service, from Cincinnati to <a>Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The school grew rapidly in 1928 and 1929, until the Embry-Riddle Company (now the <strong>Embry-Riddle Aviation Corporation</strong>) was merged with the <a>Aviation Corporation (AVCO)</a> of <a>Delaware</a>.
AVCO phased out the Embry-Riddle Flying School in the fall of 1930.
Shortly after, AVCO became American Airways (the predecessor of <a>American Airlines</a>), and the Embry-Riddle Company was gone.</p>
<p>Riddle and McKay also formed the Riddle Aeronautical Institute at <a>Carlstrom Field</a>, in early 1941 for the purpose of training pilots for the <a>United States Army Air Corps</a>.
A separate division of Embry-Riddle provided technical training in maintenance and metal work.
Following <a>Pearl Harbor</a>, Embry-Riddle and its various divisions expanded rapidly to train professionals during the war, and the Carlstrom Field facility trained pilots for the <a>Royal Air Force</a>, while nearby Dorr Field prepared pilots for advanced training with the <a>U.S. Army Air Forces</a>.
ERAI continued the training of pilots and mechanics in Miami until April 1965, when Hunt moved the campus to its current home in [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]].</pre>
<p>Embry-Riddle's move from Miami was accomplished by a group of Daytona Beach civic leaders known as the Committee of 100.
The school was packed into trucks and moved nearly overnight.
Known as &quot;Operation Bootstrap&quot;, the move was accomplished with the help of the [[Daytona Beach News-Journal]], which supplied the trucks.</pre>
<p>The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Institute was <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> in 1968 and was renamed Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1970.</p>
<p>Hunt headed a large expansion of Embry-Riddle, including the purchase of a second campus in <a>Prescott</a>, <a>Arizona</a>, in 1978.
Embry-Riddle purchased the former campus of <a>Prescott College</a>, which closed abruptly in 1974 from financial hardship.
Hunt served as president until his death on January 7, 1984.
Hunt was followed by [[Kenneth L. Tallman|Lt.
General Kenneth L. Tallman]], who, in his five years as president, formed Embry-Riddle's first graduate program.
Tallman also added undergraduate degrees in Engineering Physics and Electrical Engineering.</pre>
<p>Embry-Riddle's third president was Dr. Steven M. Sliwa, who presided over the university from 1991 until 1998.
Sliwa oversaw the largest expansion in Embry-Riddle's history, developing new majors and a capital expansion in excess of $100 <a>million</a>.</pre>

his tenure as president, Ebbs expanded Embry-Riddle into non-traditional university projects, such as Embry-Riddle's Commercial Airline Pilot Training program (CAPT program), which was sold in 2006.
Ebbs also entered the university into a five-year contract with The [[United States Air Force Academy]] for Embry-Riddle to provide flight training for its cadets in 2002.</pre>
<p>Embry-Riddle's fifth president is <a>Dr.
John P. Johnson</a>.
Johnson was previously University <a>Provost</a> and Interim President.
He was selected after a national search by the <a>Board of Trustees</a> on August 8, 2006.</pre>
<h2>Organization</h2>
