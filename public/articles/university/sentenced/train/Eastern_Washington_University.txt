<h2>History</h2>
<p>EWU was established in 1882 by a $10,000 grant from expressman <a>Benjamin Pierce Cheney</a>, and was originally known as <strong>Benjamin P. Cheney Academy</strong> to honor its founder.
In 1889 the school was renamed <strong>State Normal School</strong> and in 1937 to <strong>Eastern Washington College of Education</strong>.
The campus grew quickly in size following <a>World War II</a>.
The school became <strong>Eastern Washington State College</strong>.
During this era, Eastern added various graduate and undergraduate degree programs.
In 1977, the school's name was changed for the final time to <strong>Eastern Washington University</strong> by the <a>Washington State Legislature</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;br&gt; Eastern's sports mascot is the <a>Eagle</a>, named &quot;Swoop,&quot; and its colors are <a>red</a> and <a>white</a>.
The former mascot of the school was the &quot;Savages&quot;, which was dropped in 1973 when the student body voted to change to the Eagles.
(See <a>Native American mascot controversy</a>.)
EWU athletic teams participate in the <a>Big Sky Conference</a> at the <a>NCAA</a> Division I (I - FCS for <a>football</a>) level.

The grass surface was replaced for the 2010 season with a red Sprinturf field.
The field was originally named after one of the university's first head coaches, but after a $500,000 donation by former EWU player and current NFL player, <a>Michael Roos</a> starting offensive tackle for the NFL's Tennessee Titans, the field was renamed in 2010.

The university's most prominent sports have traditionally been its football and men's basketball teams with the women's volleyball team having some good years, finishing the season in the Division 1 top 25 in 2003 (oddly, because they lost the Big Sky Championship game, they were the only top 25 team excluded from the tournament).
Originally an NAIA school until joining the Big Sky Conference, the Eagles gained major prominence in the NAIA and Division II winning National and Regional championships, including a National championship in Wrestling (the sport was dropped in the 80's).
In 2007, <a>point guard</a> <a>Rodney Stuckey</a> was drafted 15th overall by the <a>Detroit Pistons</a>.
