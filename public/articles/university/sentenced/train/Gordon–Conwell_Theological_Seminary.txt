<p><strong>Gordon&#x2013;Conwell Theological Seminary</strong> (<strong>GCTS</strong>) is an <a>evangelical</a> theological <a>seminary</a> based in <a>South Hamilton, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gordon-Conwell was founded in 1969, with <a>theologian</a> <a>Harold Ockenga</a> as its first president.
It has a doubly-<a>Baptist</a> <a>theological</a> heritage: it is the product of a merger between Gordon Divinity School, formerly of <a>Gordon College</a> in <a>Wenham, Massachusetts</a>, and the Conwell School of Theology, formerly of <a>Temple University</a> in <a>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>.
Both <a>Adoniram Judson Gordon</a> and <a>Russell Conwell</a> were Baptist ministers; Gordon's divinity school was first established as Gordon Bible Institute in 1889, while Conwell's theological school was originally chartered as <a>Temple College</a> in 1888.</p>
<p>Ockenga had wanted a strong <a>evangelical</a> voice in <a>New England</a> to contend with more <a>liberal</a> schools like <a>Harvard</a> and <a>Boston University</a>.
With the financial backing of <a>J.
Howard Pew</a> and the unifying influence of <a>evangelist</a> <a>Billy Graham</a>, Ockenga saw the two schools shed their theological and divinity schools and join them as Gordon-Conwell.
Other former presidents include Robert Cooley (1981&#x2013;1997), <a>Walter Kaiser, Jr.</a> (1997&#x2013;2006), and <a>James Emery White</a> (2006&#x2013;2007), and <a>Haddon Robinson</a> (2007&#x2013;2008).</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The main   <a>residential</a> campus is in <a>South Hamilton, Massachusetts</a>.
There are secondary campuses in <a>Boston</a> and in <a>Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, with an extension site in <a>Jacksonville, Florida</a>.
The campus in Boston is known as the Center for Urban Ministerial Education (CUME), and it is a program offered exclusively through part-time night and weekend classes.
The Charlotte program is offered on weekends, evenings and through week-long intensive courses, and generally attracts an older student body.
The newest extension site opened in 2006 and is located in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The seminary has a <a>Baptist</a> heritage but has no specific <a>Christian denomination</a>al affiliation.
It is part of the <a>Boston Theological Institute</a> (BTI), a consortium of nine theological schools in the <a>Greater Boston</a> area.
</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>There were 2,008 students enrolled at Gordon-Conwell in 2007.
The seminary offers over 19 degrees including the <a>Master of Divinity</a> (M.Div.), <a>Master of Theology</a> (Th.M.), <a>Doctor of Ministry</a> (D.Min.), and a wide range of specialized <a>master's degrees</a>.</p>
<p>Gordon-Conwell has been <a>accredited</a> by the <a>Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada</a> since 1964 and by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> since 1985.
It is also certified by the United States Government for the training of veterans and the education of chaplains for military service.</p>
