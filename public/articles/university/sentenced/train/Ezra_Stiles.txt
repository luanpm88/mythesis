<p> <strong>Ezra Stiles</strong> (November 29, 1727 &ndash; May 12, 1795) was an American academic and educator, a <a>Congregationalist</a> minister, <a>theologian</a> and author.
He was <a>president</a> of <a>Yale College</a> (1778&#x2013;1795).</p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>[[File:Ezra Stiles diploma Yale College class of 1746.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Yale
College]] diploma, Ezra Stiles, Class of 1746]] Born the son of the Rev. Isaac Stiles in <a>North Haven, Connecticut</a>, Ezra Stiles graduated from Yale in 1746.
He studied <a>theology</a> and was ordained in 1749, tutoring at Yale from that year until 1755.
Resigning from the ministry, he studied law and practiced at <a>New Haven</a> from 1753 to 1755, when he returned to the ministry for 22 years.
<a>Trinity Church</a>, the Anglican Church in <a>Newport, Rhode Island</a>, offered him an opportunity to become its minister, but he turned the offer down to become pastor of the <a>Second Congregational Church</a> in <a>Newport, Rhode Island</a> from 1755 until 1777.
While in Newport, he also served as Librarian of the <a>Redwood Library and Athenaeum</a> and kept an informative diary of his life and distinguished acquaintances in Newport, including his association with <a>Aaron Lopez</a>.
The <a>Ezra Stiles House</a> in Newport is on the National Historic Register.
With  arrival of British troops in Newport in late 1776, Stiles left Newport and became pastor of the Congregational Church at <a>Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a> from 1777 until 1778, when he became president of Yale until his death.
Stiles owned at least one slave, named &quot;Newport,&quot; whom he freed on June 9, 1778.</p>
<p>He married twice (Elizabeth Hubbard and Mary Checkley Cranston) and had eight children.
Stiles' son Ezra Stiles, Esq., was educated first at Yale College, then at <a>Harvard College</a>, where he studied law, graduating in 1778.
Ezra Stiles Jr. subsequently settled in <a>Vermont</a>, and served to establish the boundaries between Vermont and <a>New Hampshire</a>.
He died prematurely at <a>Chowan County, North Carolina</a> on Aug. 22, 1784, and his two daughters by his wife Sylvia (Avery) Stiles of Vermont (and formerly of <a>Norwich, Connecticut</a>) had their uncle <a>Jonathan Leavitt</a> appointed their guardian.</p>
<p>His daughter Emilia married Judge and State Senator <a>Jonathan Leavitt</a> of <a>Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>.
His daughter Mary married, in 1790, <a>Abiel Holmes</a>, a <a>Congregational</a> clergyman and historian and a 1783 graduate of Yale College.
By the second marriage to Sarah Wendell, Abiel was the father of <a>Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a></p>
<h3>Foundation of Brown University</h3>
<p>In 1764, Stiles played an influential role in the establishment of the <a>College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a> (the original name for <a>Brown University</a>) by contributing substantially to the drafting of its charter and by serving with thirty-five others - including <a>Stephen Hopkins</a>, <a>William Ellery</a>, <a>Samuel Ward</a>, the Reverend <a>John Gano</a>, the Reverend <a>Samuel Stillman</a>, and the Reverend <a>James Manning</a> - as a founding fellow or trustee.</p>
<h2>American Revolution</h2>

Stiles's map of the British forces invading [[New Haven, Connecticut]], July 1779]] Ezra Stiles was also a dedicated supporter of the <a>American Revolution</a>ary cause, and an avid amateur scientist who corresponded with <a>Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a>Benjamin Franklin</a> about scientific discoveries.
Using equipment donated to the college by Franklin, Stiles conducted the first electrical experiments in <a>New England</a>.</p>
<p>A book he authored, <em><a>The United States elevated to Glory and Honor</a></em> was printed in 1783.</p>
<h2>Biblical Scholarship</h2>
<p>Stiles struck up a close friendship with <a>Rabbi</a> <a>Haim Isaac Carigal</a> during Carigal's six month residence in Newport in 1773, the two meeting 28 times (according to Stiles' records) to discuss a wide variety of topics, ranging from <a>Kabbalah</a> to the politics of the <a>Holy Land</a>.
In addition, Stiles took the opportunity to improve his rudimentary knowledge of the <a>Hebrew language</a>, to the point where he and Carigal were to correspond by mail in Hebrew.
[[Image:Ezra Stiles House Newport.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[Ezra Stiles House]] in <a>Newport, Rhode Island</a>]] Stiles' knowledge of Hebrew also enabled him to translate large portions of the Hebrew <a>Old Testament</a> into English.
Stiles believed, as did many Christian scholars of the time, that facility with the text in its original language was advantageous for proper interpretation.</p>
<h2>Yale Presidency</h2>
<p>[[File:Ezra Stiles George Washington Honorary Degree.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Letter
from Stiles to [[George Washington]] announcing the awarding of an <a>Honorary degree</a> to Washington by President and Fellows of <a>Yale College</a>, 1781]] As president of Yale, Stiles also became its first professor of <a>Semitic</a>s, and required all students to study Hebrew (as was also the case at <a>Harvard</a>); his first <a>commencement address</a> in September, 1781 (no ceremonies having been held during the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>) was delivered in Hebrew, <a>Aramaic</a>, and <a>Arabic</a>.
By 1790, however, he was forced to face failure in instilling an interest in the language in the student body, writing :&quot;From my first accession to the Presidency ... I have obliged all the Freshmen to study Hebrew.
This has proved very disagreeable to a Number of the Students.
This year I have determined to instruct only those who offer themselves voluntarily.&quot;
The <a>valedictorian</a>s of 1785 and 1792, however, did deliver their speeches in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Yale's legacy from this interest of Stiles' includes a <a>portrait</a> of Carigal by <a>artist</a> Samuel King, and the Hebrew words <a>&quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot;</a> (&#x05d0;&#x05d5;&#x05e8;&#x05d9;&#x05dd; &#x05d5;&#x05ea;&#x05de;&#x05d9;&#x05dd;) on the Yale seal.

Volume carries notation: &quot;Given to the Library of Yale College by Ezra Stiles 1785.&quot;]]
Named in his honor is <a>Ezra Stiles College</a>, one of Yale's residential colleges.
Also noted is its <a>Eero Saarinen</a> design, particularly the building's lack of right angles between walls.
The college's <a>mascot</a> is the <a>moose</a>, inspired by the installation in the dining hall of a stuffed moose head in honor of former college master and Yale president <a>A.
Bartlett Giamatti</a>.
Adjacent to Ezra Stiles College is its near architectural twin, <a>Morse College</a>, named for <a>Samuel F.B. Morse</a>.</p>
