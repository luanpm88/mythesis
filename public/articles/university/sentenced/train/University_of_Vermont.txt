<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Vermont was founded as a private university, in 1791, the same year Vermont became the 14th state in the union.
In 1865, the university merged with Vermont Agricultural College (chartered November 22, 1864, after the passage of the <a>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a>), emerging as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College.
Today, the university blends the traditions of both a private and public university.
UVM draws 7 percent of its general fund (approximately 10 percent of its current operating budget) from the state and Vermont residents make up 35 percent of enrollment; 65 percent of students come from other states and countries.</p>
<p>Much of the initial funding and planning for the university was undertaken by <a>Ira Allen</a>, who is honored as UVM's founder.
Allen donated a  parcel of land for the University's establishment.
Most of this land has been maintained as the university's main green, upon which stands a statue of Allen.</p>
<p>The citizens of Burlington helped fund the university's first edifice, and, when fire destroyed it in 1824, also paid for its replacement.
This building came to be known as &quot;Old Mill&quot; for its resemblance to New England mills of the time.
The <a>Marquis de Lafayette</a>, a French general who became a commander in the American Revolution, <a>toured all 24 US states in 1824/5</a> and while in Vermont laid the cornerstone of Old Mill, which stands on University Row, along with Ira Allen Chapel, Billings Center, Williams Hall, Royall Tyler Theatre and Morrill Hall.
A statue of Lafayette stands at the north end of the main green.</p>
<p>Bachelors, masters, and doctoral programs are offered through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education and Social Services, the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, the College of Medicine, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, the Graduate College, the School of Business Administration, and The <a>Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources</a>.</p>

Courses are presented in classroom, online, and/or interactive television formats.</p>
