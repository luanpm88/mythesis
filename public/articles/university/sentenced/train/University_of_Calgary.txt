<h2>History and overview</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|Central School Calgary, 1905</a> <a>thumb|left|Murray Fraser Hall, University of Calgary Campus</a> The University of Calgary was established in 1966, yet its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal School in <a>Calgary</a> in 1905.
The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province.
The people of Calgary, however, attempted to establish another publicly-funded university in Calgary itself.
&quot;An Act to Incorporate the University of Calgary&quot; was presented for first reading as a Bill in the <a>Alberta Legislature</a> in an attempt to establish a private university in Calgary.
The Legislature allowed the institution to incorporate as 'Calgary College', rather than as the 'University of Calgary'.
It withheld from the College the powers to confer degrees and to hold the examinations required for admission to the professions.
</p>
<p>Calgary strove to have an <a>institute</a> of higher learning with degree conferring powers which led to the University of Alberta opening a branch in Calgary in 1945.
The University of Alberta Calgary Branch eventually gained full autonomy in 1966 and became the University of Calgary.
</p>
<p>The university was modeled on the <a>American</a> state university (similar to the <a>University of Alberta</a>), with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.
The governance was modeled on the provincial <a>University of Toronto</a> Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond <a>theology</a>, <a>law</a> and <a>medicine</a>.
Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.</p>
<p>The university's first <a>president</a>, Herbert Stoker Armstrong, held a strong belief that <em>&quot;although the university is accountable to the society that supports it, the university must insist on playing a leadership role in intellectual matters if it is to be worthy of the name.&quot;</em></p>
<p>During the late 1960s, the University of Calgary saw a massive construction boom.
Construction on campus included Blocks F and G of Calgary Hall, Blocks C and D of the Engineering Building, the lab of the Kananaskis Centre, a research, training, and service unit, and the opening of the new University <a>Theatre</a> in Calgary Hall.
In addition, <a>Banff Centre</a> (originally known as The Banff School of Fine Arts) became affiliated with the University of Calgary.
The School of Social Welfare was also established.
Total full-time enrolment in 1966 exceeded 4000 students and there were 355 academic members of staff.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>The U of C is in the midst of its largest capital expansion ever.
Fuelled by <a>Alberta</a>&#x2019;s nation-leading economic growth, the university has embarked upon a plan to add capacity for more students and a host of new teaching and research activities.
These major developments, including the Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL), the U of C downtown campus and the new Energy, Environment and Experiential Learning building, are fulfilling distinct academic strategies and creating progressive learning environments.</p>
<p>The University of Calgary's Child Development Centre is Alberta's first&#x2014;and Canada's second largest&#x2014;building designed and constructed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, the <a>North American</a> benchmark for environmentally high-performance buildings.
The facility, which houses the university's second child-care facility and a full continuum of researchers, clinicians and frontline workers, is dedicated to <a>child health</a>.
The building officially opened in October, 2007.</p>
<p>Canada&#x2019;s fifth Faculty of <a>Veterinary</a> Medicine was opened at the U of C in mid-2008.
Research and graduate education programs will be focused on areas of strength and importance in Alberta and will fall in line with the college&#x2019;s areas of emphasis: production animal health, equine health, <a>ecosystem</a> and public health and investigative medicine.
The first class of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) students will began classes in the fall of 2008.</p>

<h2>Grounds</h2>
<h3>Main Campus</h3>
<p>The university grounds lie about 2 kilometres (1.2&nbsp;mi) north of <a>Downtown Calgary</a>, and immediately south of the neighbourhoods of Varsity and Dalhousie.
The U of C campus occupies more than 200 <a>hectares</a> (2.13 km2), an area larger than Calgary&#x2019;s entire downtown.
The campus is bounded by Crowchild Trail, 16 Avenue NW, 32 Avenue NW and Shaganappi Trail.
24 Avenue NW provides direct access to the interior of the campus.</p>
<p>The architecture is defined by a combination of <a>Gothic Revival</a>, <a>Brutalist</a> and Postmodern buildings spread across campus, most of them dated between 1905 and 1980.
The dramatic effect of this blended design of different architecture has drawn a considerable amount of praise.</p>
<h3>West Campus</h3>
<p>In 1995, the Province of Alberta gave the University of Calgary a large tract of land west of the Main Campus with the understanding it would be used in the future to advance the University&#x2019;s mission, vision, values and priorities.
About a third of the size of downtown Calgary, the land overlooks the Bow River valley and covers 80 hectares (184 acres) east of Shaganappi Trail between 16th Avenue (TransCanada Highway) and 32 Avenue N.W.
The western campus  lies on mostly hilly terrain, near the Bow River.
It is adjacent to the main campus of the university, and is home to the <a>Alberta Children's Hospital</a> and Child Development Centre.
With the recent boost in annual funding, the U of C has begun a development plan in order to make better use of the remaining space.
</p>
<p>Five years ago, part of the West Campus was leased for the new Alberta Children&#x2019;s Hospital and a new <a>Ronald McDonald</a> House.
So far, the campus is only halfway developed and is considered building room for the future.
From this location, it is possible to see the entire university and also <a>Downtown Calgary</a>.</p>
<h3>Qatar Campus</h3>
<p>In 2007, the University of Calgary established a campus in <a>Doha, Qatar</a>, the University of Calgary - Qatar, which currently focuses upon nursing education.
The University of Calgary-Qatar offers a flexible, innovative, Bachelor of <a>Nursing</a> (BN) degree to prepare students for the opportunities and challenges of a rewarding nursing career.
Throughout the program, students are provided with a theoretical base and supervised clinical experience in a variety of nursing practice settings.</p>
<p>The University of Calgary offers two routes towards a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) degree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Regular Track program for high school and College of the <a>North Atlantic</a> - <a>Qatar</a> transfer students (BNRT)</li>
  <li>A Post-Diploma program for students with an acceptable Nursing diploma (PDBN)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, several graduate programs are expected to be phased in.</p>

Occupying two floors, with the Den located on the lower floor and the Black Lounge on the upper floor, in the warmer months of the year the second floor features a large outdoor <a>patio</a>.
Once run by the University of Calgary, the Den was taken over by the Students&#x2019; Union in 2000.</p>
<h3>The LDL</h3>
<p>The Last Defence Lounge (LDL) is run by the <a>University of Calgary Graduate Students' Association</a>.
A members-only club, it is open to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, staff and members of the public.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Calgary is home to the very first collegiate <a>fraternity</a> founded, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, whose Calgary chapter has been active since 1984.
</p>
<p>The Fraternity of <a>Phi Gamma Delta</a>, also known as Fiji or Phi Gam, is the other fraternity present at the university.
It was the first fraternity at the university which is still running, being on campus since 1982.
A friendly rivalry is shared between the two, as they are the only fraternities on campus.</p>
<p><a>Alpha Gamma Delta</a> and <a>Alpha Omicron Pi</a> are the two existing sororities at the U of C, being established in 1983 and 1985 respectively.
Toegther, they form the Panhellenic Association of Calgary.
The Panhellenic Association oversees all women's chapters and continually encourages the women to go above and beyond individual and shared expectations.</p>
<h3>Leadership on campus</h3>
<p>In 2009, the U of C's Office of the Student Experience launched their own co-curricular record, the first of its kind in western Canadian universities.
The co-curricular record is an official university document to be coupled with a student's academic transcript, that recognizes out-of-classroom experiences that are still connected to the university.</p>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
<p>A notable high school level scholarship is the <a>Alexander Rutherford</a> Scholarship which was introduced by the <a>Government of Alberta</a> in 1980.
The Alexander Rutherford scholarship is to recognize and reward exceptional academic achievement at the senior <a>high school</a> level and to encourage students to continue their studies.
To be considered for these scholarships, students must be a <a>Canadian citizen</a> or permanent resident who plan to enroll or are enrolled in a full-time post-secondary program of at least one <a>semester</a> in length.</p>
<p>The University joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret'd) <a>Rick Hillier</a>, for the families of fallen <a>Canadian Forces</a> members.
Dependents of Canadian Forces personnel killed while serving in active military missions will have the support of the University of Calgary to complete <a>undergraduate</a> degrees.</p>
<h2>Aboriginal</h2>
<p>Through the university&#x2019;s Native Ambassador Program Initiative, aboriginal students act as role models to younger students in their home communities.
To assist with transition to a career, the university is leading an Aboriginal Lynx Career and Employment Project with other universities including <a>University of Saskatchewan</a> and <a>University of Winnipeg</a>.</p>
<h2>Order of the University of Calgary</h2>
<p>The Order of the University of Calgary, developed in 1994 resulting from a suggestion brought forward from the University's Senate, honours worthy recipients who have a record of exemplary and <a>distinguished</a> service to the University.
