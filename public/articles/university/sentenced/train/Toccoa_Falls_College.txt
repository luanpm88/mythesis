<h2>History</h2>
<p> In 1907, Toccoa Falls College was founded by <a>R. A. Forrest</a> in Golden, <a>North Carolina</a> as the Golden Valley Institute.
On January 1, 1911, Forrest bought the Haddock Inn and  of land.
In October, he relocated the school to near <a>Toccoa, Georgia</a> in order to be near a mainline railroad.
He renamed the school Toccoa Falls Institute and added secondary school courses to the theological classes.</p>
<p>In 1913, the Haddock Inn, which was the classroom and residence building, was destroyed by fire.
After living in tents for a time, the school built a new campus.</p>
<p>In 1928 the secondary courses were reorganized and the state of <a>Georgia</a> accredited it as Toccoa Falls High School, which remained open until 1976.
In 1937, the state of Georgia chartered the four-year college program and allowed it to grant the degree <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> in Biblical Education.</p>
<p>On November 6, 1977, the <a>Kelly Barnes Dam</a>, built up and used by the college for electrical power since the Toccoa Falls Institute days, collapsed and the  lake it impounded drained through the lower part of the campus.
The resulting <a>flood</a> killed 39 people and injured 60 more, as well as destroying much of the on-campus married student housing, and damaging part of the men's dormitory.
The dam was never rebuilt.
With the destruction of the dam, and the draining of the lake, there exists no possibility of a similar flood.</p>
<p>The motto of the school is &quot;Where character is developed with intellect&quot;.</p>
<p>W.
Wayne Gardner became the sixth president of the college in 2004.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2009, Gate Cottage, one of the most historic buildings on campus, was destroyed by fire.
Gate Cottage was built in 1939 and was the fourth oldest building on campus.
It was one of few buildings that remained standing after the break of the Kelly Barnes Dam and flood that occurred in November 1977.
No one was in the building at the time of the fire.
Gate Cottage has been rebuilt with a bigger gift shop and dining area for various occasions, but without the School of Counseling.
The School of Counseling, which was once a part of Gate Cottage has been relocated to a new location between the Mission Building and Bandy Hall.</p>
