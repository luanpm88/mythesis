While the system's Board of Governors oversees general system policy, the campuses are classified as separate institutions and are largely autonomous from the system office.
The UNC system conferred 43,686 degrees for 2008-2009, the bulk of which were Bachelor's level with 31,055 degrees awarded.
The UNC system has a total enrollment of over 183,000 students and confers over 75% of all bachelor degrees in North Carolina in 2008.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Old Well and McCorkle Place 2005.jpg|left|thumb|The
[[Old Well]] on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus]] Founded in 1789, the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> is the <a>oldest public university in the United States</a>.
In 1877, the State of North Carolina began sponsoring additional higher education institutions.
Over time the state added a <a>women's college</a>, a <a>land-grant university</a>, five <a>historically black institutions</a>, and one to educate <a>Native Americans</a>.
Others were created to prepare <a>teachers for public education</a> and to instruct <a>performing artists</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a>Depression</a>, the <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> searched for cost savings within state government.
Towards this effort in 1931, it redefined the University of North Carolina, which at the time referred exclusively to the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, using it for the name of the entire University of North Carolina system.
The new <em>Consolidated University of North Carolina</em> was created to include the existing campuses of <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, <a>North Carolina State University</a>, and the <a>University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a>.
The three campuses came under the leadership of just one board and one president.
By 1969, three additional campuses had joined the Consolidated University through legislative action: the <a>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</a>, the <a>University of North Carolina at Asheville</a>, and the <a>University of North Carolina at Wilmington</a>.</p>
<p>In 1971, North Carolina passed legislation bringing into the University of North Carolina system all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor degrees.
This round of consolidation granted each constituent institution a <a>Chancellor</a> and a <a>Board of Trustees</a>.
In 1985, the <a>North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</a>, a residential high school for gifted students, was declared an affiliated school of the university.
In 2007, the high school became a full member of the system.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>[[Image:Pulstar2.jpg|right|thumb|[[North Carolina State University reactor program|PULSTAR Reactor]].
North Carolina State is one of several research universities in the system.]]
Article IX of the <a>North Carolina State Constitution</a> provides authorization for the creation of the University of North Carolina.
Under this authorization, Chapter 116 of the <a>North Carolina General Statutes</a> entrusts the University of North Carolina to its Board of Governors.
The Board of Governors is the policy-making body charged with &quot;the general determination, control, supervision, management, and governance of all affairs of the constituent institutions.&quot;
It elects the president, who administers the university.
The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the General Assembly for four-year terms.
The current Chairwoman of the system's Board of Governors is Hannah Gage, who was preceded by Jim W. Phillips, Jr.
The president of the Association of Student Governments is also a non-voting member.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors delegates extensive administrative authority to each constituent university.
Each institution is headed by a chancellor, who is chosen by the Board of Governors on the president's nomination and is responsible to the president.
Each institution also has a board of trustees, consisting of eight members elected by the Board of Governors, four appointed by the <a>governor</a>, and the president of the student body.
The composition of the Board of Trustees is set by statute.</p>
<h2>Legal mandate</h2>
