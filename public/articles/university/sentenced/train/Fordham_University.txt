<p><strong>Fordham University</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>not-for-profit</a> <a>research university</a> in the United States, with three main campuses located in and around New York City.
It was founded by the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of New York</a> in 1841 as <em>St.
John's College</em>, placed in the care of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> shortly thereafter, and has since become an <a>independent institution</a> under a <a>lay</a> Board of <a>Trustee</a>s which describes the university as &quot;in the <a>Jesuit</a> tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>Enrollment at Fordham University includes nearly 8,000 <a>undergraduate students</a> and 7,000 <a>graduate students</a> spread over three campuses in <a>New York State</a>: Rose Hill in <a>The Bronx</a>, Lincoln Center in <a>Manhattan</a>, and Westchester in <a>West Harrison</a>.
Today the university operates two global centers overseas, in the <a>People's Republic of China</a> and the United Kingdom.
Fordham awards <a>bachelor's</a> (<a>BA</a>, <a>BFA</a>, and <a>BS</a>), <a>master's</a>, and <a>doctoral degree</a>s.
and a BFA degree program for dance in partnership with the <a>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</a>.</p>
<p><a>Fordham Preparatory School</a>, a four-year, <a>all-male</a>, <a>college preparatory school</a>, was once integrated with the university and shares its founding.
Since legally separating from the university in 1972, &quot;Fordham Prep&quot; moved to its own facilities bordering the northwest corner of the Rose Hill Campus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1841&ndash;1900</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|350px|The original Rose Hill campus, circa 1900</a> Fordham University was originally founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the <a>Irish</a>-born <a>Coadjutor Bishop</a> (later <a>Archbishop</a>) of the Diocese of New York, the Most Reverend <a>John Joseph Hughes</a>.
The College was the first Catholic institution of <a>higher education</a> in the <a>northeastern United States</a>.
<a>Bishop</a> Hughes purchased most of Rose Hill Manor and Estate in <a>Fordham</a>, the Bronx, at a little less than $30,000 for the purpose of establishing <a>St.
Joseph's Seminary</a> in September 1840.
&quot;Rose Hill&quot; was the name originally given to the site in 1787 by its owner, <a>Robert Watts</a>, a wealthy New York merchant, in honor of his family's ancestral home in <a>Scotland</a>.
It was also in 1847 that the American poet, <a>Edgar Allan Poe</a>, arrived in the village of Fordham and began a friendship with the Jesuits that would last throughout his years there.
In 1849 he published &quot;<a>The Bells</a>&quot;, to which some traditions credit the college church bells as the inspiration.</p>
<p>In 1913 the College of St. Francis Xavier was closed, and various Fordham colleges were opened at the <a>Woolworth Building</a> in Manhattan to fill the void.
They were later moved to 302 <a>Broadway</a>.</p>
<p>The university closed its medical school in 1919.
Citing a lack of an endowment for the school and reduced general university funds due to the First World War, Fordham found itself unable to finance a high-caliber program and felt compelled to close the school rather than provide anything less.</p>
<h3>1951&ndash;2000</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|The front of the Leon Lowenstein Building at the Lincoln Center campus.</a>
In 1961, <a>Fordham Law School</a> opened at the new <a>Lincoln Center</a> campus&#x2014;the first building to open in the <a>Lincoln Square</a> Renewal Project.
In 1969, the colleges at 302 Broadway were moved to the new Lowenstein Building on the Lincoln Center campus, and other colleges soon followed.
At the Rose Hill Campus, the all-female Thomas More College began instruction in 1964.
The campus was now <a>co-ed</a>, even though classes and dorms were not.</p>
<p>In 1967 Bensalem College, an experimental college with no set curriculum or requirements and no grades, was created by university president Leo McLaughlin, S.J.
It was conceived and led by poet Elizabeth Sewell.
The college was studied by a wide array of educators and reported on by such large-circulation publications of the day as <em><a>Look</a></em>, <em><a>Esquire</a></em> and the <em><a>Saturday Review</a></em>.
The school closed in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1969, the <a>board of trustees</a> was reorganized to include a majority of non-<a>clergy</a> members, and officially made the University an independent institution.
The College of Pharmacy closed because of declining enrollment in 1972.
Fordham College at Rose Hill became <a>coeducational</a> in 1974, as a result of the <a>merger</a> with Thomas More College.</p>
<p>Since its opening in 1968, the undergraduate college in Manhattan has had its name changed from &quot;The Liberal Arts College&quot; to &quot;The College at Lincoln Center&quot; and in 1996 to &quot;Fordham College at Lincoln Center&quot;.
In 1993, a twenty-story <a>residence hall</a> was added to the campus to house 850 graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<h3>2001&ndash;present</h3>
<p><a>Marymount College</a>, an independent <a>women's college</a> founded in 1907 by the <a>Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary</a> (R.S.H.M.) was consolidated into Fordham University in July 2002.
It had been steeped in financial hardship since the 1970s.
Located  north of New York City in Tarrytown, New York, the campus remained home to a woman's undergraduate college, and added a branch of Fordham College of Liberal Studies, as well as extensions of the graduate schools of education, social service, and business administration.</p>
<p>In August 2005, the University announced a multi-year, $1 billion proposed master plan to add  of academic, student activities, and dormitory space to the Lincoln Center campus.
The development of the campus will begin with the expansion of Quinn Library and the construction of a new Law School building, a new student center, a dormitory, and additional parking.
Future phases of the development plan include the construction of new space for Fordham College of Liberal Studies, Fordham College at Lincoln Center, the <a>Graduate School of Business</a>, the Graduate School of Social Service, and the Graduate School of Education.
In 2007, responding to unforeseen objections and concerns from the <a>Upper West Side</a> community, Fordham launched a <a>&quot;neighbors&quot; site</a> designed to answer community concerns about the Lincoln Center campus expansion.
The plans for the Lincoln Center campus are part of a university-wide plan to enhance the quality of education at Fordham in an effort to become the prominent and preeminent <a>Catholic institution of higher learning in America</a>.
The first part of the strategic plan is entitled <em>Toward 2016</em>, with intent to achieve significant goals by the University's 175th Anniversary.
The University pledged to make the construction of a Law School and a science facility as the necessary first steps in that plan</p>
<p>Fordham University announced in 2005 that Marymount College would be phased out, and it awarded degrees to its final undergraduate class in May 2007.
University administration announced that the campus would remain open for Fordham graduate programs in several disciplines.
However, in the fall of 2007 the University announced its intention to seek buyers for the Marymount campus and move its programs to less expansive facilities elsewhere in Westchester.
University administration stated that the expenses required to support the programs on campus far exceeded their demand.
University officials estimate that the revenue gained from the proposed sale would not be greater than the expenses Fordham incurred maintaining and improving the campus since its merger with Marymount College.
President Father McShane nonetheless stated that the University's decision was a &quot;painful&quot; one.
Fordham then announced its intention to move the remaining programs from the Marymount campus to a new location at 400 Westchester Avenue in <a>Harrison, New York</a> by fall 2008.
On February 17, 2008, Fordham announced the sale of the campus for $27 million to <a>EF Schools</a>, a chain of private language-instruction schools.</p>
<p>In December 2007, the University established the Fordham Museum of Greek, Etruscan and Roman Art at its Rose Hill campus.
The museum contains more than 200 relics from classical antiquity, ranging from Greek terra cotta vases to Roman marble heads to Etruscan urns.
The museum was a gift from <a>William D. Walsh</a>, a 1951 graduate and founding chairman of Sequoia Associates.
The museum is located at the William D. Walsh Family Library, and is the largest collection of its kind in the <a>New York metropolitan area</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2008, Fordham entered into an affiliation with <a>Heythrop College</a>, the Jesuit specialist Philosophy and Theology College of the University of London.
Fordham will utilize a large portion of space at the college, which is located near Kensington Square, in central London.
The University of London consortium of colleges consists of such institutions as <a>King's College London</a>, <a>University College London</a>, and the <a>London School of Economics and Political Science</a>.
Fordham will host its London Dramatic Academy at Heythrop, and some College of Business Administration programs, as well.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Fordham University's academic ideals are drawn from its Jesuit influences.
The University promotes a Jesuit principle known as <em><a>cura personalis</a></em>, which fosters a faculty and administration respect for the individual student and their uniqueness, and the Jesuit principle <em><a>magis</a></em> which intends to inspire service and strive for excellence in all aspects of life, even beyond the academic.</p>
<h3>Core curriculum</h3>
<p>All undergraduate colleges at Fordham share a <a>core curriculum</a>, a distribution of offerings that consists of 17&#x2013;21 courses (depending on foreign language proficiency) drawn from nine disciplines and/or families of disciplines intended to provide a sound <a>liberal arts</a> education.
The specific class or course is not mandated, only each subject.
In outline, the core includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One course of English <a>composition / rhetoric</a> and two of <a>literature</a></li>
  <li>Two courses of <a>Philosophy</a> and two of <a>Theology</a></li>
  <li>Two courses each in <a>History</a>, <a>Social Sciences</a>, and the <a>Natural Sciences</a></li>
  <li>One course each in <a>Mathematics</a> and the <a>Fine Arts</a></li>
  <li><a>Foreign language</a> up to an advanced level (1 to 4 courses)</li>
  <li>One course each on American <a>Pluralism</a> and <a>Global Studies</a></li>
  <li>A capstone Senior Seminar in <a>Values</a> and <a>Moral</a> Choices</li>
  <li>A Freshman Seminar</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are expected to complete the core (in their home school) by the end of sophomore year, with the exception of the Global, Pluralism, and Senior Values courses.</p>
<h3>Colleges and schools</h3>

<p>Fordham University School of Law is also a Tier 1 school, ranked 30th in the nation in the 2010 <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> <a>law school rankings</a>.
The Graduate School of Social Service is similarly Tier 1 and was ranked 17th nationally in 2008 by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, and the Graduate School of Education was ranked 58th nationally.
Fordham paticipates in the BIMBA program (Beijing International MBA) &#x2014; the first foreign MBA degree to be approved by the Chinese Government and ranked #1 in China by <em><a>Fortune Magazine</a>.</em></p>
<p>While not strictly a &quot;ranking&quot;, the editors of <a>Kaplan</a>/<a>Newsweek</a>'s 2008 edition of <em>How to Get Into College Guide</em> included Fordham University as one of the &quot;25 Hottest Schools in America&quot;, with the title &quot;Hottest Catholic School.&quot;
In 1962, <a>Time Magazine</a> similarly recognized Fordham University as a &quot;<a>Jesuit Ivy</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>Fordham University attracts students from around the world, and at the turn of the 21st century had registered students from approximately 90 countries in addition to every US state and territory.
To accommodate this student body, the university has two residential campuses: Rose Hill in the Bronx and Lincoln Center in Manhattan.
The University also maintains programs at the Westchester campus in <a>West Harrison</a>, a biological field station in <a>Armonk, New York</a>, and participates in cosortia at two international locations: <a>The Beijing International MBA (BIMBA)</a> in Beijing, China, and the Fordham University London Centre in the United Kingdom, home to the London Drama Academy.</p>
<p>The undergraduate Fordham College of Liberal Studies holds classes on all three New York campuses, utilizing the same faculty and curriculum as the other colleges in the University.
In addition, the flexibility of multiple campuses facilitates options for both full-time and part-time study and unconventional scheduling, in order to accommodate students who are employed full-time or otherwise unable to take advantage of the offerings at Fordham's other, more centralized, undergraduate colleges.</p>
<p>Fordham is among the largest of the 28 member institutions in the <a>Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities</a>, and is home to a large Jesuit community of the New York Province.</p>
<h3>Rose Hill</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|The Southern Boulevard entrance to the Rose Hill campus.</a>The
Rose Hill campus, established in 1841, is home to the undergraduate Fordham College at Rose Hill, the Gabelli School of Business, and a portion of the Fordham College of Liberal Studies as well as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Graduate School of Religion &amp; Religious Education.
Located on  in the north Bronx, it is among the largest &quot;open space campuses&quot; in New York City.
The campus is bordered by the <a>New York Botanical Garden</a>, the <a>Bronx Zoo</a>, and &quot;Little Italy of the Bronx&quot; on <a>Arthur Avenue</a>.
Rose Hill's traditional collegiate <a>Gothic architecture</a>, <a>cobblestone</a> streets, and green expanses of lawn have been used as settings in a number of feature films over the years.</p>
<p>Rose Hill is also home to the University Church, which was built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for surrounding farms.
The gothic-style church is an official New York City landmark and contains the original altar from <a>Old St. Patrick's Cathedral</a>, along with <a>stained glass</a> windows that did not fit the cathedral given by <a>Louis-Philippe of France</a> to Archbishop Hughes.
The windows are also notable for their connection to a workshop in <a>S&#x00e8;vres</a>, France that is associated with the earliest stages of the <a>Gothic Revival</a>.
Among the 15 campus dormitories are Fordham's three <a>residential colleges</a>: <a>O'Hare Hall</a>, <a>Tierney Hall</a>, and <a>Queen's Court</a> (the last, with its notable Bishop's Lounge, dates back to the days of St. John's College).
Finlay Hall, now an upperclassman dormitory, was built in 1905 as home to the (since defunct) medical school,and later was home to the chemistry department for 47 years, until 1968.
Walsh Hall dormitory confusingly faces the street on the boundary instead of the interior of the campus as a condition of a loan Fordham received from New York City.
Had Fordham defaulted on the loan, the city would have converted it into a <a>housing project</a> that required on-street access.</p>
<p>The campus is served by the <a>Fordham station</a> of the <a>Metro-North Railroad</a> (the tracks run along the boundary fence), with a southern terminus at <a>Grand Central Terminal</a> in Manhattan.
Public transit buses stop adjacent to campus exits and <a>New York City Subway</a> stations are within walking distance.
The University also provides a &quot;Ram Van&quot; shuttle service among the three main campuses.
About 6,284 undergraduates and graduates attend the Rose Hill campus, with 3,143 in residence.</p>
<h3>Lincoln Center</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|<em>Peter, Fisher of Men</em> statue at the Lincoln Center campus.</a>
The Lincoln Center campus, the space allocated by <a>Robert Moses</a> in 1961 as part of the &quot;Lincoln Square Renewal Project&quot;, &lt;includeonly&gt;This is NOT the same as Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, though both the campus and the performing arts center were both part of the renewal project.&lt;/includeonly&gt; is home to the undergraduate Fordham College at Lincoln Center and a portion of Fordham College of Liberal Studies, as well as the <a>School of Law</a>, the <a>Graduate School of Business Administration</a>, the Graduate School of Education, and the Graduate School of Social Service.
The  campus occupies the area from West 60th Street to West 62nd Street between <a>Columbus</a> and <a>Amsterdam</a> Avenues, in the cultural heart of Manhattan.
Across the street is one of the world's great cultural centers, <a>Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a>; nearby are <a>Central Park</a>, <a>Carnegie Hall</a>, <a>Rockefeller Center</a> and <a>Radio City Music Hall</a>, <a>Tiffany &amp; Co.</a>, <a>Lord &amp; Taylor</a>, <a>F.A.O.
Schwartz</a> and other famous <a>Fifth Avenue</a> retailers, <a>Broadway</a>, and <a>Columbus Circle</a>.
The campus is served by public transit bus stops at the campus entrances, and by the New York City Subway at <a>59th Street&#x2013;Columbus Circle</a> station.
The University also provides a &quot;Ram Van&quot; shuttle service among its three campuses.</p>
<p>About 8,000 undergraduate, graduate, professional, and doctoral students study at the Lincoln Center campus, where about 940 live in apartment-style housing.
There are almost 1,800 undergraduates enrolled in Fordham College At Lincoln Center, with an additional 300 undergraduates in the Fordham College of Liberal Studies (at this campus), and the remainder comprise the graduate population.</p>
<h3>Westchester</h3>
<p>The University moved extensions of the Fordham College of Liberal Studies (Westchester Division) and the graduate schools of Business Administration, Education, Social Service, and Religion and Religious Education from the former Marymount campus to 400 Westchester Avenue in <a>West Harrison</a>, New York.
The first classes were held in the fall, 2008.</p>
<p>The campus includes a three-story,  building on  landscaped with a stream and pond.
Fordham signed a 20-year lease for the new campus.
The facilities include 26 newly designed classrooms featuring technological amenities such as &quot;smart boards&quot;, <a>teleconferencing</a> capabilities, and newly installed seating and learning areas.</p>
<p>In addition, faculty offices and administrative support space, a library resource center, a food service facility, and meeting areas both indoor and outdoor for student sessions are available.
Over $8 million was spent in renovation to provide the University with <a>green building</a> technology, including the design of academic facilities surrounding a large central courtyard.</p>
<p>This campus is served by the <a>White Plains station</a> of the <a>Metro-North Railroad</a>, approximately  away in the <a>county seat</a> of <a>White Plains</a>, with a southern terminus at <a>Grand Central Station</a> in Manhattan.
The White Plains station and the campus are both served by the Westchester County Bus System (&quot;<a>The Bee-Line</a>&quot;).
In addition, the University offers a &quot;Ram-Van&quot; shuttle among the three campuses.
<a>Westchester County Airport</a> is the closest to this campus, at a drive of approximately .</p>
<h3>Louis Calder Center</h3>
<p>The <a>Louis Calder Center</a> is Fordham's biological field station for ecological research and environmental education.
Located  north of New York City in <a>Armonk</a>, New York, the station consists of  forested with a  lake and 19 buildings, which are used for laboratory and office space, educational programs, equipment storage, and residences.
The station's state-of-the-art equipment, research library, greenhouses, and housing are available for research and educational programs for students, faculty, and visiting scientists.</p>
<h3>Beijing, People's Republic of China</h3>
<p>The <em>Beijing International <a>MBA</a> Program</em> (BiMBA) was a <a>joint venture</a> between a consortium of <a>Jesuit</a> Colleges and Universities in the United States and <a>Peking University</a>.
Fordham University granted the degrees and managed its programs with the <a>China Center for Economic Research</a> (CCER).
<a>Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School</a> in Belgium has been the degree granting institution for BiMBA since 2008, though Fordham maintains a relationship.
BiMBA was founded in 1998 and is located on the campus of Peking University in <a>Beijing</a>, People's Republic of China.
BiMBA enrolls over 400 students a year in traditional part-time and full-time MBA programs, and in Executive MBA (EMBA) programs.
It offers the first foreign MBA degree to be approved by the Chinese government, and was ranked number 1 in China by <a>Fortune Magazine</a>.</p>
<h3>London Center (Centre), United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Since the spring of 2009 Fordham has affiliated with <a>Heythrop College</a>, the Jesuit specialist Philosophy and Theology College of the University of London.
This created a base in the city's <a>Kensington Square</a> for Fordham's programs, which include the London Dramatic Academy, as well as a spring semester and two summer College of Business Administration programs.</p>

<h2>Fordham traditions</h2>
<h3>Fordham <em>Maroon</em></h3>
<p><a>Magenta</a> was Fordham's original color, but <a>Harvard</a> used the same color.
A series of baseball games between the two was to determine the right to use it.
Harvard, despite having lost the competition, continued to use the color.
Therefore, Fordham eventually changed its official color to <a>maroon</a>.</p>
<h3>The Ram</h3>
<p>The <a>ram</a> evolved into Fordham's mascot and symbol from a slightly vulgar cheer that Fordham fans sang during an 1893 football game against the <a>United States Military Academy</a> at West Point.
The students began cheering &quot;One-damn, two-damn, three-damn...Fordham!&quot;
The song was an instant hit, but &quot;<a>damn</a>&quot; was later sanitized to &quot;ram&quot; to conform to the university's image.</p>
<h3>The Victory Bell</h3>
<p>The &quot;Victory Bell&quot;, which is mounted outside the Rose Hill Gym, is from the <a>Japanese aircraft carrier Juny&#x014d;</a>.
According to the plaque below the bell, it was recovered near <a>Saipan</a> where it was &quot;silenced by an aerial Bomb.&quot;
It was given to Fordham as a gift by Admiral <a>Chester W. Nimitz</a> &quot;as a Memorial to Our Dear Young Dead of World War II.&quot;
It was blessed by <a>Cardinal Spellman</a>, and &quot;was first rung at Fordham by the President of the United States, the Honorable <a>Harry S. Truman</a> on May 11, 1946, the Charter Centenary of the University.&quot;
It is rung by each Fordham senior player after victorious home football games and its ringing also marks the start of the commencement ceremonies each May.
A small group of students rang the bell on the 50th anniversary of <a>Pearl Harbor</a> in honor of the war dead.</p>
<h3>The Rose Hill Gymnasium</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|The Rose Hill Gym</a></p>
<p>The men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the volleyball squad, play in the <a>Rose Hill Gym</a>nasium, the oldest gym still in use at the NCAA Division I level.</p>
<h3>The Great Seal</h3>
<p>The Great Seal of Fordham University bears the Society of Jesus <a>coat of arms</a> at the center.
The shield bears the Greek letters of the name &quot;<a>Jesus</a>&quot;, <em><a>IHS</a></em>, with the cross resting in the horizontal line of the letter &quot;H&quot;, three nails beneath (evoking those used in the <a>crucifixion</a> of Jesus), all in gold in a field framed in maroon, the color of the University, with silver <a>fleurs-de-lis</a> (reminiscent of the French origin of the first Jesuit instructors) on the edge of the maroon frame.
Beneath the shield, a <a>scroll</a> with the University's motto in <a>latin</a>, <em>Sapienta et Doctrina</em> (Wisdom and Learning), is etched.
The scroll rests on a field in which tongues of fire are displayed, recalling the outpouring of the <a>Holy Spirit</a> of Wisdom that marked the first <a>Pentecost</a>.
A upright <a>laurel</a> above the shield has within engraved the names of the disciplines that were taught when the school was granted university status in 1907: [liberal] arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law.
Surrounding the entire seal is a <a>heraldic</a> belt, which has engraved the name of the school in Latin, <em>Universitas Fordhamensis</em>, and year of founding.</p>
<h3>Festival of Lessons and Carols</h3>
<p>The University annually presents a concert of <a>Lessons and Carols</a> during the <a>Christmas</a> holiday season.
The ensemble university choir presents one evening concert at the large and dramatic Church of Saint Paul the Apostle adjacent to the Lincoln Center Campus, and one afternoon concert at the more humble and intimate University Church at the Rose Hill Campus, each year.</p>
<h3>William Spain Seismic Observatory</h3>
<p>Since 1910, when the Rev. Edward P. Tivnan, SJ, installed a <a>seismograph</a> in the basement of the administration building at the Rose Hill Campus, Fordham has been the site of the oldest seismic station in New York City.
<a>William Spain Seismic Observatory</a> has since measured much of the world's natural and unnatural trembling, including <a>earthquakes</a>, China's first <a>atomic explosion</a> in 1964, and local <a>subway trains</a>.</p>
<p>The station opened in 1924 and sits at the edge of Edward's Parade in the center of the campus, next to Freeman Hall, home of the department of physics.
It is named in honor of a physics student who died in 1922 and whose father donated the funds to build the station.</p>
<h3>Encaenia</h3>
<p>Fordham College at Rose Hill annually stages an <a>Encaenia</a> on an evening near the conclusion of the academic year.
Faculty, administrators, and students process in <a>academic regalia</a> to a ceremony where candidates for degrees at the current year's commencement are presented awards and honors.
The ceremony includes a sentimental speech by the college's <a>valedictorian</a>, as well as the traditionally more humorous yet equally endearing speech by the honorary &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady of the Manor&quot; selected for the evening.</p>
<h3>Songs</h3>
<p>Fordham's school song is &quot;Alma Mater Fordham&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;The Marching Song&quot; is typically played during parades and after athletic games (particularly after a Fordham victory).
There is another song named &quot;The Maroon&quot; but the sheet music for this has been lost.</p>
