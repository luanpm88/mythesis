<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:MaryLyon Portrait.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Mary
Lyon]]]] <a>thumb|100px|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1837</a> <a>thumb|right|100px|Mount Holyoke in 1887</a></p>
<p>Mount Holyoke's founder, <a>Mary Lyon</a>, is considered by many scholars to be an educational innovator in the area of women's education.
Her establishment of <em>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary</em> was part of a larger movement to create institutions of higher education for young women during the early half of the 19th century.
Lyon's contemporaries include  <a>Sarah Pierce</a> (<a>Litchfield Female Academy</a>, 1792);  <a>Catharine Beecher</a> (<a>Hartford Female Seminary</a>, 1823); <a>Zilpah P. Grant Banister</a> (<a>Ipswich Female Seminary</a>, 1828).
Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary.
She was also involved in the creation of <em>Wheaton Female Seminary</em> (now <a>Wheaton College, Massachusetts</a>) in 1834.<em>Mount
Holyoke Female Seminary</em> was originally chartered as a <a>teaching seminary</a> in 1836 and opened its doors to students on 8 November 1837.
Both <a>Vassar College</a> and <a>Wellesley College</a> were patterned after Mount Holyoke.</p>
<p>From its founding in 1837, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary &quot;had no religious affiliation&quot;.
However, &quot;students were required to attend church services, chapel talks, prayer meetings, and Bible study groups.
Twice a day teachers and students spent time in private devotions.
Every dorm room had two large lighted closets to give roommates privacy during their devotions&quot;.
Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was the sister school to <a>Andover Seminary</a>.
Some Andover graduates looked to marry students from the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before becoming missionaries because the <a>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions</a> (ABCFM) required its missionaries to be married before starting their missions.
By 1859, there were more than 60 missionary alumnae; by 1887, the school's alumnae comprised one fifth of all female American missionaries for the ABCFM; and by the end of the century, 248 of its alumnae had entered the mission field.</p>
<p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary received its collegiate charter in 1888, becoming Mount Holyoke Seminary and College.
In 1893, it became Mount Holyoke College.
Mount Holyoke's chapter of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> was established in 1905.
It has been a sister school to <a>Women's Christian College</a> in <a>Chennai</a>, <a>Tamil Nadu</a>, <a>India</a> since 1920.
In the early 1970s, Mount Holyoke had a long debate under the presidency of <a>David Truman</a> over the issue of coeducation.
On 6 November 1971, the board of trustees voted to remain a women's college.
</p>
<p>On February 28, 1987, the <a>United States Postal Service</a>'s <a>Great Americans Series</a> issued a <a>postage stamp</a> featuring Mary Lyon in honor of Mount Holyoke's <em>Sesquicentennial</em> (Mount Holyoke's 150th anniversary).</p>
