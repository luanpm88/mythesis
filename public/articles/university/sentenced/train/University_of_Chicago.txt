<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Founding&#x2013;1910s</h3>
<p>The University of Chicago was created and <a>incorporated</a> as a <a>coeducational</a>, secular institution in 1890 by the <a>American Baptist Education Society</a> and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>.
It emerged from a <a>Baptist university of the same name</a> that had closed in 1886 due to financial difficulties.
<a>William Rainey Harper</a> became the modern University's first president on July 1, 1891, and the first classes were held on October 1, 1892.</p>
<p>The <a>business school</a> was founded in 1898, and the <a>law school</a> was founded in 1902.
Harper died in 1906, and was replaced by a series of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.
During this period, the <a>Oriental Institute</a> was founded.</p>
<h3>1920s&#x2013;1980s</h3>
<p>In 1929, the University's fifth president, <a>Robert Maynard Hutchins</a>, took office; the University underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure.
Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the University in an attempt to deemphasize athletics over academics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the <a>Common Core</a>, During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students, and the <a>Committee on Social Thought</a> was created.</p>
<p>[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|left|thumb|350px|The University of Chicago team that worked on the production of the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction, including [[Enrico Fermi]] in the front row|alt=A group of people in suits standing in three rows on the steps in front of a stone building.]]
Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> helped the school to survive through the <a>Great Depression</a>.
The University was the site of the first isolation of <a>plutonium</a> and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by <a>Enrico Fermi</a> in 1942.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
In response, the University became a major sponsor of a controversial <a>urban renewal</a> project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.
For details of this urban renewal effort, see <a>Hyde Park</a>.</p>
<p>The University experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the University's off-campus rental policies.
In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, <a>Marlene Dixon</a>, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks.
After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.</p>
<p>In 1978, <a>Hanna Holborn Gray</a>, then the provost and acting president of <a>Yale University</a>, became President of the University of Chicago, in which capacity she served for 15 years.</p>
<p><a>thumb|300px|View from the Midway Plaisance</a></p>
<h3>1990s&#x2013;2000s</h3>
<p>In 1999, then-President <a>Hugo Sonnenschein</a> announced plans to relax the University's famed <a>core curriculum</a>, reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15.
When <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>The Economist</a></em>, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the University became the focal point of a national debate on education.
The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.</p>
<p>In the past decade, the University began a number of multi-million dollar expansion projects.
In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the <a>Milton Friedman Institute</a>.
The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the <a>Chicago Theological Seminary</a>.
Some faculty members and students have signed petition against these plans.
During the same year, investor <a>David G. Booth</a> donated $300&nbsp;million to the University's <a>Graduate School of Business</a>, which is the largest gift in the University's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.
In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.</p>
<p>A recent two billion dollar campaign has brought substantial expansion to the campus, including the unveiling of the <a>Max Palevsky Residential Commons</a>, the South Campus Residence Hall, the <a>Gerald Ratner Athletics Center</a>, a new hospital, and a new science building.
Current construction projects include: the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, as well as further additions to the medical campus of the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>.</p>

older buildings of the University of Chicago employ [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture like that of the <a>University of Oxford</a>.
For example, Chicago's Mitchell Tower (left) was modeled after Oxford's <a>Magdalen Tower</a> (right).]]</p>
<p>The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of  in the Chicago neighborhoods of <a>Hyde Park</a> and <a>Woodlawn</a>, seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of <a>downtown Chicago</a>.
The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the <a>Midway Plaisance</a>, a large, linear park created for the 1893 <a>World's Columbian Exposition</a>.</p>
<p>The first buildings of the University of Chicago campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a &quot;master plan&quot; conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect <a>Henry Ives Cobb</a>.
The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, <a>Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge</a>, <a>Holabird &amp; Roche</a>, and other architectural firms in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style, deliberately patterned after the layouts of the <a>Universities of Oxford</a>.
(Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's <a>Magdalen Tower</a>, and the University Commons, <a>Hutchinson Hall</a>, is a duplicate of Oxford's <a>Christ Church</a> Hall.)</p>
<p>After the 1940s, the Collegiate Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles.
Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the <a>Gerald Ratner Athletics Center</a> (2003), and other constructions, expansions, and restorations.</p>
<p>The site of <a>Chicago Pile-1</a> is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and is marked by the <a>Henry Moore</a> sculpture <em><a>Nuclear Energy</a></em>.
<a>Robie House</a>, a <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a> building acquired by the University in 1963, is also a National Historic Landmark, as is room 405 of the <a>George Herbert Jones Laboratory</a>, where <a>Glenn T. Seaborg</a> and his team were the first to isolate plutonium.
<a>Hitchcock Hall</a>, an undergraduate dormitory, is on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; <img></p>
<h3>Satellite campuses</h3>
<p>The University of Chicago also maintains facilities apart from its main campus.
The University's <a>Booth School of Business</a> maintains campuses in <a>Singapore</a>, <a>London</a>, and the downtown <a>Streeterville</a> neighborhood of Chicago.
The Center in Paris, a campus located on the <a>left bank</a> of the <a>Seine</a> in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.
The University of Chicago also opened a new center in Beijing in fall 2010.</p>
