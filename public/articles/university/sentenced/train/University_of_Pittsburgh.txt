The <strong>University of Pittsburgh</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Pitt</strong>, is a <a>state-related</a> research <a>university</a> located in <a>Pittsburgh</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>United States</a>.
Founded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States.
Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the <a>Oakland</a> neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh.
For most of its history Pitt was a private institution, until it became part of the <a>Commonwealth System of Higher Education</a> in 1966.</p>
<p>Pitt has been placed in the top cluster of 7 leading U.S. public research universities and among the clusters comprising the overall top 25 research universities, is ranked among <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a><strong>s top public universities, has been placed among the best for the quality of life of its students, has been named as a &quot;best value&quot; by various publications, and has appeared in multiple rankings of the world's top universities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Pitt is among the nation's and world's most active research institutions as evidenced by its $642 million in annual research expenditures, its standing among the top five schools in the amount of <a>National Institutes of Health</a> research allocations, and its election as one of the 63 North American members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.
Pitt and its <a>medical school</a> are also closely affiliated with the <a>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</a>, one of the nation's leading academic medical centers.</p>
<p>Pitt is popularly recognized for its centerpiece building, the <a>Cathedral of Learning</a>, for its central role in developing the first polio vaccine, and for fielding nationally competitive <a>NCAA Division I</a> <a>athletic programs</a>.</p>
<h2>History of the University</h2>
<p>[[Image:brackenridge.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], founder of Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, was a fiery revolutionary, an early supporter of the <a>U.S. Constitution</a>, and is considered America's first novelist.]]
</p>
<h3>The founding</h3>
<p>Founded by <a>Hugh Henry Brackenridge</a> as <strong>Pittsburgh Academy</strong> in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is among a select group of universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the <a>United States</a>.
It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S., west of the <a>Allegheny Mountains</a>.
The school began its life as a preparatory school, presumably in a <a>log cabin</a>, possibly as early as 1770 in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.
Hugh Henry Brackenridge sought and obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the <a>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> that was passed by the assembly on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the <a>Constitutional Convention</a> in Philadelphia.
A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.
The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.</p>
<h3>The Western University</h3>
<p>Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the <a>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status.
The school took the name the <strong>Western University of Pennsylvania</strong>, or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> in <a>Philadelphia</a>.
By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown <a>Pittsburgh</a>.
By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional  liberal education in favor of the <a>state legislature's</a> desire for it to provide more vocational training.
The decision to  remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.
It was also during this era that founder of <a>Mellon Bank</a>, <a>Thomas Mellon</a> (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.
In 1895, WUP established its School of Law and <a>Andrew Carnegie</a> and <a>George Westinghouse</a> were elected to the Board of Trustees, where they joined <a>Andrew Mellon</a> who was elected in 1894.
The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the University in 1896.
In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the University.
During this period, University engineering professor <a>Reginald Fessenden</a> was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting.
By 1904, playing at <a>Exposition Park</a>, the University had its first undefeated football team.</p>
<h3>A new name and home</h3>
<p>[[File:Thaw1913.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thaw
Hall]], circa 1910]] Citing a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the <strong>University of Pittsburgh</strong> in the summer of 1908.
During this time, the University had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years.
To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought  of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.
The initial campus plan for the University centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by <a>Henry Hornbostel</a> for 30 buildings.
However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only <a>Thaw Hall</a> remains today.
It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor <a>Samuel McCormick</a>,  would again fend off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training.
During his administration, McCormick would also lead the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as began institutional support of  athletics.</p>
<h3>A national landmark</h3>
<p>[[File:1935CathedralofLearningOwl.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The
[[Cathedral of Learning]] circa 1935]] In the 1920s, new university chancellor <a>John Gabbert Bowman</a> declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece &quot;tall building&quot; for the university.
The  Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-<a>Gothic Revival</a> plan that today comprises the <a>Cathedral of Learning</a>, <a>Heinz Memorial Chapel</a>, <a>Stephen Foster Memorial</a>, and <a>Clapp Hall</a> buildings.
By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by <a>Charles Klauder</a> for the &quot;tall building&quot;: an attention-getting  tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the &quot;character that ought to be in an educated man.&quot;
The building's &quot;parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness&quot; and it would &quot;unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.&quot;
The Cathedral is &quot;cut off&quot; flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending.
The building was financed by donors as well as a campaign to collect dimes from local school children.
Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the <a>Great Depression</a> intervened, the <a>Cathedral of Learning</a>, on which construction was begun in 1926, started hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937.
Today, it remains the second-tallest education building in the world and contains an equally-impressive interior highlighted by a half-acre (2,000 m&#x00b2;) Gothic hall Commons Room with  tall arches surrounded by 27&nbsp;<a>Nationality Rooms</a>.</p>
<h3>Development of the polio vaccine</h3>
<p>[[Image:SalkatPitt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jonas
Salk]] developed the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh.]]
In the early 20th century, epidemics of <a>polio</a> began to hit the <a>United States</a> and other industrialized countries.
As hospital wards filled with patients in <a>iron lung</a>s, and tens of thousands were left crippled, fear of contracting polio grew rampant and led to the closing of many public facilities.
Meanwhile, <a>Dr.
Jonas Salk</a> had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now <a>Salk Hall</a>.
By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus.
Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated.
By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the <a>vaccine</a> developed by <a>Jonas Salk</a> and his team of Pitt researchers was declared effective.
By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by <em>95 percent</em>.
The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.</p>
<h3>State relations</h3>
<p>In 1966, Pitt was designated by <a>Pennsylvania</a> as a <a>state-related</a> university.
As such, Pitt receives public funds (currently more than $200 million per annum) and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents.
Pitt remains under independent control, but is typically categorized as a public university.
Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope.
In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by <a>Hall of Fame</a> running back <a>Tony Dorsett</a> and continued success in the 1980s with players such as <a>Hall of Fame</a> quarterback <a>Dan Marino</a>.
In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of <a>organ transplantation</a> was conducted by <a>Thomas Starzl</a>, establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation.
In 1991, long-time chancellor <a>Wesley Posvar</a> retired after 24 years in office.
His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment.
Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million.
<a>Mark Nordenberg</a> has been chancellor of the University since 1995 and is leading Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over half-way toward achieving its goal and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.
In 2009, Pitt's $1.837 billion endowment ranked 27th among all colleges and universities and 7th nationally among public universities.
Pitt's endowment now stands at $2.05 billion.</p>
<h2>Location and campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:HeinzChapelSouth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heinz
Memorial Chapel]]]] The University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) located in Pittsburgh's historic <a>Oakland</a> neighborhood.
Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story <a>Cathedral of Learning</a>, falls within the <a>Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District</a>.
The campus contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern.
It has been termed &quot;a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.&quot;
The campus has won multiple Green Star Awards from the <a>Professional Grounds Management Society</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh's main campus can be thought to be made up of four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, <a>residence halls</a>); mid (<a>Benedum</a>, <a>Chevron</a>, <a>Allen</a> and <a>Thaw Hall</a>s); lower (<a>Cathedral of Learning</a>, <a>Union</a>, <a>Posvar Hall</a>); and on the west end of campus, the <a>medical center complex</a>.
The campus is generally bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east.
Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a <a>bus and shuttle service</a> between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The main campus abuts or is within a short walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions that also populate the Oakland neighborhood.
The campus is directly adjacent to <a>Schenley Plaza</a>, the main branch of the <a>Carnegie Public Library</a>, the <a>Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art</a>, and the Carnegie Music Hall.
<a>Carlow University</a> is just west of campus, adjacent to the University's medical center complexes.
<a>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, <a>Central Catholic High School</a> and historic <a>Schenley Park</a>, site of the <a>Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens</a>, lie across <a>Junction Hollow</a> on the east end.
Some Pitt professors also hold adjunct professorships at Carnegie Mellon and <em>vice-versa</em>. <img></p>
<h3>Historic buildings</h3>
<p>[[Image:StephenFosterWinter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stephen

<h3>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</h3>
<p>  [[Image:WPUlawn.jpg|thumb|right|[[William
Pitt Union]] and the <a>Millennium Panther</a>]]</p>
<p>The <a>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</a> (UPMC), which is consistently ranked in U.S. News &amp; World Report's &quot;Honor Roll&quot; of America's top hospitals, consists of the following hospitals and facilities in the <a>Oakland</a> area, many of which have shared use with various university departments: UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, UPMC Montefiore Hospital, Magee-Women's Hospital of UPMC, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Thomas Detre Hall, Eye and Ear Institute, <a>Forbes Tower</a> (home to the <a>School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences</a>), Iroquois Building, Kaufman Medical Building, Medical Arts Building, 230 McKee Place, and UPMC University Center.
UPMC academic hospitals and facilities that are scattered elsewhere throughout the city include the <a>Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC</a> campus in the <a>Lawrencevville</a> neighborhood, the <a>UPMC Sports Performance Complex</a> on the <a>South Side</a>, and UPMC Shadyside and the <a>University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute</a> in the Hillman Cancer Center both located in the <a>Shadyside</a> neighborhood adjacent to Oakland.</p>
<h3>Panthers</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the fall of 1909, the University of Pittsburgh was the first college or university to adopt the panther (<em><a>Puma concolor</a></em>) as its mascot.
Popular as photo sites, there are ten representations of Panthers in and about Pitt's campus, and ten more painted fiberglass panthers placed around the campus by the Pitt Student Government.
These fiberglass panther structures are given to a campus group for a year and painted by the group to reflect their interests.
The oldest representations are four panthers that guard each corner of the Panther Hollow bridge.
Other Oakland locations include both inside and in front of the William Pitt Union, outside the Petersen Events Center, &quot;Pitt the Panther&quot; on the carousel in Schenley Plaza, the Panther head fountain on the front of the Cathedral of Learning, and the Pitt Panther statue outside Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>[[File:Cathedral of Learning inside entrance.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cathedral of Learning#Commons Room|Commons Room]] in the Cathedral of Learning]] Throughout its history, Pitt has been committed to a liberal arts education with a well-rounded curriculum in the arts, sciences, and humanities.
Undergraduate degrees can be earned as Bachelor's of Arts, Bachelor's of Science, and Bachelor's of Philosophy.
Along with providing certificate programs, graduate level masters, professional, and doctoral degrees are also awarded.
Pitt has also initiated a University-wide Outside the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) that includes a structured series of extracurricular programs and experiences designed to complement students' academic studies and help develop personal attributes and professional skills.
Students who complete the OCC requirements receive an OCC &quot;transcript&quot; and a green cord of distinction to wear at commencement.</p>
<h3>Schools</h3>
<p>Bachelor's, master's, doctoral and professional programs are offered through the following academic units: </p>
<h3>International studies</h3>
<p>[[Image:Indianroom2.jpg|thumb|right|The Indian Classroom, one of 27 [[Nationality Rooms]] in the Cathedral of Learning]] Pitt&#x2019;s history of commitment to international education is illustrated by its unique collection of 27 <a>Nationality Rooms</a> on the first and third floors of the <a>Cathedral of Learning</a>.
As a further demonstration of this commitment, Pitt is one of the country&#x2019;s leading producers of both Fulbright scholars and Peace Corps volunteers and one of less than 20 American universities to claim five or more area studies programs that have been competitively designated as National Resource Centers by the <a>U.S.
Department of Education</a>.</p>
<p>Pitt's National Resource Centers include Asian,  European, Latin American, Russian and East European, and Global studies, as well as Pitt's International Business Center.
Further, Pitt is home to one of just ten European Union Centers of Excellence in the U.S., funded by the <a>European Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>University Center for International Studies</a> (UCIS) coordinates international education curricula, centers on topical specializations in international studies, and the centers for area studies, including the National Resource Centers, among existing faculty and departments throughout the university.
It does not itself give degrees but awards certificates of attainment to degree candidates in the University's schools and also operates certificate programs in African Studies (undergraduate) and in Global Studies (undergraduate &amp; graduate).
UCIS also operates the Study Abroad Office, Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs.</p>
<p>Pitt's study abroad program, under the auspices of UCIS, helps to facilitate student study in over a hundred different countries, and include a variety of programs including the Panther Programs, which are course taught abroad that have been developed and are accompanied by faculty of the university; two-way exchange agreements with foreign institutions; and Pitt-recognized, third-party exchange programs.
The university also offers several study abroad scholarships, including those through the Nationality Rooms program.
In addition, following the decision to end a 24-year sponsorship of the <a>Semester at Sea</a> program due to academic, administrative and safety concerns,  Pitt has created a Multi-region Academic Program (PittMAP) that involves international travel, accompanied by university faculty, to three different continents for the comparative study of one of six rotating global study themes.</p>
