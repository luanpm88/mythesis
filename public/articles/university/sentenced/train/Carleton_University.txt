<p><strong>Carleton University</strong> is a comprehensive <a>university</a> located in Canada's capital of <a>Ottawa</a>, <a>Ontario</a>.
The enabling legislation is <em>The Carleton University Act, 1952, S.O.
1952.</em>
The university has been consistently ranked among the top 10 comprehensive universities in Canada.
Founded as a small <a>college</a> in 1942, Carleton now offers over 65 programs in a diverse range of disciplines, including public affairs, <a>journalism</a>, film studies, engineering, business/commerce, high technology, and international studies.
More than 2000 faculty members instruct some 23,000 students drawn from over 147 countries, studying for a Bachelor's, Master's or Doctoral degree.
The University is named after <a>Carleton County, Ontario</a>, which included the city of Ottawa at the time Carleton was founded.
Carleton County, in turn, was named in honour of <a>Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester</a>, an early Governor-General of <a>British North America</a>.</p>
<p>Past chancellors include two <a>Nobel</a> laureates; pioneering scientist <a>Gerhard Herzberg</a> and <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Lester B. Pearson</a>, as well as six <a>Order of Canada</a> recipients.
The Right Honourable <a>Herb Gray</a>, Canada's longest-serving continuous Member of Parliament, former Cabinet minister in the Trudeau, Turner, and Chretien governments, former Deputy Prime Minister, and acting Leader of the Opposition, is the current Chancellor of the University.
Dr. <a>Roseann Runte</a> was appointed the university's president on January 8, 2008, succeeding <a>David W. Atkinson</a> and his <em>pro tempore</em> (acting) successor <a>Samy Mahmoud</a>, the previous Vice-President (academic).
In 2010, the Times World University Rankings placed Carleton in the 201st position (tying with the University of Maryland) as well as the 10th position in Canada.
[<a>http://www2.carleton.ca/newsroom/info-brief/carleton-places-10th-in-canada-in-times-world-university-rankings/</a>]
These rankings are significant because other high profile institutions within Canada such as Queen's, Waterloo, UWO, Calgary, and Ottawa U did not make the top 10.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I learned very early the life lesson that it is people, not buildings, that make up an institution.
And if we put our hearts to it we can do something worthwhile.
-- <em>Henry Marshall Tory</em></p>

<p>[[Image:Carleton pres Tory.jpg|thumb|150px |[[Henry Marshall Tory]], first President of Carleton College]]</p>
<p>Carleton College, a non-denominational college was founded in 1942 at the height of the <a>Second World War</a> by the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning.
It was originally located in a rented building and only offered night courses in public administration and introductory university subjects.
When the war ended in 1945, the College began expanding to meet the needs of veterans coming home.
The Faculty of Arts and Science was established, which included courses in <a>journalism</a> and first-year engineering.</p>
<p>In 1946 the college moved to <a>The Glebe</a> neighbourhood along First Avenue at the former Ottawa Ladies' College.
Its first degrees were conferred in 1946 to graduates of its programs in Journalism and Public Administration.
In the same year, the 62 hectare property nestled between the <a>Rideau Canal</a> and the <a>Rideau River</a> on which the current campus is located was acquired.
Some of the land was donated by a prominent Ottawa businessman <a>Harry Stevenson Southam</a>.
Construction began on the new campus in 1953.</p>
<p>Carleton was granted a university charter in 1957.
In 1957 the <a><em>Carleton University Act</em>, 1952</a> was amended, officially granting Carleton status as a university and thus changing its name to Carleton University.
Carleton's motto, &quot;Ours the Task Eternal,&quot; is taken from <a>Walt Whitman</a>'s poem, <em><a>Pioneers!
O Pioneers!</a></em>.</p>
<p>The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Faculty of Public Affairs</h3>
<p>[[Image:Pearson-Carleton.jpg|thumb|135px |right|[[Lester B. Pearson]], Carleton's <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> winning Chancellor from 1969 until his death in 1972]] The University's Faculty of Public Affairs offers a number programs.
Indeed, Carleton's first degrees were awarded in Journalism and Public Administration.
Carleton's <a>Norman Paterson School of International Affairs</a> (NPSIA) offers Canada's only graduate programs in the field &#x2014;an MA, a combined MA and LLB (offered in conjunction with the <a>University of Ottawa Law School</a>), and a PhD in International Affairs.
In a survey of 110 Canadian foreign affairs scholars published in <a>Foreign Policy</a>, Carleton's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs ranked 1st in Canada and 2nd in North America in schools offering Masters degrees in International Relations.
Carleton has a long standing tradition of conferring an honorary doctorate on each of the Secretaries General of the <a>United Nations</a>, beginning with <a>Dag Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld</a> in 1954.
The two shades of blue in Carleton's doctoral gown are in fact those of the UN and are meant to recognize the University's long-standing interest and expertise in international affairs.

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p> [[Image:Maxwell MacOdrum.jpg|thumb|upright|Carleton
President and Vice-Chancellor [[Murdoch Maxwell MacOdrum]], left, with <a>Dag Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld</a>, Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel Laureate]] The mean admission grade for 2006 undergraduate entry was 81.7% or an A- in high school studies.
Carleton has been included in a number of Canadian and international <a>college and university rankings</a>.
Such studies must necessarily make subjective judgements as to criteria and methodology.
As such they should be read with a certain level of <a>statistical literacy</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On November 11, 2010 Maclean's magazine ranked Carleton number 7 of 12 in its comprehensive university rankings for the second year in a row.</li>
<li>In 2010, the Times World University Rankings placed Carleton in the 201st position (tying with the University of Maryland).</li>
<li>Carleton Ranked 7th in Macleans annual university rankings in the comprehensive category in 2008</li>
  <li>In the 2007 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> published by The Institute of Higher Education of <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, Carleton placed in the fourth quintile category (305th&#x2013;401st overall) of the top 500 universities of the world.
Seventeen Canadian universities ranked higher than 305.</li>
  <li>In the <a>THES - QS World University Rankings</a> of the top 500 universities in the world for 2009, Carleton University placed 386th.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carleton was not among 15 Canadian schools ranked in the top 200 Economics programs worldwide, according to research output, as reported in a study by Kalaitzidakis et al.</li>
  <li>In the tenth edition of the Gourman Report (1998), compiled by Dr Jack Gourman of the <a>Princeton Review</a>, ranked Carleton University 7th out of 60 universities in Canada.</li>
<li>Carleton University's Department of Physics is ranked 1st in Canada in citations per paper (highest impact) from 2000-2004 by Science Watch newsletter, published by Thomson Scientific, which uses university science indicators to examine the research of 46 Canadian universities in 21 different scientific fields.</li>
<li>The Department of Political Science is ranked 1st amongst Canadian comprehensive universities based on total publications and citations by Research Infosource Inc.
Today, the mean undergraduate admissions average is just under 82%, or an A- in High School studies.</p>
<p>Many undergraduates find it difficult to retain their scholarship, adding to their financial burden.
Only 18 percent of Carleton students retain their scholarship which has prompted Carleton's administration to consider lowering the CGPA necessary to maintain an award from year to year, although this is common among other universities.
At Carleton, a CGPA of 10 out of 12 points (equivalent to an A-), is necessary to maintain a scholarship.</p>
<p>Carleton has also turned around its financial situation, resulting in many improvements on campus.
These include, <em>inter alia</em>, the $30 million construction of new athletics facilities and the $22 million, 9,011&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (97,000&nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute Facility and Centre for Advanced Studies in Visualization and Simulation (V-SIM).
More well-known, perhaps, is the $17 million upgrade and expansion to the University Centre.
More recently<img> a green globe designed residence was added named Frontenac House.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Carleton is home to a number of specialty libraries, including The <a>MacOdrum Library</a>, named after former Carleton President and Vice-Chancellor <a>Murdoch Maxwell MacOdrum</a>, which includes more than three million items.
Other libraries include The Government Documents Collection, The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Collection, and The Special Collections &amp; Archives.</p>
<p>There are two resource centres: an audio visual resource centre, and a European and Russian Studies resource centre.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|Dunton Tower, the tallest structure on campus</a> The school mascot is the <a>Raven</a> and the student newspaper is <em><a>The Charlatan</a></em>, which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2005.

Broadcasting for the first time on 14 November 1975, CKCU-FM was the first licensed community-based campus radio station in Canada.
While Carleton does not have a theatre department, its <a>Sock 'n' Buskin Theatre Company</a> was founded two years after the founding of the university, in 1943.
The <a>Garden Spot</a> is a <a>Campus Kitchen</a> at Carleton University which was founded in 2002 by a <a>OPIRG</a> food issues working group.
The community kitchen operates during the school year serving pay-what-you-can vegan food to community members.
It is often referred to as &quot;The G-Spot.&quot;
Carleton has ten Houses of Residences.
The Houses &#x2014; all named after counties in <a>Eastern Ontario</a> - are inter-connected and linked to the rest of the University by Carleton's tunnel system.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p>Carleton is home to a number of fraternities and sororities, both local and international.
There is no &quot;Greek row&quot; on campus, nor are the fraternities/sororities formally acknowledged by the university.
However, the Carleton University Greek Council (of which nearly all fraternities and sororities are members) is recognized as a student organization by CUSA.
Fraternities and sororities are active on campus, participating in fund raising events, campus clean ups, days of service and more.
As well, many fraternity and sorority members hold high positions on CUSA, CASG, RRRA and other campus organizations, controlling many of the schools social events.</p>

<p>Carleton is home to <a>Keith Harris Stadium</a> where the <a>Ottawa Fury</a> Soccer team plays.</p>
<p>The University is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the <a>Carleton Ravens</a>.
The men's basketball team has won the CIS championships for five consecutive years (2002&#x2013;2007).
Carleton is second only to the <a>University of Victoria</a> for the most wins.
The <a>Vikes</a> have seven consecutive wins in the 1980s.</p>
<h2>Canadian Forces</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Ceremonial Guard marching in Ottawa</a> Each summer, <a>Canadian Forces</a> use Carleton residence facilities&#x2014;notably Russell and Grenville Houses and the Residence Commons cafeteria&#x2014;to house and feed the <a>Ceremonial Guard</a>.
The Guard performs daily parades on <a>Parliament Hill</a>, and mounts sentries at <a>Rideau Hall</a>, and the War Memorial.
This agreement is beneficial both to the university and the military, allowing the military to use cost-effective facilities, while Carleton profits during the otherwise slower summer season.</p>
<p>The Guard marches and drills at Carleton between June and August, and it is possible to watch formations carrying rifles in full ceremonial uniform marching to parking lots 6 and 7 to prepare for their daily parade.</p>
<p>Carleton University joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret'd) <a>Rick Hillier</a> for the families of fallen <a>Canadian Forces</a> members.</p>
