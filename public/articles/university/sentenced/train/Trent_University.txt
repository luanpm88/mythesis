<p>  <strong>Trent University</strong> is a <a>liberal arts</a> and science-oriented institution located along the <a>Otonabee River</a> in <a>Peterborough, Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>.
The enabling legislation is the <em>Trent University Act, 1962-63.</em>
The chancellor of Trent University is <a>Tom Jackson</a> and Dr. Steven E. Franklin is the president and vice-chancellor.</em></p>
<p>The Symons campus of Trent is approximately 5.6 km2, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life preserve.
It is divided into a series of colleges: <a>Champlain</a>, <a>Lady Eaton</a>,  <a>Catharine Parr Traill</a>, <a>Otonabee</a>, <a>Peter Gzowski</a>, and Julian Blackburn.
Each college has its own residence hall, dining room, and student government.
The exception to this rule is Julian Blackburn, which is a non-residential college and home to Trent's 1,700 part time students.
The campus plan and the original colleges were designed by the Canadian architect <a>Ron Thom</a>.
A large portion of the main campus consists of land that was donated by <a>GE</a> Canada.
This donation included a functioning <a>hydroelectric</a> power plant dating from the 1890s, and which still generates a substantial portion of the university's electricity; the power plant is being updated and a second generating plant being considered.</p>
<p>Trent also runs a full- and part-time program in Oshawa at the campus of the <a>University of Ontario Institute of Technology</a>, with an enrolment of over 800 students.
The university is represented in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> by the Trent Excalibur.
Some of the more notable specialized programs at Trent include the <a>Queen's University</a>/Trent concurrent education program, the Trent University School of Education, a joint program with <a>Fleming College</a>, in which students earn a B.Sc.F.S. in Forensic Science, as well as a B.Sc.N. program in Nursing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Another view of the Faryon Bridge (reverse angle from above), connecting the east and west banks of the Otonabee River.</a>
Trent University came about from public discussion in 1957 about the possibility of opening a <a>post-secondary</a> institution in the <a>Trent Valley</a>.
The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.
In 1963, the university opened Rubidge Hall, Traill College, and Peter Robinson College in 1964.
The governor general, Georges Vanier officially opened Trent University in 1964.</p>
<h3>Champlain College</h3>
<p>Located on Symons Campus along the Otonabee River, this college was opened in 1967.
It is named after the early 17th century explorer <a>Samuel de Champlain</a>, who explored the Otonabee area in 1615 and founded <a>Quebec City</a> in 1608 and whose sword is featured in the Trent crest.
It originally served as an all-male residence, along with Peter Robinson College.
The college is home to the Political Studies department and the Trent University Alumni Association.</p>
<h3>Lady Eaton College</h3>
<p>The fourth college, established in 1968, it is named in honour of Flora McCrea Eaton, <a>Lady Eaton</a>, one of the original sponsors of the university.
It contains the offices for the departments of History, Philosophy, <a>Women's Studies</a>, and Modern Languages.
It did originally serve as the Female Dorm, and still today has an all female section.

<h3>Otonabee College</h3>
<p><a>thumb|550px|Trent University; a view across the Otonabee river in Peterborough, Ontario, showing a part of the campus.
The Faryon bridge is to the right.</a>
Otonabee College was founded in 1972.
The buildings of Otonabee range along a cedar ridge overlooking the <a>river</a> from which the College derives its name (&#x201c;fast water&#x201d; in Nishnaabee).
To the east of the College are located the new buildings of the DNA Cluster and the Forensic Science program; beyond them a rolling rural landscape with a magnificent stand of blue spruce.
To the west are Peter Gzowski College and the Science buildings, leading to the Faryon pedestrian bridge, which provides easy access to the Bata Library, the Athletics Complex, and the colleges on the West Bank.
Eight &#x201c;houses&#x201d; connected by an interior walkway called &#x201c;the Link,&#x201d; make up Otonabee&#x2019;s residence.
The residence is co-educational, although there are single-sex areas within the houses.
Each house contains single and double study-bedrooms, a kitchenette, and a commons area.
A 2009 re-furnishing of some double rooms made use of loft beds to convert these into triples.
Past &#x201c;the Link,&#x201d; (a path leading to the instructional area of the College which bisects the residences) are a set of faculty offices, the mailboxes, College Porter&#x2019;s office,  and the main dining hall looking to the north and east of the grounds.
A large College Commons is located close to the Food Court/Dining Hall, with large-screen televisions and many comfortable chairs for relaxing.
Daily lunches are offered in a lounge atmosphere most afternoons.
The academic wing is directly connected with the Science Buildings and houses the School of Education, the departments of Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, and Computing &amp; Information Systems.
Teaching facilities include a 125-seat lecture theatre, various seminar rooms, laboratories for <a>Anthropology</a> and <a>Psychology</a> and <a>Computer Science</a>, and a <a>Sociology</a> resource room, offices for faculty in many of the disciplines in arts and sciences, and the Wenjack Theatre, which provides a venue for multimedia lecture presentations as well as theatrical productions by amateur and professional companies.
Nearby are the Archaeology Centre, Mackenzie House, and a wildlife sanctuary with walks and ski trails.
Students at Otonabee play a major role in organizing and conducting cultural, social and athletic activities.
The student government (Cabinet) and its committees cooperate with the College Office and dons in planning and delivering a variety of events for both its non-resident and resident members: visiting scholars, artists, musicians, scientists; College dinners and dances; Fall and Winter College Weekend; and intramural co-educational competitions in a number of sports.
Members of the College also participate in the wider academic, social, cultural and athletic activities of the University and the city of Peterborough, including various forms of community service.</p>
<h3>Peter Gzowski College</h3>
<p>Founded in 2003, it is the newest of the Trent University colleges.
It is named for <a>CBC</a> broadcaster <a>Peter Gzowski</a>, who was Trent's 8th chancellor.
At one point the college had two campuses: on Peterborough's Argyle Street in buildings leased from the <a>Eastern Pentecostal Bible College</a>, which housed the Teacher Education and Nursing programs; and the  Enweying building on the main Symons campus (&quot;enweying&quot; means &quot;the way we speak together&quot; in the <a>Anishinaabe language</a>.)
Enweying housed the Indigenous Studies, Economics, Mathematics and Business Administration programs.
Programs at the Argyle location were moved to Enweying prior to the 2006-2007 academic year.</p>
<h3>Peter Robinson College</h3>
<p>The first college to open at the university, it is dedicated to <a>Peter Robinson</a>, the member of the <a>Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada</a> who oversaw emigration of <a>Irish</a> settlers to the area in the 1820s.
The city of <a>Peterborough</a> is also named in his honour.
The college used to have a residence (apartment style) until its sale to a private landlord in 2004.
The college was shut down by the university administration, although many Peter Robinson students and faculty protested the closure.</p>
<p>By referendum in March, 2003, Trent students voted to create and operate a non-profit educational and cultural student facility, to be shared with the community as a whole.
Chosen to house this new facility was Sadleir House: one of the original university buildings at the PR site, it holds special historical significance for both the Trent and Peterborough communities.
Funded by a new student levy and organized as the <a>P.R. Community and Student Association (PRCSA)</a>, the students' offer to purchase the property was accepted by the current non-university owners.
The Trust secured a mortgage for the property and the students took possession of Sadleir House on 27 February 2004.
Currently, each student pays a levy fee each year of over $25 to support the mortgage on the house.
Among other things, Sadleir House contains the offices of the <em>Arthur</em>, the Trent student newspaper, and the Sadleir House Alternative Library.
Another building on the premises, housing Trent Radio headquarters, is also affiliated with the University.</p>
<h3>Julian Blackburn College</h3>
<p>This college offers programs for <a>part-time</a> students in Peterborough.
It is named after <a>Julian Blackburn</a>, who was one of the original professors who helped establish Trent.
Blackburn has no residences, as it handles the part-time students, but the Julian Blackburn building is home to Trent's administration, as well as medical, counseling, printing, parking, registrar, financial aid, student affairs, student accounts, and several other important university services.</p>
